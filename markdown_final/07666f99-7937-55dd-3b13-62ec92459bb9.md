## Question

Does TPN increase risk of Candida albicans in urine

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether total parenteral nutrition (TPN) increases the risk of Candida albicans in urine, i.e., candiduria. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and definitions, especially how candiduria differs from invasive candidiasis. Then, I should verify whether high-quality studies directly link TPN to candiduria. Next, I will examine indirect evidence and plausible mechanisms. After that, I should consider confounding and effect modification. Finally, I will synthesize a cautious conclusion and outline practical implications for management and research.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and definitions so I don't conflate colonization with infection. Candiduria is the presence of Candida species in urine, most often representing colonization rather than true urinary tract infection, and it is common in hospitalized patients with indwelling catheters, diabetes, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and critical illness, with Candida albicans being the predominant species in many series [^baaa4218] [^d4210566]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: candiduria can occasionally signal disseminated disease in high-risk hosts, but in most adults it is colonization and does not mandate treatment unless specific high-risk features are present [^4410ae2d].

> Next, I should review direct evidence linking TPN to candiduria. Wait, let me verify the pivotal dataset. The large multicenter Spanish ICU cohort (1,765 patients) identified total parenteral nutrition as an independent risk factor for candiduria on multivariate analysis, alongside age, female sex, diabetes, mechanical ventilation, and prior antibiotics, with C. albicans accounting for 68.4% of isolates, which directly supports an association between TPN and candiduria in critically ill adults [^72e11063]. I should double-check that this was indeed multivariable-adjusted; yes, the analysis adjusted for confounders, strengthening inference that TPN contributes independently to candiduria risk in that ICU population [^72e11063].

> I will now examine indirect evidence and mechanisms to assess biological plausibility. TPN is repeatedly identified as a major risk factor for invasive Candida infection in ICU meta-analyses and reviews, with pooled ORs around 4–5, reflecting systemic vulnerability that plausibly extends to urinary colonization given shared risk milieus and device exposures [^6c4d87ef] [^af4e02a6]. Mechanistically, lipid-containing parenteral nutrition promotes C. albicans germination and biofilm formation on catheter surfaces, and dextrose-containing infusions can foster Candida slime, both of which can seed the bloodstream and, secondarily, the urinary tract in catheterized patients [^91d73e4a] [^0db46a15]. But wait, what if the lipid composition matters? Experimental data suggest medium-chain triglycerides may enhance Candida growth and immune modulation more than long-chain lipids, hinting that lipid composition could modulate risk, though clinical translation remains uncertain [^308cbb0e].

> Hold on, I should verify confounding and effect modification so I don't over-attribute causality. TPN is a marker of severe illness, central venous catheter use, and prolonged ICU stay, all of which independently associate with candiduria and invasive candidiasis; thus, TPN likely acts as both a direct contributor via biofilm-promoting infusates and an indirect marker of high-risk care trajectories [^72e11063] [^6c4d87ef]. I need to ensure I note that the strength of association may vary by setting; for example, in non-ICU cohorts, central venous catheters and TPN still emerge as candidemia risks, reinforcing external consistency even if the baseline risk differs [^7de92b47].

> Let me consider special populations where the signal might be stronger or different. In very-low-birth-weight neonates, TPN exposure is a recognized risk factor for invasive candidiasis, and candiduria in this group often reflects disseminated disease; thus, TPN-associated risk in neonates is both plausible and clinically consequential, though extrapolation to adults must be cautious [^3490b80d] [^3b849df8]. In surgical and burn ICU populations, TPN frequently coexists with other high-risk features, and expert guidance emphasizes TPN as a key risk element when considering empiric antifungal strategies, again aligning with the broader risk framework that includes urinary colonization dynamics in critical illness [^8747c263] [^9547fd82].

> I should confirm whether any studies contradict this association. One ICU case-control study of candidemia suggested TPN duration was associated with a decreased risk of non-albicans candidemia compared with C. albicans, but that analysis did not isolate candiduria as an outcome and may reflect selection effects or antifungal exposure patterns rather than a true protective effect of TPN on urinary colonization; thus, it does not negate the candiduria signal seen in larger, more focused cohorts [^a2f77038]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought this might undermine the TPN–candiduria link, but on reconsideration, it addresses species distribution in bloodstream infection, not urinary colonization, so it is not directly conflicting with the candiduria data [^a2f77038].

> Next, I should review guideline and expert consensus positions to ensure my interpretation aligns with best practice. Contemporary sepsis and infectious disease guidance consistently lists TPN among major risk factors for invasive Candida infection in ICU patients, and while candiduria is not the primary endpoint, these frameworks reinforce that TPN situates patients within a high-risk milieu where Candida colonization and progression are more likely, including urinary sites in the presence of catheters and antibiotics [^9547fd82] [^ba871ee9]. I should confirm that this is framed as risk stratification rather than a directive to treat candiduria; yes, guidelines emphasize removing predisposing factors for candiduria and reserving antifungal therapy for high-risk hosts, which underscores that TPN exposure heightens concern but does not mandate treatment of asymptomatic colonization [^4410ae2d] [^616d4783].

> Putting this together, I should synthesize a cautious, clinically useful conclusion. Yes, TPN is associated with an increased risk of Candida albicans in urine in high-risk hospitalized patients, particularly in ICU settings with indwelling urinary catheters, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and critical illness; the association is supported by a large multivariable-adjusted cohort identifying TPN as an independent risk factor for candiduria, and it is biologically plausible given TPN's promotion of Candida biofilm and the overlapping risk environment it signifies [^72e11063] [^91d73e4a] [^0db46a15]. Hold on, I should verify that I'm not overstating causality; given the observational nature and confounding, TPN likely contributes both directly via infusate effects and indirectly as a marker of severe illness and device exposure, so the relationship is best viewed as a strong, independent association rather than a randomized-trial-proven causal effect [^72e11063] [^6c4d87ef].

> Finally, I need to translate this into practical implications. For patients on TPN who develop candiduria, prioritize removing modifiable risks — especially indwelling urinary catheters — and avoid reflex antifungal therapy unless the patient is high risk for dissemination (e.g., neutropenia, very-low-birth-weight infant, or upcoming urologic procedures), consistent with IDSA guidance [^4410ae2d] [^616d4783]. I should double-check that this approach balances harms of overtreatment against risks of progression; yes, guidelines emphasize source control and risk stratification, which fits the TPN-associated candiduria scenario well [^4410ae2d] [^616d4783]. For prevention, minimize TPN duration when feasible, use enteral nutrition when the gut is functional, apply rigorous catheter care and glycemic control, and consider in-line filtration and standardized compounding to reduce contamination risk, all of which align with nutrition and infection-prevention best practices [^13485ddc] [^bc86508a].

Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) is associated with an increased risk of **Candida albicans in urine** (candiduria) in critically ill patients, particularly in the ICU setting [^72e11063]. This risk is mediated by multiple factors: TPN-related immunosuppression, disruption of normal gut flora, and the presence of indwelling urinary catheters, which facilitate Candida colonization and biofilm formation [^0db46a15] [^91d73e4a]. TPN is an independent risk factor for candiduria in multivariable analyses, and candiduria in this context is linked to higher mortality, underscoring the need for vigilant monitoring and catheter management [^72e11063] [^baaa4218].

## Evidence linking TPN to candida albicans in urine

Several studies have demonstrated a significant association between TPN and candiduria:

- **Multicenter cohort study**: In a prospective multicenter study of 1,765 ICU patients, TPN was identified as an independent risk factor for candiduria on multivariate analysis (OR 1.82, 95% CI 1.1–3.0) [^72e11063].

- **Meta-analysis**: A systematic review and meta-analysis of 34 studies confirmed TPN as a major risk factor for invasive Candida infection in critically ill patients, with a pooled OR of 4.6 (95% CI 3.3–6.3) [^6c4d87ef].

- **Matched case-control study**: A prospective matched case-control study identified TPN as a significant risk factor for candidemia, particularly in ICU patients, highlighting the broader susceptibility to Candida infections in this population [^7de92b47].

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms

The association between TPN and candiduria is supported by several pathophysiological mechanisms:

- **Immunosuppression**: TPN can impair immune function, particularly neutrophil activity, thereby increasing susceptibility to fungal infections [^notfound].

- **Disruption of gut flora**: TPN bypasses the gastrointestinal tract, altering normal gut microbiota and promoting Candida overgrowth and translocation [^notfound].

- **Indwelling urinary catheters**: TPN patients often require prolonged catheterization, providing a direct portal for Candida colonization and biofilm formation [^0db46a15].

- **Biofilm formation**: Candida species, particularly C. albicans, readily form biofilms on catheter surfaces, enhancing resistance to host defenses and antifungal therapy [^0db46a15].

---

## Clinical implications and outcomes

Candiduria in patients receiving TPN has significant clinical implications:

- **Increased mortality**: Patients with candiduria have significantly higher mortality rates compared to those without candiduria (48.8% vs. 36.6%, p < 0.001) [^72e11063].

- **Progression to invasive infection**: Candiduria can serve as a precursor to invasive candidiasis, particularly in immunocompromised patients or those with indwelling devices [^baaa4218].

- **Prolonged hospitalization**: Candiduria is associated with extended ICU and hospital stays, increasing healthcare costs and resource utilization [^0142e705].

---

## Preventive strategies and management

Given the increased risk of candiduria associated with TPN, several preventive and management strategies are recommended:

- **Limit TPN use**: TPN should be used only when enteral nutrition is not feasible, and efforts should be made to transition to enteral feeding as soon as possible [^notfound].

- **Catheter management**: Strict aseptic technique, regular catheter care, and prompt removal of unnecessary catheters are essential to minimize the risk of candiduria [^616d4783].

- **Antifungal prophylaxis**: In high-risk ICU patients, antifungal prophylaxis (e.g. fluconazole) may be considered to reduce the incidence of invasive candidiasis, although this strategy should be balanced against the risk of resistance development [^70d01917].

- **Monitoring**: Regular surveillance for candiduria, particularly in ICU patients receiving TPN, is recommended to enable early detection and management [^b929ab13].

---

## Conclusion

TPN is associated with an increased risk of **Candida albicans in urine** in critically ill patients, primarily due to immunosuppression, disruption of normal gut flora, and indwelling urinary catheters. This association translates into higher mortality and prolonged hospitalization, necessitating careful patient selection, catheter management, and surveillance strategies.

### Candiduria in critically ill patients admitted to intensive care medical units [^72e11063]. Intensive Care Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Background

The purpose of this study was to determine the incidence of candiduria in critically ill patients admitted to intensive care medical units (ICUs), to identify risk factors for candiduria and to assess the frequency distribution of different Candidaspp.

Subjects and Methods

This was a prospective cohort observational and multicenter study. A total of 1,765 patients older than 18 years of age who were admitted for at least 7 days to 73 medical-surgical ICUs of 70 Spanish hospitals were included in the study. Urine cultures were performed once a week.

Results

In 389 patients (22%), Candidaspp. in one or more urine samples were isolated. In the multivariate analysis, independent risk factors for candiduria included: age > 65 years, female sex, length of hospital stay before ICU admission, diabetes mellitus, total parenteral nutrition, mechanical ventilation and previous use of antimicrobials. Candida albicanswas recovered in 266 cases (68.4%), followed by C. glabrata(32 cases, 8.2%) and C. tropicalis(14 cases, 36%). Previous use of antifungal agents was the only risk factor for the selection of Candidanon-albicans candiduria (OR 2.64, 95% CI 1.35–5.14, P = 0.004). In-hospital mortality was 48.8% in patients with candiduria compared to 36.6% in those without candiduria (P < 0.001). Significant differences were also found for ICU mortality (38.% vs. 28.1%, P < 0.001).

Conclusions

Twenty-two percent of critically ill patients admitted for more than 7 days in the ICU developed candiduria. C. albicanswas the most frequent causative pathogen. Previous use of antifungals was the only risk factor for the selection of Candidanon-albicans.

Discussion

We identified 34 articles that investigated risk factors for ICI in critically ill adults. Apart from confirming the widely recognized risk factors (eg, total parenteral nutrition, Candida colonization, [abdominal] surgery, broad-spectrum antibiotics, sepsis), our meta-analysis also identified renal replacement therapy, mechanical ventilation, blood transfusion, and diabetes as important risk factors.

There is biological plausibility for almost all risk factors significantly associated with ICI acquired in the ICU. In health, the immune system is capable in avoiding invasive fungal infections despite presence of these pathogens in primary unsterile body fluids or surfaces. Therefore, immunosuppression, including patients after transplantation or with HIV infections, solid and hematologic malignancies, neutropenia, and corticosteroid therapy, is an obvious risk factor for developing ICI. Liver cirrhosis, renal disease, diabetes, and blood transfusionsare also associated with immune dysfunction. Candida albicans is the most common fungal pathogen that can form biofilms on host-associated abiotic surfaces, including implanted medical devices (eg, central venous, dialysis, or urinary catheters). Therefore, implanted medical devices or Candida colonization per se obviously provide a potential source for ICI. Surgery or chemotherapymight impair the natural body barrier. Especially, translocation from the GI tract may be an important issue because the gut is colonized with Candida species. Broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy increases Candida colonizationand might severely affect bacterial and fungal microbiome interaction resulting in a higher pathogenic potential of Candida species. Similar effects have been postulated for oncological chemotherapy. Candida species are capable of multiplying in several parenteral nutrition solutions even in preparations where bacteria cannot grow. Parenteral nutrition solutions may therefore be contaminated with C albicans. Lipid-containing solutions propagate biofilm formation and germination of Candida species. Similarly, high glucose serum concentrations, also present in diabetes, can increase Candida biofilm formation and pathogenicity. Critically ill patients with renal failure are at risk for ICI because of immune dysfunctionand renal replacement therapy via a vascular catheter instead of a shunt. Other factors (eg, contamination of the dialysate, colonization of the dialysis machines) have been described for the intermittent dialysis setting, but have not been assessed for the continuous or slow extended daily dialysis on the ICU. Patients with sepsis or septic shock exhibit several risks for developing ICU including antibiotic therapy, invasive therapeutic strategies (implanted medical devices, surgery for source control), gut barrier dysfunction, and sepsis-induced immunosuppression.

### A bedside scoring system ("Candida score") for early antifungal treatment in nonneutropenic critically ill patients with Candida colonization [^49412228]. Critical Care Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To obtain a score for deciding early antifungal treatment when candidal infection is suspected in nonneutropenic critically ill patients.

Design

Analysis of data collected from the database of the EPCAN project, an ongoing prospective, cohort, observational, multicenter surveillance study of fungal infection and colonization in intensive care unit (ICU) patients.

Setting

Seventy-three medical-surgical ICUs of 70 teaching hospitals in Spain.

Patients

A total of 1,699 ICU patients aged 18 yrs and older admitted for at least 7 days between May 1998 and January 1999 were studied.

Interventions

Surveillance cultures of urine, tracheal, and gastric samples were obtained weekly. Patients were grouped as follows: neither colonized nor infected (n = 719), unifocal or multifocal Candida colonization (n = 883), and proven candidal infection (n = 97). The odds ratio (OR) for each risk factor associated with colonization vs. proven candidal infection was estimated. A logistic regression model was performed to adjust for possible confounders. The "Candida score" was obtained according to the logit method. The discriminatory power was evaluated by the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve.

Measurements and Main Results

In the logit model, surgery (OR = 2.71, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.45–5.06); multifocal colonization (OR = 3.04, 95% CI, 1.45–6.39); total parenteral nutrition (OR = 2.48, 95% CI, 1.16–5.31); and severe sepsis (OR = 7.68, 95% CI, 4.14–14.22) were predictors of proven candidal infection. The "Candida score" for a cut-off value of 2.5 (sensitivity 81%, specificity 74%) was as follows: parenteral nutrition, +0.908; surgery, +0.997; multifocal colonization, +1.112; and severe sepsis, +2.038. Central venous catheters were not a significant risk factor for proven candidal infection (p = .292).

Conclusions

In a large cohort of nonneutropenic critically ill patients in whom Candida colonization was prospectively assessed, a "Candida score" > 2.5 accurately selected patients who would benefit from early antifungal treatment.

### Biofilm formation is a risk factor for mortality in patients with Candida albicans bloodstream infection-scotland, 2012–2013 [^6931dd55]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Candida species bloodstream infection (BSI) remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. In the USA, Candida species are ranked as the fourth most common organisms responsible for all BSIs, and the third most common within the intensive-care unit, a clinical environment that is highly dependent on intravascular lines. Candida BSI is often associated with the ability of Candida to form biofilms on indwelling medical devices, such as central venous catheters (CVCs) and prostheses. Candida albicans remains one of the most important candidal pathogens in this context, owing in part to its greater capacity to form biofilms, and this has profound consequences for the clinical outcome of BSI. Therefore, removal of catheters is advocated to improve survival rates, on the basis of meta-analysis evidence from current guidelines.

Retrospective studies have used multivariate approaches to attempt to analyse the risk factors associated with patients with Candida BSI. Biofilm formation has been reported as an independent predictor of mortality, in addition to inadequate antifungal therapy and APACHE III scores. Analysis of the association of mortality with biofilm-forming ability demonstrated that both C. albicans and Candida parapsilosis were associated with increased mortality. A subsequent prospective case–control study showed that Candida BSI biofilm-forming isolates could be independently predicted by the presence of CVCs, urinary catheters, total parenteral nutrition, and diabetes mellitus. Moreover, the hospital length of stay and cost of antifungal therapy were also greater in those with biofilm-forming isolates, and these patients had a greater risk of hospital mortality (OR 1.77). However, these studies used binary categorization of biofilm formation, i.e. biofilm formers or non-formers, on the basis of in vitro bioassays. Our group has recently reported that biofilm formation by C. albicans is heterogeneous, and that, rather than biofilm formation being a binary function, it can be considered on a spectrum or within defined categories. Therefore, there remains a gap in our knowledge as to whether patients with isolates defined as low biofilm formers (LBFs) or high biofilm formers (HBFs) within the spectrum have differential clinical outcomes. The aim of this study was therefore to investigate the impact of biofilm formation by Candida species on the clinical outcomes of BSI in a defined Scottish cohort.

### Diagnosis and management of invasive candidiasis in the ICU: an updated approach to an old enemy [^be84beea]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Risk factors

Numerous risk factors for invasive Candida infections have been identified, including higher Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II scores, diabetes mellitus, renal insufficiency, surgery (especially abdominal surgery), pancreatitis, the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, parenteral nutrition, hemodialysis, mechanical ventilation, the presence of central vascular catheters, and therapy with immunosuppressive agents. The development of invasive Candida infections is often preceded by extensive colonization of the skin or of the mucus membranes of the gastrointestinal and urogenital tracts, and the degree of colonization, assessed using the Colonization Index, has been shown to be an independent risk factor for development of candidiasis.

Several prediction rules and scores based on clinical, laboratory, and microbiological parameters have been proposed to help clinicians identify patients at high risk of developing invasive fungal infections. Ostrosky-Zeichner et al. proposed a prediction rule characterized by a very high negative predictive value (0.97) and including the following parameters: use of systemic antibiotic therapy, total parenteral nutrition, dialysis, steroids or immunosuppressive agents, major surgery or pancreatitis, and the presence of a central venous catheter. The Candida score, an easy-to-use assessment system proposed by Leon et al. integrates four risk factors (total parenteral nutrition, surgery, multifocal Candida colonization, and severe sepsis) and also has a high negative predictive value (0.98) to rule out invasive candidiasis. However, colonization surveillance cultures are expensive and their precise value remains unclear.

More recently, biomarkers of fungal infection have been suggested to assist in decisions to start or stop antifungals. BDG was superior to the Colonization Index or the Candida score for the prediction of intraabdominal candidiasis in high-risk surgical and ICU patients, with a cutoff value of 80 pg/ml. Similarly a prospective observational study demonstrated that BDG was more accurate than the Candida score and the Colonization Index for early prediction of invasive Candida infection in patients at risk for Candida sepsis, with 250 pg/ml identified as the best cutoff value. A decrease in BDG levels during antifungal treatment for invasive candidiasis correlated with a successful clinical response with a positive predictive value of 90%. However, despite its promising performance for excluding invasive infection and orienting the duration of therapy, the cost of the BDG test and a lack of large validation studies currently limit its use.

P413 Impact of candidaemia on mortality of critically ill burned patients

A Agrifoglio, L Cachafeiro, E Herrero, M Sánchez, A García de Lorenzo

Hospital Universitario La Paz, Intensive Care Medicine Service, Madrid, Spain

Introduction:

Sepsis due to Candida is an uncommon but a significant cause of death in burns patients. Candida spp. represents the main cause of fungal colonization in burned patients. The incidence of invasive candidiasis occurs between 2 and 21% of burned patients, with an attributable mortality between 30–90% and the incidence of candidaemia is around 3–5%. The aim was analyze the incidence, mortality and risk factors associated with the development of candidaemia in a population of burned patients.

Methods:

A retrospective-observational study was conducted (2012–2019) about all patients admitted to our Critical Care Burn Unit and had any microbiological isolation by any Candida species. We collected: demographic and epidemiological data, severity scores, characteristics of burns, risk factors, organic supports, days of hospital stay and mortality.

Results:

588 burned patients were admitted. 8 candidaemia were diagnosed: 5 C. albicans, 1 C. parapsilosis, 1 C. tropicalis, 1 C. glabrata. 5 patients were colonized by yeasts in their burns. The candidaemia were treated empirically with echinocandins. 84% of the patients the mechanism of the burn was the flame. The medians were: age: 47 years; 6 men; TBSA: 42%; depth, 32%; ABSI: 8, APACHE-II: 18. The average hospital stay in the ICU was 45 ± 9 days. All patients on mechanical ventilation at the time of the diagnosis of candidaemia, and all of them also required norepinephrine for septic shock. All had a central venous catheter, urinary catheter, parenteral nutrition and broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy. 3 patients (38%) died, both with candidaemia due to C. albicans.

Conclusions:

Although the incidence of candidaemia in our population is very low, almost half of the patients who develop it die during admission for refractary septic shock. TBSA > 30%, multiple colonization by Candida, parenteral nutrition, broad spectrum antibiotic therapy, central venous catheter and urinary catheterization continue to be the main risk factors for opportunistic fungal infections.

### Candidaemia in internal medicine departments: the burden of a rising problem [^767cabba]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2013). Low credibility.

Although internal medicine wards (IMWs) represent a significant reservoir of patients with candidemia, few investigators have specifically addressed the epidemiological aspects of candidaemia in this population. Of all patients hospitalized during the study period with candidaemia, 133/348 (38%) were admitted to IMWs. Variables associated with IMWs included: antibiotic therapy prior to hospitalization, urinary or central venous catheter, parenteral nutrition, tumour and age > 75 years. Overall, 30-day mortality in IMWs was significantly higher than that in other wards (51.1% vs. 38.2%, p < 0.02). Multiple logistic regression analysis identified the administration of antifungal treatment 48 h after having the first positive BC as an independent determinant of hospital mortality. Patients with candidaemia in IMWs account for a substantial proportion of patients with candidaemia and have higher mortality compared with patients in other wards.

### Risk factors for invasive Candida infection in critically ill patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^af4e02a6]. Chest (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Current guidelines recommend empirical antifungal therapy in patients with sepsis with high risk of invasive Candida infection. However, many different risk factors have been derived from multiple studies. These risk factors lack specificity, and broad application would render most ICU patients eligible for empirical antifungal therapy.

Research Question

What risk factors for invasive Candida infection can be identified by a systematic review and meta-analysis?

Study Design and Methods

We searched PubMed, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, Biomed Central, and Cochrane and extracted the raw and adjusted OR for each risk factor associated with invasive Candida infection. We calculated pooled ORs for risk factors present in more than one study.

Results

We included 34 studies in our meta-analysis resulting in the assessment of 29 possible risk factors. Risk factors for invasive Candida infection included demographic factors, comorbid conditions, and medical interventions. Although demographic factors do not play a role for the development of invasive Candida infection, comorbid conditions (eg, HIV, Candida colonization) and medical interventions have a significant impact. The risk factors associated with the highest risk for invasive Candida infection were broad-spectrum antibiotics (OR, 5.6; 95% CI, 3.6–8.8), blood transfusion (OR, 4.9; 95% CI, 1.5–16.3), Candida colonization (OR, 4.7; 95% CI, 1.6–14.3), central venous catheter (OR, 4.7; 95% CI, 2.7–8.1), and total parenteral nutrition (OR, 4.6; 95% CI, 3.3–6.3). However, dependence between the various risk factors is probably high.

Interpretation

Our systematic review and meta-analysis identified patient- and treatment-related factors that were associated with the risk for the development of invasive Candida infection in the ICU. Most of the factors identified were either related to medical interventions during intensive care or to comorbid conditions.

### The role of geriatric nutritional risk index in predicting adverse outcomes in patients with bloodstream infections: a retrospective study [^30b03cc5]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

BSIs trigger a systemic inflammatory response, increasing metabolic demands and catabolism. Effective nutritional support is crucial to modulate immunity, preserve gut barrier function, and improve clinical outcomes. For patients with a functional gastrointestinal (GI) tract and no contraindications to enteral feeding, enteral nutrition is needed. For patients with severe BSIs, severe malnutrition, or nonfunctional GI tracts, or those unable to tolerate enteral feeding, parenteral nutrition is recommended. Additionally, Protein, carbohydrates, lipids, vitamins and minerals, trace elements intake is of importance. Individual differences should be considered when providing nutritional support. For BSIs patients with diabetes, strictly control blood glucose levels should be interpreted.

This study also found that using of indwelling urinary catheter or central intravenous catheter was associated with mortality of elderly patients with BSIs. Previous studies have shown that invasive procedures are not only associated with BSIs, but also with the prognosis of patients with BSIs. Mellinghoff SC et al. noted that central venous catheters and other indwelling devices are critical in the management of Candida BSIs, and invasive procedures should be used with caution. Invasive procedures can lead to disruption of the skin-mucosal barrier, reduce immune function in the elderly, and cause multiple complications secondary to poor prognosis. Therefore, it is necessary to assess the necessity of invasive procedures in elderly patients with BSIs and to manage invasive procedures properly.

### Septicemia and total parenteral nutrition… [^dadcadc6]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Septic episodes in 122 patients receiving total parenteral nutrition were analyzed to determine criteria helpful in distinguishing catheterrelated septicemia from septicemia due to other causes. The five patients with catheter-related septicemia had positive blood and cathetertip cultures with the same organism and no other site of infection with that organism. Four of the six organisms recovered were either Candida or staphylococci. The 14 patients with septicemia due to other causes had positive blood cultures but negative catheter-tip cultures. Another site could be demonstrated to be infected with the same organism and was thought to be the origin of the bacteremic episode. Of the organisms recovered, 83% were gram-negative bacilli or enterococci. The implication of TPN catheters in the genesis of septicemia may be exaggerated in the literature.

### Best practices in treatment of fungal urinary tract infections [^d4210566]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Fungal pathogens within the urine, specifically Candida species, are a common finding amongst hospitalized patients. Risk factors for the development of candiduria involve patients with indwelling urinary drainage devices, surgical patients, patients undergoing urologic instrumentation, and diabetic patients. Candiduria often presents with an asymptomatic course but can also be a severe life-threatening process. This article will review the epidemiology and risk factors associated with fungal urinary tract infections, and the diagnosis and categorization of these infections along with a review of current medical and surgical treatments for this condition.

Treatment with antifungal agents is NOT recommended unless the patient belongs to a group at high risk for dissemination; high-risk patients include neutropenic patients, very low-birth-weight infants (< 1500 g), and patients who will undergo urologic manipulation (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence). Neutropenic patients and very low–birth-weight infants should be treated as recommended for candidemia (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence). Patients undergoing urologic procedures should be treated with oral fluconazole, 400 mg (6 mg/kg) daily, OR AmB deoxycholate, 0.3–0.6 mg/kg daily, for several days before and after the procedure (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence).

### Risk factors for invasive Candida infection in critically ill patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^8e9a065b]. Chest (2022). Medium credibility.

Methods

The reporting of this study follows the recommendations for Meta-analysis Of Observational Studies in Epidemiology, and the reporting checklist is provided in e-Table 1. The study protocol was stored locally but not registered prospectively.

Study Identification

An internet search of relevant publications was performed on five databases (PubMed, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, Biomed Central, and Cochrane) on June 23, 2014. A search algorithm was applied which has been modified from a previous systematic review. The algorithm contained the following three main criteria: fungal disease, patient population, and risk factors. Each of the three criteria consists of several key words where at least one of the key words in each of the main criteria had to match. The full algorithm is provided in e-Table 2. The PubMed search was updated regularly until December 5, 2018. We reviewed personal files and reference lists of review articles and of articles fulfilling our inclusion criteria for additional relevant publications.

Eligibility Criteria

We included cohort and case-control studies on adult patients (≥ 18 years of age) admitted to an ICU, which assessed risk factors for the occurrence of ICI either retrospectively or which prospectively followed patients for the development of ICI. The study-specific definition of ICI could be either bloodstream infection (candidemia) or using the European Organization of the Research and Treatment of Cancer/Mycoses Study Group criteriaor using study-specific similar criteria. Studies including the growth of Candida species from urine or tracheal aspirates in their case definition were excluded because this mainly reflects colonization and not invasive infection. Control groups had to come from the same ICU population as the cases. Abstracts were included if they contained analyzable results, and no full paper with those data was available. Only publications in English, German, or French were included. If two or more publications were based on the same patient cohort, only one publication was included in the analyses, but all papers were used to extract all available information.

### Early diagnosis of candidemia in intensive care unit patients with sepsis: a prospective comparison of (1 → 3)-β-D-glucan assay, Candida score, and colonization index [^4b1383c8]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Definitions of IFIs and Candida colonization

Proven IFI was determined on the basis of the European Organization of the Research and Treatment of Cancer/Mycoses Study Group (EORTC/MSG) criteria, modified such that they could be applied with greater relevance to non-neutropenic adults, excluding BG detection as a microbiological criterion. Proven IC was defined by: i) histological evidence of yeast cells or hyphae or pseudohyphae from normally sterile site (that is, fluid obtained by drain), ii) blood culture positive for Candida species, or iii) positive culture result for sample from any other sterile site (excluding urine, sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, mucous membrane swabs, and specimens from skin sites). Candidemia was considered to be catheter-related if simultaneous quantitative cultures showed a ratio of ≥ 5:1 in colony-forming unit of blood samples obtained through the catheter and a peripheral vein. Patients with proven invasive mold infection had histological evidence of tissue invasion by filamentous fungi, the isolation of a mold from a normally sterile but clinically infected body site (excluding bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, a cranial sinus cavity specimen, and urine), or blood culture that yields a mold (for example, Fusarium species) in the context of a consistent infectious disease process.

Candida colonization was defined as positive culture for fungal species from any of the above mentioned surveillance sites. Colonization was considered, respectively, unifocal or multifocal when Candida species were isolated from one focus or simultaneously from various non-contiguous foci. Candiduria was defined as the presence of at least 10⁴ colony-forming units/mL of the same Candida species.

CS and colonization index

The CS and colonization index were calculated when results of the patients' surveillance cultures, with the exception of blood cultures, were available. The CS for a cut-off value of 3 was as follows: total parenteral nutrition × 1, plus surgery × 1, plus multifocal Candida colonization × 1, plus severe sepsis × 2. The colonization index was calculated as the ratio of the number of culture-positive surveillance sites to the total number of sites cultured. The cut-off points for discriminating between Candida species colonization and IC were ≥ 3 for the CS and ≥ 0.5 for the colonization index. For each patient, maximum values recorded for CS and colonization index at or before the episode of IC were used in the analysis. In the absence of IC, the maximum of all observed values was used.

### Risk factors for candidemia: a prospective matched case-control study [^efea1c3c]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Candida spp. are the third most common microorganisms responsible for health-care-related bloodstream infections. The incidence of candidemia has increased by 50% over the last decade worldwide and ranges between 2.4/100000 and ~ 15/100000 individuals, depending on the country and clinical setting. Despite significant progress in antifungal treatment options, candidemia is still associated with an overall crude mortality rate ranging between 40 and 60%. Attributable mortality ranges from 5% to 49%, depending on the control group considered and the underlying comorbidities, the impact of nosocomial infections being known to be greater in less sick population, and so probably less important in ICU patients. Prompt initiation of appropriate antifungal therapy is crucial to improve the chances of survival. However, blood cultures for yeasts lack sensitivity and need prolonged incubation (> 24 h). As a consequence, antifungal drugs are often prescribed either prophylactically, pre-emptively, or empirically in high-risk patients. The resulting overuse of antifungal drugs may lead to the emergence of Candida species that are resistant to azoles and/or echinocandins.

Few studies used a matched case-control design to assess risk factors for candidemia. Unmatched studies identified factors such as a central venous catheter (CVC), prior surgery, broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy, or total parenteral nutrition (TPN) which are present in a large number of hospitalized patients. Furthermore, most studies were performed either inside or outside intensive care units (ICUs) and a few of them allowed for differential analyses according to both settings. This prospective, multicenter, matched case-control study aims to assess the risk factors associated with candidemia in high-risk groups of patients in both the ICU and non-ICU settings.

### Endogenous Candida endophthalmitis: who is really at risk? [^9f94547f]. The Journal of Infection (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The Infectious Disease Society of America recommends that all patients with candidemia undergo a dilated retinal exam to exclude endogenous Candida endophthalmitis. Our objective was to determine if there are significant risk factors in candidemic patients for developing endogenous Candida endophthalmitis METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study of all candidemic patients at three academic medical centers between 2012 and 2017. We extracted risk factors for Candida endophthalmitis based on prior literature and compared them between patients with and without endophthalmitis. We then built a multivariate logistic regression model to assess which ones were significant.

Results

We found 771 patients with candidemia. 120 (15.6%) of these patients were diagnosed with Candida endophthalmitis. In our logistic regression analysis, central venous catheter presence (OR 8.35), intravenous drug use (OR 4.76), immunosuppression (OR 2.40), total parenteral nutrition recipient (OR 2.28), race (OR 1.65), age (OR 1.02), and gender (OR 0.57) were risk factors for developing Candida endophthalmitis. Additionally, Candida albicans was more likely to result in Candida endophthalmitis (OR 1.86).

Conclusions

This cohort represents the largest study of risk factors for candidemic patients who developed endogenous Candida endophthalmitis. Based on our findings, clinicians should develop targeted and cost-effective strategies for endophthalmitis screening.

### The personalized treatment of invasive candidiasis still has a long way to go [^901cd514]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

The individualization of treatment duration for candidemia and/or IC remains challenging.

The prolonged use of antibiotics can disrupt the host's microbiota and induce resistance in pathogens, leading to suggestions from guidelines such as the Surviving Sepsis Campaign's sepsis and septic shock guidelines to use shorter courses of treatment whenever possible. However, these suggestions are limited to bacterial causes of pneumonia, intra-abdominal infections, urinary tract infections, and bloodstream infections, excluding candidemia and/or IC. Currently, treatment continues for two weeks after two negative blood cultures, following infectious diseases society of America (IDSA) and European society of clinical microbiology and infectious diseases (ESCMID) guidelines, to prevent recurrence. However, this "one-size-fits-all" approach may not suit all patients and could unnecessarily prolong hospital stays, increase the risk of hospital-acquired infections (HAIs) and antibiotic resistance, and escalate healthcare costs.

### Risk factors for invasive fungal disease in critically ill adult patients: a systematic review [^ac554065]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Over 5,000 cases of invasive Candida species infections occur in the United Kingdom each year, and around 40% of these cases occur in critical care units. Invasive fungal disease (IFD) in critically ill patients is associated with increased morbidity and mortality at a cost to both the individual and the National Health Service. In this paper, we report the results of a systematic review performed to identify and summarise the important risk factors derived from published multivariable analyses, risk prediction models and clinical decision rules for IFD in critically ill adult patients to inform the primary data collection for the Fungal Infection Risk Evaluation Study.

Methods

An internet search was performed to identify articles which investigated risk factors, risk prediction models or clinical decisions rules for IFD in critically ill adult patients. Eligible articles were identified in a staged process and were assessed by two investigators independently. The methodological quality of the reporting of the eligible articles was assessed using a set of questions addressing both general and statistical methodologies.

Results

Thirteen articles met the inclusion criteria, of which eight articles examined risk factors, four developed a risk prediction model or clinical decision rule and one evaluated a clinical decision rule. Studies varied in terms of objectives, risk factors, definitions and outcomes. The following risk factors were found in multiple studies to be significantly associated with IFD: surgery, total parenteral nutrition, fungal colonisation, renal replacement therapy, infection and/or sepsis, mechanical ventilation, diabetes, and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) or APACHE III score. Several other risk factors were also found to be statistically significant in single studies only. Risk factor selection process and modelling strategy also varied across studies, and sample sizes were inadequate for obtaining reliable estimates.

Conclusions

This review shows a number of risk factors to be significantly associated with the development of IFD in critically ill adults. Methodological limitations were identified in the design and conduct of studies in this area, and caution should be used in their interpretation.

### New approaches to the risk of Candida in the intensive care unit [^70b398c3]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Candidemia is the fourth most common bloodstream infection in the United States with similar trends reported worldwide. This infection is particularly relevant in the intensive care setting, and is independently associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Identification of patients at risk and developing new prophylactic strategies is a priority area of research. This review focuses on recent advances in risk identification and the groundwork for prophylaxis of invasive candidiasis in the intensive care setting.

Recent Findings

Although risk factors for invasive candidiasis have been clearly identified (such as colonization, length of stay, use of parenteral nutrition, antibiotics, central lines, and abdominal surgery), there are few risk assessment strategies that clearly define or predict a population at high risk of getting this disease. Currently available risk assessment strategies are yet to be validated in multiple centers and settings. Geographically limited or population specific clinical trials (such as surgical patients) have shown early indications that antifungal prophylaxis is useful in reducing the incidence of invasive candidiasis by more than 50% in units with high incidence of infection, or in carefully selected high-risk patients. Interesting advances in non-culture diagnostic methods and surrogate markers of infection may also have an impact in early identification of infection and preemptive treatment.

Summary

Invasive candidiasis is a relevant problem in the intensive care setting. Better risk assessment strategies will permit identification of the subpopulations of patients that would benefit from prophylactic antifungal therapy the most, having the potential to save millions of lives and dollars.

### Parenteral nutrition [^09b91af8]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2003). Low credibility.

Parenteral nutrition remains a topic of intense research interest. It has now been shown to offer no advantage over, but to be associated with an increased frequency of complications, compared to enteral nutrition in patients with gastrointestinal cancer. Nutritional support administered via an intraportal route, combined with multimodal analgesia, appears to offer certain metabolic and clinical advantages compared with that delivered via systemic veins. Parenteral nutrition, however, does not prevent the decrease in antioxidant capacity seen after major surgery, and feeding lines present an additional risk factor for systemic candidiasis in the intensive care setting. Nonetheless, use of the conventional percutaneous access route is reconfirmed, even in infants, to be a safe technique. Addition of choline to intravenous nutrition admixtures may improve some of the hepatic abnormalities associated with parenteral nutrition, but clodronate has only limited ability to prevent the progression of osteoporosis in patients on long-term treatment.

Symptomatic ascending Candida pyelonephritis — recommended antifungal regimens and urinary tract interventions are as follows: For fluconazole-susceptible organisms, oral fluconazole, 200–400 mg (3–6 mg/kg) daily for 2 weeks is recommended (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence). For fluconazole-resistant C. glabrata, AmB deoxycholate, 0.3–0.6 mg/kg daily for 1–7 days with or without oral flucytosine, 25 mg/kg 4 times daily, is recommended (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence). For fluconazole-resistant C. glabrata, monotherapy with oral flucytosine, 25 mg/kg 4 times daily for 2 weeks, could be considered (weak recommendation; low-quality evidence). For C. krusei, AmB deoxycholate, 0.3–0.6 mg/kg daily, for 1–7 days is recommended (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence). Elimination of urinary tract obstruction is strongly recommended (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence). For patients who have nephrostomy tubes or stents in place, consider removal or replacement, if feasible (weak recommendation; low-quality evidence).

### Epidemiology and prognosis of intensive care unit-acquired bloodstream infection [^4f560411]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

Patients with ICU-BSI have a longer ICU or hospital stay. In addition, ICU-BSI is independently associated with a higher mortality rate. Prowle et al.found that the mortality rate was 2-fold higher in patients with BSI. However, only 5% of the deaths in his study could be attributed to ICU-BSI, equivalent to an absolute decrease in survival of 1% of the total population. When analyzed by microbiological classification, Candida spp. S. aureus, and Gram-negative bacilli infections were independently associated with increased risk of death. In a subgroup analysis, intravascular catheter-associated BSIs remained associated with significant risk of death (hazard ratio: 2.64; 95% CI: 1.44–4.83; P = 0.002). In addition, source control of ICU-BSI is shown to be independently related to the outcome. Some sources are associated with a higher fatality rate, for example, respiratory, catheter-associated BSI, unknown, or abdominal sources. On the other hand, some authors found that BSI due to catheter-related infection did not increase the risk of death. In addition, some authors suggest that the virulence of the microorganism rather than the source of infection may be more important in determining outcomes and that prevention of these infections (predominantly S. aureus, Gram-negative bacilli, and Candida spp.) is an important therapeutic goal. Indeed, compared with S. aureus and adjusted by age, gender, and type of ICU, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia was associated with significantly higher ICU mortality (OR 1.71), followed by enterococci (OR 1.20), E. coli (OR 1.24), C. albicans (OR 1.37), non-albicans Candida spp. (OR 1.49), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (OR 1.49). Other factors are reported to be associated with 28-day mortality such as older patients, chronic respiratory disease or immune deficiency, septic shock or higher SOFA score or cardiac diseases, organ dysfunction within 2 days before ICU-BSI, transfer from another ward, nutrition, intravenous or urinary tract catheters within a week before, and/or do-not-resuscitation order. In our study, mortality at 28 days was 20.6% in the general population and 15.7% in patients with ESBL-PE carriage. It was 19.4% in ESBL-PE carriers with ICU-BSI caused by ESBL-PE versus 14.1% in ESBL-PE carriers with ICU-BSI caused by non–ESBL-PE (nonsignificant). Analysis of the impact of causative microorganism of ICU-BSI compared with S. aureus at 28-day mortality showed no difference between organisms. In multivariable analysis, factors independently associated with mortality at day 28 from the occurrence of ICU-BSI were of a traumatic category at admission (OR: 0.346; 95% CI: 0.134–0.894; P = 0.028), and septic shock associated with ICU-BSI (OR: 3.317; 95% CI: 1.561–7.050; P = 0.002). Indeed, septic shock is a severe condition associated with a high mortality rate reaching 40% in some cases. Regarding patients with trauma at admission, they are typically younger and in good health, placing them at a lower risk of mortality in ICU.

Question 13. How can you manage invasive candidiasis in surgical patients?

Statement 13.1. It is important the knowledge of the risk of developing invasive candidiasis, improve microbiological diagnostics and optimize treatment.

Invasive candidiasis (IC) has a significant impact on morbidity, mortality, length of hospital stay, and healthcare costs in critically ill patients. The overall mortality for these patients is high. Candidemia increases mortality rates in the range of 20–49%, and the attributable mortality has been calculated to be around 15%. The severity of illness (APACHE II score > 10, ventilator use for > 48 h), antibiotics, central venous lines, total parenteral nutrition, burns, and immunosuppression are the most common risk factors.

The risk factors for IC are so numerous that most patients could be considered as exhibiting risk factors for IC. But, the use of excessive antifungal agents would be associated with substantially increased overall healthcare costs and might lead to the emergence of resistance. Unfortunately, early diagnosis of IC remains a challenge, and criteria for starting empirical antifungal therapy in ICU patients are poorly defined. To both ensure appropriate and timely antifungal therapy and to avoid unnecessary use of antifungal agents, some authors have developed clinical prediction rules to identify patients at high risk of candidiasis and for whom initiation of empirical antifungal therapy could be justified. However, there are many concerns about these rules: high specificity but low sensitivity. In 2006, a Spanish group, using the database of the Estudio de Prevalencia de CANdidiasis project, identified four predictors of proven invasive Candida infection. Based on these predictors, a score named "Candida score" (CS) was built. In 2009, the same group demonstrated a significant linear association between increasing values of the CS and the rate of invasive Candida infections. The factors to predict IC were surgery, multifocal colonization, total parenteral nutrition, and severe sepsis. To each risk factor, 1 point was given, and for clinical sepsis, a score of 2 was given. The cutoff value of 2.5 had sensitivity of 81% and specificity of 74%. Although blood cultures are still considered the gold standard for diagnosis, it has been shown that they are negative in up to 50% of cases. Thus, non-culture diagnostic techniques based on serological biomarkers detecting fungal cell components and/or antibodies directed against these components have been investigated. All these diagnostic tests may diagnose IC earlier than clinical or culture-based measures.

### Candida urinary tract infections – epidemiology [^baaa4218]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Candiduria is rarely present in healthy individuals. In contrast, it is a common finding in hospitalized patients, especially those in intensive care units (ICUs) who often have multiple predisposing factors, including diabetes mellitus, indwelling urinary catheters, and exposure to antimicrobials. Candiduria occurs much less commonly in the community setting. In a majority of episodes in adult patients in critical care facilities candiduria represents colonization, and antifungal therapy is not required. However, the presence of yeast in the urine can be a sign of a disseminated infection. In the critically ill newborn, candiduria often reflects disseminated candidiasis and is accompanied by obstructing fungus ball formation in the urinary tract. In ICU patients, although candiduria is a marker for increased mortality, it is only rarely attributable to Candida urinary tract infection.

### Attributable mortality of candidemia-results from the ECMM Candida III multinational European observational cohort study [^82d67b6b]. The Journal of Infection (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Despite antifungal advancements, candidaemia still has a high mortality rate of up to 40%. The ECMM Candida III study in Europe investigated the changing epidemiology and outcomes of candidaemia for better understanding and management of these infections.

Methods

In this observational cohort study, participating hospitals enrolled the first ten consecutive adults with blood culture-proven candidemia. Collected data included patient demographics, risk factors, hospital stay duration (follow-up of 90 days), diagnostic procedures, causative Candida spp., management details, and outcome. Controls were included in a 1:1 fashion from the same hospitals. The matching process ensured similarity in age (10-year range), primary underlying disease, hospitalization in intensive care versus non-ICU ward, and major surgery within 2 weeks before candidemia between cases and controls. Overall and attributable mortality were described, and a survival probability for cases and controls was performed.

Results

One hundred seventy-one pairs consisting of patients with candidemia and matched controls from 28 institutions were included. In those with candidemia, overall mortality was 40.4%. Attributable mortality was 18.1% overall but differed between causative Candida species (7.7% for Candida albicans, 23.7% for Candida glabrata/Nakaseomyces glabratus, 7.7% for Candida parapsilosis and 63.6% for Candida tropicalis). Regarding risk factors, the presence of a central venous catheter, total parenteral nutrition and acute or chronic renal disease were significantly more common in cases versus controls. Duration of hospitalization, and especially that of ICU stay, was significantly longer in candidemia cases (20 (IQR 10–33) vs 15 days (IQR 7–28); p = 0.004).

Conclusions

Although overall and attributable mortality in this subgroup analysis of matched case/control pairs remains high, the attributable mortality appears to have decreased in comparison to historical cohorts. This decrease may be driven by improved prognosis of Candida albicans and Candida parapsilosis candidemia; whereas candidemia due to other Candida spp. exhibits a much higher attributable mortality.

Viral and fungal sepsis — initial antimicrobial considerations in the emergency department (ED) include that viral infections, such as influenza and SARS‑CoV‑2, can cause sepsis, and antiviral therapy can be initiated in the ED, although no timing threshold data exist. Fungi can trigger sepsis and the most common cause of fungal sepsis is Candida; in patients at high risk of fungal sepsis, antifungal therapy with activity for likely pathogens should be initiated in the ED. Risk factors for invasive Candida infection include prior invasive Candida infection, current Candida colonization, total parenteral nutrition, recent major abdominal surgery, recent exposure to broad‑spectrum antibiotics, recent prolonged hospitalization, acute necrotizing pancreatitis, neutropenia, chronic corticosteroid use, and chronic indwelling vascular catheters.

Results

In total, 341 (76%) of 451 patients receiving HPN were included in the analyses (Figure S1). Of these, 42 (12%) patients experienced 1 or more candidemia episodes (range 1–6). Baseline characteristics of patients are shown in Table 1. The median follow‐up time of patients without candidemia was 3.5 years (IQR 1.6–7.1) and for candidemia patients 5.3 years (IQR 2.3–8.0). In total, 63 candidemia episodes and 572 non‐ Candida ‐related CLABSIs occurred during 673,278 catheter days. The overall candidemia rate was 0.09 infections per 1000 catheter days (95% CI 0.07–0.12). The median time to first candidemia was 227 days (IQR 43–927). Eighteen (29%) candidemia developed within 30 days following a CLABSI. In total, 28 (44%) candidemia developed while the patient received broad‐spectrum antibiotics. Of the 42 patients with a candidemia, 17 (40%) had a surgical intervention within 30 days before the initial candidemia diagnosis. Of these, 16 had a venous access device replacement and 1 underwent major abdominal surgery. Five (12%) patients had been admitted to the intensive care unit within 30 days prior to candidemia diagnosis. Eventually, 2 (5%) patients died within 30 days after the candidemia diagnosis. Cultured Candida species are shown in Table 1.

### Persistent candidemia caused by different Candida species: data from a multicenter contemporary cohort [^075dd0e1]. The Journal of Infection (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To explore persistent candidemia by different Candida spp.

Methods

Observational, retrospective, multicenter study including patients with candidemia (Jan 2018-Dec 2022) from 3 hospitals in Italy and Spain. The primary outcome was persistent candidemia, defined as positive blood culture (BC) yielding the same Candida spp ≥ 5 days from the start of active antifungals. Patients with no available follow-up BCs were excluded. A competing risk analysis (competing risk of death) was performed using Fine and Gray regression models.

Results

Among 1188 patients, 298 (25.1%) had persistent candidemia. Cancer (sHR 1.335, 95% CI 1.037–1.633, p = 0.011), total parenteral nutrition (sHR 1.440, 95%CI 1.062–1.818, p = 0.006), Candida parapsilosis (sHR 1.312, 95% CI 1.075–1.633, p = 0.03) and Candida auris (sHR 1.549, 95% CI 1.155–2.159, p = 0.029) compared to Candida albicans, were associated with increased risk of persistent candidemia, whereas primary candidemia (sHR 0.573, 95% CI 0.321–0.825, p < 0.001) and early source control (sHR 0.557, 95% CI 0.401–0.713, p < 0.001) were protective. Persistent candidemia was associated with higher 30-day mortality (aHR 1.605, 95% CI 1.176–2.191, p = 0.003).

Conclusions

Persistent candidemia affects one in four patients with Candida BSI. Infections caused by Candida parapsilosis or Candida auris require individualized management, with early source control being essential to reduce the risk of persistence.

Important factors contributing to risk of invasive candidiasis in ICU include use of broad-spectrum antimicrobials, immunosuppressive drugs, and total parenteral nutrition alongside iatrogenic interventions which breach natural barriers to infection [vascular catheters, renal replacement therapy, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), surgery]. This review discusses three key challenges in this field. The first is the shift in Candida epidemiology across the globe to more resistant non-albicans species, in particular, the emergence of multi-resistant Candida glabrata and Candida auris, which pose significant treatment and infection control challenges in critical care. The second challenge lies in the timely and appropriate initiation and discontinuation of antifungal therapy. Early antifungal strategies (prophylaxis, empirical and pre-emptive) using tools such as the Candida colonisation index, clinical prediction rules and fungal non-culture-based tests have been developed: we review the evidence on implementation of these tools in critical care to aid clinical decision-making around the prescribing and cessation of antifungal therapy. The third challenge is selection of the most appropriate antifungal to use in critical care patients. While guidelines exist to aid choice, this heterogenous and complex patient group require a more tailored approach, particularly in cases of acute kidney injury, liver impairment and for patients supported by extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. We highlight key research priorities to overcome these challenges in the future.

Clinical Risk Factors for Candidemia

Univariable and multivariable Poisson regression analyses of clinical risk factors are shown in Table S4 and Table 4, respectively. Both intestinal dysmotility as underlying condition leading to IF, and the rate of non‐ Candida ‐related CLABSIs were univariably associated with candidemia. In a multivariable model, only a higher rate of non‐ Candida ‐related CLABSIs was associated with a higher risk for candidemia (rate ratio, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.14–1.46; P < 0.001).

### Neonatal candidiasis: diagnosis, prevention, and treatment [^c2038a94]. The Journal of Infection (2014). Low credibility.

Infection with Candida species is associated with significant morbidity and mortality in infants. The incidence of Candida infection varies widely across centers, likely due to differences in practice related to modifiable risk factors such as exposure to empiric antibiotics and length of parenteral nutrition. Early diagnosis of Candida and prompt treatment with appropriate antifungal agents, such as fluconazole, amphotericin B deoxycholate, and micafungin, are critical for improved outcomes. This paper reviews the current literature relating to the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of Candida infections in the neonatal intensive care unit.

### Risk factors for invasive fungal disease in critically ill adult patients: a systematic review [^654daabd]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Paphitou et al. developed and validated a number of clinical decision rules from a single-centre, retrospective cohort study of 327 critically ill patients comprising 9 cases of proven IFD and 27 probable or possible cases. Several combinations of risk factors were evaluated, of which any combination of diabetes mellitus, new-onset haemodialysis, use of total parenteral nutrition or receipt of broad-spectrum antibiotics was considered the most useful. The model had a sensitivity of 78% to 83% and specificity of approximately 50%.

Pittet et al. developed a number of clinical decision rules based on intensity of Candida colonisation from a single-centre, prospective cohort study of 29 critically ill patients with significant Candida colonisation, of whom 11 had severe Candida infection. The best-performing rule, developed post hoc to give perfect discrimination in the small data set, was a Candida corrected colonisation index (ratio of highly positive fungal screening samples to the total number of samples) of 0.4 or more.

Piarroux et al. evaluated the clinical decision rule developed by Pittet et al. whereby patients admitted to a single surgical intensive care unit were screened for fungal colonisation and preemptively treated with fluconazole if the Candida corrected colonisation index was 0.4 or more. On the basis of a review of same-centre historical controls from a time period prior to prophylaxis, a reduction of unit-acquired IFD from 2.2% to 0% (P < 0.001) was reported.

Reporting of methodological assessment

The included studies varied with respect to their methodological quality (Tables 5 and 6). All 12 studies reported objectives, main outcomes and characteristics of the selected study patients (Table 5). The majority of the studies were carried out in at least two critical care units. The analysis was defined a priori in ten (83%) of the twelve studies, and the majority of known risk factors were accounted for in ten (91%) of the eleven studies in which multivariable analyses were conducted. The study by Piarroux et al. evaluated a clinical decision rule and therefore did not carry out a risk factor analysis. Risk factors were poorly defined in over half of the studies, and a rationale for inclusion was missing in over two-thirds of the studies.

Unadjusted Risk Factors

Twenty-nine risk factors were extracted from the selected publications. The results for all risk factors except ICU length of stay (e-Fig 7) are presented in Figure 2 (e-Fig 8). The risk factors associated with the highest risk for ICI were broad-spectrum antibiotics (OR, 5.6; 95% CI, 3.6–8.8), blood transfusion (OR, 4.9; 95% CI, 1.5–16.3), Candida colonization (OR, 4.7; 95% CI, 1.6–14.3), central venous catheter (OR, 4.7; 95% CI, 2.7–8.1), and total parenteral nutrition (OR, 4.6; 95% CI, 3.3–6.3). ICU length of stay, assessed by four studies, was an outlier with an extremely high risk (OR, 17.3; 95% CI, 4.1–73.0). Meta-analyses, differing definitions, funnel plots, and cumulative meta-analyses for individual risk factors are presented in e-Figures 9–85.

The associations (and lack of associations) of the continuous variables with the risk of ICI were consistent with the findings from the pooled ORs. Heterogeneity measured by I 2 showed a wide range (0%-96%), resulting in significant heterogeneity in 12 of 29 of the observed risk factors. Egger test showed a significant asymmetry of funnel plots only for central venous catheter (e-Fig 63). Cumulative meta-analyses revealed a relevant influence of less accurate studies only for bacteremia (e-Fig 55).

### TPN control needed… [^9992321e]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Total parenteral nutrition has been increasingly used since 1968. It is now an established method of maintaining normal nitrogen balance in patients who otherwise would be unable to do so. The use of all forms of intravenous infusion therapy has been largely responsible for the success in treating critically ill patients. In this issue of the Archives, Plouffe et al discuss an outbreak of infection caused by contamination of the system used in preparing infusion fluid. Although Candida albicans is the most common cause of fungemia complicating intravenous therapy, other species such as C parapsilosis have been isolated, and the clinical picture appears to be the same, regardless of which Candida species is responsible. 1 Patients receiving hyperalimentation who develop candidemia usually clear the fungus from the blood shortly after the infusion catheter has been removed.

### Initial antimicrobial management of sepsis [^f3cd268a]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

The approach to fungal sepsis

Invasive fungal infections (IFI) are rising as a cause of ICU sepsis and are associated with a mortality of 40% to 60%. Epidemiological data, risk factors, prediction rules, scores, microbiological data and biomarkers can help identify patients with fungal sepsis.

Fungi account for around 5% of all cases of sepsis. Candida, the main etiological agent, is the sixth to tenth most common agent of bloodstream infections and often presents as candidemia or deep-seated candidiasis. One-third of all candidemia occurs in the ICU and 25% to 35% of candidemic patients present with sepsis or septic shock. Pneumocystosis, cryptococcosis, histoplasmosis, invasive aspergillosis, mucormycosis, fusariosis, penicilliosis and scedosporiosis may occasionally also present with disseminated infection and sepsis.

Candida is a normal constituent of the microbiota of the skin, the gastrointestinal tract, the urethra and the vagina, making it difficult to distinguish colonization from infection when isolated from non-sterile body sites. As an opportunistic pathogen, Candida is unlikely to cause infections without either a profound alteration of the microbiota, the integrity of the skin or the mucous membranes, or of host defenses. In immunocompetent ventilated ICU patients, isolation of Candida from lower respiratory tract specimens nearly always indicates colonization rather than infection. A Candida colonization index of 0.5 or greater, defined as the ratio of positive to negative screening cultures of body sites, may increase the likelihood of invasive candidiasis, and may trigger preemptive or empiric therapy.

Risk factors for invasive candidiasis are non-specific and similar to bacterial infections, (prior colonization, broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy, intravenous access devices, parenteral nutrition, diabetes, renal insufficiency, hemodialysis, abdominal surgery, pancreatitis, neutropenia, solid organ transplantation and immunosuppressive therapy). Scoring systems based on combinations of risk factors, underlying conditions and clinical characteristics exhibit high (> 90%) negative predictive values for IFI and may assist in ruling out invasive candidiasis.

### Bench-to-bedside review: therapeutic management of invasive candidiasis in the intensive care unit [^32d0555c]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

Candida is one of the most frequent pathogens in bloodstream infections, and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The epidemiology of species responsible for invasive candidiasis, both at local and worldwide levels, has been changing - shifting from Candida albicans to non-albicans species, which can be resistant to fluconazole (Candida krusei and Candida glabrata) or difficult to eradicate because of biofilm production (Candida parapsilosis). Numerous intensive care unit patients have multiple risk factors for developing this infection, which include prolonged hospitalisation, use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, presence of intravascular catheters, parenteral nutrition, high Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation score, and so forth. Moreover, delaying the specific therapy was shown to further increase morbidity and mortality. To minimise the impact of this infection, several management strategies have been developed - prophylaxis, empirical therapy, pre-emptive therapy and culture-based treatment. Compared with prophylaxis, empirical and pre-emptive approaches allow one to reduce the exposure to antifungals by targeting only the patients at high risk of candidemia, without delaying therapy until the moment blood Candida is identified in blood cultures. The agents recommended for initial treatment of candidemia in critically ill patients include echinocandins and lipid formulation of amphotericin B.

Nonneutropenic candidemia — central venous catheter management: Central venous catheters (CVCs) should be removed as early as possible in the course of candidemia when the source is presumed to be the CVC and the catheter can be removed safely; this decision should be individualized for each patient (strong recommendation; moderate-quality evidence).

### The risk for bloodstream infections is associated with increased parenteral caloric intake in patients receiving parenteral nutrition [^58da4ce3]. Critical Care (2007). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Increased parenteral caloric intake is an independent risk factor for BSI in patients receiving TPN. This association appears unrelated to hyperglycemia. Based upon our observations, we suggest that parenteral caloric intake be prescribed judiciously and monitored closely, accounting for all intravenous caloric sources.

### Guidelines for the prevention of intravascular catheter-related infections: recommendations relevant to interventional radiology for venous catheter placement and maintenance [^0db46a15]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2012). Medium credibility.

Pathogenesis of catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI) includes four recognized contamination routes — skin organism migration along the catheter (most common for short-term catheters), direct contamination of catheter or hub, hematogenous seeding from another focus, and infusate contamination — and is influenced by device material, host factors (fibrin and fibronectin sheath), and organism virulence including extracellular polymeric substance with biofilm formation. Small-bore catheters are associated with higher colonization risk than polyurethane catheters, Candida albicans forms biofilm more readily on silicone elastomer than on polyurethane, and more thrombogenic materials might predispose to colonization and infection, prompting emphasis on preventing catheter-related thrombosis. Biofilm matrix enrichment by divalent cations facilitates embedding, and dextrose-containing fluids can promote Candida slime, potentially explaining increased fungal BSI among patients receiving parenteral nutrition.

### Risk factors for candidemia: a prospective matched case-control study [^7de92b47]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Candidemia is an opportunistic infection associated with high morbidity and mortality in patients hospitalized both inside and outside intensive care units (ICUs). Identification of patients at risk is crucial to ensure prompt antifungal therapy. We sought to assess risk factors for candidemia and death, both outside and inside ICUs.

Methods

This prospective multicenter matched case-control study involved six teaching hospitals in Switzerland and France. Cases were defined by positive blood cultures for Candida sp. Controls were matched to cases using the following criteria: age, hospitalization ward, hospitalization duration, and, when applicable, type of surgery. One to three controls were enrolled by case. Risk factors were analyzed by univariate and multivariate conditional regression models, as a basis for a new scoring system to predict candidemia.

Results

One hundred ninety-two candidemic patients and 411 matched controls were included. Forty-four percent of included patients were hospitalized in ICUs, and 56% were hospitalized outside ICUs. Independent risk factors for candidemia in the ICU population included total parenteral nutrition, acute kidney injury, heart disease, prior septic shock, and exposure to aminoglycoside antibiotics. Independent risk factors for candidemia in the non-ICU population included central venous catheter, total parenteral nutrition, and exposure to glycopeptides and nitroimidazoles. The accuracy of the scores based on these risk factors is better in the ICU than in the non-ICU population. Independent risk factors for death in candidemic patients included septic shock, acute kidney injury, and the number of antibiotics to which patients were exposed before candidemia.

Discussion

While this study shows a role for known and novel risk factors for candidemia, it specifically highlights important differences in their distribution according to the hospital setting (ICU versus non-ICU).

Conclusion

This study provides novel risk scores for candidemia accounting for the hospital setting and recent progress in patients' management strategies and fungal epidemiology.

### Notes from the field: fungal bloodstream infections associated with a compounded intravenous medication at an outpatient oncology clinic-new york city, 2016… [^adc5f608]. CDC (2019). Medium credibility.

Altmetric: Citations: Views: Views equals page views plus PDF downloads On May 24, 2016, the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene notified CDC of two cases of. Exophiala dermatitidis bloodstream infections among patients with malignancies who had received care from a single physician at an outpatient oncology facility. Review of January 1–May 31, 2016 microbiology records identified E. dermatitidis bloodstream infections in two additional patients who also had received care at clinic A. All four patients had implanted vascular access ports and had received intravenous medications, including a compounded IV flush solution containing saline, heparin, vancomycin, and ceftazidime, compounded and administered at clinic A. E. dermatitidis, two with Rhodotorula mucilaginosa, and two with both fungi. No cases were identified among patients who did not receive IV medications.

Five of the 17 cases were identified in symptomatic patients who sought medical care for infection or underlying medical conditions, and the remaining 12 were identified by screening blood or CVC culture. Two of the infected patients died at 10 days and 12 weeks after positive culture, respectively; it was unclear whether the deaths were related to the infections. The 17 patients with a positive culture did not share a common chemotherapeutic exposure or a common adjunctive IV therapy. However, all patients with or without a positive culture were exposed to the compounded IV flush solution. Patients with a positive culture received a median of 12 flushes during the study period compared with a median of four flushes for those with a negative culture.

Twenty-four of the 29 patients had a CVC, and five received IV medications through a peripheral line; all 17 patients with a positive culture had a CVC. After the screening blood culture was obtained, all patients with a CVC had their venous access removed and began 4–6 weeks of antifungal therapy. The five patients who received IV medications through a peripheral line had negative screening blood cultures, and antifungal treatment was not recommended.

Of the 27 studies that reported urinary bacterial isolates, Escherichia coli was the predominant isolate in 25 (93%) of them, whereas Klebsiella spp. was predominant in 2 (7%). Most common bacterial strains included gram negative coliforms, including Escherichia coli (100%), Klebsiella spp. (81%), Proteus spp. (41%), Pseudomonas spp. (33%), Enterobacter spp. (22%), and Citrobacter spp. (15%). Other reported gram-negative bacterial isolates include Salmonella spp. (7%), Serratia spp. (7%), Hafnia alvei (4%) and Morganella morganii (4%). Gram-positive isolates were less prevalent and included Staphylococcus spp. (7%), Enterococcus spp. (7%), and Streptococcus faecalis (4%) as well as the fungus, Candida albicans (4%). Antibiotic sensitivity tests were performed by 13 (38%) studies, with different sensitivity patterns (Table 5).

Comorbidities of UTI in malnourished children

The most commonly reported morbidities in malnourished children were diarrhea or gastroenteritis (53%; n = 18), respiratory diseases (including pneumonia, tuberculosis, respiratory tract infection and abnormal chest radiographs; 47%; n = 16) and bacteremia or sepsis (47%; n = 16). Six studies reported co-occurrence of UTI with at least one of these common malnutrition-associated morbidities. Only 27% (n = 7) of the cross-sectional studies on UTI in malnourished patients investigated renal urinary tract malformations in their UTI patients, reporting a combined malformation prevalence of 14% in these patients. In contrast, 75% (n = 6) of the case-control studies utilized radiological investigations to identify malformations as a risk factor for UTI in their patients, reporting a prevalence of 34% (n = 80) among the malnourished children and a prevalence of 4% (n = 4) among the healthy controls.

### Invasive candidiasis [^80f8a35c]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2018). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on invasive candidiasis:

- **Definition**: Invasive candidiasis refers to bloodstream infection (candidemia) caused by Candida species that can lead to deep-seated infections including intra-abdominal abscess, peritonitis, and osteomyelitis.
- **Pathophysiology**: Invasive candidiasis is most frequently caused by C. albicans. Candidemia pathways include long-term use of antibiotics, gastrointestinal and cutaneous perforation (chemotherapy, gastric surgery, venous catheters), and immunosuppressive medication.
- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of invasive candidiasis in the US is estimated at 8 per 100,000 population per year, with peak rates at the extremes of age. Half of all invasive candidiasis cases occur in the ICU setting.
- **Disease course**: Clinical manifestations include unexplained fever nonresponsive to antibacterial treatment. Complications of candidemia can lead to ocular involvement (choroiditis, retinitis, endophthalmitis, and blindness), abdominal cavity (abdominal abscess, pancreatitis, peritonitis), bone (osteomyelitis, spondylodiscitis), brain (brain abscess, meningoencephalitis), heart (endocarditis), kidneys (candiduria, pyelonephritis, pyonephrosis, renal abscess), liver and spleen (chronic disseminated candidiasis, focal abscess), and lung (focal abscess). The disease decreases the QoL.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Invasive candidiasis in the ICU setting is associated with a high mortality rate of 35–80%.

Statement 16

For adults with sepsis (multiple organ dysfunction syndrome) or shock due to hospital-acquired cIAIs, empiric antifungal therapy for Candida spp. should be considered, especially those with recent abdominal surgery or gastrointestinal anastomotic leak. Empiric antifungal therapy may be considered for high-risk patients with community-acquired infections (Low-quality evidence, Strong recommendation).

Intra-abdominal candidiasis is a rare but serious infection with a high mortality rate, especially of critically ill patients. The most common risk factors are GI perforation, anastomotic leak, and previous exposure to antifungal or antibacterial agents. The challenge of intra-abdominal candidiasis is related partly to the diagnostic difficulty of differentiating between contamination and infection when Candida spp. is isolated. Invasive intra-abdominal candidiasis (as opposed to contamination) requires aggressive antifungal treatment, even though adequate source control is the most important factor in improving outcomes of these patients. Unfortunately, early diagnosis of intra-abdominal candidiasis remains a challenge. Numerous risk factors for intra-abdominal candidiasis have been identified. Some clinical prediction rules were developed and validated to identify ICU patients at high risk of intra-abdominal candidiasis. In 2006, a Spanish group, using the database of the Estudio de Prevalencia de CANdidiasis project, proposed the "Candida score" to identify patients with high risk of intra-abdominal candidiasis; this score was calculated as 1 × (total parenteral nutrition) + 1 × (surgery) + 1 × (multifocal Candida colonization) + 2 × (severe sepsis).

### Risk factors and clinical analysis of candidemia in very-low-birth-weight neonates [^ae4c72b0]. American Journal of Infection Control (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Candidemia is the third leading cause of morbidity and mortality in preterm or very-low-birth-weight infants. The incidence and risk factors of candidemia in this population are poorly known in western China.

Methods

A case-control retrospective study of candidemia was conducted from January 2012-November 2015 in the Liuzhou Maternity and Child Healthcare Hospital. Data were analyzed by univariate analysis and multivariate logistic regression.

Results

Forty-eight confirmed cases of candidemia were identified during the study period, indicating an incidence of 106.9 per 1,000 admissions of very-low-birth-weight infants. Candida albicans was the most common pathogen and was isolated in 39.6% of infants with candidemia. The mortality rate of the case group was 10.4% versus 2.1% in the control group (P = 0.128). The multivariable logistic regression model identified that carbapenem use (odds ratio [OR], 11.39; 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.28–39.54), total parenteral nutrition (OR, 10.16; 95% CI, 2.25–45.94), and prolonged hospitalization (OR, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.01–1.07) were all associated with the risk of developing neonatal candidemia.

Conclusion

Very-low-birth-weight infants are at a significantly high risk of developing candidemia. The local neonatal intensive care unit management teams should effectively focus on decreasing the overall use of carbapenems, improving catheter care, removing catheters early, and shortening hospitalizations to reduce the incidence of candidemia.

### Risk factors for invasive fungal disease in critically ill adult patients: a systematic review [^702d8be3]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Risk prediction models and clinical decision rules

Four of the studies developed a risk prediction model or clinical decision rule (Table 4), and one evaluated a clinical decision rule for IFD, all in the critical care setting. León et al. developed and validated a risk prediction model from which they derived a bedside scoring system to inform early antifungal treatment in nonneutropenic critically ill patients. The study comprised a prospective cohort of 1,699 patients, of whom 980 with colonisation or infection were included in the model development with 97 IFDs. Multifocal Candida colonisation, surgery directly prior to critical care unit admission, severe sepsis and total parenteral nutrition were included in the final risk prediction model. The optimal score from the model gave a sensitivity of 81% and a specificity of 74%.

Table 4
Studies developing risk models or clinical decision rules

AUC = area under the receiver operating characteristic curve; CVC = central venous catheter; IFD = invasive fungal disease; NA = not applicable; NNT = number needed to treat to prevent one case; NPV = negative predictive value; NR = not reported; PPV = positive predictive value; ROC = receiver operating characteristic curve; TPN = total parenteral nutrition.

Ostrosky-Zeichner et al. developed a number of clinical decision rules for IFD in the critical care setting. Their study was a retrospective chart review of 2,890 patients from 12 participating centres with 88 cases of IFD. Several clinical decision rules, with varying combinations of risk factors, were developed and tested. The best-performing rule consisted of the following risk factors: any systemic antibiotic, presence of a central venous catheter. In addition, their rule included at least two of the following risk factors: total parenteral nutrition, any dialysis, any major surgery, pancreatitis and use of steroids or other immunosuppressants. The sensitivity and specificity of the model were 34% and 90%, respectively.

### Clinical outcomes of patients treated for Candida auris infections in a multisite health system, Illinois, USA [^55cda1b6]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Table 2
Demographic and clinical characteristics of patients treated for Candida auris infections in a multisite health system, Illinois, USA*

*CA-UTI, catheter-associated urinary tract infection; CFU, colony forming units; CLABSI, catheter-associated urinary tract infection; CoNS, coagulase negative Staphylococci; CVA, cerebral vascular accident; DKA, diabetic ketoacidosis; DM, diabetes mellitus; ESRD, end-stage renal disease; HD, hemodialysis; I&D, incision and debridement; PEG, percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy; PICC, peripherally inserted central catheter; POA, present on admission; SNF, skilled nursing facility; TPN, total parenteral nutrition; trach, tracheotomy; vent, ventilator.

Patients were empirically treated with micafungin (11 [92%]) or fluconazole (1 [8%]). Of those patients empirically treated with micafungin, most were being treated for CLABSI (7 [64%]), followed by catheter-associated urinary tract infection (2 [18%]) and skin and skin structure infection (2 [18%]). For definitive treatment, patients received micafungin (9 [75%]), fluconazole (2 [17%]), or itraconazole (1 [8%]). Of those patients who received an azole as definitive treatment, all were being treated for BSIs. Treatment duration ranged from 5 to 26 days (mean 14 days). The only adverse event noted was an increase in aspartate aminotransferase from 25 to 91 U/L in 1 patient being treated with fluconazole. Fluconazole was continued, and the patient was discharged on fluconazole to complete their treatment course.

Ten (83%) patients met criteria for clinical success. No patients were found to have C. auris recurrence or infection-related readmission within 30 days of first positive culture. Two (17%) patients died within 30 days of first positive culture; both were being treated for CLABSIs.

### Candida colonization as a risk marker for invasive candidiasis in mixed medical-surgical intensive care units: development and evaluation of a simple, standard protocol [^b929ab13]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2015). Low credibility.

Colonization with Candida species is an independent risk factor for invasive candidiasis (IC), but the minimum and most practicable parameters for prediction of IC have not been optimized. We evaluated Candida colonization in a prospective cohort of 6,015 nonneutropenic, critically ill patients. Throat, perineum, and urine were sampled 72 h post-intensive care unit (ICU) admission and twice weekly until discharge or death. Specimens were cultured onto chromogenic agar, and a subset underwent molecular characterization. Sixty-three (86%) patients who developed IC were colonized prior to infection; 61 (97%) tested positive within the first two time points. The median time from colonization to IC was 7 days (range, 0 to 35). Colonization at any site was predictive of IC, with the risk of infection highest for urine colonization (relative risk [RR] = 2.25) but with the sensitivity highest (98%) for throat and/or perineum colonization. Colonization of ≥ 2 sites and heavy colonization of ≥ 1 site were significant independent risk factors for IC (RR = 2.25 and RR = 3.7, respectively), increasing specificity to 71% to 74% but decreasing sensitivity to 48% to 58%. Molecular testing would have prompted a resistance-driven decision to switch from fluconazole treatment in only 11% of patients infected with C. glabrata, based upon species-level identification alone. Positive predictive values (PPVs) were low (2% to 4%) and negative predictive values (NPVs) high (99% to 100%) regardless of which parameters were applied. In the Australian ICU setting, culture of throat and perineum within the first two time points after ICU admission captures 84% (61/73 patients) of subsequent IC cases. These optimized parameters, in combination with clinical risk factors, should strengthen development of a setting-specific risk-predictive model for IC.

### Epidemiology of intensive care unit-acquired urinary tract infections [^0142e705]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The development of urinary tract infections in critically ill adult patients is associated with considerable morbidity, prolonged hospitalization, and greater healthcare expenditures. We review the occurrence, microbiology, risk factors for acquisition, and outcomes associated with intensive care unit-acquired urinary tract infections.

Recent Findings

Reports from several countries indicate that nosocomial urinary tract infections frequently complicate the course of patients admitted to intensive care units. Virtually all patients who develop an intensive care unit-acquired urinary tract infection have indwelling urinary catheters; other factors associated with the development of these infections include increased duration of urinary catheterization, female sex, intensive care unit length of stay, and preceding systemic antimicrobial therapy. The most frequent pathogens include Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococci, and Candida albicans; both the species distribution and rates of resistance vary considerably among institutions and regions. Secondary bloodstream infections are uncommon. Although acquisition of an intensive care unit-acquired urinary tract infection has been associated with a prolongation of intensive care unit length of stay, higher cost, and a higher crude case fatality rate, they do not appear to independently increase the risk for death.

Summary

Urinary tract infection is a common complication of critical illness that is associated with increased patient morbidity but not mortality. There is a relative paucity of research on nosocomial urinary tract infection specifically acquired in the intensive care unit and further studies are needed to better define the epidemiology and management of these infections.

The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2016). Medium credibility.

Mechanical circulatory support device (MCSD) recipients — risk factors for fungal infection — Use of total parenteral nutrition was significantly associated with fungal ventricular assist device (VAD) infection on multivariate analysis; univariate factors included a greater number of invasive devices, longer operative time, a greater number of transfusions, post-operative need for hemodialysis, and abdominal surgery. Use of total parenteral nutrition and renal replacement therapy are also noted as risk factors for invasive candidiasis (IC), and other risk factors include prolonged use of antibiotics, central venous catheters, mechanical ventilation, severity of illness, immunosuppression, and neutropenia.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of candidiasis: 2016 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^72bd862a]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Candida urinary tract infection (UTI) — first-line antifungal therapy and the role of bladder irrigation are described as follows: Fluconazole is the drug of choice for treating Candida UTI. Flucytosine demonstrates good activity against many Candida species, with the exception of C. krusei, but treatment with flucytosine is limited by its toxicity and the development of resistance when it is used as a single agent. Amphotericin B (AmB) deoxycholate is active against most Candida species, although some C. krusei isolates are resistant; lipid formulations of AmB appear to not achieve urine concentrations that are adequate to treat UTI and should not be used. Irrigation of the bladder with AmB deoxycholate resolves candiduria in 80%–90% of patients, but recurrent candiduria within several weeks was very common; this approach is useful only for bladder infections and generally is discouraged, especially in patients who would not require an indwelling catheter for any other reason.

### Neonatal candidiasis: epidemiology, risk factors, and clinical judgment [^3490b80d]. Pediatrics (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

Invasive candidiasis is a leading cause of infection-related morbidity and mortality in extremely low birth weight (< 1000-g) infants. We quantified risk factors that predict infection in premature infants at high risk and compared clinical judgment with a prediction model of invasive candidiasis.

Methods

The study involved a prospective observational cohort of infants ≤ 1000 g birth weight at 19 centers of the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Neonatal Research Network. At each sepsis evaluation, clinical information was recorded, cultures were obtained, and clinicians prospectively recorded their estimate of the probability of invasive candidiasis. Two models were generated with invasive candidiasis as their outcome: (1) potentially modifiable risk factors; and (2) a clinical model at time of blood culture to predict candidiasis.

Results

Invasive candidiasis occurred in 137 of 1515 (9.0%) infants and was documented by positive culture from ≥ 1 of these sources: blood (n = 96); cerebrospinal fluid (n = 9); urine obtained by catheterization (n = 52); or other sterile body fluid (n = 10). Mortality rate was not different for infants who had positive blood culture compared with those with isolated positive urine culture. Incidence of candida varied from 2% to 28% at the 13 centers that enrolled ≥ 50 infants. Potentially modifiable risk factors included central catheter, broad-spectrum antibiotics (eg, third-generation cephalosporins), intravenous lipid emulsion, endotracheal tube, and antenatal antibiotics. The clinical prediction model had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.79 and was superior to clinician judgment (0.70) in predicting subsequent invasive candidiasis.

Conclusion

Previous antibiotics, presence of a central catheter or endotracheal tube, and center were strongly associated with invasive candidiasis. Modeling was more accurate in predicting invasive candidiasis than clinical judgment.

### Prediction of invasive candidal infection in critically ill patients with severe acute pancreatitis [^dfc14f1d]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Infections caused by fungal pathogens have increased in the last two decades with data from the USA between 1979 and 2000 demonstrating a 207% increase. In the Extended Prevalence of Infection in Intensive Care (EPIC II) study, candida was the fourth most common cause of infection in ICUs worldwide. Infections in Europe are less frequent; however, in the Sepsis Occurrence in Acutely Ill Patients (SOAP) study, candidal organisms still accounted for 17% of infections. Other data demonstrate that candidaemia in intensive care patients, however, has remained static or even decreased in recent years. Most cases are caused by Candida albicans, but there are numerous other species, and antifungal resistance spectrums of these vary.

Numerous risk factors have been identified for the development of C andida spp bloodstream infection. These include the presence of invasive lines, for example central venous catheters (CVCs), antibiotic therapy, acute kidney injury requiring renal replacement therapy (RRT), malignancy and neutropenia, previous abdominal surgery, total parenteral nutrition (TPN), long term hospitalisation and prior fungal colonisation.

Severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) has also been identified as a risk factor for candidal infection. Candidal infection has been identified as a cause of increased mortality in patients post-operatively and in the critically ill but its effect on the outcome of SAP has been disputed. A healthy pancreas is relatively resistant to fungal infection; however, pancreatic necrosis carries a disproportionately higher risk of infection with bacterial and fungal organisms. Prior use of antibiotics has been demonstrated to increase the risk of fungal infection. Prophylactic or empirical antifungal treatment has been advocated for high-risk surgical patients and demonstrated to prevent fungal infection in SAP patients. 'Prophylactic' antifungal treatment is defined as administration of antifungals to patients identified as having a particular diagnosis or particular factors that confer a high risk of subsequent fungal infection. 'Empirical' treatment is defined as antifungal therapy given to patients with clinical features of an inflammatory response consistent with infection but without microbiological confirmation. As delays in treatment are associated with increased mortality and fungal culture can take up to 72 hours, it would be desirable to identify patients at risk for invasive infection whilst minimising unnecessary treatment and reducing the risk of resistance through increases in non-albicans species.

### Parenteral lipid emulsion induces germination of Candida albicans and increases biofilm formation on medical catheter surfaces [^91d73e4a]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Background

The administration of parenteral nutrition, including lipid emulsion (LE), to patients via medical catheters is an unexplained risk factor for the development of candidemia. Germination and biofilm formation are recognized virulence determinants of Candida albicans. No studies have addressed the effect of LE on candidal biofilm production. In this study, we investigated the effect of LE on candidal germination and its ability to form biofilm on medical catheter material.

Methods

C. albicans strain SC-5314 was grown in standard growth medium in the presence or absence a commercially available LE. Biofilms grown on silicone-elastomer catheter discs in these media were compared for mass by dry weight measurements. Biofilm morphology was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy and confocal laser microscopy. The effect of LE on C. albicans germination and growth was evaluated microscopically and by determination of colony-forming units, respectively.

Results

Addition of LE to standard growth medium increased C. albicans biofilm production and resulted in observed changes in biofilm morphology and architecture. Furthermore, LE induced germination and supported the growth of C. albicans.

Conclusions

LE-inducible candidal virulence determinants, such as germination and enhanced biofilm production, may help to explain the increased risk of candidemia in patients receiving LE via medical catheters.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign: international guidelines for management of sepsis and septic shock 2021 [^9547fd82]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Surviving Sepsis Campaign — empiric antifungal therapy and fungal infection risk factors — We suggest using empiric antifungal therapy in patients at high risk of fungal infection, while we suggest avoiding this if the risk is low, and the decision to start empirical antifungal therapy depends on the type and number of risk factors along with the locale/local epidemiology of fungal infections. Examples of risk factors for Candida sepsis include Candida Colonization at Multiple Sites, Surrogate Markers Such as Serum Beta-D-Glucan Assay, Neutropenia, Immunosuppression, Severity of Illness (High APACHE score), Longer ICU Length of Stay, Central Venous Catheters and Other Intravascular Devices, Persons Who Inject Drugs, Total Parenteral Nutrition, Broad Spectrum Antibiotics, Gastrointestinal Tract Perforations and Anastomotic Leaks, Emergency Gastrointestinal or Hepatobiliary Surgery, Acute Renal Failure and Hemodialysis, Severe Thermal Injury, and Prior Surgery; risk factors for endemic yeast (Cryptococcus, Histoplasma, Blastomycosis, Coccidioidomycosis) include Antigen Markers Such as Cryptococcal, Histoplasma or Blastomyces assays, HIV Infection, Solid Organ Transplantation, High Dose Corticosteroid Therapy, Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Certain Biologic Response Modifiers, and Diabetes Mellitus; risk factors for invasive mold infection include Neutropenia, Surrogate Markers Such as Serum or Bronchoalveolar Lavage Galactomannan Assay, Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Solid Organ Transplantation, High Dose Corticosteroid Therapy, and Certain Biologic Response Modifiers.

### Risk factors for candidemia: a prospective matched case-control study [^86ac393a]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Overall, the study confirms the well-established risk factors for candidemia, such as total parenteral nutrition (the most robust one, which was identified in all studies), central venous catheter, septic shock, kidney failure, or renal replacement, as well previous exposure to antibiotics (without class specification). The study also highlights the specific risk factors for candidemia that emerge for the ICU and the non-ICU settings, as illustrated by specific patterns of antibiotic exposure, as well as clinical features or medical equipment. For instance, CVC was an independent risk factor for candidemia outside the ICU, probably reflecting its very frequent use (> 90% of patients) in ICU, making it non-discriminant for the determination of the risk of candidemia this setting. In contrast, septic shock was associated with candidemia solely inside the ICU, in accordance with the two studies by Léon et al. reflecting the fact that most patients with such complication are managed in this setting. The other clinical features associated with candidemia solely among ICU patients included heart failure and kidney injury which not previously reported in this setting.

One of the most striking findings of this study was the different patterns of antibiotic exposure associated with candidemia in ICU and non-ICU patients. Glycopeptides and nitroimidazoles were associated with candidemia only outside the ICU. The frequent use of these drugs in the ICU may explain the lack of association in this specific setting. This finding is consistent with a recent study in patients on internal medicine wards, in which glycopeptides were found to be an independent risk factor for candidemia. As intraabdominal bacterial infections were associated with candidemia in the ICU population in univariate analysis (but not in multivariate one), we have forced this variable in the multivariate models for the whole population and the non-ICU one to check for bias. The association between candidemia and glycopeptides/nitroimidazoles remains significant so that these classes of antibiotics can be considered as independent from intraabdominal bacterial infections. In contrast, aminoglycosides were an independent risk factor for candidemia solely in the ICU. These drugs may represent a supplementary risk factor for developing candidemia among ICU patients, who are exposed to multiple other classes of antibiotics (including drugs active against Gram-negative anaerobic bacteria) and/or to glycopeptide antibiotics. Because control matching was performed on a center basis, the associations with antibiotics are not likely to reflect any differences in center's antibiotic stewardship or empirical treatment strategies.

### When is parenteral nutrition appropriate? [^13485ddc]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2017). Medium credibility.

Parenteral nutrition (PN) process — Recommendation 12B states that regardless of care setting, policies and procedures for the PN process should include measures to reduce the risk of complications (eg, promote glycemic control, avoid overfeeding, provide meticulous management of vascular access devices) and should incorporate the best available evidence. Evidence cited notes standardization resulted in reductions in sepsis (less than 1%), electrolyte abnormalities (2.7%), and glucosuria (5%), and a survey found that Forty-six percent of responders reported adverse events directly related to PN that required intervention. Protocols to avoid adverse events have been associated with favorable PN outcomes, including a reduction in the incidence of sepsis from 15.5% to 5.1% in a community hospital after implementing PN procedures.

### Factors associated with candidemia caused by non-albicans Candida species versus Candida albicans in the intensive care unit [^a2f77038]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Candida albicans has been the most common cause of fungal bloodstream infections (BSIs) in intensive care units (ICUs); however, infections due to non-albicans Candida species have been increasing in prevalence. We examined factors associated with BSIs due to non-albicans Candida species, compared with C. albicans BSIs, in an ICU patient population.

Methods

For our case-comparator study, we identified consecutive adult ICU patients with BSIs due to non-albicans Candida species or C. albicans at 2 tertiary care hospitals during the period 1995–2005. Data collected included demographic characteristics, comorbidities, exposure to antibiotics and antifungals, and ICU-related factors, such as total parenteral nutrition, blood product transfusions, invasive procedures, central venous catheter use, hemodialysis, and mechanical ventilation. We built a multivariable logistic regression model that identified variables that differentiate BSIs due to non-albicans Candida species from BSIs due to C. albicans.

Results

There were 67 patients with BSIs due to non-albicans Candida species and 79 patients with C. albicans BSIs. Variables were adjusted for time at risk. In multivariable models, factors associated with an increased risk of BSIs due to non-albicans Candida species, compared with C. albicans BSIs, included fluconazole exposure (odds ratio, 11.6; 95% confidence interval, 2.28–58.8), central venous catheter exposure (odds ratio, 1.95; 95% confidence interval, 1.10–3.47), and mean number of antibiotics per day (odds ratio, 2.31; 95% confidence interval, 0.71–7.54). Total parenteral nutrition exposure was associated with a decreased risk (odds ratio, 0.16; 95% confidence interval, 0.05–0.47) of BSIs due to non-albicans Candida species, compared with C. albicans BSIs. Duration of stay in the ICU was not significantly different between the 2 groups. Specific antibiotics, such as vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam, were not independently associated with BSI due to non-albicans Candida species.

Conclusions

Receipt of fluconazole and central venous catheter exposure were associated with an increased risk of BSI due to non-albicans Candida species, and total parenteral nutrition was associated with a decreased risk of BSI due to non-albicans Candida species, compared with BSI due to C. albicans. Patients without characteristics of infection due to non-albicans Candida species might benefit from empirical antifungal therapy with fluconazole.

### The risk for bloodstream infections is associated with increased parenteral caloric intake in patients receiving parenteral nutrition [^27f16097]. Critical Care (2007). Low credibility.

Results

Description of study cohort

Demographic data for the entire cohort are presented in Table 1. A total of 78 patients developed one or more BSI. There were no differences in age, sex or admission diagnosis between patients with and without BSI. Malignancy, documented immune suppression or infection as the admission diagnosis was not associated with an increased risk for BSI. Diagnosis of BSI was a median of 7.5 days (3–14 days) after initiation of TPN. As expected, ICU admission was an important risk factor for BSI (odds ratio, 2.9; 95% confidence interval, 1.5–5.6) (P < 0.001). Figure 1 shows the predominant isolated organisms. Staphylococcal species were responsible for 48% of infections. Fungal infections (Candida albicans or Candida glabrata) occurred in 16% of cases.

### Candida in burns: risk factors and outcomes [^1de83519]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2010). Low credibility.

Sepsis due to Candida is an uncommon but a significant cause of death in burns patients. Colonization is common, but consensus guidelines for prophylaxis and empirical therapy do not specifically include this cohort. Our aim was to define predictive factors for candidaemia in a burns unit, to guide protocols for prevention and early treatment. We conducted a 10-year review (July 1998-December 2007) of patients admitted to the Victorian Adult Burns Service, Melbourne, Australia. Of 1929 patients admitted with acute burn injury, 143 had Candida isolated at any site, most commonly Candida albicans. There were 12 episodes of candidaemia. Prior colonization was an important risk factor for candidaemia, and the risk increased substantially with the number of colonized sites; indeed 43% of patients colonized at more than three sites (and not on antifungals) developed candidaemia. Other risk factors were higher total burn surface area, higher full-thickness surface area, prolonged admission, number and duration of intensive care unit admissions, number of visits to the operating theatre, alcohol as a contributing factor to burn, prior treatment with total parenteral nutrition, or certain antibiotics (ceftriaxone, vancomycin, amikacin, co-trimoxazole). The attributable mortality of candidaemia was 15% (n = 2). Initiation of antifungal therapy was often delayed. Our results support early empirical antifungal therapy in septic burns patients who are colonized, before the results of cultures become known. The role of prophylactic antifungals is less clear, but should be strongly considered for patients colonized at multiple sites.

### Risk factors for albicans and non-albicans candidemia in the intensive care unit [^35e21e38]. Critical Care Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine risk factors for bloodstream infections (BSI) with Candida non-albicans (C-NA) species and Candida albicans (CA) among critically ill patients.

Design

Case-control study.

Setting

Adult medical and surgical intensive care units (ICUs) at two university hospitals.

Patients

Consecutive patients with C-NA and CA BSIs from 1995–2005 formed the two case groups. Controls were patients without candidemia who were randomly selected in a ratio of 5:1 and matched by study hospital, ICU type (medical vs. surgical) and by ICU admission date within a 3-month period.

Interventions

Data collected included demographics, comorbidities, exposure to antibiotics and antifungals, and ICU factors such as total parenteral nutrition (TPN), blood product transfusions, invasive procedures, central venous catheters, hemodialysis, and mechanical ventilation. We built multivariable logistic regression models, which identified risk factors for C-NA or CA BSIs compared with controls. Variables were adjusted for time-at-risk.

Measurements and Main Results

There were 67 patients with C-NA BSIs, 79 patients with CA BSIs, and 780 controls. In multivariable models, factors associated with an increased risk of C-NA compared with controls included major pre-ICU operations [odds ratio; (95% confidence interval)] [2.12; (1.14–3.97)], gastrointestinal procedures [2.24; (1.49–3.38)], enteric bacteremia [3.43; (1.39–8.48)], number of hemodialysis days [6.20; (2.67–14.4)], TPN duration [2.87; (1.40–5.90)], and mean number of red blood cell transfusions [2.72; (1.33–5.58)]. Factors associated with an increased risk of CA BSIs compared to controls were very similar and included major ICU operations [1.26; (1.14–3.97)], enteric bacteremia [3.45; (1.38–8.63)], number of hemodialysis days [3.84; (1.75–8.40)], TPN duration [11.0; (5.52–21.7)] and mean number of red blood cell transfusions [1.97; (0.98–3.99)].

Conclusions

We found multiple common risk factors for both non-C. albicans and C. albicans BSIs, however we could not differentiate between these two groups based on clinical characteristics alone.

### The use of prophylactic fluconazole in immunocompetent high-risk surgical patients: a meta-analysis [^76a7dfb4]. Critical Care (2005). Low credibility.

Introduction

Fungi are an increasingly important cause of nosocomial infections in intensive care units (ICUs). Systemic fungal infections are difficult to diagnose and are associated with substantial morbidity, attributable mortality, prolonged hospital stay, and healthcare costs. Despite advances in medical technology and the development of new antifungal drugs, the crude and attributable mortality of candidaemia has remained unchanged in the past 20 years. Candida spp. remain the commonest type of fungal infections in the ICUs and candidaemia accounts for 15% of all nosocomial bloodstream infections in the United States, with similar trends being reported worldwide.

The use of prophylactic antifungal therapy in ICU is controversial, although evidence from observational studies suggests that antifungal prophylaxis is associated with a reduced risk of candidaemia. The risk factors associated with candidaemia are prevalent in high-risk or critically ill surgical patients, and these include the presence of a central venous catheter, acute renal failure, total parenteral nutrition, gastrointestinal perforation, and prior surgery. Antifungal prophylaxis appears more beneficial for non-neutropenic critically ill surgical patients than for critically ill medical patients.

An antifungal agent selected for prophylaxis should have an appropriate spectrum of activity, should be easily delivered, and should have few adverse events. Fluconazole appears suitable and its efficacy has been evaluated in several randomised controlled clinical trials involving high-risk surgical patients, with variable results. In addition to its antifungal activity, fluconazole has been demonstrated to bind to neutrophil surface receptors and to upregulate intracellular signalling pathways, leading to enhanced oxygen free radical release and chemotaxis in vitro. It has been postulated that this immunomodulation effect may explain, at least in part, the beneficial effect of fluconazole on clinical outcome in patients with gut perforation. We conducted a meta-analysis to investigate the effects of prophylactic fluconazole on the incidence of candidaemia and hospital mortality in immunocompetent high-risk surgical patients.

### Rezafungin (Rezzayo) [^1e1fb4bb]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

One hundred and ninety-nine patients in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population were randomized. The age range was 19–91 years, the gender distribution was 62% male and 38% female, and the race distribution was 61% White, 5% Black, 29% Asian, and 5% other races or not reported. The median duration of therapy was 14 days in the two treatment arms.

The modified ITT (mITT) population included 187 patients with a culture positive for Candida species within 4 days before randomization and who received at least one dose of study drug. The most frequent species isolated at baseline was C. albicans (42%), followed by C. glabrata (26%), C. tropicalis (20%), and C. parapsilosis (13%). The majority (70%) of patients had a diagnosis of candidemia only. The majority (93%) of patients were not neutropenic (ANC ≥ 500) and 84% had APACHE II scores less than 20. Risk factors for candidemia were: receipt of broad-spectrum antibacterial drugs (71%), presence of a central venous catheter (60%), major surgery (35%), diabetes mellitus (29%), active malignancy (25%), and total parenteral nutrition (20%). Mechanically ventilated patients were 24% (17% and 30% in the REZZAYO and caspofungin group, respectively).

Efficacy was assessed by all-cause mortality at Day 30. The number and percentage of patients in each treatment group who were alive and deceased/unknown survival status at Day 30 was determined in the mITT population. Additional efficacy outcomes were global cure (mycological eradication/presumed eradication, clinical cure, and radiological cure [for patients with documented IC by radiologic or other imaging findings at baseline]), mycological eradication/presumed eradication, and investigator's assessment of clinical cure. Results of the efficacy endpoints are shown in Table 4.

A multicenter, randomized, dose-finding, exploratory, double-blind study was conducted in subjects with candidemia and/or invasive candidiasis (Trial 2: NCT02734862). The primary objectives of this study were to evaluate safety and tolerability of rezafungin and overall success (mycological eradication and resolution of systemic signs attributable to candidemia and/IC) at Day 14. The study provides safety and supportive efficacy data.

### Contribution of Candida biomarkers and DNA detection for the diagnosis of invasive candidiasis in ICU patients with severe abdominal conditions [^8d74c672]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Risk factors for the development of Candida spp. colonization or infection included the following: central venous catheters, arterial catheters, total parenteral nutrition, mechanical ventilation, continuous renal replacement therapy (hemofiltration), treatment with corticosteroids (defined as intravenous administration of steroids for 5 days or more), and broad-spectrum antimicrobial treatment.

Once the patient was included in the study, the following data were recorded twice a week from the fourth day of ICU stay and for 3 weeks: surveillance cultures, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE II) score, Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, clinical situation assessment (presence or absence of sepsis, severe sepsis, or septic shock), and Candida score. Blood samples for the measurement of BDG, CAGTA, mannan-Ag, and mannan-Ab were drawn at the same time periods. In patients treated with empirical or directed systemic antifungal treatment (SAT), clinical and microbiological study controls were performed on days 0, +3, +7, and +14 from the beginning of SAT. In addition, blood cultures and samples for PCR detection of Candida DNA were also obtained. Patients were followed until ICU and/or hospital discharge, or death. The indication of SAT was decided by the primary clinician. Details of SAT including starting date, drug(s), doses and duration of treatment were registered.

### Catheter-associated candiduria: risk factors, medical interventions, and antifungal susceptibility [^ffbe696a]. American Journal of Infection Control (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Catheter-associated candiduria is a common clinical finding in hospitalized patients, especially in the intensive care unit. The objective of this study was to obtain demographic and clinical data regarding the prevalence of Candida spp in catheterized in-patients and the medical interventions provided to these patients in a northern Israeli hospital between 2011 and 2013.

Methods

Isolation and identification of microorganisms were performed on 1,408 urine culture samples 48 hours after catheter insertion. Antifungal Etest susceptibility tests were carried out on every Candida-positive urine sample. Demographic and clinical data were gathered to determine risk factors and medical interventions.

Results

Candiduria was detected in 146 catheterized in-patients out of the 1,408 patients included in this study. C albicans was detected in most cases (69.1%). Fever was observed in 52 (35.61%) patients, and leukocyturia was observed in 48 cases (32.87%). Diabetes mellitus was associated with C albicans candiduria. There were 93 patients (63.69%) who did not receive any medical intervention for their candiduria.

Conclusion

Candida is the second leading pathogen causing catheter-associated urinary tract infection or asymptomatic colonization, whereas previous studies showed Candida as the third leading pathogen. Clinical signs and symptoms, such as fever and laboratory tests, cannot distinguish between asymptomatic colonization and infection. Because the management of catheter-associated candiduria is still controversial, additional studies should be carried out.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of candidiasis: 2016 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^70d01917]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

ICU prophylaxis against invasive candidiasis — fluconazole regimen and indication: Fluconazole, 800-mg (12 mg/kg) loading dose, then 400 mg (6 mg/kg) daily, could be used in high-risk patients in adult ICUs with a high rate (> 5%) of invasive candidiasis (weak recommendation; moderate-quality evidence).

### A clinical predictive model of candidaemia by Candida auris in previously colonized critically ill patients [^4f8bfa42]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Candida auris is an emerging multidrug-resistant fungus that has been associated with nosocomial outbreaks with high rates of mortality and transmission. The aim of this study was to perform a retrospective cohort analysis of risk factors and to build a scoring method for estimating the risk of candidaemia in colonized critically ill patients.

Methods

We performed a retrospective observational cohort study of patients aged ≥ 15 years colonized by C. auris in the 3-year period between March 2016 and March 2019. Epidemiological, clinical, laboratory and microbiological data were collected. We developed a predictive model for candidaemia using elastic net multivariable logistic regression techniques, assessed its discriminative capacity, and internally validated it using bootstrap resampling.

Results

Two-hundred and six patients were enrolled in the cohort for derivation and internal validation. Thirty-seven out of 206 patients developed candidaemia. Total parenteral nutrition was the foremost risk factor (adjusted OR 3.73); previous surgery (adjusted OR 1.03), sepsis (adjusted OR 1.75), previous exposure to antifungal agents (adjusted OR 1.17), arterial catheters (adjusted OR 1.46), central venous catheters (adjusted OR 1.21), presence of advanced chronic kidney disease (adjusted OR 1.35) and multifocal colonization (adjusted OR of unifocal colonization 0.46) were proven to be independent predictors of candidaemia in our cohort. The corresponding area under the curve (AUC) of the elastic net regularized predictive model was 0.89 (95%CI 0.826; 0.951). After performing the internal validation by generating 500 bootstrap replications, the model still showed great accuracy, with a resulting AUC of 0.84.

Conclusion

Our study provides evidence on the independent predisposing factors for candidaemia. It may help predict its estimated risk and may identify a high-risk population that could benefit from early or prophylactic antifungal treatment after external validation in other cohorts.

### Candida septicemia in a pregnant woman with hyperemesis receiving parenteral nutrition [^c05d4daa]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Intravascular catheter placement carries the risk of a life-threatening systemic fungal infection. In addition to antifungal therapy, removal of the catheter is often considered to be an important part of management.

Case

A 33-year-old multipara with hyperemesis underwent placement of a peripherally inserted central catheter for parenteral nutrition. She subsequently developed candidemia with both blood and the peripherally inserted central catheter tip cultures positive for Candida parapsilosis. The catheter was removed, the patient was started on intravenous amphotericin B, and due to side effects, she was switched to intravenous fluconazole. She recovered fully, was discharged home on oral fluconazole, and delivered a healthy infant at term.

Conclusion

Peripherally inserted central catheter placement may be complicated by candidemia. Intravenous fluconazole and removal of the contaminated catheter successfully eradicated systemic infection with C parapsilosis.

### Treatment of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis and preventive and empirical therapy for invasive candidiasis in adult pulmonary and critical care patients. An of ﬁ cial American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^ba871ee9]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Candida species are frequent colonizers of mucosal and cutaneous surfaces of healthy individuals; however, when there is breakdown of mechanical or immunologic defenses, invasion can occur. This may manifest as deep-seated IC and/or candidemia, and the latter can lead to metastatic complications, including but not limited to endophthalmitis, bone and joint infections, endovascular infections, and hepatosplenic abscesses. In critically ill patients, the incidence of candidemia varies from 3.5 to 16.5 episodes per 1,000 ICU admissions; however, the incidence of deep-seated IC without concomitant candidemia is less clear because of challenges associated with confirming the diagnosis. Outcomes associated with IC are poor with a crude mortality of 40–55%. Host risk factors for IC in critically ill patients include diabetes, systemic immunosuppression, organ failure, total parenteral nutrition, malignancy, Candida colonization, and genetic polymorphisms. Clinical risk factors encompass breaches in barrier of defense because of surgery, loss of mucosal integrity (e.g. of an abdominal viscus), burns, indwelling vascular access catheters, and hemodialysis.

Candida colonization logically precedes infection, and in critically ill patients, the presence and density of Candida colonization is predictive of development of IC. Deep-seated IC, particularly intraabdominal IC, occurs in critically ill patients and, because of limitations of available diagnostics, is likely underdiagnosed. Nonetheless, IC complicates a minority of ICU admissions. The use of antifungal therapy in the ICU, whether as prophylaxis or empiric therapy, is of great interest to providers treating critically ill patients. To our knowledge, no clear recommendations on the subject have been published.

### Comparison of albicans vs. non-albicans candidemia in French intensive care units [^309d02b4]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

Three other studies were performed exclusively in ICU. In Australia Playford et al. carried out a three-year prospective, national survey. A total of 179 episodes of candidemia were studied, of which 62% were related to C. albicans. Factors associated independently with a candidemia not related to C. albicans were recent intra-abdominal surgery and recent exposition to systemic antifungal therapy. Chow et al. compared 79 patients with candidemia due to C. albicans and 67 patients with candidemia due to non- albicans Candida species. Previous exposition to azole agents, duration of central venous catheter implantation and the number of antimicrobial agents per day were associated with non- albicans Candida infection in multivariate analyses. Conversely, the duration of parenteral nutrition was associated with a reduced risk of non- albicans Candida infection. Finally, 189 candidemic patients (C. albicans: 56%) were included in the international, multicenter, retrospective study of Holley et al. Factors associated independently with candidemia due to non- albicans Candida species were female gender and duration of central venous catheter implantation using multivariate analysis.

### Epidemiologic and molecular characterization of an outbreak of Candida parapsilosis bloodstream infections in a community hospital [^fa01c82d]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2004). Low credibility.

Candida parapsilosis is an important cause of bloodstream infections in the health care setting. We investigated a large C. parapsilosis outbreak occurring in a community hospital and conducted a case-control study to determine the risk factors for infection. We identified 22 cases of bloodstream infection with C. parapsilosis: 15 confirmed and 7 possible. The factors associated with an increased risk of infection included hospitalization in the intensive care unit (adjusted odds ratio, 16.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.8 to 148.1) and receipt of total parenteral nutrition (adjusted odds ratio, 9.2; 95% confidence interval, 0.9 to 98.1). Samples for surveillance cultures were obtained from health care worker hands, central venous catheter insertion sites, and medical devices. Twenty-six percent of the health care workers surveyed demonstrated hand colonization with C. parapsilosis, and one hand isolate was highly related to all case-patient isolates by tests with the DNA probe Cp3-13. Outbreak strain isolates also demonstrated reduced susceptibilities to fluconazole and voriconazole. This largest known reported outbreak of C. parapsilosis bloodstream infections in adults resulted from an interplay of host, environment, and pathogen factors. Recommendations for control measures focused on improving hand hygiene compliance.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of candidiasis: 2016 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^83084132]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Empiric therapy for suspected invasive candidiasis in nonneutropenic intensive care unit patients: Empiric antifungal therapy should be considered in critically ill patients with risk factors for invasive candidiasis and no other known cause of fever and should be based on clinical assessment of risk factors, surrogate markers for invasive candidiasis, and/or culture data from nonsterile sites (strong recommendation; moderate-quality evidence). Empiric antifungal therapy should be started as soon as possible in patients who have the above risk factors and who have clinical signs of septic shock (strong recommendation; moderate-quality evidence).

### When is parenteral nutrition appropriate? [^b91d1070]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2017). Medium credibility.

Parenteral nutrition (PN) complications — therapy-related clinical complications have been categorized as mechanical (eg, air embolus), infectious (eg, sepsis), metabolic (eg, electrolyte imbalance), and nutritional (eg, imbalance of macronutrients). A hospital survey reported the presence of several complications: "catheter placement complications (12%), glucosuria (42%), dehydration (5%), fluid and electrolyte abnormalities (28%), and fevers not traced to a source other than PN (42%)".

### Prevention and treatment of Candida infections in neonates [^3b849df8]. Seminars in Perinatology (2007). Low credibility.

Invasive Candia infections have become the third most common cause of late-onset infection among very low birth weight infants in most neonatal intensive care units. Significant risk factors include birth weight less than 1000 g, exposure to more than two antibiotics, third generation cephalosporin exposure, parenteral nutrition including lipid emulsion, central venous catheter, and abdominal surgery. The majority of neonatal Candida infections are caused by C. albicans and C. parapsilosis, although other nonalbicans species are being reported more frequently. Standard therapy has been amphotericin B; however, successful use of fluconazole as a single agent has also been reported and a small comparison trial demonstrated similar efficacy. The addition of new antifungal agents, including voriconazole and the echinocandins may further improve our ability to effectively treat these infections and possibly reduce the development of complications. Antifungal chemoprophylaxis has been studied in single-center and cohort studies, primarily using fluconazole. Although it is clear that fluconazole prophylaxis decreases the risk of fungal colonization and infection, identification of potential harm, particularly the development of or selection for resistant strains, requires further investigation with multicenter trials before widespread use is recommended outside of the clinical trial setting.

### A randomized, placebo-controlled trial of preemptive antifungal therapy for the prevention of invasive candidiasis following gastrointestinal surgery for intra-abdominal infections [^f2ce179b]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Candida species are the most common fungal pathogens in the intensive care unit (ICU), and invasive candidiasis (IC) is associated with considerable morbidity and mortality in critically ill patients. Early antifungal treatment reduces mortality rates in patients with documented IC, but a swift definitive diagnosis is difficult. Although prophylaxis or preemptive treatment strategies should be used in patients at high risk for IC, their identification is clinically challenging, because preemptive intervention markers have not been fully defined.

Risk factors for IC in critically ill patients include broad-spectrum antibiotic exposure, cancer chemotherapy, fungal colonization, indwelling vascular catheters, total parenteral nutrition, surgery, renal failure, hemodialysis, and prolonged ICU stay. Although these factors can be present in patients who do not have IC and individually are not sufficiently discriminatory, together they can still be used to identify high-risk patients. Risk identification strategies, such as Candida colonization index, clinical predictive rules and a Candida score have been proposed to aid in deciding when to initiate early antifungal therapy.

Antifungal prophylaxis in patients at high risk for IC has been investigated in several randomized, controlled trials. Trials in homogenous populations, such as surgical patients with recurrent gastrointestinal perforations or anastomotic leakages and severe acute pancreatitis, showed prophylaxis to be an effective strategy, because infection rates were high with placebo and significantly lower with active antifungal therapy. Studies with heterogeneous ICU patients, however had low incidences of infections in the placebo arms, and treatment differences between placebo and active therapy were not shown. Therefore, antifungal prophylaxis should be used only in specific subgroups where there is clear evidence of benefit. For the majority of ICU patients at high IC risk, a preemptive antifungal strategy, based on clinical risk factors and microbiologic evidence of substantial colonization, is proposed.

Patients requiring ICU management after emergency surgery for intra-abdominal infection have a high IC risk. As a commensal of the digestive tract, Candida may leak into the peritoneal cavity after perforation or during surgical resection of the intestine. Peritoneal seeding can result in intra-abdominal Candida infection with risk of dissemination to the bloodstream and extra-abdominal tissue and organs. The INTENSE (Invasive Candidiasis – Pre-emptive Treatment in High Risk Surgical Subjects) study assessed the strategy of preemptive antifungal therapy versus placebo in hospitalized patients requiring surgery for intra-abdominal infection. Micafungin was used as the active therapy, and the efficacy and safety of its use in that setting was assessed.
