## Question

What is a short RP narrow-complex tachycardia?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what a short RP narrow-complex tachycardia is, with a definition and explanation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the foundational ECG definitions of "narrow-complex tachycardia" and how RP and PR intervals are used in classification. Then, I should verify which mechanisms classically produce a short RP pattern and what ECG markers help identify them. Next, I will contrast short RP with long RP tachycardias to avoid overgeneralization. After that, I need to consider the practical diagnostic and acute management implications in emergency settings. Finally, I will synthesize a careful, reference-supported definition, and I should double-check any numeric thresholds before committing to them.

> Let me first confirm the base definition: a narrow-complex tachycardia is a regular rhythm faster than 100 beats per minute with QRS duration less than 120 ms, implying ventricular activation through the His-Purkinje system rather than direct myocardial spread, and the common mechanisms include AVNRT, AVRT, and atrial tachycardias, which are frequently encountered in ED practice and in electrophysiology workflows.

> I need to clarify the RP interval concept before applying it, because mislabeling short versus long RP leads to diagnostic errors; the RP interval is measured from the onset of the QRS (R) to the subsequent P-wave onset, and tachycardias can be grouped by the relationship between RP and PR, with "short RP" indicating RP shorter than PR and "long RP" indicating RP longer than PR, which frames the classification used at the bedside and in the EP lab [^1159NEjp].

> Hold on, let me verify which arrhythmias truly produce a short RP pattern on ECG; prototypically, slow-fast (typical) AVNRT has a decreased RP interval with retrograde P waves often buried within or immediately after the QRS, sometimes seen as a pseudo-R′ in V1 or pseudo-S waves in the inferior leads, and orthodromic AVRT can also manifest a decreased RP interval depending on retrograde conduction properties of the accessory pathway, so both mechanisms can yield "short RP" narrow-complex tachycardias in practice [^111zeXpf] [^111pLKeo].

> Let me think about mechanisms more granularly because the pathway determines the timing of atrial activation; in typical AVNRT, near-simultaneous activation of atria and ventricles through dual AV nodal physiology shortens the VA/RP interval, burying the P wave in or just after the QRS, whereas in orthodromic AVRT with a rapidly conducting retrograde accessory pathway, the ventriculoatrial conduction is brisk enough to keep RP shorter than PR, and epidemiologically AVNRT and AVRT together account for the bulk of SVT presentations, aligning with what is seen in general cardiology and aeromedical cohorts [^1159NEjp] [^115TT3D7].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought to define a short RP tachycardia with a numeric threshold like "RP typically < 100 ms", but I should double-check that because fixed cutoffs are not consistently endorsed; in fact, long VA interval analyses sometimes use > 100 ms to stratify mechanisms, but for short RP the more reliable and generalizable criterion is RP < PR with visual clues of retrograde atrial activation closely following the QRS rather than a universal millisecond threshold, so I will correct that tendency and anchor the definition to the RP-PR relationship and characteristic ECG signs rather than a hard number [^117Ek85U] [^1159NEjp].

> To ensure I'm not conflating categories, I should contrast with long RP tachycardias; atypical AVNRT (fast-slow), some orthodromic AVRTs with slowly conducting retrograde pathways, and atrial tachycardias can show long RP where the P waves are clearly separated from the QRS, as illustrated in reports of narrow complex, long RP tachycardias and EP case discussions that rely on VA intervals and pacing responses to distinguish mechanisms, which reinforces why "short RP" means early retrograde atrial activation relative to ventricular depolarization [^113PeGyy] [^117RXNtQ] [^1159NEjp].

> Next, I should review key bedside ECG clues because rapid pattern recognition guides acute management; in short RP tachycardias, P waves may be hidden within the QRS or appear immediately after as pseudo-R′ in V1 or pseudo-S in II, III, aVF, and when atrial and ventricular contraction are nearly simultaneous, regular "cannon A waves" in the neck can support an AVNRT diagnosis at the bedside, though I need to remember that neck venous pulsations are supportive rather than definitive and should be integrated with the ECG [^111zeXpf] [^114Wpgyf].

> I will now examine practical diagnostic steps in the ED or clinic because confirming mechanism affects treatment; obtaining a 12-lead ECG during tachycardia is guideline-recommended, and in difficult cases increasing ECG paper speed to 50 mm/s can help unmask retrograde P waves and refine RP measurements, while maintaining a differential that includes sinus tachycardia and atrial arrhythmias until the ECG features firmly support a reentrant SVT mechanism [^1158nKcM] [^112y8io3] [^112AUQWr].

> I need to ensure acute management aligns with guideline-based care; for hemodynamically stable, regular narrow-complex SVTs with a short RP pattern, vagal maneuvers are first-line, adenosine is recommended for acute termination, and if needed, rate-slowing agents such as IV beta-blockers or nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers are reasonable in appropriate patients, while remaining cautious in scenarios of preexcitation or diagnostic uncertainty, and synchronised cardioversion remains indicated for instability or refractory cases [^112mu1gm] [^113TZxcd] [^112CNJY9] [^112DCFhD] [^1158nKcM].

> Let me consider definitive therapy and confirm best practice; electrophysiology study with the option for ablation is guideline-endorsed for diagnosis and durable treatment of SVT, permitting precise mechanism identification through VA interval assessment and pacing maneuvers, with high success rates for ablation of typical AVNRT and orthodromic AVRT, which is especially important when episodes are recurrent, symptomatic, or drug-refractory [^114WF76M] [^1159NEjp].

> Synthesis time, but I will double-check that I have not reintroduced the discarded numeric cutoff; a short RP narrow-complex tachycardia is a regular supraventricular tachycardia with QRS duration less than 120 ms in which the RP interval is shorter than the PR interval, reflecting retrograde atrial activation that occurs immediately after or is buried within the QRS, most commonly due to typical AV nodal reentrant tachycardia or orthodromic AV reentrant tachycardia with rapid retrograde pathway conduction; hallmark ECG features can include absent or retrograde P waves closely following the QRS with pseudo-R′ in V1 or pseudo-S in inferior leads, and EP testing typically reveals very short VA intervals consistent with near-simultaneous atrioventricular activation in AVNRT or brisk retrograde conduction in AVRT, guiding both acute therapy and definitive ablation strategies [^111zeXpf] [^111pLKeo] [^1159NEjp].

Short RP narrow complex tachycardia is a regular SVT with a **short RP interval** (RP < PR) [^111pLKeo] and a narrow QRS (< 120 ms), most often due to AVNRT or orthodromic AVRT [^111zeXpf]. Diagnosis relies on ECG features (P waves buried in QRS or shortly after, pseudo-R' in V1, pseudo-S in inferior leads) [^111zeXpf] and response to vagal maneuvers or adenosine, which typically terminate AVNRT/AVRT [^112mu1gm] [^113TZxcd]. Acute management is **vagal maneuvers, adenosine**, or IV beta-blockers/calcium channel blockers if stable [^112CNJY9] [^112DCFhD]; synchronized cardioversion if unstable [^112mu1gm]. Catheter ablation is first-line definitive therapy for recurrent or drug-refractory cases [^114WF76M].

This case, which presented a frequent transition between left atrial tachycardia and AV nodal re-entrant tachycardia, has never been reported. The case underscores the importance of careful interpretation of intracardiac electrocardiograms and suggests that differential pacing maneuvers are not feasible in transitional tachycardia with atrial fusion.

### Differences in ventriculoatrial intervals during entrainment and tachycardia: A simpler method for distinguishing paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia with long ventriculoatrial intervals [^117Ek85U]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2011). Low credibility.

The usefulness of the interval between the last pacing stimulus and the last entrained atrial electrogram (SA) minus the tachycardia ventriculoatrial (VA) interval in the differential diagnosis of supraventricular tachycardias with long (> 100 ms) VA intervals has not been prospectively studied in a large series of patients. Our objective was to assess the usefulness of the difference SA-VA in diagnosing the mechanism of those tachycardias in patients without preexcitation. The results were compared with those obtained using the corrected return cycle (postpacing interval-tachycardia cycle length-atrioventricular [AV] nodal delay).

- **Methods and results**: We included 314 consecutive patients with inducible sustained supraventricular tachycardias with VA intervals > 100 ms undergoing an electrophysiologic study. Atrial tachycardias were excluded. Tachycardia entrainment was attempted through pacing trains from the right ventricular apex. The SA-VA difference and the corrected return cycle were calculated for every patient. Electrophysiologic study revealed 82 atypical AV nodal reentrant tachycardias (AVNRT) and 237 AV reentrant tachycardias (AVRT) using septal (n = 91) or free-wall (n = 146) accessory pathways (APs). A SA-VA difference > 110 ms identified an atypical AVNRT with sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of 99%, 98%, 95%, and 99.5%, respectively. Similarly, these values were 88%, 83%, 77%, and 92% for SA-VA difference < 50 ms in identifying AVRT through a septal versus free-wall AP. The SA-VA difference showed higher accuracy in septal.

### Wide complex tachycardia differentiation: A reappraisal of the state-of-the-art [^115zqyc8]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

Wide complex tachycardia (WCT) is a general term that broadly denotes the presence of ventricular tachycardia (VT) or supraventricular WCT (SWCT). Clinicians encountering patients with a WCT must consider a broad variety of attributable causes including VT, SWCT with preexisting or functional aberrancy, SWCT developing from impulse propagation using atrioventricular accessory pathways (i.e. preexcitation), rapid ventricular pacing, and tachyarrhythmias coinciding with toxic‐metabolic QRS duration widening (e.g. hyperkalemia or antiarrhythmic drug toxicity). The most critical task for the clinician is to determine whether the tachyarrhythmia has a ventricular or supraventricular origin, as accurate discrimination of VT and SWCT is vital for immediate patient care decisions, ensuing clinical workup, and long‐term management strategies. Proper patient management heavily relies on whether clinicians are equipped with and appropriately apply effective and reliable means to distinguish VT and SWCT.

After decades of rigorous research, the quest for an effective, simplified, and practical means to noninvasively differentiate WCTs has brought forth an ever‐expanding plethora of manually applied ECG interpretation methods. While manual methods have proven their value in research settings and can be readily adopted by clinicians, arriving at correct and timely VT or SWCT diagnoses remains a challenging undertaking — even among experienced electrocardiographers.

Differences in ventricular activation velocity

Careful inspection of the first components of the QRS complex, along with its comparison to its terminal segments, serves as a means to distinguish ventricular tachycardia (VT) and supraventricular wide complex tachycardia (SWCT). This approach has been adopted by a wide variety of wide complex tachycardia (WCT) differentiation criteria and algorithms. The basis for this examination stems from the fact that SWCT and VT ordinarily demonstrate marked differences in the manner in which they engage the His‐Purkinje network.

For example, an SWCT with left bundle branch block aberrancy will commonly display rapid initial QRS deflections (e.g. r wave duration < 30 ms in V1 or V2, or an RS interval < 100 ms for QRS complexes in the precordial leads [V1–V6]) that arise from rapidly depolarized myocardial segments stimulated by preserved components of the His‐Purkinje network (i.e. right bundle branch). Conversely, a VT wavefront that propagates from a site of origin remote from specialized conduction tissue, and thereby must utilize slower cardiomyocyte‐to‐cardiomyocyte conduction, is expected to demonstrate delayed or "slurred" initial components of the QRS complex (e.g. R wave peak time [RWPT] in lead II ≥ 50 ms, or RS interval ≥ 100 ms in any of the precordial leads [V1–V6]). However, once the VT impulse engages the conduction system and swiftly activates the remainder of the ventricular myocardium, the terminal components of the QRS complex will correspondingly demonstrate more rapid or "sharper" deflections compared with what was observed at the beginning of the QRS complex.

### Management of cardiac conduction abnormalities and arrhythmia in aircrew [^115TT3D7]. Heart (2019). Low credibility.

Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) is defined as a run of narrow complex tachycardia and may be asymptomatic or associated with palpitations. It may last for seconds to days; however, sustained SVT is defined as having a duration of > 30 seconds. The aetiology of SVT includes AV nodal re-entrant tachycardia (AVNRT) caused by a dual AV nodal pathway (approximately 60%), AV re-entrant tachycardia (AVRT) caused by an accessory pathway (30%), and atrial tachycardias caused by foci or small re-entrant circuits in the right or left atrium (10%).

While AVNRT and AVRT often occur in otherwise healthy subjects, atrial tachycardias are often associated with structural heart disease or hypertension and require investigation in aircrew to exclude an underlying aetiology. Tachycardias usually start suddenly and are usually symptomatic, with distracting symptoms such as palpitations, nausea, dizziness, or haemodynamic symptoms like syncope or presyncope, all being of significant concern in an aircrew population. As a result, all tachyarrhythmias are initially disqualifying for aircrew and require further investigation and management. In cases of suspected SVT, information about alcohol, caffeine, or supplement intake is important because these agents may be provocative.

Little data exist in aircrew populations; however, in a review of 430 US military aircrew evaluated for SVT over a median 8 years follow-up, 42 (10%) had haemodynamically relevant symptoms including syncope, presyncope, light-headedness, chest discomfort, dyspnoea, or visual changes.

### Wide complex tachycardia differentiation: A reappraisal of the state-of-the-art [^115LHJZb]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

In many cases, VT and SWCT cannot be confidently distinguished using 12-lead ECG interpretation alone. Occasionally, standard criteria to establish VT diagnoses may not be unequivocally present or absent (e.g. "Are those small deflections dissociated P waves or ECG artifact?"), and manual measurements essential for establishing the correct diagnosis may be at the margin of predefined thresholds (e.g. "Is the RS interval convincingly < 100 ms or ≥ 100 ms?"). Additionally, there are occasions where criteria tend to be quite vulnerable to human error and imprecision (e.g. measurement of Vi/Vt for minuscule QRS complexes in lead aVR). Furthermore, it is not rare for WCT to simultaneously possess ECG characteristics consistent with both VT and SWCT.

Many diagnostically challenging VT subtypes (e.g. fascicular VT or bundle branch reentry) routinely escape ECG criteria emphasized by standard WCT differentiation methods. As a result of the aforementioned diagnostic challenges, it is easy to see why subscribing to one or more WCT methods that wholly commit to an absolute VT or SWCT diagnosis is problematic. Consequently, several authors have chosen to devise an alternative approach to differentiating WCTs, such as point-based algorithms. Rather than absolutely committing to a definite SWCT or VT diagnosis for every WCT, point-based scoring methods purposely aim to identify WCTs with near-certain VT or SWCT diagnoses. For example, the point-based algorithm put forth by Jastrzebski et al. (i.e. the VT score) has been developed to address these challenges.

### Electrocardiographic manifestations: narrow QRS complex tachycardias [^115d6Z3Y]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Narrow QRS complex tachycardia is a common dysrhythmia in emergency medicine practice. Diagnosis and mechanism can often be determined through 12-lead electrocardiographic (EKG) analysis, although electrophysiologic testing may subsequently be required. The clinical manifestations vary and are dependent on heart rate, prior cardiac disease, and general physiological status.

- **Patient management**: Directed towards the etiology and mechanism of the dysrhythmia, management includes vagal maneuvers, pharmacologic therapy, and cardioversion. Prompt treatment is required for hemodynamically compromised patients.

Patients are often admitted to the hospital, but selected patients can be safely discharged from the emergency department for outpatient evaluation and management. Pediatric and pregnant patients are generally treated in the same manner as adults. Several case examples and EKGs are presented.

### Shortening of the short refractory periods in short QT syndrome [^114rRkWs]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). High credibility.

Thus, based on these findings, we propose a simple diagnostic technique for differentiating SQTS from the general population. Although invasive, this would be useful for patients with borderline QT presenting with syncope, or even for asymptomatic cases, to avoid unnecessary follow-up. However, asymptomatic SQTS does not require special management according to the guidelines. Measurement of the refractory period (RP) offers the first objective technique for SQTS diagnosis, as QT measurement has many drawbacks, whereas RP measurement is straightforward.

Arrhythmogenesis in SQTS has been attributed to heterogeneous abbreviation of the action potential duration among different cell types of the ventricular wall in a canine ventricular-wedge model of SQTS. The relationship between the shortening of the QT interval and ventricular arrhythmias has also been studied in computer models of the human ventricle carrying a HeRG mutation known to be involved in SQTS. The authors reported that the mutation accelerated ventricular repolarization, shortened the action potential (AP) duration and the effective ventricular RP, while increasing electrical heterogeneity in some local areas, leading to an increased risk of re-entrant arrhythmia. Shortening of the RP was associated with a reduction in the tissue size required to sustain re-entrant circuits in both two and three dimensions. Based on these results, a shortening of ventricular RP may be directly correlated with an increased risk of ventricular arrhythmia in SQTS, although shorter RPs were not linked to the induction of ventricular fibrillation.

### Initial evaluation and management of wide-complex tachycardia: A simplified and practical approach [^114EjykT]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019).

The evaluation and treatment of wide QRS-complex tachycardia remain a challenge, and mismanagement is quite common. Diagnostic aids, such as wide-complex tachycardia algorithms, perform poorly in real-life settings. The purpose of this review is to offer a simple clinical-electrocardiographic approach for the initial evaluation and management of adult patients with stable wide-complex tachycardia that does not require recollection of complex guidelines or algorithms.

### Wide complex tachycardia differentiation: A reappraisal of the state-of-the-art [^117RvwTu]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

- **Hallmark ECG features of ventricular tachycardia (VT)**: Historically, the identification of atrioventricular dissociation can be quite challenging. In general, atrioventricular dissociation may be recognized in roughly one-fifth of VTs recorded by 12‐lead ECG. For many cases, VT will coexist with an atrial arrhythmia (e.g. atrial fibrillation) that lacks organized atrial depolarization (i.e. P waves). On other occasions, atrioventricular dissociation simply cannot be recognized because of overlying QRS complexes and T waves that obscure dissociated P wave activity. Furthermore, it is essential to recognize that up to approximately half of VTs will demonstrate retrograde ventriculoatrial conduction, where ventricular impulses conduct retrograde through the His‐Purkinje system to depolarize the atria. In such cases, VTs will not exhibit atrioventricular dissociation; instead, they demonstrate a regular (e.g. 1:1 ventriculoatrial conduction) or an erratic (e.g. ventriculoatrial conduction with variable block) relationship.

AV indicates atrioventricular; LAD, left axis deviation; LBBB, left bundle branch block; NW, northwest; RAD, right axis deviation; RBBB, right bundle branch block; RWPT, R wave peak time; and WCT, wide complex tachycardia.

### Shortening of the short refractory periods in short QT syndrome [^111U2QC7]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). High credibility.

Additional ECG markers have been proposed to identify true SQTS among patients with borderline QT interval, such as a virtual ST segment, symmetrical and narrow T waves, PQ segment depression, or decrease of QT during exercise. These abnormalities could be helpful to identify SQTS among patients with borderline QT interval. However, the presence of borderline forms remains an issue, carrying the risk of under- and overdiagnosis. Therefore, a robust repolarization parameter with better measurement reliability, less inter/intraobserver variability, and less interdependence with the heart rate than QT duration, or showing different rate dependence, would be very useful for SQTS diagnosis.

In 2004, Gaita et al. performed non-invasive programmed ventricular stimulation through the implantable cardioverter defibrillator of 5 implanted SQTS patients. Ventricular RP were short (145 ± 13 ms) and prolonged after quinidine treatment to 220 ± 22 ms. Ventricular RP had also been measured during a standard electrophysiological study in 2 of these patients with SQTS and did not exceed 150 ms at any pacing site or pacing cycle length. More recently, in the European registry, 28 patients had undergone electrophysiological study, and ventricular RP varied between 140 and 200 ms (mean 166 ± 21) and were correlated to HERG mutations (151 ± 14 with versus 176 ± 24 ms, P = 0.01) but not to clinical events. Normal values for baseline ventricular RP in control populations are expected to be higher, previously evaluated to 253 ± 27 ms or 245 ± 21 ms.

### Speech-induced atrial tachycardia: an unusual presentation of supraventricular tachycardia [^113PeGyy]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2013). Low credibility.

A 63-year-old male radio announcer was admitted with a narrow complex, long RP tachycardia. While in the awake state, the patient spoke in his radio voice, initiating and maintaining the tachycardia. Three-dimensional electroanatomic mapping during an electrophysiology study localized the tachycardia to the ostium of the right superior pulmonary vein. After a single radiofrequency energy application, no further arrhythmias could be induced with speech. At more than 1 year of follow-up, the patient had no recurrences and continues to work as a radio announcer.

### V-a-a-v activation sequence at the onset of a long RP tachycardia: What is the mechanism [^117RXNtQ]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2015). Low credibility.

The differential diagnosis of a long RP tachycardia, with the site of earliest atrial activation at the CS ostium (Fig. 1), includes a fast-slow type AV nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT), AV reentrant tachycardia (AVRT) using a slowly conducting posteroseptal accessory pathway as the retrograde limb, and a septal atrial tachycardia (AT). The absence of atrial resetting by premature ventricular stimuli delivered during His-bundle refractoriness was consistent with the absence of retrograde atrial activation over an AP, though did not rule out its concealed presence.

This case illustrates an important observation in the differential diagnosis of supraventricular tachycardia with an initial "V-A-A-V" sequence upon cessation of ventricular pacing. The atrial response (V-A-A-V or V-A-V) following cessation of entrainment or induction of the tachycardia by ventricular pacing provides useful diagnostic information to distinguish AT from AVNRT. A "V-A-A-V" sequence is typically diagnostic of AT, whereas a "V-A-V" response excludes this diagnosis.

However, the study population upon which this criterion was defined may have been biased by not including atypical AVNRT (which cannot be excluded on the basis of the "V-A-A-V" sequence), whereas typical AV nodal reentry, which was included in that study, is unlikely to explain the second "A" of the "V-A-A-V" sequence. This sequence occurs immediately after the first "A", caused by retrograde conduction through the AV node. Therefore, it is important to identify the origin of both "A" of an initial "V-A-A-V" activation sequence.

### What is this? VT versus SVT [^112QMSyV]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Low credibility.

We present a patient who had a wide QRS tachycardia; it was initially difficult to determine whether it was supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) or ventricular tachycardia (VT). By some criteria — sinus capture beats, pseudo-δ waves, and wide QRS — the patient's ECG was suggestive of VT of epicardial origin. On the coronary angiogram, it was found that this patient had significant coronary artery disease. He was treated with three stents and later underwent a full electrophysiological study. We present here the ECGs, the differential diagnosis, and a brief review of the diagnostic features of epicardial VT.

### Diagnostic testing and the average absolute likelihood ratio: Application to diagnosing wide QRS complex tachycardia and other ED diseases [^112zZNYB]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

The Bayesian approach to disease diagnosis in the emergency department is facilitated by the use of likelihood ratios (LRs) to evaluate diagnostic tests. The use of dichotomous, interval, and joint LRs for single and multiple tests is reviewed, and comparison is made to regression modeling. The clinical motivation for a single statistic to describe the average change in the odds of disease associated with the use of a particular test or series of tests is described. This new extension of the LR concept is termed the average absolute LR (AALR). Illustrative examples include the use of elevated electrocardiogram ST segment and troponin to diagnose acute myocardial infarction, and serum D-dimer and computed tomographic angiography to diagnose pulmonary embolism. Finally, a detailed example with original data demonstrating the use of the AALR to compare QRS duration, QRS axis, and the two tests combined to diagnose ventricular tachycardia in patients with stable sustained regular wide QRS tachycardia is provided. Application of both tests together to patients with broad QRS complex tachycardia changes the odds of ventricular tachycardia, on average, by a factor of 3.5 (95% confidence interval, 2.4–6.2). Challenges are described, and methods are provided to estimate the 95% confidence interval of the LR and AALR using bootstrapping techniques. The AALR is a test statistic that may be helpful for clinicians and researchers in evaluating and comparing diagnostic testing approaches.

### Enhanced diagnosis of narrow complex tachycardias with increased electrocardiograph speed [^112y8io3]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to determine if the addition of rapid speed (50 mm/s) electrocardiograms (EKGs) improves the clinician's diagnostic accuracy of narrow complex tachycardias when compared to standard speed (25 mm/s) EKGs. We conducted a prospective, comparative trial. Forty-five difficult narrow complex tachycardias (heart rate range: 150–250 beats per minute) were printed at both 25 mm/s and 50 mm/s.

Eight board-certified emergency physicians initially interpreted the standard speed EKG (standard group) and chose a therapy for the hypothetical patient. These eight participants later interpreted the same 45 EKGs using both the standard and rapid speed EKGs (rapid group) and again chose a therapy. The gold standard for each EKG was based on the patient's clinical diagnosis and was independently confirmed in all cases by a board-certified cardiologist.

- **Rhythm distribution**: Atrial flutter (17), atrial fibrillation (11), paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (15), and sinus tachycardia (2).

Participants were masked to all clinical information and EKG ratios. Diagnostic accuracy was compared using McNemar's chi-squared test. Correct diagnosis improved from 226/360 (63%) in the standard group to 257/360 (71%) in the rapid group, with a difference in means of 8.6% (p = 0.002). The incorrect use of adenosine decreased from 43/240 (18%) in the standard group to 32/240 (13%) in the rapid group, with a difference in means of 4.5% (p = 0.06).

In conclusion, correct diagnosis of difficult narrow complex tachycardias improved when EKGs were analyzed at both 25 mm/s and 50 mm/s.

### V-a-a-v activation sequence at the onset of a long RP tachycardia: What is the mechanism [^115AVTsW]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2015). Low credibility.

"V-A-V" activation sequence at the onset of supraventricular tachycardia was induced by RV apical pacing at an S-S cycle length of 420 milliseconds. The first two paced cycles captured the atria with a short VA interval, and the earliest site of atrial activation was recorded in the His-bundle region, consistent with retrograde conduction over a fast pathway. The third paced cycle was blocked over the fast pathway, though it activated the atrium near the ostium of the CS (A5–6) following a long VA interval, consistent with retrograde conduction over a slow pathway, followed by the onset of the tachycardia. The fourth pacing stimulus did not capture the RV apex. See text for further explanations. The abbreviations are the same as in Figure 1.

Presuming a diagnosis of atypical AVNRT, we proceeded with the ablation of a slow pathway in the posteroseptal right atrium near the CS ostium, at the site of earliest retrograde atrial activation. This was associated with a junctional rhythm during the delivery of radiofrequency energy and eliminated the inducible tachycardia.

### Shortening of the short refractory periods in short QT syndrome [^112QUZwt]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Between 2005 and 2015, 16 successive patients with SQTS (14 men, 24 ± 10 years old) from 8 unrelated families (median 1/family) were investigated, while 15 subjects without SQTS (11 men, 27 ± 14 years old) were prospectively included to serve as the control group. Diagnosis of SQTS was made according to the guidelines: each patient had a history of QTc interval shorter than 340 ms or < 360 ms in association with resuscitated SD, and/or a family history of SD < 40 years old, and/or familial SQTS.

The controls were subjects without any heart disease or cardioactive drug, who had been invasively investigated at our center for ablation of supraventricular tachycardia (retrograde accessory pathway n = 8, atrioventricular node re‐entrant tachycardia n = 2) or for investigation of noncardiac syncope (n = 2), palpitations (n = 1), and idiopathic premature ventricular beats (n = 2).

### New algorithm using only lead aVR for differential diagnosis of wide QRS complex tachycardia [^11475wTk]. Heart Rhythm (2008). Low credibility.

We recently reported an ECG algorithm for the differential diagnosis of regular wide QRS complex tachycardias, which was superior to the Brugada algorithm.

- **Objective**: The purpose of this study was to further simplify the algorithm by omitting the complicated morphologic criteria and restricting the analysis to lead aVR.

- **Methods**: In this study, 483 wide QRS complex tachycardias [351 ventricular tachycardias (VTs), 112 supraventricular tachycardias (SVTs), 20 preexcited tachycardias] from 313 patients with proven diagnoses were prospectively analyzed by two of the authors blinded to the diagnosis. Lead aVR was analyzed for (1) the presence of an initial R wave, (2) the width of an initial r or q wave > 40 ms, (3) notching on the initial downstroke of a predominantly negative QRS complex, and (4) ventricular activation-velocity ratio (v(i)/v(t)), the vertical excursion (in millivolts) recorded during the initial (v(i)) and terminal (v(t)) 40 ms of the QRS complex. When any of criteria 1 to 3 was present, VT was diagnosed; when absent, the next criterion was analyzed. In step 4, v(i)/v(t) > 1 suggested SVT, and v(i)/v(t) ≤ 1 suggested VT.

- **Results**: The accuracy of the new aVR algorithm and our previous algorithm was superior to that of the Brugada algorithm (P = 0.002 and P = 0.007, respectively). The aVR algorithm and our previous algorithm had greater sensitivity (P < .001 and P = 0.001, respectively) and negative predictive value for diagnosing VT, as well as greater specificity (P < .001 and P = 0.001, respectively) and positive predictive value for diagnosing SVT compared with the Brugada algorithm.

### Narrow complex tachycardias [^112AUQWr]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2022). Low credibility.

Narrow-complex tachycardias are commonly encountered during shifts in the emergency department. Although some patients present with hemodynamic instability due to arrhythmia, it is crucial to recognize that the tachycardia may result from an underlying condition. Rapid identification of the type and etiology of the arrhythmia is essential for directing appropriate management strategies and making disposition decisions.

### V-a-a-v activation sequence at the onset of a long RP tachycardia: What is the mechanism [^112mxWvx]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2015). Low credibility.

A 52-year-old woman with a history of multiple episodes of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia underwent electrophysiologic studies and a catheter ablation procedure. The 12-lead electrocardiogram during tachycardia showed a long RP tachycardia with negative P waves in leads II, III, and aVF. At baseline, dual atrioventricular (AV) and ventriculoatrial (VA) nodal conduction was elicited by atrial and ventricular premature stimulation.

During the intravenous administration of isoproterenol, the earliest site of atrial activation during ventricular pacing was observed near the His bundle, and a previously recorded narrow QRS tachycardia was reproducibly induced by premature or rapid ventricular apical pacing, with an initial V-A-A-V activation sequence. During tachycardia, the HA and AH intervals measured 71 and 342 milliseconds, respectively, and the earliest atrial activation was recorded at the ostium of the coronary sinus (CS).

The earliest first "A" of the initial "V-A-A-V" activation sequence was recorded in the His bundle region, reflecting conduction over a fast pathway (FP), as was observed during ventricular pacing, while the second "A" was recorded near the CS ostium, as was observed during the tachycardia. The interval between the first and second "A" was often shorter than the subsequent tachycardia cycle length. Premature ventricular stimuli delivered during tachycardia while the His bundle was refractory did not reset the atrial cycle. From these observations, what is the mechanism of tachycardia?

### Wide complex tachycardia differentiation: A reappraisal of the state-of-the-art [^111ipxDz]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

Decades of research have produced a rich literature base and an expanding myriad of diagnostic approaches to help clinicians accurately differentiate wide complex tachycardias (WCTs). Traditional manually applied WCT differentiation methods have proven their value in distinguishing the majority of WCTs; however, they uniformly depend on the ECG interpreter for their implementation. This reliance renders them particularly susceptible to improper execution or refrained utilization.

Promising automated WCT differentiation methods that use CEI software programs are beginning to emerge, signaling the eventual introduction of novel alternative solutions to effectively distinguish ventricular tachycardia (VT) and supraventricular WCT (SWCT).

### Electrophysiologic diagnosis of narrow and wide complex tachyarrhythmias [^1159NEjp]. Heart Rhythm (2024). High credibility.

Establishing the precise mechanism of cardiac arrhythmias in the electrophysiology laboratory is one of the main requisites for a successful and safe ablation. This article provides an organized approach to the differential diagnosis of narrow and wide complex tachycardias based on the analysis of electrical activation patterns, followed by specific pacing maneuvers in each case.

### Standard ECG in Brugada syndrome as a marker of prognosis: From risk stratification to pathophysiological insights [^111oztXf]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

The importance of a prolonged QRS duration in BrS is linked to the "depolarization hypothesis", according to which abnormal depolarization coexists with repolarization abnormalities in determining the arrhythmic substrate. The prolonged QRS in this hypothesis is attributed to sodium dysfunction mainly in the conduction system and specifically in the His‐Purkinje system. Junttila et al. found a strong correlation in patients with BrS between prolonged QRS duration (< 120 ms) in leads II and V2 and prior symptoms such as syncope. In the same study, prolonged QRS duration (≥ 120 ms) in V2 was strongly associated with a history of SCD, VF, and VT (OR, 2.6; 95% CI, 1.4–4.8; P = 0.004). A Japanese study on 35 patients with BrS confirmed these correlations.

Once again, the involvement of the conduction system in BrS expressed by the QRS prolongation is linked to poor prognosis.

- **R wave in lead aVR**: The importance of the aVR lead consists in its ability to explore the RVOT. A critical analysis of the morphology of this lead in BrS can provide a series of useful information. In 2007, Babai Bigi et al. first identified the aVR sign in 24 male patients with mixed BrS. The authors defined a significant aVR sign as an R wave ≥ 0.3 mV or R/q ratio ≥ 0.75 in the aVR lead. Despite the small cohort of patients, in the presence of the type 1 ECG pattern, the aVR sign appeared to be associated with syncope, VT/VF, and aborted SCD. This initial finding was not confirmed in 2 larger studies, where the aVR sign was not related to syncope, VT/VF, or aborted SCD.

### ECG clues for diagnosing ventricular tachycardia mechanism [^115xCNcq]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2008). Low credibility.

Three mechanisms underlie the initiation and maintenance of ventricular tachycardia: automaticity, triggered activity, and reentry. Although these mechanisms seem straightforward, assessing which mechanism is operative in a particular patient's ventricular tachycardia can be difficult. The optimal treatment strategy for ventricular tachycardia in a given patient can be influenced by the mechanism underlying it. Appropriately counseling patients, choosing the optimal pharmacologic agent that maximizes efficacy while minimizing undesirable side effects, risks, and toxicities, and recommending and timing ablative therapy all hinge on identifying the probable mechanism of ventricular tachycardia.

Much has been published regarding invasive electrophysiologic maneuvers that allow for the correct diagnosis of the ventricular tachycardia mechanism. The aim of this clinical review is to provide insight into VT mechanisms based on ECG clues of spontaneous arrhythmia events and the response to pharmacologic manipulation prior to invasive electrophysiologic evaluation.

### Response to atrial extrastimulus during supraventricular tachycardia: What is the mechanism [^11285GMx]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2013). Low credibility.

We describe a case illustrating the potential challenges in distinguishing AV nodal reentry tachycardia (AVNRT) from automatic junctional tachycardia (JT). While an early atrial extrastimulus advanced the next His and ventricular depolarization without tachycardia termination, suggesting JT, other features indicated the correct diagnosis of AVNRT. This teaching case demonstrates a novel exception to a recently reported diagnostic pacing maneuver and illustrates the importance of considering response to multiple maneuvers in reaching a diagnosis of SVT mechanism.

### Shortening of the short refractory periods in short QT syndrome [^115UkbUe]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

We found that a baseline ventricular refractory period (RP) cut-off value of 200 ms may help in diagnosing short QT syndrome (SQTS) in patients with borderline QT values with sufficient confidence. An additional, higher decrease in RP may also provide further help in diagnosing SQTS for patients with borderline RP, according to our data, even if no specific cut-off value could be proposed.

Although the refractory period was found to be grossly correlated with QT intervals, RP is not a complete surrogate for QT duration. Even for the shortest QT durations in control subjects, RPs remain consistently higher compared to true SQTS patients. A 200 ms cut-off value seems to reliably separate true SQTS from normal subjects, even with relatively short QT durations. In normal subjects with the shortest QT (40% of our control population had QTc between 360 and 400 ms), no RP was found to be shorter than 200 ms. Conversely, none of the borderline QT cases (between 340 and 360 ms in one-third of true SQTS cases) had an RP greater than 200 ms.

### Wide complex tachycardia differentiation: A reappraisal of the state-of-the-art [^115c11zh]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

Decades of clinical research have brought forth a wide variety of thoughtfully designed methods to differentiate ventricular tachycardia (VT) and supraventricular wide complex tachycardia (SWCT). Separate from choosing the ideal electrophysiological determinants to secure accurate wide complex tachycardia (WCT) differentiation, algorithm creators were accountable for devising the organizational structure and operative mechanics that would enable their algorithm's generalized use.

- **Strategic blueprints for traditional methods**: In the following sections, we: (1) review the most common algorithm designs, (2) discuss the overarching rationale behind their formulation, and (3) examine the unique advantages and limitations for each diagnostic approach.

- **Multistep algorithms**: Without question, the most commonly utilized approaches to differentiate WCTs are the multistep decision-tree algorithms, including the Brugada, Vereckei aVR, and limb lead algorithms. In general, multistep algorithms prompt users to address a series of sequentially applied inquiries, with each step requesting the ECG interpreter to determine whether a highly specific attribute of VT is present or absent. If an affirmative response is rendered at any particular algorithm step, the algorithm's application is complete, and a VT diagnosis is secured. On the other hand, before SWCT is diagnosed, the ECG interpreter must navigate through the entire algorithm and confirm that each step warrants a negative response. In other words, SWCT diagnoses may only be reached once all highly specific attributes for VT, examined by the particular multistep algorithm, are absent.

### Wide complex tachycardia differentiation: A reappraisal of the state-of-the-art [^112Fqt3h]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

The value of comparing a patient's wide complex tachycardia (WCT) and baseline electrocardiogram (ECG) should not be underestimated. In 1985, Dongas et al. confirmed that WCTs with unchanged QRS configurations in leads V1, II, and III compared with the preexisting bundle branch block during sinus rhythm were nearly always supraventricular wide complex tachycardia (SWCT), while WCTs with noticeably different QRS configurations were usually ventricular tachycardia (VT). Later, in 1991, the multivariate analysis put forth by Griffith and colleagues verified that substantial deviation in the QRS axis (i.e. QRS axis change ≥ 40°) compared with the baseline ECG was one of the most predictive ECG features to diagnose VT. More recently, Pachon et al. utilized comparisons of QRS morphology between the WCT and the baseline ECG as one of the significant diagnostic determinants within their point-based algorithm.

Recently, we introduced novel WCT differentiation methods that leverage the magnitude of change between the WCT and baseline ECG as a means to effectively distinguish VT and SWCT. We described how universally available computerized measurements derived from cardiac electrophysiology information (CEI) software may be used to precisely quantify specific changes between the WCT and baseline rhythms. For example, the so-called WCT Formula uses quantifiable QRS amplitude changes (e.g. frontal and horizontal percent amplitude change) between paired WCT and baseline ECGs to establish an estimated VT probability. Similarly, the VT prediction model utilizes measurable changes in the QRS axis, T axis, and QRS duration between paired WCT and baseline ECGs to determine VT likelihood.

### Shortening of the short refractory periods in short QT syndrome [^1121Y6xx]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

The clinical characteristics of SQTS patients and controls are detailed. Nine SQTS patients experienced symptoms, including cardiac arrest (n = 2), syncope (n = 4), or palpitations (n = 3). Eleven patients had a family history of sudden death (SD), and one had a history of atrial fibrillation. Genetic screening was conducted but did not reveal mutations. Three SQTS patients received an implantable cardioverter defibrillator. No SQTS patients or control subjects had any heart disease, used cardioactive drugs, or had relevant comorbidities linked to changes in myocardial electrical parameters.

Patients with SQTS and control subjects had similar cardiac rates before programmed stimulation (70 ± 10 bpm versus 67 ± 11 bpm, P = ns). The QT interval (308 ± 29 ms versus 397 ± 36 ms, P = 0.0007) and QTc interval (324 ± 24 ms versus 417 ± 32 ms, P < 0.0001) were significantly shorter in SQTS patients than in controls.

- **Electrophysiological study**: Median pacing thresholds were 0.5 V at the right atrium, 0.5 V at the RV apex, and 1 V at the RVOT, with no significant differences between SQTS patients and controls.

	- AH interval (88 ± 54 ms versus 88 ± 33 ms), HV interval (44 ± 4 ms versus 42 ± 10 ms), atrioventricular node RP (308 ± 74 ms versus 304 ± 51 ms), and Wenckebach cycle length (390 ± 102 ms versus 350 ± 51 ms) showed no significant differences.

Atrial RP were shorter in SQTS patients compared to controls at 600-ms, 500-ms, and 400-ms basic cycle lengths.

### Shortening of the short refractory periods in short QT syndrome [^116f5fYv]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

There was no significant correlation between baseline atrial or ventricular refractory periods and clinical parameters or the induction of atrial fibrillation or ventricular fibrillation in patients with short QT syndrome (SQTS), although refractory periods were found to be shorter in inducible cases. Baseline ventricular refractory periods were shorter at each cycle length in patients with familial sudden death, but this was significant for right ventricular apex (RVA) only (data not shown). Baseline ventricular refractory periods were positively correlated to QT intervals (P < 0.05).

### Wide complex tachycardia differentiation: A reappraisal of the state-of-the-art [^114v2eyr]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

The primary goal of the initial ECG evaluation of every wide complex tachycardia is to determine whether the tachyarrhythmia has a ventricular or supraventricular origin. The answer to this question drives immediate patient care decisions, ensuing clinical workup, and long-term management strategies. Thus, the importance of arriving at the correct diagnosis cannot be understated and has naturally spurred rigorous research, which has brought forth an ever-expanding abundance of manually applied and automated methods to differentiate wide complex tachycardias.

In this review, we provide an in-depth analysis of traditional and more contemporary methods to differentiate ventricular tachycardia and supraventricular wide complex tachycardia. In doing so, we:

- **Review hallmark wide complex tachycardia differentiation criteria**: Examine the main characteristics used to distinguish between types of tachycardia.
- **Examine the conceptual and structural design of standard differentiation methods**: Explore how existing methods are developed and structured.
- **Discuss practical limitations of manually applied ECG interpretation approaches**: Address the challenges and limitations associated with manual ECG evaluation.
- **Highlight recently formulated methods designed to differentiate automatically**: Focus on new technologies and methods designed to improve accuracy and efficiency in differentiation.

### What an anesthesiologist should know about pediatric arrhythmias [^116tmmMa]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2024). Low credibility.

Identifying and treating pediatric arrhythmias is essential for pediatric anesthesiologists. Pediatric patients can present with narrow or wide complex tachycardias, though the former is more common. Patients with inherited channelopathies or cardiomyopathies are at increased risk. Since most pediatric patients present for anesthesia without a baseline electrocardiogram, the first identification of an arrhythmia may occur under general anesthesia.

Supraventricular tachycardia, the most common pediatric tachyarrhythmia, represents a broad category of predominantly narrow complex tachycardias. Stimulating events, including intubation, vascular guidewire manipulation, and surgical stimulation, can trigger episodes. Valsalva maneuvers are unreliable as treatment, making adenosine or other intravenous antiarrhythmics the preferred acute therapy.

- **Reentrant tachycardias**: The most common supraventricular tachycardia in pediatric patients, including atrioventricular reciprocating tachycardia (due to a distinct accessory pathway) and atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (due to an accessory pathway within the atrioventricular node).

- **Patients with ventricular preexcitation**: Often referred to as Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, these patients have a wide QRS with a short PR interval, indicating antegrade conduction through the accessory pathway. They are at risk for sudden death if atrial fibrillation degenerates into ventricular fibrillation over a high-risk accessory pathway.

- **Automatic tachycardias**: Such as atrial tachycardia and junctional ectopic tachycardia, are additional causes of supraventricular tachycardia.

### Five criteria predict induction and ablation of supraventricular tachycardia [^1179EtDg]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2025). Low credibility.

Electrophysiological study (EPS) and ablation are considered primary therapies for supraventricular tachycardia (SVT); however, there are no guidelines to identify the patients who are most likely to benefit from the procedure. In published studies, SVT cannot be induced in approximately 30% of patients referred for EPS, which can make definitive therapy through ablation problematic or unfeasible.

In this study, we identified five preoperative features that strongly predict a patient's likelihood of having SVT induced and ablated during EPS:

1. A characteristic electrocardiogram (EKG) recording of SVT, characterized by regular tachycardia lasting the entire duration of the tracing and not consistent with sinus tachycardia, atrial fibrillation (AF), or atrial flutter (AFL).

2. Termination of SVT with adenosine.

3. Termination of SVT or symptoms with vagal maneuvers.

4. A monitored episode of SVT lasting ≥ 30 seconds.

5. Pre-excitation on the baseline EKG.

When these features are considered together, patients exhibiting at least one of the five features had a 76% probability of SVT induction and an 88% chance of SVT ablation. Conversely, those who did not exhibit any of these features had only a 19% chance of induction and a 26% chance of ablation.

### Wide complex tachycardia differentiation: A reappraisal of the state-of-the-art [^117KL2Lr]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

The differentiation of wide complex tachycardia is critical for effective patient management in emergency settings. Techniques and criteria for distinguishing between ventricular tachycardia (VT) and supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) with aberrancy have evolved. Traditional algorithms, including Brugada and Vereckei, are commonly employed but have limitations. Recent studies emphasize the role of advanced imaging and electrophysiological studies to improve diagnostic accuracy.

Understanding the electrophysiological mechanisms underlying tachycardia is crucial. This includes recognizing the role of pre-existing bundle branch blocks and accessory pathways in altering QRS morphology. Clinical context, such as patient history and comorbidities, often guides differential diagnosis and management strategies. Despite advancements, the interpretation of wide complex tachycardia remains complex, necessitating continuous education and research in this field.

In conclusion, while significant progress has been made, accurately differentiating wide complex tachycardia continues to be a diagnostic challenge. Continuous advancement in diagnostic techniques and criteria is essential for improving patient outcomes.

### Specificity of electrocardiographic criteria for the differential diagnosis of wide QRS complex tachycardia in patients with intraventricular conduction defect [^116cNJCu]. Heart Rhythm (2013). Low credibility.

In patients with organic intraventricular conduction defects (IVCDs), QRS morphology during sinus rhythm frequently meets ventricular tachycardia (VT) morphological criteria, and there are further rate-related changes in QRS morphology.

Objective: To search for the best morphological criteria in this context.

Methods: We prospectively studied 69 patients, in sinus rhythm, with QRS duration ≥ 120 ms. Continuous rapid atrial pacing (RAP) trains were introduced at increasing rates to mimic supraventricular tachycardia. We analyzed the specificity of VT criteria during RAP. Finally, we used the criteria with a specificity of ≥ 0.9 in a "test sample" of 53 patients with preexisting IVCD and wide complex tachycardia to confirm their validity.

Results: Only 10 of the 20 analyzed criteria had a specificity of ≥ 0.9 during RAP at the highest rate. The specificity of these 10 criteria was confirmed in the test sample. The best accuracy to diagnose VT was obtained for:

- **An isolated criterion**: "R-wave peak time (RWPT) ≥ 50 ms at lead II" (specificity = 0.97; sensitivity = 0.67)
- **An algorithm**: The combination of 2 criteria "RWPT ≥ 50 ms at lead II" and "absence of RS patterns in precordial leads" (specificity = 0.97; sensitivity = 0.88).

Conclusions: In patients with IVCD, the specificity of most VT criteria is low during RAP, suggesting limited applicability of many of these criteria in cases where they develop supraventricular tachycardia. Superior accuracy to diagnose VT was observed with "RWPT ≥ 50 ms at lead II" and for an algorithm with the combination of the cited criteria.

### Impact of QRS duration of frequent premature ventricular complexes on the development of cardiomyopathy [^1118PeaQ]. Heart Rhythm (2012). Low credibility.

Patients with frequent premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) are at risk of developing reversible PVC-induced cardiomyopathy (rPVC-CMP). However, not all determinants of rPVC-CMP are known.

- **Objective**: To assess the impact of the QRS duration of PVCs on the development of rPVC-CMP.

- **Methods**: In a consecutive series of 294 patients with frequent idiopathic PVCs referred for PVC ablation, the width of the PVC-QRS complex was assessed. The QRS width was correlated with the presence of rPVC-CMP.

- **Results**: The PVC-QRS width was significantly greater in patients with rPVC-CMP than in patients without rPVC-CMP (164 ± 20 ms vs. 149 ± 17 ms; P 150 ms best differentiated patients with and without rPVC-CMP (area under the curve 0.66; sensitivity 80%; specificity 52%). The PVC burden for developing rPVC-CMP is significantly lower in patients with a PVC-QRS width of ≥ 150 ms than in patients with a narrower PVC-QRS complex (22% ± 13% vs. 28% ± 12%; P < .0001).

- **Conclusion**: Broader PVCs and an epicardial PVC origin are associated with the development of rPVC-CMP independent of the PVC burden.

### Wide-complex tachycardia: Beyond the traditional differential diagnosis of ventricular tachycardia vs supraventricular tachycardia with aberrant conduction [^114PL6en]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Wide-complex tachycardia (WCT) is defined as a rhythm disturbance with a rate greater than 100 beats/min and a QRS complex duration of 0.12 seconds or more in the adult patient; in the pediatric patient, both rate and QRS complex width are age-related. In evaluating this type of tachycardia, there are two broad categories usually discussed in the medical literature: ventricular and supraventricular with aberrant intraventricular conduction.

There are several other important causes of a WCT encountered in clinical practice, which are less often discussed; these tachycardias often require specific therapies differing from the standard approach to WCT. These tachycardias are diverse. As such, the pathophysiology behind each form of WCT includes toxic, metabolic, and conduction system dysfunction mechanisms.

### QRS complex voltage changes associated with supraventricular tachycardia [^1161WyvN]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2001). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the changes in ventricular complex voltage associated with narrow QRS supraventricular tachycardia (SVT).

- **Methods and results**: One hundred forty-five patients undergoing catheter ablation for SVT — 85 with atrioventricular (AV) nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) and 60 with AV reentrant tachycardia (AVRT) due to a concealed accessory pathway — were studied. Four consecutive tachycardia beats and four consecutive sinus beats were analyzed, excluding the last tachycardia complex and the first sinus one. For each of the 12 leads, the QRS complex voltage was measured, and the results for four beats were averaged both in SVT and in sinus rhythm (SR). The sum (sigma) of the QRS voltages measured in the 12 leads during SVT (sigmaSVT) and SR (sigmaSR) were calculated, as well as the QRS axis during SVT and SR. QRS complex voltage was significantly increased during SVT, with respect to SR, in leads II, III, aVR, aVF, and V2 to V6. Additionally, sigmaSVT was significantly greater than sigmaSR. Only lead V1 showed a significant voltage decrease during SVT. These voltage changes were almost identical in patients with AVNRT and patients with AVRT. No relationship was found between tachycardia rate and QRS voltage variation. The QRS axis showed a significant shift during SVT, from 55.8 degrees to 64.5 degrees.

- **Conclusion**: QRS voltage increase occurs in reentrant SVT, independent of the underlying reentrant circuit. The phenomenon likely depends on tachycardia-related reduced ventricular filling. This could result in the displacement of the heart in such a way.

### Five criteria predict induction and ablation of supraventricular tachycardia [^114WM9cj]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2025). High credibility.

Guidelines recommend electrophysiological study (EPS) and ablation for the primary treatment of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), but there is little information to guide patient selection for the procedure. This study aimed to identify preoperative features that would predict whether patients with signs or symptoms of tachycardia were likely to have SVT induced and ablated at EPS.

We conducted a retrospective chart review of 1089 patients referred for EPS and ablation of SVT at two high-volume centers. The population consisted of a derivation cohort of 810 patients and a validation cohort of 279 patients. Various clinical, EKG, and monitoring features were evaluated to determine their correlation with SVT induction or ablation.

Five preoperative findings predicted a high probability of SVT induction and ablation at EPS:

1. A characteristic EKG recording of SVT.
2. Termination of SVT with adenosine.
3. Termination of SVT or symptoms with vagal maneuvers.
4. An episode of SVT lasting ≥ 30 seconds on a monitor recording.
5. Pre-excitation on the baseline EKG.

Patients exhibiting at least one of these features had a high probability of SVT induction and ablation, while those exhibiting none had a low probability [Induction: 76% vs. 19%, RR = 3.96 (2.76–5.69), p < .001; Ablation: 88% versus 26%, RR = 3.32 (2.48–4.46), p < .001]. A point-based score was derived and validated to estimate the probability of induction and ablation for individual patients.

### Wide-QRS complex tachycardia [^111sres9]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

In a man with a wide-QRS complex tachycardia, a history of an inferior left ventricular scar, atrioventricular dissociation during the tachycardia, and a QRS morphology inconsistent with right or left bundle branch block exclude a diagnosis of supraventricular tachycardia with aberrant ventricular conduction due to bundle branch block or ventricular preexcitation, and establish a diagnosis of ventricular tachycardia.

### Adenosine for wide-complex tachycardia: Efficacy and safety [^111VaHEk]. Critical Care Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to determine whether adenosine is useful and safe as a diagnostic and therapeutic agent for patients with undifferentiated wide QRS complex tachycardia. The etiology of sustained monomorphic wide QRS complex tachycardia is often uncertain acutely.

- **Design**: A retrospective observational study.

- **Setting**: Treatment associated with emergency visits at nine urban hospitals.

- **Patients**: Consecutive patients treated with adenosine for regular wide QRS complex tachycardia between 1991 and 2006.

- **Interventions**: Treatment with adenosine infusion.

- **Measurements and main results**: Measured outcomes included rhythm response to adenosine, if any, and all adverse effects. A positive response was defined as an observed change in rhythm including temporary atrioventricular conduction block or tachycardia termination. A primary adverse event was defined as emergent electrical or medical therapy instituted in response to an adverse adenosine effect. A rhythm diagnosis was made in each case. The characteristics of adenosine administration as a test for a supraventricular as opposed to ventricular tachycardia were determined, and the adverse event rates were calculated. A total of 197 patients were included: 104 (90%) of 116 (95% confidence interval, 83%-95%) and two (2%) of 81 (95% confidence interval, 0.3%-9%) supraventricular tachycardia and ventricular tachycardia patients demonstrated a response to adenosine, respectively. The odds of supraventricular tachycardia increased by a factor of 36 (95% confidence interval, 9–143) following a positive response to adenosine.

### Five criteria predict induction and ablation of supraventricular tachycardia [^114XttW9]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2025). Low credibility.

- **Ekg during SVT**: EKGs recorded during episodes of SVT were classified as showing either (1) no visible P waves, (2) an rSr' pattern (VA interval 80 msec), or (4) a long RP interval (RP > PR, Figure 2A–D). Mid-RP tachycardias (RP = PR) were classified as short RP. SVT was considered irregular if the shortest RR interval was less than 85% of the longest RR interval.

- **Response to adenosine or vagal maneuvers**: Adenosine-responsive patients had at least one documented episode when SVT terminated abruptly when they were given IV adenosine. Transient slowing of the tachycardia, delayed termination, and gradual termination were not considered positive responses. Adenosine nonresponsive patients had at least one documented episode when adenosine had failed and had never had a successful termination with adenosine. Patients whose tachycardia resolved with IV diltiazem, verapamil, metoprolol, procainamide, amiodarone, or electrical cardioversion were not considered adenosine-responsive.

	- Vagal-responsive and nonresponsive patients were defined in the same way as for adenosine. Abrupt termination of either tachycardia or symptoms was considered a positive response. Successful vagal maneuvers included Valsalva, exhaling against resistance, deep breathing, coughing, carotid sinus massage, sudden exposure to cold stimuli, raising the legs, squatting, and placement of an IV catheter.

- **Monitor recordings**: Monitor recordings included those from ambulatory event monitors, implante

### Evaluation of gene validity for CPVT and short QT syndrome in sudden arrhythmic death [^116m55uB]. European Heart Journal (2022). Low credibility.

The importance of accurate phenotyping and diagnosis in patients with suspected arrhythmogenic disorders like catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is crucial for both research studies and clinical application. Researchers aim to identify novel gene-disease relationships and apply and interpret routine CPVT genetic testing accordingly. The detection of ventricular arrhythmias during exercise testing, but not at rest, is essential for diagnosing CPVT. However, other clinical characteristics atypical for CPVT should also be considered during evaluation.

- **Factors and clinical characteristics**: Demonstrating polymorphic ventricular arrhythmias during exercise testing, but not at rest, is essential for diagnosing CPVT. Other potential causes, such as arrhythmias detected by characteristic electrocardiogram abnormalities (e.g. long QT syndrome, Andersen–Tawil syndrome), cardiomyopathies detected by structural changes in the heart (e.g. arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy), and ischemic heart disease, should be excluded.

Four genes implicated in short QT syndrome (SQTS) were also classified as disputed based on the patient phenotype in published studies. For three of these genes (CACNA1C, CACNB2, and SCN5A), most of the reported cases had conflicting evidence regarding their role in SQTS.

### Wide complex tachycardia differentiation: A reappraisal of the state-of-the-art [^111xV4JH]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

Ordinarily, VT primarily relies on an inefficient means to depolarize the ventricular myocardium (i.e. cardiomyocyte-to-cardiomyocyte conduction). As a result, VT commonly expresses longer QRS durations than SWCT. This distinction was initially verified by Wellens and colleagues and later spurred interest in proposed WCT QRS duration cutoffs to define VT diagnoses: QRS > 140 ms for WCTs with a right bundle branch block pattern and QRS > 160 ms for WCTs with a left bundle branch block pattern. However, since VT and SWCT occupy broad and overlapping QRS duration ranges, the sole use of WCT QRS duration cutoffs to differentiate WCTs is unsatisfactory.

A substantial proportion of SWCTs will display QRS durations > 160 ms, especially among patients with ongoing antiarrhythmic drug use, electrolyte disturbances, dramatic conduction delays, or severe underlying structural heart disease or cardiomyopathies. On the contrary, many patients demonstrating idiopathic VT variants or VTs that arise from within or rapidly engage the His–Purkinje system demonstrate QRS durations < 140 ms. In rarer cases, VTs may demonstrate substantial impulse propagation within the conduction system and express QRS durations < 120 ms (e.g. fascicular VT), thereby not fulfilling the technical definition of WCT (i.e. heart rate ≥ 100 beats per minute and QRS duration ≥ 120 ms).

### Atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia and cannon A waves [^114Wpgyf]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Regular, narrow complex tachycardia with a ventricular rate around 150 can be challenging. The differential includes sinus tachycardia, atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT), atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia (AVRT), and atrial tachycardia (focal or macro re-entrant, i.e. flutter). We present a case of a 90-year-old woman presenting with shortness of breath in which the ECG was not diagnostic, but the presence of regular neck pulsations helped secure the diagnosis of AVNRT.

In AVNRT, atrial and ventricular contractions occur nearly simultaneously. When the right atrium attempts to contract against a closed tricuspid valve, an abrupt increase in venous pressure is encountered. This increase in venous pressure manifests as prominent neck pulsations termed "cannon A waves". The patient was ultimately successfully electrically cardioverted, resulting in the resolution of her presenting symptoms, neck pulsations, and tachycardia. While irregular "cannon A waves" can be seen in conditions of AV dissociation, regular "cannon A waves" strongly favor the diagnosis of AVNRT.

### Application of a new algorithm in the differential diagnosis of wide QRS complex tachycardia [^116WnNaj]. European Heart Journal (2007). Low credibility.

The Brugada criteria proposed to distinguish between regular, monomorphic wide QRS complex tachycardias (WCT) caused by supraventricular (SVT) and ventricular tachycardia (VT) have been reported to have a better sensitivity and specificity than the traditional criteria. By incorporating two new criteria, a new, simplified algorithm was devised and compared with the Brugada criteria.

- **Methods and results**: A total of 453 WCTs (331 VTs, 105 SVTs, 17 pre-excited tachycardias) from 287 consecutive patients with a proven electrophysiological (EP) diagnosis were prospectively analyzed by two of the authors blinded to the EP diagnosis. The following criteria were analyzed: (i) presence of AV dissociation, (ii) presence of an initial R wave in lead aVR, (iii) whether the morphology of the WCT corresponds to bundle branch or fascicular block, and (iv) estimation of initial (v(i)) and terminal (v(t)) ventricular activation velocity ratio (v(i)/v(t)) by measuring the voltage change on the ECG tracing during the initial 40 ms (v(i)) and the terminal 40 ms (v(t)) of the same bi- or multiphasic QRS complex. A v(i)/v(t) > 1 was suggestive of SVT, and a v(i)/v(t) ≤ 1 of VT. An initial R wave in lead aVR suggested VT.

The overall test accuracy of the new algorithm was superior (P = 0.006) to that of the Brugada criteria. The new algorithm had a greater sensitivity (P < 0.001) and negative predictive value (NPV) for VT diagnosis, and specificity (P = 0.0471) and positive predictive value (PPV) for SVT diagnosis than those of the Brugada criteria.

### A very unusual wide QRS tachycardia: VT or SVT [^113gBZky]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2023). High credibility.

A 13-year-old girl presented with recurrent wide QRS tachycardia since she was 4 years old.

- **Methods**: An electrophysiologic study was performed.

- **Results**: The electrophysiologic study showed that QRS complexes identical to those of the tachycardia could be elicited with premature atrial extrastimuli but with a shorter atrioventricular (AV) delay when the QRS was wide compared with narrow QRS complexes. The tachycardia was ablated at 9 o'clock on the tricuspid annulus, demonstrating the presence of an atriofascicular fiber.

- **Conclusion**: We believe that this atypical behavior can be explained by AV nodal-like longitudinal dissociation of a slowly conducting accessory pathway.

### The differential diagnosis of wide QRS complex tachycardia [^116DgcLa]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Wide complex tachycardia is defined as a cardiac rhythm with a rate greater than 100 beats per minute (bpm) and a QRS complex duration greater than 0.10 to 0.12 seconds in the adult patient; wide complex tachycardia (WCT) in children is defined according to age-related metrics. The differential diagnosis of the WCT includes ventricular tachycardia and supraventricular tachycardia with aberrant intraventricular conduction, covering both relatively benign and life-threatening dysrhythmias. This review focuses on the differential diagnosis of WCT with a discussion of strategies useful in making the appropriate diagnosis, when possible.

The 2022 ESC guidelines, specifically for ventricular arrhythmias, provide recommendations for the evaluation of patients with short QT syndrome. The guidelines recommend diagnosing short QT syndrome when the QTc is ≤ 360 ms and at least one of the following criteria is met:

- **Pathogenic mutation**: Presence of a known pathogenic mutation associated with short QT syndrome.
- **Family history**: A family history of short QT syndrome.
- **Survived arrhythmic event**: The patient has survived a ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation episode in the absence of heart disease.

### Wide complex tachycardia differentiation: A reappraisal of the state-of-the-art [^1155zTw9]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

The primary goal of the initial ECG evaluation of every wide complex tachycardia is to determine whether the tachyarrhythmia has a ventricular or supraventricular origin. The answer to this question drives immediate patient care decisions, ensuing clinical workup, and long-term management strategies. Thus, the importance of arriving at the correct diagnosis cannot be understated and has naturally spurred rigorous research, which has brought forth an ever-expanding abundance of manually applied and automated methods to differentiate wide complex tachycardias.

In this review, we provide an in-depth analysis of traditional and more contemporary methods to differentiate ventricular tachycardia and supraventricular wide complex tachycardia. We:

- **Review hallmark wide complex tachycardia differentiation criteria**: Examine key features that aid in distinguishing between ventricular and supraventricular origins.

- **Examine the conceptual and structural design of standard wide complex tachycardia differentiation methods**: Analyze the frameworks and principles underlying traditional approaches.

- **Discuss practical limitations of manually applied ECG interpretation approaches**: Highlight challenges and potential inaccuracies in manual diagnostic techniques.

- **Highlight recently formulated methods designed to differentiate ventricular tachycardia and supraventricular wide complex tachycardia automatically**: Explore advancements in automated diagnostic tools and their applications.

### Electrocardiographic manifestations: wide complex tachycardia due to accessory pathway [^114UXv7W]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Tachycardia with a wide QRS complex is usually due to ventricular tachycardia (VT), supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) with aberrant intraventricular conduction, or an accessory pathway-mediated dysrhythmia. The most common type of accessory pathway causing a wide complex tachycardia is the atrioventricular bypass tract. Distinguishing the accessory pathway-mediated tachycardia from VT or SVT with aberrancy is often difficult but has important clinical consequences. This article will review the diagnosis of wide complex tachycardia due to an accessory pathway and its related management in the emergent setting.

### Approach to the diagnosis and initial management of the stable adult patient with a wide complex tachycardia [^114nq5KJ]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

The initial electrocardiographic evaluation of every tachyarrhythmia should begin by addressing whether the QRS complex is wide or narrow. The most important cause of wide complex tachycardia (WCT) is ventricular tachycardia. However, supraventricular tachycardia can also manifest with a wide QRS complex. The ability to differentiate between supraventricular tachycardia with a wide QRS due to aberrancy or preexcitation and ventricular tachycardia often presents a diagnostic challenge. Identifying whether WCT is of ventricular or supraventricular origin is critical because the treatments differ, and improper therapy may have potentially lethal consequences. Although the diagnosis and treatment of sustained WCT often arise in emergency situations, this report focuses on a stepwise approach to managing WCT in relatively stable adult patients, particularly the diagnosis and differentiation of ventricular tachycardia from supraventricular tachycardia with a wide QRS complex on standard 12-lead electrocardiography.

### Five criteria predict induction and ablation of supraventricular tachycardia [^111P2W68]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2025). Low credibility.

Electrophysiological study (EPS) with ablation has supplanted medical management as the primary therapy for supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). Typical success rates range from 80% to 99%. Unfortunately, SVT cannot be induced in approximately 30% of patients who undergo EPS for evaluation of tachycardia. In such cases, the operator cannot be certain whether the symptoms are from SVT or from another arrhythmia, such as sinus tachycardia or atrial fibrillation (AF). Identifying an ablation target can be problematic or impossible. Empiric ablation of the slow pathway (SP) region carries the risk of damage to the atrioventricular node, requiring a permanent pacemaker. Non-induction of SVT frustrates both the patient and the staff, unnecessarily consumes medical resources, and exposes patients to the inconvenience, discomfort, and risk of the procedure without the benefit of definitive therapy.

Guidelines recommend EPS and ablation as first‐line therapy for patients with SVT but do not elaborate on which patients with signs and symptoms of tachycardia are most likely to benefit from the procedure. To guide patient selection, we sought to develop an algorithm for predicting whether SVT would be induced or ablated at EPS. In a large population of patients who underwent EPS for the treatment of tachycardia, we evaluated several preoperative historical and clinical features to determine which ones predicted SVT induction and ablation.

### Wide complex tachycardia differentiation: A reappraisal of the state-of-the-art [^1142WFfG]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

Wide complex tachycardia (WCT) differentiation methods typically consist of one or more ECG criteria that reflect distinctive electrophysiologic properties of ventricular tachycardia (VT) and supraventricular wide complex tachycardia (SWCT). Methods available today utilize ECG interpretation criteria to examine:

- **Relationship of atrial and ventricular depolarization**: This involves assessing how the atrial and ventricular activities relate during ECG analysis.

- **Morphological configuration of QRS complexes in specific ECG leads**: Particular attention is given to leads V1–V2 and V6.

- **WCT QRS duration**: Analyzing how long the QRS complex duration lasts within the ECG.

- **Chest lead concordance**: This checks for concordance among the chest leads.

- **Mean electrical axis (e.g. QRS axis)**: Observing the mean direction of the QRS complex.

- **Differences in ventricular activation velocity**: Examines how quickly or slowly the ventricles activate.

- **Dissimilarities compared with the baseline ECG**: Identifying how the WCT departs from a patient's baseline ECG.

Although these methods have demonstrated value in distinguishing between VT and SWCT, no single criterion or collection of criteria guarantees diagnostic certainty.

Atrioventricular dissociation, as noted by Wellens and colleagues in 1978, has become one of the most trusted ECG criteria for securing VT diagnoses. Generally, VT may be confirmed once atrioventricular dissociation is clearly identified, particularly when the ventricular rate surpasses the atrial rate. Unsurprisingly, several WCT differentiation methods include atrioventricular dissociation as a vital VT diagnostic criterion. Nevertheless, although atrioventricular dissociation is often valuable for establishing VT diagnoses, its absence does not rule out VT, as it may not be electrocardiographically apparent, even among patients with known VT.

By definition, atrioventricular dissociation exists when a self-governing ventricular rhythm autonomously persists alongside the atrial rhythm.

### Right bundle branch block-type wide QRS complex tachycardia with a reversed R/S complex in lead V: Development and validation of electrocardiographic differentiation criteria [^113iiktQ]. Heart Rhythm (2021). High credibility.

Differentiation of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) with a right bundle branch block (RBBB) pattern from ventricular tachycardia (VT) is difficult, particularly when the R/S ratio in lead V6 is below 1.0.

We sought to investigate the electrocardiographic criteria for distinguishing between these arrhythmias. We investigated electrocardiographic parameters from 111 consecutive patients who had RBBB pattern wide QRS complex tachycardia with a reversed R/S ratio in lead V6 (72 VTs, 39 SVTs). Diagnostic criteria from previous algorithms were compared with our new criterion, the RS/QRS ratio, which was defined as the ratio of the interval from the onset of the QRS complex to the nadir of the S wave, divided by the QRS width in lead V6. The RS/QRS ratio was further tested in a prospective population (31 fascicular VTs, 29 SVTs).

The diagnostic accuracy of previous criteria (Brugada algorithm, Vereckei algorithm, and R-wave peak time criterion) was only modest. However, the RS/QRS ratio in lead V6 was significantly lower in SVT than in VT (0.36 ± 0.04 vs. 0.50 ± 0.08; P < 0.01). An RS/QRS ratio > 0.41 differentiated VT from SVT with a high diagnostic accuracy (sensitivity 97.2%; specificity 89.7%). When tested in a prospective population with fascicular VT, the diagnostic accuracy of the criteria was maintained (sensitivity 90.3%; specificity 86.2%).

The RS/QRS ratio > 0.41 in lead V6 is a simple and reliable index for distinguishing VT from SVT in RBBB pattern wide QRS complex tachycardia.

### Shortening of the short refractory periods in short QT syndrome [^114vpAap]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of short QT syndrome (SQTS) remains difficult in cases of borderline QT values, as often found in normal populations. Whether some shortening of refractory periods (RP) may help in differentiating SQTS from normal subjects is unknown.

- **Methods and results**: Atrial and right ventricular RP at the apex and right ventricular outflow tract, as determined during a standard electrophysiological study, were compared between 16 SQTS patients (QTc 324 ± 24 ms) and 15 controls with similar clinical characteristics (QTc 417 ± 32 ms). Atrial RP were significantly shorter in SQTS compared with controls at 600- and 500-ms basic cycle lengths. Baseline ventricular RP were significantly shorter in SQTS patients than in controls, both at the apex and right ventricular outflow tract and for any cycle length. Differences remained significant for RP of any subsequent extrastimulus at any cycle length and any pacing site. A cut-off value of baseline RP < 200 ms at the right ventricular outflow tract, either at 600- or 500-ms cycle length, had a sensitivity of 86% and a specificity of 100% for the diagnosis of SQTS.

- **Conclusions**: Patients with SQTS have shorter ventricular RP than controls, both at baseline during various cycle lengths and after premature extrastimuli. A cut-off value of 200 ms at the right ventricular outflow tract during 600- and 500-ms basic cycle length may help in detecting true SQTS from normal subjects with borderline QT values.

### Electrocardiographic manifestations: Ventricular tachycardia [^115EL4u5]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Ventricular tachycardia is a serious rhythm disturbance originating from any part of the myocardium or conduction system below the atrioventricular node. It presents with a wide QRS complex and a rate greater than 120 beats per minute. Ventricular tachycardia is frequently encountered as a complication of coronary artery disease or cardiomyopathy. Furthermore, VT is also seen in patients experiencing medication adverse effects or electrolyte disturbances.

Electrocardiographically, ventricular tachycardia presents in several forms, including monomorphic and polymorphic VT. As is true in most Emergency Department presentations, the emergency physician must approach the dysrhythmic patient from an undifferentiated perspective, specifically in the wide complex tachycardia (WCT) scenario. The electrocardiographic differential diagnosis of WCT classically includes VT and supraventricular tachycardia with aberrant intraventricular conduction. This article reviews the electrocardiographic presentations encountered in patients with ventricular tachycardia.
