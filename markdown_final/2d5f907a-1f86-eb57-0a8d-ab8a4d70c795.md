## Question

How should I order an CT of abdomen for diverticulitis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to order a CT of the abdomen for suspected diverticulitis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about when CT is indicated versus when clinical diagnosis suffices. Then, I should verify the optimal CT protocol, including contrast strategy and coverage. Next, I will consider alternatives if CT is contraindicated or unavailable. After that, I need to ensure the order includes key clinical information and safety checks. Finally, I will integrate special populations and follow-up considerations, and close with a concise, actionable template for ordering the study.

> Let me first confirm the indication for CT in suspected diverticulitis, because I should not over-order imaging when clinical diagnosis is sufficient. In adults with suspected acute left-sided colonic diverticulitis, CT is recommended when there is diagnostic uncertainty, when complications are suspected, or when the patient fails to improve with initial therapy, whereas straightforward, mild cases in reliable patients may be managed clinically with close follow-up [^a48533a1] [^a73a107f] [^d280754b].

> Wait, let me verify the strength of evidence and guideline convergence so I don't overstate this. The ASCRS gives a strong recommendation for CT as the most appropriate initial imaging in suspected diverticulitis, the ACR Appropriateness Criteria endorse CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast for LLQ pain including suspected diverticulitis, and the ACP suggests CT when diagnostic uncertainty remains, reflecting moderate-certainty evidence for high diagnostic accuracy but low-certainty evidence for patient-centered outcomes, which aligns with a shared decision-making approach in low-risk presentations [^10199d12] [^b533fd25] [^a48533a1].

> I need to check the optimal CT protocol next. Contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast is the standard because it improves detection of bowel wall abnormalities, abscesses, fistulas, and subtle complications; oral contrast is generally unnecessary and can delay care, and low-dose techniques can preserve diagnostic performance while reducing radiation exposure, so I should specify IV contrast without routine oral contrast unless there is a specific indication such as suspected fistula or postoperative anatomy [^b533fd25] [^041794d3] [^10199d12].

> Hold on, I should verify the coverage and why it matters. Extending the scan from the diaphragm to the symphysis pubis ensures we capture alternative diagnoses and complications that may present with LLQ pain, such as appendiceal pathology, gynecologic sources, or vascular emergencies, and it allows accurate localization and classification of diverticulitis for treatment planning, which is why guidelines consistently recommend abdomen and pelvis rather than a limited field [^b533fd25] [^041794d3].

> Next, I should review alternatives when CT is contraindicated or unavailable. Ultrasound by an expert operator is a reasonable first-line alternative in some settings, with a step-up approach to CT if ultrasound is negative or inconclusive, and MRI is an option when CT is contraindicated or in pregnancy, though availability and speed in the acute setting can be limiting; I need to ensure I tailor the alternative to local expertise and patient factors [^5c57f829] [^357da5c1] [^02582c5e].

> Let me consider special populations carefully. In elderly patients, I should have a lower threshold for CT with IV contrast because presentations are often atypical and complications are easily missed; even with CKD prevalence, the diagnostic yield often outweighs contrast risks when managed appropriately, and if contrast is contraindicated, noncontrast CT or alternative modalities can be used selectively [^bd8c4215] [^8ccda950] [^7a02e3f0]. In pregnancy, ultrasound or MRI should be preferred to avoid ionizing radiation, balancing diagnostic needs with fetal safety [^02582c5e].

> I should double-check what to include in the order so the radiologist can optimize the study. The clinical indication should state "suspected acute diverticulitis", key symptoms and duration, prior episodes, immunocompromise, and any red flags such as peritonitis or sepsis; I should also specify IV contrast and request assessment for complications including abscess, free air, obstruction, and fistula, and ask for alternative diagnoses if diverticulitis is not present, which guides both protocol and reporting [^041794d3].

> But wait, what if the patient is young or has minimal symptoms; do I still need CT? In low-risk, clinically straightforward cases, a trial of conservative management with close follow-up may be reasonable, yet I should remember that clinical diagnosis alone is inaccurate in a substantial fraction of patients, so if uncertainty persists or the patient deteriorates, I should escalate to CT promptly to avoid missing complications [^a48533a1] [^9e8f85d3].

> Next, I should review follow-up and colon evaluation, because ordering the CT is only part of the care pathway. After CT-proven uncomplicated diverticulitis, routine colonoscopy is not mandated, but if the episode is complicated or if there is no recent high-quality colon evaluation, colonoscopy in 6–8 weeks is reasonable to exclude neoplasm, given CT cannot reliably distinguish malignancy from diverticulitis; I should communicate this plan clearly in the discharge summary [^396bf0e8] [^b08f6c3d].

> Let me synthesize a practical, evidence-aligned order template, and I will sanity-check each element against guidelines as I go. Order: CT abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast, no routine oral contrast, indication "suspected acute diverticulitis; LLQ pain X days, fever, leukocytosis, no prior imaging-confirmed diagnosis, assess for complications and alternative diagnoses", and add "please evaluate for abscess, free air, obstruction, fistula, and colonic wall thickening with pericolic fat stranding" to structure the radiologist's read, which matches ACR, ASCRS, and ACP guidance [^b533fd25] [^10199d12] [^a48533a1].

> Finally, I should confirm that my approach aligns with local pathways and patient preferences, and document shared decision-making when deferring CT in low-risk cases. This ensures that when I order the CT, it is timely, protocolized, and likely to change management, which is the crux of high-value imaging in suspected diverticulitis [^a48533a1] [^b533fd25].

Order a **CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast** [^b533fd25] as the first-line test for suspected diverticulitis, as it provides high sensitivity/specificity and defines complications [^b750c619] [^0e06f309]. Use **oral contrast only if bowel anatomy is distorted** or a fistula is suspected [^c9427ba2]. If IV contrast is contraindicated, use non-contrast CT or MRI [^6daadd37]; if CT is unavailable, consider ultrasound [^2b506c5a] [^2fd2eb87]. Include clinical details and specific questions about abscess, perforation, or obstruction to guide management [^041794d3].

## Indications for CT in diverticulitis

CT is indicated to **confirm the diagnosis**, assess severity, and detect complications; it is the **gold standard** for acute diverticulitis [^10199d12] [^2fd2eb87]. Use CT when:

- **Diagnostic uncertainty**: Suspected diverticulitis but unclear diagnosis [^a48533a1].
- **Severe presentation**: Severe pain, fever, leukocytosis, or peritoneal signs [^a73a107f].
- **Failure of initial therapy**: No improvement after 48–72 hours [^d280754b].
- **Immunocompromised patients**: Higher risk of complications [^a73a107f].
- **Recurrent episodes**: Multiple recurrences or planned surgery [^d280754b].

---

## Recommended CT protocol

### Contrast administration

- **Intravenous (IV) contrast**: Routine use for optimal visualization of bowel wall, abscesses, and complications [^b533fd25] [^6daadd37].
- **Oral contrast**: Not routine; use only if bowel anatomy is distorted, postoperative, or a fistula is suspected [^c9427ba2].
- **Rectal contrast**: Rarely used; consider if colonic fistula or obstruction is suspected.

---

### Scan coverage

Extend from the **diaphragm to the symphysis pubis** to fully assess colonic involvement and complications [^notfound].

---

### Radiation dose considerations

Use **low-dose protocols** when feasible to reduce radiation exposure without compromising diagnostic accuracy [^10199d12].

---

## Alternative imaging modalities

If CT is contraindicated or unavailable, consider the following:

| **Modality** | **Indications** | **Limitations** |
|-|-|-|
| Ultrasound (US) | - Initial evaluation <br/> - Pregnancy <br/> - Contrast allergy <br/> - Renal impairment | - Operator-dependent <br/> - Limited by obesity/bowel gas <br/> - May miss complications [^2b506c5a] [^357da5c1] |
| Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) | - Pregnancy <br/> - Contrast allergy <br/> - Renal impairment | - Limited availability <br/> - Longer scan time <br/> - Less specific than CT [^6daadd37] [^9e8f85d3] |
| Non-contrast CT | - Severe contrast allergy <br/> - Renal failure | - Lower sensitivity for subtle inflammation <br/> - May miss small abscesses [^de464ae9] |

---

## Clinical information to include in the CT request

Provide the following to guide imaging and interpretation:

- **Clinical suspicion**: "Suspected acute diverticulitis" with relevant history and exam findings.
- **Specific questions**: Request assessment for abscess, perforation, obstruction, or fistula.
- **Patient factors**: Note allergies, renal function, pregnancy, or immunocompromise [^notfound].

---

## Interpretation and clinical decision-making

CT findings guide management: **uncomplicated diverticulitis** shows colonic wall thickening with pericolic fat stranding and is managed medically, whereas **complicated diverticulitis** shows abscess, free air, obstruction, or fistula and may require antibiotics, drainage, or surgery [^041794d3] [^0e06f309].

---

## Follow-up imaging

Routine follow-up CT is **not required** after clinical improvement; reserve repeat imaging for patients who fail to improve or develop new complications [^notfound].

---

CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast is the **preferred study** for suspected diverticulitis, providing high diagnostic accuracy and guiding management; tailor contrast use and consider alternatives when CT is contraindicated.

Acute left-sided colonic diverticulitis — CT imaging recommendation states that ACP suggests that clinicians use abdominal computed tomography (CT) imaging when there is diagnostic uncertainty in a patient with suspected acute left-sided colonic diverticulitis (conditional recommendation; low-certainty evidence). The rationale explains that a detailed history, physical examination, and laboratory findings are the first steps, that abdominal CT imaging can be used to complement the history, examination, and laboratory findings to establish the diagnosis of diverticulitis when diagnostic uncertainty remains, that moderate-certainty evidence showed CT imaging is associated with very high sensitivity and specificity, and that low-certainty evidence from emergency department or equivalent settings showed that misdiagnoses with CT may not be associated with downstream adverse sequelae although the effect on patient outcomes is unclear. Evidence gaps note that evidence is inconclusive to assess the association between CT imaging and diverticulitis-related patient health outcomes, and values and preferences may vary across individuals with panel feedback showing variability in preferences for undergoing abdominal CT imaging.

Role of CT imaging in acute left-sided colonic diverticulitis — population, intervention, and clinical management outcomes: Patient population is adults with suspected or known diagnosis of acute left-sided colonic diverticulitis, and interventions evaluated are CT scan with or without IV, oral, or rectal contrast vs. no CT scanning. Abdominal CT scan may be associated with appropriate management of adults with suspected acute left-sided colonic diverticulitis (Certainty of evidence LOW). Falsely normal or abnormal findings on abdominal CT scan resulting in inappropriate management (poor clinical sequelae) may be rare in adults with suspected acute left-sided colonic diverticulitis, although the included studies did not report patient outcomes associated with misdiagnosis (Certainty of evidence LOW). In adults with suspected acute diverticulitis, abdominal CT scan may commonly detect incidental findings (findings not related to diverticulitis), but the clinical significance of the incidental findings is unclear (Certainty of evidence LOW).

### Can acute abdominal CT prioritize patients with suspected diverticulitis for a subsequent clean colonic examination? [^929dbd08]. Colorectal Disease (2012). Low credibility.

Aim

The aim of this study was to investigate whether patients with diverticulitis can be prioritized with higher urgency for a subsequent full colonic examination based upon the emergency abdominal CT scan performed at the time of presentation.

Method

All patients with a diagnosis of diverticulitis, hospitalized during 2006 and having a CT scan on admission and a subsequent 'clean colon' examination, were reviewed. The CT scan was reviewed by two independent and blinded senior radiologists (Radiologist A and Radiologist B) for signs inconsistent with diverticulitis and suggestive of malignancy. The patients were classified on the CT scan results into group 1 (normal findings, nontumour pathology or benign polyps < 1 cm) or group 2 (benign polyps ≥ 1 cm and cancer).

Results

Ninety-three patients (83 in group 1 and 10 in group 2) were reviewed. Radiologist A suggested high-priority colonic examination in 18% and 50% of patients in groups 1 and 2, respectively, and Radiologist B in 63% and 90% of patients, respectively. There was a statistically significant interobserver difference, and also lower accuracy of Radiologist B compared with Radiologist A in predicting a subsequent 'clean colon' examination.

Conclusion

Use of an emergency acute CT scan at the time of diagnosis of diverticulitis to predict a clean colon examination for neoplasia is not reliable because there is a considerable degree of interobserver difference between radiologists.

### A proposal for a CT driven classification of left colon acute diverticulitis [^05ad8ed6]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Computed tomography (CT) imaging is the most appropriate diagnostic tool to confirm suspected left colonic diverticulitis. However, the utility of CT imaging goes beyond accurate diagnosis of diverticulitis; the grade of severity on CT imaging may drive treatment planning of patients presenting with acute diverticulitis.

The appropriate management of left colon acute diverticulitis remains still debated because of the vast spectrum of clinical presentations and different approaches to treatment proposed. The authors present a new simple classification system based on both CT scan results driving decisions making management of acute diverticulitis that may be universally accepted for day to day practice.

### Diagnosis and management of acute left-sided colonic diverticulitis: a clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians [^75bd2649]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2022). High credibility.

ACP clinical guideline — diagnostic imaging for suspected acute left-sided colonic diverticulitis states that ACP suggests that clinicians use abdominal CT imaging when there is diagnostic uncertainty in a patient with suspected acute left-sided colonic diverticulitis (conditional recommendation; low-certainty evidence). Moderate-certainty evidence showed that CT imaging is associated with very high sensitivity and specificity to make an accurate diagnosis of diverticulitis, but potential harms from CT imaging may include incidental findings, radiation exposure, and side effects of a reaction to contrast used, and out-of-pocket costs ranged from $56 in ambulatory surgical centers to $94 in hospital outpatient departments for Medicare beneficiaries and from $580 to $4885, respectively, for uninsured adults. Abdominal ultrasonography can be considered when CT cannot be obtained, and abdominal magnetic resonance imaging can be considered when ultrasonography provides inconclusive results (for example, in obese patients and those with severe abdominal pain or extensive bowel gas). Clinicians should err on the side of imaging in patients with predictors of progression to complicated diverticulitis, including a symptom duration before clinical presentation of longer than 5 days and signs of perforation, bleeding, obstruction, or abscesses.

### Case series: diverticulitis in the young [^93839b1c]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Diverticulitis has long been regarded as a disease of the elderly, but its incidence has been increasing in those under age 40. Younger patients with diverticulitis are more likely to be male and obese. They often have atypical presentations, and 25% may have right lower quadrant pain. Not surprisingly, the condition is often misdiagnosed, resulting in unnecessary surgery. An abdominal CT scan is the modality of choice for diagnosis, but the most important diagnostic step is simply to include diverticulitis on the differential diagnosis of a young person with lower abdominal pain.

### Diagnosis and management of acute left-sided colonic diverticulitis: a clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians [^fc24199f]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Description

The American College of Physicians (ACP) developed this guideline to provide clinical recommendations on the diagnosis and management of acute left-sided colonic diverticulitis in adults. This guideline is based on current best available evidence about benefits and harms, taken in the context of costs and patient values and preferences.

Methods

The ACP Clinical Guidelines Committee (CGC) developed this guideline based on a systematic review on the use of computed tomography (CT) for the diagnosis of acute left-sided colonic diverticulitis and on management via hospitalization, antibiotic use, and interventional percutaneous abscess drainage. The systematic review evaluated outcomes that the CGC rated as critical or important. This guideline was developed using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) methodology.

Target Audience and Patient Population

The target audience is all clinicians, and the target patient population is adults with suspected or known acute left-sided colonic diverticulitis.

Recommendation 1

ACP suggests that clinicians use abdominal CT imaging when there is diagnostic uncertainty in a patient with suspected acute left-sided colonic diverticulitis (conditional recommendation; low-certainty evidence).

Recommendation 2

ACP suggests that clinicians manage most patients with acute uncomplicated left-sided colonic diverticulitis in an outpatient setting (conditional recommendation; low-certainty evidence).

Recommendation 3

ACP suggests that clinicians initially manage select patients with acute uncomplicated left-sided colonic diverticulitis without antibiotics (conditional recommendation; low-certainty evidence).

### A proposal for a CT driven classification of left colon acute diverticulitis [^2c5b4de2]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Abdominal ultrasound is an alternative imaging modality that may be useful in patients with relative contraindications to CT scanning (pregnancy, renal insufficiency, and contrast allergy). CT is therefore superior to US, especially in the detection of free air and deeply located or small fluid collections and can drive the clinicians in the management plan. Limitations of ultrasound include operator-dependency, poor assessment in obese patients and it may not be practical in patients with abdominal tenderness because the transducer probe requires compression. Some authors recommend a step-up approach with CT performed after an inconclusive or negative US.

CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis is the most appropriate imaging modality in the assessment of suspected acute diverticulitis.

CT scan should be performed in all patients with suspected complicated acute diverticulitis. In these forms CT is superior to US, especially in the detection of free air and deeply located or small fluid collections.

### Diagnosis and management of acute left-sided colonic diverticulitis: a clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians [^37c138cc]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Acute left-sided colonic diverticulitis — CT-related clinical considerations emphasize that potential harms from CT imaging include incidental findings, radiation exposure, and side effects of or allergic reactions to any contrast used, and that informed decision making should include discussion of burdens such as contraindications to contrast or limited access to CT imaging. Abdominal ultrasonography can be considered when CT cannot be obtained, and abdominal magnetic resonance imaging can be considered when ultrasonography provides inconclusive results, for example in obese patients and those with severe abdominal pain or extensive bowel gas. Clinicians should err on the side of imaging in patients with predictors of progression to complicated diverticulitis, including a symptom duration before clinical presentation of longer than 5 days and signs of perforation, bleeding, obstruction, or abscess. The diagnostic accuracy of CT to differentiate between colorectal cancer and complicated diverticulitis is not considered here, and the additional value of early cancer detection with follow-up colonoscopy after resolved episodes of acute complicated diverticulitis is discussed in another guideline.

### CT findings of misleading features of colonic diverticulitis [^053fcc14]. Insights Into Imaging (2011). Low credibility.

Colonic diverticulitis (CD) is a common entity whose diagnosis is particularly based on computed tomography (CT) examination, which is the imaging technique of choice. However, unusual CT findings of CD may lead to several difficulties and potential pitfalls: due to technical errors in the management of the CT examination, due to the anatomical situation of the diseased colon, in diagnosing unusual complications that may concern the gastrointestinal tract, intra- and retroperitoneal viscera or the abdominal wall, and in differentiating CD from other abdominal inflammatory and infectious conditions or colonic cancer. The aim of this work is to delineate the pitfalls of CT imaging and illustrate misleading CT features in patients with suspected CD.

### Diagnostic imaging for diverticulitis [^3d69c349]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2008). Low credibility.

The misdiagnosis rate of diverticulitis based solely on clinical and laboratory criteria is high and given the potential severity of diverticulitis and its complications, early and routine radiologic evaluation is recommended. Imaging is used to establish the diagnosis and its extent and severity, and to detect the presence of any complications so that management can be directed appropriately. The most widely used examinations for the diagnosis of diverticulitis are ultrasound, barium enema, computed tomography (CT), and recently, magnetic resonance imaging. Over the past decade CT has replaced barium enema mainly because of its ability to identify extracolonic extent of disease. CT scan remains the procedure of choice in the acute, symptomatic stage. Nevertheless, diverticulitis often remains a clinical diagnosis; thus communication between the clinician and the radiologist remains imperative to facilitate effective testing.

Observational cohorts detected a small number of colorectal cancers (15 cases/1000 patients) and advanced adenomas (33 cases/1000 patients), and absence of a mass lesion on CT scan does not exclude the possibility of an underlying colonic neoplasm. Several factors to perform colonoscopy include timing and completeness of a prior colonoscopy, comorbidities, persistent symptoms of abdominal pain or diarrhea, and patient preferences; although an increased risk of recurrent diverticulitis or colonic perforation is a concern, this was not reported as an adverse event in the available literature. The optimal timing is uncertain, and intervals of 6 to 8 weeks after resolution of acute diverticulitis are commonly followed.

What is the best imaging technique in patients with suspected ALCD? What is the role of ultrasound (US) in patients with ALCD?

In patients with suspected ALCD, we suggest contrast-enhanced CT scan of the abdomen as the imaging technique of first choice (weak recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence, 2B).

We suggest to use US in the initial evaluation of patients with suspected ALCD where it is performed by an expert operator. It has wide availability and easy accessibility. A step-up approach with CT performed after an inconclusive or negative US may be a safe approach for patients suspected of acute diverticulitis (weak recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence, 2B).

Radiological imaging techniques that are used for diagnosing ALCD in the emergency setting are US and CT. Currently, CT is the established method of choice when compared to US and most guidelines cite the high accuracy and other advantages of CT. This approach is the gold standard for both the diagnosis and the staging of patients with ALCD due to its excellent sensitivity and specificity. CT scan can also rule out other diagnoses such as ovarian pathology, or leaking aortic or iliac aneurysm.

CT findings in patients with ALCD may include diverticulosis with associated colon wall thickening, fat stranding, phlegmon, extraluminal gas, abscess formation, or intra-abdominal free fluid. CT imaging can go beyond accurate diagnosis of ALCD. CT criteria may also be used to determine the grade of severity and may drive treatment planning of patients. US is a real-time dynamic examination with wide availability and easy accessibility. Its limitations include operator dependency, poor assessment in obese patients, and difficulty in the detection of free gas and deeply located abscesses.

A systematic review and meta-analysis of studies that reported diagnostic accuracy of the clinical diagnosis and diagnostic modalities in patients with suspected diverticulitis was published in 2014. Summary sensitivity estimates for US were 90% (95% CI 76–98%) versus 95% (95% CI 91–97%) for CT (p = 0.86). Summary specificity estimates for US were 90% (95% CI 86–94%) versus 96% (95% CI 90–100%) for CT (p = 0.04).

### Emergency medicine updates: acute diverticulitis [^b10aebbb]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute diverticulitis is a condition commonly seen in the emergency department (ED). Therefore, it is important for emergency medicine clinicians to be aware of the current evidence regarding the diagnosis and management of this disease.

Objective

This paper evaluates key evidence-based updates concerning acute diverticulitis for the emergency clinician.

Discussion

Diverticulitis is a complication of diverticulosis and most commonly affects the sigmoid and descending colon in Western countries. History and examination can suggest the diagnosis, with abdominal pain and tenderness in the left lower quadrant being the most common symptom and sign, respectively. Change in bowel habits and fever may also occur. Laboratory testing may demonstrate leukocytosis or an elevated C-reactive protein. Imaging options can include computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis with intravenous contrast, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or ultrasound (US), though most classification systems for diverticulitis incorporate CT findings. While the majority of diverticulitis cases are uncomplicated, complications may affect up to 25% of patients. Treatment of complicated diverticulitis requires antibiotics and surgical consultation. Antibiotics are not required in select patients with uncomplicated diverticulitis. Appropriate patients for supportive care without antibiotics should be well-appearing, have pain adequately controlled, be able to tolerate oral intake, be able to follow up, have no complications, and have no immunocompromise or severe comorbidities.

Conclusions

An understanding of literature updates can improve the ED care of patients with acute diverticulitis.

### Imaging strategies for detection of urgent conditions in patients with acute abdominal pain: diagnostic accuracy study [^dba830ae]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Implications for clinical practice

For a diagnostic study to have impact in clinical practice, the results should be obtained in a representative population and setting. This multicentre study closely mimicked daily practice; a large number of residents and radiological observers, with varying levels of experience, participated. The multicentre setting included university and teaching hospitals. We believe that our results reflect the performance of imaging strategies in daily practice and are relevant to physicians managing patients with acute abdominal pain.

The use of imaging has been widely investigated for the two most common causes of acute abdominal pain — acute appendicitis and diverticulitis. In patients with suspected diverticulitis, imaging is helpful in detecting complications of diverticulitis to assist in therapeutic decisions. For suspected acute appendicitis, extensive use of CT has been shown to reduce rates of negative appendicectomy and lower overall hospital costs by preventing unnecessary admissions and surgical explorations. Although imaging in general showed a positive effect on patients' outcomes in acute appendicitis, the ideal diagnostic strategy for acute appendicitis remains a matter of debate, as imaging might not be necessary for certain presentations.

In unselected patients with acute abdominal pain, studies have shown that the use of diagnostic imaging positively affects the clinical diagnosis and influences decisions on management. Diagnostic laparoscopy has also been shown to be an accurate investigation in patients with acute abdominal pain. However, an invasive procedure can often be prevented with an accurate imaging strategy, as imaging reduced false positive clinical diagnoses. Considering the costs and invasiveness of diagnostic laparoscopy in comparison with imaging, this investigation should probably be reserved for clinically ill patients with non-diagnostic imaging or for therapeutic indications.

The lifetime risk of radiation induced fatal cancer is age dependent. The dose of radiation associated with abdominal CT in an acute abdomen is approximately 10 mSv. For a 25 year old patient, the estimated risk of induction of cancer for such a CT examination is about 1 in 900. The estimated risk of induction of fatal cancer is about 1 in 1800. For a 50 year old, the equivalent risks are 1 in 1500 and 1 in 2500. In general, consensus exists that the information obtained with diagnostic CT outweighs the risk associated with radiation and that the risk of induction of cancer should be seen in the light of the lifetime risk of cancer. In the future, magnetic resonance imaging may be valuable for making a diagnosis in acute abdominal pain. Until now, the availability of magnetic resonance imaging at the emergency department has been low and this investigation is mainly reserved for patients with a contraindication to CT, such as pregnant patients.

Although CT is the most sensitive imaging investigation for patients with suspected acute diverticulitis, a step-up approach with CT performed after an inconclusive or negative US has been proposed as safe and alternative approach for patients with suspected acute diverticulitis.

Magnetic resonance imaging, which is not constrained by the operator dependency limitation of compared to US, until now is currently difficult to perform at in the emergency department.

Acute diverticulitis — initial imaging in non-pregnant adults is outlined as follows: In non-pregnant adults with suspected acute diverticulitis, the panel suggests obtaining an abdominal CT as the initial diagnostic modality (conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence). IV contrast is usually appropriate whenever a CT scan is obtained and can be helpful to characterize and detect subtle bowel wall abnormalities and complications of diverticulitis; however, CT without IV contrast may be appropriate. If CT is unavailable or contraindicated, the panel suggests obtaining an US or MRI as the initial diagnostic modality (conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence).

Diverticulitis

Diverticular disease of the colon, which primarily affects the elderly, occurs in 50–70% of individuals aged 80 years or older. In the remaining population, approximately 5% of all patients with diverticula will develop complications of diverticulitis, such as abscess formation, fistulas, obstruction, or hemorrhage. Age in itself is not associated with complications. By contrast with the general population, right-sided diverticulitis is rare in the elderly: in a study including 223 patients with a right diverticulitis, only 30% of patients (70/223) were over 50 years of age. The clinical presentation of acute diverticulitis is nuanced in the elderly population: only 50% of patients older than 65 years report pain in the lower quadrants of the abdomen, with only 17% exhibiting fever and 43% showing no leukocytosis. In comparison with younger people, a higher proportion of older patients presented with diverticular bleeding. As in the general population, the use of CT scan with IV-contrast is recommended in elderly patients suspected of diverticulitis to confirm the diagnosis and to differentiate between complicated and non-complicated diverticulitis. While ultrasound can be useful in diagnosing diverticulitis, it has limitations, particularly in elderly patients. The accuracy of ultrasound is highly operator-dependent, and it may not be as effective in evaluating the colon compared to CT scans. Additionally, ultrasound has limited ability to assess for complications such as free air or large abscesses, which are crucial in the management of diverticulitis. As clearly pointed out in the American College of Radiology recommendations, when suspecting diverticulitis complications, the use of intravenous (IV) contrast material at CT can improve the identification of bowel wall pathology, pericolic abnormalities, vascular pathology, and intra-abdominal fluid collections.

Different scenarios embrace computed tomography imaging and diverticula, including asymptomatic (diverticulosis) and symptomatic patients (acute diverticulitis, follow-up of acute diverticulitis, chronic diverticulitis). If the role of computed tomography is validated and widely supported by evidence in case of acute diverticulitis, this is not the case of patients in their follow-up for acute diverticulitis or with symptoms related to diverticula, but without acute inflammation. In these settings, computed tomography colonography is gaining consensus as the preferred radiologic test.

### Computed tomography in the imaging of colonic diverticulitis [^1ad18f48]. Clinical Radiology (2004). Low credibility.

Colonic diverticulitis occurs when diverticula within the colon become infected or inflamed. It is becoming an increasingly common cause for hospital admission, particularly in western society, where it is linked to a low fibre diet. Symptoms of diverticulitis include abdominal pain, diarrhoea and pyrexia, however, symptoms are often non-specific and the clinical diagnosis may be difficult. In addition, elderly patients and those taking corticosteroids may have limited findings on physical examination, even in the presence of severe diverticulitis. A high index of suspicion is required in such patients in order to avoid a significant delay in arriving at the correct diagnosis. Imaging plays an important role in establishing an early and correct diagnosis. In the past, contrast enema studies were the principal imaging test used to make the diagnosis. However, such studies lack sensitivity and have limited success in identifying abscesses that may require drainage. Conversely computed tomography (CT) is both sensitive and specific in making a diagnosis of diverticulitis. In addition, it is the imaging technique of choice in depicting complications such as perforation, abscess formation and fistulae. CT-guided drainage of diverticular abscesses helps to reduce sepsis and to permit a one-stage, rather than two-stage, surgical operation. The purpose of this review article is to discuss the role of CT in the imaging of diverticulitis, describe the CT imaging features and complications of this disease, as well as review the impact and rationale of CT imaging and intervention in the overall management of patients with diverticulitis.

Acute left-sided colonic diverticulitis — Alternative imaging when CT is unavailable or contraindicated: Ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be useful alternatives in the initial evaluation of suspected acute diverticulitis when CT is not available or is contraindicated (Strong recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 1C). They may be useful in patients with a contrast allergy or in pregnant patients; ultrasound can be particularly useful to rule out other causes of pelvic pain when the diagnosis is unclear, especially in women, but ultrasound can miss complicated diverticulitis and thus should not typically be the only imaging modality if this is suspected. Ultrasound is user dependent with limited utility in obese patients, and where available, MRI may be better than CT at differentiating neoplasia from diverticulitis.

Diverticulosis and diverticulitis remain common diagnoses in western countries, and the incidence continues to rise. Diverticulitis accounts for roughly one-third of admissions to acute care hospitals annually, with even more patients being treated as outpatients due to improved understanding of risk stratification and the natural history of disease progression. Thus, having a thorough understanding of the etiology of the disease in conjunction with computed tomography findings and patient presentation can help dictate the appropriate treatment.

### Clinical and CT findings in appendiceal diverticulitis [^45a2632f]. Clinical Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

Appendiceal diverticulitis is a rare pathologic entity that is difficult to diagnose on clinical grounds because of an indolent course and atypical presenting symptoms. However, the characteristic computed tomographic (CT) features should suggest the correct diagnosis, and an appendectomy should be performed. Despite its rarity, radiologists should be aware of this condition and the findings on CT because of the higher risk of perforation than in appendicitis and the potential association with appendiceal neoplasms.

### ACR appropriateness criteriaLeft lower quadrant pain-suspected diverticulitis [^b0d870f4]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2019). Medium credibility.

This review summarizes the relevant literature regarding imaging of suspected diverticulitis as an etiology for left lower quadrant pain, and imaging of complications of acute diverticulitis. The most common cause of left lower quadrant pain in adults is acute sigmoid or descending colonic diverticulitis. Appropriate imaging triage for patients with suspected diverticulitis should address the differential diagnostic possibilities and what information is necessary to make a definitive management decision. Patients with diverticulitis may require surgery or interventional radiology procedures because of associated complications, including abscesses, fistulas, obstruction, or perforation. As a result, there has been a trend toward greater use of imaging to confirm the diagnosis of diverticulitis, evaluate the extent of disease, and detect complications before deciding on appropriate treatment. Additionally, in the era of bundled payments and minimizing health care costs, patients with acute diverticulitis are being managed on an outpatient basis and rapid diagnostic imaging at the time of initial symptoms helps to streamline and triage patients to the appropriate treatment pathway. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on emergency department utilization of computed tomography scans of appendicitis and diverticulitis [^4a93c38c]. Emergency Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Few studies have examined how COVID-19 affects the complexity of pathologies presenting to EDs. These studies have shown an increased complexity of pathologies, including appendicitis and bowel obstruction, appendicitis in children, appendicitis and cholecystitis in adults, and acute coronary syndrome. This information indicates that in other hospitals, patients were likely hesitant to enter an ED when they had an acute medical condition. Therefore, instead of seeking medical attention immediately, they waited until their condition deteriorated to a problematic stage. On the contrary, our combined pathology data seems to represent the opposite, with patients who were actively ill proceeding to travel to the ED early in their disease course without hesitation.

From our knowledge, our study is the first to observe an increase in CT abdominal scans with an increase in combined positive rates but no change in complexity of the pathology. We believe the discrepancies shown in our data can be explained by a change in clinical practice due to several factors. It has been shown that in times of infectious outbreaks, physicians tend to change their behaviour and alter their clinical practice. In the beginning of the pandemic there was very little known about COVID-19. The symptoms of COVID-19 were still novel; thus, it was unknown when and if a patient's chief complaint of abdominal pain was a symptom of COVID-19. Recommendations were to investigate individuals with abdominal pain, and reduce the spread of COVID-19. Therefore, using a strong diagnostic tool like the CT scan would be one of the main triaging tools utilized to assess the patient for any serious medical ailments. The practical usage of the CT, with its ability to obtain a wealth of information in a quick, efficient, and non-invasive manner, makes it the ideal method for assessing, and understanding injuries or insults in patients. Additionally, if we break down the pathologies independently into appendicitis and diverticulitis, we see unanticipated results. One would expect an increase in positivity rates for both pathologies, but instead, appendicitis rates continued unabated during lockdowns while diverticulitis rates fell proportionally to the total number of patients in the ED. Once again, we attribute these differences to a change in clinical practice of ED physicians. During times of normal clinical practice, the first-line diagnostic imaging test for a suspected appendicitis is the CT scan; however, ultrasonography (US) is considered an appropriate alternative depending on the clinical picture (i.e. symptoms, and age of the patient). While we did not look at the number of ultrasounds performed, we did observe that during the lockdown the number of CT abdominal scans and positive appendicitis cases did not fall in proportional to the total patients, which coincides with a relative increase in the usage of the CT abdominal scan being preferred. This pattern has been shown in two multicenter cohort studies examining appendicitis during COVID-19, both of which showed an increase in CT imaging and a decrease in the number of US. This further highlights the importance of imaging as an essential tool in a clinical scenario.

Making the clinical diagnosis

When encountering a new patient in the emergency department (ED), the surgeon first makes the clinical diagnosis of diverticulitis based on history, physical exam and routine laboratory testing. Abdominal pain is the primary presenting symptom. It is typically located in the left lower quadrant; however, a redundant sigmoid colon can reach the right lower quadrant and mimic appendicitis. Localized peritoneal irritation can result in guarding and rebound tenderness. Free perforation often presents as frank peritonitis. Fever and leukocytosis are usually present and assist in making the clinical diagnosis. Nausea and vomiting are the most notable symptoms when a stricture results in an obstruction. The initial assessment should include a) an assessment of the severity of the signs of the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) including heart rate, respiratory rate, temperature and white blood cell count, b) peritonitis on physical exam and c) signs of organ dysfunctions. Patients with clinical diagnosis consistent with diverticulitis who have concerning signs of sepsis should be considered to be at high risk for complicated diverticulitis. They should have IV access obtained, be given a bolus of IV isotonic crystalloids (20 ml/kg), be administered IV antibiotics, and be admitted to the hospital.

These patients should undergo CT scanning with IV contrast of the abdomen and pelvis with the exception of pregnant women where ultrasound is recommended. CT scanning has a high sensitivity and specificity in confirming the diagnosis and identifying patients who are candidates for therapeutic PCD. CT scanning also excludes other causes of left lower quadrant abdominal pain (e.g. leaking abdominal aortic aneurism or an ovarian abscess), but is not reliable in differentiating acute diverticulitis from colon malignancy.

### CT of acute abdomen in the elderly [^de464ae9]. Insights Into Imaging (2025). Medium credibility.

The use of unenhanced CT scans offers two key advantages: it simplifies the triage imaging examination and mitigates the risk of potentially severe iodine-related toxicity in elderly patients. This approach has led to significant improvements in diagnostic accuracy and patient management compared to current practices, as evidenced by two retrospective studies focused on patients over 75 years of age. However, a study by Shaish et al, including a population with an average age of 50, concluded that unenhanced CT was approximately 30% less accurate than contrast-enhanced CT in evaluating acute abdominal pain in the ED. In clinical practice, even when non-contrast scans are extensively used, a contrast-enhanced scan may be necessary if the non-contrast scan fails to yield a positive diagnosis. The primary concern lies in the negative predictive value of a so-called normal non-contrast scan for certain diagnoses, such as bowel or gallbladder ischemia. The strategy of analyzing unenhanced CT before performing a potential injected CT requires evaluating each patient when they are on the table in CT suite, which may not be practical in a busy emergency CT unit. However, this is the prerequisite for personalized medicine, i.e. in this specific case adapted to the patient's age, the potential adverse effects of iodine injection and the data from the non-injection CT scan. Therefore, if possible, we recommend a non-contrast scan and an injection of contrast media depending on the results of the unenhanced scan, decided by the radiologist present during the examination. Intravenous injection of contrast medium depends on clinical presumption and results of non-injection CT scan. If ischemia of the small intestine, colon, or gallbladder is suspected, the injection is systematic to assess the enhancement of the digestive or vesicular wall and to look for mesenteric vascular obstruction. If a digestive pathology is identified, such as a mechanical obstruction, the injection will enable the search for complications, such as ischemia, and allow a more precise assessment of the cause of the obstruction. On the other hand, in the case of some diseases, such as uncomplicated appendicitis or uncomplicated diverticulitis identified on unenhanced CT, or in the case of a strictly normal CT scan with no clinical suspicion of ischemia, a CT scan without injection may be sufficient. If there is a gap between a very busy scanner and a scarce radiological resource preventing the radiologist from being present in the CT scan room, an injected scan should be performed straight away. There are valid arguments for preferring not to inject iodine in the elderly: the high prevalence of renal failure and the risk of contrast-induced acute kidney injury (CI-AKI). Chronic kidney disease is common in older people, and its prevalence increases in parallel with age exceeding 25% in patients over 70 years old and the risk of CI-AKI is increased, reaching 13.6% in patients over 65, with a 2.55 pooled odds ratio, as calculated in a met analysis recently published. Further studies are therefore necessary before recommending the systematic use of unenhanced CT for triaging elderly patients with suspected acute abdomen. These studies could be structured around a two-stage research strategy: first, the assessment of the negative predictive value of a normal injection-free CT scan, and second, the conducting of a prospective randomized study, to compare the strategy of a systematic injection-free CT upon arrival at the ED with a conventional strategy, which involves on-demand CT scans, usually with contrast injection.

### The WSES / SICG / ACOI / SICUT / AcEMC / SIFIPAC guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of acute left colonic diverticulitis in the elderly [^3fda7e88]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Statement 2.1 We suggest the use of CT-scan with IV-contrast in all elderly patients with suspected diverticulitis to confirm the diagnosis and to distinguish complicated from non-complicated diverticulitis. [Conditional recommendation, very low-quality evidence]
Statement 2.2 In elderly patients with suspected diverticulitis who cannot undergo CT-scan with IV-contrast (i.e. severe acute or chronic kidney disease or contrast allergy), we suggest the use of US, MRI or CT-scan without IV-contrast as alternative diagnostic approaches, according to resources availability. [Conditional recommendation, very low-quality evidence]

According to the WSES Guidelines in the general population, regarding CT scans of the abdomen and pelvis, this is indicated for all patients with suspected ALCD, but ultrasound (US) may be a useful alternative in the initial evaluation of patients. A step-up approach with CT performed after an inconclusive or negative US may be a safe approach for suspected acute diverticulitis in the general population. US could be used to confirm or exclude other conditions which do not require CT. The reported sensitivity and specificity are 0.95 and 0.96–0.99 for CT scan and 0.90 and 0.90–1.00 for US, respectively. In a meta-analysis by Andeweg et al, the pooled specificity of CT (96% [95% CI 90–100%]) was significantly higher compared with US (90% [95% CI 86–94%] (p = 0.04; OR 2.46; 95% CI 1.01–5.96) and an accurate diagnosis was made in 68% of patients with a CT scan and in 48% with US (p = 0.002, OR 2.6; 95%CI 1.41–4.93). In the study by Nielsen et al in cases of uncomplicated diverticulitis CT scan and US results were not comparable in 17% of cases (no diverticulitis on US in 14% and inconclusive US in 3% of cases) and in cases of complicated diverticulitis they were not comparable in 79% of cases (uncomplicated diverticulitis on US in 34%, no diverticulitis on US in 28% and inconclusive US in 17% of cases). The importance of CT imaging also emerged from the propensity score analysis by Shin et al in which the presence of distant intraperitoneal air on CT was the only significant parameter that correlated with operative management of colonic diverticulitis. Focusing on elderly patients, among the 464 patients older than 80 years presenting to the ED with acute abdominal pain, 55% had positive CT scans and 9% had diverticulitis. The clinical diagnosis obtained was clinically unsuspected prior to CT in 43% (p < 0.05) with significant difficulty in diagnosing of diverticulitis (p < 0.01). Furthermore, CT results influenced treatment plans in 65% overall, surgical in 48% of these and medical in 52%.

Acute colonic diverticulitis is common. Each year, in the United States alone, approximately half a million patients with ACD will present to an Emergency Department, with more than 200,000 hospital admissions required. While the prevalence of ACD increases with aging, particularly in women, there is a notable increase in younger age bands. The vast majority of patients in North America develop left-sided disease, particularly in the sigmoid colon, whereas right-sided disease is more prevalent in other parts of the world such as Asia.

For patients presenting with left lower quadrant abdominal pain, and laboratory evidence of inflammation, which may include an elevated CRP or white blood cell count, the diagnostic evaluation should begin with an abdominal computed tomography (CT). Computed tomography with intravenous contrast is the defacto gold standard imaging modality as it will confirm the diagnosis, exclude concurrent pathology, and provide information on the extent of disease, which is critical to subsequent clinical decision-making. The CT can also be utilized to track the clinical response to treatment. In contemporary practice, the extent of disease visualized on CT is utilized to classify ACD. In particular, careful note should be taken of the location of the diverticuli, as well as the extent of inflammation involving the bowel wall and contiguous structures. The location and characteristics of any associated air or fluid as well as the location, size and percutaneous accessibility of any abscess collections should also be delineated on the index CT.
Multiple contemporary classification systems are available to describe the severity of ACD (Table 1). These classification systems are important for clinical decision-making, documentation of the extent of disease, and research. In general, the classification systems separate patients into those with complicated versus uncomplicated disease. The seminal 1978 Hinchey classification, has been modified, to better incorporate CT findings (Table 1). One of the most commonly cited modificationssubdivides the Hinchey classification into six stages. Stage 0 consists of mild, uncomplicated diverticulitis. Stage 1 is subdivided into Stage 1a, where there is limited pericolic inflammation, and 1b, where there is inflammation with an associated pericolic abscess, confined to the pericolonic region. In Stage 2, there is a distal abscess, which may be located for example in the pelvis or retroperitoneum, away from the area of colonic inflammation. In Stage 3, similar to the original Hinchey description, there is generalized purulent peritonitis, and Stage 4 is characterized by free perforation with feculent peritonitis. The AAST grading system is also frequently cited. Here, Grade 1 is described as colonic inflammation, progressing to Grade 2 with microperforation or pericolic phlegmon without abscess. Grade 3 describes patients with a localized abscess, Grade 4 is characterized by the presence of a distant abscess, and Grade 5 is reserved for patients with a free perforation and generalized peritonitis. Multiple studies have compared the different classification systems for ACD and found them to be similar in their ability to predict the need for procedural interventions, complications and outcomes
For patients with uncomplicated ACD, without evidence of abscess or generalized peritonitis requiring acute surgical or percutaneous intervention, the classic mainstay of treatment included admission for a course of IV antibiotics. The balance of the available evidence however no longer supports admission or the universal use of antibiotics for all patients. In the AVOD trial, which enrolled patients in Sweden and Iceland, 623 patients with acute uncomplicated left sided ACD on CT were randomized to treatment with either antibiotics or symptomatic treatment without the use of antibiotics. There was no difference in the complication or recurrence rate, and antibiotic treatment did not decrease recovery time. Long-term follow-up to a median of 11 years demonstrated no difference between the treatment arms. In the DIABOLO trial,528 patients in the Netherlands with CT-proven acute uncomplicated diverticulitis were randomized to a management strategy of antibiotics or treatment without antibiotics. Those patients treated without antibiotics had a decreased hospital length of stay, and no difference was seen in any of the secondary outcome measures including complications, recurrence, need for surgery or adverse events. Longer-term follow-up out to 24 months demonstrated no difference in complications, recurrence, or need for sigmoid resection. In the DINAMO study,480 patients with ACD were randomized to antibiotics versus symptomatic treatment alone, with no difference seen in the primary outcome measure of hospital admission. A recent meta-analysis of 2505 patients demonstrated that there was a decrease in hospital length of stay when antibiotics were not used, with no increase in the need for additional treatments, complications, or recurrence. One area of controversy is the patient with extracolonic gas visible on CT. In a recent analysisof patients enrolled in the DIABOLO trial, Hinchey 1a patients with extracolonic gas localized to an area < 5 cm from the inflamed area of the colon could also able to be managed successfully without an operation. However, there was insufficient data to provide a recommendation on the need for antibiotics. Overall, while most patients undergoing non-operative management of ACD will not require antibiotics, despite the available data, because of the restrictive inclusion criteria utilized to enroll into these randomized trials, there may still be patients who benefit from receiving antibiotics. This is an individualized decision and will depend on intrinsic patient factors. As summarized by the American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons (ASCRS) statement on ACD, antibiotics should be considered in patients with significant comorbidities, overt signs of systemic infection, or those who are immunosuppressed. Practically, when it comes to the route of administration, if a decision is made to utilize antibiotics, a meta-analysis of 355 patientsreported that oral antibiotics did not result in an increase in treatment failure or recurrence when compared with IV antibiotics. This also facilitates decision-making regarding outpatient versus inpatient treatment. In the DIVER trial,132 patients with uncomplicated acute diverticulitis were randomized to in-hospital versus outpatient treatment. There was no difference in treatment failure rates when treatment was completed as an outpatient. Outpatient treatment was associated with a significant decrease in costs but equivalent measured quality of life. For patients who fail treatment, with or without antibiotics, we recommend repeat imaging to re-evaluate the extent of inflammation, and to examine for the development of complications. For those patients who are successfully managed non-operatively, consideration should be given to post-discharge colonoscopy.
For patients with complicated ACD with an abscess identified on CT, subsequent decision-making centers around the size, and percutaneous accessibility of the collection. While operative source control is always an option, image-guided percutaneous drainage when available, is favored. For small fluid collections, a trial of antibiotics can be attempted. The definition of small varies, but in general 3 cmto 4 cm, is often used as a pragmatic size cutoff. For those undergoing percutaneous drainage, a total course of 4 days of antibiotics are recommended based on the STOP-IT trialresults. For patients who fail percutaneous management, operative management remains an option.
For patients who present with diffuse peritonitis, or, are hemodynamically abnormal as a result of the inflammatory process, operative intervention is required. This may also be the case for patients who do not tolerate a trial of nonoperative management attempt, which includes failed percutaneous drainage of a localized collection. Traditionally, for patients with Hinchey Class 3 or 4 complicated diverticulitis, the operative intervention consisted of a classic Hartmann's procedure. This included a sigmoid resection, with an end colostomy at the index operation, followed by a delayed reconstruction. In the recent past, there have been multiple trials examining surgical options other than a Hartmann's procedure. – The primary comparator to the Hartmann's procedure in these trials was a single-stage colon resection, with primary anastomosis, with or without a protective proximal ileostomy. In the DIVERTI trial, those undergoing primary anastomosis had a higher rate of stoma closure than those undergoing a Hartmann's procedure, with no increase in mortality or complication rate. In a subset of the LADIES trial,133 patients with Hinchey III or IV ACD were randomized to resection and primary anastomosis versus Hartmann's procedure, demonstrating that the stoma-free survival was higher in the primary anastomosis group. In a recent meta-analysis, primary anastomosis was found to be associated with fewer major complications related to the stoma reversal procedure, and patients were more likely to be stoma-free at 12 months. When performing a resection and primary anastomosis for ACD, the need for a protective diverting loop ileostomy proximal to the anastomosis remains a matter of debate. Although there are ongoing trials including DIVERTI 2, at this time, there is insufficient foundation data to make an evidence-based recommendation. Consequently, this decision should be individualized to the patient depending on patient physiologic factors, and the local conditions seen intra-operatively at the time of the operation. If a stoma is created, early reversal when feasible should be considered. In a recent analysis of the National Readmissions Database, the timing of loop ileostomy reversal was examined in 5,757 patients who underwent emergent sigmoidectomy with primary anastomosis for perforated diverticulitis. Early reversal, 6 weeks to 8 weeks after the index operation, was associated with fewer complications, a shorter length of stay, and lower costs compared with late reversal. While resection with primary anastomosis is now the contemporary evidence-based standard for the index operation, for immunocompromised patients, those with significant co-morbidities, malnutrition, or where there are other technical reasons why a higher risk of anastomotic failure may be expected, the classic Hartmann's procedure remains a viable operative option.
ACD patients presenting in a state of hemodynamic instability, in concert with resuscitation and antibiotic therapy, should undergo source control and colonic resection limited to the area of perforation without mobilization of any unnecessary areas of the colon, such as the splenic flexure. In the index operation, an open-abdomen strategy with a planned second look should be utilized. All other surgical steps such as defining the definitive proximal and distal resection margins and stoma creation should be delayed until the patient is better able to physiologically tolerate completion of the procedure.
The role of laparoscopic lavage as the primary surgical treatment option has also been examined in several randomized controlled trials. This is not recommended for patients with Hinchey Class IV feculent peritonitis with ongoing spillage, as these patients have been excluded from the collection of contemporary randomized trials. For patients with Hinchey Class III ACD with purulent peritonitis, theoretically, laparoscopic lavage will allow the surgeon to survey the abdomen, ensure the colonic perforation has sealed, and irrigate the abdominal cavity to decrease contamination and provide source control. This could then bridge the patient to an elective sigmoid resection under optimal conditions, allowing the procedure to be completed in a single stage. When the aggregate data available to date is reviewed, there does not appear to be an advantage to this treatment option and as such, laparoscopic lavage has not been universally adopted as a stand-alone index treatment option. There have been three randomized trials examining this minimally invasive operative option. In the SCANDIV trial, 199 patients with peritonitis on physical examination, and a CT demonstrating free air were randomized to laparoscopic lavage or resection. The resection could be performed open or laparoscopic, with or without primary anastomosis. With a median follow-up of 59 months, there was no increase in mortality, or in severe complications in either treatment arm. However, while there may be a lower rate of stoma formation overall, a recurrence was more likely in those patients randomized to laparoscopic lavage. In the DILALA trial, 83 patients were randomized to lavage versus a Hartmann's procedure during the index operation. There was no difference in the readmission rate, or survival, but the patients undergoing lavage had a lower chance of requiring operative intervention in the 2 years following randomization. Finally, the LOLAarm of the LADIES trial enrolled patients with purulent, but not feculent peritonitis, and randomized them to lavage versus either a Hartmann's procedure or resection with primary anastomosis. The study was terminated early, prior to study completion, due to increased complications, particularly abscess formation, in the lavage arm. Follow-up to 3 years showed that there was no difference in mortality or complication burden however, there may be a lower stoma rate among those undergoing lavage who had survived to that point. A meta-analysis of 589 patients, including 85% with Hinchey III ACD, demonstrated that compared with colonic resection, laparoscopic lavage was associated with a threefold increase in the risk of persistent peritonitis, intraabdominal abscesses and the need for emergency surgery. Another meta-analysis of 294 patients from three RCTs reported that at 3 years, laparoscopic lavage was associated with a significantly decreased likelihood of having a stoma, but an increase in recurrent diverticulitis. The balance of the available data does not support universal application of laparoscopic lavage as a first-line treatment option for ACD. In the 2020 ASCRS guidelines, colectomy is recommended over laparoscopic lavage, citing the higher rates of secondary intervention required. In the EAES and SAGES evidence-based practice recommendations, as well as in the WSES guidelines, laparoscopic lavage is presented as an option for select patients with Hinchey III ACD, provided the expertise is available, along with the ability to closely monitor the patient for what will likely be a higher complication rate and need for re-intervention. As pointed out in a recent review by Biffl et al, following this treatment pathway leads to a decrease in the presence of a stoma in those that survive long-term. This is an option that should be discussed with patients, as many of them have a strong aversion to colostomy. If there is a reasonable chance of resection and primary anastomosis without a diverting ileostomy, this procedure offers no benefit. However, if the goal is to resolve sepsis and bridge the patient to elective resection without an ostomy, minimally invasive lavage may provide a pathway to achieve this goal. It should only be considered for patients who can tolerate the excess complication burden and recurrent infections.

Further, the patients studied were inpatients with uncomplicated disease confirmed by computed tomography (CT); therefore, the results should not be generalized to complicated patients (those with abscesses or fistulas), those with severe infection or sepsis, immunosuppressed patients, or patients with significant comorbidities. Outpatient management without antibiotics has not been studied, although we would expect these patients to have generally milder disease and logically equal or better outcomes.

### Diagnosis and management of acute diverticulitis [^09074bf3]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2006). Low credibility.

Although the diagnosis of acute diverticulitis is somewhat standardized, the scientific evidence and basis for treatment has been questioned. For years, medical and surgical management of acute diverticulitis has been based on the theory that more than 2 significant attacks of diverticulitis would lead to the recommendations of surgical resection. This should be questioned and further investigated with prospective randomized trials. Only a small number of well-published articles support the surgical management with good scientific data. Although our ability to take a history and skill of physical examination has not changed, the use of improved technology such as high-speed computerized axial tomography has afforded us the ability to make earlier and more accurate diagnoses. This may further allow us to standardize treatment and study outcomes. The time has come to further investigate and justify this management. It is possible that only the most critical situations may necessitate an operation. Clearly, the age group less than 40 years, as well as the immunocompromised, steroid-dependent, diabetic, and transplant patients, seem to be at greater risk with increased morbidity if not treated early and aggressively. And those individuals who present with perforation or compromised obstruction most likely will continue to need emergent intervention. We should try to set the rules by evidence-based medicine, while remaining within the confines of excellent and cost-effective care.

### Accuracy of diagnostic tests for acute diverticulitis that are feasible in primary care: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^d6f05e9b]. Family Practice (2024). Medium credibility.

Interpretation of findings

Diagnostic accuracies varied greatly between studies and were low for signs and symptoms. We saw that studies on individual signs and symptoms are scarce. Of the five studies, only three studies evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of signs and symptoms specifically. The inclusion criteria of the studies varied, that is, one study included patients with abdominal pain, while one included patients suspected of appendicitis or acute diverticulitis, and three studies included patients specifically suspected of acute diverticulitis. In addition, two studies excluded patients if they were not referred for imaging. Furthermore, predefined criteria or thresholds (e.g. diarrhoea duration, consistency, etc.), and if the signs and symptoms were self-reported or reported by the clinician were unclear in some cases. In our review, patients with a positive test result (e.g. positive abdominal pain localization RLQ) but diagnosed with, for example, appendicitis, were counted as false positives. However, in clinical practice, these patients require medical treatment or further diagnostic investigations and therefore these results are less harmful to the patient. Also, we acknowledge that assessing a patient is a multivariable process and clinicians will not diagnose a patient solely on one sign or symptom.

Regarding laboratory tests, we found high sensitivities for CRP at a cut-off value of > 10 mg/l, but lower specificities. This suggests that CRP has potential as a triage test for further diagnostic evaluation, as it can effectively rule out acute diverticulitis in patients with normal CRP values (< 10 mg/l). We indicated that the quality of the included studies for CRP was low. This was because two of the studies had patients undergo prior testing since they were selected based on CT request forms. Also, it was unclear whether index and reference tests were performed blindly with regard to the outcome of the other. Another systematic review evaluating predictors of severity of diverticulitis showed that CRP > 175 mg/l is predictive of a more severe disease process with a higher likelihood of complications. Although in guidelines CRP and WBCC are recommended to use in combination or together with signs and symptoms, we did not see a potential for WBCC (cut-off value ranges > 1– > 10 × 10⁹/l).

### Effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on emergency department utilization of computed tomography scans of appendicitis and diverticulitis [^72236aaa]. Emergency Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Another plausible factor attributing to our results is that at the start of the pandemic, NL implemented a virtual care code for family physicians, making primary care more accessible during the public health lockdown. Patients that had diverticulitis previously may have sought their primary providers and received treatment, negating the need to travel to an ED. This would have a two-fold effect as it would decrease the patient load on the ED, and the outpatient care would avoid complicated cases. Without this change, we may have seen more diverticulitis cases within the ED. Finally, the method by which we represented our data is different in comparison to similar studies. We developed a control from the years 2018 and 2019, thus creating a predicted value that we should have observed in 2020 if there was no pandemic. Therefore, the predicted number represents patients that would require a CT abdominal scan if 2020 were a "normal" year, which our pre-lockdown data shows that before COVID-19 it was trending as equivalent. Other papers chose to present their data using different methods, such as the total percent change in patients seen and CT abdominal scans ordered. Consequently, the relative increases in the amount of CT abdominal scans shown in our study might have been equivalents at other centers if their data were shown as compared to normalized trends.

### WSES guidelines for the management of acute left sided colonic diverticulitis in the emergency setting [^2b95b8a8]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Recently Makela et al. published a study which compared the CRP values of 350 patients who presented first time with symptoms of acute diverticulitis with the CT findings and clinical parameters by means of both univariate and multivariate analyses. CRP cut-off value of 149.5 mg/l significantly discriminated acute uncomplicated diverticulitis from complicated diverticulitis (specificity 65%, sensitivity 85%, area under the curve 0.811, p = 0.0001). In multivariate analysis, a CRP value over 150 mg/l and old age were independent risk factors for acute complicated diverticulitis. The mean CRP value was significantly higher in the patients who died (mean CRP of 207) than in those who survived (mean CRP of 139). In addition, a CRP value over 150 mg/l and free abdominal fluid in CT were independent variables predicting postoperative mortality. The study confirmed that CRP is useful for the predicting the severity of acute diverticulitis on admission. The authors concluded that patients with a CRP value higher than 150 mg/l have an increased risk of complicated diverticulitis and should always undergo a CT examination.
4) Computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis is indicated for all patients with suspected ALCD. It has high sensitivity and specificity and can assess the severity of diverticulitis guiding clinicians in planning treatment (Recommendation 1 C).
5) Ultrasound (US) may be a useful alternative in the initial evaluation of patients with suspected ALCD. It has wide availability and easy accessibility. It may have satisfactory sensitivity and specificity when performed by an expert operator. A step-up approach with CT performed after an inconclusive or negative US may be a safe approach for patients suspected of acute diverticulitis (Recommendation 1 C).

### Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on emergency department CT for suspected diverticulitis [^a85a1738]. Emergency Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

This study examined the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on emergency department CT use for acute nontraumatic abdominal pain, to better understand why imaging volume so drastically decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Methods

This was a retrospective review of emergency imaging volumes from January 5 to May 30, 2020. Weekly volume data were collected for total imaging studies, abdominopelvic CT, and abdominopelvic CTs positive for common causes of acute nontraumatic abdominal pain. Two emergency radiology attendings scored all diverticulitis cases independently, and weekly volume data for uncomplicated and complicated diverticulitis cases was also collected. Volume data prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic was compared, using 2019 volumes as a control.

Results

During the COVID-19 pandemic, overall emergency imaging volume decreased 30% compared to 2019 (p = 0.002). While the number of emergency abdominopelvic CTs positive for appendicitis and small bowel obstruction did not significantly change during the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of cases of diverticulitis decreased significantly compared to 2019 (p = 0.001). This reduction can be specifically attributed to decreased uncomplicated diverticulitis cases, as the number of uncomplicated diverticulitis cases dropped significantly (p = 0.002) while there was no significant difference in the number of complicated diverticulitis cases (p = 0.09).

Conclusions

Reduced emergency abdominopelvic CT volume during the COVID-19 pandemic can partially be explained by decreased imaging of lower acuity patients. This data may help formulate future strategies for imaging resource utilization with an improved understanding of the relationship between perceived imaging risk and symptom acuity.

### Accuracy of diagnostic tests for acute diverticulitis that are feasible in primary care: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^a5eb88a8]. Family Practice (2024). Medium credibility.

Results

The literature search yielded 3,230 studies from we included seventeen studies, involving a total of 5,227 adults with suspected acute diverticulitis, of whom 1,470 (28%) had diverticulitis (Supplementary materials 3 and 4). We contacted five authors for additional data and received data from one.

Fifteen studies included patients prospectively and two studies retrospectively. The majority of studies were performed in Europe (twelve studies, N = 4,372, 510 cases), the rest was performed in Asia (two studies, N = 283, 86 cases), and North America (three studies, N = 672, 282 cases), (Supplementary material 4). The prevalence of acute diverticulitis in the populations ranged from 11% to 65% (median 48%, IQR 37–58). All studies were performed in secondary care and the majority were performed at the emergency department (eight studies, N = 3,511, 881 cases). Four studies were performed at the radiology department (N = 433, 233 cases), two studies at the surgery department (N = 976, 166 cases), and in three studies the department was not mentioned (N = 407, 190 cases). Fifteen studies used multiple reference standards, usually a combination of clinical outcomes, surgery, CT, follow-up, and clinical experts. Two studies used CT alone.

Risk of bias

Table 1 presents the risk of bias in the included studies. Ten studies were assessed as demonstrating a high risk of bias in ≥ 1 domains, and fourteen studies scored unclear risk of bias in ≥ 1 domains, (Table 1). High risk of bias in the domain patient selection was related to inappropriate exclusions in two studies. The domain index test was scored high risk of bias in two studies, because the index test results were interpreted with knowledge of the reference standard, or the threshold was not pre-specified. Six studies scored high risk of bias for the domain reference standard since the studies had only used CT as a reference standard, and/or the reference standard was interpreted with knowledge of the index test. Four studies scored a high risk of bias for domain flow and timing because not all patients were included in the analysis, or the time interval between the index test and the reference standard was either too longor too short. Applicability concerns were low in all domains for four studies.,

### A comparison of the accuracy of ultrasound and computed tomography in common diagnoses causing acute abdominal pain [^6b3144a7]. European Radiology (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Of all patients presenting to the Emergency Department (ED), approximately 10% have complaints of acute abdominal pain. Acute abdominal pain can be caused by a wide variety of conditions. Formerly these patients were thought to have a acute abdomen, and surgery was indicated. Nowadays, patients with acute abdominal pain, even if accompanied by abdominal tenderness and rigidity, not all of them will undergo surgery, while others without abdominal rigidity are operated on. Diagnostic imaging is widely used in the work-up of patients with acute abdominal pain. Ultrasound and computed tomography (CT) are both frequently used on top of clinical and laboratory evaluation. The American College of Radiology suggests an abdomen/pelvis CT with contrast medium in patients with acute abdominal pain. Others are in favour of ultrasound as the primary imaging technique mainly because ultrasound is easily accessible and does not expose patients to ionising radiation. Ionising radiation exposure at CT is associated with the risk of radiation-induced cancer. This is a drawback of CT, especially as CT is increasingly being used in the diagnostic work-up of young patients. This may prompt the evaluation of alternative imaging strategies next to CT, such as ultrasound and MRI. However, diagnoses should not be missed or delayed and thus the most accurate imaging technique should be used.

A previous evaluation of diagnostic strategies for unselected patients with acute abdominal pain favoured a conditional CT strategy for the detection of urgent conditions, with ultrasound first and CT after a negative or inconclusive ultrasound. For common diagnoses causing acute abdominal pain, such as appendicitis literature suggests CT in the diagnostic work-up of these patients suspected with appendicitis. Primarily usage of CT in patients suspected with diverticulitis is not supported by literature, as accuracy of US and CT were comparable in a recent published meta-analysis. The fact that ultrasound is observer-dependent is thought to be a major disadvantage. Its accuracy, as reported in the literature, may be overestimated because in a research environment ultrasound is usually performed by highly experienced observers. Ultrasound accuracy could also be lower in specific patient subgroups, such as in obese patients, women, and in specific age groups, especially women of reproductive age. CT, on the other hand has good inter-observer agreement in general, and even excellent inter-observer agreement for frequent diagnoses causing acute abdominal pain (e.g. appendicitis and diverticulitis).

### Acute diverticulitis: key features for guiding clinical management [^0e06f309]. European Journal of Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Diverticular disease of the colon and small bowel is an important cause of pathology leading to emergency department visits and urgent gastrointestinal surgery. CT is a highly sensitive and specific modality for the diagnosis of acute diverticulitis and its complications as well as for the exclusion of alternate causes of pathology. Ultrasound, MRI and virtual CT colonoscopy have important adjunct roles for screening and workup of complications in specific patient populations. While diverticular disease most commonly involves the descending and sigmoid colon, it can also affect the proximal colon and small bowel. Acute diverticulitis may be categorized as uncomplicated or complicated according to the degree of inflammatory changes and related complications it induces, although some degree of overlap exists in clinical practice. Uncomplicated diverticulitis is classically characterized by localized inflammation surrounding a diverticulum ranging from wall thickening and phlegmonous change to the development of small, localized pericolic abscesses. Complicated forms of disease manifest with larger pericolic and distant abscesses, fistulae to adjacent organs, perforation, and peritonitis. Recurrent episodes of diverticulitis may lead to muscular hypertrophy of the bowel wall and luminal narrowing, potentially leading to bowel obstruction. Several imaging features may help to differentiate diverticulitis from colonic malignancy, however this remains a diagnostic imaging challenge that often requires further evaluation with colonoscopy. In this review, we discuss the pathophysiology and key imaging features of acute diverticulitis and its complications. We explore both common and uncommon presentations of the disease involving the colon and small bowel, acute and chronic manifestations of disease, and pitfalls to recognize when imaging alone may be insufficient to distinguish benign from malignant.

### Diverticulitis: a comprehensive review with usual and unusual complications [^2c8aa582]. Insights Into Imaging (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Besides the usual signs and symptoms, in the course of the diverticular disease, several unusual complications may be seen. Pylephlebitis, perforation, intestinal obstruction, abscess and fistula formation may be counted among the unusual complications. MDCT is a very robust imaging tool for the primary diagnosis of the acute diverticulitis and its usual and unusual complications. Although CT is the most commonly used modality, radiologists should be familiar with US findings as sonography is generally the first preferred imaging study in the emergency department. Radiologists should be cognizant of the complex unusual complications of acute diverticulitis as they may require a multi-disciplinary treatment approach.

In any management decisions, patient's preference ought to be considered and some may prefer CT evaluation to minimize any risks of unnecessary surgery. Estimates have indicated that complications can occur in 12% of normal appendectomies. It has been estimated that every 100 CT scans performed for suspected appendicitis prevented 21 unnecessary operations. These statistics have prompted some to recommend routine CT evaluation for all patients who present with suspected appendicitis. Analysis of our recruitment data suggests that such an approach may be preferred by certain patients. During patient recruitment, 107 out of 274 patients refused to participate in the study. Further analysis on the reasons for refusal revealed that more than 80% rejected participation as they were keen for CT evaluation to mitigate the risk of unnecessary surgery.

Despite concerns regarding radiation exposure, CT evaluation is likely to remain as the main diagnostic modality for the evaluation of suspected appendicitis. In our study, CT evaluation established the diagnosis of acute appendicitis, or alternative diagnoses mimicking appendicitis, in 75% of cases. Ultrasound has been proposed as an alternative for initial evaluation and is included in the evaluation algorithm proposed by the World Society of Emergency Surgery. However, it has not taken off in our practice as the findings are operator dependent. Results from a recent meta-analysis have also concluded that the sensitivity and specificity of ultrasound were not superior to that of clinical examination. While magnetic resonance imaging of the abdomen is a reasonable alternative, its rate of a non-diagnostic exam is higher than that of CT. Magnetic resonance imaging is also more costly and less tolerated by patients.

Perhaps, efforts should be dedicated towards making CT evaluation safer rather than trying to replace it. Limited range CT (from top of L2 to the symphysis pubis) has shown promise among the pediatric population with close to 50% reduction in exposed radiation. However, its use may not be feasible in the adult population as several mimicking pathologies such as diverticulitis and upper track urinary infections may not be confined to the pelvis and may hence be missed with limited range CT. Low-dose CT (2–4 mSv) is a more promising alternative with recent studies indicating performance characteristics comparable to those of standard dose CT (8–10 mSv) with less than half of exposed radiation. This may make the routine use of CT evaluation for all cases of suspected appendicitis more palatable for some clinicians.

### Acute colonic diverticulitis [^0526931f]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Acute colonic diverticulitis is a gastrointestinal condition that is frequently encountered by primary care and emergency department practitioners, hospitalists, surgeons, and gastroenterologists. Clinical presentation ranges from mild abdominal pain to peritonitis with sepsis. It is often diagnosed on the basis of clinical features alone, but imaging is necessary in more severe presentations to rule out such complications as abscess and perforation. Treatment depends on the severity of the presentation, the presence of complications, and underlying comorbid conditions. Medical and surgical treatment algorithms are evolving. This article provides an evidence-based, clinically relevant overview of the epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment of acute diverticulitis.

### Caecal diverticulitis can be misdiagnosed as acute appendicitis: a systematic review of the literature [^244e3851]. Colorectal Disease (2021). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

Caecal diverticulitis is a rare condition, which was historically often misdiagnosed as acute appendicitis, therefore resulting at times in unnecessary exploratory surgery. Analyses of different publications starting from 1930 demonstrate that medical imaging took a critical place in supporting the clinician to diagnose this condition and to administer adequate treatment. Imaging should be part of the standard diagnostic management of right sided lower abdominal pain. Once diagnosed, uncomplicated CD can be safely managed with antibiotics. Surgery should be kept for complicated cases only.

Level of evidence: II

Grade of recommendation: C

Consensus: 88.9% (SA 66.7%, A 22.2%)

Initial evaluation of a patient with suspected AD must include a problem‐specific history, physical examination and blood tests, including C‐reactive protein (CRP), to determine severity and prognosis. The diagnostic accuracy of clinical evaluation for AD is low but a symptom triad of left lower quadrant pain, fever and absence of vomiting is suggestive of AD. Urinalysis and a pregnancy test may be helpful in excluding other diagnoses that can mimic the presentation of AD, such as urinary tract infections, ureteric calculi and ectopic pregnancy.

Laboratory tests should include full blood count, renal function, amylase and CRP. CRP can be used as an indicator of the presence of complications in AD: patients with CRP > 150 mg/l have an increased risk of complicated AD; a CRP > 200 mg/l is a strong indicator of perforation. CRP has both diagnostic and prognostic value for patients with AD, and a CRP value higher than 150 mg/l is associated with an increased risk of postoperative mortality if surgery is undertaken. Leucocytosis is also related to complicated AD and risk of surgical intervention, but patients with fever and leucocytosis that resolve within the first 48 h of initiating treatment have improved outcomes.

Uncomplicated AD or Hinchey Stage I disease can almost universally be treated on an ambulatory outpatient basis, with a 6%–10% risk of readmission, very low rates of complications and an opportunity for substantial financial savings, but patient selection is key. For patients selected for ambulatory management, any imaged abscess should be < 3 cm, there should be no signs of systemic sepsis, and patients should be able to tolerate oral intake and have an adequate social support. Risk factors for failure of outpatient management include CT findings of free fluid or extraluminal air, or more than two previous episodes of AD. Patients should be admitted if other risk factors are present such as age > 65 years, significant comorbidities or immunosuppression.

Question 1.3

What imaging should be used in acute diverticulitis?

Recommendation: Contrast‐enhanced CT imaging should be undertaken in all suspected cases of acute diverticulitis in order to confirm the diagnosis, to assess severity and to plan therapy.

### Effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on emergency department utilization of computed tomography scans of appendicitis and diverticulitis [^e75f5fa7]. Emergency Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Our study is the first to examine how the COVID-19 lockdown affected EDs within NL. Overall, during the initial COVID-19 lockdown, from March to June, the EDs in St. John's experienced a significant decrease in the number of patients seen. This decline was irrespective of both age and sex, as a similar decrease was seen across all demographics. Additionally for the 2020 timeframe, there was no change in the CTAS scores that presented to the ED, inferring no change in acuity seen during the lockdown. In contrast, the amount of CT abdominal scans ordered remained relatively consistent during lockdown and did not match the reduction in patient loads. Proportionally higher use of CT scans remained into post-lockdown, July, and August, when restrictions were eased, and patient numbers increased. An increase in the amount of observed combined positive cases was seen over the lockdown with no change in combined complexity rates. However, when examining appendicitis and diverticulitis independently, only observed positive appendicitis rates appeared indifferent to lockdown-related reduction in patient volume, whereas diverticulitis did reduce and returned in proportion to total patients presenting to the ED. This data suggests that despite the lockdown, cases of appendicitis still made their way to the ED and progressed as usual without an increase in complicated cases. The lockdown month of June did show an unusually high number of appendicitis-positive cases compared to previous years but did not have a preceding delay/drop in cases. Therefore, concerns about increased complicated appendicitis cases did not materialize. On the other hand, cases of diverticulitis did not surge, suggesting a backlog or delay of diagnosis was not occurring. Diverticulitis cases appear to show a relationship to lockdown conditions but not due to delays in avoiding ED and CT scans. The complexity rates of diverticulitis remained low and unaffected. The observed difference in the number of CT abdominal scans contradicts our hypothesis. While we predicted an increase in positivity rates, we did not anticipate appendicitis and diverticulitis diverging in their responses to COVID-19 lockdown. Attending physicians may have been reacting to a sense of caution or concern that complicated cases were unaddressed during lockdown, leading to higher CT scan orders post-lockdown, but that risk did not appear to materialize.

Case Summary

A healthy 65-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with a 12-hour history of sudden-onset severe lower abdominal pain. This is her first episode. She reports nausea, vomiting, and anorexia. Her last colonoscopy was at age 60, and was normal, except for diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon. Physical examination is significant for fever, tachycardia, and generalized abdominal pain with rebound tenderness. Pertinent laboratory findings include a leukocytosis and metabolic acidosis. A CT scan is obtained and is consistent with freely perforated diverticulitis, including a thickened sigmoid colon, free fluid in the pelvis, and free air noted near the diaphragm (). The surgeon completes the patient evaluation, recommends initiation of intravenous fluid resuscitation and antibiotics, and plans to go immediately to the operating room for surgical resection.

### Accuracy of diagnostic tests for acute diverticulitis that are feasible in primary care: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^5eb0fdae]. Family Practice (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

This systematic review and meta-analysis was reported in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for a Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Diagnostic Test Accuracy Studies (PRISMA-DTA) Checklist and was prospectively registered in PROSPERO (CRD42021230622).

Search strategy

A systematic literature search was conducted for eligible diagnostic studies in Pubmed, Embase, and Clarivate Web of Science (from inception to 2022 November 2) using Medical Subject Headings, Emtree terms, and free text words related to acute diverticulitis and diagnostic accuracy (Supplementary material 1). The strategy was developed based on a previously published search strategy and in consultation with a medical information expert (central medical library, University Medical Center Groningen). To assure completeness, the references of all included full-text articles were hand-searched by two authors (N.V. M.B.) independently. No language restrictions were applied.

Eligibility criteria

We used five inclusion criteria to select studies for our analysis: (1) the study population consisted of patients over sixteen years of age with symptoms and signs suggestive of acute diverticulitis (e.g. abdominal pain and fever); (2) the study evaluated one or more index tests feasible for primary care, such as individual or combinations of signs, symptoms, routine laboratory tests (e.g. white blood cell count (WBCC) and C-reactive protein (CRP)), or ultrasound; (3) the reference standard for the final diagnosis of acute diverticulitis was CT, colonoscopy, surgery findings (histopathology), and/or findings at follow-up; (4) the target condition was explicitly stated as acute diverticulitis; and (5) the study report, or the subsequent data requested, enabled the construction of a 2 × 2 table. Authors were contacted if data for the 2 × 2 table were insufficient or missing.

We excluded studies that included a population with known acute diverticulitis, healthy controls, studies with fewer than 20 patients, and studies where all reported patients underwent surgery, since this could point to a population consisting mostly of severe diverticulitis cases and their inclusion could introduce spectrum bias.

The CT abdominal scans ordered throughout 2020 were relatively consistent during pre-lockdown. There was a reduction during the lockdown, but it did not proportionally drop to the total reduction of patients presenting to the ED (p < 0.0001), indicating patients whose conditions would normally necessitate CT scans were still presenting to the ED and scans were ordered (Fig. 3). The post-lockdown period showed an increase in CT scans ordered.

The observed combined (appendicitis and diverticulitis) positivity rate (Fig. 4) showed no conceivable difference during pre-lockdown. During early lockdown, from March to April, a reduction in positive cases was detected, with a corresponding surge in positive cases detected in May and June (p < 0.05). However, the rate of complicated cases remained relatively low, if highly variable, without a statistical overabundance in the late to post-lockdown period. Examining positive cases separated into appendicitis and diverticulitis (Table 2) suggested more nuanced and complicated relationships. The total cases of appendicitis did not proportionally drop during the 2020 lockdown and showed significant divergence from the expected proportion of positive patients (p < 0.001). However, positive cases of diverticulitis did reduce throughout the lockdown and appeared proportional to the total number of patients presenting to the ED. Cases of diverticulitis returned to pre-COVID levels following the lockdown (p > 0.05).

Level of evidence: I

Grade of recommendation: B

Consensus: 100% (SA 100%)

Plain chest and abdominal radiographs may provide a diagnosis of perforation or bowel obstruction. Superior diagnostic accuracy for AD is achieved with CT — or sometimes ultrasound (US) in expert hands. CT and US have shown similar sensitivity and specificity for uncomplicated AD. However, although US avoids the risk associated with ionizing radiation, CT is more universally recommended.

Severe abdominal pain, obesity and obscuring bowel gas can preclude a satisfactory US examination and therefore the use of US is limited in complicated AD. Missing a complicated diverticulitis can have important clinical implications and, if diverticulitis is suspected, a contrast‐enhanced CT scan to confirm diagnosis and exclude complications is recommended.

The diagnostic benefits of CT include easier identification of alternative diagnoses assessment of the severity of AD and extent of AD‐associated extra‐colonic abnormalities. The latter include pericolic inflammation (phlegmon or fat stranding), abscess or extraluminal gas or contrast or presence of obstruction, which is more likely to be associated with malignancy than with AD. Historically water‐soluble contrast enema examination may be helpful in assessment of obstructed cases; however, it is inferior to CT in detecting complicated AD, particularly associated abscess, and has fallen out of use. CT is essential for therapeutic planning if abscess drainage is being considered and can be used to grade severity. MRI has high sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing AD and is comparable to CT; however, availability and cost limits its use.

### Diverticulitis: a comprehensive review with usual and unusual complications [^3ef206d8]. Insights Into Imaging (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Diverticulitis is one of the most frequent bowel emergencies presenting with acute abdomen. Acute diverticulitis constitutes 3.8% of causes of abdominal pain in patients presented to the emergency departments. Approximately 10%–25% of patients with known colonic diverticulosis will have diverticulitis in their lifetime. The underlying pathophysiology of diverticulitis is the obstruction of the diverticular ostium by a stool fragment or food particles and subsequent inflammation.

Ultrasonography (US) is generally the first imaging modality used in the evaluation of acute abdomen. In diverticulitis, US demonstrates inflamed diverticulum as a noncompressible outpouching of a bowel wall with thickened and hypoechoic wall often containing an obstructive fecalith at the ostium. Adjacent bowel wall edema and thickening with edematous hyperechoic mesentery can be visualized on US. Gentle compression with US transducers generally induce tenderness and pain. Computed tomography is the mainstay imaging technique in the diagnosis of diverticulitis and its complications. Severity of inflammation, involvement of bowel segment and local and distant complications of diverticulitis can be assessed with CT.

Complications of diverticulitis may be highly variable, and it may be difficult to diagnose diverticulitis as an underlying cause of severe complications. Small sized, well-contained perforations are common in the course of the disease and most cases can be managed conservatively with antibiotics and supportive medical treatment. However, unusual and more severe complications such as non-contained perforation, phlegmon and abscess, phylephlebitis, intestinal obstruction, bleeding, and fistula necessitate intensive management. These conditions should be promptly diagnosed and treated in order to prevent increased morbidity and mortality.

In this review, we discuss the clinical and radiologic findings of small bowel diverticulosis, which is infrequently encountered during practice and far less common than colonic diverticulosis. Small bowel diverticulosis can present with a range of emergent symptomatic complications including diverticulitis, perforation, or hemorrhage. Here, we focus on the clinical features, pathogenesis, radiologic findings, and treatment of small bowel diverticulitis. Although not routinely considered in the differential diagnosis of an acute abdomen, prospective radiologic diagnosis of small bowel diverticulitis is important and can lead to conservative treatment thus preventing unnecessary exploratory laparotomy.

### The WSES / SICG / ACOI / SICUT / AcEMC / SIFIPAC guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of acute left colonic diverticulitis in the elderly [^4334330e]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Several authors have developed clinical scoring systems in order to minimize secondary care diagnostics in suspected ALCD, but these were validated on small sample sizes composed of the general population. Bolkenstein et al. developed a diagnostic prediction model distinguishing complicated from uncomplicated ALCD, validated on 475 patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with a clinically suspected episode of diverticulitis. This model included abdominal guarding, CRP level and leucocytes count. The final model would have avoided secondary care diagnostics in 25% of all patients, with a negative predictive value (NPV) of 96%. Still, the mean age of the tested population was 61 years of age. Many studies have demonstrated that clinical manifestations are insufficient for the diagnosis of ALCD. Longstreth et al. in a retrospective electronic record-based analysis, reported that nearly 5% of patients with severe diverticulitis presented without fever or leucocytosis. In the study by Kaser et al. on 247 patients, if a computed tomography (CT) scan was performed only with a CRP above 50 mg/l, 46 CT scan would have been avoided; however, 12 cases of perforation would have been missed. In this study, patients were not sub-grouped according to the presence of immunocompromising. Van de Wall et al. found that the optimal CRP threshold distinguishing complicated from uncomplicated diverticulitis was 175 mg/l, but 39% of patients with a complicated episode had a CRP below this threshold. Thus, a low CRP does not exclude complicated diverticulitis. Focusing on elderly patients, as previously reported, the clinical presentation of ALCD is more nuanced. Only 50% of patients older than 65 years with ALCD have pain in the lower quadrants of the abdomen, with only 17% having fever and 43% do not have a leucocytosis.

### Small bowel diverticulitis: an often overlooked cause of acute abdomen [^28680cb8]. Emergency Radiology (2010). Low credibility.

We present 3 cases of small bowel diverticulitis ultimately presenting to our Emergency Department over a span of 2 years. Though the final diagnosis was the same, each patient's symptomatology was different, mimicking more common pathologies. Thus, it is important to consider this entity when confronted with signs and symptoms of acute abdomen, especially in the elderly. A missed or delayed diagnosis can lead to costly erroneous studies, incorrect treatments and delay in proper management, resulting in significant morbidity and even mortality. The variety of presentations can often be misleading; therefore, a high index of suspicion is needed on the part of the Emergency Department physician and Radiologist.

### Accuracy of diagnostic tests for acute diverticulitis that are feasible in primary care: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^b55514f4]. Family Practice (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute diverticulitis, which is characterized by inflammation of colonic diverticula, is an increasingly common condition in elderly people, particularly among women and white ethnic groups. Around 20% of those with diverticula will eventually develop it. Most patients with acute diverticulitis have a favourable prognosis and can be managed in primary care. Diagnosing acute diverticulitis clinically can be challenging due to its similar symptoms to a wide range of conditions ranging from irritable bowel syndrome to colorectal cancer.

In the hospital, computed tomography (CT) is recommended alongside patients history, physical examination, and laboratory results to assist in diagnosing acute diverticulitis. CT scans can help reduce the chance of misdiagnosis and discrepancies between the clinical presentation and severity of the condition, by visualizing the location of an inflamed diverticula. However, in primary care, general practitioners (GP) usually rely on simple tests such as signs and symptoms evaluated by patient history and physical examination, laboratory tests, or ultrasound. Diagnostic tests in primary care for acute diverticulitis should have a high sensitivity to ensure that patients with the condition are not missed. This will enable accurate selection of patients for conservative treatment or referral for surgery in patients with high risk of complications while avoiding missing other serious diseases that may mimic diverticulitis.

Although previous studies have evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of tests for acute diverticulitis, no meta-analysis has yet been performed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy specifically of tests that are feasible in a primary care setting. Therefore, the aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of individual signs, symptoms, blood tests, ultrasound, and test combinations for diagnosing acute diverticulitis in patients suspected of acute diverticulitis.

### Implementation of an acute abdominal pain diagnostic pathway in the emergency department [^e26d591a]. BMJ Open Quality (2025). High credibility.

Multicomponent interventions

We carried out a multicomponent intervention to facilitate our SMART aims:

We developed a diagnostic pathway. In November 2023, a clinical pathway was agreed by radiology, general surgery and emergency medicine consultant leads for the project. It was agreed that patients presenting with acute abdominal pain that required advanced imaging had an AP CT ordered by the attending emergency physician and the patient was simultaneously referred to the surgical team on call for review. Patients who presented with abdominal pain but who were deemed not to require further hospital management or advanced imaging were discharged directly from the ED by the emergency team and thereby excluded from this study. The pathway was in part facilitated by the opening of a new CT scanner within the footprint of the ED in 2023.
Protocol for AP CT orders from the ED was rationalised. Previously, all AP CT scans were deemed to require oral and intravenous contrast. International studies which have adopted the intravenous only protocol in EDs (with oral contrast only to be used at the radiologists' discretion) have been shown to reduce ED LOS without compromising clinical outcomes. The new pilot pathway for intravenous contrast only CT imaging for abdominal pain through the ED at Tallaght University Hospital states that an AP CT with intravenous contrast only could be ordered for the following suspected diagnoses and needs surgical review:

Appendicitis.
Diverticulitis.
Small bowel obstruction.
Suspected intra-abdominal abscess.
Acute severe abdominal pain.
Suspected colitis.

Patients who have one of the above suspected diagnoses and had one or more of the following conditions were deemed to require oral contrast also:

Body mass index (BMI) < 25.
History of Crohn's disease.
History of prior bowel resection.

Education of medical staff (emergency medicine and surgical) of the process was used as an intervention. This was done by disseminating details on the new pathway by email to all relevant emergency medicine and surgical staff. The new protocol was also flagged daily at the emergency medicine consultant-led board rounds held on the clinical floor with the ten emergency clinicians on shift in attendance for the week at the commencement of the pathway. A poster detailing the pathway was posted on the wall at the main clinical workstation in the ED.
New AP CT with contrast code was activated on National Integrated Medical Imaging System, so that scans could be ordered without oral contrast and also to highlight new protocol to CT radiographers.

The differential diagnosis for left lower quadrant pain is wide and conditions range from the benign and self-limited to life-threatening surgical emergencies. Along with patient history, physical examination, and laboratory tests, imaging is often critical to limit the differential diagnosis and identify life-threatening abnormalities. This document will discuss the guidelines for the appropriate use of imaging in the initial workup for patients who present with left lower quadrant pain, patients with suspected diverticulitis, and patients with suspected complications from diverticulitis. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

Hence, the importance of performing abdominal and pelvic CT scan with IV-contrast in all elderly patients with suspected ALCD (regardless of the value of leukocytes and of CRP) to exclude other diagnoses and to distinguish complicated from non-complicated diverticulitis, and to promptly plan the correct treatment.

The prevalence of chronic kidney disease in the US is 39.4% of persons aged 60+ years versus 12.6 and 8.5% of persons aged 40–59 years and 20–39 years, respectively. However, the high prevalence of kidney disease among elderly patients should not discourage CT scan execution with IV-contrast, because, usually, a prompt diagnosis and treatment in this frail population may justify the risk of contrast-induced acute kidney injury (CI-AKI).

Even if there is general agreement that chronic kidney disease represents the most significant independent predictor of CI-AKI, especially in the subset of patients with eGFR ≤ 45 ml/min, a recent meta-analysis of retrospective cohort studies of IV radiographic contrast failed to show a higher risk of CI-AKI after CT-scan in patients with chronic kidney disease.

### CT findings in duodenal diverticulitis [^c1dba003]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

Duodenal diverticulitis is a rare complication of duodenal diverticulosis. It is often clinically misdiagnosed because it has no pathognomonic signs or symptoms and its CT findings may mimic other intraabdominal processes. We describe two patients with duodenal diverticulitis who presented with abdominal pain, nausea, and leukocytosis. At the time of initial presentation, only one of the two patients was diagnosed correctly. In the first case, which was initially misdiagnosed as acute pancreatitis, the correct diagnosis was evident only after the disease process had become more quiescent and a follow-up CT scan using orally and i.v.-administered contrast agents was performed. In the second case, the coronal reformatted images confirmed the diagnosis suggested by the axial images.

Conclusion

Duodenal diverticulitis can be a difficult CT diagnosis to make; however, maintaining it in the differential diagnosis of duodenal and pancreatic inflammatory processes and masses as well as defining the anatomy with nonaxial imaging including coronal images may be helpful in confirming the diagnosis.

### CT for acute nontraumatic abdominal pain-is oral contrast really required? [^c9427ba2]. Academic Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Rationale and Objectives

This study aims to compare the diagnostic performance of abdominal computed tomography (CT) performed with and without oral contrast in patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with acute nontraumatic abdominal pain.

Materials and Methods

Between December 2013 and December 2014, 348 adult patients presenting to the ED of a large tertiary medical center with nontraumatic abdominal pain were evaluated. Exclusion criteria for the study were history of inflammatory bowel disease, recent abdominal operation and suspected renal colic, abdominal aortic aneurysm rupture, or intestinal obstruction. All patients underwent intravenous contrast-enhanced abdominal CT on a Philips Brilliance 64-slice scanner using a routine abdomen protocol. The study group included 174 patients who underwent abdominal CT scanning without oral contrast, recruited using convenience sampling. A control group of 174 patients was matched to the cohort groups' gender and age and underwent abdominal CT with oral contrast material during the same time period. The patients' medical records were reviewed for various clinical findings and for the final clinical diagnosis. The CT exams were initially reviewed by a senior attending radiologist to determine the exams' technical adequacy and to decide whether an additional scan with oral contrast was required. Two senior radiologists, blinded to the clinical diagnosis, later performed consensus reading to determine the contribution of oral contrast administration to the radiologists' diagnostic confidence and its influence on diagnosing various radiological findings.

Results

Each group consisted of 82 men and 92 women. The average age of the two groups was 48 years. The main clinical diagnoses of the pathological examinations were appendicitis (17.5%), diverticulitis (10.9%), and colitis (5.2%). A normal CT examination was found in 34.8% of the patients. There was no significant difference between the groups regarding most of the clinical parameters that were examined. None of the examinations of all of the 174 study group patients was found to be technically inadequate, and therefore no patient had to undergo additional scanning to establish a diagnosis. The consensus reading of the senior radiologists determined that the lack of oral contrast was insignificant in 96.6% of the cases and that contrast material might have been useful in only 6 of 174 study group patients (3.4%). The radiologists found oral contrast to be helpful only in 8 of 174 control group patients (4.6%). There was no significant difference between the clinical and radiological diagnoses in both groups (study group, P = 0.261; control group, P = 0.075).

Conclusions

Our study shows that oral contrast is noncontributory to radiological diagnosis in most patients presenting to the ED with acute nontraumatic abdominal pain. These patients can therefore undergo abdominal CT scanning without oral contrast, with no effect on radiological diagnostic performance.

### Effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on emergency department utilization of computed tomography scans of appendicitis and diverticulitis [^9d5fac37]. Emergency Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

The proportional number of CT abdominal scans is opposite of what other ED departments have reported across the world. For example, using machine learning with natural language processing, Li et al. (2021) examined radiology reports for CT abdomen/pelvis, CT abdomen, and CT pelvis from a Massachusetts hospital. They specifically looked for acute appendicitis, acute diverticulitis, and bowel obstruction from January 1st, 2018, to August 14th, 2020. Their results showed a significant decrease in both the volume of CT abdomen/pelvis scans as well as the detection of acute abdominal pathologies. However, they found that the number of scans conducted quickly rebounded back to the historical amount in the months of June and July. This has been a consistent finding in multiple other studies, which have echoed substantial decreases in the amount of CT scans ordered early in the pandemic.

Within the literature, the findings on pathologies have been mixed. Several studies have shown patterns of decreased detection, while others have shown increased positivity rates on appendicitis. For example, O'Brien et al. (2020) found an increased rate for both appendicitis and bowel obstruction, but a decrease in rate for diverticulitis and malignancy. Our results recapitulate the finding of reduced diverticulitis during lockdown and imply behavioural intervention brought on during lockdowns may impact diverticulitis onset. Similarly, examining CT scans of the abdomen and pelvis for all abdominal complaints from two hospitals in Utah, Griffith et al. (2021) reported a 31.6% decrease in CT abdomen and pelvis scans in April 2020 compared to April 2019, while having a higher positivity rate in 2020. However, the only abdominal complaints that were significantly different in 2020 for positivity rate were appendicitis, cholangitis, and colitis, whereas the other 14 abdominal complaints showed no difference between the two timepoints.
