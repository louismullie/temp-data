## Question

Pima invested $400 in Ethereum. In the first week, it gained 25% in value. In the second week, it gained an additional 50% on top of the previous gain. How much is her investment worth now?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how much Pima's $400 Ethereum investment is worth after a 25% gain in week 1 and then a 50% gain in week 2, and wants to see the step-by-step reasoning. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the initial investment and the first-week percentage gain. Then, I should verify how to apply the second-week percentage gain to the new amount, not the original amount. Finally, I will calculate the final value and double-check the math to ensure accuracy.

> Let me first confirm the starting point: Pima invested $400, and in the first week the value increased by 25%, so I need to calculate 25% of $400 and add it to the principal. Wait, let me verify the multiplication: 25% of $400 is 0.25 × 400 = $100, so after week 1 the value is $400 + $100 = $500 [^notfound].

> Next, I should review the second-week gain carefully. The phrasing "an additional 50% on top of the previous gain" means the 50% applies to the current value after week 1, not to the original $400. So I need to calculate 50% of $500, which is 0.50 × 500 = $250, and then add that to the week 1 value to get the final amount. Hold on, I should verify: $500 + $250 = $750 [^notfound].

> I should double-check the overall logic to avoid a common pitfall: if I mistakenly applied the 50% to the original $400, I would get $200 and conclude $600, but that would ignore compounding and misinterpret "on top of the previous gain". Let me reconsider and confirm that the correct approach is sequential compounding, which yields $750, not $600 [^notfound].

> Final answer: Pima's investment is now worth $750 [^notfound].

Pima's Ethereum investment is now worth **$750**. Here's the calculation: after a 25% gain in week 1, the value rises to $400 × 1.25 = $500; then, a 50% gain in week 2 brings the value to $500 × 1.50 = $750. The total gain is **$350**, representing an **87.5% increase** from the original $400.

---

## Step-by-step calculation

| **Step** | **Description** | **Calculation** | **Result** |
|-|-|-|-|
| 1 | Initial investment | $400 | $400 |
| 2 | Week 1 gain (25%) | $400 × 0.25 | $100 |
| 3 | Value after week 1 | $400 + $100 | $500 |
| 4 | Week 2 gain (50%) | $500 × 0.50 | $250 |
| 5 | Final value after week 2 | $500 + $250 | $750 |

---

## Total gain and percentage increase

- **Total gain**: $750 − $400 = $350
- **Percentage increase**: ($350 / $400) × 100% = 87.5%

---

## Conclusion

Pima's Ethereum investment is now worth **$750**, reflecting a total gain of $350 and an **87.5% increase** from the original $400.

2.4 Sensitivity analysis

To assess the robustness of our model and conclusions, we conducted a multiple one-way sensitivity analysis varying the cost per POC viral load test (reducing the cost of m-PIMA to the costs determined for Xpert II and reducing Xpert reagent costs to ensure cost-neutrality with the status-quo) and varying the effectiveness of POC viral load testing in improving viral suppression (+/−50% in the absence of additional trial evidence) and assuming a less than perfect ability of the clinic to target those who are unsuppressed (from 100% to 10% which is conservative given that past viremia is predictive of future viremia). Changing the ability to target a patient with viremia does not change the total number of tests being conducted on POC. It rather assumes that clinicians are only able to target one out of every ten patients who are unsuppressed for POC testing, and that the remaining nine tests are done on patients that do not have viremia if there is sufficient POC capacity (or else referred for centralized testing). This changes the potential effectiveness of POC as the effectiveness of POC is more pronounced if the patient is initially unsuppressed. To assess the interaction of these uncertain parameters, we additionally conducted a probabilistic sensitivity analysis through 1000 Monte Carlo simulations. For each parameter in the one-way sensitivity analysis (excluding the threshold analysis on the Xpert reagent costs), we sampled from a uniform distribution between the high and low value.

### Estimating the monetary value of the annual productivity gained in patients with early rheumatoid arthritis receiving etanercept plus methotrexate: interim results from the PRIZE study [^25e0380a]. RMD Open (2015). Low credibility.

Key messages

What is already known about this subject?
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has a substantial effect on work productivity in the very early phase of the disease.
What does this study add?
This study measures how much productivity patients with early RA gain when on combination therapy with etanercept and methotrexate.
How might this impact on clinical practice?
The combination therapy is associated with a significant productivity gain for patients who remained on treatment at week 52.
Over a 1-year treatment period, early responders at week 13 had significant productivity gains compared with non-responders, which suggests this gain is related to treatment response.

### Is the price right? Paying for value today to get more value tomorrow [^7493ef8b]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

The IRA is a mix of constructive and counterproductive reforms. Reforming insurance to lower out-of-pocket costs for patients makes sense. Subjecting biologics to price controls 13 years after they launch will help ensure that these types of medicines, which do not lend themselves to the same genericization process that renders small molecules inexpensive after patent expiration, abide by the intent of the patent system to see old inventions drop in price. But the aggressive price controlling of small molecule and other drugs approved via the NDA regulatory pathway just 9 years after they launch does not fix any market failure but rather breaks what is already working and therefore merits a rethink.

What then is the role of traditional CEA? Because it seems to be neither comprehensive enough for assessing societal value nor streamlined enough to be a purely budgetary instrument, the utility of traditional CEA is unclear to us. We would argue that the burden of establishing its utility lies with its practitioners. Valuing something is not the same as paying for it. We should appreciate the value of everything precisely so that we do not mistakenly refuse to pay for or invest in something that is well worth having. For example, we must value water even if it is inexpensive so that we do not find ourselves 1 day without it. Similarly, we should value medicines fully even if market-based price competition allows society to enjoy the benefits of many medicines at prices far below their societal value. Traditional CEA omits too much to inform efficient resource allocation and therefore should not remain, in its current form, the accepted HTA tool for making societal resource allocation decisions about innovative medicines, as it is in several leading and influential developed countries.

### Entrepreneurialism in the translational Biologic sciences: why, how, and however [^665a95b5]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2018). Low credibility.

Capital acquisition

There are 2 general strategies for ongoing capitalization of a start-up company. At 1 pole is a strategy typically favored exclusively by some founders and management, which can be characterized as "raise all the capital possible, all the time, from any source". This approach may allow for developing multiple assets, thereby hedging risk of failure of any 1 program. However, the additional capital in-flow dilutes out early stage investors, who may prefer hedging their own risk through single-asset investment in other companies. In addition, this model commits senior management to a continuous cycle of fundraising, which will necessarily be accompanied by less focus on the company's primary business. An alternate model at the other end of the spectrum and favored by some VCs is the capital efficiency model, where investment is typically limited to the initial asset on which the company was founded and financing stages are dependent on valuation step-ups to reduce capital cost. The more realistic and usual approach is typically something in between these 2 extremes. The fact is that scientific founders are usually not in a position to select one model versus another, given the exigencies of fundraising.

Company direction

Once a start-up company is founded and has secured its series A funding, there are a few "good business practices" that deserve mention. The first is that capital is precious, and operations need to proceed on the most parsimonious course that allows for meeting program objectives in a timely manner. The second is that to be successful in the context of finite resources, mistakes in direction or execution must be avoided, which means experienced personnel must be brought into management positions ranging from directors to company officers. The choice of board members is another critical step. Here the blending of multiple backgrounds relevant to the company's mission is the major challenge, followed closely by the choice of individuals with track records of working effectively with others. The board and senior management are responsible for setting strategy, but equally important are the execution tactics that are the major responsibility of mid-level and project managers.

### Navigating independence: the short-term and long-term impacts of USAID dismantling on Somalia's humanitarian and development landscape [^a3da8f24]. BMJ Global Health (2025). High credibility.

For years, USAID has been a cornerstone of life-saving assistance, providing critical funding and operational support across multiple vital areas. A significant cessation or reduction immediately threatens to intensify existing humanitarian crises. USAID's contributions have been vital, with annual investments exceeding US$1.1 billion aimed at supporting food security, health services and emergency aid. The health sector, for example, has been profoundly supported by USAID, which has invested in primary healthcare services, maternal and child health programmes and disease prevention and control initiatives, reaching approximately 3–5 million women and children. Withdrawal will likely lead to gaps in service provision, potentially reversing hard-won gains in combating infectious diseases like measles, malaria, tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS and undermining fragile progress in reducing maternal and infant mortality rates. Similarly, Somalia's precarious food security situation, perpetually threatened by drought, displacement and conflict, has been significantly addressed through USAID's food assistance programmes. These programmes often represent a lifeline for millions, for instance, specific USAID funding announcements aimed to avert famine reached values of over US$400 million in critical periods. A cessation in this aid could exacerbate malnutrition rates, particularly among vulnerable populations like internally displaced persons and children, potentially pushing more Somalis into acute food insecurity and famine-like conditions.

### Value for money of medicine sampling and quality testing: evidence from Indonesia [^ff2033d1]. BMJ Global Health (2024). High credibility.

Implications for policy-makers

Ascertaining the value of postmarket surveillance activities requires policy-makers deciding on its objectives and resources to consider carefully a range of contextual aspects. An important initial distinction is between one-off medicine quality exercises and routine postmarket surveillance. While our cost estimates are based on STARmeds, a standalone study, having these cost estimates inform a discussion on the value of postmarket surveillance in the form of medicine sampling first requires being explicit about what are the policy objectives, what type of study design best serves these objectives (eg, random or targeted sampling) and what 'value' represents in context.

If 'value' refers to the amount and quality of existing knowledge on the substandard medicines prevalence in the respective context, then it can be argued that with absent credible information on the likely extent of the problem, for example, a STARmeds-like type of exercise can offer novel, otherwise unavailable insights that can focus the policy dialogue and serve as a benchmark for future medicine quality efforts. With 'value' understood as knowing the likelihood of a patient buying substandard products, then the substandard point prevalence is determinant since the average cost of detecting one substandard sample was largely determined by the prevalence and laboratory testing costs, as illustrated in our scenario analyses (figure 2). A recent study on the return on investment of technologies to detect substandard and falsified amoxicillin focuses on this issue, and studies the possibility of using more cost-efficient screening alternatives to quality testing, leaving standard quality tests for measuring APIs (such as the high-performance liquid chromatography technology used by STARmeds) for confirmatory tests. As illustrated in scenario C (panel ii), randomised Post-market surveillance (PMS) has diminishing returns to prevalence: the smaller the number of substandard medicines in the market the more expensive and the more difficult it is to find them. One can argue that preventing the existence of substandard medications in the market is a balance between investing in Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) inspection and enforcement, and PMS since effective quality control at production can reduce the need for extensive (and expensive) randomised PMS. In that sense, when there are not enough substandard medicines in the market to justify the cost of randomised PMS, risk-based surveillance might be a better option, which requires a different cost-effectiveness study. On the other hand, countries with a significant number of substandard products should prioritise random PMS. How many substandard medicines constitute a 'significant' amount to justify this view of 'value' of PMS is a trade-off that national regulators need to take into consideration in their planning activities. When 'value' is understood as preventing or deterring substandard products from being brought to the market, the higher the magnitude of this deterrent effect, the higher the value of the postmarket surveillance activity and the lower the expected prevalence of SFM in the market. While, to our knowledge, there is no empirical quantitative evidence on the deterrent effect of medicine surveillance activities, criminological research has found significant deterrent effects associated with the use of surveillance cameras (with random or targeted installation), by increasing the criminals' expected probability of being detected. If postmarket surveillance activities are known to the people and work as surveillance cameras for the medicines market, criminals may be discouraged to produce or sell SFM, just by the existence of these activities. An information experiment increasing the visibility and awareness of surveillance activities in the form of medicine sampling and testing from the market could be useful to investigate the existence and pontetial of this effect. The same would apply if 'value' refers to avoiding adverse events due to SFM: the more cases are avoided, the higher would be the value of postmarket surveillance. Studies estimating the economic impact of SFM have included costs related to adverse events, which could help understand the value of avoiding them, but this evidence is limited to sub-Saharan Africa countries and antimalarials or antibiotics.

### Cost-effectiveness of adoption strategies for point of care HIV viral load monitoring in South Africa [^b9c76ab3]. EClinicalMedicine (2020). Medium credibility.

2 Methods

We developed a geospatial cost-outcome model utilizing existing aggregate data from NHLS in order to assess the cost per outcome for the entire system taking into account facility-level heterogeneity. We used data for all facilities in South Africa that send blood specimens to centralized NHLS laboratories for viral load testing for the 2018 calendar year, including annual viral load volumes; suppression rates (< 1000 copies/ml); specimen rejection rates; turn-around time (TAT) measured from when the specimen is registered at the laboratory until the results are reviewed; and the cost per viral load test by testing platform. We considered different POC adoption strategies: integrating and leveraging 'additional capacity' currently available on instruments in-country; targeting POC test use for certain facilities or to certain patient populations within facilities; and/or prioritizing POC instrument placement at facilities that perform poorly in terms of specimen rejection and clinical action delays.

We included different instruments on the market that perform POC viral load tests; the Xpert® HIV-1 Viral Load (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, USA) ("Xpert") and the newly available m-PIMA™ HIV-1/2 Viral Load (Abbott, USA) (m-PIMA). Whilst the NHLS currently uses 4, 16 or 80 module Xpert instruments for tuberculosis diagnosis, these instruments are located at laboratories and have not been used in a POC setting, nor have they been used for HIV viral load testing in South Africa. Abbott's m-PIMA™ offers the advantage of being better suited to operating in a true POC setting operated by lay healthcare workers, but is typically more costly than the Xpert (Table 2) and only comes in a single module instrument. As such, we assessed the impact of the adoption of these two validated viral load POC technologies, the Xpert and m-PIMA, under four strategies (Table 1).

### Carbon prospecting in tropical forests for climate change mitigation [^ffaa7d37]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Estimating return-on-investment

Based on our map of investible forest carbon, we modeled the relative profitability of investible forest carbon sites to produce a global forest carbon return-on-investment map based on their NPV. We calculated NPV of these returns based on several simplifying assumptions following established values from previous studies.

First, we estimated the cost of project establishment at $25 ha −1. This was based on a wide range of costs that are key to the development of a project, including but not limited to project design, governance and planning, enforcement, zonation, land tenure and acquisition, surveying and research.

Second, we estimated an annual maintenance cost of $10 ha −1, which included aspects such as education and communication, monitoring, sustainable livelihoods, marketing, finance and administration.

Third, we assumed a constant carbon price of $5.8 t −1 CO 2 for the first five years. This price was based on an average price of carbon for avoided deforestation projects recently reported by Forest Trends' Ecosystem Marketplace(i.e. for the period 2006–2018). After the first five years, we assumed a 5% price appreciation for subsequent years over a project timeframe of 30 years.

Based on these criteria, we calculated NPV of annual and accumulated profits over the 30 years, based on a 10% risk-adjusted discount rate.

Separately, we repeated the analysis using a range of starting carbon prices, including $1, $5, $10, $15, $25, $50, $100 t −1 CO 2, based on cost effectiveness thresholds from previous studies. In these analyses, other assumptions remain unchanged, including the project establishment and annual maintenance cost, price appreciation, discount rates and timeframe. Based on these criteria and excluding sites that would be unable to breakeven (i.e. yielding net negative NPVs), we calculated the potential profitable forest areas, as a percentage of the total investible forest areas, associated with these different starting carbon prices.

All values of investible carbon and return-on-investment (based on NPV) were summarized to global, regional, and country level estimates (see Table 1). For countries that extend beyond tropical latitudes, we only analyze and present data for their tropical extents. These values were rounded to the nearest 1000 values.

### The value of the periodic executive health examination: experience at bank one and summary of the literature [^b5367ee2]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

The executive physical examination has been advocated in the United States for almost 100 years. A MEDLINE search of the literature found very few studies that document the potential impact of a worksite physical examination program on medical and disability costs. Bank One has performed executive physical examinations at its corporate headquarters' medical department since 1983. Approximately 65% of eligible executives voluntarily participate in the program annually. Medical claims and short term disability data were available for a total of 1773 executives who were eligible for a physical examination for a consecutive 3-year period. For three consecutive years after the initial physical examination, the Bank paid a total of $5361 for medical claims for periodic health examination participants (PHE) in contrast to $6426 paid for medical claims for non-periodic health examination participants (NPHE). PHE participants experienced an average 0.93 (or 2.78 for 3 years) short-term disability days absent per year in comparison with an average of 1.34 (or 4.02 for 3 years) short-term disability days absent for NPHE. The net return on investment for a worksite-based executive health examination which cost approximately $400 per executive whose total compensation (salary and benefits) is at least $125,000 is estimated to be 2.3:1, which compares favorably with other preventive health programs.

### Effect of escalating financial incentive rewards on maintenance of weight loss: a randomized clinical trial [^93c989a0]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Importance

Identifying effective strategies for treating obesity is a public health priority.

Objective

To test an escalating lottery-based incentive tied to daily self-weighing for weight loss maintenance.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This 2-phase, 2-arm randomized clinical trial enrolled participants aged 30 to 80 years with an initial body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) of 30.0 to 45.0 who lost at least 5 kg during 4 to 6 months in a national online weight management program. Study investigators and outcomes assessors were blinded to participant groups. Data were collected and analyzed from May 23, 2016, through November 13, 2017, based on intention to treat.

Interventions

All participants were advised to weigh themselves daily, with a goal of 6 or more days per week, and received text messaging feedback on their performance. Incentive group participants were eligible for a lottery-based incentive worth an expected value of $3.98 in week 1 that escalated by $0.43 each week they achieved their self-weighing goal during months 1 to 6 (phase 1), followed by no incentives during months 7 to 12 (phase 2).

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was weight change at the end of phase 1. Secondary outcomes included weight change at the end of phase 2 and changes in self-reported physical activity and eating behaviors.

Results

A total of 258 participants (128 in the incentive group and 130 in the control group) had a mean (SD) age of 48.0 (10.5) years and mean (SD) body mass index of 32.1 (3.9); 225 (87.2%) were women; 235 (91.1%) were white; and 102 (39.5%) had an annual income of at least $100 000. Weight measurement was transmitted by 250 participants (96.9%) at 6 months and 227 (88.0%) at 12 months. The percentage of weeks that incentive and control participants achieved a mean self-weighing of at least 6 times was 85.3% vs 75.8%, respectively (P = 0.002) in phase 1 and 37.7% vs 50.2%, respectively (P = 0.009) in phase 2. Mean weight changes at the end of phase 1 were -1.1 (95% CI, -2.1 to -0.1) kg in the incentive group and -1.9 (95% CI, -2.9 to -0.8) kg in the control group, with a mean difference of 0.7 (95% CI, -0.7 to 2.2) kg (P = 0.30 for comparison). At the end of phase 2, mean weight changes were 0.2 (95% CI, -1.2 to 1.7) kg in the incentive group and -0.6 (95% CI, -2.0 to 0.8) kg in the control group, with a mean difference of 0.8 (95% CI, -1.2 to 2.8) kg (P = 0.41 for comparison).

Conclusions and Relevance

Compared with an active control condition of weekly messages, escalating lottery-based incentives transiently increased rates of self-weighing but did not significantly enhance weight loss maintenance.

Trial Registration

### The unique value proposition of pediatric health care [^b94f2768]. Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Principles for payment reforms to incentivize value in pediatric care — payment aims, time horizons, and payer scope are specified. "Payment strategies provide a key pathway toward delivering high-value health care" and this section addresses principles that "should guide payment to ensure value in pediatric care". It recognizes that "much current payment reflects the value proposition for older populations and provides few incentives to achieve value in pediatric care"; the adult value proposition "(investment for short-term savings while maintaining quality)" has driven policy, whereas "the value proposition for children and youth differs substantially from that for adults, in part because much return on investment is long-term and comes in sectors other than health care". "The 3 main payers for health care (employers, government, and families) have shorter-term and medium-term interests in limiting preventable and unnecessary health care expense", and "numerous economic models have demonstrated the significant long-term return on investment of money spent on children". "Expenditures for pediatric care are very small compared with expenditures for adults". Short-term savings from pediatric improvements are "real but relatively modest", including "fewer emergency department visits for asthma and other conditions, fewer hospital or intensive care days for children and youth with complex medical conditions, or improved NICU care", and there are additional gains from "fewer workdays lost by parents who need to stay home caring for sick children".

### Ten-year health impact, economic impact and return on investment of the South African molecular diagnostics programme for HIV, tuberculosis and SARS-CoV-2 [^5b5fb2ad]. BMJ Global Health (2024). High credibility.

These values represent one consistent methodological way to calculate impact, economic value and ROI. There are several changes in the underlying assumptions that might influence the direction of these values in both directions. First, the average GDP per capita in South Africa may not reflect the burden of disease where the health gains occurred for each respective disease (eg, slightly lower burden of disease among higher household social economic index score for TB infection). If including these differences, the economic gains might be slightly overstated where the benefits occurred among individuals with lower annual GDP. We did not, however, want to weight the economic value of health differently among the South African population. In the other direction, within the scope of this analysis, we have only calculated the economic value of the health gains associated with molecular diagnostics rather than the total economic benefit. The total economic benefit likely far exceeds what we have estimated here — for example, the benefits associated with being able to return to work after a negative SARS-CoV-2 test during the pandemic or benefits associated with the reduced frequency of healthcare clinic visits required after a suppressed viral load test — reducing costs to individuals on antiretroviral treatment and possibly increasing economic activity due to fewer days spent seeking care. Estimating the total value was outside the scope of this analysis.

### Physician coaching by professionally trained peers for burnout and well-being: a randomized clinical trial [^ff5a60f1]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

It is important to note that no well-being intervention can stand alone in terms of its purported effect and reach. A coaching program is best suited in a portfolio of evidence-based interventions targeting individual- and systems-level drivers of well-being. Coaching programs offered by health care organizations may serve as individual- and systems-level supports. Coaching may improve the experience of coached individuals, who use these skills within the system in which they work. The use of internal coaches creates a cadre of individuals with unique training and expertise to communicate systems-level challenges identified in their coaching interactions with organizational leadership. For example, physician-coaches have also been involved in group coaching programs for physicians at high risk for burnout and retreats focused on organizational posttraumatic growth in a postpandemic era. When comparing costs of this program with previously published interventions using external coaches, after an initial investment, ongoing cost savings of more than $400 per physician coached were noted. Therefore, despite requiring an upfront investment, this intervention may provide a sustainable approach for an institution.

### Cost-effectiveness of adoption strategies for point of care HIV viral load monitoring in South Africa [^4632a604]. EClinicalMedicine (2020). Medium credibility.

2.3 Cost-effectiveness and budget impact analysis

For each strategy and POC technology, we determined the total cost, effectiveness (defined as the total expected number of people with suppressed viral load (< 1000 copies/ml)) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) based on an expected improvement in suppression rates from POC adoption ($ amount per additional person suppressed). A cost-effectiveness frontier was created to determine the strategies that are more likely to be considered cost-effective at different levels of budget availability.

The expected improvement in suppression from POC adoption were based on the results from the South African-based Simplifying HIV TREAtment and Monitoring (STREAM) POC viral load trial. Using a suppression threshold of < 1000 copies/ml, the proportion of patients virally suppressed was expected to improve by 10·8% for POC viral load tests compared to centralized testing, and by 62% for those previously unsuppressed (the percent change between POC and standard of care for those who were unsuppressed at baseline and who became suppressed, using the threshold of 1000 copies/ml) (Strategy 2). Current levels of viral suppression were adjusted by these factors and multiplied by the number of expected viral load tests to determine the new number of expected people with suppressed viral loads.

The national total cost for each strategy was calculated by estimating the viral load volumes to be tested on each platform (centralized, Xpert and m-PIMA). The average utilization of the platform given its capacity was calculated to determine the associated cost of the viral load test that corresponded to the instrument utilization: lowest costs for the highest utilization and high costs for the lowest utilization. Costs were reported for a 1-year time period and included financial costs from the provider's perspective. All costs included in the analysis are outlined above and reported in Table 2. Additional economic costs and the health and cost impact of different strategies on HIV transmission were not included in this analysis.

### A meta-analysis of the performance of the pima ™ CD4 for point of care testing [^4e9b1fdb]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The sub-study analyses showed no difference in the Pima CD4 performance in a subset of HIV-positive ART-naïve individuals versus the meta-analysis findings. This was also true for the Pima CD4 testing performed by different cadres of operators. In addition to these findings, the subset analysis of the impact of sample size on method comparison parameters determined an average optimal sample size of 280 paired observations (n = 164 for sensitivity and n = 370 for bias calculation) for analyzing CD4 enumeration technologies. This therefore may be a guide to inform future evaluation studies for minimum sample size requirements for different methods of comparison.

While designing and conducting technical evaluations takes time and significant resources, it is critical to ensure that a technology performs comparably to reference standards. This pooled data meta-analysis implies that immunological population differences do not significantly affect the performance of CD4 diagnostic tests, especially in countries within the same geographic region. Performing a technical evaluation in every country considering a new product would, therefore, lead to significant delays in product approval, implementation in health care facilities, and improving the lives of patients. Thus, a harmonized approach could be attained with one large evaluation across sites and pooled data.

### Effect of escalating financial incentive rewards on maintenance of weight loss: a randomized clinical trial [^d3861871]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Primary Weight Outcome

Participants in both groups successfully maintained their initial weight loss during the 6 months of the intervention (phase 1) and the additional 6 months of follow-up after the intervention (phase 2) (Table 2 and Figure 2). The 6-month weight outcome was observed in 250 (96.9%) of the 258 participants in the analysis cohort; the 12-month weight outcome, in 227 (88.0%). In the intention-to-treat analysis, mean weight changes at the end of phase 1 were −1.1 (95% CI, −2.1 to −0.1) kg in the incentive group and −1.9 (95% CI, −2.9 to −0.8) kg in the control group, with a mean difference of 0.7 (95% CI, −0.7 to 2.2) kg (P = 0.30 for comparison). Mean weight changes from baseline to the end of phase 2 (end of study) were 0.2 (95% CI, −1.2 to 1.7) kg in the incentive group and −0.6 (95% CI, −2.0 to 0.8) kg in the control group, with a mean difference of 0.8 (95% CI, −1.2 to 2.8) kg (P = 0.41 for comparison). Analyses adjusted for baseline covariates yielded similar results, with a mean difference between groups in weight change from baseline to the end of phase 1 of 1.2 (95% CI, −0.2 to 2.5) kg (P = 0.09 for comparison) and from baseline to the end of phase 2 of 1.2 (95% CI, −0.8 to 3.2) kg (P = 0.23 for comparison). Using a complete case analysis, results were similar to the intention-to-treat analysis; mean weight changes from baseline to the end of phase 1 were −1.1 (95% CI, −2.2 to −0.1) kg in the incentive group and −1.8 (95% CI, −2.8 to −0.8) kg in the control group; from baseline to end of phase 2, 0.4 (95% CI, −1.0 to 1.8) kg in the incentive group and −0.4 (95% CI, −1.9 to 1.1) kg in the control group. The percentage of incentive vs control participants who maintained their weight (defined as gaining ≤ 1.36 kg) at 6 months was 79.2% (95% CI, 72.0%-86.4%) vs 82.2% (95% CI, 75.3%-89.0%) (P = 0.55 for comparison); at 12 months, 65.4% (95% CI, 56.4%-74.4%) vs 67.8% (95% CI, 59.3%-76.4%) (P = 0.67).

### 2025 AHA / ACC statement on cost / value methodology in clinical practice guidelines (update from 2014 statement): a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^00cf701b]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Cost-effectiveness threshold for U.S. clinical guidelines — the writing committee "recommend the use of $120 000 per QALY as the cost-effectiveness threshold for clinical guidelines", with the threshold to be "periodically reexamined", "not be adjusted annually for inflation", and "revised every 10 years (or sooner…)". Supporting estimates include a 2024 Personal Consumption Expenditure update that "suggests a cost-effectiveness threshold of $117 000 per QALY", a welfare economics approach indicating willingness to pay tied to income ("per capita disposable income of $60 300… approximately $142 000 (range: $120 000-$175 000) for 1 QALY"), and a population-level framework using World Bank data estimating "$95 958 ($81 672-$120 181) per QALY", translating to "$112 000 ($96 000-$141 000) per QALY" after GDP growth; while "no single method… can be considered the 'gold standard'", these three approaches "produced similar results".

### Guide posts for investment in primary health care and projected resource needs in 67 low-income and middle-income countries: a modelling study [^2026352d]. The Lancet: Global Health (2019). High credibility.

Our estimates for the health SDG targets and for the subset of PHC compare in magnitude with global costs for other sectors, such as education (SDG 4), with costs estimated at 8·5% of GDP for LMICs. Although our totals, and relative additional per capita needs, give an overall impression of what remains to be done, resource needs vary across countries, depending on current and future health burdens, and the strength and structure of health systems. What is clear is that major investments need to go into system strengthening, with health workforce and infrastructure development jointly accounting for 53–66% of additional costs within the three PHC measures (appendix p 49).

The results provide evidence on likely cost drivers for PHC and shed light on the premise of affordability across countries. Expanding PHC for all requires an adequate workforce that is well motivated, well resourced, and available where needed, with accessible infrastructure and functioning equipment. We show how health workforces need to increase from 5·6 per 1000 population to 6·7 per 1000 population to support basic functioning PHC systems (measure 1). In low-income countries, this would require an ambitious four-fold increase from a current level of 1·4 health workers per 1000 to 5·9 per 1000. Strengthening health systems and scaling up services under measure 1 would require on average an additional 3·3% of GDP for PHC by 2030. In terms of financing, in a business-as-usual scenario, projected current health expenditure across the 67 countries would increase from an average of 6·1% of GDP in 2020 to 6·6% of GDP in 2030. However, countries with the smallest GDP require the largest incremental investments. Even with a 1% GDP increased allocation towards PHC, almost 25 countries would not reach the modelled benchmarks, which is unfortunate because PHC can be a remarkably efficient and highly equitable investment. Our analysis indicates that notable health gains can be achieved by investing in PHC, with up to 6·7 years gained in life expectancy in just an 11-year timeframe. For an extra $32 per capita, these health improvements have substantial value in themselves, but will also result in improved economic productivity and overall human capital. Furthermore, research shows that PHC is associated with more appropriate, effective, and less costly care. Thus, in theory, resource savings could potentially arise if countries reorient their systems towards PHC (eg, shifting services from tertiary or inpatient care to primary level or outpatient care). Our model does not take into account such shifts, because this kind of contextualised analysis would require in-depth country studies.

### The emergence of cost effective battery storage [^57f497d5]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

For new storage installations in California, investors are eligible for both federal and state-level support programs. At the federal level, battery installations in the U.S. qualify for an Investment Tax Credit, ITC, provided the battery can be classified as solar equipment. Specifically, this requires that the energy storage capability of the battery does not exceed the total energy generated by the solar PV system. As detailed further in Methods, the battery would otherwise only be eligible for a share of the maximum ITC, which amounts to 30% of the acquisition cost.

In addition to the federal support for battery storage systems installed in conjunction with solar PV systems, California has adopted the so-called Self-Generation Incentive Program (SGIP) for behind-the-meter storage systems (see Supplementary Note 8). This program ultimately explains why the majority of residential battery storage systems installed to date in the U.S. are in fact located in California. In its current form, SGIP offers a rebate on the expenditure for energy storage components. Thus it is stated in $ per kWh and effectively reduces the acquisition cost of energy storage components, that is, the parameter v e.

The specific amount to be rebated depends on the duration of the storage system. Normalizing k p at 1 kW, the investor is entitled to a rebate of $400 for the first two kWh of energy storage, an additional rebate of $250 for the next two kWh, and a final rebate of $100 for the next two kWh, up to a duration of 6 h. Additional energy storage components corresponding to the initial 1 kW power rating do not receive any subsidy. For a power component of k p kW, the rebate amounts to $400 for each kWh of energy storage provided the duration of the system does not exceed 2 h. For systems with longer durations, the rebate per kWh steps down as indicated above, such that no additional support is given to systems with a duration exceeding 6 h. These rebates are available in addition to the federal 30% investment tax credit (ITC) for batteries that qualify as solar equipment.

### Turning crisis into opportunity: sustaining COVID-19 gains in resource-constrained and fragile settings [^20aea1a7]. BMJ Global Health (2024). High credibility.

Most countries expressed a desire to maintain capacities developed during the pandemic, but despite important progress there are few concrete national plans to rationalise and maintain those gains. One country noted they will maintain existing gains until the 'funding runs out at the end of 2023', drawing attention to the fact that valuable public health capacities developed during the pandemic, particularly in FCVs/LICs, are at risk because of a lack of prioritisation, planning and funding.

The challenges presented by pandemic preparedness in resource-constrained settings have elsewhere been documented. Here we will highlight four priority actions for sustaining existing gains, focusing on vulnerable contexts. First, support for the integration and institutionalisation of new or enhanced capacities into routine health systems is required. New surveillance sites and laboratories can be integrated into existing systems and networks. New technical units — for example, IPC units — and PHEOCs can be institutionalised within health ministries or other bodies. This integration will foster routine resilience of health systems and better care for patients.

Second, ongoing investment is required to sustain existing gains. This can be sourced through increased financing from domestic sources, bilateral support and inputs from international instruments such as the new Pandemic Fund, which awarded $338 million in its first year. A focus on cementing gains already achieved in FCV, LICs and LMICs would pay huge dividends on investment while supporting health systems and future preparedness. Many of these countries need dedicated financial and planning support to integrate new capacities developed during the pandemic into their national budgets and national action plans.

Third, rational guidance on the rightsizing of new gains is needed. LICs, LMICs and FCVs added many new laboratories, surveillance sites and ICU beds, but maintaining all of them makes little sense from a public health or financial perspective. Having a rational plan for where and how to optimise these gains would prevent a reversion to prepandemic levels.

### Analyses of the return on investment of public health interventions: a scoping review and recommendations for future studies [^e0230949]. BMJ Global Health (2023). High credibility.

Over our review period (2018–2021), we did not observe an increasing trend in the number of ROI studies being published over time. That said, the number of studies published between 2020 and 2021 was likely influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic.

In terms of uses, we found that the ROI metric is being applied in a wide range of study settings and health areas. That said, 47% of the studies were conducted for the USA and 80% of the studies were related to high-income countries. Compared with the findings of a bibliometric analysis of the economic evaluations, the proportion of studies across the different World Bank income settings were similar, but we found a higher proportion of studies relating to the USA (47% vs 35%). This trend could be partly due to the fact that in the USA, the Affordable Care Act prohibits the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute from using cost-per-QALY benchmark to establish what type of healthcare is cost effective or recommended(potentially increasing the reliance on other metrics, such as ROI). A further factor that could be influencing this distribution across study settings is that investment cases for interventions in low and middle-income countries (LMICs) may be published more in the grey literature (such as) and therefore not detected by our literature search. That said, as investment cases become more common, this trend will likely change, and more ROI studies will be conducted in LMICs. The broader reasons and implications of health economic studies being less represented in LMICs are outlined in Pitt et al. Regardless of the setting, this study highlights the need for the development of methodological guidelines and reference cases to ensure the quality and comparability of future ROI studies.

### Calculating the return on investment of mobile healthcare [^505c1bd9]. BMC Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Despite the substantial contributions made by mobile healthcare programs to the US healthcare system, evaluating the efficacy of such programs is currently difficult. Traditional research methods do not fit well in the environment needed to develop successful relationships with the clients of van programs, clients who are often marginalized or homeless or undocumented and almost always untrusting. Successful methods van workers have developed to deal with their clients, for example, the shield of anonymity that is so important to patient engagement, precludes systematic tracking of important data such as ED diversion, follow-up care, and health outcomes.

The MHC industry is at a crossroads of evolving financing strategies similar to that experienced by its healthcare predecessors: hospitals and community health centers. A driving force in this development has been the emergence of the dual imperatives of enhancing access and shifting care to more cost-effective settings. Paralleling this evolution has been a shift from a grant and/or charity-based funding structure to a negotiated exchange of payment-for-services through government and private health insurance and/or subsidies. However, to facilitate this shift in payment models, and thus an appropriate and sustainable funding stream, we must be able to quantify the value of the contributions of the MHCs and to demonstrate the potential benefit of increased investment in this system of healthcare delivery.

We hypothesize that by using published data that quantify the value of prevention practices, an empirical method can be developed to determine the efficacy of mobile healthcare programs. Specifically, mobile healthcare programs annually provide a broad array of prevention services to as many as 4 million otherwise un-served individuals. Recent, ground-breaking research from the National Commission on Prevention Priorities (NCPP) assigned a relative value to various prevention practices in terms of quality adjusted life years saved (QALYS). When combined with research that estimates the value of a statistical life year saved, and applied to mobile healthcare data, the result projects a return on investment (ROI) ratio of at least 30:1, a value both significant and compelling. We believe that this methodology can be enhanced, and applied to mobile healthcare programs across the USA to quantify the value of their current services as well as support the process of prioritization of target populations and interventions that promise the greatest return for healthcare dollars invested. We believe that such a ROI calculator will be an innovative and effective method of quantifying the value of mobile healthcare programs within the US healthcare system.

### ACC / AHA statement on cost / value methodology in clinical practice guidelines and performance measures: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on performance measures and task force on practice guidelines [^5057d50c]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). Medium credibility.

Arguments in favor of incorporating resource and value considerations state that economic evaluations, including cost-effectiveness analyses, can help decision makers appreciate the implications of choices and clarify factors influencing relative benefits, and that economic analyses can guide those making coverage decisions and inform developers of practice guidelines to ensure that recommendations yield the greatest value from available healthcare resources. The document notes that currently algorithms for diagnosis or management of disease states, including appropriate use of clinical interventions, typically consider a broad spectrum of differential diagnoses and patient care approaches, which essentially assume that resources are unlimited, and emphasizes that the principal consideration is not cost awareness but a comprehensive, informed, and evidence-based approach in which incentives are balanced by the need to consume resources more wisely.

### Analyses of the return on investment of public health interventions: a scoping review and recommendations for future studies [^6e40f838]. BMJ Global Health (2023). High credibility.

Implications and policy recommendations related to the use of the ROI metric

We found that ROI analyses are used for multiple purposes within the healthcare sector (including evaluation of cost savings, advocacy/investment cases and as an output of economic evaluations). Although there are important advantages of the ROI metric (such as being intuitive to interpret from a range of stakeholders), it may not always be an appropriate analysis/metric for all of the purposes it is being used for.

We found that currently, ROI calculations of health interventions are using inconsistent methods, and they are often poorly reported. This is not an ideal combination in the context of using these studies to inform policy decisions, particularly when evaluating the value for money of different interventions, as there is always going to be a need to compare different health economic analyses informing resource allocation. Moving forward, to improve the inconsistencies in ROI analysis as well as to ensure proper reporting, it is advisable that guidelines on how to report and conduct ROI analysis are developed. We would recommend that these guidelines should specify that studies explicitly state how the benefits are being valued monetarily, clearly stating if the costs relate to fiscal/tangible benefits or not. This is important given their corresponding use in the business/investment sector and for analysis of fiscal cost-savings, there is a risk that stakeholders could misinterpret the results and assume that studies are reporting fiscal/tangible cost-savings (either to their health system or their society as a whole), when in fact in some studies a large proportion of the estimated economic benefits will not be directly realisable/are non-fiscal. This potential for misinterpretation is an important limitation of ROI analysis. In box 1 we outline proposed recommendations for the reporting of future ROI studies.

### The cost of inaction on health equity and its social determinants [^435eeac7]. BMJ Global Health (2024). High credibility.

Conclusion

The case for closing gaps in SDH is as much moral and ethical as it is economic, underpinned by a value system that does not view human life solely as an engine of economic productivity. The ideas of human capital and human capital utilisation are imperfect — in that, for example, they seem to value health and education insofar as they contribute to labour development as opposed to human development and agency. However, these concepts are critical tools for quantifying the economic decisions and tradeoffs that policymakers grapple with every day — namely to what extent they should invest in SDH.

The impacts of SDH on human capital and health expenditures demonstrate that in the current fiscal environment, investments in SDH are not merely idealistic nor utopian, but practical, achievable and required for economic recovery. According to the United Nation Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), "a return to pre-pandemic austerity will reduce annual global growth by 1% and increase the global unemployment rate by 2% until 2030". On the other hand, significant public investment in equitable SDH, undergirded by international support, could double global growth over the next decade and facilitate a fairer society.

When all impacts of SDH are considered, the economic case for investing in SDH is stronger than before the pandemic and arguably more compelling than the investment case to bailout banks after the financial crash in 2008. But even though it is estimated to require a fraction of the resources used for the bank bailouts (around $3 trillion globally compared with up to $29 trillion in the US alone, respectively), investments in SDH are not being realised and may even go backwards.

The investment case for SDH is necessary, but not sufficient to achieve progress in SDH. Translating it into action will require stakeholder analysis and strategic engagement on the political economy of SDH. But at this inflection point — at which some communities and countries are declaring an end to the pandemic while others continue to suffer the confluence of multiple crises — the investment case serves as a critical tool to communicate that equity in health and its social determinants generate quantifiable returns, not costs, towards collective economic security and growth.

### Considerations of net present value in policy making regarding diagnostic and therapeutic technologies [^a6d01048]. American Heart Journal (2008). Low credibility.

Background

The pharmaceutical and medical device industries function in a business environment in which shareholders expect companies to optimize profit within legal and ethical standards. A fundamental tool used to optimize decision making is the net present value calculation, which estimates the current value of cash flows relating to an investment.

Methods

We examined 3 prototypical research investment decisions that have been the source of public scrutiny to illustrate how policy decisions can be better understood when their impact on societally desirable investments by industry are viewed from the standpoint of their impact on net present value.

Results

In the case of direct, comparative clinical trials, a simple net present value calculation provides insight into why companies eschew such investments. In the case of pediatric clinical trials, the Pediatric Extension Rule changed the net present value calculation from unattractive to potentially very attractive by allowing patent extensions; thus, the dramatic increase in pediatric clinical trials can be explained by the financial return on investment. In the case of products for small markets, the fixed costs of development make this option financially unattractive.

Conclusions

Policy decisions can be better understood when their impact on societally desirable investments by the pharmaceutical and medical device industries are viewed from the standpoint of their impact on net present value.

Figure 1 — comparative value of interventions — categorizes value by clinical net benefit and incremental cost for quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) with intervention versus comparator, where the incremental cost dimension reflects the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio per QALY gained. For favorable clinical net benefit, higher cost corresponds to high value (< $100 000), intermediate value ($100 000 to $200 000), or low value (> $200 000) with the intervention more effective and more costly; lower cost corresponds to high value with the intervention more effective and less costly (cost-saving). For unfavorable clinical net benefit, higher cost indicates no value with the intervention less effective and more costly (cost-dominated), and lower cost indicates no value with the intervention less effective and less costly.

### Practical metrics for establishing the health benefits of research to support research prioritisation [^414596c3]. BMJ Global Health (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Globally, significant resource and effort is spent on health-related research with the 10 largest public and philanthropic funders spending US$37.1 billion in 2013. An important component of this funding is dedicated to basic science and preclinical research. However, much research aims to better understand current epidemiological patterns, healthcare provision and patient outcomes, and how they would be impacted by alternative interventions with a view to informing healthcare investments in the near-term. Clinical trials, surveillance programmes, cost studies, morbidity surveys and implementation studies all serve this purpose. By improving the information available to support investment decisions, they have the potential to improve population health. However, research is costly and those funding research have constraints on their ability to expand research budgets. This raises the question of which research activities should be prioritised.

To answer this question there is a need to understand why evidence is valuable to healthcare systems and the populations they serve, and how to assess the value of specific research proposals. This has been recognised by a number of stakeholders and a set of methods called value of information analysis allow the value of specific research proposals to be quantified. Value of information analysis has been applied in a range of contexts in high-income settings, for example, to assess the value of clinical trials of interventions for which limited evidence exists. Previous studies have also estimated the value of further research in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). These studies used advanced methodsthat require specific types of analyses to have been conducted (probabilistic analyses of a model already addressing the policy question of interest). The application of value of information analysis to help prioritise research has, therefore, been limited as the advanced methods required are often not practical given time and resource constraints, and computation may be impractical where transmission models are required to represent disease dynamics.

### Economic evaluation of cost and time required for a platform trial vs conventional trials [^5eef5c29]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Conclusions

There is a strong case for making the investment in clinical research toward a platform trial where a common infrastructure can be first built and then maintained. With increasing costs of clinical research, this can be an important solution to reduce cost and time without compromising high-quality trial evidence required to determine the most effective therapy for different clinical indications. The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated acceptance of platform trials, but this will not be enough since the current funding models act as a hindrance to platform trials being more widely conducted.

The findings of this study suggest that despite having larger initial setup requirements, consolidating clinical evaluation of multiple interventions into a single platform trial can drastically reduce cost and efforts. There is a need for a shift in thinking that can result in a more collaborative evidence-generation infrastructure with dedicated source funding to carry out platform trials.

Key economic concepts — scarcity, opportunity cost, and efficiency are defined to frame value assessment. Scarcity is foundational: "the most fundamental of which is the concept of scarcity", requiring that "choices, or more precisely trade-offs, must be made", and leading to the notion of cost as "opportunity cost". "The opportunity cost of medical care is whatever else we might desire that cannot be produced because of the decision to produce more health care". Efficiency is highlighted as "A second critical economic concept", with the policy objective to "maximize the well-being (sometimes referred to as utility) of the members of society collectively", and with "Cost-benefit and cost-effectiveness analysis" presented as tools that quantify efficiency of policy choices.

Cost-effectiveness plane (Figure 1) — when a new intervention produces less health and lower costs compared with the comparator, it may be considered cost-effective if the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) is greater than the cost-effectiveness threshold; however, this situation does not arise often because patients, clinicians, and health systems rarely accept worse health outcomes even if it reduces spending, and the figure includes labels "Intervention is cost-saving ("dominant") or always acceptable" and "Intervention is inferior ("dominated") or never acceptable".

### 2025 AHA / ACC statement on cost / value methodology in clinical practice guidelines (update from 2014 statement): a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^39127231]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) cost/value methodology — U.S. cost-effectiveness thresholds and guideline recommendation are as follows: Empirical updates suggest a cost-effectiveness threshold of $117 000 per QALY, with other demand-side approaches yielding willingness to pay of approximately $142 000 (range: $120 000-$175 000) for 1 QALY based on a per capita disposable income of $60 300, and an alternative US estimate of $95 958 ($81 672-$120 181) per QALY corrected to $112 000 ($96 000-$141 000) per QALY. Given the available evidence, the consensus of the writing committee is to recommend the use of $120 000 per QALY as the cost-effectiveness threshold for clinical guidelines, which should be periodically reexamined, should not be adjusted annually for inflation, and should be revised every 10 years or sooner in case of large shocks to the United States health care economy that cause a substantial shift in health care costs.

### Appraising the value of evidence generation activities: an HIV modelling study [^4675ed47]. BMJ Global Health (2018). Medium credibility.

The second stage involves application of a policy response to uncertainty. Under current information, we initially assume that a regional policy operates whereby once the HIV investment strategy has been set and budgets disbursed to regions, the regions must adhere to the intervention budgets allocated. This reflects the fact that recent years have seen a move towards budgets being held locally by decentralised levels of government or non-governmental service providers.

To assess the maximum value of investing in evidence generation activities, we assess the health that could be achieved if current uncertainties were completely eliminated and the values of the model parameters were known that is, the health that could be achieved if we had perfect information. Although in reality further data collection will not resolve all uncertainty, the health generated under perfect information can be compared with the health attained with current information to establish the maximum expected health gains associated with evidence generation activities. This provides the starting point to determine whether additional data collection is worthwhile and whether spending should be devoted to data collection or service delivery.

We then show the impact of the costs of research on the net health benefits of evidence generation activities. These are quantified by comparing the health achieved under current information with the health achieved with perfect information but with a reduced intervention budget (to reflect the resources that must be spent on research). This comparison can be made using different estimates of the resources that must be spent on research. We also estimate the maximum that can be spent on research before it becomes net health reducing that is, the monetary value of research. This can then be used as a benchmark to compare to the costs of the research to determine whether the research is potentially worthwhile.

Finally, we examine how the budgetary policy, by modifying the health attained under current information, impacts on the health benefits of evidence generation. We examine two alternatives to the regional policy response: the national policy and the contingency fund policy, which alongside the regional policy are intended to represent the spectrum of approaches operating in countries in sub-Saharan Africa.

### Cost-effectiveness analysis and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios: uses and pitfalls [^ff53a0ec]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2004). Low credibility.

Cost-effectiveness analysis is a formal method of comparing alternative medical interventions with regard to their resource utilization (costs) and outcomes (effectiveness). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio is an informative measure generated from such an analysis and represents the ratio of the difference in cost between two medical interventions to the difference in outcomes between the two interventions. Thus, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio summarizes the additional cost per unit of health benefit gained in switching from one medical intervention to another. Although incremental cost-effectiveness ratios have limitations, when used in the proper context, these ratios serve as one of the important tools needed to help guide decisions about allocating scarce resources across competing medical programmes.

### Incorporating economic evidence in clinical guidelines: a framework from the clinical guidelines committee of the American College of Physicians [^fd292751]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

American College of Physicians economic evidence — economic outcomes in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are defined as patient outcomes with direct or indirect monetary value related to health care utilization or people productivity; data elements include cost of interventions in U.S. dollars, health care utilization such as emergency or office visits, hospitalizations, length of hospital stays, and cost of care delivery, and loss of productivity such as caregiving, working days, and disability, with sources limited to primary RCTs selected according to guideline key questions and PICOTS definitions.

### Appraising the value of evidence generation activities: an HIV modelling study [^ea81336f]. BMJ Global Health (2018). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This work provides practical insights into the population health consequences of uncertainties in the evidence supporting healthcare decisions and the policy levers available to mitigate these. We show that the collection of further information to reduce uncertainty at the point at which the HIV investment strategy is being developed and budgets assigned has the potential to improve population health. Indeed, guidance issued by the WHO and UNAIDS emphasises detailed collection of epidemiological data as an essential first step for informing the strategic direction of resources. We show that robust data can both improve the design of the investment strategy and the likelihood that any planned investment strategy will actually be implemented. However, it is insufficient to quantify the potential health gains associated with improved data. Evidence is costly to generate, so the health opportunity costs imposed by investment in research rather than service delivery must be calculated to determine if research investments will result in a net improvement to population health. Finally, we show that the health benefits of research will depend on the budgetary policy in place. The value of evidence generation is higher when restrictive budgetary policies are in place as these policies reduce the population health attained under current information. This study used a case study in HIV but the findings are general to all situations in which resources are allocated to healthcare programmes and there is uncertainty relating to the costs and effects of those programmes. Although other studies have demonstrated the utility of methods for evaluating the value of evidence generation activities in the global health setting, these studies have not attempted to incorporate decision makers responses to cost under-runs or over-runs, which can have important implications for how evidence generation activities are valued. The methods presented show how quantitative appraisal of evidence generation activities can be conducted. These methods can be used to support more accountable decision-making among organisations charged with allocating limited funds to primary data collection efforts (eg, trials, surveys) and secondary data analysis.

Resource utilization (intervention cost) thresholds — The CGC reviews the distribution of costs required to provide an intervention for each guideline topic and judges whether there are meaningful differences in resource utilization among available interventions based on the distribution. The CGC does not use a predefined threshold across topics; ethical and equity considerations, clinical aspects of disease severity, and magnitude of clinical net benefit inform judgments. The CGC acknowledges that differences in resource utilization do not address all components of CEAs, and the cost of an intervention is not the sole determinant of value; high-cost interventions can have high value, and low-cost interventions can have low value.

Circulation (2014). Medium credibility.

Limitations, challenges, and arguments against incorporating resource and value considerations — barriers and gaps are described, including variability in value across settings, integration of long-term costs, and lack of national consensus, while noting hopes for routine cost-effectiveness assessment and acknowledging system-level changes are not addressed. Barriers include "widespread unwillingness to acknowledge that resources are limited, distrust of government and other policy decision makers, and lack of confidence in the science of value determination (cost-effectiveness)". Value "is not constant; it may vary over time and from one location to another", and integrating "long-term costs" like infrastructure into per-treatment costs is challenging. "In the United States, no national consensus has emerged regarding the role of cost-effectiveness considerations in healthcare decision making", but "the writing committee… will encourage routine assessment of cost-effectiveness", and it "recognizes" that a focus on individual procedures "does not address system changes that may improve efficiency of cardiovascular care".

### It is money that matters: decision analysis and cost-effectiveness analysis [^2d761fad]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2003). Low credibility.

Clinical decisions must be made, often under circumstances of uncertainty and limited resources. Decision analysis and cost-effectiveness analysis are methodologic tools that allow for quantitative analysis and the optimization of decision-making. These methods can be useful for decisions regarding individual patient evaluation and treatment options or in formulating healthcare policy. We overview the methodology of expected value decision analysis and of cost-effectiveness analysis, including cost-identification, cost-effectiveness, cost-benefit, and cost-utility analyses. Examples are provided of these methods and a user's guide to cost-effectiveness analysis is outlined.

### Cost-benefit analysis of a regional poison center [^99272a87]. Clinical Toxicology (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Funding poison center (PC) operations has become a major challenge nationwide. Increasingly, state and federal budget cuts have resulted in diminished funding to PCs.

Objectives

In an effort to demonstrate the value of current PC phone services, a cost-benefit analysis of a regional center was completed.

Methods

A telephone survey was used to collect data from PC callers during an 8-week period in 2004. Callers with human exposure poisonings determined by the PC to be of minimal or no risk were asked to complete the phone survey. Callers were asked their alternative plan if the PC staff had not been available to assist them. Benefits were measured as healthcare charges potentially avoided.

Results

A total of 652 caller surveys were completed. The benefit-to-cost ratio was 7.67 (95% C. I. 6.83, 8.50).

Conclusion

In addition to non-monetary benefits, the operation of a regional poison center provides significant positive return on investment.

### Rapid development of an integrated network infrastructure to conduct phase 3 COVID-19 vaccine trials [^e8e08db6]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Conclusions

The COVID-19 pandemic caused over 400 million cases and 6 million deaths in just 2 years. Within weeks of the start of the crisis, the US government leveraged industry, government, and academic resources toward the study of COVID-19 vaccines and monoclonal antibodies in diverse populations worldwide. This effort leveraged the expertise of existing research networks, established a joint DSMB, deployed 5 phase 3 clinical trials with harmonized end points, and ultimately led to the successful completion of multiple studies and FDA-authorized vaccines in less than a year. Large sample sizes were feasible during the pandemic and contributed to the achievement of end points and large safety data. This cross-platform approach led to harmonization of data collection across trials and the ability to analyze data from all studies, a novel approach that will continue to yield answers to pressing questions and help guide public health policy. Importantly, this success can be replicated for other important research initiatives and serve as a standard for future clinical studies. Investment and use of this collaborative cross-platform model will continue to provide answers to pressing COVID-19 questions and serve as a model for future pandemics.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Coupling performance measures with economic value — The current approach bases class of recommendation on the strength of clinical evidence and does not consider the intervention's economic value, whereas the economic value statement explicitly considers incremental cost-effectiveness. The authors propose continuing this separation for now, but state it is plausible that future economic value assessments may inform class of recommendation, with the Class 1 designation reserved for interventions with strong clinical evidence of health benefit that are also cost-effective at the accepted threshold. For Class 2 recommendations, economic value assessment may help determine whether an intervention receives a Class 2A designation (meets the cost-effectiveness threshold) versus a Class 2B designation (does not meet the cost-effectiveness threshold).

### Financial incentive strategies for maintenance of weight loss: results from an internet-based randomized controlled trial [^596b3659]. Nutrition & Diabetes (2018). Low credibility.

Participants were considered at goal each day their transmitted weight was equal to or less than their goal weight for that week. Participants in the direct payment condition were eligible to receive US$2.80 each day their transmitted weight was at goal. For example, a participant who chose a weekly goal of −0.5 lb a week and succeeded in achieving their goal weight each day for 12 weeks would earn US$2.80 for 7 days a week for 12 weeks for a total of US$235. Participants in the lottery condition were eligible for a chance to win a daily prize each day their transmitted weight was at goal. Eligible lottery participants had an 18 in 100 chance of winning US$10 and 1 in 100 chance of winning US$100 for an expected value of US$2.80 per day. For example, a participant who chose a weekly goal of −0.5 lb a week and remained at goal weight each day for 12 weeks might win the small lottery 14 times and the large lottery once for a total of US$240. If a participant's lottery number was chosen but the participant did not transmit a weight or weight was above goal that day, a text message was sent indicating that the participant would have won the lottery if requirements had been met, an approach designed to induce anticipated regret and increase motivation. The monetary amount of US$2.80 per day was based on prior research demonstrating efficacy for weight loss.

In both incentive conditions, participants received their winnings via check every 3 months. The amount participants actually received depended on their in-person weight measurement at 3 and 6 months, respectively, relative to their goals. In other words, a participant 100% of the way toward the goal received the full winnings, but a participant 50% toward the goal received 50% of the winnings. For the direct arm example participant above who chose the −0.5 lb goal for 12 weeks, the expected weight loss would be 6 lbs; if the participant's in-person weight at the 3-month time point was only down 4 lbs, the participant would receive 4/6ths or 75% x US$135 = US$101.25. All participants were allowed to keep the scales and were compensated up to US$160 for participation in the study (US$30 for the visit at 3 and 9 months; US$50 for the visit at 6 and 12 months).

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

AHA/ACC cost/value methodology — health outcomes and quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) use notes that "the health outcomes of an intervention relative to the comparator may be a change in the incidence of clinical events… or change in survival (ie, life years gained)", and that the QALY "is calculated by multiplying the health-related quality of life associated with a health state with the time spent in that state". Health-related quality of life is "measured on a scale from 0 to 1, where 0 represents death and 1 represents perfect health". For preference weights, those "elicited from a representative sample of fully informed members of the community are generally preferred", though "some experts have argued that economic and ethical principles support the use of quality-of-life estimates elicited from patients who are directly affected by the condition". Important limitations include that higher baseline quality-of-life gains "generate more QALYs than an equivalent gain in survival" in lower-baseline groups, which "translates to a comparatively higher valuation" and raises concerns about exacerbating health disparities, and the assumption of indifference between quality-of-life versus longevity changes yielding the same net QALYs, "which is often not the case". Alternatives "including the 'equal value of life-years gained' and the 'health years in total'" have "not been uniformly adopted by major health technology assessment agencies"; "cost-effectiveness thresholds have not been established for some of these newer metrics", and results using them are "not directly comparable to the results of studies that report incremental cost per QALYs gained". The statement adds that "economic value statements should incorporate findings from available CEAs that measure health outcomes in terms of QALYs and life years".

### Expectations of reward and efficacy guide cognitive control allocation [^e35d3a12]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

The amount of mental effort we invest in a task is influenced by the reward we can expect if we perform that task well. However, some of the rewards that have the greatest potential for driving these efforts are partly determined by factors beyond one's control. In such cases, effort has more limited efficacy for obtaining rewards. According to the Expected Value of Control theory, people integrate information about the expected reward and efficacy of task performance to determine the expected value of control, and then adjust their control allocation (i.e., mental effort) accordingly. Here we test this theory's key behavioral and neural predictions. We show that participants invest more cognitive control when this control is more rewarding and more efficacious, and that these incentive components separately modulate EEG signatures of incentive evaluation and proactive control allocation. Our findings support the prediction that people combine expectations of reward and efficacy to determine how much effort to invest.

### Straight talk with… mark sculpher. interview by kate ravilious [^db00a5e3]. Nature Medicine (2012). Excellent credibility.

By 2014, the UK will be changing the way it regulates the price it pays for medicines. Currently the country's National Health Service (NHS) uses the Pharmaceutical Price Regulation Scheme (PPRS), which controls the maximum profit a drug manufacturer can make on the basis of capital investments the manufacturer has made. A review of this system, carried out by the UK Office of Fair Trading in 2007, recommended that, instead, medicines should be priced according to the therapeutic benefits they offer to patients-an idea known as value-based pricing (VBP) that has similarities to systems already used in smaller countries such as Australia and Canada. This pricing scheme has been embraced by the UK government, and negotiations on how the system will work are due to begin this month. A British switch to VBP could have ripple effects throughout the global pharmaceutical industry. Even though the UK's share of the world drug market is relatively small-just 3%-drug prices in the country are important because a quarter of national governments reference British values to determine their own sticker prices. One of the most influential thinkers on the UK's proposed system is health economist Mark Sculpher, director of the Programme on Economic Evaluation and Health Technology Assessment at the University of York. As a regular advisor to the UK National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) and former chair of a task force on methods guidance for economic evaluation at the agency, Sculpher has had an instrumental role in guiding value-based decision-making in the country's healthcare system. Kate Ravilious met with Sculpher at his office in York to discuss the value of VBP.

### The world needs to prepare now to prevent polio resurgence post eradication [^5417ecd1]. BMJ Global Health (2022). High credibility.

The solution

Learning from existing financing mechanisms, there is an opportunity to establish a simple solution without disrupting existing procurement mechanisms. A clearer, longer-term outlook on future demand can be established to ensure timely investment in production of IPV stand-alone and IPV-containing hexavalent vaccines.

This new solution can both provide adequate incentives for existing manufacturers and create the conditions to enable new entrants, thereby promoting greater competition and better prices. Planning to avoid shortages in 2026, when GPEI expects eradication to be achieved — requires urgent action now.

The proposed mechanism is an advance volume guarantee. A group of donors would assure a guaranteed, multi-year purchase of a minimum number of doses at a price that would be derived from publicly available international agreements with international purchasers.

The guarantee does not entail any initial fiscal outlay — the mechanism would only pay out if demand falls below agreed levels up to a certain agreed maximum volume. For example, if the demand in a given year were for 400 million (mn) doses rather than the predicted 500 mn, the payout to the supplier would be calculated for a percentage of the 100 mn doses based on their market share. Of course, given public projections of likely demand, the expected demand will exceed supply and there will be no payout. However, the existence of the guarantee provides suppliers with the certainty that if demand is lower than predicted, they will be compensated for their investment.

The guarantee mechanism is not intended to generate additional revenue; it is a transitory way of addressing the tender-manufacturing timeline mismatch by guaranteeing demand until the market is robust and predictable enough to justify investment on its own. For polio, it will assure that post-eradication supply needs are met without disruption, which should happen by the end of the decade.

Parallel action will also be required by implementing countries, donors and development finance institutions to assure sustainable financing for routine immunisaion (RI).

### Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on initial weight loss in a digital weight management program: a natural experiment [^709269da]. Obesity (2021). Medium credibility.

METHODS

Participants were WW digital members in the United States who joined during the first 30 weeks of 2020 as well as those who joined during the same time period in 2019. Participant characteristics are described in Table 1. Weight change (percentage) and self‐monitoring (in‐app tracking of weight, food, and activity) data were assessed during the first 4 weeks of WW membership. Four‐week weight loss was chosen as the outcome because weight loss during the first month of a behavioral weight loss program is predictive of long‐term weight loss. All data were self‐reported as entered into the WW app. Data from weekly cohorts were analyzed independently (i.e. weight loss for members joining in Week 1 of 2020 was compared with weight loss for members joining in Week 1 of 2019). Members who logged their weight during their first week of their membership and entered a subsequent weight in weeks 3‐5 were included in the analysis. Weight from week 4 was used as the follow‐up weight, when available. If a member had missing weight data for week 4, weight data from week 5 were used. If neither were available, weight data from week 3 were used. If weight was not reported in weeks 3 to 5, then the member was excluded from the analysis. The data included in the analyses were normally distributed. Weight loss outliers were identified and removed using thresholds calculated on weight loss percentage: low (25th weight change % percentile − 1.5*interquartile range [IQR]) and high (75th weight change % percentile + 1.5*IQR). Using these criteria, only 2.5% of the data were considered weight loss outliers, equating to approximately ≤ −9.3% weight loss and ≥ 3.3% weight gain in 4 weeks. We compared the excluded outliers sample to the remaining sample and found some differences, including outlying members on average were 3 years younger than nonoutliers (42.5 years old vs. 45.5), more likely to be male (14.5% vs. 11.0%), and had higher start weights and BMIs, likely due to misentering weights (11.9 kg heavier at first weigh in and 3.5kg/m 2 higher BMI).

Baseline demographics

Because of the large sample sizes, p values were not calculated. Instead, significant differences were defined as meeting the criteria for Cohen's convention for a small effect (d ≥ 0.2).

### 2025 AHA / ACC statement on cost / value methodology in clinical practice guidelines (update from 2014 statement): a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^68cfa501]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Cost-effectiveness thresholds — framework and updates explain that the 2014 ACC/AHA statement provided per–capita GDP–based thresholds such that an intervention with an ICER < $50 000 per QALY gained should be considered high value, $50 000 to < $150 000 (1-3x per capita GDP) per QALY gained should be considered intermediate value, and ≥ $150 000 per QALY gained should be considered low value. The World Health Organization's program suggested that costs less than 3 times the national annual GDP per capita per disability-adjusted life year averted should be considered cost-effective, whereas costs less than 1 times should be considered highly cost-effective; however, experts have argued this approach lacks theoretical justification, and World Health Organization experts now also advise against the use of per capita GDP-based cost effectiveness thresholds and instead suggest considering cost-effectiveness information alongside other contextual information in a transparent multicriterion decision process. The writing committee reviewed alternative approaches, including relying on US-based studies; for example, a health opportunity cost analysis estimated that at 2019 prices, for every $1000000 increase in health care expenditures 1860 persons were projected to become uninsured with 81 QALYs lost due to mortality and 15 QALYs lost due to morbidity, implying a cost-effectiveness threshold of $104 000 per QALY ($51 000 to $209 000 per QALY) in 2019 US dollars, and in the probabilistic analysis 40% of the simulations suggested the threshold was less than $100 000 per QALY.

Budget impact in economic evaluations — Budget impact refers to the effect of adopting the intervention on total health care expenditures, accounting for both increased spending due to intervention-related costs and downstream savings from improved health in the treated population, and high-quality evaluations typically report changes in intervention-related costs, the cost of cardiovascular care (for example, savings from averted major adverse cardiovascular events), and the cost of noncardiovascular care (for example, increased spending due to prolonged survival). The budget impact is directly proportional to the number of eligible patients who receive the intervention, with studies typically reporting the projected effect on health care spending if all eligible patients were to receive the drug, and because budget impact may inform strategies for adoption at a population level, this information may be included in the supporting text accompanying the economic value statement where available.

### Cost-effectiveness of possible future smoking cessation strategies in Hungary: results from the EQUIPTMOD [^7850b58a]. Addiction (2018). Low credibility.

The EQUIPTMOD

The EQUIPTMOD is a Markov‐based state‐transition model that was developed in Microsoft Excel to evaluate various polices regarding tobacco control and smoking cessation interventions, and has been described elsewhere in more detail 15. Markov models are used in health economics to model the changes in patients' health states over time 16, 17. Markov models place patients into discrete and mutually exclusive health states. The EQUIPTMOD uses three Markov states: current smokers (both daily and occasional smokers), former smokers and death.

As interventions are implemented, the smokers who are assumed to make a quit attempt in the subsequent 12 months may stop smoking. In subsequent cycles of the model, the balance of some former smokers relapsing and some current smokers quitting is reflected by the background quit rate. Over time, individuals in the cohort may develop smoking‐related diseases (coronary heart diseases, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, stroke and lung cancer). They are also subject to higher age‐ and gender‐specific mortality compared to non‐smokers, because their risks are also affected by their smoking habits. Each cycle is 1 year long, and the model calculates the utility values (based on EQ‐5D mean scores), costs of interventions and costs of the treatment of smoking‐attributable diseases. Additionally, the model calculates population‐weighted average costs and quality‐adjusted life years (QALYs). Costs and outcomes are calculated per cycle then summed and discounted by the predefined discount rate (3.7%) at various time horizons, i.e. 2, 5 and 10 years and life‐time (maximum age 100 years). The EQUIPTMOD provides estimates of costs and benefits of various smoking cessation interventions and allows comparisons between various investment scenarios. There are three main investment scenarios available in EQUIPTMOD, as follows:
Zero investment scenario (or the baseline) represents the theoretical gross cost of tobacco use if all ongoing financial investment in interventions and policies were cut immediately. This baseline scenario provides a benchmark against which to compare the impact of current and prospective interventions.
Current investment scenario (or current practice) represents the estimated amount of money that is being spent actively on tobacco control interventions (including smoking cessation services) this year. One can thus compare the delivery of the current level of investment to the zero investment scenario to determine the ROI of the current practice.
Prospective investment scenario represents the potential future level of funding required to deliver interventions when user‐defined changes are made to the current practice. This new collection of interventions is referred to as the 'prospective scenario', and this scenario allows one to determine the potential ROI of making amendments to the current provision of services.

### Economic evaluation of cost and time required for a platform trial vs conventional trials [^2631816b]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

When the cost and time were broken down to the initial interventions (interventions 1–5) that were available at the beginning vs subsequent interventions (interventions 6–10) that could be added to the platform or be evaluated independently, we still observed higher cost and duration in conventional trial scenarios. For the evaluation of the initial interventions, scenario 2 had a smaller magnitude of relative differences against the platform trial in both cost and time than scenario 3. The median (IQR) increase in trial cost for the scenario 2 was 28.0% (5.5%-50.1%) and 158.4% (136.9%-184.1%) for scenario 3. The median (IQR) increase in trial duration was also smaller for scenario 2 (36.1% [30.8%-41.5%]) than scenario 3 (526.3% [429.4%-657.9%])

For the subsequent interventions, we assumed that they could either be added into the platform trial or be evaluated independently using 2-group trials in either of the 2 conventional trial scenarios (Figure 4). Compared with the platform trial, the median (IQR) increase in costs for conventional trials was 12.6% (2.1%-22.6%), and 226.7% (206.8%-246.7%) for trial duration. The magnitude of the relative differences in cost and time were smaller for the subsequent interventions than the initial interventions because the platform trial had fewer active groups after starting off as a 6-group trial.

### The online metacognitive control of decisions [^76c87917]. Communications Psychology (2024). Medium credibility.

Online MCD: optimal control policy

We now augment this model, by assuming that the MCD controller re-evaluates the decision to stop or continue allocating resources, as value representations are being updated and online confidence is changing. This makes the ensuing oMCD model a reactive extension of the above "purely prospective" MCD model, which relieves the system from the constraint of effort investment pre-commitment.

Letbe the current time within a decision. For simplicity, we assume that there is a linear relationship between deliberation time and resource investment, i.e.: whereis the amount of resources that is spent per unit of time. We refer toas "effort intensity". By convention, the maximal decision time(the so-called temporal horizon) corresponds to the exhaustion of all available resources. This implies thatbecause we consider normalized resources amounts.

Now, at time, the system holds probabilistic value representations with modesand variance. This yields the confidence levelgiven in Eq. (2) above, where we have made confidence an explicit function offor mathematical convenience (see below).

This confidence level can be greater or smaller than the initial confidence level, because new information regarding option values has been assimilated since the start of the deliberation. Of course, the system will anticipate that investing additional resources will increase its confidence (on average). But this may not always overcompensate the cost of spending more resources on the decision. Thus, how should the system determine whether to stop or to continue, in order to maximize the expected cost-benefit tradeoff? It turns out that this problem is one of optimal stopping, which is a special case of Markov Decision Processes. As we will see, it can be solved recursively (backward in time) using Bellman's optimality principle.

American College of Physicians Clinical Guidelines Committee (CGC) — discussion on integrating economic evidence explains that the CGC aims to improve health and health care by providing clinicians with recommendations based on the best available evidence and includes evaluating the cost of care, assessing the value of an intervention, incorporating economic evidence into recommendations, and discussing corresponding clinical considerations; it highlights limitations of cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs), noting that willingness-to-pay thresholds commonly used in the United States do not reflect clinical, social, individual economic, and inflation considerations, economic evidence is sparse and poorly reported in the United States and analyses from outside the United States have low applicability, the certainty of economic evidence is often limited due to dynamic pricing and modeling assumptions, industry funding of CEAs is common and results cannot be easily repurposed in quantitative meta-analytic syntheses, many CEAs rely on surrogate outcomes and analyze medications individually rather than by class, and certainty in CEA results should be based on critically appraised certainty of clinical benefits and harms and model credibility.

### Dyslipidemia management in women of reproductive potential: an expert clinical consensus from the National Lipid Association [^67a456f7]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2024). High credibility.

Estimated calorie needs during pregnancy and lactation — healthy pre‑pregnancy weight: For women with a healthy pre‑pregnancy weight, estimated increases compared to pre‑pregnancy needs are Pregnancy: 1st trimester ↑ 0 calories, 2nd trimester ↑ 340 calories, 3rd trimester ↑ 452 calories, Lactation: 1st 6 months ↑ 330 calories, and Lactation: 2nd 6 months ↑ 400 calories. These estimates apply to women with a healthy pre‑pregnancy weight, and women with a pre‑pregnancy weight that is considered overweight or obese should consult their healthcare provider. For lactation calculations, the first six months are estimated by adding 500 calories/day then subtracting 170 calories/day, and the second six months by adding 400 calories/day with weight stability assumed after six months postpartum.

### Effects of in-person navigation to address family social needs on child health care utilization: a randomized clinical trial [^f6084bd1]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

We did find a differential effect of the navigator intervention vs active control on pediatric hospitalization. Conceptually, the mechanism for this effect is intuitive: decreased social risks may help families prioritize healthy behaviors, such as nutritious food or physical activity, or decrease unhealthy exposures, such as mold. However, work by Berkowitz et alsuggests that the pathways through which reducing social risks improves health outcomes may be nonlinear. Our study does not clarify the pathways through which the intervention operated. Future research is needed to explore how addressing social needs contributes to changes in health and health care utilization.

Our study findings showing differential intervention effects on children's acute care utilization patterns should inform health systems' calculations on the return on investment of different social care programs. Although the navigation intervention may take more resources to initiate and sustain compared with the provision of written resource guides, it may nonetheless result in a higher return on investment, especially considering that the average cost of a nonbirth pediatric inpatient hospitalization is $13 400. However, future cost-effectiveness analyses are needed to inform this potential investment.

Since this study was conducted, the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has drastically changed how clinical and social care are delivered, at least temporarily. It is important to note that while the navigator intervention did offer the option of in-person meetings, it also consisted of telephone and email follow-up options. While providing the navigator intervention solely via telephone or email would need to be assessed before drawing conclusions about its efficacy, future work should explore this, given that it would allow navigators to connect with patients during periods that require shelter-in-place policies.

### Comparison of research spending on new drug approvals by the National Institutes of Health vs the pharmaceutical industry, 2010–2019 [^aaedb714]. JAMA Health Forum (2023). High credibility.

Comparing NIH and Industry Investments

DiMasi et alestimated average industry spending on 106 drugs approved from 1990 to 2010 at $1.5 billion or $2.8 billion with a 10.5% cost of capital (inflation-adjusted to 2018). Using different methods, Wouters et alreported an average industry spending on 63 drugs approved from 2009 to 2018 of $374.1 million, (95% CI, $301.9 million to $464.2 million) or $1.6 billion (95% CI, $1.27 billion to $1.89 billion) with a 10.5% cost of capital.

Spending from the NIH per approval for 81 first-to-target products was significantly greater than reported industry spending on 63 drugsbefore accounting for clinical failures, cost of capital, or discount rates (difference, −$1998.4 million; 95% CI, −$3302.1 million to −$694.6 million; P = 0.003) or with accounting for clinical failures (difference, −$1415.8 million; 95% CI, −$2731.4 million to $100.2 million; P = 0.04) (Table 3). Spending from the NIH was not less than industry spending when industry costs were estimated with clinical failures and a 10.5% cost of capital, and NIH spending was estimated with clinical failures and either a 3% discount rate (difference, −$1435.3 million; 95% CI, −$3114.6 million to $244.0 million; P = 0.09) or a 7% discount rate (difference, −$2436.3 million; 95% CI, −$4782.1 million to −$90.5 million; P = 0.04) (Table 3). Investment from the NIH and the industry was not significantly different when industry spending was estimated with clinical failures, prehuman costs(30.8% real costs), and a 10.5% cost of capital, and when NIH costs were estimated with clinical failures and either a 3% discount rate (difference, −$393.8 million; 95% CI, −$2120.5 million to $1332.9 million; P = 0.65) or 7% discount rate (difference, −$1394.8 million; 95% CI, −$3774.8 million to $985.2 million; P = 0.25) (Table 3).

### Guide posts for investment in primary health care and projected resource needs in 67 low-income and middle-income countries: a modelling study [^a863adf2]. The Lancet: Global Health (2019). High credibility.

Validation process

The approach to define PHC measures was discussed with country representatives and global health policy and modelling experts in a meeting in Geneva on Sept 24–27, 2018. Participants included international experts and academics, as well as representatives from 12 LMICs whose population jointly accounts for more than 48% of the population in the 67 countries covered in the model. Country-specific data inputs used for the modelling were reviewed and validated by country participants during the meeting, as well as through follow-up correspondence. Data were provided by country participants for the most recent year available.

Developing PHC investment guide posts

Investment guide posts are derived from our model for costs, outpatient visits, and health workforce. The estimates are generated by country-specific models but are aggregated and presented as average estimates by income level and country type. Guide posts are a partial measure, covering only the modelled interventions. Here, we present them as conceptual measures for future assessment and monitoring purposes.

Projected costs for PHC are presented as additional and total per capita estimates (panel). The additional amounts represent what is required to advance health service delivery beyond current levels of investment, assuming that current levels of investment remain at a constant level.

Panel
Constructing investment guide posts for total primary health care (PHC) expenditure

Total PHC cost per capita is calculated as the sum of estimated current PHC expenditure plus the additional amount estimated through our analysis. Current PHC expenditure is estimated by applying option 5 from van de Maele and colleagues, which includes general outpatient care, medical goods, and a share of administration costs. Data on current spending was available fromin 2016 US$ for 45 low-income and middle-income countries. We deflated estimates to 2014 US$ using country-specific price deflators. Results are presented as population-weighted average values by country group.

Expenditure estimates on PHC from health accounts only include recurrent expenditures, since expenditure on capital goods is reported separately within health accounts and no proposed methods exist for separating out the PHC share of capital investments. Therefore, our investment guide posts for total PHC expenditure per capita are underestimated, because current expenditure is limited to recurrent costs only. Given the important role of investment in health infrastructure and equipment to improve geographical accessibility and quality of care, we advocate for future measures to include more complete reporting on capital expenditure for PHC.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Cost-effectiveness analysis perspectives — Table 1 delineates cost components and examples by perspective (Health Care Sector, "Modified Societal", Full Societal). Components and examples include health care costs paid by third-party payers (drug/device costs, hospital services, physician services, home care services, allied health), costs paid out-of-pocket by patients (drug copayment/coinsurance and user fees), patient-time costs (time spent seeking care), unpaid caregiver-time costs (time spent in caregiving), and productivity losses (formal/informal labor earnings lost, cost of unpaid lost productivity due to illness, cost of uncompensated household production). Broader sectors listed include social services, housing, legal or criminal justice, education, and environmental. Footnotes instruct that analysts should attempt to capture all relevant costs from a societal perspective and describe a "modified" societal perspective that includes some societal costs, such as patient time and lost productivity, but excludes costs from other sectors of the economy.

### Use of clinical trial characteristics to estimate costs of new drug development [^e9bccc0c]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

In this economic evaluation using a novel approach and after cost of capital and discontinued product adjustments, we estimated a median R&D cost of $708 million across a cohort of 38 drugs, with a considerably higher mean cost ($1.31 billion) driven by a small number of high-cost outliers. Mean R&D costs were 26% lower when excluding just 2 drugs. Reliable R&D cost estimates are essential to assessing the appropriateness of incentives for innovation (like government-granted monopolies from patents and regulatory exclusivity) and returns to drug developers. Given these highly skewed costs per new drug, median, rather than often-used mean, expenses may better reflect the typical case for the purposes of policy discussion.

Our work makes a methodological contribution in demonstrating a new way to estimate R&D costs per new drug. Our approach allocates all of firms' R&D costs reported annually to the SEC, including early research, fixed, overhead, and marketing-focused R&D costs often omitted or imputed by assumption in other studies, onto a similarly broad firm-level total of annual patient-months. Cost per patient-month estimates serve as a flexible building block with application to other drug cohorts and in approximating R&D costs for government-sponsored development programs. While encompassing a wider set of R&D costs compared with most other studies, our mean and median per-drug R&D costs are within the range of other studies published over the past 20 years (with means from $539 million to $2.8 billion).

Weak recommendation, moderate-quality evidence (2B): Evidence from randomized controlled trials with important limitations (inconsistent results, methodologic flaws, indirect or imprecise), or very strong evidence from observational studies; Best action may differ depending on circumstances or patients' or societal values. Higher quality research may well have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate. Weak recommendation, low or very low-quality evidence (2C): Uncertainty in the estimates of benefits, risks, and burden; benefits, risk, and burden may be closely balanced; Evidence for at least one critical outcome from observational studies, case series, or from randomized controlled trials with serious flaws or indirect evidence; Other alternatives may be equally reasonable. Higher quality research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may well change the estimate.

### Use of clinical trial characteristics to estimate costs of new drug development [^945e3485]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Importance

Despite their importance to patients, health, and industry, the magnitude of investments in drug research and development (R&D) remain nebulous. New policies require more granular and transparent R&D cost estimates to better balance incentives for innovation and returns to developers.

Objective

To estimate per-drug R&D costs using a novel, reproduceable approach and to describe firm-level R&D costs per discrete unit of R&D activity (1 patient-month).

Design, Setting, and Participants

This economic evaluation used cross-sectional data to estimate 2014 to 2019 costs per patient-month. Costs per patient-month were calculated using data from 268 US publicly traded drug developers, contributing 1311 firm-year observations, that were highest ranked by assets or market capitalization, after exclusions. Per-drug costs were calculated from all R&D activity through approval for a cohort of 38 new drugs approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2019. Data were analyzed from January 2022 to July 2024.

Exposure

R&D activity, measured in terms of clinical trial patient-months.

Main Outcomes and Measures

This study used a 2-step approach to estimate R&D costs, first allocating firm-year-level total R&D spending across similarly aggregated patient-months, and then aggregating these incremental costs to estimate drug-level R&D costs per new drug.

Results

Among 268 developers assessed, 20 large firms accounted for 80.8% of all patient-months and had 27.4% lower mean and 26.7% lower median costs per patient-month compared with other firms. Each 1% increase in patient-months was associated with a 0.9% increase in R&D costs. R&D costs per new drug were highly skewed, with a lower median (IQR), at $708 million ($247 million to $1.42 billion) than mean (SD), at $1.31 ($1.92) billion, after adjusting for the cost of capital and discontinued products. Without these adjustments, direct costs per new drug were a median (IQR) of $150 ($67.6-$453) million and a mean (SD) $369 of ($684) million. While estimated R&D costs varied in sensitivity analyses, mean costs were always substantially greater than median costs.

Conclusions and Relevance

This economic evaluation found median per-drug R&D costs toward the lower end of the range from prior studies, with a mean closer to the middle of the existing range despite the broad scope of included costs. These findings suggest parallel development across indications, adjustment for discontinued products, and a small number of expensive development programs are particularly important drivers of R&D costs.

### Incorporating economic evidence in clinical guidelines: a framework from the clinical guidelines committee of the American College of Physicians [^537f28fa]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Clinical Guidelines Committee (CGC) value thresholds for economic evidence in cost‑effectiveness analyses categorize interventions by incremental cost‑effectiveness ratio (ICER) per quality‑adjusted life‑year (QALY) gained as high value when cost‑saving or < $100 000, intermediate value at $100 000-$200 000, low value at > $200 000, and no value when dominated. The CGC states these thresholds are those most commonly referenced in U.S.-based cost‑effectiveness analyses, may be adjusted on a topic‑by‑topic basis, and that an intervention is dominated by strict dominance or extended dominance.

### 2025 AHA / ACC statement on cost / value methodology in clinical practice guidelines (update from 2014 statement): a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^362144cd]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

AHA/ACC cost/value methodology — therapies requiring a value statement: Consistent with the 2014 cost/value clinical practice guidelines, we suggest that clinical guidelines include economic value statements about all interventions for which economic evaluations of adequate quality are available, including preventive, diagnostic, and therapeutic strategies, and approaches to health care delivery relevant to the clinical guidelines. The decision about whether an economic value statement is appropriate should rely on the judgment of clinical and economic experts on the guideline writing committee, taking into account the clinical and population health relevance, cost, and available evidence. To the extent feasible, guideline committees should consider including economic value statements for: 1) interventions that receive Class 1 and 2A recommendations in the clinical guidelines, and 2) interventions for which an understanding of economic value is likely to influence adoption. An example of the latter would be an intervention that is expected to substantially impact total health care spending, either because it has a high cost or because a large number of individuals are likely to be eligible. When high-quality economic evaluations are scarce, economic value statements may highlight evidence gaps that can be addressed in future research (eg, indeterminate economic value due to a small number of studies). The first step in developing economic value statements is a review of the literature and consultation with subject matter experts in the field to identify all economic evaluations relevant to particular clinical guidelines.

### Investing in late-stage clinical trials and manufacturing of product candidates for five major infectious diseases: a modelling study of the benefits and costs of investment in three middle-income countries [^a4230909]. The Lancet: Global Health (2022). High credibility.

The economic gains of investing in clinical trials and local production in India amount to $102·1 billion over the 16-year timeframe. The benefit–cost ratio for India is high — each $1 dollar invested would return $66·56. The benefit–cost ratios in Kenya and South Africa are lower than in India but still high: for every $1 dollar invested in trials and manufacturing the return would be $20·51 in Kenya and $33·27 South Africa.

Under the domestic scenario, 8·62 million deaths and 328·48 million DALYs would be prevented (table 3). The benefit–cost ratio for India amounts to 27·82. In South Africa, the benefit–cost ratio under the domestic scenario is 2·85, a significantly smaller economic return compared with the regional scenario. 1·22 million deaths and 60·77 million DALYs would be averted in South Africa (table 3). In Kenya, the benefit–cost ratio is 0·73, a benefit–cost ratio less than 1. The number of averted deaths amount to 0·42 million and DALYs to 19·78 million in Kenya (table 3).

According to our second modelling perspective, the country perspective, over 16 years, investment needs range from $215·42 million in Kenya, to $227·94 million in India, and $383·42 million in South Africa (table 4).

Table 4
Costs of investing in clinical trial and manufacturing capacity (2021–36) from a country perspective

Economic and health benefits accruing from the perspective of the governments of the middle-income countries are shown in table 5 (as described in the Methods section, the health benefits do not differ from those of the societal perspective). Under the regional scenario, the benefit–cost ratio for Kenya was 8·78 and 11·88 for South Africa. The benefit–cost ratio in India is 60·71, and is thus also lower compared with the societal perspective.

### Medicines with one seller and many buyers: strategies to increase the power of the payer [^81af00b9]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Some countries are increasingly interested in developing tiered or differential pricing, whereby different prices are charged to buyers according to their income levels. In theory, it offers the possibility of simultaneously increasing profits and expanding access to a medicine for a larger population. Several criticisms have been raised about tiered pricing, particularly the potentially arbitrary nature of determining tiers, whether it will improve access in lower income countries or small markets, and the lack of transparency or public input into pricing primarily set by sellers — a phenomenon known as price discrimination.

An alternative case has been made for expensive medicines offsetting longer term costs, leading to the development of value based pricing. Value based pricing follows the principle that price should reflect the value to the buyer rather than the actual costs of production plus a margin. It has emerged as a way of agreeing what will be considered during negotiations. Two stages are common: firstly, an agreement of what is included in the value assessment and secondly, how it is valued. Definitions of value can vary across stakeholders and contexts, however, with some arguing that the design of such models can be manipulated to demonstrate a desired outcome. Some countries have experimented with permitting several prices for a single medicine with multiple indications according to the value of each indication. Others, such as Germany, account for such potential differences in value across indications by setting its price according to an average weighted by the population treated in each indication. This strategy, however, may disincentivise applications for new indications with minimal added benefit over comparators, instead relying on off-label prescribing or reformulation of medicines.

Pooled procurement, or joint purchasing, can reduce the power of a monopoly. This allows several buyers to agree to purchase certain medicines exclusively through the group. Joint purchasing increases buyers' power because it provides access to several markets and increases the volume of product included in the tender. Pooled procurement has been shown to reduce the price of medicines drastically and improve access globally and regionally as suppliers and buyers both benefit from economies of scale. For example, the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States Pharmaceutical Procurement Service negotiated an average cost savings of 37% for 25 selected pharmaceuticals over a five year period (1998–2002). Pooled procurement is not a perfect solution, however, as constraints owing to differences in national process or legislation may need to be resolved before implementation and may exceed the expected savingsor lead to unintended consequences for the supply.

### 2025 AHA / ACC statement on cost / value methodology in clinical practice guidelines (update from 2014 statement): a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^63fa1003]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Cost-effectiveness thresholds for cardiovascular cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs) — The 2014 ACC/AHA cost-value methodology statement provided thresholds to identify high-, intermediate-, and low-value care based on U.S. per capita gross domestic product, and the writing committee determined that an intervention with an ICER < $50 000 per QALY gained should be considered high value, $50 000 to < $150 000 (1–3× per capita GDP) per QALY gained should be considered intermediate value, and ≥ $150 000 per QALY gained should be considered low value. WHO-origin GDP benchmarks suggested an intervention that costs less than 3 times the national annual GDP per capita per disability-adjusted life year averted should be considered cost-effective and that costs less than 1 times should be considered highly cost-effective, but critics note they "set such a low bar for cost effectiveness that very few interventions with evidence of efficacy can be ruled out"; WHO experts now also advise against per capita GDP-based thresholds and suggest considering cost-effectiveness alongside other contextual information in a transparent multicomponent decision process. Reflecting these concerns, the writing committee reviewed alternative approaches to incorporating CEA results into guidelines, including relying on US-based studies for identifying a cost-effectiveness threshold or thresholds for cardiovascular CEAs, and Vanness et al used a health opportunity cost approach estimating that for every $1 000 000 increase in health care expenditures, 1869 persons become uninsured, resulting in 81 QALYs lost due to mortality and 15 QALYs lost due to morbidity, implying a cost-effectiveness threshold of $104 000 per QALY ($51 000 to $209 000 per QALY) in 2019 US dollars; in the probabilistic analysis, 40% of the simulations suggested the threshold was less than $100 000 per QALY.

### Estimated research and development investment needed to bring a new medicine to market, 2009–2018 [^462738e4]. JAMA (2020). Excellent credibility.

Importance

The mean cost of developing a new drug has been the subject of debate, with recent estimates ranging from $314 million to $2.8 billion.

Objective

To estimate the research and development investment required to bring a new therapeutic agent to market, using publicly available data.

Design and Setting

Data were analyzed on new therapeutic agents approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) between 2009 and 2018 to estimate the research and development expenditure required to bring a new medicine to market. Data were accessed from the US Securities and Exchange Commission, Drugs@FDA database, and ClinicalTrials.gov, alongside published data on clinical trial success rates.

Exposures

Conduct of preclinical and clinical studies of new therapeutic agents.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Median and mean research and development spending on new therapeutic agents approved by the FDA, capitalized at a real cost of capital rate (the required rate of return for an investor) of 10.5% per year, with bootstrapped CIs. All amounts were reported in 2018 US dollars.

Results

The FDA approved 355 new drugs and biologics over the study period. Research and development expenditures were available for 63 (18%) products, developed by 47 different companies. After accounting for the costs of failed trials, the median capitalized research and development investment to bring a new drug to market was estimated at $985.3 million (95% CI, $683.6 million-$1228.9 million), and the mean investment was estimated at $1335.9 million (95% CI, $1042.5 million-$1637.5 million) in the base case analysis. Median estimates by therapeutic area (for areas with ≥ 5 drugs) ranged from $765.9 million (95% CI, $323.0 million-$1473.5 million) for nervous system agents to $2771.6 million (95% CI, $2051.8 million-$5366.2 million) for antineoplastic and immunomodulating agents. Data were mainly accessible for smaller firms, orphan drugs, products in certain therapeutic areas, first-in-class drugs, therapeutic agents that received accelerated approval, and products approved between 2014 and 2018. Results varied in sensitivity analyses using different estimates of clinical trial success rates, preclinical expenditures, and cost of capital.

Conclusions and Relevance

This study provides an estimate of research and development costs for new therapeutic agents based on publicly available data. Differences from previous studies may reflect the spectrum of products analyzed, the restricted availability of data in the public domain, and differences in underlying assumptions in the cost calculations.

### The imperative to enhance cost-effectiveness for cardiovascular therapeutic development [^59b98795]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2024). Medium credibility.

The declining internal rate of return of drug development, combined with increasing research and development costs, has led the pharmaceutical industry to scrutinize investment portfolios and determine which therapeutic areas to pursue and which potentially promising agents must be terminated. For example, although early phase development of antineoplastic therapeutic agents grew by 6.88% from 1990 to 2007, early phase development of CV agents within this same period decreased by 4.57%. Once an agent reaches the clinical trial phase of drug development, the odds are still strong that it will be discontinued. According to the Congressional Budget Office, only 12% of drugs entering clinical trials are approved by the FDA. Furthermore, the rate of discontinuation appears to be on the rise; a recent analysis found that among the top 20 pharmaceutical companies by spending, the number of terminated therapeutic agents doubled from 15 in 2021 to 30 in 2022. Among potential CV agents, 12 candidates were terminated in the years 2016 to 2018 within the clinical trials phase of development: 3 candidates in phase 1, 6 in phase 2, and 3 in phase 3. Half were discontinued owing to lack of efficacy and the other half owing to strategic or unspecified reasons. Overall, the later the development phase of the agent, the greater the financial burden of its failure. Given the high stakes of drug development, it is not surprising that therapeutic target selection and development are likely driven by financial investment risk at least as much as the potential ability to meet a therapeutic need.

Additional investment considerations before therapeutic target selection include market saturation and the regulatory environment, the latter including both patent regulations as well as approval and commercial regulations. First-to-market pharmaceutical manufacturers are awarded 5 years of regulatory exclusivity for new chemical entities in the U.S. and 10 years in the European Union. Once exclusivity is gone, the market can quickly become saturated and profit margins dwindle. Five years of exclusivity may not provide enough time to recover development costs, particularly for CV drugs. This can result in either failure to initiate a promising therapeutic agent or a significant price increase to offset projected losses attributed to shortened market exclusivity, both of which ultimately affect the patient.

### Incorporating economic evidence in clinical guidelines: a framework from the clinical guidelines committee of the American College of Physicians [^76698a7b]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Identifying resource utilization (intervention cost) data — resource utilization reflects the goods and services needed to deliver an intervention and their associated costs, and the cost of an intervention represents the immediate costs of those goods and services and any future cost savings that might occur because utilization is reduced. The Clinical Guidelines Committee (CGC) reports on costs of medications and may consider other components of resource utilization; it searches national databases, such as the National Health Expenditure Data of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, considers annualized wholesale acquisition costs (WAC) for each eligible pharmacologic treatment, and, if national data are unavailable, searches for published, peer‑reviewed economic analyses. The CGC considers resource utilization data to understand economic burden, range, and trends in national spending over time.

### A model of determining a fair market value for teaching residents: who profits? [^3883e4d7]. Pediatrics (2003). Low credibility.

Context

Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) Health Resources and Services Administration Children's Hospitals Graduate Medical Education (GME) Payment Program now supports freestanding children's teaching hospitals.

Objective

To analyze the fair market value impact of GME payment on resident teaching efforts in our pediatric intensive care unit (PICU).

Design

Cost-accounting model, developed from a 1-year retrospective, descriptive, single-institution, longitudinal study, applied to physician teachers, residents, and CMS.

Setting

Sixteen-bed PICU in a freestanding, university-affiliated children's teaching hospital.

Participants

Pediatric critical care physicians, second-year residents.

Main Outcome Measures

Cost of physician opportunity time; CMS investment return; the teaching physicians' investment return; residents' investment return; service balance between CMS and teaching service investment margins; economic balance points; fair market value.

Results

GME payments to our hospital increased 4.8-fold from 577 886 dollars to 2 772 606 dollars during a 1-year period. Critical care physicians' teaching opportunity cost rose from 250 097 dollars to 262 215 dollars to provide 1523 educational hours (6853 relative value units). Residents' net financial value for service provided to the PICU rose from 245 964 dollars to 317 299 dollars. There is an uneven return on investment in resident education for CMS, critical care physicians, and residents. Economic balance points are achievable for the present educational efforts of the CMS, critical care physicians, and residents if the present direct medical education payment increases from 29.38% to 36%.

Conclusions

The current CMS Health Resources and Services Administration Children's Hospitals GME Payment Program produces uneven investment returns for CMS, critical care physicians, and residents. We propose a cost-accounting model, based on perceived production capability measured in relative value units and available GME funds, that would allow a clinical service to balance and obtain a fair market value for the resident education efforts of CMS, physician teachers, and residents.

### WHO-led consensus statement on vaccine delivery costing: process, methods, and findings [^e021a98a]. BMC Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Recommended costing terminology and principles

After reviewing the definitions of costing terms, the following definitions of costing terms are recommended:
Vaccine delivery costs Costs associated with delivering immunization programs to target populations, exclusive of vaccine costs.
Vaccine cost At a minimum includes the cost of the vaccine and diluent (if applicable); the analysis should include accounting for wastage rates; the analyst should specify whether this also includes injection supplies (syringes), international shipment, insurance, and customs/duties.
Financial cost Monetary outlays, with straight-line depreciation for capital goods; does not include opportunity costs for use of resources or donated goods and services from sources other than the payer(s) defined in the analysis. Definition is dependent on perspective since monetary outlays are specific to the payer(s) defined in the analysis.
Economic cost The value of all resources utilized, regardless of the source of financing. Includes opportunity costs for use of existing resources and any donated goods or services from any source. Capital costs are annualized and discounted.
Undepreciated financial cost Financial costs without depreciation of capital costs (note: such costs have been termed "initial investment" in some costing tools and referred to as fiscal costs in previous analyses.)
Recurrent cost Value of resources that last less than one year. Start-up activity costs may include recurrent costs.
Capital cost Value of resources lasting more than one year such as equipment, buildings, and trainings. Start-up activity costs may include capital costs.
Incremental cost Cost of adding a new service/intervention or a package of services/interventions over and above an existing program; inclusion of existing resources will depend on assumptions made about excess capacity (i.e. whether resources are underemployed; if there are no slack resources (e.g. all personnel time is fully allocated before the addition of the new service/intervention), then their use for the new service or intervention incurs an opportunity cost that should be included — either by measurement or assumption).
Full cost Baseline cost as well as the additional/incremental cost of the new intervention, including vaccine cost.
Cost projection Estimation of future costs of both recurrent and capital inputs.
Prospective data collection Direct observation of resource use during intervention implementation; i.e. data are collected concurrently with intervention implementation.
Retrospective data collection Data collection after resource use is completed.
Start-up cost Cost of initial one-time programmatic activities. Examples may include initial micro-planning, initial training activities, and initial sensitization/social mobilization/information, education, and communication (IEC); does not include routine or repeated programmatic activities such as refresher training or annual microplanning. Start-up activities may include both recurrent and capital costs; they are defined by the non-repeating nature of the activity, not the type of input.
Micro-costing Focuses on granular accounting of input prices and quantities; disaggregates costs of particular output into specific goods and services consumed.
Bottom-up costing Measures input quantities at the client (e.g. per vaccination administered) or activity level.
Top-down costing Divides overall program cost or expenditures, often including those at administrative levels above service delivery level, by number of outputs to calculate unit cost.
Perspective The point of view considered for costs (and benefits, if included) in a costing study, by whom the costs were incurred. Payers are the disbursing agents for a good or service, and may differ from the original source of funding. A provider perspective includes costs incurred by health service providers (can be limited to the government), a payer perspective includes costs to the payer(s), such as government or an external partner, while the societal perspective includes all costs incurred by providers as well as clients.
Shared cost Shared resources that are not used only for immunization, but also for other productive activities.

### Addressing the challenges of implementing evidence-based prioritisation in global health [^8831d055]. BMJ Global Health (2023). High credibility.

Evidence-based decision-making

Following technical assessments, such as JEE, PVS and NAPHS, scientific evidence for effective action is limited. Routine communicable diseases, emerging and re-emerging outbreaks, or the most immediately achievable option may be chosen to fill short-term needs due to urgency, pressure and limited resources. Evidence from research outside the assessment tools, however, must also be considered, for instance operational and implementation research can help decision-making to maximise strategic value of services and systems.

Lack of diversity can influence the gaps addressed and where resources are allocated. This may neither support strategic capacity building nor leverage analytical expertise or data. Priorities and indicators working towards sustainability are likely to be different than for short-term improvements. Key stakeholders need to know the financial, intellectual and time investments they are making will be cost-effective, sustainable, likely to succeed and facilitate future capacity building.

Evidence-based decision-making allows more systematic allocation of resources and logical stepwise investments for outcomes that can take time to establish (like workforce or domestic sustainable financing). It can also allow tracking of the impact and cost of activities on response and preparedness. Political, social and financial realities still may determine priorities, but at the very least decision-makers can know the potential 'rate of return' for implementations that may increase or decrease their effectiveness, including the savings of prevention.

Building an evidence base for decision-making is not a crisis activity, but a continuous process, ideally bringing new ideas and solutions as issues are identified and building trust among the information 'producers' and 'users'. The strengths of analyses rely on adequate data, modernisation and digitalisation efforts, and critical thinking about how these data and their uncertainties are synthesised into new knowledge. Iterative modelling approaches used for similarly complex systems in other fields exist. Optimal analyses identify key functionalities and goals and then include quality data from diverse sources, yet are transparent, inclusive and fast enough to be practical. Multiple scales are likely to require modelling to ensure diverse needs do not negatively impact each other. In addition, experts involved in building an evidence base should be present during discussions, to communicate the strengths and limitations of available data and analyses. This represents substantial but necessary commitments to pursuing solid evidence-based approaches for improving prioritisation.

### Incorporating economic evidence in clinical guidelines: a framework from the clinical guidelines committee of the American College of Physicians [^2824d31a]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

American College of Physicians (ACP) Clinical Guidelines Committee (CGC) economic evidence framework standardizes how economic information is incorporated into guideline recommendations: economic evidence is one component of ACP recommendations, and the CGC first and foremost assesses the certainty of evidence for clinical net benefit of interventions; it then considers patient values and preferences, and only then considers economic evidence to develop recommendations. The CGC considers 3 types of economic evidence: 1) cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs), 2) economic outcomes in randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and 3) resource utilization (intervention cost) data. A CEA is an economic evaluation that compares the relative health benefits, harms, and costs among different interventions for the same disease or condition and provides a ratio of incremental (additional) cost needed to achieve incremental (additional) clinical net benefit, such as the cost to increase longevity and gain a quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). The CGC defines a high-value intervention as one whose clinical net benefit justifies its cost. As context, health care spending in the United States increased by 30%, from $2.7 trillion to $3.5 trillion between 2009 and 2019.

### Determining value of coordinated registry networks (CRNs): a case of transcatheter valve therapies [^8ac6d36b]. BMJ Surgery, Interventions, & Health Technologies (2019). High credibility.

Background

The Transcatheter Valve Therapy (TVT) Coordinated Registry Network (CRN) supported 23 regulatory decisions and ensured evidence-based evaluation of the application of TVT technology. However, there are cost concerns that require value assessment of the TVT CRN compared with traditional study designs.

Objectives

We aimed to determine the value created by the TVT CRN based on (1) Return on investment (ROI), (2) Time saved (TS) in conducting necessary regulatory studies.

Methods

For both ROI and TS analyses, we compared studies that used the TVT CRN with those that would have been required if the registry did not exist (counterfactual studies). To estimate ROI, we accounted for the costs of investment and gain from investment. Both the counterfactual costs and length of studies were projected using design specifications determined by US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewers.

Results

We identified 21 studies using the TVT CRN (supporting 23 FDA decisions) that generated evidence on TVT for three device manufacturers. ROI is estimated to be greater than 550%. TS by using the CRN ranged from months to years.

Conclusions

The CRN method to evidence generation creates value for manufacturers and the broader device ecosystem, demonstrated with this example of the TVT CRN. The public health benefits of evidence created by this CRN outweighs the difference in data quality between traditional clinical studies and the CRN method.

### Population genomic screening of all young adults in a health-care system: a cost-effectiveness analysis [^bb25c247]. Genetics in Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Secondly, we combined models to investigate the cost-effectiveness of screening for multiple groups of conditions concurrently, including combined testing for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer, combined testing for Lynch syndrome, and combined carrier screening (CF + SMA + FXS) (Fig. 3b). We found all three of these combined scenarios to be cost-effective, demonstrating the efficiency of combined screening. We found population testing for all four cancers combined would be highly cost-effective, independently of carrier screening (ICER AUD$10,656 [$7470 to $15,237]/DALY prevented) (Fig. 3c).

Finally, we considered the total health impact and cost-effectiveness of combining all seven models, maintaining a combined test cost of AUD$400 (Fig. 3d). This scenario, using conservative intervention estimates, was found to be highly cost-effective (ICER = AUD$4038 [$4 to $7740]/DALY). Screening for all seven conditions at AUD$400 would require an additional health system investment of AUD$622 million ($433 to $819 million), above the current cost of targeted testing in Australia. This would include costs of initial screening, plus subsequent confirmatory testing and genetic counseling, for all identified PV carriers and at-risk couples in the target population. Screening would prevent an estimated 73,728 (53,303 to 104,266) DALYs and save AUD$311 million ($168 to $517 million) in treatment costs through prevention, for a net health system cost of AUD$302 million ($0 to $573 million), above current expenditure (Table 1).

### 2025 AHA / ACC statement on cost / value methodology in clinical practice guidelines (update from 2014 statement): a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^0390b45b]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs) — importance and projected cardiovascular disease costs are outlined: Over the next 30 years, health care costs attributable to cardiovascular disease in the United States are expected to quadruple, even after accounting for inflation — from $338 billion in 2020 to $1.4 trillion in 2050, an increase from 2.7% of the gross domestic product (GDP) in 2020 to 4.6% of the projected GDP in 2050. CEAs can help promote efficient allocation of finite societal resources by weighing the effectiveness of an intervention against the incremental use of resources, and it is important to note that CEAs are not simply about minimizing costs: they systematically evaluate the incremental cost-effectiveness of an intervention relative to the best alternative to maximize the population health benefits, given finite available resources.

### Cataract surgery cost utility revisited in 2012: a new economic paradigm [^0ebaf3f3]. Ophthalmology (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the 2012 cost utility of cataract surgery in the United States and to compare 2012 cost-utility data with those from 2000.

Design

Value-Based Medicine (Flourtown, PA), patient preference-based, comparative effectiveness analysis and cost-utility analysis using 2012 real United States dollars.

Participants

Previously published Patient Outcomes Research Team Study data and time tradeoff utilities obtained from patients with vision loss. Visual acuity measurements from patients wtih untreated cataract were used as controls.

Intervention

Thirteen-year, average, first-eye and second-eye cataract surgery cost-utility analysis using the societal and third-party insurer cost perspectives.

Main Outcome Measures

Patient value gain in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and percent gain in quality of life as well as the cost-utility ratio using the dollars expended per QALY gained. Patient and financial value outcomes were discounted at 3% annually with net present value analysis.

Results

First-eye cataract surgery conferred 1.6212 QALYs over the 13-year model, a 20.8% quality-of-life gain. Bilateral cataract surgery conferred 2.8152 QALYs over 13 years, a 36.2% improvement in quality of life. The direct ophthalmic medical cost for unilateral cataract surgery in 2012 United States nominal dollars was $2653, an inflation-adjusted 34.2% less than in 2000 and 85% less than in 1985. The 2012 inflation-adjusted physician fee was 10.1% of that in 1985. The 13-year societal cost perspective, financial return on investment (ROI) for first-eye cataract surgery was $121,198, a 4567% gain. The third-party insurer cost perspective average cost-utility ratio was $2653/1.6212 = $1636/QALY for unilateral cataract surgery, whereas the societal cost perspective average cost-utility ratio was -$121,198/1.6212 = -$74,759/QALY. The net 13-year $123.4-billion financial ROI from a 1-year cohort of cataract surgery patients was accrued: Medicare, $36.4 billion; Medicaid, $3.3 billion; other insurers, $9.6 billion; patients, $48.6 billion; and increased United States national productivity, $25.4 billion.

Conclusions

Cataract surgery in 2012 greatly improved quality of life and was highly cost effective. It was 34.4% less expensive than in 2000 and 85% less expensive than in 1985. Initial cataract surgery yielded an extraordinary 4567% financial ROI to society over the 13-year model.

### Financial incentives for transcatheter aortic valve implantation in Ontario, Canada: a cost-utility analysis [^3ad99512]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study applies a novel application of cost‐effectiveness analysis to determine the maximum investment in TAVI that can be justifiably made by the Ontario Ministry of Health: up to $13 993 (± $8808) per person can be invested to meet quality indicator targets, assuming a cost‐effectiveness threshold of $50 000 per QALY. Our results demonstrate that incentives of up to ≈$22 million for TAVI quality improvement in Ontario may be economically justifiable. The 2021 Ontario provincial budget has committed $300 million toward reduced procedural wait times and ≈$780 million toward investment in services for which demand is increasing, including cardiac services specifically. Our estimates for TAVI quality‐improvement funding would represent a fraction of these committed funds and should therefore be a feasible spending target.

Our results, and the methods to produce them, are of relevance to Canada as well as health care systems internationally. Rapidly increasing demand for TAVI is a worldwide phenomenon with major impact on health care resource planning. Further increases in annual referrals up to 177 000 and 90 000 in Europe and North America, respectively, well above current rates, may be expected if results from ongoing trials, such as the EARLY TAVR (Evaluation of TAVR Compared to Surveillance for Patients With Asymptomatic Severe Aortic Stenosis) trial, favor TAVI in low‐risk and asymptomatic patients (EARLY TAVR, clinicaltrials.gov: NCT03042104). However, economic constraints have restricted capacity building, and TAVI programs currently able to offer a high standard of care may become overwhelmed as referrals increase. Financial investment in TAVI might be a solution in health care systems already experiencing this strain or help minimize deterioration in the standard of care in other programs. However, because financial incentives toward TAVI would add costs to the health care system, the ideal investment would not exceed the value of the health gains produced. Cost‐effectiveness analysis uses a formal method to combine economic and clinical outcomes into a single measure of value. Pandya et al (2020) recently developed a quantitative approach to determine the upper bound for financial incentives using cost‐effectiveness analysis, and we have adapted their approach for TAVI. Our article demonstrates how health economic modeling may reveal the magnitude of resources from the perspective of the health care payer that can be dedicated toward incentivizing program change.

### Rates of maternal weight gain over the course of pregnancy and offspring risk of neurodevelopmental disorders [^59a09285]. BMC Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

The rate of weight gain (kg/week) during the second trimester (RGWG-T2) was calculated using the difference in the last weight measurement in the second trimester and the last weight measurement taken in the first trimester divided by the gestational week interval between the measurements. As the weight gain in the first trimester was usually small (i.e. ~ 1–2 kg) compared to the second and third trimesters and most women only had one measurement in the first trimester, we recoded the timing of measurement in the first trimester as 13 wkGA if the measurement was taken before 13 wkGA to avoid underestimating RGWG in the second trimester. The rate of weight gain (kg/week) during the third trimester (RGWG-T3) was similarly calculated, using the difference in the final weight measurement before delivery and the last weight measurement taken in the second trimester divided by the gestational week interval between the measurements.
