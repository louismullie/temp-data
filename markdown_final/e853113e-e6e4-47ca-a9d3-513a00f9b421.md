## Question

Birth mark enlargement

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to evaluate and manage an enlarging birthmark. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about classifying the birthmark and confirming whether the enlargement is expected growth versus true progression. Then, I should verify red flags that mandate urgent action, including ulceration, functional compromise, or syndromic associations. Next, I will consider age-specific pathways for infantile hemangioma, port-wine stain, and congenital melanocytic nevus, followed by when to biopsy or image. Finally, I will outline treatment options, follow-up cadence, and counseling points, ensuring I double-check guideline-based timing and risk stratification throughout.

> Let me first confirm the birthmark category and baseline features, because management hinges on whether this is vascular, melanocytic, epidermal, or a marker of neural tube defects. I need to check morphology, distribution, and whether it was present at birth or appeared shortly thereafter, since many vascular birthmarks evolve over early infancy and melanocytic nevi grow proportionally with the child [^116AHmVu] [^112uid57]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — some lesions that look "enlarging" are actually following expected physiologic growth trajectories, so I should anchor on the expected natural history for the specific lesion type before labeling it pathologic enlargement [^114nUsvV].

> Next, I should review the growth pattern and timing to distinguish expected proportional growth from true progression. For example, infantile hemangiomas typically proliferate rapidly between 1 and 3 months of life, whereas port-wine stains darken and may thicken over years, and congenital melanocytic nevi enlarge in concert with the child's growth, so a sudden acceleration outside those windows is what worries me [^111qVXix] [^114H6mR9] [^112uid57]. Wait, let me verify the hemangioma timeline — most superficial IHs accelerate between 5 and 7 weeks, which is why early referral by 4 weeks is emphasized for high-risk features, so if the infant is beyond that window and the lesion is still accelerating, I should escalate evaluation [^115Ay8aY].

> I will now examine for red flags that require urgent action: ulceration, bleeding, pain, rapid asymmetric growth, functional compromise (e.g., periocular, perioral, airway, anogenital), and signs of syndromic disease such as seizures, limb asymmetry, or neurologic symptoms. These findings push me toward expedited treatment or imaging rather than observation [^114fTgDc] [^111qVXix]. Hold on, I should verify the syndromic links — facial port-wine stains can signal Sturge-Weber, large lateral lower-extremity vascular stains can be associated with overgrowth and underlying vascular malformations, and multiple congenital melanocytic nevi raise concern for CMN syndrome with CNS involvement, so I need to screen accordingly [^111wydRx] [^111sz5fk].

> For infantile hemangioma, I need to ensure I am applying risk stratification correctly. High-risk sites (face, periocular, perioral, airway, anogenital), large size, segmental morphology, ulceration, or functional risk warrant early systemic therapy, and the window of opportunity is in early infancy when beta-blockers are most effective and safest, so I should not delay if those features are present [^116qaNWw] [^115Ay8aY]. Wait, let me double-check the timing — referral by 4 weeks is recommended when high-risk features are suspected, and photographic triage can expedite care if access is limited, which matters because growth can be explosive in the first months [^115Ay8aY].

> For port-wine stains, I should confirm whether the "enlargement" reflects expected growth with the child versus progressive nodularity and hypertrophy. Early pulsed dye laser therapy improves cosmetic outcomes and may mitigate later fibrosis and disfigurement, and facial lesions deserve consideration of ophthalmologic and neurologic screening for Sturge-Weber when V1/V2 distributions are involved or when the lesion is large [^114vrXtr] [^114H6mR9]. But wait, what if the lesion is darkening and thickening — that pattern suggests progression that benefits from earlier laser intervention, and larger facial port-wine birthmark size correlates with greater neurologic severity in SWS, so I should maintain a low threshold for neuro-ophthalmologic evaluation in those cases [^114vrXtr] [^116a4Vk3].

> For congenital melanocytic nevi, I need to check size, number, and evolution. Small solitary CMN under 20 cm projected adult size can usually be observed, whereas larger or multiple CMN warrant dermatology referral and consideration of neurologic screening, and any nodularity, rapid growth, color change, bleeding, or symptoms should prompt biopsy to exclude melanoma or proliferative nodules [^116AHmVu] [^111sz5fk]. Hold on, I should verify the risk framing — multiple CMN carry increased melanoma risk, including CNS primaries, and expert histopathology plus molecular testing can help distinguish malignant transformation from benign proliferative nodules, so I must not under-triage evolving lesions in this group [^111sz5fk].

> I need to ensure I do not miss epidermal nevi and other nonvascular, nonmelanocytic birthmarks. Linear epidermal nevi can expand with growth and, rarely, harbor malignant potential or be associated with syndromes, so new nodularity, ulceration, or rapid change should prompt biopsy and specialist input, even though most are managed conservatively [^notfound]. Let me reconsider the differential — if the lesion is verrucous or scaly and linear, that strengthens the case for epidermal nevus and supports referral for evaluation of any atypical changes [^notfound].

> Next, I should review when to image and when to biopsy. For vascular lesions with limb asymmetry or overgrowth, I should obtain MRI/MR venography to assess for underlying vascular malformations, and for suspected CMN syndrome I should consider brain MRI in infancy to evaluate for neurocutaneous melanosis or CNS melanoma risk, guided by lesion burden and neurologic symptoms [^111sz5fk]. For melanocytic lesions, I should confirm that any rapid change, asymmetry, or nodularity prompts excisional or incisional biopsy by a dermatologist, with attention to histopathology and, when indicated, molecular studies to distinguish malignant transformation from benign proliferative nodules [^111sz5fk]. Hmm, wait a minute — do I need imaging for a simple port-wine stain without neurologic or ocular signs? Generally no, but I should screen appropriately if the distribution or size raises SWS concern, and proceed to MRI if seizures, hemiparesis, or glaucoma risk factors emerge [^notfound].

> Treatment selection should follow etiology and risk. For high-risk infantile hemangiomas, oral propranolol is first-line and is superior to historical corticosteroids, with topical beta-blockers for small superficial lesions, and I should monitor for hypoglycemia, bradycardia, and respiratory symptoms during therapy [^114fTgDc]. For port-wine stains, pulsed dye laser is standard and earlier treatment yields better clearance; I should coordinate anesthesia decisions case-by-case in infants and set expectations for multiple sessions [^114vrXtr] [^114H6mR9]. For CMN, management is individualized — observation for small lesions versus staged excision, lasers for difficult sites, and heightened surveillance for multiple CMN; I should counsel families on sun protection and consider vitamin D optimization in children with extensive nevi, balancing melanoma risk with practical guidance [^116AHmVu] [^112LgtrK]. Hold on, I should verify that I am not overstating malignancy risk in small CMN — the absolute risk is low, but the relative risk rises with size and multiplicity, which justifies tailored follow-up plans [^111sz5fk].

> Follow-up cadence should match risk. For infantile hemangiomas, early frequent visits in the first 3 to 6 months are critical, then spacing out as the lesion stabilizes and involutes, with continued surveillance for residual fibrofatty changes or scarring that may benefit from surgical consultation [^111qVXix]. For port-wine stains, I should reassess every few months in infancy during laser therapy and then annually to monitor for recurrence or nodularity, adjusting expectations as color and vessel depth evolve with age [^notfound]. For CMN, annual skin exams are reasonable for small solitary lesions, whereas multiple CMN warrant semiannual visits and prompt evaluation of any new or changing nodules, ideally within weeks of detection [^notfound]. I should double-check that families know warning signs — bleeding, crusting, rapid growth, color variegation, or symptoms — which should trigger urgent review [^116m5BxQ].

> Counseling and education are essential. I need to explain expected growth patterns, warning signs of complications, and the rationale for early intervention in high-risk vascular lesions, while also addressing psychosocial impacts and connecting families with support resources when disfigurement or syndromic disease is a concern [^114fTgDc] [^114vrXtr]. Let me verify that I am providing balanced risk information — most birthmarks are benign, but some carry meaningful risks that justify proactive therapy or surveillance, and clear, written care plans improve adherence and reduce anxiety [^116AHmVu].

> In summary, I should confirm the birthmark type, distinguish expected growth from pathologic progression, screen for red flags and syndromic associations, apply lesion-specific guidelines for timing of therapy, and use imaging or biopsy judiciously. If I find myself assuming "wait and see", I should pause and verify whether the child's age and lesion features still allow for the optimal window of intervention, especially in infantile hemangioma and port-wine stain, where earlier treatment changes outcomes [^114fTgDc] [^114vrXtr]. Hold on, I should verify one last point — rapid enlargement in any birthmark outside the expected growth phase deserves expedited dermatology input, and photographic documentation at each visit helps track change objectively and guide decisions over time [^115Ay8aY].

Birthmark enlargement is most often due to **normal growth with the child** [^112uid57] or **physiologic changes** such as color darkening or thickening [^114nUsvV] [^114ygCvS]. However, enlargement can also signal **pathology**: infantile hemangiomas proliferate rapidly in early infancy [^111qVXix] [^115Ay8aY], port-wine stains darken and thicken over time [^114H6mR9] [^114ygCvS], and congenital melanocytic nevi may enlarge with rare malignant transformation [^111sz5fk] [^112uid57]. Rapid enlargement, color change, bleeding, or new symptoms warrant **urgent evaluation** [^116m5BxQ] to exclude malignancy or complications [^111qVXix]. Management is tailored: observe benign lesions, treat hemangiomas with beta-blockers if indicated [^114fTgDc], and use laser or surgery for persistent or complicated vascular or melanocytic lesions [^114vrXtr] [^111JRGET].

---

## Physiological reasons for birthmark enlargement

Physiological enlargement reflects **normal growth or benign developmental changes** and typically does not indicate disease:

- **Normal growth**: Most birthmarks enlarge proportionally with the child, reflecting normal development [^112uid57] [^116z875j].

- **Color darkening**: Vascular birthmarks, such as port-wine stains, may darken with age due to vascular remodeling and increased blood flow [^114H6mR9] [^114ygCvS].

- **Thickening**: Port-wine stains can thicken and become nodular over time, reflecting chronic vascular changes [^114H6mR9] [^114vrXtr].

---

## Pathological reasons for birthmark enlargement

Pathological enlargement reflects **underlying disease** and may require intervention:

- **Infantile hemangiomas**: Rapid proliferation in early infancy, often peaking at 1–3 months, then involuting over years [^111qVXix] [^115Ay8aY].

- **Port-wine stains**: Progressive enlargement, darkening, and nodularity; may indicate underlying vascular malformations or syndromes (e.g. Sturge-Weber) [^114vrXtr] [^116a4Vk3].

- **Congenital melanocytic nevi**: Enlargement with rare malignant transformation; rapid change or new nodules warrant evaluation [^111sz5fk] [^114mjJJV].

- **Vascular malformations**: Capillary malformations may enlarge and cause limb overgrowth or other complications [^111wydRx] [^114nV3KP].

---

## Clinical evaluation of enlarging birthmarks

A thorough clinical evaluation should include:

- **History**: Age at onset, rate of enlargement, associated symptoms (pain, bleeding, ulceration), family history, and recent trauma or infection [^116m5BxQ].

- **Physical examination**: Size, color, texture, location, and presence of nodules or ulceration [^111qVXix].

- **Imaging**: Ultrasound, MRI, or CT may be needed to assess depth, vascular involvement, or underlying structures [^115WvevK].

- **Biopsy**: Indicated for suspected malignancy or atypical features [^111YEVrx].

---

## Potential complications of birthmark enlargement

Enlargement can lead to **functional and cosmetic complications**:

- **Functional impairment**: Vision, feeding, or airway obstruction, especially with periocular or oral lesions [^notfound].

- **Cosmetic disfigurement**: Significant psychosocial impact, particularly with facial lesions [^114fTgDc].

- **Ulceration and bleeding**: Common in rapidly enlarging hemangiomas or vascular malformations [^notfound].

- **Malignant transformation**: Rare in congenital melanocytic nevi or other pigmented lesions [^113H2Q3P].

---

## Treatment options for enlarging birthmarks

Treatment depends on the **type, size, location, and rate of enlargement**:

| **Birthmark type** | **Treatment options** |
|-|-|
| Infantile hemangioma | - Observation <br/> - Beta-blockers (propranolol) <br/> - Corticosteroids <br/> - Laser therapy <br/> - Surgical excision [^114fTgDc] [^116qaNWw] |
| Port-wine stain | - Laser therapy (pulsed dye laser) <br/> - Surgical excision <br/> - Observation [^114vrXtr] [^114H6mR9] |
| Congenital melanocytic nevus | - Observation <br/> - Surgical excision <br/> - Laser therapy [^115WvevK] [^111sz5fk] |
| Vascular malformation | - Laser therapy <br/> - Sclerotherapy <br/> - Surgical excision <br/> - Embolization [^115PVLkj] |

---

## Prognosis and long-term outcomes

Prognosis varies by **type and treatment**. Infantile hemangiomas often involute spontaneously, though complications may persist [^111qVXix]; port-wine stains respond well to laser therapy, though multiple sessions are often needed [^116AHmVu]; and congenital melanocytic nevi carry a low but real malignancy risk, necessitating long-term follow-up [^111sz5fk].

---

Birthmark enlargement spans benign growth and pathologic change; **careful evaluation and targeted therapy** optimize outcomes, and **urgent assessment is warranted** for rapid enlargement, color change, bleeding, or new symptoms [^115Ay8aY].

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of infantile hemangiomas [^116qaNWw]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Infantile hemangioma (IH) risk stratification and timing — management planning must be tied to risk factors because growth is hard to predict: Even for the most experienced clinicians, it can be difficult to predict the degree of IH growth until several weeks to months after the lesion is first noticed. Hence, decisions regarding intervention must be based on risk stratification, including the age of the child (in anticipation of possible IH growth), health considerations (like prematurity), anatomic site, the size of the IH, any actual or potential complications, and parental preferences. In high-risk IHs, a wait-and-see approach can result in a missed window of opportunity to prevent adverse outcomes.

### CKD in aboriginal Australians [^115YmNSw]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is one component of a spectrum of chronic disease in Aboriginal Australians. CKD is marked by albuminuria, which predicts renal failure and nonrenal natural death. Rates vary greatly by community and region and are much higher in remote areas. This reflects the heterogeneous characteristics and circumstances of Aboriginal people. CKD is multideterminant, and early-life influences (notably low birth weight), infections (including poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis), metabolic/hemodynamic parameters, and epigenetic/genetic factors probably contribute. CKD is associated intimately with cardiovascular risk. Albuminuria progresses over time, with a high incidence of new onset of pathologic levels of albuminuria in all age groups. All the usual morphologic findings are found in renal biopsy specimens. However, glomerular enlargement is notable in individuals from remote regions, but not those living closer to population centers. Glomerulomegaly probably represents compensatory hypertrophy caused by low nephron number, which probably underlies the accentuated susceptibility to renal disease. In the last decade, health care services have been transformed to accommodate systematic chronic disease surveillance and management. After a relentless increase for 3 decades, rates of Aboriginal people starting renal replacement therapy, as well as chronic disease deaths, appear to be stabilizing in some regions. Official endorsement of these system changes, plus ongoing reductions in the incidence of low birth weight and infections, hold promise for continued better outcomes.

### Large birth mark and unilateral swelling of the lower extremity in a young teenager [^111wydRx]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

We describe an early adolescent male who was diagnosed with vascular malformation associated with unilateral limb overgrowth based on the clinical findings of a persistent port-wine stain since birth and gradually progressing right lower limb oedema since early childhood. Clinicians should keep in mind to clinically evaluate such malformations in detail, as well as contemplate genetic testing in patients presenting with a large port-wine stain at birth, particularly if well demarcated and lateral in a lower extremity.

### Newborn skin: part II. birthmarks [^116AHmVu]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Birthmarks in newborns can be classified as vascular, melanocytic or pigmented, or markers of underlying developmental abnormalities of the nervous system. A nevus simplex is a benign capillary malformation. Newborns with a nevus flammeus can be safely treated before one year of age with a pulsed dye laser to reduce the visibility of lesions. Infantile hemangiomas should be treated with systemic beta blockers if there is a risk of life-threatening complications, functional impairment, ulceration, underlying abnormalities, permanent scarring, or alteration of anatomic landmarks. Dermal melanocytosis is a benign finding that is easily recognized and does not warrant further evaluation. A solitary congenital melanocytic nevus that is less than 20 cm in diameter may be observed in primary care; children with larger or multiple nevi should be referred to pediatric dermatology due to the risk of melanoma. Newborns with skin markers of occult spinal dysraphism (other than a simple, solitary dimple) should have lumbar spine imaging using ultrasonography or magnetic resonance imaging.

. Whites and Asians are most often affected. Solar lentigines result from a local mild proliferation of basal melanocytes from acute and chronic ultraviolet exposure, and subsequent increase in melanization. They differ from ephelides, which result from increased melanin production. The differential diagnosis includes ephelides, café au lait macules, pigmented actinic keratoses, and lentigo maligna. Biopsy should be performed if there is rapid growth or change in a lesion, symptomatic lesions, atypical lesions, or lesions with features suspicious for melanoma. 1 Cryotherapy is associated with pain and a risk of hyperpigmentation. Brief cryotherapy with repeated treatments is preferred over more intense one-time treatment. Multiple light and laser modalities are also effective, but they are more likely to cause postinflammatory hyperpigmentation and usually require dermatologic referral.

1 Figures 5a and 5b show solar lentigines before and after laser treatment. Onset is usually in childhood after sun exposure. These lesions should be differentiated from juvenile lentigines, which appear in early childhood, and solar lentigines, which usually appear later in life. Ephelides are asymptomatic, and treatment is not necessary. Undesired lesions can be treated similarly to lentigines using cryotherapy, hydroquinone, azelaic acid, glycolic acid peels, and laser and other light-based therapies. 1, 12. CAFÉ AU LAIT MACULES Café au lait macules are tan to brown macules ranging from 1 to 20 cm and are present at birth or early in life. More than six lesions should raise suspicion for tuberous sclerosis, neurofibromatosis, Albright syndrome, or Fanconi anemia. Cosmetic treatments include laser therapy or surgical excision.

1.

There are two common types of vitiligo: segmental and nonsegmental. Segmental vitiligo presents as a unilateral or band-shaped distribution of hypopigmented macules, usually 5 to 50 mm in size and coalescent, with rapid stabilization and early age of onset.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Advise women and men to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Patient Information and Instructions for Use)

Hypersensitivity Reactions and Anaphylaxis

Advise women and men to discontinue GONAL-f and seek immediate medical attention if any signs or symptoms of a hypersensitivity reaction occur [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome

Inform women regarding the risks of OHSS [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2] and OHSS-associated conditions including pulmonary and vascular complications [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] and ovarian torsion [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] with the use of GONAL-f. Advise women to seek medical attention if any of these conditions occur.

Abnormal Ovarian Enlargement

Inform women regarding the hazards associated with abnormal ovarian enlargement that may occur with GONAL-f therapy. If the ovaries are abnormally enlarged on the last day of GONAL-f therapy, inform women not to administer hCG and to avoid intercourse [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].

Multi-fetal Gestation and Birth

Advise the woman and her partner of the potential risk of multi-fetal gestation and birth before beginning therapy with GONAL-f [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].

Embryofetal Toxicity

Inform women that the incidence of congenital malformations (birth defects) after some Assisted Reproductive Technology [(ART) specifically in vitro fertilization (IVF) or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI)] may be slightly higher than after spontaneous conception [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].

Ectopic Pregnancy

Inform women undergoing ART that the incidence of ectopic pregnancy may be increased with these procedures, particularly for women with tubal abnormalities. Advise women who become pregnant and have: abdominal/pelvic pain (particularly on one side); shoulder, neck or rectal pain; and nausea and vomiting to seek immediate medical attention [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)].

Spontaneous Abortion

Inform women that the risk of spontaneous abortion (miscarriage) is increased with gonadotropin products (including GONAL-f). However, causality has not been established. The increased risk may be a factor of the underlying infertility [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)].

### Unilateral leg swelling in a newborn [^114nV3KP]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2022). Medium credibility.

A female neonate was born with asymmetric lower limbs, the right leg appearing enlarged, with thickened, reddish-purple skin and ectasic superficial reticulum (figure 1A, B). Limb pulses were present and symmetrical. The girl's family history and prenatal scans were unremarkable. Laboratory findings were within the normal range, except for a mild thrombocytopenia (90 000/μL), which spontaneously resolved during the next few days. A leg X-ray and the Doppler analysis ruled out the presence of calcifications and venous varices, respectively. Ultrasound showed significant skin thickening, with marked dermal hypertrophy and hyperechogenicity. Magnetic resonance showed circumferential thickening of the derma, with mild hypertrophy of some perforating vessels (figure 2). A biopsy of the right thigh showed capillary malformations on histology.

### Abusive head trauma in infants and children: technical report [^1177iuL5]. Pediatrics (2025). High credibility.

Enlarged subarachnoid spaces in infants and young children — key points are that enlargement of the subarachnoid spaces is common in infants and young children, that infrequently enlarged subarachnoid spaces may predispose to the development of small, asymptomatic subdural collections with little or no head trauma, and that each case of unexpected subdural collection or hemorrhage needs thoughtful consideration as to potential of abuse and not simply dismissed as being attributable to the enlarged subarachnoid spaces.

### What are congenital melanocytic nevi? [^116z875j]. Pediatric Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Congenital melanocytic nevi (CMN) are special types of moles. CMN happen when extra pigment-making cells (melanocytes) grow in a baby's skin while the baby is forming before birth. They are not caused by anything their parent did or didn't do during pregnancy. These moles are there when the baby is born, stay on the skin for life, and grow as the child grows.

### Menotropins (menopur) [^114vqMFA]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

What are possible side effects of MENOPUR?

MENOPUR may cause serious side effects, including:

ovaries that are too large. MENOPUR may cause your ovaries to be abnormally large. Symptoms of large ovaries include bloating or pain in your lower stomach (pelvic) area. If your ovaries become too large your healthcare provider may tell you that you should not have intercourse (sex) so you do not rupture an ovarian cyst.
ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). Using MENOPUR may cause OHSS. OHSS is a serious medical condition that can happen when your ovaries produce too many eggs (overstimulated). OHSS can cause fluid to suddenly build up in the area of your stomach, chest, heart, and cause blood clots to form. OHSS may also happen after you stop using MENOPUR. Stop using MENOPUR and call your healthcare provider or go to the nearest hospital emergency room right away if you have any of the following symptoms of OHSS:
severe pelvic or stomach pain
nausea
vomiting
sudden weight gain
swollen stomach
diarrhea
trouble breathing
decreased or no urine
lung problems. MENOPUR may cause serious lung problems that can sometimes lead to death including fluid in the lungs, trouble breathing, and worsening of asthma.
blood clots. MENOPUR may increase your chance of having blood clots in your blood vessels. Blood clots can cause:
blood vessel problems (thrombophlebitis)
stroke
loss of your arm or leg
blood clot in your lung (pulmonary embolus)
twisting (torsion) of your ovary. MENOPUR may increase the chance of your ovary twisting, if you already have certain conditions such as OHSS, pregnancy, and previous abdominal surgery. Twisting of your ovary may lead to blood flow being cut off to your ovary.
pregnancy with and birth of multiple babies. MENOPUR may increase your chance of having a pregnancy with more than 1 baby. Having a pregnancy and giving birth to more than 1 baby at a time increases the health risk for you and your babies. Your healthcare provider should talk to you about your chances of multiple births before you start using MENOPUR.
birth defects. Babies born after ART may have an increased chance of birth defects. Your age, certain sperm problems, your genetic background, and that of your partner, and a pregnancy with more than 1 baby at a time may increase the chance that your baby may have birth defects.
ectopic pregnancy (pregnancy outside your womb). MENOPUR may increase your chance of having a pregnancy that is abnormally outside of your womb. Your chance of having a pregnancy outside of your womb is increased if you also have fallopian tube problems.
miscarriage. Your chance of loss of an early pregnancy may be increased if you had difficulty becoming pregnant.
tumors of the ovary. If you have used medicines like MENOPUR more than 1 time to get pregnant, you may have an increased chance of having tumors in your ovaries, including cancer.

### Congenital melanocytic nevi [^117WskeZ]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

The relative risk for melanoma arising within a congenital nevus is related to the size of the lesion. The timing of and clinical presentation of development of melanoma is also related to the size of the lesion. Medical decisions are individualized taking into account the perceived risk of malignancy, psychosocial impact, and anticipated treatment outcome. In this article, the common features of congenital nevi are discussed as well as the potential individual variations and their impact on treatment recommendations.

### Calcipotriene (Sorilux) [^112Tq8Hn]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

8.1	Pregnancy

Risk Summary

Although there are no available data on the drug- associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes in pregnant women exposed to SORILUX Foam, systemic exposure to calcipotriene is likely to be low [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2, 12.3)].

In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of calcipotriene to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted in an increased incidence of minor skeletal abnormalities, including enlarged fontanelles and extra ribs in rats and an increased incidence of minor skeletal abnormalities, including incomplete ossification of pubic bones and forelimb phalanges in rabbits (see Data). The available data do not allow the calculation of relevant comparisons between the systemic exposure of calcipotriene observed in animal studies to the systemic exposure that would be expected in humans after topical use of SORILUX Foam.

The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively.

Data

Animal Data

Embryofetal development studies were conducted with calcipotriene after oral administration in rats and rabbits. Pregnant rats received daily oral administration of calcipotriene during the period of organogenesis. Fetuses from dams dosed with 54 mcg/kg/day (318 mcg/m2/day) exhibited a significantly increased incidence of minor skeletal abnormalities consisting primarily of enlarged fontanelles and extra ribs. The enlarged fontanelles are most likely due to calcipotriene's effect upon calcium metabolism. There were no effects on the incidence of major malformations in fetuses.

Pregnant rabbits received daily oral administration of calcipotriene during the period of organogenesis. Increased rabbit maternal and fetal toxicity was noted at 12 mcg/kg/day (132 mcg/m2/day). Fetuses from does dosed with 36 mcg/kg/day (396 mcg/m2/day) exhibited a significantly increased incidence of minor skeletal abnormalities including incomplete ossification of pubic bones and forelimb phalanges. There were no effects on the incidence of major malformations in fetuses.

### KDOQI clinical practice guideline for vascular access: 2019 update [^116y34yA]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2020). High credibility.

Arteriovenous fistula (AVF) aneurysm definitions and clinical implications are summarized as follows: an AVF aneurysm has been defined as enlargement of all 3 vessel layers with a diameter of > 18 mm or roughly 3 times the diameter of the outflow vein of a mature AVF; aneurysms can occur anywhere in the AV access circuit but typically occur in the outflow vein; pseudoaneurysms usually arise from repeated cannulations and, although they develop in AVFs, are more common in arteriovenous grafts (AVGs); most aneurysms/pseudoaneurysms are asymptomatic but can compromise function and cause life‑threatening hemorrhage, with AV access–related fatal hemorrhage reported as 1 for every 1,000 patient-years; diagnosis is by physical examination corroborated with Duplex ultrasound, which can detect per- access fluid, intraluminal thrombus, and inflow/outflow stenoses and quantitate diameter and intra-access flow; it is critical to determine if the lesion is symptomatic and/or at risk for ulceration and rupture, and it is important to have routine, objective measures of growth with greater frequency if worrisome signs or symptoms develop.

### Testosterone (Androgel) [^113ETazt]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Potential for Secondary Exposure to Testosterone

Cases of secondary exposure resulting in virilization of children have been reported in postmarketing surveillance. Signs and symptoms have included enlargement of the penis or clitoris, development of pubic hair, increased erections and libido, aggressive behavior, and advanced bone age. In most cases, these signs and symptoms regressed with removal of the exposure to testosterone gel. In a few cases, however, enlarged genitalia did not fully return to age-appropriate normal size, and bone age remained modestly greater than chronological age. The risk of transfer was increased in some of these cases by not adhering to precautions for the appropriate use of the topical testosterone product. Children and women should avoid contact with unwashed or unclothed application sites in men using AndroGel 1% [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Use in Specific Populations (8.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Inappropriate changes in genital size or development of pubic hair or libido in children, or changes in body hair distribution, significant increase in acne, or other signs of virilization in adult women should be brought to the attention of a physician and the possibility of secondary exposure to testosterone gel should also be brought to the attention of a physician. Testosterone gel should be promptly discontinued until the cause of virilization has been identified.

5.2 Polycythemia

Increases in hematocrit, reflective of increases in red blood cell mass, may require lowering or discontinuation of testosterone. Check hematocrit prior to initiating treatment. It would also be appropriate to re-evaluate the hematocrit 3 to 6 months after starting treatment, and then annually. If hematocrit becomes elevated, stop therapy until hematocrit decreases to an acceptable concentration. An increase in red blood cell mass may increase the risk of thromboembolic events.

### Norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol (Zenchent) [^117QzZr3]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

There is no conclusive evidence that oral contraceptive use is associated with an increase in birth defects, when taken inadvertently during early pregnancy. Previously, a few studies had reported that oral contraceptives might be associated with birth defects, but these studies have not been confirmed. Nevertheless, oral contraceptives or any other drugs should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary and prescribed by your doctor. You should check with your doctor about risks to your unborn child of any medication taken during pregnancy.

2. **While Breastfeeding**:

If you are breastfeeding, consult your doctor before starting oral contraceptives. Some of the drug will be passed on to the child in the milk. A few adverse effects on the child have been reported, including yellowing of the skin (jaundice) and breast enlargement. In addition, oral contraceptives may decrease the amount and quality of your milk. If possible, do not use oral contraceptives while breastfeeding. You should use another method of contraception since breastfeeding provides only partial protection from becoming pregnant and this partial protection decreases significantly as you breastfeed for longer periods of time. You should consider starting oral contraceptives only after you have weaned your child completely.

3. **Laboratory Tests**:

If you are scheduled for any laboratory tests, tell your doctor you are taking birth control pills. Certain blood tests may be affected by birth control pills.

Regarding specific circumstances for endometrial hyperplasia, more specifically with respect to patients with asymptomatic endometrial thickening (further evaluation), SOGC 2024 guidelines recommend to individualize the decision on further investigations in asymptomatic patients with increased endometrial thickening and risk factors for endometrial cancer, such as obesity, hypertension, late menopause, unopposed estrogen use, and genetic cancer risks.

### Enlarged perivascular spaces in infancy and autism diagnosis, cerebrospinal fluid volume, and later sleep problems [^114qSwsn]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Conclusions

This cohort study found that infants who were HL-positive had significantly increased rates of enlarged PVS by age 24 months compared with infants who were HL-negative and LL-negative. Results suggest that enlarged PVS could be a risk factor associated with developing autism, but more studies are needed to determine whether it could be a stratifying marker to differentiate infants with HL who will or will not develop autism themselves. Elevated EA-CSF volumes were observed from age 6 to 24 months in participants who had enlarged PVS by age 24 months, supporting the hypothesis that an accumulation of EA-CSF could be linked with PVS dilation and might provide crucial insight into an underlying mechanism in glymphatic function during infancy. In a subset of participants with school-age sleep data, enlarged PVS at 24 months was associated with higher frequency of night wakings at school-age. Taken together, these results support that enlarged PVS during infancy could be indicative of developmental delays or disorders and have implications for later sleep problems.

Studies of glymphatic function to date have largely focused on aging and neurodegeneration, and this study offers the first examination of the development and function of the glymphatic system in infancy using noninvasive imaging. Beyond neurodegenerative disorders, examining glymphatic function in neurodevelopmental disorders could have a significant impact on early diagnosis and clinical outcomes for children with autism.

### Does the gene matter? Genotype-phenotype and genotype-outcome associations in congenital melanocytic naevi [^117SgKHr]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

The diagnosis of congenital melanocytic naevi (CMN) covers a wide phenotypic spectrum. Small single CMN are very common birthmarks, present in approximately 1% of all neonates, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 are not associated with extracutaneous abnormalities, and have a very low risk of transformation to melanoma. 7, 8, 9, 10 At the other end of the spectrum, multiple CMN (defined as two or more melanocytic naevi at birth) can cover up to 80% of the body surface area, can be associated with serious extracutaneous abnormalities, such as congenital neurological disease, 11, 12, 13, 14 typical facial features, 15 underdevelopment of fat and muscle in naevoid areas, and endocrinological disturbance. 16 The risk of melanoma in childhood varies with the congenital phenotype (both cutaneous and neurological), between 1% and 12% in prospective studies. 13, 17 Where CMN are associated with extracutaneous abnormalities, the term CMN syndrome 15 is preferred to the historical term neurocutaneous melanosis, as the latter does not encompass the whole range of neurological associations, and critically does not distinguish between benign congenital neurological disease, and acquired central nervous system melanoma.

### Birthmarks of medical significance in the neonate [^116siNqh]. Seminars in Perinatology (2013). Low credibility.

Birthmarks are commonplace and most pose no significant detriment to health. It is usual for some 'birthmarks' to manifest within the first weeks to months of life and are not necessarily seen at birth. This is attributed in large part to the maturation of neonatal skin and the deepening of skin color over time. With time, increased pigment production in the skin by melanocytes eventually highlight the differences between normal and abnormal hypopigmented and hyperpigmented anomalies of the skin. Birthmarks can be seen as an isolated skin condition or serve as an important diagnostic aid for other more significant disorders. This review details four of the most common birthmarks regularly encountered in the neonatal period by perinatologists, obstetricians and pediatricians. This review emphasizes their medical significance and highlights any associated underlying systemic disease or genetic syndrome.

### The potential of capillary birthmarks as a significant marker for capillary malformation-arteriovenous malformation syndrome in children who had nontraumatic cerebral hemorrhage [^111BX4EE]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Background/Purpose

Capillary malformation-arteriovenous malformation (CM-AVM) is a new autosomal dominant disorder with cutaneous capillary malformations (CM) and high-flow cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVM). Patients may have Parkes-Weber syndrome. This study determined if cutaneous CM are a significant indicator of CM-AVM in children with cerebral bleeds.

Methods

Children with cerebral AVMs between 1991 and 2009 were reviewed. A family history of brain hemorrhage, AVMs, or cutaneous birthmarks was elicited. Patients and siblings were examined for CM and a family tree recorded. A brief questionnaire determined the family's opinion regarding screening for this syndrome.

Results

Of 30 families, 1 family had Parkes-Weber syndrome. In 3 families, both patient and relatives had CM. In 9 families, patients had no CM, but relatives had them. One family had hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. From the survey, 80% of families would be concerned about vascular marks, and 87% of families would allow screening for cerebral AVMs.

Conclusion

A family history of vascular marks may predict families at risk of having a cerebral AVM with hemorrhage. Most families would agree to screening. However, family history and physical examination alone do not confirm CM-AVM but form a useful screening tool to identify families needing further investigations with genetic testing and/or magnetic resonance imaging.

### Facial involvement in genodermatoses [^113pwtBK]. Clinics in Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Facial involvement represents a characteristic feature of a wide range of genodermatoses. Specific facial findings often help point to the correct diagnosis, which improves counseling and management. In particular, this can facilitate the identification and treatment of associated extracutaneous disease. The highly visible nature of facial lesions in genodermatoses and facial birthmarks can result in stigmatization and frequently leads to particular concern in patients and their family members. It is therefore critical for dermatologists to be aware of the broad spectrum of facial manifestations in genetic skin disease, especially when these findings have important implications with regard to monitoring and treatment. In this contribution, facial involvement in genodermatoses is divided into five morphologic categories based on the most prominent feature: Papules, scaling, photosensitivity/findings associated with aging (eg, telangiectasias, atrophy, lentigines), blisters/erosions, and birthmarks. Hopefully, this will provide a practical and clinically useful approach to a large and diverse assortment of genetic skin conditions.

### Management of difficult infantile haemangiomas [^114Lp6mT]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2012). Low credibility.

Infantile haemangiomas are common vascular tumours of infancy. They typically present shortly after birth, undergo a period of rapid proliferation, and then slowly involute over many years. Although most patients require no intervention, appropriate investigation and treatment may be necessary in a minority of cases. Identifying which patients require further investigation or intervention can be difficult due to the heterogeneity of clinical presentation. This is compounded by a lack of rigorous randomised controlled trials on haemangioma management. Therefore, the rationale for treatment is not always straightforward. Haemangiomas occur anywhere on the body, have superficial, deep or mixed morphology, and depending on anatomic location, size and subtype, can be associated with underlying structural anomalies and many other potential complications. Generally, the management of difficult haemangiomas is best approached on a case-by-case basis. Over the last few years, there have been several advances in our understanding of haemangiomas, together with some exciting new therapeutic options. In the following review, the authors discuss the various possible complications of infantile haemangiomas, the rationale for treatment and appropriate possible interventions.

### Melanoma in congenital melanocytic naevi [^112uid57]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Congenital melanocytic naevus and congenital melanocytic naevus syndrome

A congenital melanocytic naevus (CMN) is an abnormal but benign collection of naevus cells within the skin at birth. Small single CMN are found in 1% of neonates, 1, 2 where small is defined as < 1·5‐cm projected adult size. 3 However, there is a spectrum of size and number of CMN, and in around 1 in 20 000 births an infant is born with a naevus of > 20‐cm‐diameter projected adult size, 4 which is then usually associated with other smaller CMN. In the most severe cutaneous phenotypes, up to 80% of the skin surface area is covered in naevi. The naevi are permanent, and grow in proportion to the child, covering the same anatomical area of skin as is affected at birth.

As with many birthmarks, CMN is the result of a mutation in utero, after the embryo has already begun to develop, and which therefore leads to mosaicism. When the mutation occurs early enough in development it can hit a multipotent progenitor cell, which can lead to multiple CMN on the skin and sometimes to involvement of other organ systems. Thus in patients with multiple CMN, the same mutation has been found in different CMN on the skin, and in melanocytic and nonmelanocytic lesions of the central nervous system (CNS), but not in unaffected skin or blood. 5 Furthermore, such patients can have subtle endocrine dysfunction, 6 characteristic facial features 7 and, very rarely, metabolic bone disease, which has so far always been associated with a co‐occurring epidermal naevus. 8 Where any extracutaneous systems are involved, the term 'CMN syndrome' has been proposed 7 as a more appropriate term than 'neurocutaneous melanosis', as melanosis is only a subset of the congenital neurological abnormalities that can occur in patients with CMN. This terminology brings the condition into line with existing classification of other types of congenital naevi.

### Congenital melanocytic nevi: where are we now? Part I. clinical presentation, epidemiology, pathogenesis, histology, malignant transformation, and neurocutaneous melanosis [^114mjJJV]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Congenital melanocytic nevi (CMN) are present at birth or arise during the first few weeks of life. They are quite common, may have a heritable component, and can present with marked differences in size, shape, color, and location. Histologic and dermatoscopic findings may help suggest the diagnosis, but they are not entirely specific. CMN are categorized based on size, and larger lesions can have a significant psychosocial impact and other complications. They are associated with a variety of dermatologic lesions, ranging from benign to malignant. The risk of malignant transformation varies, with larger CMN carrying a significantly higher risk of malignant melanoma (MM), although with an absolute risk that is lower than is commonly believed. They may also be associated with neuromelanosis, which may be of greater concern than cutaneous MM. The information presented herein aims to help dermatologists determine when it is prudent to obtain a biopsy specimen or excise these lesions, to obtain radiographic imaging, and to involve other specialists (eg, psychiatrists and neurologists) in the patient's care.

### Satellite lesions in congenital melanocytic nevi – time for a change of name [^112EZmPG]. Pediatric Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

The term "satellite lesions" is used in many conditions in dermatology, generally to describe smaller lesions near the edges of a principal lesion. An online medical dictionary gives the definition "a smaller lesion accompanying a main one and situated nearby", and this can apply both macroscopically and microscopically. The implication is that the smaller lesions have spread from the parent lesion. Given this definition and usual understanding of the term its use is not apt in the case of congenital melanocytic nevi (CMN). In the vast majority of cases where the patient is said to have satellite lesions these are not restricted to the area around or near the edge of the principal lesion, and are not necessarily significantly smaller. It seems likely that the early use of the term in this condition is an adaptation of the established and correct use in the context of melanoma. Not only is the term not apt clinically but has no known etiological basis. This leaves us with the question of what to call these lesions in cases of CMN. This proposal is to categorize cases into single or multiple CMN, where multiple is 2 or more nevi of any size at birth. An accurate count or good estimate of the number of lesions at birth should also be recorded, and the largest lesion classified as usual with respect to projected adult size.

### Pulmonary artery enlargement and cystic fibrosis pulmonary exacerbations: a cohort study [^116BgwdR]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

The effects of absent CFTR function have recently been recognized as protean, with CFTR activity recognized in non-epithelial tissues including leukocytes, osteobast, and bronchial smooth muscle –. The latter was associated with small airway sites in swine and human, suggesting clinically relevant smooth muscle constriction due to the absence of CFTR. Interestingly, we found that increased sweat chloride, a marker of CFTR function, was also related to PA enlargement. Mechanistically, this relationship is intriguing for several reasons. First, CFTR channels exist on human lung microvascular cellsand directly cause pulmonary vascular relaxation through CFTR channel activation. Additionally, CFTR mediates vascular tone independent from its role as a chloride channel through other mechanisms including stimulating nitric oxide generation via ATP release, altering lipid trafficking and vascular smooth muscle cell calcium handling, and through increasing expression of vascular growth factors, including VEGF-A. In addition, CFTR SNPs have previously been associated with altered flow mediated dilation and flow velocity in humans. The implications of CFTR dysfunction being pathogenic for pulmonary vascular remodeling and pulmonary hypertension in CF may have prognostic and therapeutic implications. It is possible that novel therapies that restore CFTR function may not only improve lung function in CF, indirectly reducing pulmonary artery pressures, but also may have direct effects on the pulmonary vasculature.

There is no conclusive evidence that oral-contraceptive use is associated with an increase in birth defects, when taken inadvertently during early pregnancy. Previously, a few studies had reported that oral contraceptives might be associated with birth defects, but these studies have not been confirmed. Nevertheless, oral contraceptives should not be used during pregnancy. You should check with your health-care provider about risks to your unborn child of any medication taken during pregnancy.

2. While breast-feeding

If you are breast-feeding, consult your health-care provider before starting oral contraceptives. Some of the drug will be passed on to the child in the milk. A few adverse effects on the child have been reported, including yellowing of the skin (jaundice) and breast enlargement. In addition, oral contraceptives may decrease the amount and quality of your milk. If possible, do not use oral contraceptives while breast-feeding. You should use another method of contraception since breast-feeding provides only partial protection from becoming pregnant and this partial protection decreases significantly as you breast-feed for longer periods of time. You should consider starting oral contraceptives only after you have weaned your child completely.

3. Laboratory tests

If you are scheduled for any laboratory tests, tell your doctor you are taking birth-control pills. Certain blood tests may be affected by birth-control pills.

### The ethnic profile of patients with birthmarks reveals interaction of germline and postzygotic genetics [^112Vb739]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Looking at our patient cohorts we hypothesized that ethnicity may be associated with a phenotype‐modifying effect in this spectrum of diseases. Although ethnicity is a loosely defined classification, it is already known to be clearly associated with self‐resolving dermal melanocytosis (Mongolian blue spots), which is far more common in Afro‐Caribbean than white populations. 4 A bias towards nonwhite ethnicity was suggested in one previous study of PPV, 3 but it was not systematically studied against control populations.

Ethnicity data are collected routinely upon attendance at our hospital, where patients and families choose their own ethnicity from a standard list. We have assumed that there should be no inherent bias in this choice relating to the type of birthmark with which the child presents. Ethnicity data were extracted for all patients seen in our department over a 2‐year period, between March 2011 and March 2013, with a diagnosis of SWS, isolated facial port‐wine stain, congenital melanocytic naevi, congenital epidermal naevi and infantile haemangioma. For the rarer conditions PPV and EDM, where patient numbers were small, we obtained information relating to all patients with the condition rather than restricting our observations to this time period, to maximize the size of this cohort.

A review of the clinical records was used to complete missing data where possible. To ensure that the common occurrence of self‐resolving Mongolian blue spots did not bias our data collection, dermal melanocytosis was considered to be relevant only where it was 'atypical' On the basis of observational studies of normal Mongolian blue spots 4, 5 we have defined this as fulfilling any two of the following criteria: (i) involvement of sites other than only the lumbosacral area, (ii) persistence beyond the first 2 years of life, (iii) areas > 10 cm in diameter at birth and (iv) some areas of accentuated deep pigmentation with clearly defined borders. Examples of the clinical phenotypes for PPV and EDM are shown in Figure 1.

### Consensus statement for the management and treatment of port-wine birthmarks in Sturge-Weber syndrome [^114vrXtr]. JAMA Dermatology (2021). High credibility.

Importance

Sturge-Weber syndrome (SWS) is a neurocutaneous syndrome involving the skin, brain, and eyes. Consensus recommendations for management are lacking.

Objective

To consolidate the current literature with expert opinion to make recommendations that will guide treatment and referral for patients with port-wine birthmarks (PWBs).

Evidence Review

In this consensus statement, 12 nationally peer-recognized experts in dermatology with experience treating patients with SWS were assembled. Key topics and questions were formulated for each group and included risk stratification, optimum treatment strategies, and recommendations regarding light-based therapies. A systematic PubMed search was performed of English-language articles published between December 1, 2008, and December 1, 2018, as well as other pertinent studies identified by the expert panel. Clinical practice guidelines were recommended.

Findings

Treatment of PWBs is indicated to minimize the psychosocial impact and diminish nodularity and potentially tissue hypertrophy. Better outcomes may be attained if treatments are started at an earlier age. In the US, pulsed dye laser is the standard for all PWBs regardless of the lesion size, location, or color. When performed by experienced physicians, laser treatment can be safe for patients of all ages. The choice of using general anesthesia in young patients is a complex decision that must be considered on a case-by-case basis.

Conclusions and Relevance

These recommendations are intended to help guide clinical practice and decision-making for patients with SWS and those with isolated PWBs and may improve patient outcomes.

### Successful treatment of facial port-wine birthmark in a premature infant [^114H6mR9]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Port-wine birthmark (PWB) is a congenital slow-flow capillary malformation of the cutaneous superficial vascular plexus. Occurring in up to 0.5% of newborns, PWB shows no gender predilection and is equally prevalent in premature and full-term infants.PWB appears most often on the face and persists throughout life. At birth, PWB typically presents as a well-defined, bright or deep red patch. With time, it expands commensurate with the child's growth, but has a propensity to become darker, hypertrophic, nodular, and potentially disfiguring, leading to significant functional impairment and psychosocial morbidity later in life.

The current modality of choice for treatment of PWB is high-energy pulsed dye laser (PDL), which selectively targets hemoglobin and results in photocoagulation of the PWB vessels. When performed by a highly trained expert at sufficient frequency, PDL is a safe, effective treatment and successful in most patients, with earlier treatment yielding maximal clearance.

Infants can begin treatment of PWB safely within the first few days after birth as an in-office procedure. Early initiation of PDL therapy during infancy is well-tolerated, provides superior long-term results, and produces a much less evident lesion by the time the child is psychologically aware. However, optimal timing of the initiation of treatment has yet to be established in prematurely born infants.

We present a case of facial PWB in a premature infant who initiated treatment 20 days before his due date using the 595-nm PDL with no adverse effects. This early approach appears to represent a safe treatment option for premature infants with PWB.

### The long-term natural history of geographic atrophy from age-related macular degeneration: enlargement of atrophy and implications for interventional clinical trials [^1122FvHf]. Ophthalmology (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose

To report the enlargement rate of geographic atrophy (GA) over time, its relationship to size of atrophy at baseline and to prior enlargement rate, and the implications for designing future treatment trials for GA.

Design

Prospective natural history study of GA resulting from age-related macular degeneration.

Participants

Two hundred twelve eyes of 131 patients were included in the analysis.

Methods

Annual follow-up included stereo color fundus photographs. The areas of GA were identified and measured, and the rate of enlargement of the atrophy was assessed. Sample sizes for clinical trials using systemic treatment and uniocular treatment were determined.

Main Outcome Measure

Rate of enlargement of the atrophy.

Results

The median overall enlargement rate was 2.1 mm2/year (mean, 2.6 mm2/year). Eyes with larger areas of atrophy at baseline tended to have larger enlargement rates, but knowledge of prior rates of enlargement was the most significant factor in predicting subsequent enlargement rates. There was high concordance between the enlargement rates in the 2 eyes of patients with bilateral GA (correlation coefficient, 0.76). To detect a 25% reduction in enlargement rate for a systemic treatment (alpha, 0.05; power, 0.80; losses to follow-up, 15%), 153 patients each in a control and treatment group would be required for a trial with a 2-year follow-up period for each patient. For a uniocular treatment, 38 patients with bilateral GA would be required, with the untreated eye serving as a control for the treated eye.

Conclusions

Treatment trials for GA with an outcome variable of change in enlargement rate are feasible.

### Melanoma in congenital melanocytic naevi [^111sz5fk]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Small single CMN are common birthmarks with very low risk of melanoma, and do not require routine resection for this reason. Multiple CMN (two or more, of any size or site) can have extracutaneous associations, then termed 'CMN syndrome', and these phenotypes are caused by postzygotic mosaicism for NRAS mutations in 80% of cases. Individuals with multiple CMN do have an increased risk of melanoma, particularly in the presence of congenital neurological abnormalities on screening MRI in the first 6 months of life. Melanoma can arise either in the skin or as a primary in the brain, the latter being more common in our prospective study of affected children, or very rarely in other sites. All forms are usually highly aggressive and fatal. Histopathology by at least two experts in the field, plus genetic analysis of driver mutations and copy number can help to differentiate melanoma from benign proliferative nodules in the skin, or from stable congenital disease in the CNS. Treatment with MEK inhibition on a compassionate basis has shown substantial although temporary signs of symptomatic improvement of disabling neurological symptoms in a small series of patients with CNS melanoma.

### Perinatal determinants of germ-cell testicular cancer in relation to histological subtypes [^116qyetw]. British Journal of Cancer (2002). Low credibility.

Testicular cancer is the most common neoplasm among young adults, with a peak of occurrence among males aged 30 years. The incidence varies 10-fold between countries and has been increasing markedly in several populations in the last 50 years. The trend is a birth cohort phenomenon rather than a calendar period or age effect.

Undescended testis is the only established risk factor apart from heredity and genetic disorders, and the pattern of occurrence of testicular cancer indicates that prenatal life is a critical window for susceptibility to carcinogenic exposures. A number of studies have investigated the role of different indicators of prenatal and perinatal exposures, referring to the hypothesis that the risk for germ-cell testicular cancer is associated with the levels of sex hormones during gestation. Birth order, duration of gestation, birth weight, nausea and bleeding during pregnancy, neonatal jaundice, placental weight and maternal age have been reported as risk factors for testicular cancer by at least one paper, but there is a marked inconsistency.

Most of the studies on testicular cancer have treated the neoplasm as a single entity, while few of them conducted analyses separated by the two major histological groups: seminoma and non-seminoma. In general, results on aetiological heterogeneity between the two types of testicular cancer have not been consistent.

In this study we have combined data from the Swedish Cancer Registry with information from maternity ward charts to perform a nested case–control study of perinatal factors in relation to risk for testicular cancer. The study is an enlargement of a previous investigation, and the aim was to increase statistical power in order to enable separate studies of testicular seminomas and non-seminomas.

### Physiologic changes in vascular birthmarks during early infancy: mechanisms and clinical implications [^114nUsvV]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Vascular birthmarks are the most common birthmarks encountered in newborns. Many dermatologists are unfamiliar with the normal physiologic changes that affect and alter their appearance during early infancy. In this article we discuss normal newborn hemodynamic/neurovascular physiology and the associated clinical findings in neonatal skin. The physiologic anemia of infancy and its resultant effects on skin color and the appearance of vascular birthmarks are detailed. Finally, the pitfalls and obstacles to early diagnosis of vascular birthmarks and the subtle differences between them are reviewed, as are the challenges in assessing response to early pulsed dye laser treatment in the context of the changing vascular physiology.

### Labia minora hypertrophy: causes, impact on women's health, and treatment options [^1166zWrv]. International Urogynecology Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction and Hypothesis

We provide a review of the literature about the onset and development of hypertrophy of the labia minora, together with some expert opinions on the appropriateness of labiaplasty.

Methods

We searched PubMed and used popular search engines, with a greater emphasis on the physiology and hormone-mediated metabolism of these structures, and less emphasis on their surgical treatment.

Results

We describe major embryological, cytological, and biochemical features of this anatomical part and summarize the clinical aspects of its hypertrophy, evaluating types of discomfort reported by women and the medical treatments available. Also, based on what is known about the artificial elongation and spontaneous hypertrophy of the inner labia, we illustrate and discuss the main biological factors that may trigger this medical condition. There are not enough data identifying a clear inheritance of inner labia hypertrophy in the absence of other pathological conditions; instead, we found indirect evidence for an association with transient episodes of local inflammation either before birth or during puberty. We also analyze the role played by estrogen receptors and other factors with regard to the onset of this condition and highlight the importance of their timing in determining the size of women's labia minora. Remarkably, most cases of enlarged labia minora should be considered as outliers that are within the physiological range of size variation described for these structures.

Conclusions

We generally advise against surgical treatment of labia minora, especially in young, pre-pubertal girls, unless specific medical conditions are also present and/or the psychological impact on the patient is deemed particularly negative.

### Satellite lesions in congenital melanocytic nevi – time for a change of name [^111XhbPF]. Pediatric Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

The term 'satellite lesions' is used in many conditions in dermatology, generally to describe smaller lesions near the edges of a principal lesion. An online medical dictionary gives the definition 'a smaller lesion accompanying a main one and situated nearby', and this can apply both macroscopically and microscopically. The implication is that the smaller lesions have spread from the parent lesion.

Given this definition and usual understanding of the term its use is not apt in the case of congenital melanocytic nevi (CMN). In the vast majority of cases where the patient is said to have satellite lesions, these are not restricted to the area around or near the edge of the principal lesion, and are not necessarily significantly smaller. It seems most likely that the use of the term in this condition is an adaptation of the earlier established and still correct use in the context of melanoma, although exactly how its use first arose is not clear. It appears to have come into common usage in the literature around the 1980s.

Furthermore, to think of the 'satellites' as somehow subordinate to the largest CMN is unhelpful in elucidating their etiology. They are melanocytic nevi in their own right and therefore probably represent separate genetic events, at least at the somatic level. A single CMN without any 'satellites' suggests only one genetic event, independent of the size of the CMN; a larger single CMNs could simply be attributable to that single event occurring earlier in fetal development. My view is that the presence of just one 'satellite' is highly significant as it represents two genetic events in one individual. If the incidence of a small CMN is around 1 in 100 births, then the probability of two small CMN arising by chance in one individual is 1 in 10,000, and for 3 this rises to 1 in 1,000,000. More likely is that the presence of more than one CMN is the result of susceptibility to that event. This would also explain why giant CMNs are strongly associated with 'satellites', as any genetic susceptibility would make an early event more likely.

### EHRA / HRS / APHRS / SOLAECE expert consensus on atrial cardiomyopathies: definition, characterization, and clinical implication [^115pdbGQ]. Europace (2016). Medium credibility.

Lone atrial fibrillation (LAF) — epidemiology, risk, and clinical course is described as occurring more often in males than females with a ratio of 3 to 4:1, and true cases can be diagnosed even in subjects older than 60 years. It is unclear whether left atrial (LA) enlargement should exclude LAF, and LA enlargement might even be a consequence of the arrhythmia. LAF is at the lower end of thromboembolic risk with only a 1–2% cumulative 15-year risk of stroke. Clinical course relates to LA size: patients maintaining normal LA size over long-term follow-up show a relatively benign course, whereas those with LA enlargement may experience adverse events like stroke, myocardial infarction, and heart failure. The majority of LAF patients first present with paroxysmal episodes and show low progression rates into permanent atrial fibrillation. Atrial fibrillation has clear genetic determinants, encompassing common gene variants with low predictive strength and rare gene mutations with much greater penetrance, and histologic studies in lone paroxysmal AF have found chronic inflammatory infiltrates, foci of myocyte necrosis, focal replacement fibrosis, and myocyte cytoplasmic vacuoles consistent with myolysis.

### Intrauterine growth and its relationship to size and shape at birth [^114FgYNJ]. Pediatric Research (2002). Low credibility.

Birth size and shape are commonly used as indicators of fetal growth. Epidemiologic studies have suggested a relationship between birth size and the risk of developing cardiovascular disease in later life. Certain "growth phenotypes" have been linked to the development of certain components of cardiovascular disease, particularly babies who display disproportional growth in utero. These observations are based on retrospective analysis of historical data sets. If the "Fetal Origins of Adult Disease" hypothesis is to be generalisable to the present day, then it is essential to establish whether these "growth phenotypes" exist within the normal distribution of birth size. The UCL Fetal Growth Study is a prospective study of antenatal fetal growth assessed by ultrasound at 20 and 30 wk gestation in 1650 low risk, singleton, white pregnancies. Measures of birth size were obtained and analyzed by principal components to explain shape at birth. Birth measures were also related to antenatal growth measurements to determine the strength of ultrasound evaluation in determining subsequent growth. There was significant sexual dimorphism in all measures at birth, with males heavier, longer, and leaner than females. From 20 wk of gestation onwards, males had a significantly larger head size than females. Parity, maternal height, and body mass index were important determinants of birth weight (p < 0.001). Cigarette smoking influenced birth weight, length, and head circumference (p < 0.001) but had no effect on placental size. Principal component analysis revealed that proportionality was the predominant size/shape at birth (55% of variance explained). A further 18% of variance was explained by a contrast between weight, head circumference, and length versus three skinfolds. Anthropometric measures as assessed by ultrasound at 20 and 30 wk gestation were poor predictors of birth length, weight, and head circumference (adjusted R(2) 18, 40, and 28% at 30 wk gestation scan, respectively). These predictions were not improved by including growth patterns between 20 and 30 wk. There is sexual dimorphism in a number of anthropometric measures at birth and in utero. These sex differences are important determinants of body size and shape. In a low risk population delivering at term, body shape was largely determined by proportionality between anthropometric measures. The low correlations between antenatal measures and birth size suggest that it is unwise to ascribe birth shape phenotypes to adverse events at any particular stage of gestation. The weak relationship also suggests that routine antenatal scans around 30 wk of gestation to predict growth problems are unlikely to be of benefit in the majority of cases.

### Rapidly enlarging nontender lesion on a child's face [^115woH15]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Case description

An otherwise well 7-year-old Caucasian female presented to a dermatology outpatient clinic with a 2-month history of a rapidly enlarging non-tender nodule on the right cheek which measured approximately 1 cm. This patient had no medical history and was not on any medications. Two weeks later the lesion had grown to measure approximately 3 cm and significant erosion was noted (Fig 1). She was referred to plastic surgery for urgent excision. Representative image of histopathology is shown (Fig 2).

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?
A. Spitz nevus
B. Pilomatricoma
C. Giant molluscum contagiosum
D. Amelanotic melanoma
E. Keratoacanthoma

Answers:
A. Spitz Nevus – Incorrect. Spitz nevi typically present in children as dome-shaped papules or nodules on the face and extremities, with colors ranging from pink, tan, to dark brown or black. Atypical spitz nevi can be very large with rapid growth, involvement of deep dermis and subcutis, and ulceration. Pathology demonstrates nests of epithelioid and/or spindled melanocytes.
B. Pilomatricoma – Correct. Pilomatricoma is a benign cutaneous adnexal tumor that originates from cells in the matrices of hair follicles. Typical lesions are round, mobile, firm, and surrounded by overlying skin. Pilomatricomas often exhibit calcification, causing them to feel hard or irregular upon palpation. Giant pilomatricomas are rare, greater than 5 cm in diameter, and are more common in females. Histopathology shows characteristic findings of basaloid cells and eosinophilic "ghost cells".
C. Giant molluscum contagiosum – Incorrect. Molluscum contagiosum is a common childhood infection caused by poxvirus. Lesions typically present as multiple smooth papules with central umbilication. Giant molluscum is associated with HIV infection and immunosuppression. Henderson-Patterson bodies on histology are pathognomonic.
D. Amelanotic melanoma – Incorrect. Amelanotic melanomas typically appear skin-colored or erythematous and account for a significant proportion of childhood melanomas. Pediatric melanoma is rare, and affected patients often have risk factors such as large/giant congenital nevi or genetic predisposition. Histopathology shows malignant melanocytes with decreased or complete absence of pigment.
E. Keratoacanthoma – Incorrect. Keratoacanthomas are cutaneous tumors which present as solitary nodules with a centralized keratin-filled crater. These tumors are more common in middle-aged or older adults but can present in childhood in the context of genetic disorders such as multiple self-healing squamous epitheliomas and xeroderma pigmentosum.

### Vascular characteristics of port wine birthmarks as measured by dynamic optical coherence tomography [^114ygCvS]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Port wine birthmarks (PWBs) are congenital capillary malformations. Vessel characteristics, such as diameter and depth, may impact presentation and outcomes. They can be imaged using dynamic optical coherence tomography, a high-resolution, noninvasive imaging method.

Purpose

We conducted a cross-sectional observational study to measure in vivo vascular characteristics as a function of PWB color.

Methods

Patients undergoing treatment for PWB were recruited from 3 sites. PWBs were classified by color. Dynamic optical coherence tomography images with calculations were obtained.

Results

One hundred eight patients were enrolled. Mean age correlated with PWB color, with birthmarks being lighter in younger patients and darker in older patients (P < .01). Mean superficial plexus depth was significantly shallower in purple PWBs than in pink PWBs. Color was not associated with significant differences in mean superficial vessel density or diameter. Among pink PWBs, each 10-year increase in age was associated with a 10.6-μm increase in superficial plexus depth. Among purple PWBs, each 10-year increase in age was associated with a 16.2-μm reduction in superficial plexus depth. In lesions without prior treatment, vessel density was 12.7% lower in purple PWBs than in pink PWBs.

Conclusion

Superficial vessels of purple PWBs were significantly closer to the epidermis than those of pink PWBs, which might impact optimal laser parameters.

### Longitudinal adrenal gland measurements and growth trajectories as risk markers for late preterm delivery [^114zVu8u]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The fetal adrenal gland receives rising awareness as a predictor of spontaneous preterm birth. We hereby provide longitudinal growth assessments of the fetal adrenal gland in a low risk population with an additional focus on trajectories in fetuses born preterm.

Methods

Fetal adrenal gland was assessed via transabdominal ultrasound at gestational weeks (gw) 24–26, 28–30, and 34–36 in a low-risk pregnancy cohort. Longitudinal trajectories of the total gland and the mark (so called fetal zone) as well as ratio of fetal zone width/ total widths (w/W) were analyzed using repeated ANOVA analyses. To compare trajectories of the ratio w/W for preterm and term fetuses respectively, as well as women with and without clinical signs of preterm labor, the propensity score method was applied.

Results

Fetal zone width increased over the course of pregnancy (p < 0.0001), while the ratio w/W decreased (p < 0.0001) (n = 327). Comparing the trajectories of the ratio w/W in fetuses born preterm (n = 11) with propensity-score matched term born fetuses (n = 22), a decrease between gw 24–26 and 28–30 was observed in both groups, which continued to decrease for the term born fetuses. However, in preterm born fetuses, the ratio increased above the term born values at gw 34–36.

Conclusion

Our study provides for the first time longitudinal growth data on the fetal adrenal gland and supports the hypothesis that fetal zone enlargement is associated with preterm birth which could play an important role in risk-prediction.

### Subdural hemorrhage in pediatric patients with enlargement of the subarachnoid spaces [^111c5VJ5]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Object

Enlargement of the subarachnoid spaces has been theorized as a risk factor for the development of subdural hemorrhage (SDH). As the finding of unexplained SDH in children often raises suspicion for nonaccidental trauma, the possibility of increased risk of SDH in children with enlargement of the subarachnoid spaces has important clinical, social, and legal implications. Therefore, the authors evaluated the frequency of SDH in a cohort of children with enlargement of the subarachnoid spaces.

Methods

The authors identified children younger than 2 years of age who were diagnosed with enlargement of the subarachnoid spaces on MRI or CT scanning in a large primary care network between July 2001 and January 2008. The authors excluded children who had enlargement of the subarachnoid spaces diagnosed on imaging performed for trauma or developmental delay, as well as children with a history of prematurity, diagnosis of intracranial pathology, or metabolic or genetic disorders. Chart review recovered the following data: patient demographics, head circumference, history of head trauma, and head imaging results. For the subset of children with SDH, information regarding evaluation for other injuries, including skeletal survey, ophthalmological examination, and child protection team evaluation, was abstracted.

Results

There were 177 children with enlargement of the subarachnoid spaces who met the inclusion criteria. Subdural hemorrhage was identified in 4 (2.3%) of the 177 children. All of the children with SDH underwent evaluations for suspected nonaccidental trauma, which included consultation by the child protection team, skeletal survey, and ophthalmological examination. Additional injuries (healing rib fractures) were identified in 1 of 4 patients. None of the 4 children had retinal hemorrhages. Only the child with rib fractures was reported to child protective services due to concerns for abuse.

Conclusions

Only a small minority of the patients with enlargement of the subarachnoid spaces had SDH. Evidence of additional injuries concerning for physical abuse were identified in a quarter of the children with enlargement of the subarachnoid spaces and SDH, suggesting that an evaluation for suspected nonaccidental trauma including occult injury screening should be performed in cases of SDH with enlargement of the subarachnoid spaces. In the absence of additional injuries, however, the presence of an unexplained SDH in the setting of enlargement of the subarachnoid spaces may be insufficient to support a diagnosis of nonaccidental trauma.

### Germline melanocortin-1-receptor genotype is associated with severity of cutaneous phenotype in congenital melanocytic nevi: a role for MC1R in human fetal development [^113H2Q3P]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

MC1R variants are a risk factor for melanoma development in the general population and are associated with increased risk of melanoma in CDKN2A mutation carriers. One important clinical consideration in our patient cohort is whether the pattern of germline MC1R genotype is responsible for the excess risk of malignant melanoma in individuals with CMN. The lifetime risk for melanoma is around 1–2% when all CMN are considered together as a group, which is similar in magnitude to the excess risk associated with MC1R variants in the normal population. The numbers of melanomas in our CMN cohort are too few to allow detailed investigations on the risk of melanoma attributable to MC1R variants, but it is likely that this genotype is at least contributing to melanoma risk. In a recent family-based melanoma study, the odds ratio for melanoma in CDKN2A mutation carriers was 5.67 (95% CI 2.1–15.29) for subjects with MC1R variants; thus, it is possible that the MC1R genotype may similarly alter the risk of melanoma in people with larger CMNs.

In conclusion, we have identified associations between CMN and red-hair/ MC1R variants. Furthermore, the presence of a V92M or R allele was associated with larger CMN size and with larger birth weight in the CMN, and separately in the ALSPAC, groups consistent with a growth-promoting effect of these alleles during embryogenesis.

### Urogenital hiatus closure: facts, fallacies, and why a unified theory of hiatal failure is needed [^114wj51D]. International Urogynecology Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Interaction Between Prolapse and the Urogenital Hiatus Over the Lifespan is Complex

In seeking to understand the factors involved in hiatal enlargement, stresses placed on the urogenital hiatus during a woman's lifespan should be kept in mind. The images in Fig. 8 show urogenital hiatus changes over 31 years. Panels a and b show the urogenital hiatus at rest and strain in a woman in 1991, a year after delivering her fourth baby (weighing 10 lb. 14 oz.), while panels c and d show its status three decades later (2022). No intervening treatment was undertaken. Note that in 1991, the slightly enlarged urogenital hiatus is expanded by straining. In 2022, the resting urogenital hiatus A-P diameter is about 60% larger at rest and 40% larger during strain.

Fig. 8
Hiatus at rest and strain in 1991 (a, b) compared to 2022 (c, d). The black line in a and b indicate hiatus size. In c and d, the 1991 dimension is shown in black and enlargement beyond that is indicated by red

Implications

The urogenital hiatus is typically evaluated at one point in time during a woman's lifespan, but aging effects need to be considered. There is a paradox between the progressive enlargement with advancing age seen in this figure and the small, tight urogenital hiatus found in many parous elderly women. So for the situation shown in the 1991 images with a slightly enlarged urogenital hiatus, the hiatus expands with advancing age (2022 images), but in other women without an injury, age does not result in hiatal enlargement. This observation calls attention to our superficial understanding of the dynamic interplay between age-related changes and changes that occur with advancing age in women who sustained injury during birth. We hypothesize that an enlarged urogenital hiatus allows the vaginal walls to descend and further stretch the surrounding muscles and connective tissue due to repetitive loading. This is supported by the observation that some women using a pessary experience significant reduction of their urogenital hiatus size when the dilating effect of the prolapse is eliminated.

### Satellite lesions in congenital melanocytic nevi – time for a change of name [^116MRobP]. Pediatric Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

This leaves us with the question of what to call these lesions in cases of CMNs. I propose that we simply categorize cases into single or multiple CMNs, where multiple is two or more nevi of any size at birth. An accurate count or good estimate of the number and range of size of lesions at birth should also be recorded, as it has already been shown that the number of lesions is linked to the incidence of neurologic complications. Current classification in our practice is 0–10 (exact number should be noted), 10–20, 20–50, 50–100, 100–200, and > 200 lesions. The largest lesion should then be classified as usual with respect to Projected Adult Size. The importance of the classification being based on the clinical picture at birth is that this condition evolves variably with age, with some patients never developing further nevi and others developing large numbers for many years. New counts/estimates of the number of lesions should be made at each follow-up.

Traditionally the term 'multiple CMNs' has been reserved for cases where no individual lesion is larger than the others. Under this new classification these cases would remain part of the larger group of multiple CMNs and would be identified by number and size of lesions.

The proposed correction of terminology may improve reproducibility between clinicians by encouraging more accurate recording of the number and size of lesions at a standardized age, and may therefore lead to an improvement in our ability to identify those at highest risk of complications.

### A histological snapshot of hypothetical multistep progression from nevus sebaceus to invasive syringocystadenocarcinoma papilliferum [^115kvz75]. The American Journal of Dermatopathology (2016). Low credibility.

Syringocystadenocarcinoma papilliferum (SCACP) is an extremely rare adnexal neoplasm, believed to arise in a preexisting nevus sebaceus of Jadassohn (NSJ) through a multistep progression process. This hypothetical process involves an NSJ giving rise to syringocystadenoma papilliferum, which then presumably undergoes malignant transformation in rare circumstances to give rise to SCACP in situ, which finally progresses to an invasive SCACP. Of the 30 SCACP cases reported so far, none have documented the process from a birthmark to the final invasive lesion, with histological evidence of each step, in a single tumor. Here, the authors report just such a case. A 74-year-old man presented with a recently enlarging birthmark on the scalp. Excisional biopsy showed an invasive SCACP, in the background of SCACP in situ, syringocystadenoma papilliferum, and NSJ. Furthermore, this tumor showed a concurrent pigmented trichoblastoma and histological evidence of lymphovascular invasion, events that have not been documented with SCACP. Interestingly, all these component lesions were present on a single histological section of this solitary tumor. Regional lymph node metastasis, a rare occurrence in SCACP, was also present in this remarkable case. The authors discuss the implications of these findings in light of the review of relevant literature.

Conclusions

The changes in CPV among fetuses with isolated VM were assessed using fetal neuro-ultrasound, and these alterations were found to be correlated with the progression of lateral ventricle enlargement. This discovery holds potential implications for prenatal counseling and clinical management strategies in cases involving fetuses with isolated VM. The forthcoming investigation will encompass an exploration of the clinical implications associated with altered CPV in fetuses, specifically focusing on its impact on the neurodevelopment of newborns.

### Update: consequences of abnormal fetal growth [^113SFAXQ]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) is prevalent worldwide and affects children and adults in multiple ways. These include predisposition to type 2 diabetes mellitus, the metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease, persistent reduction in stature, and possibly changes in the pattern of puberty. A review of recent literature confirms that the metabolic effects of being born small for gestational age are evident in the very young, persist with age, and are amplified by adiposity. Furthermore, the pattern of growth in the first few years of life has a significant bearing on a person's later health, with those that show increasing weight gain being at the greatest risk for future metabolic dysfunction. Treatment with exogenous human GH is used to improve height in children who remain short after being small for gestational age at birth, but the response of individuals remains variable and difficult to predict. The mechanisms involved in the metabolic programming of IUGR children are just beginning to be explored. It appears that IUGR leads to widespread changes in DNA methylation and that specific "epigenetic signatures" for IUGR are likely to be found in various fetal tissues. The challenge is to link such alterations with modifications in gene expression and ultimately the metabolic abnormalities of adulthood, and it represents one of the frontiers for research in the field.

Conclusions and Future Work

Infants born LGA show increased fetal biometry and adiposity measures and increased growth trajectories, from as early as 20 weeks' gestation. Antenatal interventions to prevent LGA have potentially started too late to alter fetal growth and growth trajectories. Preconception interventions are an important next step.

### Testosterone (testim) [^1164fVNQ]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Potential for Secondary Exposure to Testosterone

Cases of secondary exposure resulting in virilization of children have been reported in postmarketing surveillance. Signs and symptoms have included enlargement of the penis or clitoris, development of pubic hair, increased erections and libido, aggressive behavior, and advanced bone age. In most cases, these signs and symptoms regressed with removal of the exposure to testosterone gel. In a few cases, however, enlarged genitalia did not fully return to age-appropriate normal size, and bone age remained modestly greater than chronological age. The risk of transfer was increased in some of these cases by not adhering to precautions for the appropriate use of the topical testosterone product. Children and women should avoid contact with unwashed or unclothed application sites in men using TESTIM [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Use in Specific Populations (8.1), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Inappropriate changes in genital size or development of pubic hair or libido in children, or changes in body hair distribution, significant increase in acne, or other signs of virilization in adult women should be brought to the attention of a physician and the possibility of secondary exposure to testosterone gel should also be brought to the attention of a physician. Testosterone gel should be promptly discontinued until the cause of virilization has been identified.

5.2 Polycythemia

Increases in hematocrit, reflective of increases in red blood cell mass, may require lowering or discontinuation of testosterone. Check hematocrit prior to initiating treatment. It would also be appropriate to re-evaluate the hematocrit 3 to 6 months after starting treatment, and then annually. If hematocrit becomes elevated, stop therapy until hematocrit decreases to an acceptable concentration. An increase in red blood cell mass may increase the risk of thromboembolic events.

### Nevus simplex: a reconsideration of nomenclature, sites of involvement, and disease associations [^116R9YVg]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Nevus simplex (NS) is a common birthmark on the forehead, glabella, upper eyelids, and nape. More widespread involvement can be confused with port-wine stains (nevus flammeus) and other vascular birthmarks.

Objectives

To further categorize the anatomic locations in infants with extensive NS and evaluate for any possible disease associations.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective review of patients with extensive NS seen at two tertiary care centers.

Results

Twenty-seven patients with extensive NS were identified. All had at least one typical site of involvement: glabella (77.8%), nape (59.3%), and eyelids (55.6%). Additional sites were the scalp, including the vertex, occiput, parietal (66.7%); nose (66.7%); lip (59.2%); lumbosacral skin (55.6%); and upper and mid back (14.8%).

Limitations

Retrospective nature of the study and relatively small sample size.

Conclusions

We propose the term "nevus simplex complex" for NS with more widespread involvement beyond the typical sites. Consistent use of the term "nevus simplex" will aid in correct diagnosis and appropriate management of these birthmarks.

### The management of periorbital fat excess in haemangioma involution [^112KGCR5]. Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive & Aesthetic Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Haemangioma of infancy is a common birthmark. As spontaneous involution is the rule, it is usually treated conservatively. Periorbital haemangiomata may require intervention if symptomatic and this may be early or late, where plastic surgery may be required. It has not previously been recognised that deep periorbital lesions may lead to a baggy appearance of the eyelids because of excess fatty tissue. The management of this condition is described in different clinical presentations illustrated by three female patients with a history of infantile periorbital haemangioma. Two were treated by blepharoplasty, during which an excess of fatty tissue was found, deep to the orbital septum. Birthmark stigmata were eradicated and symmetry was achieved.

### Management of stroke in neonates and children: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^116EGyGs]. Stroke (2019). High credibility.

Controversies in current practice for evaluation of childhood stroke — key positions state that brainstem CMs in children should generally be observed; asymptomatic, incidentally discovered arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) should be considered for treatment in most children; and genetic screening should be considered in children with pial AVF, AVM, or CM if there is a suggestive family history, multiple or unusually complex malformations, or vascular birthmarks on examination.

### International consensus guideline on small for gestational age: etiology and management from infancy to early adulthood [^111nX682]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Box 1.
Definitions.

Being born SGA is defined as having a birth weight and/or birth length below −2 SDS for gestational age.
Catch-up growth in height is defined as a growth rate (cm/year) of > 0 SDS, ie, more than the median for chronological age and sex.
Appropriate catch-up growth in height is defined as growing into the normal height range, taking into account the mid-parental height.
Short stature is defined as a height below −2.0 SDS for age and sex.

There was full agreement on these definitions among the taskforce members.

### In patients who had a stroke or TIA, enlarged perivascular spaces in basal ganglia may cause future haemorrhagic strokes [^112p7LFq]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

BG-EPVS was associated with the development of haemorrhagic stroke within 1 year after AIS/TIA. The robustness of this relationship and potential clinical implication in predicting and preventing recurrent haemorrhagic stroke in this patient population should be further explored in a larger cohort.

### Localization of white matter volume increase in autism and developmental language disorder [^116EXySv]. Annals of Neurology (2004). Low credibility.

Increased brain volume in autism appears to be driven mainly by an unexplained white matter enlargement, and we have reported a similar phenomenon in developmental language disorder (DLD). Localization of this enlargement would strongly guide research into its cause, tissue basis, and functional implications. We utilized a white matter parcellation technique that divides cerebral white matter into an outer zone containing the radiate compartment and an inner zone containing sagittal and bridging system compartments. In both high-functioning autism and DLD, enlargement localized to the radiate white matter (all lobes in autism, all but parietal in DLD), whereas inner zone white matter compartments showed no volume differences from controls. Furthermore, in both autism and DLD, later or longer-myelinating regions showed greater volume increases over controls. Neither group showed cerebral cortex, corpus callosum, or internal capsule volume differences from control. Radiate white matter myelinates later than deep white matter; this pattern of enlargement thus is consistent with striking postnatal head circumference percentile increases reported in autism. These findings suggest an ongoing postnatal process in both autism and DLD that is probably intrinsic to white matter, that primarily affects intrahemispheric and corticocortical connections, and that places these two disorders on the same spectrum.

### Germline melanocortin-1-receptor genotype is associated with severity of cutaneous phenotype in congenital melanocytic nevi: a role for MC1R in human fetal development [^1115gSNg]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Congenital melanocytic nevi (CMN) are pigmented birthmarks that affect up to 80% of the skin surface area. The increased frequency of CMN in families of severely affected individuals is suggestive of a predisposing germline genotype. We noted a high prevalence of red hair in affected families, and considered a role for MC1R in this condition. A cohort of 166 CMN subjects underwent pigmentary phenotyping, with MC1R genotyping in 113. Results were compared with a local control group of 60 unrelated children and with 300 UK children without CMN. CMN subjects had higher prevalences of red hair and a red-haired parent than local controls and had a higher rate of compound heterozygosity and homozygosity for MC1R variants. The presence of a V92M or R allele (D84E, R151C, R160W, D294H) was associated with increasing size of the CMN, implying a growth-promoting effect of these alleles. Unexpectedly, the V92M and R151C alleles were also strongly associated with birth weight in the CMN cohort, a finding confirmed in the control group. The effect of germline MC1R genotype on development and severity of CMN led us to investigate potential broader effects on growth, revealing a role for MC1R in normal fetal development.

### International consensus guideline on small for gestational age: etiology and management from infancy to early adulthood [^112EtZHi]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Growth

As a group, children born SGA do not achieve their genetic height potential, falling on average 1 SD below mid-parental height/target height. At least 90% of children born SGA show spontaneous catch-up growth into the normal height range (> −2 SDS) during childhood. Catch-up growth is generally defined as a sustained growth rate (cm/year) > 0 SDS, that is, more than the median for chronological age and sex. Sufficient catch-up is arbitrarily defined as growing into the normal height range. This process is more pronounced during the first 6 months and usually completed within the first 2 years of life, in which 85% of children show catch-up growth to a normal length. Catch-up might take longer in infants born preterm and SGA, up to the age of 4 years. Children born SGA with a height below −2 SDS at the age of 3 years, have a 7-fold increased risk of remaining short, whereas those born SGA with a birth weight below −2 SDS have a 5-fold increased risk. The reasons for insufficient catch-up growth in children born SGA are poorly understood. Factors that positively influence childhood growth include female sex, multiple birth, taller parents, and more rapid gain in length during early life.

### Abnormal fetal growth: intrauterine growth retardation, small for gestational age, large for gestational age [^11642rmm]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

The two extremes of abnormal fetal growth are restricted growth and excessive growth, both of which originate from alterations in the uterine metabolic milieu. The fetus must adapt to these conditions to survive. In both instances, however, the inciting insult and the subsequent adaptation of the fetus carry long-term health consequences. In some instances, these changes may have generational implications. Counseling and care by pediatricians should be directed at the continuum of age ranges, including the expectant mother, the newborn, the child and adolescent, and future generations.

### An unusual presentation of a vascular birthmark: a focal area of congenital lipoatrophy on the buttock [^111CNy74]. Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive & Aesthetic Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

A 3-year-old girl presented with a focal area of congenital lipoatrophy on the buttock. There was no history of trauma or injections to the site. An excisional biopsy of the lesion was performed. The pathology of the lesion was most consistent with a vascular malformation with capillary predominance. This is an unusual presentation of a capillary malformation that has not been reported in the literature. The normal clinical presentation, natural history, pathologic findings, and imaging findings of capillary malformations are reviewed. These characteristics are compared to other easily confused lesions, such as haemangiomas, including infantile, rapidly-involuting, and non-involuting haemangiomas. Usually, the clinical appearance of congenital vascular lesions confers the ability to correctly distinguish these birthmarks. However, as this case demonstrates, the possibility of a vascular lesion should be considered with any congenital cutaneous lesion regardless of its appearance.

### Endocrine and metabolic consequences of intrauterine growth retardation [^116aYZ3p]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

Size at birth and early infancy growth rates have been linked to long-term risks for diseases, such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. These associations could be explained by permanent programming of metabolic responses and selective survival of those genetically predisposed to such adaptations. These epidemiologic associations may also affect long-term disease risk in short small-for-gestational age children, who are often treated with growth hormone. Study of the mechanisms and genetic factors involved in the association between small size at birth, rapid postnatal weight gain, and adult disease may promote the early identification of subjects with the highest disease risk and new opportunities to develop targeted early interventions.

### Optimal fetal growth for the caucasian singleton and assessment of appropriateness of fetal growth: an analysis of a total population perinatal database [^116JZoTD]. BMC Pediatrics (2005). Low credibility.

(ii) Birth much before term often has a pathological cause that also influences fetal growth. Thus the distributions of birth weights delivered at preterm gestations are no longer Gaussian, but typically, because pathological restriction occurs much more frequently than acceleration, are negatively skewed. Thus weights of neonates born at preterm gestations tend to be lower than fetuses of the same gestational age who go on to deliver at term.

In this study we address (i) by using the best estimate of gestational age that can be derived from all available data and to exclude the '4-week errors' arising from gestational break-through bleeding. If we have succeeded in excluding pregnancies exposed to factors known to pathologically affect fetal growth we have addressed (ii), though the cost is the exclusion of a disproportionate number of infants born preterm, particularly very preterm, as can be seen in Table 2. The observation that the POBWs of the percentile positions are independent of gestational age, Figure 2, indicates that the dispersion is proportional to the mean across gestational age, and is compatible with both (i) and (ii) having been successfully addressed.

Selection of independent variables

Some may consider our selection of predictor variables incomplete as it does not include measures of paternal size, maternal weight or maternal weight gain.

Paternal size

While paternal size is known to influence fetal growth it was not included because the biological father cannot routinely be identified and therefore measures of paternal size are not available on our database. The proportion of variability accounted for by the regression equations would, no doubt, be increased by the inclusion of paternal height as an independent variable.

Maternal weight

It has been suggested that maternal size affects fetal growth because it correlates with the area of uterine endometrium available for placentation. Since this area is not directly measurable, it is logical to seek and adjust for the maternal dimension(s) that correlates most closely with it. Maternal height measures skeletal size in the vertical dimension only, while maternal weight is associated with skeletal size and soft tissue mass, including adipose tissue. Skeletal height tends to correlate with skeletal size, but the proportion of weight consisting of soft tissue, particularly adipose tissue, is very variable, weakening the correlation between maternal weight and skeletal size. Data from the 5 month Dutch famine suggest that maternal pre-natal weight for height, a measure of soft tissue mass, is not a strong determinant of birth weight. We therefore suggest that maternal height is likely to correlate better with the uterine area available for placentation than is prenatal maternal weight or weight for height.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of infantile hemangiomas [^111qVXix]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Infantile hemangiomas (IHs) — early growth and monitoring emphasize that early and frequent monitoring in the first few weeks and months of life is crucial in identifying those IHs that require intervention because IHs may change rapidly during this time period, and that most rapid IH growth occurs between 1 and 3 months of age. There is a window of opportunity to treat problematic IHs; consult early (by 1 month of age) for lesions that are potentially high risk because of associations including potential for disfigurement (the most common reason treatment is needed), life-threatening complications, functional impairment, ulceration, and underlying abnormalities. Although IHs involute, this process may be incomplete, leaving permanent skin changes that may be life altering, and this is especially true for IHs that are thick.

### Size of facial port-wine birthmark may predict neurologic outcome in Sturge-Weber syndrome [^116a4Vk3]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine whether the size of the birthmark in patients with Sturge-Weber syndrome (SWS) who have brain involvement can help predict neurologic disability.

Study Design

Fifty-one patients with SWS with facial birthmarks and brain involvement documented on magnetic resonance imaging were included in this retrospective chart review. A neuroradiologist, blinded to all clinical information, assigned a previously validated SWS neuroimaging score. A pediatric neurologist prospectively assigned previously validated neurologic severity scores, based on seizures, hemiparesis, visual field cut, and cognitive impairments. Three raters, blinded to clinical scores, independently graded the size of facial birthmark in each patient based on photographs. Their scores were averaged. Birthmark scores were compared with the imaging and neurologic severity results using nonparametric correlation analysis.

Results

Size of facial port-wine birthmark correlates with magnetic resonance imaging scores on the left and right sides (ρ = 0.57 and 0.66 [P < .001], respectively). Size is also positively associated with the neurologic severity rating for patients age 6 years and above (1-sided Fisher exact, P = 0.032).

Conclusions

The size of facial port-wine birthmark in SWS brain involvement can be developed as a tool to predict neurologic severity of the disease.

### Longitudinal adrenal gland measurements and growth trajectories as risk markers for late preterm delivery [^115oxBRN]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Preterm delivery (< 37 weeks) still remains the leading cause of perinatal morbidity and mortality in developed countries of which the majority of cases are late preterm infants (occurring between 34 and 37 weeks). Although the detailed mechanisms of the parturition process and preterm birth remains elusive, intervention strategies have recently been introduced. Unfortunately, we still lack accurate predictors of preterm birth.

It is well known, that the fetal adrenal gland plays an important role in parturition. As part of the fetal adrenocortical axis it is involved in the general fetal stress response.

A number of cross-sectional acquired reference ranges have been proposed for total adrenal gland size and the distinction between the adrenal mark (called fetal zone) and the adrenal cortex. However, none of them was based on repeated longitudinal assessments or individual growth trajectories of the fetal adrenal gland.

Against this background previous studies investigated the suitability/usefulness of various ultrasound measurements of the adrenal gland for predicting preterm birth primarily in women with signs of preterm labour or premature rupture of membranes (PROM).

Looking at the volume of the whole adrenal gland, Turan and colleagues found larger volumes in women who gave birth within the next 5 days compared to those who did not and described that predominantly the fetal zone increases in size. The ratio between the fetal zone and the whole adrenal gland could accurately distinguish between patients with symptoms of preterm birth who delivered within the next week and those who did not with high sensitivity and specificity. The groups of Santipap et al. as well as Agarwal reported that in patients with either threatened preterm labour or preterm labour an enlarged adrenal gland in combination with high levels of placental alpha macroglobulin-1 or cervical elastography respectively was effective in predicting preterm delivery within 7 days. The adrenal gland ratio was reported to be independent of gestational age and is therefore particular useful for screening.

In contrast, in a large multicenter observational cohort study of asymptomatic nulliparous women, cross-sectional adrenal gland measurements failed to identify preterm delivery.

The aim of this study was to provide longitudinal assessments of the fetal adrenal gland in a low risk population. Additionally, taking advantage of our carefully and repeatedly collected data, we aim to test the hypothesis of fetal adrenal zone enlargement prior to (preterm) birth. In order to do so, in a secondary analysis, fetal adrenal gland trajectories were assessed separately for a small subsample of preterm and term born neonates as well as women with and without preterm labor.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for intrauterine growth restriction, more specifically with respect to ultrasound follow-up, RCOG 2013 guidelines recommend to obtain serial ultrasound measurement of fetal size and assessment of wellbeing with umbilical artery Doppler:

- if the fetal abdominal circumference or estimated fetal weight is < 10th centile or there is evidence of reduced growth velocity

- from 26–28 weeks of gestation in the presence of a major risk factor - odds ratio > 2.0

- from 26–28 weeks of gestation in the presence of an abnormal uterine artery Doppler at 20–24 weeks, defined as a pulsatility index > 95th centile, and/or notching

- in case of fetal echogenic bowel.

### Urogenital hiatus closure: facts, fallacies, and why a unified theory of hiatal failure is needed [^1178wHQV]. International Urogynecology Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Levator Ani Damage Alone Does Not Explain an Enlarged Urogenital Hiatus

Damage to the levator ani is clearly associated with an enlarged urogenital hiatus and pelvic organ prolapse; however, it explains less than 20% of hiatal enlargement. The examples shown in Fig. 4 present the paradox of a woman with a perfectly normal urogenital hiatus both at rest and at strain who has a bilateral avulsion seen on MRI versus a woman with a greatly enlarged urogenital hiatus and large prolapse with an intact levator ani.

Fig. 4
A woman with a normal hiatus during rest (a) and strain (b) with bilateral levator avulsion (c, yellow arrows) and a woman with an enlarged hiatus during rest (d) and strain (e) with intact levator muscles (f, black arrows)

Implications

This paradox illustrates that levator ani muscle avulsion, although clearly associated with pelvic organ prolapse, is alone not sufficient to explain hiatal enlargement. Instead, it must be considered in the wider context of failure of the other components in the perineal complex.

Childhood hemorrhagic stroke — arteriovenous fistula (AVF) and cavernous malformation (CM) management includes that AVFs are treated in children with embolization as first-line therapy in most cases, followed by surgery in select cases, with observation appropriate in some cases; symptomatic or enlarging supratentorial or cerebellar CMs can be assessed for treatment with surgical resection; careful skin examinations for vascular birthmarks indicating an underlying genetic syndrome are helpful; and screening for the presence of a thrombus should be performed for dural AVFs not related to trauma.

### Standards of care for the health of transgender and gender diverse people, version 8 [^114SG7TV]. International Journal of Transgender Health (2022). High credibility.

Gender-affirming medical interventions for nonbinary people — when a particular intervention lacks established precedent, it is important that before the intervention is considered, the individual is provided with an overview of the available information, including recognition of potential knowledge limits, and it is equally important to undertake and document a comprehensive discussion of the physical changes needed and the potential limitations in achieving those attributes, including whether an intervention may or may not enhance gender expression. For estrogen therapy in nonbinary people assigned male at birth (AMAB), it is important to note the possibility of breast growth cannot be avoided, and this should be made clear if a nonbinary person seeks some of the other changes associated with estrogen therapy (such as softening of skin and reduction in facial hair growth) but does not want or is ambivalent about breast growth. For testosterone in nonbinary people assigned female at birth (AFAB), it should be recognized that if facial hair development is needed, genital growth is inevitable, and the time frame for taking testosterone means these changes are likely also to be accompanied by an irreversible vocal pitch drop, although the extent of each is individual; a vocal pitch drop without the development of body hair is another such challenge, and for some nonbinary people a low dose may be justified as a compromise. If hormonal therapy is discontinued and endogenous hormones are retained, many physical changes will revert to pre-hormone therapy status, including reversal of amenorrhea and body hair development in nonbinary people AFAB and reduction in muscular definition and erectile dysfunction in nonbinary people AMAB, but other changes will be permanent such as "male-pattern" baldness, genital growth, and facial hair growth in nonbinary people AFAB or breast development in nonbinary people AMAB; these will require further interventions to reverse, such as electrolysis or mastectomy and are sometimes described as "partially reversible". As the implications of using low-dose hormone therapy are not documented in this patient population, it is important to consider monitoring for cardiovascular risk and bone health if low-dose hormone therapy is used.

### Abnormal fetal growth: small for gestational age, fetal growth restriction, large for gestational age: definitions and epidemiology [^115CRdAi]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Abnormal fetal growth (growth restriction and overgrowth) is associated with perinatal morbidity, mortality, and lifelong risks to health. To describe abnormal growth, "small for gestational age" and "large for gestational age" are commonly used terms. However, both are statistical definitions of fetal size below or above a certain threshold related to a reference population, rather than referring to an abnormal condition. Fetuses can be constitutionally small or large and thus healthy, whereas fetuses with seemingly normal size can be growth restricted or overgrown. Although golden standards to detect abnormal growth are lacking, understanding of both pathologic conditions has improved significantly.

### How to catch a shear band and explain plasticity of metallic glasses with continuum mechanics [^115Mwbw8]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Fig. 3
Birth, arrest, and relaxation of SBs.

The distribution of von Mises strain within the N-A pattern after 7% global strain (a), after 8.8% global strain (b), and after full unload (c). The position of ROI is sketched in the inset of (a). The first and second generated SBs are marked by I and II, respectively. Enlarged views of the areas marked by black dashed rectangles in (a – c) are shown in (d – f), respectively. Black circles marked by A, B, and C depict characteristic points within the SB, at its tip and ahead of the tip, respectively. The line profiles of the major, minor, and von Mises strains between points A and C for the corresponding three loading states are given in (g – i), respectively. The straining direction is horizontal.

Shear band interaction and splitting

Another characteristic event that is highly valuable for understanding the interactions between shear bands is depicted in Fig. 4. Within an N-A pattern SB (marked by " SB1 ") was initiated during the second loading step and has reached the state depicted in Fig. 4a after the applied global strain of 6.5%. During the next loading step another SB (marked by " SB2 ") crossed it at approximately 90° as shown in Fig. 4b. After the last loading step, the SB1 split at the point of intersection with the SB2 leading to the appearance of the new branch (marked by " SB3 "), as depicted in Fig. 4c. The SEM images of the area around the intersection point of SB1 and SB2, corresponding to the dashed rectangles in Fig. 4 a– c, are shown in Fig. 4 d– f, respectively. The SB1 exhibits a distinct surface trace, additionally marked by the dashed red lines in Fig. 4d to guide the eye. The SB2, in contrast, is barely detectable on the SEM image without DIC analysis (Fig. 4e). The intersection point is marked by the red dashed circle in Fig. 4e. The disruption of the plane of SB1 at the intersection point is more evident in Fig. 4f, at the same time, the SB3 is also barely detectable with the used SEM imaging parameters. The video showing the evolution of all three independent components of the strain tensor is available as Supplementary video 3.

### Newborn skin: part II. birthmarks [^115WvevK]. American Family Physician (2008). Low credibility.

Birthmarks in newborns are common sources of parental concern. Although most treatment recommendations are based on expert opinion, limited evidence exists to guide management of these conditions. Large congenital melanocytic nevi require evaluation for removal, whereas smaller nevi may be observed for malignant changes. With few exceptions, benign birthmarks (e.g., dermal melanosis, hemangioma of infancy, port-wine stain, nevus simplex) do not require treatment; however, effective cosmetic laser treatments exist. Supernumerary nipples are common and benign; they are occasionally mistaken for congenital melanocytic nevi. High- and intermediate-risk skin markers of spinal dysraphism (e.g., dermal sinuses, tails, atypical dimples, multiple lesions of any type) require evaluation with magnetic resonance imaging or ultrasonography. Family physicians should be familiar with various birthmarks and comfortable discussing disease prevention and cosmetic strategies.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of infantile hemangiomas [^115Ay8aY]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Infantile hemangiomas (IHs) — early growth and referral timing: Most superficial IHs have accelerated growth between 5 and 7 weeks of age, and 4 weeks of age may be the ideal time for referral if high-risk features are present. After the first-week visit, an infant may not be seen again until 2 months of age, so prompt evaluation, either in-person or via photographs, is warranted for a changing birthmark during the first 2 months of life. In-person visits or a review of parental photos may be needed, especially in infants younger than 3 to 4 months. Because IHs are heterogeneous in size, location, distribution, and depth, if uncertainty exists, consultation with a hemangioma specialist (including photographic triage) can be helpful, and possible solutions could include establishing resources for photographic triage when risk stratification is uncertain or to hasten referral.

### Vitamin D status in children with congenital melanocytic nevi [^112LgtrK]. Pediatric Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Congenital melanocytic nevi (CMN) are rare, pigmented birthmarks that can predispose patients to melanoma of the central nervous system and skin. Data from non‐CMN melanoma cohorts suggest that vitamin D levels may be connected to outcome, prompting this study of 25‐hydroxyvitamin D levels in plasma samples from 40 children with CMN. While 27% were insufficient and 13% deficient, this was representative of European populations, and UK supplementation guidelines are already in place. Our data support routine vitamin D supplementation for all CMN patients during winter months, without routine serum measurement.

### Risk factors for the development of striae gravidarum [^115bBAxK]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2007). Low credibility.

Striae distensae or "stretch marks", referred to as striae gravidarum (SG) when they occur in pregnancy, are a common skin problem of considerable cosmetic concern to many patients. They are characterized clinically by linear bands that are initially erythematous to violaceous and gradually fade to become skin colored or hypopigmented atrophic lines that may be thin or wide. SG occur on the abdomen, breasts, buttocks, hips, and thighs and usually develop after the 24th week of gestation.

The cause of SG remains unknown but clearly relates to changes in the structures that provide the skin with its tensile strength and elasticity. Mechanical stretching of the skin in association with hormonal factors has been implicated in the pathogenesis. It has been postulated that some hormones, like estrogen, relaxin, and adrenocortical hormones, decrease the adhesiveness between collagen fibers and increase ground substance, which results in the formation of striae in areas of stretching. Striae may form due to structural connective tissue changes that include realignment and reduced elastin and fibrillin in the dermis. However, some studies have shown that although SG tend to occur in areas of maximum skin stretching, there is no correlation between the degree of striae formation and the extent of body size enlargement during pregnancy. A recent study has found a correlation between the presence of striae and pelvic relaxation, a condition associated with decreased collagen content. This study was limited in that it used self-reported data, and physical exams were not performed.

The data on prevalence of SG and the risk factors associated with their development are scant and often contradictory. It is estimated that up to 90% of pregnant women develop SG; however, some authors report the prevalence to be as low as 50%. Proposed risk factors for the development of SG include family history, race, skin type, birthweight (BW), baseline body mass index (BMI), age, weight gain, and poor nutrition; however, most of these have not been substantiated.

In preparation for a clinical trial on prevention of SG, we conducted a study to determine the incidence of SG in primiparous women in our population and identify the risk factors associated with their development. In addition to previously studied risk factors, we looked at other factors, not studied in the past, that may theoretically affect the risk of developing SG such has smoking history and fetal gender.
