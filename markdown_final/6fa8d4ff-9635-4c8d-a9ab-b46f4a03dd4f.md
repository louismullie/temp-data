## Question

What myositis ossification

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what myositis ossificans is, including its definition, typical presentations, diagnosis, imaging features, and treatment. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the definition and core pathophysiology. Then, I should classify the subtypes and typical clinical presentations. Next, I will review the imaging evolution and key differentials, especially sarcoma. After that, I need to outline management strategies, including when to operate. Finally, I will consider special populations and summarize practical takeaways with appropriate caveats and references.

> Let me first confirm the definition and pathophysiology. Myositis ossificans is a benign, self-limited heterotopic ossification of soft tissues, classically muscle, characterized by metaplastic bone formation after injury or, less commonly, spontaneously; it is not a neoplasm and often regresses or stabilizes over time, though it can be functionally limiting in some contexts [^113HVjhw] [^113YaLM9]. Wait, let me verify the mechanism: mesenchymal stem cells are dysregulated toward osteogenesis, frequently triggered by trauma, hematoma, and inflammatory cytokines including BMP signaling, which explains the zonal maturation pattern seen histologically and radiologically [^114hWKQi] [^112xJ2Lg].

> I need to check the classification next. The two main categories are nonhereditary (post-traumatic or circumscribed) and hereditary (progressive), with the latter being fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva, a distinct autosomal dominant disorder with ACVR1 mutation and characteristic congenital great toe anomalies; I should confirm that FOP is not simply "myositis ossificans" but a separate entity with different prognosis and management [^113HVjhw] [^115ntWpp] [^113q6ykt]. Hold on, I should verify the nomenclature: some authors describe subtypes such as traumatic, progressive, neurogenic, and burn-associated, but the unifying concept is heterotopic ossification with stage-dependent imaging and histology, which guides care decisions [^1112q1kj].

> Next, I should review the clinical presentation. Typical patients are young active adults with a clear antecedent contusion or strain, often in the thigh, buttock, or upper arm, presenting with pain, swelling, and restricted range of motion; a firm mass may be palpable and symptoms evolve over weeks to months as ossification matures [^113HVjhw] [^117R2oTW]. But wait, what if there is no recalled trauma? Up to a quarter of cases are nontraumatic, and pediatric or unusual locations such as the neck, hand, or masticatory muscles can delay diagnosis and increase the risk of mislabeling as tumor [^114hWKQi] [^113YaLM9] [^1156KSqP].

> I will now examine the imaging evolution, because staging is critical. Early on, plain films may be normal; ultrasound or MRI shows an ill-defined intramuscular mass with edema and enhancement, which can mimic sarcoma, so I should double-check that early MRI alone is not diagnostic and may be misleading [^1173dWWc] [^113SkfHh]. By about 6 weeks, a peripheral rim of mineralization appears and progresses centrally over time; CT best depicts the zonal phenomenon with peripheral dense ossification and central lucency, and radiographs eventually show a well-circumscribed ossified mass separated from the underlying bone, which helps distinguish it from parosteal osteosarcoma and other mimics [^1148MEES] [^112xJ2Lg] [^114S6JLv]. Hold on, I should verify that MRI can still show surrounding edema even in mature lesions, so correlation with radiographs or CT is essential to avoid overcalling malignancy [^113SkfHh].

> Let me consider the differential diagnosis carefully. The key malignant mimics are osteosarcoma and rhabdomyosarcoma; distinguishing features include the zonal pattern, peripheral maturation, and separation from bone in myositis ossificans, whereas osteosarcoma tends to be centrally ossified and contiguous with bone; clinical context and interval imaging are invaluable when the presentation is atypical or early [^112xJ2Lg] [^111jird6]. I should confirm that biopsy is reserved for indeterminate cases or when imaging and history are discordant, and that histology shows a zonal architecture with fibroblastic proliferation, osteoid, and mature bone at the periphery, which supports the diagnosis when correlated with imaging [^113HVjhw] [^114QVXs7].

> Now, management. Initially, I thought surgery might be first-line for persistent pain, but wait, let me reconsider: most cases resolve with conservative care, including rest, NSAIDs, physical therapy focused on gentle range of motion once acute pain subsides, and observation through the maturation phase; early excision risks recurrence because the osteogenic milieu persists [^113vHZV8] [^113Db4oy]. I should double-check the timing of surgery: excision is best deferred until the lesion is mature, typically at least 6 months after injury, to minimize recurrence; in athletes with function-limiting mature lesions, excision can return most to preinjury activity by 4–6 weeks post-op when combined with structured rehab [^113vHZV8] [^115UwmPG]. Hold on, I should verify adjuncts: bisphosphonates, radiation, and shockwave have been explored, but evidence is limited and case-based, so decisions should be individualized and multidisciplinary [^116WJPZj] [^113Db4oy].

> I need to ensure I address special populations and contexts. In children, nontraumatic cases occur and unusual sites like the neck or popliteal fossa can confound diagnosis; ultrasound is helpful for follow-up and detecting early calcification, and clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for atypical presentations [^1156KSqP] [^1143Q8Yr]. In the head and neck, masticatory muscle involvement can cause severe trismus; surgical excision is often required for function, but recurrence is not rare, so preoperative planning and counseling are important [^113F4LYX] [^112ztU5i]. But wait, what if there is concern for abuse? Infants with myositis ossificans of the neck may represent nonaccidental trauma, mandating careful social evaluation alongside imaging and biopsy when indicated [^114fjjLU].

> Let me summarize the practical approach. Suspect myositis ossificans in a young patient with a painful soft-tissue mass after contusion or strain, especially in the thigh; obtain radiographs and consider ultrasound early, add MRI for soft-tissue detail but correlate with CT to confirm the zonal ossification pattern; avoid premature biopsy or surgery; manage conservatively through maturation; and reserve excision for mature, symptomatic lesions after 6 months, with return-to-sport rehab guiding expectations [^113f8483] [^113vHZV8] [^115UwmPG]. Hold on, I should verify one last point: always keep sarcoma in the differential when the story is atypical or the imaging is discordant, and use interval imaging and, if necessary, tissue diagnosis to resolve uncertainty safely [^112xJ2Lg] [^113HVjhw].

Myositis ossificans is a **benign heterotopic ossification** of soft tissues, most often muscle, typically after trauma or overuse [^113HVjhw]. It presents as a painful, tender mass with restricted motion and is defined by a **zonal pattern** of peripheral mature bone and central immature tissue [^112xJ2Lg]. Imaging is key: early MRI shows edema and enhancement, while CT/radiographs later reveal peripheral calcification; biopsy is reserved for atypical cases to exclude sarcoma [^1148MEES] [^113HVjhw]. Management is **conservative** (rest, NSAIDs, physical therapy) [^113Db4oy]; surgery is only for mature, symptomatic lesions after 6–12 months to avoid recurrence [^113vHZV8] [^115UwmPG].

---

## Pathophysiology

The pathophysiology involves **trauma-induced mesenchymal stem cell differentiation** into osteoblasts via BMPs, especially BMP-4, forming heterotopic bone [^114hWKQi]. Early lesions are cellular and vascular; mature lesions show peripheral lamellar bone with central fibroblastic tissue — the **zonal pattern** [^1112q1kj].

---

## Clinical presentation

- **Demographics**: Young, active adults; rare in children [^116hx8VS] [^115rQDyf].
- **History**: Trauma or repetitive microtrauma; ~25% report no trauma [^114hWKQi].
- **Symptoms**: Painful, tender, firm mass; restricted joint motion; erythema, warmth, swelling [^116o2jKy].
- **Common sites**: Quadriceps, hamstrings, brachialis, gluteal muscles [^116hx8VS].

---

## Imaging features

| **Modality** | **Early stage (< 2 weeks)** | **Intermediate stage (2–6 weeks)** | **Mature stage (> 6 weeks)** |
|-|-|-|-|
| MRI | Ill-defined T2 hyperintensity; enhancement; edema | Peripheral low-signal rim; central high signal | Peripheral low-signal rim; central low signal |
| CT | No calcification | Peripheral calcification | Peripheral ossification; central lucency |
| Radiographs | No calcification | Faint peripheral calcification | Dense peripheral ossification; central lucency |

---

The **zonal pattern** — peripheral mature bone with central immature tissue — is characteristic and helps distinguish from sarcoma [^115Jckiu].

---

## Histopathology

Histopathology shows a **zonal architecture**: a central fibroblastic zone, an intermediate osteoid zone, and a peripheral mature bone zone; this pattern is diagnostic and helps exclude sarcoma [^114QVXs7].

---

## Differential diagnosis

- **Malignant tumors**: Osteosarcoma, chondrosarcoma, synovial sarcoma [^112xJ2Lg].
- **Benign lesions**: Nodular fasciitis, fibromatosis, lipoma [^116DJbAD].
- **Other**: Calcific myonecrosis, chronic hematoma, heterotopic ossification [^notfound].

---

## Management

### Conservative management

Conservative management includes **rest, ice, compression, elevation (RICE)**, NSAIDs, and physical therapy focused on gradual range-of-motion and strengthening [^113Db4oy]. Most cases resolve with these measures [^116hx8VS].

---

### Surgical management

Surgery is indicated for persistent pain, functional limitation, or neurovascular compromise after maturation. Excision should be delayed until the lesion is mature (** ≥ 6–12 months**) to reduce recurrence [^113vHZV8]. Postoperative rehabilitation is essential to restore function and prevent recurrence [^112qYLJo].

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis is **excellent** with conservative care; most recover fully. Recurrence is uncommon but higher with early surgery or incomplete excision [^115UwmPG].

---

## Complications

Complications include **recurrence** (especially with early or incomplete excision), persistent pain or stiffness, and neurovascular injury from mass effect or surgery [^113vHZV8].

---

## Prevention

Prevention focuses on **early injury management** with RICE and NSAIDs, avoiding premature aggressive therapy, and patient education on gradual return to activity [^111ZaQsb].

---

Myositis ossificans is a **self-limited heterotopic ossification** with a characteristic zonal pattern; accurate imaging and timely conservative care are central to management, with surgery reserved for mature, symptomatic lesions [^113HVjhw].

### Myositis ossificans [^113HVjhw]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2015). Low credibility.

Myositis ossificans is a self-limiting, benign ossifying lesion that can affect any type of soft tissue, including subcutaneous fat, tendons, and nerves. It is most commonly found in muscle as a solitary lesion. Ossifying soft-tissue lesions historically have been inconsistently classified. Fundamentally, myositis ossificans can be categorized into nonhereditary and hereditary types, with the latter being a distinct entity with a separate pathophysiology and treatment approach. The etiology of myositis ossificans is variable; however, clinical presentation generally is characterized by an ossifying soft-tissue mass. Advanced cross-sectional imaging alone can be nonspecific and may appear to be similar to more sinister etiologies. Therefore, the evaluation of a suspicious soft-tissue mass often necessitates multiple imaging modalities for accurate diagnosis. When imaging is indeterminate, biopsy may be required for a histologic diagnosis. However, histopathology varies based on stage of evolution. The treatment of myositis ossificans is complex and is often made in a multidisciplinary fashion because accurate diagnosis is fundamental to a successful outcome.

### Myositis ossificans of the trapezius muscle: a case report and literature review [^113YaLM9]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Myositis ossificans (MO) is a benign, self-limiting, and nonneoplastic lesion involving the skeletal muscle or soft tissue, rarely occurring in the head and neck. It is relatively rare in clinical practice, and it is difficult to distinguish specific cases from musculoskeletal conditions, which poses unique challenges for clinical diagnosis and treatment. We reported that a 9-year-old boy suffered from local and nontraumatic MO of the trapezius muscle. Given the rarity of this case, the present article detailed the diagnosis and treatment of this rare case and reviewed the relevant literature on MO, focusing on the clinical, pathological, and radiographic characteristics of MO. Notably, these investigations aimed to enhance clinicians' understanding of the disease and improve diagnostic accuracy.

Myositis ossificans is a type of bone-forming lesion that arises in soft tissue and mimics malignancy. We present a case of myositis ossificans in a 16-year-old girl with anxiety disorder, Asperger syndrome, and no known history of trauma. A variety of diagnostic tools including magnetic resonance, ultrasound, and biopsy are used to make the diagnosis. The histologic and radiographic findings used to distinguish this disorder from malignant conditions are discussed.

### Myositis ossificans: a rare neonatal presentation [^115rQDyf]. Pediatric Radiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Myositis ossificans is a benign, ossifying, soft-tissue pseudotumor that most commonly occurs in men ages 30–40 years after trauma. Myositis ossificans may also occur in children, but it is extremely rare in those younger than 10 years of age. While myositis ossificans can often mimic malignant soft-tissue tumors, it has many unique findings that can aid in diagnostic differentiation. This differentiation is critical to avoid unnecessary risk with potentially harmful procedures. We present a very unusual presentation of myositis ossificans in the immediate post-birth perinatal period, as well as a review of key imaging findings.

### Management of myositis ossificans of the hand: a case report and a review of the literature [^111G59Gt]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Myositis ossificans is a rare form of self-limiting heterotopic ossification of muscles. Most cases are seen in the thigh; the standard approach to these cases has been nonsurgical management awaiting spontaneous resolution. We report on a rare case of myositis ossificans of the hand with severe symptoms treated with early marginal excision without a trial of nonsurgical management.

### Nontraumatic myositis ossificans with an unusual location: case report [^115HxA6A]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

Myositis ossificans is a pathologic entity rarely met, but still it must be kept in mind in differential diagnosis of a tender soft tissue swelling. The authors present an 8-year old boy with nontraumatic myositis ossificans circumscripta in the left paravertebral muscle. In diagnostic workup, ultrasonography and computed tomography (CT)-scan showed a well marginated, regular, ossified mass in the paravertebral muscle, but we were not able to exclude malignancy on the clinical grounds. The mass was excised totally, and the histopathologic examination found myositis ossificans. The authors suggest that surgical intervention may be an option for diagnosis and treatment in unusual cases when diagnosis is not certain.

### Muscle contusion injury and myositis ossificans traumatica [^117R2oTW]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2002). Low credibility.

In athletic competition, muscle contusion injury is a frequent and debilitating condition. Found in traditional contact and noncontact sports, contusions also can occur to the nonathlete by simple falls and accidents. The injury consists of a well-defined sequence of events involving microscopic rupture and damage to muscle cells, macroscopic defects in muscle bellies, infiltrative bleeding, and inflammation. The repair of the tissue can be thought of as a race between remodeling and scar formation. In the current study, the authors describe the relevant body of research directed at delineating the incidence, factors that affect injury severity, and treatment of muscle contusion injury. Emphasis is given to animal models that allow reproducible, quantitative injury, and study of the effects of various treatment modalities. Myositis ossificans traumatica, one of the most debilitating consequences of contusion injuries, also is discussed. The incidence, causative factors, and prevention strategies are reviewed.

### Myositis ossificans circumscripta involving bilateral masticatory muscles [^112ztU5i]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Myositis ossificans (MO), as its name implies, is ossification and bone formation within a muscle. Pathogenesis is not all clear, but trauma is universally recognized as a trigger event. Myositis ossificans can be divided into 2 classifications: MO progressiva and MO traumatica. When it affects the muscles of mastication, it causes severe trismus. This rare disorder and its limited treatment options can potentially have debilitating effects to the patient's normal oral functioning and health. A computed tomographic scan and panoramic radiographs are essential diagnostic aids for evaluating conditions such as MO. Myositis ossificans can be one of the causes of extra-articular temporomandibular joint ankylosis. Surgical excision of the ossification is the main treatment modality. This is a case report of a patient who developed MO of the muscles of mastication.

### Myositis ossificans of the temporalis muscle: case report and review of the literature [^114hWKQi]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Myositis ossificans, also known as traumatic myositis ossificans or myositis ossificans circumscripta, is the product of an unusual reactive process of mesenchymal stem cells within the muscle produced secondary to a traumatic insult or inflammatory process. In approximately 75% of cases, the process has a direct correlation with a single or repetitive, traumatic, penetrating, or crushing injury to the muscle. However, in up to 25% of cases, there is no recollection of a traumatic event. The most commonly accepted mechanism of traumatic etiology includes the embedment and lysis of bone fragments within the soft tissue causing subsequent exposure of bone morphogenic proteins to extraosseous cells. This environment stimulates osteoblasts to form true bone, dystrophic calcifications, or a calcified chondroid matrix. A concomitant mechanism that occurs involves the overproduction of bone morphogenic protein-4 produced by the muscle cells or the muscle fascia.

### Bilateral and recurrent myositis ossificans in an athlete: a case report and review of treatment options [^116WJPZj]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2006). Low credibility.

An unusual case of recurrent myositis ossificans (MO) bilaterally in the hamstring muscles of a 47-year-old athlete secondary to trauma is presented with a review of the literature of current treatment options. MO is a common condition that occurs among athletes in association with muscle and/or tendon strain or contusion. After an extensive literature review, we believe this to be the first case reported of recurrent and bilateral MO in a nonsurgical setting from recurrent hamstring strains. Plain radiographs and physical examination revealed the appearance and chronology of this pathology. Treatment options to improve flexibility and decrease morbidity are discussed along with prophylaxis for future injury. Treatment of mobility and flexibility, rehabilitation goals and treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, bisphosphonates, and magnesium are discussed along with prophylaxis.

### A brachial plexopathy due to myositis ossificans. case report and review of the literature [^115FpCTK]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2001). Low credibility.

Myositis ossificans (MO) is a disorder characterized by the intramuscular proliferation of fibroblasts and osteoblasts, with subsequent deposition of bone and cartilage. A typical clinical presentation involves traumatic injury to a young adult, usually localized to the thigh, buttock, or upper arm, with resultant MO and mildly restricted range of motion in adjacent joints. Rarely, MO is associated with peripheral neuropathies involving the radial, median, sciatic, and sural nerves. The authors present an unusual case of MO causing a brachial plexopathy. To their knowledge, this is the first description of such a presentation.

### Myositis ossificans traumatica, an unusual cause of mandibular hypomobility [^113F4LYX]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Myositis ossificans traumatica is a rare condition in which causes restriction of mandibular movement. In this entity, temporomandibular joint is depleted of any problems; although all the patients have the history of trauma to the mandible and the face. Myositis ossificans traumatica can involve other parts of the body like femoral region with higher incidence in compare to the maxillofacial area. Blunt trauma to the head and neck causes muscle contusion injury, hematoma formation in the injured muscles or nearby soft tissues. Calcification of hematoma and heterotopic bone formation in the muscle, soft tissue, or near bony structures causes progressive decrease in mouth opening. Surgical removal of calcified body has been the only and one method for treatment of this disorder but rate of recurrence is high in the literature. The authors want to introduce 2 new cases of myositis ossificans traumatica, and then discuss about etiology and different treatment modalities.

### Surgical excision of symptomatic mature posttraumatic myositis ossificans: characteristics and outcomes in 32 athletes [^115UwmPG]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

The purpose of this study was to report characteristics and outcomes of surgical excision of symptomatic mature posttraumatic myositis ossificans in adult athletes. The hypothesis was that surgical excision of the ossified mass in these circumstances can effectively relief symptoms and result in return to high-level sports with minimal postoperative complications.

Methods

All operations involving excision of posttraumatic heterotopic ossifications performed between 1987 and 2015 were reviewed. Included cases had isolated excision of posttraumatic myositis ossificans, whereas excluded cases had: (1) concomitant reattachment of tendon to bone; (2) chronic overuse injuries which preceded the development of the heterotopic mass or large calcifications which were excised from tendon-to-bone insertions; and (3) excision of heterotopic ossification from a ligament, capsule, or tendon insertion following avulsion injury without tendon-to-bone repair. After surgery, return to sports was allowed at 4–6 weeks.

Results

Of 57 athletes undergoing excision of heterotopic ossifications, 32 were eligible as isolated excision of posttraumatic myositis ossificans. Twenty-four (75%) were ice hockey or soccer players. Median age was 23 years. Prior to surgery, patients were unable to continue their sports. At surgery, the ossification was excised from a thigh muscle in 27 (84%) cases. Median follow-up was 2 years (range 1–20 years). Outcome was Good/Excellent in 26 (81%) patients, corresponding to return to preinjury sports with minimal symptoms at sports activities. Preinjury Tegner activity level was resumed after surgery in 30 of 32 (94%) athletes, of whom 28 (94%) were involved in high-level sports corresponding to Tegner levels 8–10. No postoperative complications were recorded other than minimal insensitive areas at the periphery of skin incisions.

Conclusion

In high-level athletes who present chronic disabling mature posttraumatic myositis ossificans that interferes with their sports career, surgical excision of the heterotopic mass results in effective clinical improvement with return to sports and minimal postoperative risks.

### Vascular patterning in human heterotopic ossification [^1129xDVL]. Human Pathology (2017). Low credibility.

Heterotopic ossification (HO, also termed myositis ossificans) is the formation of extra-skeletal bone in muscle and soft tissues. HO is a tissue repair process gone awry, and is a common complication of surgery and traumatic injury. Medical strategies to prevent and treat HO fall well short of addressing the clinical need. Better characterization of the tissues supporting HO is critical to identifying therapies directed against this common and sometimes devastating condition. The physiologic processes of osteogenesis and angiogenesis are highly coupled and interdependent. However, few efforts have been made to document the vascular patterning within heterotopic ossification. Here, surgical pathology case files of 29 human HO specimens were examined by vascular histomorphometric analysis. Results demonstrate a temporospatial patterning of HO vascularity that depends on the "maturity" of the bony lesion. In sum, human HO demonstrates a time- and space-dependent pattern of vascularization suggesting a coupled pathophysiologic process involving the coordinate processes of osteogenesis and angiogenesis. Further imaging studies may be used to further characterize vasculogenesis within HO and whether anti-angiogenic therapies are a conceivable future therapy for this common condition.

### Pediatric nontraumatic myositis ossificans of the neck [^1156KSqP]. Pediatric Radiology (2009). Low credibility.

Nontraumatic myositis ossificans circumscripta (MOC) is a rarely reported benign heterotopic ossification characterized by the aberrant formation of bone in extraskeletal soft tissues. Although a history of trauma can be elicited in 75% of MOC patients, the etiology is unclear in patients without inciting injury. MOC is associated with young male athletes, and is most often localized to the muscle groups of the extremities. Rare cases have been reported in children and adolescents of nontraumatic MOC in the neck. We present a 15-year-old adolescent with a rapidly growing, painful neck mass without traumatic stimulus.

### An unusual presentation of myositis ossificans in a pediatric patient [^116o2jKy]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Myositis ossificans (MO) is a rare, non-neoplastic lesion characterized by heterotopic ossification of soft tissue. The condition is predominantly seen in young adults and adolescents and is most commonly secondary to trauma. Although the exact etiology remains unclear, patients typically present with pain and restricted range of motion following trauma or overuse. MO rarely presents in the popliteal fossa of adult patients and has not been previously reported in that of a pediatric patient.

Methods

We present a 12-year-old patient with no history of direct trauma with MO in the right popliteal fossa, a highly unusual location. Initial x-rays failed to show the lesion; however, later radiographs showed an ossified mass. At peak dimensions, the ossification measured 3.8 cm anteroposterior×2.5 cm transverse×3.2 cm craniocaudal. After 14 months of observation and conservative therapy, the mass was excised.

Results

The patient was ultimately able to return to full activity. Radiographs taken 14 months after the excision showed no signs of recurrence of the lesion.

Conclusions

To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of MO excised from the popliteal fossa of a pediatric patient and followed for > 1 year.

### Cutaneous myositis ossificans: an appropriate descriptor for fibro-osseous lesion of the external auditory canal [^115eBETG]. The American Journal of Dermatopathology (2009). Low credibility.

Myositis ossificans is a benign pseudosarcomatous bone-forming lesion, histologically characterized by 2 components: a spindle (myo)fibroblastic cell population and a bony component that is arranged in a "zonal" pattern. It mainly affects the deep soft tissues of limbs, but its occurrence in other unusual locations, such as abdomen, inside nerves, and the subcutaneous fat, has been reported. The existence of myositis ossificans restricted to the skin has rarely been published under the term "fibro-osseous lesion of the external auditory canal". Here, we describe an additional case in the external auditory canal, emphasizing its differential diagnosis and alerting dermatopathologists and pathologists to the possibility of encountering such lesion in this anatomic location. For purposes of unifying terms, we propose that cases similar to ours be called "cutaneous myositis ossificans" instead of fibro-osseous lesion of the external auditory canal.

### Rare case of a traumatic myositis ossificans in the tibialis anterior muscle [^113Db4oy]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

Athletes involved in contact sports can be diagnosed with traumatic myositis ossificans. Myositis ossificans is characterised by a benign ossifying lesion in soft tissue mass, most commonly preceded by a muscle contusion in the thigh. Despite the fact that it is often a self-limiting disease, treatment modalities are anti-inflammatory drugs, physiotherapy, shockwave therapy, radiation therapy or surgical resection. We report a 22-year-old competitive football player with severe ongoing pain in the lower leg after a direct trauma. An X-ray showed calcification between the tibia and fibula. An additional ultrasound confirmed the diagnosis: myositis ossificans of the tibialis anterior muscle. After treating him with anti-inflammatory drugs and physiotherapy, he was able to return to sports. Myositis ossificans of the lower leg is an uncommon, though if present, troublesome condition, occurring after a contusion.

### An unusual case of bilateral myositis ossificans in a young athlete [^115H4FQU]. BMJ Case Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

This case report describes the occurrence of bilateral myositis ossificans in the rectus femoris muscles of a young Gaelic football player with a long history of recurrent bilateral thigh strain. In each case, clinical diagnosis was followed up with biochemical profiling and sonographic investigations. Management consisted of rest from elite level competition and intense rehabilitation to address any potential risk factors for rectus femoris strain. A 4-week course of acetic acid iontophoresis was administered to the first myositis ossificans lesion on the left thigh; however, as this did not result in any significant changes to the lesion's dimensions, it was not used on the contralateral lesion. The athlete returned to full sporting capacity 4 months after the first lesion was diagnosed. A 13-month follow-up showed that the athlete continued to play to full capacity with no recurrence of injury.

### Myositis ossificans: the mimicker [^116wh8hH]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

A 14-year-old boy presented with upper backache and a painful swelling in the right paraspinal region for 7 days. He had no history of trauma. MRI showed a non-specific ill-defined heterogeneous lesion, which showed intense postcontrast enhancement. Ultrasonogram showed a peripheral sheet of calcification around the lesion. A CT scan showed a faint rim of calcification, which increased in thickness over weeks, confirming the diagnosis as myositis ossificans. We present our approach to the case and also review the imaging features of different stages of the disease process and their differentials.

### Myositis ossificans of the medial pterygoid muscle [^112mhrHD]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Myositis ossificans (MO) is a disease whose main feature is the formation of heterotopic bone involving muscle or any other soft tissue. Pathogenesis is not all clear, but trauma is universally recognized as a trigger event. Myositis ossificans can be divided into 2 classifications: MO progressiva and MO traumatica. The authors present a case of a 64-year-old man who was diagnosed with MOT of the left medial pterygoid muscle. The patient had a long clinical history of signs and symptoms of temporomandibular articulation related to previous conditions, and no major traumatic events were reported, apparently related to MOT.

A young soccer player was diagnosed with myositis ossificans 6 weeks after a muscle strain in the right thigh. Radiographic and sonographic investigations initially helped to confirm diagnosis and later supported clinical improvement. We present our approach to the case and discuss pathophysiology, prevention and treatment of this rare condition.

Muscles are among the soft tissues one of the best adapted to ultrasound examination. In fact, it was the first imaging available for the evaluation of muscle disease. The availability, low cost, and ease of examination makes ultrasound superior to MRI for follow-up of lesions and searching for healing problems such as as fibrosis, cystic haematomas, or myositis ossificans. When dealing with fresh traumatic muscle lesions, the main goal of ultrasound is to assess the presence of a muscle tear or not. Haematoma is the key sign of a muscle tear. The ideal time for the examination is between 2 and 48 h after the muscle trauma. Before 2 h, the haematoma is still in formation. After 48 h, the haematoma can be spread outside of the muscle. After healing, ultrasound can depict some complications such as a cystic lesion or myositis ossificans. Muscle atrophy, inflammation, avulsion and tumours are also good indications for ultrasound.

### Circumscribed myositis ossificans of the masseter muscle [^113RFyMz]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Abstract

The authors report a case of myositis ossificans traumatica of the masseter muscles. A 21-year-old man developed masseter myositis after orthognathic surgery to treat facial asymmetry. The myositis may have been triggered by factors such as calcification of a hematoma, periosteum implantation after surgical trauma, and local soft tissue injury. An intraoral incision was made to excise the ectopic bone, resulting in resolution of the patient's symptoms including limited oral opening.

### Paratesticular myositis ossificans of the spermatic cord [^115YmYEW]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

A 56-year-old man presented with a painless scrotal lump, enlarging over the preceding 1month. The lump was roughly 1cm in size, and located in his left hemiscrotum and separate from the testis. An ultrasound revealed an echogenic focus with dystrophic tissue calcification. Subsequent surgical excision and histopathological analysis revealed it to be late-stage myositis ossificans, a benign, extraosseous formation of the bone or cartilage. We report of only the second described case of myositis ossificans of the spermatic cord in the literature to date.

### Fasciitis ossificans: imaging features, histology, and differential diagnosis [^114QVXs7]. Clinical Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Aim

To describe the imaging features of fasciitis ossificans and its histopathological features.

Materials and Methods

Using a word search of existing pathology reports at the Mayo Clinic, six cases of fasciitis ossificans were identified. The clinical history, histology, and available imaging of the affected area were reviewed.

Results

Imaging consisted of radiographs, mammograms, ultrasound images, bone scintigraphs, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images. All cases demonstrated a soft-tissue mass. The characteristic MRI appearance was a T2 hyperintense enhancing mass with surrounding soft-tissue oedema. Peripheral calcifications were seen on radiographs, CT, and/or ultrasound. Histological sections showed distinct zonation, with nodular fasciitis-like zones of myofibroblastic proliferation, which merged with osteoblasts that rim the ill-defined trabeculae of woven bone and became continuous with the mature lamellar bone surrounded by a thin layer of compressed fibrous tissue.

Conclusion

Imaging features of fasciitis ossificans are that of an enhancing soft-tissue mass located within a fascial plane with prominent surrounding oedema and mature peripheral calcification. Imaging and histology are that of myositis ossificans but occurring within the fascia. It is important that radiologists are aware of the diagnosis of fasciitis ossificans and appreciate its similarity to myositis ossificans. This is particularly important in anatomical locations with fascias but no muscle. Given the radiographic and histological overlap between these entities, nomenclature that encompasses both could be considered in the future.

We present a 10-week-old girl with myositis ossificans circumscripta (MO) of the neck secondary to nonaccidental trauma. This condition is rarely seen in infants; furthermore, the majority of MO lesions develop in the extremities rather than the head and neck region. We will detail the US-guided biopsy technique used in our case, in addition to discussing the characteristic imaging and pathological findings of MO to assist in the diagnosis and successful treatment of this condition.

### Radiological identification and analysis of soft tissue musculoskeletal calcifications [^113SkfHh]. Insights Into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

First step: Is it really a calcification?

The first step is to differentiate calcifications from ossifications or foreign bodies. One can achieve this goal by analysing its density, shape and pattern.

Density

Calcifications normally appear as mineralised densities with an attenuation coefficient higher than soft tissue but lower than bone (Fig. 2). With computed tomography (CT), there is a wide range of Hounsfield unit (HU) values for calcifications, but it is mostly between 100 and 400 HU, whereas bone reaches higher values (700 HU for trabecular bone and over 1500 HU for cortical bone; Fig. 3). Foreign body density varies depending on the nature of the material, but glass and silicone, among others, may have similar HU values to calcifications (Fig. 4).

(b) Anteroposterior radiograph of the right shoulder in a different patient shows migration of the calcifications to the subdeltoid-subacromial bursa (arrows) during the resorptive phase

Ossification. Axial CT image of myositis ossificans in the infraspinatus muscle shows a cortical and trabecular mineralisation pattern with a zonal distribution (absence of mineralisation centrally due to fatty bone marrow)

Fig. 4
Foreign bodies. Lateral radiograph of the foot shows glass fragments (arrowhead) in the plantar soft tissues, with sharp edges and a rectangular shape

CT is more sensitive than radiography for the detection and analysis of calcifications and provides additional information regarding adjacent tissues such as neurovascular bundles, muscles, tendons and inflammatory reactions. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) shows various signal intensities on conventional spin echo T1- or T2-weighted images and can frequently overlook calcifications, hence the importance to correlate MRI with conventional radiographs on every occasion. Misleading appearances can occur such as fluid signal (mimicking tear) or intense inflammatory reaction surrounding a calcification. Gradient echo sequences and, more recently, a three-dimensional fast low-angle gradient-recalled echo (GRE) sequence (susceptibility-weighted imaging [SWI]) can depict calcifications more accurately. Based on phase images, the latter allows a better distinction between calcifications and other causes of susceptibility variations. Ultrasound is known to be more sensitive than radiography, however, when acoustic shadowing is present, it will prevent one from doing a complete assessment and being able to differentiate between ossification and calcification.

### Surgical excision of post-traumatic myositis ossificans of the adductor longus in a football player [^116hx8VS]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

Background

Myositis ossificans (MO) is a non-neoplastic heterotopic ossification that develops within skeletal muscle or soft tissue. The exact pathophysiological pathway of this rare disease is still not fully understood. It is believed that, in response to tissue injury and subsequent inflammation, stem cells are dysregulated and stimulated to follow osteogenic pathways, resulting in ossification. The disorder can be differentiated into four subtypes: (1) MO traumatica; (2) MO progressiva (hereditary form); (3) MO associated with paraplegia and (4) MO associated with burns. Myositis ossificans traumatica (MOT) is the most common type and accounts for 60%–75% of all cases.MOT usually occurs in the girdles and limbs of active young men after major or repeated minor trauma. The brachialis, quadriceps and adductor group muscles are more prone to MOT according to the literature.

MOT can be mistaken for malignant lesions such as osteosarcoma or rhabdomyosarcoma. Therefore, appropriate diagnostic tests are of paramount importance. However, the stage of the disease affects its presentation and might lead to difficulties in the interpretation of radiological and histological findings.

As MOT is self-limiting and self-resolving in most cases, conservative treatment with rest, adequate pain relief, and restoring function and range of motion is often effective for returning to sports and activities. Other non-surgical options include aspirating hematomas, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and extracorporeal shockwave therapy (ESWT). Surgical intervention should be considered when the consolidated mass persists and causes symptoms.

We present the first reported case of MOT of the adductor longus muscle in a football player, which was treated successfully with surgical excision.

Post-traumatic myositis ossificans is a benign condition of heterotopic ossification of unknown aetiology which typically is related to trauma from a single blow or repeated episodes of microtrauma. A case of myositis ossificans that developed after hamstring autograft harvest for an open cruciate ligament and posterolateral corner reconstruction is described, a previously unrecognised complication of this procedure.

### Myositis ossificans traumatica of the masticatory muscles [^112x4gRu]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Myositis ossificans traumatica (MOT) is a disease in which muscular ossification develops following trauma. Almost all cases of MOT are found in skeletal muscle. The authors report in a 39-year-old man MOT involving several muscles in the head and neck, namely, bilateral masseter muscles, the left temporal muscle, the left lateral pterygoid muscle, and the left frontal muscle. Involvement of the lateral pterygoid muscle is especially rare.

### Pre-and post-therapy MR imaging in fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva [^113HfesV]. Pediatric Radiology (2006). Low credibility.

Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva, also known as myositis ossificans progressiva, is characterized by congenital skeletal malformations and progressive ectopic bone formation in connective tissues. The disorder presents as rapidly growing masses usually in the neck or paraspinal region with stiffness in the adjoining joints. The preosseous lesions involve the fascia, ligaments, tendons, and skeletal muscle. These lesions occasionally resolve but more often progress to form ectopic ossification. We present a boy who had a characteristic clinical presentation. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging conducted in the preosseous stage of the lesion revealed the pathology, resulting in early therapy and resolution of the preosseous lesion without progression to ossification. To the best of our knowledge, post-therapy follow-up MR imaging in such a case has not been reported.

### Understanding a mass in the paraspinal region: an anatomical approach [^112xXLAs]. Insights Into Imaging (2023). Medium credibility.

Calcifications and ossifications

Myositis ossificans (MOC) is non-neoplastic abnormal extraosseous bone formation. MOC occurs usually in young adults and can be either traumatic, which is the most common, or non-traumatic in origin. They are extremely rare in the paraspinal muscles, in the largest reported case series, only one of the 68 patients was found in the paraspinal muscles. The radiological appearance of MOC evolves as the lesion matures. At an early stage, MRI shows an ill-defined muscle mass with a central high signal intensity and no adjacent bone abnormalities. After a few weeks, a peripheral rim of mineralisation appears around the lesion, with a periosteal reaction also present in the adjacent bone.

Spinal crystal deposition may cause paraspinal pseudomasses, particularly in the setting of an acute inflammatory presentation. Paraspinal abnormalities are usually adjacent to erosive facet joints, or less frequently to erosive vertebral plates. Tophi or calcium pyrophosphate deposition appears hypo- or isointense compared with muscles on both T1WI and T2WI with peripheral enhancement. Crystal deposition can be seen on CT images in the form of a dense mass.

Infection

Spinal infections, discitis–osteomyelitis (DOM) and septic facet joints may affect the paraspinal region in many ways: reactive inflammation, pyomyositis and abscesses can occur in the epaxial muscles around the affected joint (Fig. 11). DOM is often associated with paraspinal soft tissue abnormalities, especially in hypaxial muscles, close to the anterior endplates, where DOM originates from. In the early stages of DOM, high T2 signal intensity in the psoas musculature, known as the 'imaging psoas sign', is suggestive of DOM. Paraspinal abscesses occur as a late presentation of spinal infection. Well-defined paraspinal abnormal enhancement and thin and smooth rim enhancement of paraspinal abscesses and calcifications within abscesses are suggestive of tuberculous DOM. In cases of tuberculosis, large paraspinal abscesses, termed 'cold abscesses', can develop without severe pain or prominent inflammatory signs and symptoms.

### Myositis ossificans-another condition with USP6 rearrangement, providing evidence of a relationship with nodular fasciitis and aneurysmal bone cyst [^116DJbAD]. Annals of Diagnostic Pathology (2018). Low credibility.

Myositis ossificans is defined as a self-limiting pseudotumor composed of reactive hypercellular fibrous tissue and bone. USP6 rearrangements have been identified as a consistent genetic driving event in aneurysmal bone cyst and nodular fasciitis. It is therefore an integral part of the diagnostic workup when dealing with (myo)fibroblastic lesions of soft tissue and bone. Two cases of myositis ossificans with USP6 rearrangement were published so far. We determine herein the incidence of USP6 rearrangement in myositis ossificans using USP6 fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis (FISH). Of the 11 cases included, seven patients were female and four were male. Age ranged from 6 to 56 years (mean 27 years). Lesions were located in the thigh (n = 5), knee (n = 1), lower leg (n = 1), lower arm (n = 1), perineum (n = 1), gluteal (n = 1) and thoracic wall (n = 1). All assessable cases except one (8/9) showed rearrangement of USP6 providing evidence that myositis ossificans is genetically related to nodular fasciitis and aneurysmal bone cyst.

### Myositis and its mimics: guideline updates, MRI characteristics, and new horizons [^113Jjbzj]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2024). Medium credibility.

Myositis is defined as inflammation within skeletal muscle and is a subcategory of myopathy, which is more broadly defined as any disorder affecting skeletal muscle. Myositis may be encountered as a component of autoimmune and connective tissue diseases, where it is described as idiopathic inflammatory myopathy (IIM). Myositis can also be caused by infections as well as toxins and drugs, including newer classes of medications. MRI plays an important role in the diagnosis and evaluation of patients with suspected myositis, but many entities may have imaging features similar to those of myositis and can be considered myositis mimics. These include muscular dystrophies, denervation, deep venous thrombosis, diabetic myonecrosis, muscle injury, heterotopic ossification, and even neoplasms. In patients with suspected myositis, definitive diagnosis may require integrated analysis of imaging findings with clinical, laboratory, and pathology data. The objectives of this article are to review the fundamental features of myositis, including recent updates in terminology and consensus guidelines for IIMs; the most important MRI differential diagnostic considerations for myositis (i.e., myositis mimics); and new horizons, including the potential importance of artificial intelligence and multimodal integrated diagnostics in the evaluation of patients with muscle disorders.

### Myositis ossificans circumscripta of the sacrotuberous ligament: a case report and review of the literature [^117RRyje]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2002). Low credibility.

Soft tissue ossification is a well-known phenomenon in various pathologic conditions. Myositis ossificans circumscripta refers to posttraumatic calcification of soft tissue, including various ligaments. However, posttraumatic calcification of ligaments in the pelvis is a rare complication described only anecdotally in the past. We present a rare case of posttraumatic calcification of the sacrotuberous ligament in a patient, several months after suffering a pelvic trauma. This is one of the differential diagnoses of soft tissue pain and tenderness after trauma.

### Myositis ossificans traumatica of the medial pterygoid muscle after third molar Tooth extraction: a case report and review of literature [^114fY4mm]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Myositis ossificans (MO) is a rare non-neoplastic disorder characterized by heterotopic ossification in soft tissues, mainly muscles. MO traumatica is characterized by ossification of the soft tissues after acute or repetitive trauma, burns, or surgical intervention. Muscular or soft tissue trauma is usually present as the underlying etiology. MO traumatica usually involves the extremity muscles. The number of reported cases involving the masticatory muscles is extremely low. The most common clinical sign of this condition is progressive limitation of mouth opening. Surgical resection of the ossified tissue has been the most commonly used treatment for this disorder, with a high postoperative recurrence rate. We report a case of traumatic MO of the medial pterygoid muscle to draw attention to the possibility of the condition in patients with a limited mouth opening and to review the reported data about MO traumatica involving the medial pterygoid muscle.

### Heterotopic ossification of the quadratus lumborum muscle [^113foSWK]. Journal of Radiology Case Reports (2014). Low credibility.

Heterotopic ossification is a benign process of mature laminar bone formation in the soft tissues. A synonymous term used to describe this pathology in muscle is myositis ossificans. The pathogenesis is unclear, but is likely multifactorial. The basic pathology is thought to be ectopic production of osseous tissue as part of a repair process in response to tissue injury. This report describes a case of heterotopic ossification of the quadratus lumborum muscle as an incidental finding. This case highlights that treatment is based on symptoms and conservative management might be appropriate for the asymptomatic patient.

### An unusual case of severe trismus after craniotomy [^116ZUywg]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Myositis ossificans Traumatica (MOT) is a non-neoplastic, heterotrophic ossifying disease process in muscle and soft tissue rarely involving the craniofacial area. Treatment depends on the extent of ossification and functional limitations. We present the first case of MOT of the temporalis muscle following neurosurgical intervention. This is the case of a 28-year-old male patient who underwent numerous neurosurgical interventions and reported progressive trismus following these interventions. Imaging demonstrated a right temporal region radio-opacity consistent with ossification of the temporalis muscle. The patient underwent coronoidectomy with excision of the ossified right temporalis muscle and reconstruction with an anterolateral thigh adipofascial vascular free flap. Postoperatively, he maintained intact function with increased incisal opening and no cosmetic defects. Limited mouth opening after the neurological procedure has a wide differential, and MOT must be considered. Surgical repair and reconstruction are multifaceted problems. Free flap reconstruction should be considered in multiple operated patients.

We report a case of a 29-year-old man who had been a victim of a public road accident. Four weeks later, the patient developed an isolated right thigh mass located ventrally in the distal one-third of the thigh. The mass was painful and associated with fever and inflammatory syndrome. Plain radiographs showed a bilateral calcified thickening of soft tissues with well-defined bony margins. Ultrasound objectified diffuse calcifications of soft tissues.CT scan-confirmed the diagnosis of myositis ossificans circumscripta, showing a bilateral thickening of the vastus intermedius chief of the quadriceps dotted with calcifications, extending along the femur axis. These calcifications have well-defined bony margins separated from the periosteum by a lucent zone.

### Radiological identification and analysis of soft tissue musculoskeletal calcifications [^115Jckiu]. Insights Into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Differential diagnosis of intramuscular and subcutaneous calcifications

HO is another non-neoplastic lesion that shows calcifications in the early stages, before the typical bone organisation pattern is recognised (Fig. 3). When occurring in a muscle, it is called myositis ossificans circumscripta, but it can be found in virtually any soft tissue, after trauma. Myositis ossificans can have an aggressive and worrisome clinical presentation and histopathology, suggesting a sarcoma. Follow up study with radiograph or CT is recommended and will show faint calcifications that will eventually evolve towards a focal ossification with a classical zonal distribution (Fig. 3). Burns are a classic cause of heterotopic ossification. Chronic venous insufficiency in the lower extremities will often have heterotopic ossification with a honeycomb appearance that coalesces in the subcutaneous tissues. There are two hereditary forms called progressive osseous heteroplasia and fibrodysplasia ossificans progressive. The latter causes severe ossifications that will eventually prevent adequate motion, causing respiratory failure and death at an early age.

### Surgical excision of post-traumatic myositis ossificans of the adductor longus in a football player [^113vHZV8]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

Surgical excision of MOT can be considered when pain persists, if muscle weakness is present, or in case of a limited range of motion. It is crucial that surgical excision of MOT is planned to take place at least 6 months after the initial trauma, when the ossification is fully matured. Excision of immature ossifications often leads to local recurrence. Our patient met all the above-mentioned conditions for surgical excision: increased pain, functional impairment and failure to resume sport activities for over 1 year.

Imaging can be useful to diagnose MOT correctly. Especially when considering that malignant diseases such as osteosarcoma and rhabdomyosarcoma can have similar clinical presentations. Still, the different imaging modalities have to be interpreted with caution, since radiological findings depend on the stage of the disease. In combination with a thorough patient history and physical examination, MOT can be distinguished adequately from other diseases. Both Devilbiss et al and Li et al provide a clear overview of specific characteristics of MO which could be helpful to differentiate between diagnoses.

Guideline recommendations on return to sports for athletes with MO treated conservatively are lacking, let alone for athletes after surgical excision. Orava et al allowed athletes to return to sports 4–6 weeks after surgical excision of MOT. For athletes with persisting symptoms and those who did not fulfil the return to sport criteria, this period was extended for up to another month. In their series, 30 of the 32 athletes were able to resume preinjury Tegner activity levels. In our case, we decided to refer the patient to the well-known physiotherapists of the local football club for postoperative rehabilitation, closely following up the patient with outpatient visits at 4 weeks, 3 months, 5 months and 7 months. Seven months postoperatively, the patient had returned to preinjury activity levels and resumed football matches.

Review of referrals to our unit over the last 7 years showed that of approximately 750 cases referred as soft-tissue tumours, 132 were subsequently diagnosed as non-neoplastic lesions. The imaging characteristics of these lesions are presented to differentiate them from neoplasms. The most common diagnoses were myositis ossificans, ganglion cyst, abscess/infection, bursitis and synovitis. The imaging features of other rarer conditions will also be discussed.

### Recalcitrant ulnar-sided hand pain in a collegiate golfer: a case report [^1141LXqp]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

This case report details a diagnosis of myositis ossificans in a collegiate golfer with right ulnar-sided hand pain after striking the ground on a swing. Despite conservative treatment and a thorough workup, the patient's ulnar-sided hand pain did not improve. An ultrasound eventually revealed myositis ossificans within the abductor digiti minimi muscle. The patient received an ultrasound-guided fenestration and injection of lidocaine and dexamethasone into the affected muscle, leading to complete symptom resolution. Myositis ossificans is often secondary to trauma, causing bone formation in soft tissue, leading to pain, limited range of motion, and disability. This case highlights the importance of considering myositis ossificans in cases of persistent muscular pain and the diagnostic challenges related to ulnar-sided hand anatomy.

### Diagnostic features of fibrodysplasia (myositis) ossificans progressiva on bone scan [^113q6ykt]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP) is a rare, autosomal dominant disorder of connective tissue that leads to progressive, disabling heterotopic ossification in characteristic anatomic patterns. It is accompanied by pathognomonic congenital malformation of the great toes (or thumbs) - microdactyly. There is a high occurrence of diagnostic errors in FOP, leading to inappropriate interventions that may result in significant harm to patients. Scintigraphic demonstration of heterotopic ossifications in connective tissue at characteristic locations, in combination with pathognomonic microdactyly of the great toes (or thumbs), is highly specific. The case presented here is aimed at increasing familiarity with those typical diagnostic features, especially on bone scintigraphy.

### Surgical excision of post-traumatic myositis ossificans of the adductor longus in a football player [^111eSgEP]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of MOT of the adductor longus muscle described in the literature. This case emphasises that surgical excision of MOT of the adductor longus muscle can be an effective option when conservative treatment options have failed.

Patient's perspective

After the last follow-up moment, we asked the patient to describe the clinical process, including the surgical treatment on his perspective. He described this as follows: at first, I was a bit shocked when I was told that MOT of the adductor longus muscle is a rare disease and that it was never seen by the sports doctor. At the same time, I trusted the sports doctor, thanks to his open and professional approach. I was informed about the potential risk in losing some of the muscle strength of my right leg when choosing to undergo surgery. However, surgery was the obvious choice for me because the MOT affected my activities of daily living. After surgery, the pain was slightly worse than before but this reduced quickly and I could resume my activities of daily living. Furthermore, due to the close follow-up and the rehabilitation programme, I experience no (pain) complaints anymore during football and I am able to fully participate in football matches. I am very satisfied with the treatment and the end result.

Learning points

Myositis ossificans traumatica (MOT) of the adductor muscles is extremely rare.
Immediate treatment of a skeletal muscle injury with the rest, ice, compression and elevation principle might help in the prevention of MOT.
Surgical excision of MOT of the adductor longus muscle is a good option when conservative treatments fail.

Differential diagnosis

The differential diagnosis of MOT includes benign and malignant diseases. Benign diseases that may be confused with MOT are local abscess formation, a calcified fibrous tumour and periosteal reaction, whereas osteosarcoma and rhabdomyosarcoma are important malignant diseases to consider. In the present case, it was possible to distinguish MOT from all these other diagnoses through the combination of the specific history of a sports trauma, the physical examination, combined with both ultrasound and X-ray imaging.

### Use of imaging prior to referral to a musculoskeletal oncologist [^113f8483]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2019). High credibility.

Plain radiographs — soft tissue tumor of unknown etiology: In the absence of reliable evidence, it is the opinion of the work group that conventional radiographs are a reasonable diagnostic test and may be considered during the initial evaluation of a soft tissue tumor (Strength of Recommendation: Consensus). With respect to soft tissue tumors there is scant published literature regarding the value of conventional radiographs for diagnosis or planning; certain radiographic findings can be very helpful when present — such as phleboliths in hemangiomas, characteristic ossification patterns of myositis ossificans, mineralization within the substance of the tumor, density of the tumor, and cortical involvement of the underlying bone — however, many times conventional radiographs will not add any additional information regarding the identity of the tumor. Thus, our work group agreed that this test should be regarded as a justifiable, although not universally critical, diagnostic study at initial evaluation of soft tissue tumors.

### Traumatic myositis ossificans as a result of college fraternity hazing [^1125c2V5]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2008). Low credibility.

We present a case of a 20-year-old college student who had myositis ossificans traumatica develop after a fraternity hazing. The patient was struck repeatedly on both of his thighs while standing at attention, and he presented with bilateral thigh pain and stiffness 6 weeks after the incident. Physical examination revealed 130 degrees flexion of his right knee and 50 degrees flexion of his left knee, which had a firm end point. Radiographs showed extensive new bone located adjacent to the anterior and lateral aspects of his left femur with less involvement of his right thigh. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed considerable edema involving much of the rectus femoris and vastus lateralis of both thighs. The patient was treated with physical therapy and indomethacin for pain and inflammation control. At his 1.5-year followup, the patient's left knee flexion had improved to 130 degrees. Nonoperative treatment with careful followup resulted in a favorable outcome in this patient despite considerable formation of bilateral thigh myositis ossificans traumatica.

Investigations

Ultrasound imaging showed an old rupture of the right adductor longus muscle with a small fluid collection located proximally. Distally, a calcification of 8 cm was seen, indicating a chronic disease process with signs of active inflammation.

Myositis ossificans It is a tumor mimicker resulting from heterotopic bone formation, typically following trauma. It can occur at any age. Unlike BPOP, ossification progresses from periphery to center. Thus, the major distinguishing feature of myositis ossificans is the "zonal phenomenon", which represents peripheral mineralization with central lucency (Fig. 11). Additionally, myositis ossificans is usually separated from the adjacent bone but, as the lesion matures, a stalk of attachment to the underlying bone can be seen.

### Heterotopic ossification of peripheral nerve ("neuritis ossificans"): report of two cases [^113ryLxZ]. Neurosurgery (2002). Low credibility.

Objective and Importance

Heterotopic ossification ("neuritis ossificans") is among the least frequently encountered reactive lesions in peripheral nerves. Only two cases have been described previously, one in the median nerve of a 34-year-old man, and the other in the ulnar nerve of an adult woman. The architecture of this lesion is distinctly zonal. Consisting of a central fibroblastic core, an intervening zone of osteoid production, and a peripheral layer of ossification, the pattern is remarkably similar to that of myositis ossificans. This similarity and the occurrence of the process in superficial nerves have led to speculation that trauma plays a role in its pathogenesis; this hypothesis remains unproved. We describe two additional cases of neuritis ossificans.

Clinical Presentation

One patient, a 41-year-old man, experienced pain and numbness in the left leg for several months but had no history of local trauma. A mass was detected in the saphenous nerve. The second patient, a 16-year-old boy, noted subacute onset of pain in the popliteal fossa and decreased sensation in the distribution of the lateral sural cutaneous nerve. A mass was found within the tibial nerve at the knee level.

Intervention

In each patient, resection of the mass required sacrifice of a segment of the nerve.

Conclusion

In each patient, the mass was composed of fibrovascular tissue with osteoid and bone deposition arranged in a zonal pattern. The ossifying process was intraneural but encased rather than directly involving nerve fascicles. These exceptionally intact examples of neuritis ossificans underscore its resemblance to myositis ossificans. Nerve-sparing resection of such masses is not always possible.

### Surgical excision of post-traumatic myositis ossificans of the adductor longus in a football player [^11627kKr]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

Treatment

Surgical excision of the MOT was performed. Incision was made in the direction of Langer's lines at the level of the palpable mass. Subsequently, the great saphenous vein was ligated. After identification of the mass, it was peeled off the adductor longus muscle in one piece (figures 2 and 3). The muscle belly and adductor longus fascia were sutured with Vicryl and the skin was closed intracutaneously with Monocryl.

Discussion

MOT of the adductor muscles in athletes has been described previously. However, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first case reported in the literature of MOT of the adductor longus muscle. In football players, MOT is often the result of direct contusion of the adductor muscles or eccentric muscle overload that leads to an acute muscle/tendon injury. The latter was the trauma mechanism in the present case. Muscle tears can cause intermuscular and intramuscular hematoma formation, which is known to be an important event in the cascade of MOT. To minimise hematoma formation at the injury site, first aid following the rest, ice, compression and elevation principle is recommended. In this case, it is not clear whether the patient has followed this therapy sufficiently to prevent the development of MOT. Local inflammation and macrophage accumulation are also crucial steps in the cascade of heterotopic ossification formation, stimulating osteogenic factors, including bone morphogenetic proteins. Hence, NSAID is proposed to prevent MOT in an early phase. On the other hand, NSAIDs block the cyclooxygenase-2 pathway which is an essential pathway for skeletal muscle repair and muscle growth. The effect of the preventive use of NSAIDs in the early phase of MOT is controversial and warrants further investigation. In this case, NSAIDs were prescribed in the late phase as they had not yet been used and we felt it was worth trying both to reduce the pain and to try and prevent further formation. We also considered starting with ESWT. Due to the relatively large size of the calcification, we expected that the ESWT would take many sessions and be very painful. After discussing this with the patient, he decided not to try this.

The patient has been treated with canakinumab approximately 3.5 mg/kg/month for more than 16 months, with a relatively low flare rate of approximately one every 25 days (Fig. 5). The lumps involved in almost all of these flares are the same: at the left scapular base and within the right sternocleidomastoid muscle. We documented a decrease in the size of the left scapular lump from 4.5 × 4.5 cm to 3.5 × 2.5 cm within 2 weeks after subcutaneous injection of canakinumab, without the addition of corticosteroids (Fig. 8).

### Idiopathic spontaneous occurrence of heterotrophic occurrence during pregnancy [^1112q1kj]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Heterotopic ossification (HO) is the formation of ectopic bone within the soft tissues.HO can be classified into three broad categories based on etiology: traumatic HO from fractures, dislocations, orthopaedic surgeries, and burns; neurogenic HO from spinal cord damage or head injury; and genetic HO from conditions, such as progressive fibrodysplasia ossificans or progressive osseous heteroplasia. Traumatic HO comprises up to 90% of cases, most commonly a complication of arthroplasty or bone fracture, with a higher predisposition for men. Although it can occur anywhere in the body, HO typically affects areas most susceptible to trauma, such as the elbow, thigh, pelvis, and shoulder.

When symptomatic, HO can present with pain, decreased range of motion, and in severe cases, bony ankylosis. The diagnosis is made with radiographic imaging, including radiographs, CT, and MRI. Several classification systems have been used to grade the severity of HO, but the Brooker Classification System used for HO at the hipand the Hastings and Graham System for HO at the elboware two of the most commonly used.

A definitive diagnosis of HO can be made by histopathologic evaluation of a tissue sample. HO is often defined pathologically by the type of tissue in which it occurs, such as myositis ossificans involving skeletal muscle. The histopathologic features of the lesion typically evolve over time, with early lesions being composed of cellular fibrovascular tissue with small amounts of bone matrix. More mature lesions have prominent bone formation with a zonal architecture, a hallmark of HO. It is important to differentiate HO from a neoplastic process, such as soft-tissue sarcoma or osteosarcoma. Microscopically, in more mature lesions, trabeculae of woven bone with osteoblastic rimming accompanied by more mature lamellar bone is more consistent with HO, rather than osteosarcoma. The treatment of clinically significant HO is surgical resection. Milder forms may be managed conservatively with NSAIDs and physical therapy.

In the absence of trauma, neurologic dysfunction, or a genetic disorder, HO is rare. We report a case of HO of the shoulder presenting as abrupt onset pain in the setting of pregnancy, without any preceding trauma, neurologic dysfunction, or genetic etiology.

Complications

Possible complications of muscle injuries are muscle hernia, acute or chronic exertional compartment syndrome, myositis ossificans, calcific myonecrosis, and Morel-Lavallée lesions. Muscle hernias manifest in herniation of the muscle tissue through a small fascial defect in relation to a prior blunt or penetrating muscle trauma (Fig. 9). Muscle hernias increase in size during activity and can sometimes be indetectable during rest periods, thus making dynamic or standing ultrasound a requirement.

Fig. 9

Axial T1 (a), T2 (b), and post contrast T1f-weighted (c) MR images demonstrate a muscle hernia of the peroneus longus muscle with outpouching of the muscle through the antero-lateral investing fascia. The hernia follows the imaging characteristics of the muscle tissue in all sequences. There was a history of direct trauma while playing soccer 1 year ago, presumably resulting in a tear of the investing fascia. The patient noted an increase in size during training/muscle activity.

Outcome and follow-up

Histopathological analysis showed a round nodulus consisting of bone tissue with bone trabeculae surrounded with osteoblast cells. No typical zones could be recognised and the centre of the nodulus did not contain any cells.

At 3 months of follow-up, the patient was free of symptoms and followed the rehabilitation programme at his local football club. Exercises were intensified using weights, as well as with cycling, running and resuming light training sessions. No abnormalities were found on physical examination of the adductors on palpation, stretching and resistance testing. Dynamometry showed adductor strength of 157 N on the right (R) and of 177 N on the left (L), add abductor strength as this is needed to calculate with adductor/abductor ratio of 1.03 R and 1.32 L.

At 5 months of follow-up, the patient, although not at full intensity, participated in football training sessions three times a week. Dynamometry showed adductor strength R of 181 N and L of 176 N, with adductor/abductor ratio of 1.16 R and 1.17 L.

After 7 months, the patient was fully recovered and participated in football matches without any pain. Dynamometry showed adductor strength R of 213 N and L of 190 N, with adductor/abductor ratio of 1.20 R and 1.10 L. All dynamometry outcomes collected during the follow-up period are presented in table 1 and figure 4.

### Imaging of hip and thigh muscle injury: a pictorial review [^1148MEES]. Insights Into Imaging (2019). Medium credibility.

A compartment syndrome is caused by muscle anoxia by an increasing pressure within the compartment. The chronic exertional compartment syndrome results from an increased compartment pressure during exercise and resolves with rest. An acute compartment syndrome, on the other hand, is a surgical emergency presenting in with pain, which is disproportionate to the injury. On MRI, there are often bilateral signal hyperintensity peaks at exercise with delayed return to normal signal (Fig. 10).

Exercise-induced compartment syndrome, (a) forearm prior to exercise, (b) post-exercise swelling and ground glass-like edema within the brachioradialis, and humeral head of pronator teres muscles (arrow), while the remainder of the flexor pronator muscle group appears normal, with the exception of flexor carpi ulnaris (dashed arrows).

Myositis ossificans (better: heterotopic ossification, as the condition is not an inflammatory process) is a common sequelae of muscle injuries. Initially, hematoma and edema are present. On MRI, there is a high signal intensity on fluid-sensitive images and an increased enhancement after contrast administration. After about 6 weeks, typical imaging features with a peripheral rim of ossification that progresses towards the center can be found (Fig. 11).

Morel-Lavallée lesions result from a closed degloving injury as a result of shear forces associated with a serve trauma and resulting separation of the subcutaneous tissue from fascia. On MRI, it is often accompanied with recurrent fluid accumulation, while the fluid is of variable signal intensity (Fig. 12).

### Radiological identification and analysis of soft tissue musculoskeletal calcifications [^114S6JLv]. Insights Into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Shape and patterns

The classic hydroxyapatite calcification has an amorphous and cloudlike appearance with a well-defined oval contour (Fig. 2). It can appear multiloculated and even show fluid-fluid levels. Linear calcifications can be related to calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPPD) crystal deposition. Punctate calcifications with arcs and rings will be seen in cartilage-forming tumours and are referred to as cartilaginous matrix mineralisation (Fig. 5).

Fig. 5
Enchondroma. Anteroposterior radiograph of the left knee shows a typical chondroid matrix mineralisation with arcs and rings in the tibia (arrowheads)

On the other hand, radiographs of ossifications will show a bone organisation with a distinct cortical and/or trabecular bone pattern (Fig. 3). Fatty bone marrow within trabecular spaces can be identified on CT and MRI (Fig. 3), narrowing greatly the differential diagnosis (Table 1). However, immature ossifications are not so well organised and may be more difficult to diagnose.

Table 1
Differential diagnosis of calcifications and ossifications according to their location

The most frequent aetiologies are in bold characters. CPPD, calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate; CRF, chronic renal failure; DISH, diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis; HADD, Hydroxyapatite deposition disease; MOC, myositis ossificans circumscripta; RDO, rapidly destructive osteoarthritis; SSc, progressive systemic sclerosis

Foreign bodies will often show a distinctive shape such as sharp and/or geometric borders helping identifying their nature (Fig. 4). Other patterns can be recognised — such as round calcifications with radiolucent centre in venous phleboliths; parallel lines in calcifications of arterial origin; or "rice-grain" calcification in parasitic infection — and will be discussed later.

### "Bone in the penis" or fasciitis ossificans of the penis-a first time description of a pseudo-tumor at an extraordinary site [^115MuZYQ]. BMC Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this case report, we present a unique instance of fasciitis ossificans occurring in an extraordinary location, which has not been previously documented. Specifically, the tumor originated from the glans penis. The description of this case aims to aid in the diagnostic evaluation of patients with unclear tumor formations of the urethra/penis.

Initially, soft tissue hyperplasia does not exhibit ossification. The development of ossification is a delayed but rapid process, typically occurring 2–6 weeks from onset until clinical presentation. Concurrently, bone tissue maturation occurs. The tumor typically reaches a characteristic macroscopic size of approximately 3 cm on average, but may occasionally grow larger. While often asymptomatic, it can manifest as tenderness, pain, bleeding, or neuropathic sensations. Radiological examination typically reveals a soft tissue tumor with circumscribed growth, without infiltration of underlying tissue. However, imaging findings are nonspecific and may pose challenges in differentiation from sarcoma. Thus far, spreading or progression to malignancies has not been reported. Given that resection is curative and recurrence appears to be associated only with incomplete resection, surgical excision should be the primary aim in every case, even if it results in functional impairment.

Fasciitis ossificans is characterized by abnormal, extraskeletal ossification in inflamed fascial tissue and can be reactive to trauma or surgery, or secondary to chronic inflammation. Histologically, it consists of fibroblastic connective tissue, cartilage, bone, and osteoid, distinguishing it from myositis ossificans, where active ossification is absent. The origin of the connective tissue is the primary distinguishing feature. However, due to ossification, misinterpretation as osteosarcoma can occur, leading to inappropriate treatment. Ubiquitin-specific protease 6 (USP6) rearrangements have been identified as a consistent marker in nodular fasciitis, confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and may offer diagnostic assistance in differentiating fasciitis ossificans as well.

Sources of error

Focal soft tissue hot spots have a wide range of causes, and this may lead to an incorrect diagnosis of skeletal disease on planar imaging. In striated muscle, for example, the causes of increased uptake include the following:
Repeated intramuscular injections of iron supplements
Haematoma/necrosis/sickle cell anaemia
Rhabdomyolysis (mechanical, toxic, electrical,…)
Muscular abscess
Primary tumours (rhabdomyosarcoma, other sarcomas)
Metastases from solid tumours
Poly(dermato)myositis (many causes)
Severe renal insufficiency/hypercalcaemia/malignant calcinosis/multiple myeloma
Myositis ossificans

Attenuation artefacts caused by metal parts or motion artefacts are generally obvious, as is tracer extravasation at the injection site due to (partly) paravenous injection. The most common artefacts are related to urinary tracer contamination in patients with dilatation, stasis or an anatomical variant of the urinary tract, especially after urological surgery, or contamination during urination. Imaging artefacts include the following:
Injection artefacts.
Imaging too early after injection, before the radiopharmaceutical has been optimally cleared from soft tissues.
Greater than necessary collimator to patient distance.
Patient movement.
Pubic or sacral lesions obscured by superposition of bladder activity.
Urine contamination or a urinary diversion reservoir.
Changing bladder activity during SPECT of the pelvic region.
Purely lytic lesions with decreased or absent tracer uptake.
Prosthetic implants, radiographic contrast materials or other attenuating artefacts which may obscure normal structures.
Homogeneously increased bony activity (e.g. 'superscan').
Renal failure.
Restraint artefacts caused by soft tissue compression.
Significant findings outside the area of interest may be missed if a limited study is performed.
Prior administration of a higher-energy radionuclide, or of a preceding examination with another 99m Tc radiopharmaceutical that accumulates in an organ that could obscure or confound skeletal activity.
Radiopharmaceutical degradation.

Some bone lesions may be purely or predominantly lytic and barely visible on planar bone scintigraphy when they are small (< 2 cm): multiple myeloma, infarction, osteonecrosis, haemangioma, or lytic bone metastases. These artefacts and sources of error may be avoided by an additional SPECT/CT acquisition.

### Phenotypic variability of osteogenesis imperfecta type V caused by an IFITM5 mutation [^1113cZGj]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2013). Low credibility.

HPC is described as a postoperative or postfracture soft-tissue mass that may be confused with osteosarcoma because of an accompanying inflammatory component. CT and MRI findings characterize HPC as exuberant bone formation, disproportionate to the size of the affected bone with extensive expansion beyond the region of fracture. The differential diagnosis includes intraosseous osteosarcoma with aggressive periosteal reaction, periosteal osteosarcoma, juxtacortical myositis ossificans, and large osteochondromata. However, in the 10 type V patients who experienced one or more occurrence of HPC the hyperplastic response did not appear as a tumor mass. Rather, the hyperplastic response was usually confined to localized overgrowth of bone at the fracture site seen on X-ray rather than presenting as a soft tissue mass (Fig. 1). Our patients experienced callus formation in their femurs, humeri, and ribs. Similar to our findings, Cheung and colleaguesreported a 65% incidence of HPC in OI type V patients, with one-half of the reactions occurring on or around the femurs. HPC has also been reported to involve the pelvis and forearms. In our cohort, HPC appeared to start from the periosteal region. In 1 patient (patient 5), postfracture calcification involved the plane between leg muscle bundles.

Another common radiographic finding in OI type V patients is the idiopathic calcification of the forearm interosseous membranes. The majority of our patients exhibited the mineralization phenomenon. Ossification was radiographically apparent in 1 patient by the age of 4 years. Images of the child's arm can be seen in Fig. 1. Although it may be assumed that calcification at these sites follows trauma, the relationship, if any, of the mechanism underlying interosseous membranes mineralization and hyperplasic callus is unknown. In this series, the two processes were not linked, in that ossification of the interosseous membrane between the radius and ulna and tibia and fibula were not coincident with the existence of HPC in the same patients. A question arises as to why HPC occurs in only about 50% of type V patients and, further, why is this absent in other OI syndromes?

Altogether, our data show the efficacy of treatment with anti-IL-1 agents in a FOP patient, and markedly increased levels of IL-1β during flares suggest a role for IL-1β in the pathogenesis of this disease, although it is too soon to conclude whether FOP may be included under the umbrella of auto-inflammatory syndromes. Anti-IL-1 agents may be effective in ameliorating the natural progression of FOP. Indeed, unlike the "standard" anti-inflammatory agents currently used for prophylaxis, anti-IL-1 agents were efficacious in lowering the rate and extent of heterotopic ossification in our patient. However, further exploration and international experience with other FOP patients are needed.

### Post-traumatic severe trismus caused by impairment of the masticatory muscle [^113mmotj]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Restriction of the mouth opening from a pathologic condition outside the temporomandibular joint is called a pseudo- or extra-articular ankylosis. The authors report two cases of severe post-traumatic pseudoankylosis. One case showed fibrous degeneration of the bilateral masseter muscles without a facial bone fracture, which caused severe trismus, a mouth opening of less than 2 mm, and gradually appeared after blunt injuries to the face. The other was a rare case accompanied with the bone formation in the masseter muscle and was diagnosed as myositis ossificans traumatica, which also presented as severe trismus, with a maximal mouth opening of 5 mm after facial violence. Both were surgically treated with dissection of the affected muscles. In addition, a hemicoronoidotomy was performed in the case of myositis ossificans traumatica. Although a conservative therapy with physical rehabilitation is the basic policy for the management of pseudoankylosis of the temporomandibular joint, a surgical treatment should be considered when the origin of the problems is an osteogenic character or severe extra-articular ankylosis resistant to conservative therapy before completion of true temporomandibular joint ankylosis.

### Performance of image-guided bone biopsies in malignant lesions: impact of PET / CT metabolic activity on the number of samples required [^113xLUNv]. Insights Into Imaging (2025). Medium credibility.

Such discrepancies may reflect either false-positive PET/CT results or false-negative biopsies, both of which are plausible in a retrospective setting. Although multiple factors may explain this, investigating them was beyond the scope of the current study. Indeed, FDG uptake can occur in inflammatory and infectious diseases, and both irradiation and immunotherapy may increase FDG uptake due to acute cellular responses to therapy in the early post-treatment phase. Conversely, certain chemotherapies may reduce FDG uptake due to a "stunning" effect. Therefore, interventional radiologists would benefit from familiarizing themselves with this imaging modality while being aware of its advantages and limitations. Furthermore, Kobayashi et al highlight several benign bone tumors associated with FDG uptake, including fibrous dysplasia, giant cell tumors, Paget's disease, non-ossifying fibromas, eosinophilic granulomas, aneurysmal bone cysts, enchondromas, and myositis ossificans. In this study, one biopsy led to a Paget result, which was considered non-malignant. They also noted that sclerotic bone metastases and some soft tissue neoplasms with low FDG uptake may be less suitable candidates for reducing the number of samples. These observations encourage caution, and radiologists should remain cognizant of the strengths and limitations of PET/CT, tailoring their approach to the clinical context. In this study, a total of 28 biopsy results were classified as non-malignant and were therefore excluded from the primary statistical analysis. These included histopathological diagnoses such as benign bone remodeling (n = 7), fibrosis (n = 6), chronic inflammatory changes (n = 5), bone infarct (n = 3), osteomyelitis (n = 2), Paget's disease (n = 1), and nonspecific findings (n = 4). Their exclusion was based on methodological considerations, as the retrospective design did not allow for systematic clinical or imaging follow-up to confidently distinguish true negatives from false-negative biopsy results. Including these cases in the main analysis could have introduced diagnostic uncertainty and limited the reliability of statistical comparisons. Nonetheless, these cases remain clinically relevant, particularly regarding the interpretation of FDG-PET signals. Some of the non-malignant lesions demonstrated increased FDG uptake, highlighting the well-known overlap between neoplastic, inflammatory, infectious, and some benign bone processes with high metabolic activity. In this context, it could be of interest in future work to include such cases within a prospective framework, allowing for longitudinal clinical and imaging follow-up to confirm the benign nature of the lesions and to assess the potential for PET/CT false positives in a more robust manner.

### British Society for Rheumatology guideline on management of paediatric, adolescent and adult patients with idiopathic inflammatory myopathy [^114A3Z9J]. Rheumatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Literature search — scope and search strategy

Using key questions as a basis, a literature search was undertaken using Ovid (see 'Search terms' in Supplementary Material S1, available at Rheumatology online). Search results and additional manually identified references up to October 2020 were included. Evidence published after October 2020 was not included as this was the cut-off for eligibility. A potential limitation of this guideline is that relevant literature may have been published since October 2020; data or information from these studies could not be included in the recommendation formation process.

Eligibility criteria

Published peer reviewed clinical studies relating to any IIM subtype except inclusion body myositis were included. Case reports/series were limited to those describing outcomes for three or more subjects. Review articles, editorials, conference proceedings, and existing clinical guidelines were excluded. Non-English language papers were excluded unless a translation was published. Basic science studies without clear clinical applicability were excluded. Abstracts of papers were reviewed by two authors to determine eligibility against these criteria (PRISMA flow diagram shown in Supplementary Fig. S1, available at Rheumatology online).

Methods used to formulate recommendations

The full text of each eligible paper was reviewed by two assessors using Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE) methodology. Each reference was categorized as high (A), moderate (B) or low/very low (C) quality. A third assessor resolved disagreements.

A total of 213 papers were used to form recommendations. See Supplementary Table S1 (available at Rheumatology online) for details of evidence base contributing to recommendations.

Draft recommendations were created and categorized as applicable to all patients, adult-specific or paediatric-specific. The process outlined by the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) was used to summarize the quality of body of evidence for each recommendation: high (A), moderate (B), low (C) or very low (D), according to GRADE methodology.

Content, wording, strength of recommendation (strong = 1, conditional = 2), and quality of supporting evidence for each recommendation were subjected to a formal consensus building process using a combination of face-to-face meetings and online surveys. Strength of agreement (SoA) for finalized recommendations was determined using a simple binary voting system for each voter and is presented as a percentage. Authors were free to abstain from voting on areas where they did not feel clinically competent, with the percentage reflecting voters. Only recommendations with a SoA > 80% were included in the guideline.

### Emerging treatment options for inclusion body myositis [^116nac95]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

Inclusion body myositis (IBM) is a disabling and progressive muscle disease with no effective disease-modifying therapies. This article summarizes recent advances in IBM therapeutics, analysing the reasons for historic trial failures and highlighting more promising contemporary approaches. Improved understanding of IBM's multifaceted pathogenesis has led to development of targeted approaches-including agents modulating autophagy, myostatin inhibition, and T-cell dysregulation. In addition to pharmacologic interventions, exercise-based strategies, robotics, and surgical procedures are being explored for symptom management. Dysphagia, a major contributor to morbidity, is receiving increased attention through both conservative and interventional approaches.

### Proceedings of the 31st European paediatric rheumatology congress: part 1 [^113TF6Xa]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods: Report of a case with follow-up for 6 years.

Results: The parents of a 2 years and 4 months old boy, previously healthy, noticed limited mobility with a fixed flexion at 100°, and a bulk in the right elbow.

Without clear trauma, he did not have fever or any other systemic or organ-specific symptoms.

Radiographs show a calcified mass at humerus-ulnar joint.

Bone scintigraphy shows an abnormal increased uptake in the lower third of the right humeral diaphysis, and magnetic resonance confirm a exophytic osteochondral bulk that originates in the proximal ulna and compromises the humeroulnar joint, with edema of bone, and adjacent soft tissues.

Biopsy: reactive bone process.

The tumor increased twice its original size in the subsequent months and the elbow remained rigid at 90 degrees.

After trauma we tried treatment with ibuprofen and pamidronate, 0.1 mg/kg weight for three consecutive days, without results.

Secuencing of the GNAS gene to rule out POH, and ACVR1 gene to rule out FOP did not show pathogenic variants.

In 2022 consultation with Frederick S. Kaplan, M.D. concludes that due to the very strange ossification pattern, the evolution, and the genetic results, rule out FOP and POH, and corresponding a circumscribed myositis, POH like of unknown cause.

A Positron Emission Tomography was carried out in 2022 that showns a extensive calcified process in the soft tissues without hypermetabolism that suggests inflammatory activity.

Conclusion: We present a case of an ultra-rare pathology, which involved a complex diagnostic process. Initially the challenge was to rule out malignant causes, and those amenable to medical intervention, and in the evolution, the decision of whether or not to perform an excision procedure, which could cause thrust and increase in heterotopic ossification.

### Pelvic heterotopic ossification: when CT comes to the aid of MR imaging [^1163RCAm]. Insights Into Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

HO distribution and sites of origin

The most common sites of neurogenic pelvis ossification are the iliac, ileopsoas or vastus muscle areas.

According to the literature, the initial HO process can originate inside a muscle or extend into a bursa. In cases of primary muscle involvement, initial ossification starts in the peripheral tissue due to oedema and capillary stasis following muscle denervation. The pathogenesis of HO is similar to that of circumscribed myositis ossificans; therefore, it manifests many of the same imaging features, including T2/short TI inversion recovery (STIR) hyperintensity and some peripheral enhancement. Muscles initially involved in the ossification process show diffuse hyperintensity on T2/STIR images with or without some heterogeneity within them. The corresponding CT appearance consists of a certain degree of swelling of the muscle, which can contain some peripheral calcification or immature ossification (Fig. 1).

Fig. 1
A 58-year-old paraplegic man, post trauma. a On axial STIR a diffuse increased signal intensity involving the right obturator externus-adductor muscles suggests an inflammatory reaction as observed in the early phase of ossification. b On CT axial scan a circumscribed amorphous calcification showing ill-defined margins and no trabecular structure is evident within the periphery of the adductor brevis muscle belly

Bursae are other sites where HO can take place initially and progress to compression of the adjacent muscles. Some areas of elevated signal intensity on T2-weighted images with rim contrast enhancement may represent fluid-filled merged bursae or inclusion within the ossification itself (Fig. 2). In cases of primary bursal involvement, it is not always possible to differentiate HO from pressure-related calcified bursitis that can evolve in ossification (Fig. 3).

### Identification of risk factors in the development of heterotopic ossification after primary total hip arthroplasty [^117QkdYp]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

There are several limitations to our study. First, it is a single-institution, retrospective study by data extraction, which resulted in some variables (eg, osteomalacia, motor vehicle accident, radiation therapy) having too few observations to gain significance or power to be used in regression analysis. This was seen in variables known to be associated with HO including metabolic bone disorders such as myositis ossificans progressiva and risk factors such as burn history.

Also, in determining the indication for surgery in our patient population, 9.6% of primary hip arthroplasties were performed in the setting of an acute fracture. As noted earlier, fracture rates preceding total hip arthroplasty are generally low. This number may reflect a misclassification of distant fractures as acute fractures or may represent a higher rate of hip arthroplasties performed for the treatment of acute fractures at our institution. Although the presence of an acute fracture was not significantly associated with the outcome of HO, a differential misclassification may decrease the interpretation of our results in relation to individuals with perioperative fracture.

As with other retrospective record reviews, the quality of data is dependent on the accuracy and coding of medical records. As seen in a study by Fury et al, an evaluation in the accuracy of coding for HO in 522 patients showed that 38% of patients with an HO-specific ICD-9 code had no evidence of HO documented in their EMR, and only 48% of patients with traumatic injury preceding HO formation had documentation of HO in their EMR. Additionally, due to limitations of the data extraction, nuance can be lost, and there may be areas of missing data. In our initial data extraction, there was missing data for 122 patients. On our EMR system, there was a transition between data storage software in 2012. We speculate that during this EMR storage transition information did not crossover for these 122 patients. With limited granularity on descriptors such as medications, many of the variables were assigned categorical descriptions. For each disease state, nonpositive cases were coded as not having the comorbid condition, which could have been a limitation in EMR coding and underestimated the prevalence of these conditions. It is likely that our HO reporting rate is an underestimate due to lack of documentation in the EMR, especially as HO is often undocumented unless it causes pain or functional limitations.

P392. Adolescent with idiopathic myositis ossification in deltoid: a case report

N. Choon Seong

Rheumatology, Hospital Selayang, Selayang, Malaysia

Correspondence: N. Choon Seong

Introduction: Focal myositis belongs to rare type V idiopathic inflammatory myopathy. Though it is rare, prognosis is generally good.

Objectives: Herein, I presented a case of left deltoid focal myositis, of which responded well to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.

Methods: Case Report

Results: A 17 years old girl presented with two months' history of left arm myalgia without proximal muscle weakness. No history of trauma. No constitutional symptoms. No dysphagia. No symptoms suggestive of connective tissue disease. Physical examination revealed localized redness and tenderness over left deltoid but did not show any cutaneous signs of dermatomyositis. Inflammatory marker of erythrocyte sedimentation rate was elevated (17 mm/hr). Creatinine kinase level was normal. Antinuclear antibody, myositis panel, extractable nuclear antigen as well as culture for tuberculosis and fungal were negative. MRI showed diffuse short tau inversion recovery hyperintense signal over the left deltoid muscle. No evidence of enhancing mass and no collection. Muscle biopsy demonstrated inflammatory infiltrate in the perimysium and endomysium with presence of CD4+ T cells. No granuloma. Sarcoma was ruled out. A diagnosis of focal deltoid myositis was made. She was started on nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and so far no relapse was seen.

Conclusion: The current case has shown the importance of excluding differential diagnosis before reaching conclusion on such a rare entity. Second line agent may not be required in this case as the pain did not recur and there were no extra-skeletal manifestations.

### Genetic and environmental risk factors for idiopathic inflammatory myopathies [^112Wn7TU]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

Although the studies discussed are beginning to reveal a number of genetic and possible environmental risk factors for myositis, further investigations are needed to fully understand and classify these syndromes. The difficulties in this process include small numbers of subjects with varying disease phenotypes available for study, polygenic risk factors for which it remains unclear which are primary and which are secondary or linked genes, and the lack of validated environmental exposure assessment tools. New technologies and international collaborative approaches, however, may overcome some of these difficulties and allow us to identify genetic and environmental risk factors, as well as the critical gene-environment interactions in the IIM and its subgroups. Nonetheless, our understanding of these diseases is still in the early stages. Although we have learned a great deal about these disorders through detailed investigations over the last several decades, we have even further to go to understand the environmental triggers and genetic susceptibilities for the myositis syndromes.

P096 Rare case of progressive myositis ossificans circumscripta

Rodrigo Suárez

Pediatric Rheumatology, CHPR, Montevideo, Uruguay

Pediatric Rheumatology 2024, 22(2): PReS24-ABS-1114

Introduction: Heterotopic ossification is a very rare pathology, most frequently self-limited and following trauma. When ossification progresses over time we should think about Progressive osseous heteroplasia (POH) and Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP). FOP is a genetic condition (mutation in activin receptor IA) characterized by progressive heterotopic ossification in specific anatomic patterns.

Most cases of POH are caused by mutations in the GNAS gene, starts in the dermis, and progresses into the deep tissue.

Objectives: Report the case of a patient with an ultra-rare entity that causes progressive soft tissue ossification, its diagnostic process and clinical evolution.

Results. Representative examples of tumoral calcinosis, fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP), posttraumatic myositis ossificans, dermatomyositis, extraosseous osteosarcoma, desmoid pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism (PPHP), venolymphatic malformation, Maffucci syndrome, brown fat necrosis, and pilomatricoma within the soft tissues are presented. Within the chest and abdomen, cases of inflammatory fibroblastic pseudotumor, meconium peritonitis, graft versus host disease (GVHD), retroperitoneal teratoma, ovarian and testicular torsion, testicular germ cell tumor, pancreatic calcifications, renal calcification, and bladder calculi are demonstrated.

Discussion and conclusions. Extraosseous calcifications in children are usually related to renal and gallbladder calculi. However, there is a large number of disease processes within children that may result in unusual calcifications. Proper recognition of these calcific foci can aid in establishing a definitive diagnosis which may direct appropriate therapy.

### Heterotopic ossification after total knee arthroplasty [^111cJbqG]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2003). Low credibility.

The incidence of heterotopic ossification (HO) after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and its effect on the postoperative range of motion (ROM) were assessed in 63 primary TKAs. Twenty-five of 63 knees (39%) showed postoperative HO, most of which were found in the region anterior to the distal femur. The incidence of HO was significantly higher (P < .05) in the osteoarthritic knees than in the rheumatoid knees. Significant positive correlation was seen between the preoperative grade of osteophyte formation and the incidence of postoperative HO. The ROM in the knees with HO was not significantly different than that in the knees without HO at 1 year after surgery. Thus, we concluded that HO after TKA is a self-limiting condition and its pathogenesis is completely different from that of myositis ossificance.

### Difficulties in early diagnosis of myositis ossificans… [^117UoqEo]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Myositis ossificans is a benign condition in which there is degeneration of muscle and connective tissue, followed by replacement of these structures with a cellular fibrous tissue that eventually becomes ossified. The usual case of myositis ossificans circumscripta has a definite history of injury to the involved part, followed by pain and swelling in that area. Finally, after several weeks, the typical cloud-like formation of calcified tissue is seen in the muscle mass adjacent to the bone. Ordinarily there is little difficulty in diagnosing this condition. In the atypical case, however, the diagnosis may become difficult. This case was such a problem. Because of this patient's unusual history and symptoms and because of the problems involved in the differential diagnosis, we feel justified in reporting this case. REPORT OF A CASE An 8-year-old boy was brought to our office March 10, 1951, for routine orthopedic examination. He was under treatment Weinstein L, Fraerman SH, Lewin P.

### Myositis ossificans… [^112wh5Zo]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Cases of circumscribed myositis ossificans have been reported with increasing frequency during the last few years. It is probable that the condition is more common than even the large number of reported cases would indicate, for when ossification is not extensive and not in such a position that the motion of a joint is limited or a definite disability occurs, a physician is not consulted. The circumscribed form of myositis ossificans is of special interest to the surgeon because of its association with dislocations and fractures; because of the difficulties sometimes encountered in making a differential diagnosis, and because of the relation of periosteal stripping and displacement to heterologous bone formation. Three forms of circumscribed myositis are recognized: The traumatic: Occupational myositis ossifications due as a rule to repeated injuries. Myositis ossificans due to repeated injuries not sustained in pursuit of an occupation. Myositis ossificans due to LEWIS D.

### Myositis ossificans… [^1156EHAu]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

JenniferReiling, Editorial Assistant The calcareous degeneration of certain tissues is a well-known fact, but the formation of true bone in the tissues, not normally thus developing, and apart from any direct connection with the natural bony growths, is still to some extent a pathologic curiosity. This is especially true of the ossifications of the muscles, of which a comparatively small number of cases have been reported in medical literature. Dr. Lydia M. DeWitt reports1 a case, with the discussion of the literature of this subject, in part honestly acknowledged as second-hand, with the theories that have been proposed to account for the condition. The fact that in certain animals the so-called splint bones occur has a certain physiological bearing, but the facts do not fully apply to the human subject. The curious malformation that has been observed in some 75 per cent.

of the recorded cases of this disease of microdactylia and imperfection of the thumb and great toe is of great interest, and is one of the unexplained but indefinitely suggestive peculiarities that we sometimes meet with in connection with obscure diseases. Dr. DeWitt's idea seems to be that on the whole the condition is not so mysterious a one as might be supposed. The fact that different members of the connective-tissue group change with special readiness into other forms of connective-tissue structure is, she holds, a probably sufficient explanation, lacking others a little more definite. She does not consider the suggestion of Gegenbaur, of specialized osteoplastic nuclei existing from before birth, as necessary to account for the pathologic bone formation. The cells which in certain regions act as osteoblasts are not, she thinks, necessarily histogenetically different from those which in other localities develop into fibrous connective tissue.

The subject is by no means definitely cleared up, but her communication is a reasonable discussion of the facts and probabilities. MYOSITIS OSSIFICANS. JAMA. 2000; 284:

### Myositis ossificans progressiva… [^111hLVyk]. publications.aap.org (2025). Medium credibility.

Four new cases of myositis ossificans progressiva have been presented and the literature on the subject has been reviewed. At the onset typical cases will usually develop palpable masses over the fascial planes of the head and neck. Biopsy of these lesions suggests tumor tissue but this subsequently goes on to calcification and ossification. This point illustrates that the disease title — myositis ossificans — is really a misnomer since there is no calcification of muscles themselves but rather a calcification of the connective tissue between the muscles. When the disease progresses as illustrated by the cases reported, they frequently present themselves with gait or posture disturbance or with other orthopedic complaints. Microdactylism and hallux valgus deformity of the great toe are two of the outstanding findings. The cases reported illustrate the various stages of the disease under discussion.

From inflammation, swelling, induration of the muscles and connective tissues to tumefaction, the disease finally progresses to calcification in from 2 to 8 months. Finally, the calcification progresses to ossification and severe crippling. Serial illustrations and roentgenograms on several of these cases illustrate these progressive changes. All biochemical determinations have been normal but marked subjective improvement following cortisone therapy in one early case suggests the possible relationship of this disease process to disturbed steroid metabolism.
