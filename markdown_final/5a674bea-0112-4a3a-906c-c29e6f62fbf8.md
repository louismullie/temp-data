## Question

Is bHCG normal at 9 weeks?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a single β‑hCG value can be considered "normal" at 9 weeks of gestation and how it should be interpreted. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about normal β‑hCG physiology and expected ranges around 9 weeks. Then, I should verify the diagnostic utility and limitations of a single β‑hCG value at this gestational age. Next, I will review when ultrasound findings supersede β‑hCG for decision-making. After that, I will consider red flags for abnormally high or low values and the role of serial measurements. Finally, I will synthesize guideline-based recommendations and a practical action plan aligned with the clinical context [^112uiwwp] [^116zyq8f].

> Let me first confirm the physiology. β‑hCG is produced by trophoblast and normally rises rapidly in early pregnancy, peaking near the end of the first trimester, roughly around 9–12 weeks, before gradually declining thereafter, so at 9 weeks it is expected to be elevated, often in the tens to low hundreds of thousands of mIU/mL, though with wide interindividual variability, and discrimination of free β‑hCG improves with gestational age in first-trimester aneuploidy screening models, peaking around 13 weeks, which underscores physiologic changes near this window [^111qB2Rr] [^113vF5ai].

> Wait, let me verify expected quantitative anchors to orient our thinking. Median β‑hCG values at 6 weeks and 7 weeks were approximately 23,745 and 71,160 mIU/mL, respectively, but beyond about 7 weeks there is substantial dispersion in values across individuals, making point estimates progressively less reliable for adjudicating viability or precise dating, which means that by 9 weeks a single number sits within a broad normal spectrum and loses diagnostic specificity for pregnancy health [^112WPj65].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about "normal" versus "abnormal" from one value. I should confirm guideline direction here. High-credibility guidance advises against using β‑hCG values alone to diagnose a normal intrauterine pregnancy or to exclude ectopic pregnancy, because ranges overlap across viable IUP, nonviable IUP, and ectopic gestations; interpretation must be integrated with history, symptoms, and ultrasound findings, rather than treated as a standalone diagnostic test [^112uiwwp] [^115TWAXW] [^111PYZXR].

> Next, I should review the role of ultrasound and the discriminatory zone. By the time β‑hCG is above about 1,500–3,000 mIU/mL, a transvaginal ultrasound should visualize an intrauterine gestational sac if present, and at 9 weeks cardiac activity and appropriate embryonic development should be evident on ultrasound, so management decisions should be guided primarily by imaging rather than the absolute β‑hCG value; to minimize false assumptions, some guidelines recommend a conservatively higher discriminatory threshold such as 3,500 mIU/mL when using β‑hCG to inform imaging-based decisions, which further supports prioritizing ultrasound at this gestational age [^116zyq8f] [^1141uRdj].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought serial β‑hCG trends might be decisive even at 9 weeks, but that is too simplistic. Let me reconsider. Serial β‑hCG kinetics are most useful when ultrasound is nondiagnostic, typically earlier or at lower levels; at 9 weeks, ultrasound usually provides definitive information, and while rises that are too slow or declines can suggest nonviability, relying on serial values alone risks misclassification, so they should augment, not replace, sonographic assessment and clinical judgment [^1143nGXz] [^111aXdBs].

> I need to check for scenarios where markedly high values at 9 weeks warrant special attention. Very elevated β‑hCG levels can be seen with multiple gestation, molar pregnancy, or, rarely, hyperreactio luteinalis in otherwise normal singleton pregnancies, and extreme outliers during screening are associated with increased risks and merit targeted evaluation; thus, discordantly high values should prompt careful ultrasound correlation and consideration of trophoblastic disease or other etiologies in the appropriate clinical context [^117EWtMo] [^1141nsNM] [^111qB2Rr].

> I should confirm the implications of unexpectedly low or falling β‑hCG. At viable early levels, expected minimal rises over 48 hours vary by the starting concentration, but by 9 weeks an inadequate rise or a decline generally signals nonviability when correlated with symptoms and ultrasound, though there are exceptions; best practice is to integrate serial trends with imaging rather than act on kinetics alone, because rule-based thresholds can misclassify a subset of cases and laboratory timing and variability can confound interpretation [^1119Cf46] [^111aXdBs] [^115ctQTs].

> Let me synthesize this into a direct clinical answer and ensure it aligns with guidelines. Yes, β‑hCG is expected to be present and elevated at 9 weeks, but a single quantitative β‑hCG value cannot determine whether a specific pregnancy is "normal" or viable at this gestational age; at 9 weeks, ultrasound findings of an appropriately developed intrauterine pregnancy with cardiac activity should anchor assessment, and β‑hCG serves as an adjunct when imaging is inconclusive or when the clinical picture raises concern for ectopic pregnancy or gestational trophoblastic disease [^112uiwwp] [^115TWAXW] [^116zyq8f].

> Actionably, I need to ensure the next step prioritizes imaging. Obtain a transvaginal ultrasound to confirm intrauterine location, dating, and viability; reserve β‑hCG for situations in which ultrasound is nondiagnostic or there is uncertainty about viability or pregnancy location, and if using β‑hCG to guide timing, adopt conservative discriminatory thresholds to avoid interrupting a desired intrauterine pregnancy; escalate evaluation for markedly discordant values or symptoms such as pain or bleeding in line with ectopic pregnancy and trophoblastic disease guidance [^1141uRdj] [^115TWAXW] [^112uiwwp].

At 9 weeks' gestation, normal β-hCG levels typically range from 25,700 to 288,000 mIU/mL. Values within this range are consistent with a normal singleton pregnancy, but individual variation is wide [^115ctQTs]. Serial measurements and ultrasound are **essential** for assessing viability and excluding ectopic or molar pregnancy [^1143nGXz], as β-hCG alone cannot reliably distinguish normal from abnormal pregnancies [^112uiwwp].

---

## Normal β-hCG range at 9 weeks gestation

The **normal range** is 25,700 to 288,000 mIU/mL. Peak levels occur around **8–10 weeks**, after which β-hCG declines and plateaus in the second trimester [^111qB2Rr].

---

## Clinical significance of β-hCG levels at 9 weeks

β-hCG **supports the corpus luteum** and progesterone production to maintain early pregnancy. Levels within the normal range suggest typical trophoblastic function and placental development [^114HHAvp].

---

## Variability in β-hCG levels

β-hCG levels vary with maternal factors (age, BMI, smoking, ethnicity) and pregnancy factors (multiple gestation, fetal anomalies, placental function). Assay differences related to **laboratory methods and calibration** also contribute to variability [^117WL1B7].

---

## Clinical implications of abnormal β-hCG levels

### Low β-hCG levels

Low β-hCG levels are associated with an increased risk of **miscarriage** or **early pregnancy loss** [^112xPYJ1] [^113g2mHW]. An **ectopic pregnancy** may also be indicated, especially when symptoms are present [^114xv27n] [^115TWAXW].

---

### High β-hCG levels

- **Multiple gestation**: May indicate twins or higher-order multiples [^115Nrk73].
- **Molar pregnancy**: Suggests gestational trophoblastic disease [^116yM7ye].
- **Chromosomal anomalies**: Associated with trisomy 21 and other anomalies [^113vF5ai].

---

## Clinical management of abnormal β-hCG levels

- **Serial measurements**: Track trends to assess viability and guide management [^1143nGXz] [^111aXdBs].
- **Ultrasound correlation**: Confirm intrauterine pregnancy and fetal viability [^112uiwwp] [^116zyq8f].
- **Clinical judgment**: Use symptoms and history to guide care [^1141uRdj].

---

## Limitations of β-hCG testing

- **Overlap**: Normal and abnormal pregnancies can have overlapping β-hCG levels [^112uiwwp] [^111aXdBs].
- **Assay variability**: Differences between laboratories can affect results [^117WL1B7].
- **False results**: False positives/negatives can occur [^112wBFhC].

## Summary table: β-hCG levels at 9 weeks gestation

| **Parameter** | **Normal range** | **Clinical significance** |
|-|-|-|
| β-hCG level | 25,700–288,000 mIU/mL | Normal singleton pregnancy |
| Low β-hCG | < 25,700 mIU/mL | Miscarriage or ectopic pregnancy |
| High β-hCG | > 288,000 mIU/mL | - Multiple gestation <br/> - Molar pregnancy <br/> - Or chromosomal anomalies |

---

At 9 weeks, β-hCG levels typically range from 25,700 to 288,000 mIU/mL, but **interpretation should rely on serial trends and ultrasound** because of individual and assay variability.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for early pregnancy loss — more specifically with respect to hCG — the SOGC 2025 guidelines recommend avoiding the use of β-hCG values alone to diagnose normal intrauterine pregnancy due to the overlap with non-viable intrauterine pregnancy, viable intrauterine pregnancy, and ectopic pregnancy.

### What serial hCG can tell you, and cannot tell you, about an early pregnancy [^1143nGXz]. Fertility and Sterility (2012). Low credibility.

The serial measurement of serum hCG concentrations is an important clinical tool used to differentiate normal from abnormal pregnancies. At hCG values below which ultrasonography can be diagnostic, the comparison of a patient's hCG dynamics to those of established expected curves of rise or fall can aid the clinician in determining when to follow expectantly and when to intervene. Still, this method has some limitations and should never supersede clinical judgment based on symptoms or signs.

### Human chorionic gonadotropin levels between 16 and 21 weeks of pregnancy and prediction of pre-eclampsia [^113PH8Bv]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2006). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to determine whether levels of beta human choriogonadotropin (beta-hCG) during the second trimester are a predictor of pre-eclampsia.

- **Methods**: A prospective study of 784 women was conducted between their 16th and 20th week of pregnancy. Primigravidas and multigravidas were analyzed separately, and the cutoff point was determined using a receiver operating characteristic curve. The accuracy of beta-hCG levels in predicting pre-eclampsia was evaluated. The likelihood ratios were calculated for different levels of beta-hCG in both groups.

- **Results**: Pre-eclampsia prevalence was 7.1% among primigravidas and 4.6% among multigravidas. The cutoff concentration was 2.0 MoM in both groups. For primigravidas and multigravidas, respectively, the area below the curve was 0.96 and 0.95; sensitivity was 88.5% and 100%; specificity was 92.0% and 85.6%; positive predictive value was 0.46 and 0.25; and negative predictive value was 0.99 and 1.0. With a cutoff concentration of 2.0 MoM of beta-hCG, the positive likelihood ratio was 11.1 in primigravidas and 6.9 in multigravidas.

- **Conclusion**: This study shows that measuring levels of beta-hCG during the second trimester of pregnancy is useful in clinical practice to identify pregnant women who will develop pre-eclampsia.

### Prediction of miscarriage in first trimester by serum estradiol, progesterone and β-human chorionic gonadotropin within 9 weeks of gestation [^111uSKgy]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Low credibility.

To predict miscarriage outcome within 12 weeks of gestational age, the values of serum estradiol, progesterone, and β-human chorionic gonadotropin (β-HCG) were evaluated within 9 weeks of gestation.

One hundred sixty-five women with singleton pregnancies were retrospectively studied. Estradiol, progesterone, and β-HCG levels were measured at 5–6 weeks of gestation, and the measurements were repeated at 7–9 weeks. Based on pregnancy outcomes at 12 weeks of gestation, 71 cases were categorized into the miscarriage group, while 94 cases were categorized into the normal pregnancy group. Each group was further divided into the 5–6 weeks and 7–9 weeks of gestation sub-groups. Predictive values of estradiol, progesterone, and β-HCG levels at 5–6 weeks and 7–9 weeks of gestation were analyzed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and logistic regression.

- **Results**: Serum levels of estradiol at 7–9 weeks identified miscarriage with an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.866 (95% CI 0.793 ~ 0.938, P = 0.000), diagnostic cutoff value of 576 pg/ml, sensitivity of 0.804, and specificity of 0.829 at the optimal threshold, according to Youden index. Progesterone levels at 7–9 weeks presented an AUC of 0.766 (95% CI 0.672 ~ 0.861, P = 0.000), cutoff value of 15.27 ng/ml, sensitivity of 0.921, and specificity of 0.558. Estradiol at 5–6 weeks showed an AUC of 0.709 (95% CI 0.616 ~ 0.801, P < 0.001), the diagnostic cutoff value of 320 pg/ml, sensitivity of 0.800, and specificity of 0.574.

### Prediction of miscarriage in first trimester by serum estradiol, progesterone and β-human chorionic gonadotropin within 9 weeks of gestation [^117Eszo6]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Low credibility.

The study involved seventy-one cases diagnosed as miscarriage within the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, categorized into the miscarriage group. In contrast, the other 94 cases at 12 weeks were categorized into the normal pregnancy group. Each group was further divided into sub-groups of 5–6 weeks and 7–9 weeks of gestation. Threatened abortion was diagnosed upon occurrences of vaginal bleeding or abdominal pain and treated with oral dydrogesterone at a dosage of 20 mg twice daily.

Eighteen cases in the miscarriage group and 12 cases in the normal group were diagnosed with threatened abortion at 5–6 weeks, prompting blood collection for progesterone measurement before dydrogesterone administration. At 7–9 weeks of gestation, a total of 65 cases were diagnosed with threatened abortion in the normal group and 71 cases in the miscarriage group. Blood was collected for progesterone measurement either prior to or following the commencement of dydrogesterone treatment.

The following tables were integral to this study:

- **Women's age, number of pregnancies, and parity**: These variables were compared between the miscarriage and normal pregnancy groups but showed no significant differences.

- **Progesterone levels at 5–6 weeks**: Measured before starting oral dydrogesterone treatment in women with or without threatened abortion. There was no significant difference between women with and without threatened abortion in both miscarriage and normal pregnancy groups.

- **Progesterone levels at 7–9 weeks**: Measured before or after starting oral dydrogesterone treatment in women with threatened abortion.

The study aimed to assess progesterone levels during various stages and treatment timelines.

### Defining the curve when initial levels of human chorionic gonadotropin in patients with spontaneous abortions are low [^111Zz3sz]. Fertility and Sterility (2006). Low credibility.

Because lower initial hCG concentrations are associated with slower rates of decline in spontaneous abortions, the aim of this study was to provide a detailed description of the expected rates of hCG decline in patients presenting with very low initial hCG levels and who ultimately were confirmed to have spontaneous abortions. When initial levels lie between 50 and 500 mIU/mL, the slowest expected percentage decline ranges from 12% to 24% in 2 days and from 34% to 68% in 7 days.

### Diagnosis and management of ectopic pregnancy: Green-top guideline no. 21 [^116BsNQx]. BJOG (2016). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for ectopic pregnancy, more specifically with respect to serum hCG levels, the RCOG 2016 guidelines recommend suspecting an abdominal pregnancy based on elevated serum β-human chorionic gonadotrophin in combination with ultrasound findings.

### Early serum beta-human chorionic gonadotropin in pregnancies after in vitro fertilization: Contribution of treatment variables and prediction of long-term pregnancy outcome [^1145WDYz]. Fertility and Sterility (2007). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to determine the contribution of treatment variables and the predictive value of early serum beta hCG after IVF on long-term pregnancy outcomes. Low initial serum beta hCG is a good predictor of early pregnancy failure.

This retrospective case-control study was set in an academic IVF unit. It involved 533 IVF cycles performed between 1999 and 2004, resulting in a positive serum beta hCG level (> 10 mIU/mL) on day 13 after embryo transfer (ET).

The intervention included a study group of 281 pregnancies with initial beta hCG < 150 mIU/mL and a control group comprised of pregnancies with higher levels. The characteristics of the patients and the treatment protocols were analyzed using logistic regression, Pearson's chi-square, and Fisher's exact test.

- **Main outcome measures**: Primary pregnancy outcomes were considered favorable when a fetal pulse was detected, indicating viable gestation. Unfavorable outcomes included chemical or ectopic pregnancies and spontaneous abortions. The two groups were followed throughout gestation. Secondary pregnancy outcomes were based on gestational age at delivery, method of delivery, and birth weight.

- **Results**: A poor primary pregnancy outcome was encountered in 64.8% of the study group and 22.2% of the control group. Predictors of unfavorable primary pregnancy outcomes included older age, use of a short protocol, and shorter than anticipated crown-rump length. No difference was found in th

### Prediction of miscarriage in first trimester by serum estradiol, progesterone and β-human chorionic gonadotropin within 9 weeks of gestation [^111mnF8b]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Low credibility.

Although ultrasound and continuous blood HCG values can, to a certain extent, determine the risk of miscarriage, it is still necessary to predict high-risk pregnancy before clinical symptoms with other biomarkers. Estrogen and progesterone, which reflect the final pregnancy outcomes, have been recognized; however, few studies have indicated the specific hormone testing times and levels significant for predicting miscarriage.

In this study, we found that miscarriage in the first trimester may be predicted by estradiol levels, with higher threshold sensitivity of the cutoff value at 7–9 weeks of gestation. Our study had a limited number of cases, and more extensive case and multicenter studies need to be conducted.

Conclusively, low serum levels, such as dual estradiol and progesterone or estradiol alone at 7–9 weeks of gestation, can be used to better predict miscarriage in the first trimester. β-HCG or progesterone combined with estradiol at 5–6 weeks of gestation may also serve as better predictors.

### Surveillance without chemotherapy in a woman with recurrent molar pregnancy [^1141nsNM]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Low credibility.

A 27-year-old, fourth gravida patient with two previous partial molar pregnancies and one missed abortion underwent a suction evacuation for a partial molar pregnancy at 9 weeks of gestation. She was followed up with serum HCG values. Although the HCG level reduced from a pre-evacuation value of 140,223 mIU/ml to 31,157 mIU/ml one week post-procedure, the levels continued to be positive in low titres 6 months after the suction evacuation. Management options were discussed with the patient, and a decision was made to continue surveillance with serial HCG titres. HCG levels normalized after 11 months without the need for chemotherapy.

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 191: Tubal ectopic pregnancy [^115TWAXW]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for ectopic pregnancy, specifically with respect to serum hCG levels, the ACOG 2018 guidelines recommend not to rely solely on serum hCG values for the diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy. Instead, these values should be correlated with the patient's history, symptoms, and ultrasound findings.

### Very elevated hCGβ (≥ 10 multiple of the median) in maternal marker screening for Down syndrome: Frequency, etiologies, outcomes, and guidelines [^117EWtMo]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2024). High credibility.

This study aimed to detail maternal and fetal anomalies observed on a national scale in a large French cohort of patients presenting high hCG values (≥ 10 multiple of the median [MoM]) at Down syndrome screening in order to define clear and optimal guidelines.

- **Methods**: This retrospective multicenter study was based on a French annual database of all trisomy 21 screenings. Our study targeted and analyzed cases with hCG or hCGβ values ≥ 10 MoM, including complementary exams and outcomes.

- **Results**: The calculated frequency was 0.05% for hCGβ ≥ 10 MoM in unselected patients. For this series of 289 cases, a complication of the pregnancy or a poor outcome was observed in 145 cases (51%) as follows: 96 (66%) cases of fetal disease, 23 (16%) of maternal disease, 5 (3.5%) of placental anomalies, and 21 (14.5%) of systemic disease concerning mother, fetus, and placenta.

- **Conclusion**: This study establishes the frequency of hCG or hCGβ values ≥ 10 MoM, presents a flow chart that optimizes follow-up, and gives clear information for patients presenting such abnormal values at trisomy 21 screening.

### Diagnosis and management of ectopic pregnancy: Green-top guideline no. 21 [^115xUqsL]. BJOG (2016). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for ectopic pregnancy, specifically concerning serum hCG levels, the RCOG 2016 guidelines recommend obtaining a single serum β-human chorionic gonadotrophin measurement at the time of diagnosis in patients with suspected cervical pregnancy.

### Persistent low levels of beta-hCG in a patient with recurrent pregnancy loss [^114mn2VT]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2009). Low credibility.

A subset of women with persistent low levels of beta-hCG have undergone potentially harmful treatments despite no evidence of pregnancy or gestational trophoblastic neoplasia.

- **Case**: A 37-year-old woman with a history of recurrent pregnancy loss presented with persistent low levels of beta-hCG. She was treated for ectopic pregnancy and retained products and was later suspected of having a malignancy. However, further evaluation of her human chorionic gonadotropin led to a diagnosis of quiescent gestational trophoblastic disease.

- **Conclusion**: A diagnosis of quiescent gestational trophoblastic disease should be considered in all patients who present with persistent low levels of beta-hCG, including those with recurrent pregnancy loss.

### Prediction of miscarriage in first trimester by serum estradiol, progesterone and β-human chorionic gonadotropin within 9 weeks of gestation [^1142U4Um]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Low credibility.

- **Figures and findings**:
	- Fig. 2 shows estradiol receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves at 5–6 weeks and 7–9 weeks of gestation. The cutoff value, sensitivity, and specificity degrees are illustrated.
	- Fig. 3 presents progesterone ROC curves at the same gestational periods. The cutoff, sensitivity, and specificity degrees are covered.

- **Cutoff values and diagnostic accuracy**:
	- At 5–6 weeks, according to the Youden index of 0.374, the cutoff value of serum estradiol was 320 pg/ml with a sensitivity of 0.800, specificity of 0.574, and missed diagnosis rate of 0.426. By 7–9 weeks, the progesterone cutoff value was 15.27 ng/ml to a Youden index of 0.479, showing a sensitivity of 0.921, specificity of 0.558, and a missed diagnosis rate of 0.442.

- **Comparative diagnostic performance**:
	- Estradiol levels at both timeframes and progesterone levels at 7–9 weeks showed moderate agreement with ultrasound in diagnosing miscarriage (κ = 0.425, 0.419, and 0.599, P = 0.000 respectively).

- **Additional findings**:
	- At 5–6 weeks, the area under the curve (AUC) of serum progesterone was 0.529, indicating no statistical significance in predicting miscarriage during the first trimester (P = 0.572). Similarly, the AUCs for serum β-HCG at 5–6 and 7–9 weeks were 0.396 and 0.661, respectively, with no statistical significance (P = 0.059 for both).

### Human chorionic gonadotropin and plasma protein-A in alpha0-thalassemia pregnancies [^111kJAEE]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2006). Low credibility.

Maternal serum free beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-hCG) and pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A (PAPP-A) have been used effectively in the screening of Down syndrome in the first trimester. In this study, we aim to measure the value of first-trimester maternal serum free beta-hCG and PAPP-A as predictors of homozygous alpha0-thalassemia-affected pregnancies.

- **Methods**: Free beta-hCG and PAPP-A concentrations were measured in stored maternal serum samples obtained at 12 weeks of gestation from 22 women with fetuses affected by homozygous alpha0-thalassemia and from 436 controls matched for maternal age, ethnicity, and weight, as well as gestation at blood sampling.

- **Results**: Maternal serum concentration of free beta-hCG was significantly increased in women with pregnancies affected by homozygous alpha0-thalassemia compared to controls (P = .001). Concentrations of PAPP-A did not differ between the cases affected by homozygous alpha0-thalassemia and the controls (P = .652).

- **Conclusion**: Pregnancies affected by homozygous alpha0-thalassemia are associated with increased maternal serum free beta-hCG at 11–14 weeks of gestation. This serum analyte alone may not be clinically useful as a predictor of pregnancies affected by homozygous alpha0-thalassemia. However, the absence of ultrasound features of fetal anemia and hydropic changes, together with normal maternal serum free beta-hCG and PAPP-A in the first trimester, will be reassuring signs of normality for fetuses at risk of homozygous alpha0-thalassemia and may enable women to avoid invasive tests.

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 191: Tubal ectopic pregnancy [^1141uRdj]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for ectopic pregnancy, specifically concerning serum hCG levels, the ACOG 2018 guidelines recommend using the conservatively high value (such as high as 3,500 mIU/mL) when the hCG discriminatory level is used as a diagnostic aid in patients at risk of ectopic pregnancy. This approach is advised to avoid the potential misdiagnosis and possible interruption of an intrauterine pregnancy that the patient hopes to continue.

### Following declining human chorionic gonadotropin values in pregnancies of unknown location: When is it safe to stop [^113pdDKq]. Fertility and Sterility (2016). Low credibility.

To determine if the pattern of decline in hCG curves can discriminate between spontaneous abortion (SAB) and ectopic pregnancy (EP), a retrospective cohort study was conducted at university hospitals. The study involved 1,551 women with symptomatic pregnancy of unknown location (PUL) and decreasing hCG values.

Of these women, 146 were ultimately diagnosed with EP and 1,405 with SAB. An 85% hCG drop within 4 days or a 95% hCG drop within 7 days ruled out an EP 100% of the time. Applying the 4-day cutoff saved 16% of the SAB population (229/1,405) a total of 2,841 person-days and 277 clinical visits. Using the 7-day cutoff saved 9% of the SAB population (126/1,405) a total of 1,294 person-days and 182 clinical visits. These cutoffs were separately validated on a group of 179 EPs collected from three university clinical centers, where each cutoff ruled out EP 100% of the time.

The decline in serum hCG is slower in EPs than in SAB, which can aid clinicians in determining the frequency and duration of follow-up. Costs and patient time may be saved by allowing women who meet these criteria to be followed less frequently.

### Temporal refinement does not affect predicted human chorionic gonadotropin rise in early pregnancy [^115ctQTs]. Fertility and Sterility (2016). Low credibility.

To examine the impact of validation and temporal resolution on the estimation of hCG increase, this study was conducted because patients' hCG values are not obtained at precise daily increments or always in the same laboratory.

- **Design**: Retrospective cohort study of women presenting with nondiagnosed symptomatic first-trimester pregnancies who had serial hCG level measurements over time.

- **Setting**: Not applicable.

- **Patients**: A total of 171 women presented from September 2007 to February 2010 with first-trimester pregnancy pain and/or bleeding for whom a normal intrauterine pregnancy was ultimately confirmed.

- **Interventions**: None.

- **Main outcome measures**: Serial hCG values, time period between hCG measurements, hCG rise.

- **Results**: After data verification, 118 subjects contributing 327 values met inclusion criteria and passed data verification for analysis with improved temporal precision. The more precise data showed a steeper hCG rise, and the predicted 2-day hCG increase at the 1st percentile was slightly faster (1.68-fold vs. 1.56-fold) than the "raw" clinical data and previous models.

- **Conclusions**: Data verification and improved temporal precision suggested a faster hCG increase in early intrauterine gestation than previously demonstrated. Because laboratory variation and temporal imprecision are common, these data demonstrate that modeling of the expected rise of hCG in a normal gestation is valid and appropriately conservative in the determination of a nonviable gestation. No change in the minimal threshold for potential viability is recommended.

### Prediction of miscarriage in first trimester by serum estradiol, progesterone and β-human chorionic gonadotropin within 9 weeks of gestation [^114aSoqa]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Low credibility.

Pregnancy loss occurs in approximately 15–25% of pregnancies and remains the most common pregnancy complication, affecting women's physical and mental health. Repeated clinical examinations and treatments for threatened abortion also lead to economic and mental burdens on patients. However, there is no reliable clinical indicator to predict it early yet. Low values and low growth rates of estradiol and β-human chorionic gonadotropin (β-HCG) probably indicate a poor pregnancy outcome.

HCG, one of the most important endocrine factors, can inhibit T cell stimulation and prevent variant stimulation of T lymphocyte reaction, which might cause embryo damage. Initial HCG levels, HCG ratio, and low rising speed of HCG in early pregnancy may indicate miscarriage or ectopic pregnancy. Recent research suggests that serum progesterone, estradiol, and ultrasound can identify women with miscarriage. However, one study suggests that the most commonly used biomarkers, serum HCG and progesterone, are not useful in predicting the outcome of a pregnancy with a viable fetus. The factors that predict pregnancy losses are not well understood. Although both ultrasound and serial HCG values can, to some extent in the clinic, identify women at risk of miscarriage, research remains sparse on other more effective biomarkers to identify at-risk pregnancies, especially before the onset of clinical symptoms.

Estrogen stimulates endometrial hyperplasia and myometrium thickness, increases blood supply, and enhances uterine contraction force. Studies suggest that estradiol is an important factor in maintaining early pregnancy viability.

### First-trimester Down syndrome screening: Component analytes and timing for optimal performance [^113vF5ai]. Seminars in Perinatology (2005). Low credibility.

The most effective first-trimester Down syndrome screening protocol in use employs three independent markers: maternal serum levels of PAPP-A and free beta hCG, and measurement of fetal nuchal translucency (NT). Eleven weeks appears to be the optimum gestational age for performing first trimester DS risk assessment. Although the discrimination of free beta hCG improves with increasing gestational age and is greatest at 13 weeks, PAPP-A and NT perform optimally at 10 and 11 weeks, respectively.

In addition to accurate pregnancy dating, first trimester screening performance is improved by using a consistent NT measurement technique, NT cut-offs adjusted for gestational age or crown-rump length, and possibly center- or operator-specific NT medians. Whether or not the absence or presence of the nasal bone adds to screening accuracy is a matter of some debate. Finally, because enlarged NT has been associated with cardiac defects and other structural anomalies, even in euploid fetuses, its presence should prompt a targeted second trimester ultrasound examination.

### Study of first-trimester serum levels of β-hCG and PAPP-A as a screening test for fetal development of intrauterine growth restriction [^114ySinB]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Low credibility.

This study provides strong evidence that low first-trimester PAPP-A levels are independently associated with an increased risk of intrauterine growth restriction, reinforcing their value as early biomarkers of placental dysfunction. Although the association with β-hCG was less consistent, it remains clinically relevant and may complement PAPP-A in early risk stratification. Together, these markers could enhance screening strategies by identifying at-risk pregnancies earlier in gestation, enabling tailored follow-up and timely interventions to improve perinatal outcomes.

### Beta-human chorionic gonadotropin in cervicovaginal secretions and preterm delivery [^111C6tTg]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2004). Low credibility.

The study aimed to determine whether concentrations of beta-HCG in cervicovaginal secretions could predict spontaneous preterm birth (SPB) in asymptomatic high-risk pregnancies.

- **Methods**: A cohort study was conducted with cervicovaginal samples collected from 540 pregnant women between 20 to 28 weeks of gestation. The levels of beta-HCG were measured using an ELISA test.

- **Results**: There was a 3.2-fold increase in cervicovaginal beta-HCG concentrations among patients with SPB compared to those with term delivery. A single cervicovaginal beta-HCG level greater than 77.8 mIU/ml, measured between 20 and 28 weeks' gestation, identified patients with subsequent SPB as opposed to term delivery with a sensitivity of 87.5% (95% CI: 47.4–97.9) and a specificity of 97% (95% CI: 86.5–99.4). The positive and negative predictive values were 88.5% and 98%, respectively. Multiple logistic regression indicated that a cervicovaginal beta-HCG level greater than 77.8 mIU/ml was an independent predictor of SPB, with an adjusted odds ratio of 19.97 (95% CI: 10.65–37.45).

Conclusions drawn from the study suggest that cervicovaginal beta-HCG is a sensitive and specific predictor of patients with a subsequent preterm delivery.

### Using a decline in serum hCG between days 0–4 to predict ectopic pregnancy treatment success after single-dose methotrexate: a retrospective cohort study [^1148iakt]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2013). Low credibility.

Ectopic pregnancies occur in 1–2% of pregnancies. Although potentially life-threatening, the ability to non-invasively detect ectopic pregnancies before they rupture with ultrasound affords some women the option of medical management. Stovall et al. first demonstrated the safety and efficacy of outpatient methotrexate to treat women with ectopic pregnancies in 1989, and today approximately 25–30% of women presenting with this condition are eligible for such treatment.

Quantification of serum hCG provides a sensitive biomarker of viable trophoblastic tissue and is used in the medical treatment of ectopic pregnancy to monitor treatment response. In the single-dose methotrexate protocol developed by Stovall et al, treatment efficacy is determined by a ≥ 15% fall in serum hCG between days 4 and 7 of treatment; if there has been an insufficient fall in serum hCG at this time, further doses of methotrexate and/or surgery are indicated. This measure has been validated by Kirk et al. and shown to have a positive predictive value of 93% for treatment success. By definition, however, the first indication of treatment efficacy can be ascertained no earlier than day 7.

In 2010, Nguyen et al. reported that a fall in serum hCG between days 0–4 after methotrexate injection predicted treatment success with no further intervention in, remarkably, 100% of cases (n = 30). Investigating a cohort of 45 women in a follow-up study, we reported that a fall in serum hCG between days 0–4 predicted treatment success after single-dose methotrexate in 88% of cases. Furthermore, an earlier s

### Accuracy of serum beta-human chorionic gonadotropin cutoff values at 42 and 49 days' gestation [^112WPj65]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2001). Low credibility.

The accuracy of serum beta-human chorionic gonadotropin levels as cutoff values for estimating gestational age was studied.

- **Material and methods**: A database was created using information from previously performed research studies, which allowed entry of women both less than and greater than 49 days' gestation, involving medical abortion. Serum beta-human chorionic gonadotropin determinations and vaginal ultrasonography were performed in all studies before treatment. A total of 574 women had data available for analysis. A receiver operating characteristic curve was created to evaluate the predictive value of potential beta-human chorionic gonadotropin cutoff values for 42 and 49 days' gestation.

- **Results**: Appropriate serum beta-human chorionic gonadotropin cutoff values for 42 and 49 days' gestation were 23,745 mIU/mL (sensitivity, 96%; specificity, 91%; positive predictive value, 68%; negative predictive value, 99%) and 71,160 mIU/mL (sensitivity, 95%; specificity, 62%; positive predictive value, 76%; negative predictive value, 91%), respectively. Under 42 days' gestation, the serum beta-human chorionic gonadotropin-time relationship appears to be linear, with a greater diversity of individual values after 42 days.

- **Conclusion**: Serum beta-human chorionic gonadotropin values can be used with reasonable accuracy to screen for a gestational age up to 49 days' gestation.

### Diagnosis and management of ectopic pregnancy: Green-top guideline no. 21 [^116mPbiN]. BJOG (2016). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for ectopic pregnancy, and more specifically with respect to serum hCG levels, the RCOG 2016 guidelines indicate that there is insufficient evidence to support the use of serum β-human chorionic gonadotrophin for the diagnosis of heterotopic pregnancy.

### Prediction of miscarriage in first trimester by serum estradiol, progesterone and β-human chorionic gonadotropin within 9 weeks of gestation [^111y5YAX]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Low credibility.

Our results were similar to other studies that found low values and low growth rates of estradiol and β-HCG probably indicate poor pregnancy outcomes. However, another report revealed higher, not lower, levels of β-HCG and estrogen during the first 6 weeks of pregnancy, suggesting a novel association between β-HCG, estrogen, and threatened abortion. Unfortunately, this study was limited by its small sample size, unconvincing trial design, and inadequate exploration of the underlying mechanisms.

Early miscarriage is usually diagnosed with pelvic ultrasound following a woman experiences vaginal bleeding or abdominal pains. If the ultrasound at 8.5 weeks of pregnancy shows embryonic survival, 95% of pregnancies within 14 weeks would not end in miscarriage. Findings were controversial, although some studies on ultrasound scans, including subchorionic hemorrhage, fetal heart rate, crown–rump length, and yolk sac diameter, were associated with pregnancy loss. Thus, prediction markers before 8.5 weeks need further inspection. It was found in our study that estradiol at 5–9 weeks of gestation plays a key role in predicting miscarriage in the first trimester.

Findings differ from a previous study, which showed the values of estradiol at every gestational week from 5 to 8 weeks to predict miscarriage. There are two reasons for the 5–6 weeks and 7–9 weeks groups used in our study.

- **Prenatal clinic examination period**: Generally, an ultrasound scan may show the fetal sac at 5–6 weeks of gestation. More women are willing to come to the hospital during this period.

### Hyperglycosylated-hCG (h-hCG) and Down syndrome screening in the first and second trimesters of pregnancy [^115sEQve]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2007). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to validate Down syndrome screening protocols that include hyperglycosylated-hCG (h-hCG) measurements. The methods involved measuring h-hCG in 21,641 fresh first- and second-trimester maternal serum samples, though not for clinical interpretation. In the first trimester, nuchal translucency (NT) and pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A (PAPP-A) measurements were available. The second trimester included measurements of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), unconjugated estriol (uE3), and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG).

The results showed that of the 23 first-trimester and 26 second-trimester Down syndrome pregnancies identified, 52% and 65% of h-hCG measurements were above the 95th centile, respectively. At a 3% false positive rate, maternal age, NT, PAPP-A, and h-hCG detected 78% of cases (95% CI, 56–93%). Other combinations were consistent with previous modeling utilizing stored samples. A literature summary indicates h-hCG is as strong a marker as free beta between 10 and 13 weeks of gestation.

The conclusions suggest that the Down syndrome screening performance of h-hCG using fresh samples meets published expectations based on stored samples. h-hCG could potentially replace free beta measurements at gestational ages as early as 10 weeks.

### First trimester bleeding: Evaluation and management [^116zyq8f]. American Family Physician (2019). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for early pregnancy loss, more specifically with respect to ultrasound, AAFP 2019 guidelines recommend expecting to see a gestational sac on transvaginal ultrasound when β-hCG levels reach 1,500–3,000 mIU/mL.

### Study of first-trimester serum levels of β-hCG and PAPP-A as a screening test for fetal development of intrauterine growth restriction [^113muaRz]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Low credibility.

Neonatal outcomes are detailed in Table 2. Apgar scores at 5 minutes were significantly lower in the IUGR group (9.36 ± 1.28 vs. 9.60 ± 0.90, p = 0.022). No significant differences were found in Apgar scores at 1 minute (p = 0.126) or in umbilical cord pH (p = 0.424).

- **Table 2**
Neonatal outcomes in pregnancies with intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and reference group

Note: Statistically significant values are indicated with ** (p < 0.05). Data are presented as mean (standard deviation) for continuous variables or number (percentage) for categorical variables.

Birth complications include the following adverse perinatal events:

- **Fetal well-being loss**: Defined as abnormal fetal heart rate patterns or signs of distress requiring intervention.
- **Premature birth**: Defined as delivery before 37 weeks of gestation.
- **Placental abruption**: Defined as premature separation of the placenta from the uterine wall, potentially leading to fetal hypoxia or maternal hemorrhage.
- **Perinatal death**: Referring to fetal or neonatal death occurring around the time of birth.
- **Neonatal hospitalization**: Defined as admission to a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) due to complications requiring specialized care.

Overall, neonatal complications were more prevalent in IUGR pregnancies, with only 54.62% of these cases presenting without any complication, compared to 88.51% in the reference group (p < 0.001). Fetal well-being loss was more frequent among IUGR cases (12.61% vs. 3.39%, p < 0.001), as were perinatal death (4.20% vs. 0.78%, p = 0.009) and neonatal hospitalization (25.21% vs. 6.53%, p < 0.001).

### Beta-human chorionic gonadotropin and prolactin assays in cervicovaginal secretions as a predictor of preterm delivery [^113YxjK2]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2001). Low credibility.

To evaluate and compare the predictive value of cervicovaginal beta-hCG and prolactin levels in spontaneous preterm delivery, researchers conducted a study with two groups: the preterm labor group and the normal pregnancy group. These groups consisted of 17 and 43 patients between 24 and 36 weeks' gestation, respectively. A single cervicovaginal beta-hCG and prolactin measurement was made in both groups.

Cervicovaginal beta-hCG and prolactin levels were significantly higher in the preterm group compared to the term delivery group (P = 0.031, P = 0.026, respectively). The optimal cut-off value for beta-hCG (27.1 mIU/ml) provided a sensitivity level of 87.5% (47.4–97.9; 95% C. I.) at a specificity of 65.4% (50.9–78.0; 95% C. I.), with positive and negative predictive values of 28% and 97%, respectively. For prolactin, the optimal cut-off value (1.8 ng/ml) indicated a sensitivity level of 50% (16.0–84.0; 95% C. I.) at a specificity of 96% (86.8–99.4; 95% C. I.), with positive and negative predictive values of 67% and 93%, respectively.

In conclusion, cervicovaginal beta-hCG measurement in patients with preterm labor may be used as a predictive test, whereas cervicovaginal prolactin is not a sensitive test compared to the beta-hCG test.

### Study of first-trimester serum levels of β-hCG and PAPP-A as a screening test for fetal development of intrauterine growth restriction [^112gHBCp]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Low credibility.

Although our findings support the use of PAPP-A and β-hCG for early risk stratification of IUGR, it is important to highlight that international clinical guidelines do not incorporate these biomarkers into formal screening protocols for intrauterine growth restriction. The 2019 FIGO recommendations suggest that PAPP-A may be included in preeclampsia risk models when already available from aneuploidy screening but do not propose its use for IUGR prediction. Similarly, the 2024 update of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists' Green-top Guideline No. 31 provides detailed recommendations for IUGR monitoring based on Doppler assessments and clinical factors, yet does not include first-trimester biochemical markers in its risk pathways. Moreover, the ISUOG guidelines for first-trimester ultrasound performance do not address the use of PAPP-A or β-hCG in screening for fetal growth restriction. This absence underscores a significant translational gap that our study seeks to address through a cost-effective, real-world model based on existing screening infrastructure.

### Study of first-trimester serum levels of β-hCG and PAPP-A as a screening test for fetal development of intrauterine growth restriction [^112pBSY1]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the association between first-trimester serum levels of pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A (PAPP-A) and free beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG) with the development of intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). The purpose was to assess their utility in early screening for improved perinatal outcomes.

- **Methods**: A retrospective case-cohort study was conducted at Marqués de Valdecilla University Hospital in 2021, including 119 pregnancies with IUGR and a randomly selected subcohort of 383 pregnancies from the same population. Serum levels of PAPP-A and β-hCG were analyzed both as continuous variables and as categorical variables based on population-specific percentiles (< 10th and < 5th). Logistic regression models were used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), adjusting for relevant maternal and obstetric covariates.

- **Results**: Lower PAPP-A levels were significantly associated with an increased risk of IUGR, both as a continuous variable (OR = 0.50; 95% CI: 0.34–0.76, p = 0.001) and when categorized below the 10th percentile (OR = 4.01; 95% CI: 1.78–9.01, p < 0.001) and 5th percentile (OR = 4.45; 95% CI: 1.57–12.63, p = 0.005). β-hCG showed no association when analyzed continuously (p = 0.164), but values below the 10th percentile were significantly associated with IUGR (OR = 4.45; 95% CI: 1.97–10.04, p < 0.001). No reliable estimate could be obtained at the 5th percentile due to the small number of cases.

- **Conclusion**: Incorporating PAPP-A and β-hCG into first-trimester screening protocols could enable earlier identification of pregnancies at risk.

### Symptomatic patients with an early viable intrauterine pregnancy: HCG curves redefined [^113g2mHW]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2004). Low credibility.

To analyze the change in serial human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) levels in women symptomatic with pain or bleeding who presented with nondiagnostic ultrasonography but were ultimately confirmed to have a viable intrauterine pregnancy, the following methods were employed:

- **Methods**: The rise in serial hCG measures was modeled over time, with the start point defined in two ways: by last menstrual period and by date of presentation for care. Both semiparametric (spline) curves and linear random-effects models were explored. The slope and projected increase of hCG were calculated to define 99% of viable intrauterine pregnancies.

- **Results**: A total of 287 subjects met inclusion criteria and contributed 861 measurements of hCG. On average, these subjects contributed 3.00 observations and were followed up for 5.25 days. A linear increase in log hCG best described the pattern of rise. Curves derived from last menstrual period and day of presentation do not differ substantially. The median slope for a rise of hCG after 1 day was 1.50 (or a 50% increase); 2.24 after 2 days (or a 124% rise), and 5.00 after 4 days. The fastest rise was 1.81 at 1 day, 3.28 at 2 days, and 10.76 at 4 days. The slowest or minimal rise for a normal viable intrauterine pregnancy was 24% at 1 day and 53% at 2 days.

- **Conclusion**: These data define the slowest rise in serial hCG values for a potentially viable gestation and will aid in distinguishing a viable early pregnancy from a miscarriage or ectopic pregnancy. The minimal rise in serial hCG values for women with a viable intrauterine pregnancy is slower than previously reported.

### Occult abnormal pregnancies after first post-embryo transfer serum beta-human chorionic gonadotropin levels of 1.0–5.0 mIU/mL [^114LkDxb]. Fertility and Sterility (2016). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to assess the occult pregnancy rate after "negative" first post-embryo transfer (ET) serum β-hCG results. The research was designed as a two-part retrospective cohort study and nested case series. It was conducted in a university-based fertility center.

A total of 1,571 negative first post-ET serum β-hCG results were included in the study. The primary cohort, consisting of 1,326 results collected between June 2009 and December 2013, was initially reported as < 5 mIU/mL. The secondary cohort, comprising 245 results from January 2014 to March 2015, was reported as discrete values from 1.0 to 5.0 mIU/mL. No interventions were applied.

- **Main outcome measures**: Rates of occult pregnancy, ectopic pregnancy, and complications after negative first post-ET serum β-hCG results.

- **Results**: A total of 88.8% (1,178/1,326) of the negative first post-ET results reported as < 5 were actually < 1.0 mIU/mL. Occult pregnancy was incidentally identified in 1.2% (12/1,041) of subjects with follow-up. Six of these had ectopic pregnancies, and seven experienced serious complications. A total of 11 (91.7%) of the 12 occult pregnancies had a first post-ET serum β-hCG level of 1.0–5.0 mIU/mL, and 1 (8.3%) had a level < 1.0 mIU/mL. All pregnancies with serious complications had initial β-hCG levels of 1.0–5.0 mIU/mL.

Of the 245 results reported as discrete values, occult pregnancies were diagnosed in 5.5% (9/163) of subjects with follow-up. One subject had an ectopic pregnancy, which was treated with methotrexate. There were no serious complications in the secondary cohort.

- **Conclusion**: The majority of negative first post-ET serum β-hCG levels are < 1.0 mIU/mL. Results from 1.0 to 5.0 mIU/mL may fail to exclude an occult pregnancy.

### Qualitative beta-hCG urine assays may be misleading in the presence of molar pregnancy: a case report [^112wBFhC]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Molar pregnancy is a rare complication of pregnancy, and the diagnosis is usually confirmed with a markedly elevated beta-hCG and a "snowstorm" appearance on pelvic ultrasound. Patients frequently present with a positive pregnancy test, vaginal bleeding, nausea, and vomiting. A 23-year-old woman presented to our Emergency Department with a history of 7 weeks of intermittent vaginal bleeding and 1 hour of peri-umbilical abdominal pain. She reported that 7 weeks before this visit, she was diagnosed with a miscarriage. The bedside qualitative urine human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) test that we performed was negative, but the quantitative serum hCG was markedly elevated. Ultrasound and operative findings confirmed the diagnosis of molar pregnancy. We conclude that rapid urine qualitative hCG assays may not be reliable in the presence of markedly elevated hCG levels found in molar pregnancy.

### First trimester maternal serum PAPP-A and free β-hCG levels and risk of SGA or LGA in women with and without GDM [^116rKcx9]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Low credibility.

Free β-human chorionic gonadotropin (fβ-hCG) is produced by trophoblasts and is a pregnancy-specific hormone that regulates placental development, as well as uterine and fetal growth. Together with PAPP-A, fβ-hCG is measured from maternal serum in the first trimester as part of a combined screening program for chromosomal abnormalities. fβ-hCG values are increased in trisomy 21 pregnancies and decreased in trisomy 18 and 13 pregnancies. Low fβ-hCG concentration is associated with low birthweight, preterm birth, and low Apgar scores. Previous studies have reported contradictory results on the association between high MoM levels of fβ-hCG and SGA. High fβ-hCG MoM levels seemed to be a protective factor for GDM and preterm birth in previous studies.

First trimester maternal serum markers PAPP-A and fβ-hCG have been shown to be associated with several pregnancy complications that affect fetal weight. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of abnormal maternal serum biochemistry in fetal growth in GDM and non-GDM pregnancies. This is interesting as low PAPP-A is associated with the risk of SGA newborns, but also with the risk of GDM, which on the contrary is associated with LGA newborns. Our hypothesis in this study was that gestational diabetes would affect fetal growth more than abnormal first trimester biochemistry. Our primary aim was to determine whether low PAPP-A MoM in women with GDM is associated with an increased risk of SGA or LGA. We also investigated whether high PAPP-A MoM levels as such are associated with LGA. Furthermore, we examined the association.

### Guideline no. 408: Management of gestational trophoblastic diseases [^116yM7ye]. Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Canada (2021). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for gestational trophoblastic disease, and more specifically concerning serum hCG levels, the SOGC 2021 guidelines recommend considering obtaining serum or urine hCG for earlier diagnosis of GTD. This is particularly suggested if products of conception are not routinely sent for pathology and symptoms of pregnancy persist 4–6 weeks after the termination of pregnancy, evacuation of a nonviable pregnancy, or spontaneous abortion.

### First trimester bleeding: Evaluation and management [^1119Cf46]. American Family Physician (2019). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for early pregnancy loss, specifically concerning human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), the 2019 guidelines from the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) recommend considering the initial β-hCG level when monitoring the rate of β-hCG increase in early pregnancy. In viable intrauterine pregnancies with initial β-hCG levels of 3,000 mIU/mL, there is a 99% chance that the β-hCG level will increase by at least 49%, 40%, and 33% over 48 hours, respectively.

### First-trimester maternal serum PAPP-A and free-beta subunit human chorionic gonadotropin concentrations and nuchal translucency are associated with obstetric complications: A population-based screening study (the FASTER Trial) [^112xPYJ1]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2004). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to determine whether maternal serum levels of pregnancy-associated plasma protein A (PAPP-A), free-beta subunit human chorionic gonadotropin, or nuchal translucency size are associated with obstetric complications.

Data were obtained from the First and Second Trimester Evaluation of Risk trial. Pregnancy-associated plasma protein A and free-beta subunit human chorionic gonadotropin levels were analyzed, and nuchal translucency was measured between 10 weeks 3 days and 13 weeks 6 days of gestation in 34,271 pregnancies.

- **Results**: Women with pregnancy-associated plasma protein A at or above the 99th percentile and free-beta subunit human chorionic gonadotropin at or below the 1st percentile were associated with an increased risk of spontaneous loss at or below 24 weeks of gestation (adjusted odds ratios, 3.90, 3.62, respectively; P < .001).

- **Conclusion**: Low pregnancy-associated plasma protein A levels in the first trimester were strongly associated with a number of adverse pregnancy outcomes. Low free-beta subunit human chorionic gonadotropin levels and large nuchal translucency were both associated with early fetal loss.

### Study of first-trimester serum levels of β-hCG and PAPP-A as a screening test for fetal development of intrauterine growth restriction [^113C7yc7]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). High credibility.

Fetal intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) is a condition that develops in 20–30% of small-for-gestational-age fetuses during pregnancy. In Europe, it is estimated to affect up to 10% of pregnancies. IUGR is one of the major contributors to adverse perinatal outcomes and a significant risk factor for neonatal morbidity and mortality. Its pathophysiology primarily involves chronic vasoconstriction of the tertiary stem villi in the placenta, caused by inadequate trophoblastic invasion of the maternal spiral arteries. Currently, the most commonly used screening method begins with a second-trimester ultrasound (18–20 weeks) using Doppler studies of the maternal uterine arteries. Although the possibility of advancing screening to the first trimester has been explored, there is still insufficient evidence to support this change. Earlier screening could enable timely detection, closer monitoring, and the application of interventions earlier in pregnancy.

In clinical practice, risk calculators are available that incorporate the previously mentioned proteins along with other data. However, no population-based screening protocol for IUGR in the first trimester currently exists, highlighting the importance of this project.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate first-trimester serum levels of PAPP-A and β-hCG and their relationship with the development of intrauterine growth restriction over the course of pregnancy. Our findings may provide a foundation for establishing population-based IUGR screening in the first trimester, enabling earlier monitoring, prevention, and management.

### Serum human chorionic gonadotropin measurements may predict pregnancy outcome and multiple gestation after in vitro fertilization [^1149QBdq]. Fertility and Sterility (2002). Low credibility.

To predict pregnancy outcome and multiple gestation, a common parameter was used by which hCG values can be compared, independent of the day of blood sampling. This retrospective study was set in a university-based IVF program, involving 120 IVF pregnancies conceived between November 1995 and August 1999. No interventions were performed.

- **Main outcome measures**: Early pregnancy loss, including preclinical and first-trimester abortions and ectopic pregnancies, as well as ongoing pregnancies such as singleton and multiple deliveries and second-trimester abortions, were assessed. Day 11 hCG levels were calculated assuming an exponential increase of hCG values in early pregnancy. Receiver-operating characteristic analysis determined cut-off levels with the best sensitivity and specificity for predicting pregnancy outcomes.

Serum hCG levels in cases of early pregnancy loss were significantly lower than those in ongoing pregnancies. A cut-off level of 50 IU/L predicted pregnancy outcomes with a sensitivity of 75% and a specificity of 81%. An hCG value greater than 135 IU/L predicted multiple ongoing pregnancies with a sensitivity of 80% and specificity of 88%.

In conclusion, after IVF, early pregnancy loss or multiple gestation may be predicted with high sensitivity and specificity using cut-off values of serum hCG derived from two measurements, independent of the day of blood sampling.

### Postmenopausal pregnancy? Evaluation of elevated hCG in a 59-year-old woman [^115Cam8p]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

Slightly elevated serum human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) can be a normal finding in postmenopausal women. We report a case of a 59-year-old woman with a history of abnormal uterine bleeding who presented with a concern for pregnancy after developing nausea and vomiting a few weeks after unprotected intercourse. Although pregnancy was extremely unlikely, hCG was obtained to reassure the patient since she reported that her mother conceived at the age of 60. Serum hCG was positive, prompting concern for malignancy versus pregnancy. Stable serum hCG levels, elevated follicle-stimulating hormone, and a negative transvaginal ultrasound ruled out both malignancy and pregnancy. The positive serum pregnancy test and hCG elevation were attributed to the normal postmenopausal state.

### Prediction of miscarriage in first trimester by serum estradiol, progesterone and β-human chorionic gonadotropin within 9 weeks of gestation [^111x45rw]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Low credibility.

Levels of serum estradiol, progesterone, and β-HCG were analyzed in this study. The characteristics of the two groups are presented in Table 1. The groups were similar in terms of women's age, number of pregnancies, and parity. Only three women who experienced miscarriage consented to chromosomal karyotype testing of the embryos, and the results were normal.

Table 2 illustrates the progesterone levels before initiating oral dydrogesterone treatment in women at 5–6 weeks of gestation, comparing normal pregnancy and miscarriage groups. Progesterone levels were slightly higher in normal pregnancies without dydrogesterone compared to those preparing for oral dydrogesterone treatment. Table 3 shows blood measurements of progesterone before or after starting dydrogesterone treatment at 7–9 weeks of gestation in women with threatened abortion. It indicates that higher progesterone levels were observed with dydrogesterone treatment compared to without, although the differences were not statistically significant between groups.

The mean maternal age in miscarriage cases did not significantly differ (P > 0.05) from the normal pregnancy group at both 5–6 weeks and 7–9 weeks of gestation, as seen in Tables 4 and 5. Table 4 details age and serum levels of estradiol, progesterone, and β-HCG in both normal pregnancy and miscarriage groups at 5–6 weeks of gestation. It was noted that these measurements were significantly lower in the miscarriage group compared to the normal pregnancy group (P < 0.01).

### Maternal serum free beta-hCG and PAPP-A in patients with habitual abortion-influence on first-trimester screening for chromosomal abnormalities [^114CYRtm]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2007). Low credibility.

The objective was to explore if maternal serum free beta-hCG and pregnancy-associated plasma protein A (PAPP-A) levels in the first trimester of pregnancy are altered in patients with habitual abortions and if there is an effect on first-trimester screening for Down syndrome.

- **Methods**: A retrospective study was conducted on 913 normal singleton fetuses that underwent first-trimester combined screening for Down syndrome. Maternal serum PAPP-A and free beta-hCG were compared between patients with (n = 64) and without habitual abortions (n = 849).

- **Results**: The medians ± SD log(10) MoM of PAPP-A and free beta-hCG ± SD in patients with and without habitual abortions were 0.063 ± 0.28 versus -0.014 ± 0.27 and -0.001 ± 0.27 versus -0.018 ± 0.31, with a p value of 0.042 and 0.87, respectively. The screen positive rate setting the cutoff at 1:350, looking at the background risk for trisomy 21, was 71.4% in women with and 81.2% in women without habitual abortion. After combined first-trimester screening, it was 7.8% in women with and 10.1% in women without habitual abortion.

- **Conclusions**: Patients with habitual abortions have slightly increased maternal serum PAPP-A levels in the first trimester. This marginal difference seems not to affect risk calculation in combined first-trimester screening for trisomy 21.

### Guideline no. 408: Management of gestational trophoblastic diseases [^113nf3ki]. Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Canada (2021). High credibility.

Regarding the diagnostic investigations for gestational trophoblastic disease, more specifically with respect to serum hCG levels, the SOGC 2021 guidelines recommend obtaining serum hCG levels in female patients of reproductive age presenting with abnormal uterine bleeding, bleeding lasting more than six weeks following pregnancy, or evidence of metastatic disease. This is crucial to promptly diagnose and manage gestational trophoblastic disease.

### Second-trimester levels of pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A and free beta-hCG in pregnancies with trisomy 13 [^117M2MUJ]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2005). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to examine the levels of free beta-human chorionic gonadotrophin (free beta-hCG) and pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A (PAPP-A) in second-trimester maternal serum from pregnancies affected by trisomy 13. The goal was to compare these levels with the known reduced levels of these markers in first-trimester cases to better understand the pathophysiology of changes in marker levels in chromosomally abnormal pregnancies between the first and second trimester.

- **Methods**: Using the Kryptor immunoassay system, we measured free beta-hCG and PAPP-A in 32 singleton pregnancies affected by trisomy 13 between 14 and 20 weeks of gestation. These results were compared against 450 normal singleton pregnancies over the same gestational range, using medians established in a previous study. The data were combined with data from 82 cases of trisomy 13 previously examined in the first trimester (11–13 weeks), and an analysis of analyte trend was performed.

- **Results**: The median free beta-hCG in multiples of the appropriate gestational median (MoM) in the second-trimester samples was not significantly different from the controls (1.15 (95% CI 0.827–1.651) vs 1.00). However, the median PAPP-A MoM in the second-trimester samples was significantly lower (p < 0.001) than in controls (0.25 (95% CI 0.164–0.373) vs 1.00). Seventy-eight percent of cases were below the 5th centile of normal for PAPP-A. The combined cases in the first trimester had a median free beta-hCG MoM of 0.58 (95% CI 0.454–0.668) and a median PAPP-A MoM of 0.26 (95% CI 0.218–0.320). For PAPP-A, there was no significant change in median.

### Gestational trophoblastic neoplasia after human chorionic gonadotropin normalization in a retrospective cohort of 7761 patients in France [^115dqtRc]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). Low credibility.

The risk of malignant transformation of molar pregnancies after human chorionic gonadotropin levels return to normal is low, roughly 0.4%, but may justify an adaptation of monitoring strategies for certain patients.

- **Objective**: This study aimed to determine the risk of gestational trophoblastic neoplasia after human chorionic gonadotropin normalization in women with molar pregnancy and to identify risk factors for this type of malignant transformation, in order to optimize follow-up protocols after human chorionic gonadotropin normalization.

- **Study design**: This was a retrospective observational national cohort study based at the French National Center for Trophoblastic Diseases of 7761 patients, treated between 1999 and 2020 for gestational trophoblastic disease, whose human chorionic gonadotropin levels returned spontaneously to normal.

- **Results**: Among 7761 patients whose human chorionic gonadotropin levels returned to normal, 20 (0.26%) developed gestational trophoblastic neoplasia. The risk of malignant transformation varied with the type of mole, from 0% (0 of 2592 cases) for histologically proven partial mole to 0.36% for complete mole (18 of 5045) and 2.1% (2 of 95) for twin molar pregnancy. The median time to diagnosis of malignant transformation after human chorionic gonadotropin normalization was 11.4 months (range, 1–34 months). At diagnosis, 16 of 20 patients (80%) had the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage I tumor, and 10 of 20 patients (50%) had a tumor classified as low risk in terms of the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics.

### Second-trimester maternal serum free-beta-human chorionic gonadotropin and alpha-fetoprotein levels in normal twin and singleton pregnancies: A report of local Chinese population [^115Nrk73]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2008). Low credibility.

The study evaluated the differences between Chinese normal twin and singleton pregnancies in the levels of maternal serum free-beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (free beta-hCG) and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) used in second-trimester Down syndrome (DS) screening.

- **Methods**: The concentrations of maternal serum markers of 456 twin pregnancies and 12,067 singleton controls at gestational weeks 15 to 20 were measured by time-resolved fluoroimmunoassay. The levels of markers were compared between the twins and singletons.

- **Results**: Significant differences were found between the levels of free beta-hCG in twins and those in singletons at gestational weeks 16, 17, and 19 (p < 0.05). For 15 to 18 and 20 gestational weeks, no significant differences were observed (p > 0.05 for AFP from 16 to 20 gestational weeks).

- **Conclusions**: The Chinese gestational age-specific levels of maternal serum markers in normal twins are not twice those in singletons. The weight-correction model for DS screening may not be feasible for twins.

### Monitoring complete hydatidiform molar pregnancies after normalisation of human chorionic gonadotrophin: National retrospective population study [^111UML12]. BMJ Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

We have previously shown that the risk of gestational trophoblastic neoplasia after hCG levels return to normal in patients with a partial hydatidiform mole is low (0.03%, n = 3 of 9586 patients) and therefore, we recommended one confirmatory normal value before stopping hCG monitoring. In contrast, for a complete hydatidiform mole, we noted a slightly higher risk of post-molar gestational trophoblastic neoplasia after hCG levels had returned to normal (0.24%, n = 20 of 8400 patients), which decreased from one in 839 (0.12%) patients at four months to one in 1677 (0.06%) patients at 12 months after the first normal hCG value.

In keeping with previous data, patients with a complete hydatidiform mole who achieved normalisation of hCG levels in less than 56 days had a significantly lower risk of gestational trophoblastic neoplasia than those with normal levels in 56 days or more (one in 1159 (0.09%) versus one in 308 (0.32%) patients, odds ratio 0.27, 95% confidence interval 0.08 to 0.88, P = 0.03). Consequently, patients with a complete hydatidiform mole seemed to need longer monitoring if hCG levels returned to normal in 56 days or more from the date of uterine evacuation. In the UK, hCG monitoring is continued for six more months after the first normal hCG value in these patients, whereas those with normal hCG levels in less than 56 days are monitored for only six months from the date of molar evacuation. Globally, many other centres monitor patients with a complete hydatidiform mole for several months following a normal hCG level.

### Beta-human chorionic gonadotropin levels and the likelihood of ectopic pregnancy in emergency department patients with abdominal pain or vaginal bleeding [^114xv27n]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Strategies for diagnosing ectopic pregnancy that defer endovaginal ultrasound in women with suggestive symptoms and serum beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-hCG) levels less than 1500 mIU/mL ignore the increased risk of ectopic pregnancy in these patients.

- **Objective**: To quantify this increased risk by establishing and comparing the beta-hCG distributions of symptomatic women with ectopic pregnancies, abnormal intrauterine pregnancies, and normal intrauterine pregnancies.

- **Methods**: The authors reviewed the records of a cohort of women who visited an urban emergency department (ED) during a 34-month period with abdominal pain or vaginal bleeding and non-zero quantitative beta-hCG levels. Explicit criteria were used to determine whether the pregnancy ultimately turned out to be intrauterine and normal, intrauterine and abnormal, or ectopic. Probability distributions were compared using frequency distributions, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, and likelihood ratios.

- **Results**: Of 730 ED patients included in the analysis, 96 (13%) had ectopic pregnancies, 253 (35%) had abnormal intrauterine pregnancies, and 381 (52%) had normal intrauterine pregnancies. The beta-hCG distributions of patients with ectopic pregnancies and abnormal intrauterine pregnancies were similar and much lower than the beta-hCG distribution of patients with normal intrauterine pregnancies. A beta-hCG level less than 1500 mIU/mL more than doubled the odds of ectopic pregnancy (likelihood ratio = 2.24). Of the 158 patients with beta-hCG below 1500 mIU/mL, 40 (25%; 95% confidence interval).

### Pathology consultation on human chorionic gonadotropin testing for pregnancy assessment [^117WL1B7]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2015). Low credibility.

To provide clarity on the use of qualitative and quantitative human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) tests for the assessment of pregnancy, a case scenario and a brief review of the relevant literature describe clinical and analytical considerations regarding hCG testing.

In pregnancy, hCG is nearly always detectable in serum and urine within 16 days after ovulation. Serial hCG testing is valuable in the evaluation of suspected ectopic pregnancy. hCG assays vary in their analytical specificity, and qualitative tests may be less analytically sensitive than claimed. Erroneous hCG test results can occur for several reasons. hCG assays are reliable diagnostic tests for pregnancy assessment, but a clear understanding of their limitations is necessary for appropriate result interpretation.

### Falsely elevated human chorionic gonadotropin leading to unnecessary therapy [^115mNjtN]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2001). Low credibility.

Analysis of serum beta-hCG aids diagnosis and treatment of intrauterine pregnancies, ectopic gestations, and gestational trophoblastic neoplasia. Beta-hCG concentrations are specific for trophoblastic tissue, thus they are rarely questioned.

- **Cases**: An 18-year-old nullipara experienced bleeding and had a positive beta-hCG. Ultrasound identified no pregnancy. She passed tissue and stopped bleeding. Serum beta-hCG remained elevated despite uterine curettage and three courses of methotrexate. The results of the urine beta-hCG were negative, as was the reference laboratory serum assay. A 31-year-old nullipara had a spontaneous abortion, but serum beta-hCG remained elevated. Uterine curettage found secretory endometrium, yet elevated serum beta-hCG persisted. Urine beta-hCG was negative, as was the reference laboratory serum assay.

- **Conclusion**: Patients with histories incongruent with serum beta-hCG findings should have urine beta-hCG analysis conducted.

### PAPP-A and free β-hCG measured prior to 10 weeks is associated with preterm delivery and small-for-gestational-age infants [^113H8Cui]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2011). Low credibility.

The objective of the study was to evaluate whether measuring pregnancy-associated plasma protein A (PAPP-A) and free β-human chorionic gonadotrophin (β-hCG) before 10 weeks of gestation affects the association between these biomarkers and adverse pregnancy outcomes.

- **Methods**: Singleton pregnant women, totaling 9,450, who attended the prenatal screening program at Aarhus University Hospital, Denmark, were included. Maternal serum levels of PAPP-A and free β-hCG were measured between 8 weeks and 13 weeks and 6 days. The risk of preterm delivery (< 37 weeks) and small-for-gestational-age (SGA) (less than the fifth centile) was evaluated in relation to PAPP-A and free β-hCG < 0.4 multiples of the median, stratified according to early (< 10 weeks) or late (≥ 10 weeks) biochemical testing.

- **Results**: A stronger association between low PAPP-A and SGA was found with early serum sampling compared to late, but the difference was not statistically significant [odds ratio (OR) 3.2 vs. 1.8; P-value = 0.11]. This difference did not apply to PAPP-A and preterm delivery. For free β-hCG, a stronger association with preterm delivery was found with early testing (OR 1.9 vs. 1.1; P-value = 0.31), whereas this difference was not found regarding SGA.

- **Conclusion**: Biochemical testing before 10 weeks does not affect the association between low PAPP-A and free β-hCG and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Whether the association is actually stronger with early testing requires further study.

### Performance of human chorionic gonadotropin curves in women at risk for ectopic pregnancy: Exceptions to the rules [^111aXdBs]. Fertility and Sterility (2012). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to investigate the accuracy of serial hCG in predicting the outcome of a pregnancy of unknown location in an ethnically and geographically diverse setting. The research was designed as a multisite cohort study conducted in a university hospital setting, focusing on women with a pregnancy of unknown location. No specific interventions were applied during the study.

The main outcome measures involved following patients until a diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy (EP), intrauterine pregnancy (IUP), or miscarriage was established. To predict outcomes, the observed hCG levels were compared with recommended thresholds to assess any deviation from the defined normal curves. The predicted outcomes were then compared with the standard of care, calculating sensitivity, specificity, predictive value, and accuracy, stratified by diagnosis.

The results showed that, among 1,005 patients, 179 were diagnosed with EP, 259 with IUP, and 567 with miscarriages. The optimal balance of sensitivity and specificity was achieved using a minimal expected 2-day increase in hCG level of 35% and a minimal 2-day decrease of 36%-47%, depending on the level, resulting in 83.2% sensitivity and 70.8% specificity for predicting EP. However, solely using serial hCG levels would misclassify 16.8% of EPs and 7.7% of IUPs. Incorporating a third hCG measurement and early ultrasound reduced IUP misclassification to 2.7%.

The conclusion drawn was that relying solely on serial hCG values can lead to misclassification. Clinical judgment should take precedence over prediction rules, and continued monitoring with a third hCG may be necessary, particularly when initial values are low or near the suggested thresholds.

### First trimester maternal serum PAPP-A and free β-hCG levels and risk of SGA or LGA in women with and without GDM [^111VQRZo]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Low credibility.

Maternal age was defined as the mother's age at the first antenatal visit. Maternal body mass index (BMI) was calculated as the mother's pre-pregnancy weight divided by the square of her height (kg/m²). Any smoking occurring during the pregnancy was defined as smoking. Data were obtained from screening data and MBR.

The 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was routinely performed in all pregnancies between the 24th and 28th gestational weeks (gw). However, exceptions were made for primiparas under 25 years of age with normal weight (BMI 18.5–24.9 kg/m²) and no family history of type 2 diabetes, as well as multiparas under 40 years of age with normal weight (BMI under 25 kg/m²) and no previous instances of GDM or LGA babies. In high-risk populations (BMI ≥ 35 kg/m², prior GDM, family history of type 2 diabetes, polycystic ovary syndrome, glucosuria in early pregnancy, oral corticosteroid medication), OGTT was performed already between the 12th and 16th gw. If the early OGTT was normal, it was re-tested between the 24th and 28th gw. The test was considered abnormal if glucose concentrations in OGTT were in venous plasma following a 12-hour overnight fast ≥ 5.3 mmol/l, at 1 hour ≥ 10.0 mmol/l, and 2 hours ≥ 8.6 mmol/l after the glucose load.

The diagnosis of GDM was set after one or several abnormal glucose concentrations. In the present study, the diagnosis of GDM was based on an abnormal OGTT result and/or ICD-10 codes O24.4 and/or O24.9 according to MBR. Every woman receives lifestyle counseling (weight gain, nutrition, physical exercise, and blood pressure recommendations) during pregnancy.

### Study of first-trimester serum levels of β-hCG and PAPP-A as a screening test for fetal development of intrauterine growth restriction [^114vV6EF]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Low credibility.

The biological role of PAPP-A helps explain this association. As a zinc-binding metalloproteinase, PAPP-A modulates IGF bioavailability, promoting trophoblastic invasion and adequate spiral artery remodeling — key processes for optimal placental vascularization and fetal growth. Insufficient PAPP-A levels impair IGF activation, leading to poor trophoblastic invasion, chronic vasoconstriction of tertiary stem villi, and reduced placental volume, ultimately contributing to fetal growth restriction.

Regarding β-hCG, our data suggest a more modest but still relevant role. While β-hCG levels did not show a significant association with IUGR when analyzed as a continuous variable (OR = 0.83; 95% CI: 0.63–1.08, p = 0.164), levels below the 10th percentile were significantly associated with an increased risk (OR = 4.45; 95% CI: 1.97–10.04, p < 0.001). This suggests a potential complementary utility of β-hCG in early screening. However, at the 5th percentile, no valid estimate could be derived due to the small number of cases. These findings are partially aligned with prior studies such as Dugoff et al. (2004) and Rodríguez-Zurita et al. (2021). Dugoff et al. (2004) found that β-hCG levels below the 1st percentile were associated with fetal growth restriction before 24 weeks. Likewise, Rodríguez-Zurita et al. (2021) and Yiming Chen et al. (2024) reported a correlation between low β-hCG levels and IUGR development. These associations may be explained by β-hCG's role in trophoblastic invasion and placental development — key processes that, when impaired, contribute to placental insufficiency.

### Markedly elevated beta-hCG levels in a normal singleton gestation with hyperreactio luteinalis [^111qB2Rr]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2002). Low credibility.

Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is produced by the trophoblast early in pregnancy and peaks at a level of approximately 100,000 IU/liter around the ninth week of gestation. Abnormally high levels are usually noted in association with multiple gestation, molar gestation, and specific ovarian or gestational malignancies.

- **Cases**: A multiparous patient in the second trimester was referred for evaluation following a maternal triple marker screen was incalculable due to a beta-hCG level of 2.1 million IU/L. Targeted sonography revealed bilateral complex adnexal masses with a solid component of the left ovary, a normal fetus, and normal placenta. The patient underwent an exploratory laparotomy at 18 weeks' gestational age. A left oophorectomy was performed, with pathology confirming hyperreactio luteinalis. The remainder of the pregnancy was remarkable for preterm labor and delivery at 35 weeks' gestational age. At delivery, the hCG level was noted to be 24,210 IU/L, and the fetus and placenta were normal.

- **Conclusion**: Markedly elevated hCG levels rarely occur in normal singleton pregnancy and can be associated with hyperreactio luteinalis. When noted, a work-up to evaluate possible malignancy, molar gestation, and multiple gestation should be pursued.

### Study of first-trimester serum levels of β-hCG and PAPP-A as a screening test for fetal development of intrauterine growth restriction [^111ujuEV]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). High credibility.

The first-trimester combined screening test (11 + 0 to 13 + 6 weeks) for chromosomal abnormalities includes maternal serum markers — PAPP-A and β-hCG — along with nuchal translucency (NT) and maternal age. While the association of these markers with aneuploidies is well established, growing evidence suggests that altered levels, particularly of PAPP-A, may also be linked to adverse obstetric outcomes such as intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR).

PAPP-A is a zinc-binding enzyme that belongs to the metalloproteinase family (metzincins). This glycoprotein is primarily secreted by the trophoblast of the placenta. In uncomplicated pregnancies, PAPP-A is detectable in maternal blood from implantation, with its concentration increasing as gestational age progresses, reaching peak levels at the end of pregnancy. PAPP-A interacts with insulin-like growth factors (IGF). When PAPP-A levels are insufficient to activate IGF, the latter remains in its inactive form, leading to impaired fetal and placental development. This can result in a significant reduction in placental volume and alterations in fetal growth. Additionally, decreased PAPP-A levels have been associated with impaired fetal growth and adverse pregnancy outcomes.

β-hCG is a glycoprotein composed of two amino acid chains (alpha and beta) linked by a disulfide bond. It is secreted by the syncytiotrophoblast and can be detected in maternal blood as early as the ninth or tenth day after ovulation. Its concentration rises rapidly, peaking at the end of the first trimester before gradually declining.

### Advances in the diagnosis and early management of gestational trophoblastic disease [^114HHAvp]. BMJ Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Biochemical diagnosis

Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is a member of the glycoprotein hormone family that includes three pituitary hormones: luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, and thyroid-stimulating hormone. These hormones are heterodimers that share a common alpha (α) subunit but have a unique hormone-specific beta (β) subunit. hCG is a heterogeneous molecule with many different isoforms produced by complex post-translational modification. In early pregnancy (three weeks gestation), hyperglycosylated hCG is produced by the syncytiotrophoblasts of the placenta to promote growth and differentiation. The main hCG variants found in serum or urine include intact hCG (α and β) along with fragments of nicked hCG, nicked hCGβ, and hCGβ core fragment. These five biologically active hCG isoforms are clinically relevant in gestational trophoblastic disease.

- **Human chorionic gonadotropin assays**: Most commercial immunoassays were developed for the detection of hCG in early pregnancy. Total hCG assays detect intact and free β-subunit but will not necessarily detect all isoforms secreted in gestational trophoblastic disease. There is no international standardized hCG assay approved for use in women with this disease. Ideally, hCG should be monitored with an assay that detects all hCG isoforms in equimolar amounts. Gestational trophoblastic disease reference centres should have access to at least two hCG assays, one for primary analysis and another for confirmatory diagnosis. Several factors contribute to the variability in hCG assays, including assay calibration, analyte specificity, and antibody heterogeneity. In the absence of centralized hCG monitoring, hCG should be monitored using available assays at the reference centres.
