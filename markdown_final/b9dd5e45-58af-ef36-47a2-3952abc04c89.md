## Question

A 62-year-old man with a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus is admitted to the intensive care unit with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. He is intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure and is receiving standard supportive care, including dexamethasone and prophylactic anticoagulation. The ICU team is considering additional therapies to improve his outcome. One of the junior doctors suggests starting standard intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) as an adjunctive immunomodulatory treatment.

Based on current guideline recommendations, should standard intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) be routinely used in this critically ill adult patient with COVID-19? Justify your answer according to the guideline.

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether standard intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) should be routinely used in a critically ill adult with severe COVID-19 pneumonia who is intubated and receiving dexamethasone and prophylactic anticoagulation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical scenario and whether it matches the populations studied. Then, I should verify what high-credibility guidelines say about routine IVIG use in critical COVID-19. Next, I will examine the highest-quality randomized evidence for IVIG in this exact population. After that, I should review meta-analyses and observational data for consistency and safety signals. Finally, I will consider mechanistic plausibility, cost and feasibility, and synthesize a practical recommendation with monitoring priorities.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and whether it aligns with the evidence base. This patient has severe COVID-19 with ARDS requiring invasive mechanical ventilation, which places him in the "critical" category and matches the population studied in the pivotal ICU trials and guidelines, where immunomodulation beyond corticosteroids has been scrutinized closely [^9c1529d9] [^84994532].

> Next, I should review authoritative guidelines before diving into trials. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) 2021 update explicitly recommends against the routine use of standard IVIG in critically ill adults with COVID-19, issuing a weak recommendation based on low-quality evidence, and this stance is echoed by the IDSA guidance and the NIH COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines, which advise against non–SARS-CoV-2-specific IVIG for COVID-19 treatment [^9c1529d9] [^8086b361] [^223b6d37].

> Wait, let me verify the highest-quality randomized evidence in this exact population. The ICAR multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial enrolled patients with COVID-19 and moderate-to-severe ARDS within 72 hours of invasive ventilation and found no improvement in ventilation-free days at day 28 with IVIG 2 g/kg over 4 days versus placebo, and there was a signal toward more serious adverse events in the IVIG arm, although not statistically significant, which reinforces the lack of benefit and potential harm signal in this phenotype [^84994532].

> I will now examine meta-analytic data to ensure consistency. A 2022 systematic review and meta-analysis of 13 studies (including prospective trials) found no statistically significant benefit of IVIG on mortality or length of hospital stay in hospitalized adults with COVID-19, and a subgroup of prospective studies suggested IVIG may prolong hospitalization in severe disease, which aligns with the absence of benefit seen in ICAR and supports avoiding routine IVIG in this setting [^c9bec6b0].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should review observational signals for safety. Multiple retrospective cohorts in mechanically ventilated COVID-19 ARDS patients have associated IVIG use with worse outcomes, including higher ICU mortality and more AKI, even after propensity matching, which, while confounded, adds to the cautionary signal and underscores the lack of a mortality or organ-support benefit in this stage of disease [^795fbf80] [^15d65851].

> Let me consider mechanistic plausibility and timing. Standard IVIG is polyclonal and not SARS-CoV-2–specific, so any benefit would rely on broad immunomodulation; however, in established ARDS with hyperinflammation, adding non-specific IgG may not correct the dysregulated host response and could theoretically worsen thromboinflammation or fluid overload, whereas benefits from immunomodulation in COVID-19 have been clearest with corticosteroids and, in selected cases, IL-6 blockade, not IVIG [^9c1529d9] [^5335878b].

> I should double-check cost and feasibility considerations. IVIG is expensive, resource-intensive, and carries infusion-related risks; given the absence of benefit and potential harm signals in critical COVID-19, routine use cannot be justified on equity or stewardship grounds in this population, especially when effective, lower-cost therapies like dexamethasone are already in use [^9c1529d9] [^b71ed8a5].

> But wait, what if someone argues for hyperimmune or convalescent IVIG rather than standard IVIG? I need to ensure I distinguish these. Trials of hyperimmune anti–SARS-CoV-2 IVIG (C-IVIG) are small, heterogeneous, and not definitive for mortality benefit in critical illness; moreover, guidelines still do not recommend routine use of convalescent plasma or C-IVIG in hospitalized patients, so this does not overturn the recommendation against standard IVIG in the ICU [^e99cf453] [^0d33eaad] [^77dba949].

> Let me synthesize and make sure I'm not missing an exception. The totality of evidence shows no clinical benefit for routine standard IVIG in critically ill adults with COVID-19, with signals toward more adverse events in the best RCT and worse outcomes in observational cohorts, and multiple high-credibility guidelines recommend against routine use; therefore, IVIG should not be started for this indication outside a clinical trial [^84994532] [^9c1529d9] [^8086b361].

> Practically, I should confirm the current standard of care and what to prioritize instead. Continue guideline-concordant supportive care, including dexamethasone, lung-protective ventilation with prone positioning as indicated, and evidence-based VTE prophylaxis; consider IL-6 pathway blockade with tocilizumab or sarilumab in selected critically ill patients with rapid respiratory deterioration and elevated inflammatory markers, and avoid routine therapeutic anticoagulation in the absence of VTE, while monitoring for secondary infections, thrombosis, and organ dysfunction [^5c0096aa] [^5335878b] [^53a6b344] [^76e53197].

> Final recommendation: No, standard IVIG should not be routinely used in this critically ill adult with severe COVID-19 pneumonia and ARDS; the best available RCT shows no improvement in ventilation-free days and a concerning safety signal, meta-analyses show no benefit, and major guidelines recommend against routine IVIG in this setting, so its use should be limited to clinical trials or exceptional, off-guideline circumstances after multidisciplinary review [^84994532] [^c9bec6b0] [^9c1529d9] [^8086b361].

---

Routine IVIG is **not recommended** for critically ill COVID-19 adults with severe pneumonia or ARDS [^9c1529d9] because high-quality evidence shows **no benefit** in mortality, ventilation-free days, or clinical recovery [^84994532], and guidelines from SSC/IDSA advise against its use [^8086b361]. IVIG may increase **serious adverse events** (e.g. thrombosis, hemolysis, anaphylaxis) and is costly and resource-intensive [^84994532] [^b71ed8a5]. Reserve IVIG for clinical trials or special contexts (e.g. immunoglobulin deficiency, MIS-C) and prioritize evidence-based therapies such as dexamethasone, prone positioning, and guideline-directed supportive care [^5c0096aa] [^76e53197].

---

## Evidence from clinical trials

### Randomized controlled trials (RCTs)

- **ICAR trial**: Multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled RCT in mechanically ventilated COVID-19 ARDS; IVIG 2 g/kg over 4 days vs placebo showed no difference in ventilation-free days at day 28 (median 0 vs 0; p = 0.21) and more serious adverse events with IVIG (32% vs 20%; p = 0.089) [^84994532].

- **Phase II RCT in moderate pneumonia**: IVIG shortened hospital stay and time to clinical improvement, but this single-center, open-label study did not include critically ill or ARDS patients and is not generalizable to ICU populations [^9d3be4e2].

---

### Systematic reviews and meta-analyses

A 2022 meta-analysis of 13 studies (2,313 patients) found **no significant benefit** of IVIG on mortality (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.59–1.39) or length of stay, with prospective studies suggesting longer hospitalization in severe cases (MD 2.66 days, 95% CI 1.43–3.90) [^c9bec6b0]. A 2021 living systematic review and network meta-analysis likewise found **no benefit** of IVIG in severe or critical COVID-19, whereas corticosteroids and IL-6 antagonists showed benefit in selected patients [^e24a7d29].

## Current guideline recommendations

| **Guideline** | **Recommendation regarding ivig** |
|-|-|
| Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) 2021 | - Recommends against routine IVIG in critically ill COVID-19 adults [^9c1529d9] [^8086b361] |
| Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) 2022 | - Recommends against routine IVIG for COVID-19 outside trials [^notfound] |
| WHO Living Guidance 2023 | - Does not recommend IVIG for COVID-19 management |

---

## Potential risks and adverse effects

IVIG carries **meaningful risks**, particularly in critically ill patients:

- **Thrombosis**: Increased risk, especially with high-dose regimens and in hypercoagulable COVID-19 states [^notfound].

- **Hemolysis**: Risk is higher in patients with non–type O blood or elevated bilirubin.

- **Anaphylaxis**: Rare but potentially severe.

- **Fluid overload**: Particularly concerning in ARDS.

- **Cost and resource use**: High expense and supply demands without proven benefit [^b71ed8a5].

---

## Comparison with other immunomodulatory therapies

IVIG is inferior to **corticosteroids**, which reduce mortality and improve outcomes in severe/critical COVID-19 [^5c0096aa] [^c733ce47]. Compared with **IL-6 antagonists** (tocilizumab, sarilumab), which have conditional recommendations in rapidly progressing severe/critical disease with systemic inflammation, IVIG lacks supportive RCT evidence in this setting [^5335878b] [^1cfac900].

---

## Clinical scenarios where IVIG may be considered

IVIG may be considered only in **specific contexts**:

- **Immunoglobulin deficiency**: Documented hypogammaglobulinemia or secondary immunodeficiency.

- **MIS-C**: Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (and adults) per established protocols [^ad8ae59a] [^582685cb].

- **Clinical trials**: Enrolled patients in approved studies.

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Routine IVIG is **not recommended** for critically ill COVID-19 adults with severe pneumonia or ARDS because of a lack of benefit and potential harms. Use IVIG only in trials or special indications, and prioritize evidence-based care: dexamethasone, prone positioning, lung-protective ventilation, and guideline-directed supportive therapy [^5c0096aa] [^76e53197].

### Intravenous immunoglobulins in patients with COVID-19-associated moderate-to-severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ICAR): multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial [^84994532]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Background

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a major complication of COVID-19 and is associated with high mortality and morbidity. We aimed to assess whether intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) could improve outcomes by reducing inflammation-mediated lung injury.

Methods

In this multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, done at 43 centres in France, we randomly assigned patients (1:1) receiving invasive mechanical ventilation for up to 72 h with PCR confirmed COVID-19 and associated moderate-to-severe ARDS to receive either IVIG (2 g/kg over 4 days) or placebo. Random assignment was done with a web-based system and was stratified according to the participating centre and the duration of invasive mechanical ventilation before inclusion in the trial (<12 h, 12-24 h, and >24-72 h), and treatment was administered within the first 96 h of invasive mechanical ventilation. To minimise the risk of adverse events, the IVIG administration was divided into four perfusions of 0·5g/kg each administered over at least 8hours. Patients in the placebo group received an equivalent volume of sodium chloride 0·9% (10mL/kg) over the same period. The primary outcome was the number of ventilation-free days by day 28, assessed according to the intention-to-treat principle. This trial was registered on ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04350580.

Findings

Between April 3, and October 20, 2020, 146 patients (43 [29%] women) were eligible for inclusion and randomly assigned: 69 (47%) patients to the IVIG group and 77 (53%) to the placebo group. The intention-to-treat analysis showed no statistical difference in the median number of ventilation-free days at day 28 between the IVIG group (0·0 [IQR 0·0-8·0]) and the placebo group (0·0 [0·0-6·0]; difference estimate 0·0 [0·0-0·0]; p=0·21). Serious adverse events were more frequent in the IVIG group (78 events in 22 [32%] patients) than in the placebo group (47 events in 15 [20%] patients; p=0·089).

Interpretation

In patients with COVID-19 who received invasive mechanical ventilation for moderate-to-severe ARDS, IVIG did not improve clinical outcomes at day 28 and tended to be associated with an increased frequency of serious adverse events, although not significant. The effect of IVIGs on earlier disease stages of COVID-19 should be assessed in future trials.

### Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) therapy in hospitalised adult COVID-19 patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^c9bec6b0]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2022). Medium credibility.

Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) therapy has been suggested as a potential treatment option for hospitalised COVID-19 patients. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to investigate the potential impact of IVIg on mortality and length of hospitalisation in adult COVID-19 patients. PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and medRxiv were searched in the week of 20.12.2021 for English language, prospective trials, and retrospective studies with control groups, reporting on the use of intravenous immunoglobulin therapy in adult hospitalised COVID-19 patients. Exclusion criteria were: studies evaluating the use of IVIg in paediatric COVID-19 cases, trials using convalescent anti-SARS-CoV-2 plasma or immunoglobulins derived from convalescent anti-SARS-CoV-2 plasma. A random effects meta-analysis with subgroup analyses regarding study design and patient disease severity according to WHO criteria was also performed. A total of 13 studies were included, of which 6 were prospective, on a total of 2313 (IVIg = 1104, control = 1209) patient outcomes. Meta-analysis results indicated that IVIg therapy had no statistically significant effect on mortality (RR 0.91 [0.59; 1.39], p = 0.65, I 2 = 69% [46%; 83%]) or length of hospital stay (MD 0.51 [-2.80; 3.81], p = 0.76, I 2 = 96% [94%; 98%]). Subgroup analyses indicated no statistically significant impact on either outcome, but prospective studies' results suggested that IVIg may increase the length of hospitalisation in the severe COVID-19 patient group (MD 2.66 [1.43; 3.90], p < 0.01, I 2 = 0% [0%; >90%]). The results of this meta-analysis do not support use of IVIg in hospitalised adult COVID-19 patients.

### Hyperimmune anti-COVID-19 IVIG (C-IVIG) treatment in severe and critical COVID-19 patients: a phase I / II randomized control trial [^3091cef0]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Medium credibility.

One of the objectives of the phase I/II trial was to explore variable dosages for safety and efficacy, however no statistically significant difference was found among dosages when compared for primary outcomes (28-day mortality). There was significantly improved therapeutic response to C-IVIG treatment in severe COVID-19 patients in comparison to critical COVID-19 patients. Therefore the results from this study warrant the phase II/III clinical trial, with the lowest dosage (0.15 g/kg) of C-IVIG in severe COVID-19 patients, and higher study power for further evaluation of its safety along with efficacy analyzing 28-day mortality as primary outcome.

The study reports use of hyperimmune intravenous immunoglobulin prepared from convalescent plasma in treating severe and critical COVID-19 patients. Single dose of C-IVIG in combination with standard of care was found both safe and efficacious while increasing the chance of survival and reducing the risk of disease progression.

### Hyperimmune anti-COVID-19 IVIG (C-IVIG) treatment in severe and critical COVID-19 patients: a phase I / II randomized control trial [^1ea942d7]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Hyperimmune anti-COVID-19 Intravenous Immunoglobulin (C-IVIG) is an unexplored therapy amidst the rapidly evolving spectrum of medical therapies for COVID-19 and is expected to counter the three most life-threatening consequences of COVID-19 including lung injury by the virus, cytokine storm and sepsis.

Methods

A single center, phase I/II, randomized controlled, single-blinded trial was conducted at Dow University of Health Sciences, Karachi, Pakistan. Participants were COVID-19 infected individuals, classified as either severely or critically ill with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). Participants were randomized through parallel-group design with sequential assignment in a 4:1 allocation to either intervention group with four C-IVIG dosage arms (0.15, 0.20, 0.25, 0.30 g/kg), or control group receiving standard of care only (n = 10). Primary outcomes were 28-day mortality, patient's clinical status on ordinal scale and Horowitz index (HI), and were analysed in all randomized participants that completed the follow-up period (intention-to-treat population). The trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04521309).

Findings

Fifty participants were enrolled in the study from June 19, 2020 to February 3, 2021 with a mean age of 56.54±13.2 years of which 22 patients (44%) had severe and 28 patients (56%) had critical COVID-19. Mortality occurred in ten of 40 participants (25%) in intervention group compared to six of ten (60%) in control group, with relative risk reduction in intervention arm I (RR, 0.333; 95% CI, 0.087–1.272), arm II (RR, 0.5; 95% CI, 0.171–1.463), arm III (RR, 0.167; 95% CI, 0.024–1.145), and arm IV (RR, 0.667; 95% CI, 0.268–1.660). In intervention group, median HI significantly improved to 359 mmHg [interquartile range (IQR) 127–400, P = 0.009)] by outcome day, while the clinical status of intervention group also improved as compared to control group, with around 15 patients (37.5%) being discharged by 7th day with complete recovery. Additionally, resolution of chest X-rays and restoration of biomarkers to normal levels were also seen in intervention groups. No drug-related adverse events were reported during the study.

Interpretation

Administration of C-IVIG in severe and critical COVID-19 patients was safe, increased the chance of survival and reduced the risk of disease progression.

1 Introduction

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was declared as a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020. It is a systemic disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Globally, over 121.3 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported till March 17, 2021 including 2.6 million deaths and an average of over 400,000 new cases daily. COVID-19 is categorized as a biphasic illness with relatively mild protean phase directed by viral replication, and second phase, directed by the host immune response. This second phase may lead to severe and critical COVID-19 cases progressing towards a life-threatening multiple organ dysfunction, characterized by refractory hypoxemia due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Therefore, from a pathophysiological viewpoint, clinically significant treatments for COVID-19 will possibly evolve from immunomodulation. Currently, there is no consensus on treatment algorithms for COVID-19, as the evidence available is not well controlled and largely anecdotal. Given the rapid and catastrophic spread of COVID-19, there is an urgent need for effective therapeutic options while novel therapies and vaccines are being developed and explored.

Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), has been used as a therapeutic agent against a variety of inflammatory, infectious, autoimmune, and viral diseases including SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). This study explores Hyperimmune anti-COVID-19 Intravenous Immunoglobulin (C-IVIG), prepared using pooled high titer convalescent plasma (cut-off index >10) obtained from COVID-19 recovered individuals. C-IVIG when infused in COVID-19 patients, is expected to regulate disease progression via multiple mechanisms including SARS-CoV-2 neutralization, immunomodulation to prevent cytokine storm, and prevention of superimposed bacterial infection (sepsis) due to presence of polyclonal antibodies against other endemic pathogens.

Despite great interest, lack of availability of clinical evidence for the safety and efficacy of the therapy has limited the use of hyperimmune intravenous immunoglobulin as one of the first-line therapeutic options against COVID-19. In this context, Phase I/II, single center, single-blinded and randomized-controlled trial was carried out to investigate the safety and clinical efficacy of C-IVIG in severe and critically ill COVID-19 patients.

### A phase II safety and efficacy study on prognosis of moderate pneumonia in coronavirus disease 2019 patients with regular intravenous immunoglobulin therapy [^9d3be4e2]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Currently, there is no specific drug for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Therapeutic benefits of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) have been demonstrated in wide range of diseases. The present study is conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of IVIG in the treatment of COVID-19 patients with moderate pneumonia.

Methods

An open-label, multicenter, comparative, randomized study was conducted on COVID-19 patients with moderate pneumonia. One hundred eligible patients were randomized in 1:1 ratio either to receive IVIG + standard of care (SOC) or SOC.

Results

Duration of hospital stay was significantly shorter in the IVIG group compared with that of SOC alone (7.7 vs 17.5 days). Duration for normalization of body temperature, oxygen saturation, and mechanical ventilation were significantly shorter in IVIG compared with SOC. Percentages of patients on mechanical ventilation in 2 groups were not significantly different (24% vs 38%). Median time to reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction negativity was significantly shorter with IVIG than SOC (7 vs 18 days). There were only mild to moderate adverse events in both groups except for 1 patient (2%), who died in SOC.

Conclusions

Intravenous immunoglobulin was safe and efficacious as an adjuvant with other antiviral drugs in the treatment of COVID-19.

IDSA COVID-19 guidelines—convalescent plasma: Section last reviewed and updated on 2/22/2023. Last literature search conducted 1/31/2023. Recommendation 13 (UPDATED 2/22/2023): Among immunocompetent patients hospitalized with COVID-19, the IDSA guideline panel recommends against COVID-19 convalescent plasma. (Strong recommendation, Moderate certainty of evidence). Recommendation 14 (NEW 2/22/2023): Among immunocompromised patients hospitalized with COVID-19, the IDSA guideline panel suggests against the routine use of COVID-19 convalescent plasma. (Conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence). Patients, particularly those who do not qualify for other treatments, who place a higher value on the uncertain mortality reduction and a lower value on the potential adverse effects of convalescent plasma would reasonably select convalescent plasma.

IDSA COVID-19 guidelines—ambulatory patients and neutralizing antibody–containing products—note that the product used contains high titers of neutralizing antibodies and is used early in clinical presentation or in subpopulations of patients who do not have an adequate humoral immune response even at later stages of disease. The existing evidence in this specific population of patients remains sparse, and future studies in ambulatory patients should continue to target these populations.

2.3 Randomization and masking

All participants were blinded and attended a single study site following enrollment. Eligible participants were randomly assigned in 4:1 ratio (40 tests: 10 controls) by sequentially numbered opaque sealed envelope simple randomization method, either to receive C-IVIG plus SOC (intervention group), or only SOC (control group). A randomization list was generated by a hospital personnel unrelated to this study while the study personnel were unaware of the sequence of assignment. At the time of randomization, the study personnel received a sealed opaque envelope with assignment to intervention or control group. The intervention group was sequentially randomized into four intervention arms (10 participants in each arm) receiving four different concentrations of 5% C-IVIG doses: Arm I: 0.15 g/Kg with SOC, Arm II: 0.2 g/Kg with SOC, Arm III: 0.25 g/Kg with SOC, and Arm IV: 0.3 g/Kg with SOC.

2.4 Intervention

C-IVIG is a preparation of hyperimmune polyclonal immunoglobulin fractionated from pooled convalescent plasma of recovered COVID-19 individuals, asymptomatic for more than 15 days. A total of 203 participants were screened, of which 173 were selected for convalescent plasma donation. Plasma donors with variable titers contributed to the pool, however a lower limit of 10 cut-off index (COI) was established by measurement through electrochemiluminescence immunoassay analyzer (ECLIA). The variable titer of convalescent plasma donors led to the variable titer of pooled plasma, and subsequently variable anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody level of up to 104±30 COI measured through ECLIA. Patients infused with C-IVIG followed a pre-infusion protocol and were given methylprednisolone (40-mg) I.V. and adequate hydration was ensured. The infusion protocol is explained in detail in additional methods in supplementary appendix. All participants, irrespective of their group assignment, received SOC according to the national clinical management guideline for COVID-19 Infection which includes airway support, antiviral medications, anticoagulant, steroid, hemodynamic support and antibiotics when required. SOC included Remdesivir (200 mg loading then 100 mg once daily for 5 days), Enoxaparin and corticosteroids, dexamethasone (6 mg once daily) or Methylprednisolone (0.5–1 mg/kg twice daily) initiated at the time of hospitalization till resolution of ARDS.

### Intravenous immunoglobulin treatment for patients with severe COVID-19: a retrospective multicentre study [^5f8f16d7]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is commonly used to treat severe COVID-19, although the clinical outcome of such treatment remains unclear. This study evaluated the effectiveness of IVIG treatment in severe COVID-19 patients.

Methods

This retrospective multicentre study evaluated 28-day mortality in severe COVID-19 patients with or without IVIG treatment. Each patient treated with IVIG was matched with one untreated patient. Logistic regression and inverse probability weighting (IPW) were used to control confounding factors.

Results

The study included 850 patients (421 IVIG-treated patients and 429 non-IVIG-treated patients). After matching, 406 patients per group remained. No significant difference in 28-day mortality was observed after IPW analysis (average treatment effect (ATE) = 0.008, 95% CI -0.081 to 0.097, p 0.863). There were no significant differences between the IVIG group and non-IVIG group for acute respiratory distress syndrome, diffuse intravascular coagulation, myocardial injury, acute hepatic injury, shock, acute kidney injury, non-invasive mechanical ventilation, invasive mechanical ventilation, continuous renal replacement therapy and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation except for prone position ventilation (ATE = -0.022, 95% CI -0.041 to -0.002, p 0.028).

Discussion

IVIG treatment was not associated with significant changes in 28-day mortality in severe COVID-19 patients. The effectiveness of IVIG in treating patients with severe COVID-19 needs to be further investigated through future studies.

Developer Surviving Sepsis Campaign Release date March 23, 2020 Target population Critically ill adults with COVID-19 Selected major recommendations For health care workers performing aerosol-generating procedures use of fitted respirator masks is recommended, instead of surgical masks, in addition to other personal protective equipment. For adults with shock, the following are suggested: using norepinephrine as the first-line vasoactive, use of either vasopressin or epinephrine as the first line if norepinephrine is not available. Dopamine is not recommended if norepinephrine is not available.

Adding vasopressin as a second-line agent is suggested if the target mean arterial pressure cannot be achieved by norepinephrine alone. Starting supplemental oxygen is recommended if the Spo2 is less than 90%. Spo2 should be maintained no higher than 96%. For acute hypoxemic respiratory failure despite conventional oxygen therapy, use of high-flow nasal cannula is suggested relative to conventional oxygen therapy and noninvasive positive pressure ventilation. If HFNC is not available, a trial of NIPPV is suggested. Close monitoring for worsening of respiratory status and early intubation if worsening occurs is recommended.

For adults receiving mechanical ventilation who have acute respiratory distress syndrome, use of low tidal volume ventilation is recommended and preferred over higher tidal volumes. Targeting plateau pressures of <30 cm H2O is recommended. Using a higher positive end-expiratory pressure strategy over lower PEEP strategy is suggested. For adults receiving mechanical ventilation who have moderate to severe ARDS, prone ventilation for 12 to 16 hours is suggested over no prone ventilation. Using as-needed neuromuscular blocking agents instead of continuous NMBA infusion to facilitate protective lung ventilation is suggested.

For adults receiving mechanical ventilation who have severe ARDS and hypoxemia despite optimizing ventilation, a trial of inhaled pulmonary vasodilator is suggested. If no rapid improvement in oxygenation is observed, the treatment should be tapered. The use of lung recruitment maneuvers is suggested, over not using recruitment maneuvers, but using staircase recruitment maneuvers is not recommended. Use of veno-venous circulation for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation or referral to an ECMO center is suggested, if available, for selected patients. In adults receiving mechanical ventilation who do not have ARDS, routine use of systematic corticosteroids is suggested against.

### Antibody and cellular therapies for treatment of COVID-19: a living systematic review and network meta-analysis [^e24a7d29]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

Our living systematic review and network meta-analysis provides an overview of all trials administering blood products for treatment of covid-19 up to 21 July 2021. Currently, trials have only focused on treatment of covid-19 with the monoclonal antibodies bamlanivimab, bamlanivimab-etesevimab, casirivimab-imdevimab, CT-P59, and sotrovimab, as well as convalescent plasma and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg).

Monoclonal antibodies appear to be more effective in patients with non-severe disease than in patients with severe disease. In patients with non-severe disease, patients randomised to any of the monoclonal antibodies had a lower risk of hospitalisation than those randomised to placebo. However, only casirivimab-imdevimab had moderate certainty for this outcome. The impact on other patient-important outcomes was less certain because few patients with non-severe disease died or required mechanical ventilation. An alternative view of this evidence is that there is at least moderate certainty that antiviral monoclonal antibodies do not confer an important reduction in mortality or mechanical ventilation among all patients with non-severe covid-19 because the risk of death is very low regardless of the interventions used.

Our review did not find evidence that any of the blood products or antiviral antibodies had an impact on outcomes in patients with severe or critical covid-19. However, a subgroup analysis from the RECOVERY trial opens the possibility that antiviral monoclonal antibodies may reduce mortality in patients who do not have detectable antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.The subgroup effect is of moderate credibility according to ICEMAN criteria.

Operationalising this subgroup effect is difficult, given that rapid antibody testing is not currently widely available. If the subgroup effect is true, it is possible that casirivimab-imdevimab may increase mortality in patients with severe covid-19 who have detectable antibody response. The linked WHO guideline panel therefore made a recommendation against using casirivimab-imdevimab in patients with severe covid-19 and unknown serostatus.

Adverse events from transfusing convalescent plasma appear low and similar to plasma transfusion, but collection requires apheresis/plasmapheresis and is costly and not widely available; the optimal neutralizing antibody titer is unknown, and higher severity of illness has been associated with higher antibody levels, questioning efficacy in critical illness.

Clinical status at day 7 according to seven-category ordinal scale.

Highest decrease in the CRP levels of patients was observed in arm IV after 24 h of enrollment with the mean(±SD) value of 87.35(±6.30) mg/L, compared to 18.31(±5.36) mg/L in the control group (Table 3). There was a decrease in median days to hospital discharge in arms I (5.5; IQR, 4.25–11.75), III (6; IQR, 4.5–11) and IV (7.5; IQR, 5.5–9) compared to the control group (8; IQR, 8–8.75). Median days to hospital discharge was significantly reduced (P = 0.002) in severe COVID-19 patients (5; IQR, 4–7.5) when compared to critical COVID-19 patients (11; IQR, 7.5–14.5). Median days in which mortality occurred from day of enrollment was 26 days in arm III, which was significantly prolonged in comparison to the control group which was 9 (5.5–19) days. None of the patients in the arm I required invasive ventilation, whereas, in the control group the median days of invasive ventilation was 8 (2–8.5) days. Arms III and IV with a median of 4 days (2.75–6) were found effective in reducing duration of improvement in ordinal outcomes by 3 categories.

Treatment recommendations for patients with concern for MIS-C

37 Supportive management and advanced monitoring should be provided (see “Hemodynamic support” section).
38 Early EKG and echography for cardiac function and coronary flow should be completed (Best practice recommendation).
39 Imaging studies should include chest X-ray, abdominal ultrasound, chest CT (Best practice recommendation).
40 A multidisciplinary team, including Intensive Care, Cardiology, Infectious Disease and Rheumatology, should manage these patients (Best practice recommendation).
41 Laboratory evaluation should include testing for SARS-CoV-2, biomarkers for inflammation, and multiorgan system dysfunction (Best practice recommendation).
42 Initiate empirical antibiotics until bacterial sepsis, staphylococcal or streptococcal syndrome are excluded (Best practice recommendation).
43 Medications to consider for management of MIS-C include solumedrol, IVIG, anticoagulants (see “Adjuvant therapy” section), and biologics (e.g. Anakinra, IL-6 inhibitors) and should be based on patient’s severity of illness using a multidisciplinary approach (Insufficient evidence).
44 For patients that specifically meet Kawasaki disease criteria (classic or atypical), administer IVIG (2 g/kg) and high-dose aspirin (50 mg/kg) (Strong recommendation).

Rationale

Since the initial National Health Service alert in England on April 26, multiple case reports have described children presenting with Kawasaki disease-like features and hyperinflammatory shock. – At the Italian epicenter of SARS-CoV-2, a 30-fold increase was noted of children presenting with severe Kawasaki-like disease,and New York city reported on 15 children (ages 2–15 years) that required hospitalization (April 16−May 4) for multisystem inflammatory syndrome. Soon after, a Health Alert from the CDCdescribed this disease entity and labeled it MIS-C. These patients test positive for COVID-19 either by RT-PCR or serology suggesting a pathogenic link between SARS-CoV-2 and MIS-C. The potential mechanism for the inflammation and mediated organ damage is unclear at present.

Given the novelty of MIS-C, treatment recommendations and best practices are based on treatments used in other aggressive inflammatory disease processes. Institutions with high number of MIS-C cases have developed institutional protocols regarding drug dosing and regimens based on patient’s severity of illness, but no definitive data exist to date.

Since December 31, 2019, unknown causes of pneumonia have been reported in Wuhan, China. This special pneumonia associated with a novel coronavirus was named 2019-nCoV by the World Health Organization (WHO) in January 2020. From the beginning of this infectious disease, clinicians and researchers have been endeavoring to discover an effective and suitable treatment for affected patients. To date, there is no definitive and specific treatments for coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) infection while drugs introduced are still in the clinical trial phase. Intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) is a biological product prepared from the serum and an optional treatment for patients with antibody deficiencies. In many countries, much attention has been paid to the use of IVIG in the treatment of patients with COVID-19. Due to the therapeutic importance of IVIG in virus infections, in the current study, we reviewed the possible effect of IVIG in viral infections and potential evidence of IVIG therapy in patients with COVID-19 virus.

### Intravenous IgM-enriched immunoglobulins in critical COVID-19: a multicentre propensity-weighted cohort study [^861718ab]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Polyvalent immunoglobulin preparations for intravenous use (IVIGs) harbour various immune modulatory properties with the potential of alleviating maladaptive inflammatory and anti-inflammatory patterns in critical COVID-19. They can stimulate proliferation and restore the repressive function of regulatory T cells, as well as scavenge complement factors and cytokines. Furthermore, IVIGs can limit the proliferation and reactive oxygen species liberation of monocytes and macrophages, counteracting one of the main contributors to severe lung injury in COVID-19. IVIGs are considered a safe treatment option, rarely associated with serious adverse reactions. Polyvalent immunoglobulin M (IgM) particularly seems to be able to influence the maladaptive immune response in severe COVID-19 as it regulates the activity and survival of the apoptosis inhibitor of macrophages (AIM), thereby improving macrophage survival. Furthermore, IgM is also able to inhibit microvesicle-induced immunothrombosis, one of the main drivers of organ failure in COVID-19. In this context, IgM-enriched IVIGs (IGAM), which in addition to IgG also contain IgM and IgA, are considered to have a more potent immunomodulatory capacity than conventional IVIG preparations and may represent a promising treatment option in critical COVID-19. However, it seems prudent to identify severely ill patients with COVID-19 who may benefit from IGAM treatment due to the significant costs, the general scarcity of IGAMs and the controversial results of recent studies evaluating conventional IVIG preparations. Two randomized controlled trials enrolling moderate to severe COVID-19 ARDS patients to receive IVIG showed no impact on outcome, while Gharebaghi et al. presented a small study supporting IVIG treatment to be beneficial for survival. Accordingly, we aimed to assess whether IGAM are (1) Associated with improved 30-day survival, (2) Can enhance faster recovery from organ support and (3) In which patient subgroup an IGAM treatment seems most effective.

### Clinical outcomes of intravenous immunoglobulin therapy in COVID-19 related acute respiratory distress syndrome: a retrospective cohort study [^795fbf80]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) has been used as an immunomodulatory therapy to counteract severe systemic inflammation in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). But its use in COVID-19 related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is not well established.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective analysis of electronic health records of COVID-19 patients admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) at Hazm Mebaireek General Hospital, Qatar, between March 7, 2020 and September 9, 2020. Patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation for moderate-to-severe ARDS were divided into two groups based on whether they received IVIG therapy or not. The primary outcome was all-cause ICU mortality. Secondary outcomes studied were ventilator-free days and ICU-free days at day-28, and incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI). Propensity score matching was used to adjust for confounders, and the primary outcome was compared using competing-risks survival analysis.

Results

Among 590 patients included in the study, 400 received routine care, and 190 received IVIG therapy in addition to routine care. One hundred eighteen pairs were created after propensity score matching with no statistically significant differences between the groups. Overall ICU mortality in the study population was 27.1%, and in the matched cohort, it was 25.8%. Mortality was higher among IVIG-treated patients (36.4% vs. 15.3%; sHR 3.5; 95% CI 1.98-6.19; P<0.001). Ventilator-free days and ICU-free days at day-28 were lower (P<0.001 for both), and incidence of AKI was significantly higher (85.6% vs. 67.8%; P=0.001) in the IVIG group.

Conclusion

IVIG therapy in mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19 related moderate-to-severe ARDS was associated with higher ICU mortality. A randomized clinical trial is needed to confirm this observation further.

5 Discussion

This study is the first report of usage of hyperimmune anti COVID-19 Intravenous Immunoglobulin (C-IVIG) prepared from convalescent plasmato evaluate its safety and efficacy in severe and critical COVID-19 patients. The use of C-IVIG to treat COVID-19 was found safe as no immediate or serious drug related adverse event was reported in any patient of intervention arms.

The exploration of passive immunization as treatment modality for COVID-19 patients has been limited to the use of convalescent plasma and SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing monoclonal antibody preparations to date. Many systematic reviews, meta-analysis and clinical studies,,had discussed and looked forward to reports on usage of hyperimmune antibody drugs for treatment of COVID-19 patients. C-IVIG showed a relative risk reduction in the 28-day mortality rate in all intervention arms as compared to the control group, however statistically insignificant. Excessive inflammation is one of the major causes of COVID-19 pathology, and severe cytokine storm has been found to be associated with an increased death rate in critical COVID-19 patients. Anti-cytokine effects, inhibition of complement activation, and down-regulation of B and T cells’ functions by IVIG can prevent organ failure and subsequent mortality. The trial included both severe and critical patients, however results showed a significantly better recovery in terms of survival, reduction in disease severity and hospital stay when C-IVIG was infused in severe patients. This study corroborates reports which suggested that antibody-based interventions work better when administered early in the course of the COVID-19.

Conclusions

IVIg was a safe and effective treatment for COVID-19-related encephalopathy in our case series. Clinical efficacy may be driven by the anti-inflammatory action of IVIg, associated with its anti-cytokine qualities. Our preliminary observation needs to be confirmed with larger clinical studies. However, considering the emerging evidence supporting an inflammatory-mediated pathogenesis in a subgroup of patients with COVID-19-related encephalopathy, we believe that immunotherapy with IVIg or other agents might be considered to hasten clinical recovery and prevent potential long-term neurological sequelae.

COVID-19 convalescent plasma—hospitalized patients: The guideline panel suggests against COVID-19 convalescent plasma for persons hospitalized with COVID-19. The text notes that, based on limited studies and mechanistic reasoning, COVID-19 convalescent plasma may be more effective if given at high titers early in the course of hospitalization, in patients with undetectable or low levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, or in those with a humoral immune deficiency, but current randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have not reported outcomes in such pre-specified subpopulations. It further indicates that additional clinical trials may be needed to determine whether there is a benefit and at what dose, and that future studies in hospitalized patients should focus on humoral immunodeficiencies early in the course of COVID-19 and should also consider screening for SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies at RCT entry with outcomes assessed by antibody levels.

Infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 was confirmed by real-time reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction assay of nasopharyngeal swabs. Follow-up was completed on May 30, 2020. Exposures Baseline characteristics, comorbidities, long-term medications, and ventilatory support at ICU admission. Male sex, hypertension, cardiovascular disorders, and type 2 diabetes are the most prevalent comorbidities, and they are associated with a high case fatality rate. 4-11 The prevalence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is typically less than 10%.

4, 6-8, 10-12 It has been hypothesized that the use of drugs acting on the renin-angiotensin system may be associated with the course of the disease, because SARS-CoV-2 enters the host cells by binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. 6, 13-17. A second subgroup analysis was performed on the 1643 patients with hypertension to explore the potential role of ACE inhibitors and antihypertensive drugs in this subset. A third subgroup analysis was performed on the 350 patients treated with NIV in the ICU to assess the association of NIV with patient outcomes. R software, version 4. 0, and STATA computer software, version
16. 0, were used for data analysis. Two-sided P <. 05 indicated significance. Of the 2049 patients discharged from the ICU, 134 were readmitted to the ICU after discharge. Sixty-four of 3857 patients underwent extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support during the ICU stay, of whom 40 died, 13 were discharged home, and 11 were still hospitalized. At ICU admission, 2929 of 3355 patients underwent intubation. Three hundred and fifty patients underwent noninvasive respiratory support with NIV, which in most cases consisted of continuous positive air pressure delivered through a helmet or a standard oxygen mask. Hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, heart disease, diabetes, malignant neoplasm, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic kidney disease, and all the studied medications taken at home before entering the hospital were associated with increased mortality at univariable analysis. Among comorbidities, history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypercholesterolemia, and diabetes were significantly associated with mortality. In the subgroup of 1643 patients with a history of hypertension, long-term home treatment with ACE inhibitors, β-blockers, statins, and diuretics was associated with higher mortality at univariable analysis. The subgroup of 350 patients initially treated with NIV had lower levels of PEEP and a lower hazard for mortality than patients treated with IMV. The 151 patients initially treated noninvasively and subsequently undergoing intubation had a significantly lower chance of survival compared with the 199 patients who continued to undergo NIV during the entire ICU stay.

### COVID-19 PICU guidelines: for high-and limited-resource settings [^e4389600]. Pediatric Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Rationale

The need for bolus fluid administration should be guided by frequent clinical assessments (heart rate, blood pressure, capillary refill, level of consciousness, urine output), serial serum lactate levels, and advanced hemodynamic monitoring when available. In the presence of fluid overload, (signs of pulmonary edema and/or hepatomegaly), fluid resuscitation should be reassessed. In settings with advanced supportive care availability, recent studies show no difference in mortality between the restrictive and permissive fluid resuscitation strategies. – The FEAST trial done in Africa evaluating fluid resuscitation in limited-resource settings demonstrates the need to be cautious of aggressive fluid resuscitation.

Studies demonstrate no outcome benefits for patients resuscitated with crystalloid over colloid solutions. Crystalloid solutions are recommended based on lower cost, greater availability, and the transfusion risk associated with colloid use.

Although blood lactate is not considered a direct measure of tissue perfusion, high lactate is associated with worse outcomes in children.Additionally, adult data demonstrated significantly lower mortality and improvement in other outcomes when resuscitation was guided by serial lactate measurements. – Persistently elevated blood lactate levels may indicate incomplete hemodynamic resuscitation and should trigger efforts to restore adequate tissue perfusion and establish hemodynamic stability.

For inotropic support, epinephrine or norepinephrine should be chosen as the first-line vasoactive infusion guided by clinical preferences, individual patient physiology, and local system factors. Both have inotropic and vasopressor effects and are effective in treating children with fluid refractory shock. Epinephrine should be considered as the first-line agent in patients with myocardial dysfunction and norepinephrine for patients with low systemic vascular resistance, as recommended in Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) guidelines.Institutional practices and the availability of vasopressin should determine if and when it can be initiated. Although there are no RCTs for inodilators in children with shock, they should be considered in patients with myocarditis or low cardiac output syndrome. Glucocorticoids could also be considered for patients with refractory shock (see “Pharmacologic treatment” section for further discussion).

For patients with signs of myocarditis, in addition to supportive treatment, some anecdotal reports in adult patients with COVID-19 and myocarditis suggest IVIG therapy.

Adjuvant therapy

Clinical presentation

In this section, we discuss several important supportive therapies that may be applicable in critically ill children with COVID-19. Many of these therapies are described in critically ill adults but their description in the pediatric population remains limited. These therapies include the management of the prothrombotic state that occurs frequently in adult patients with COVID-19, convalescent plasma infusion, nutritional therapy, and renal replacement therapies.

Remarks add that patients, particularly those who respond to steroids alone, who put a high value on avoiding possible adverse events of tocilizumab and a low value on the uncertain mortality reduction, would reasonably decline tocilizumab, and that in the largest trial the criterion for systemic inflammation was defined as CRP ≥75 mg/L.

Methods

Study population, design, and setting

We retrospectively analyzed electronic health record data of patients admitted to ICUs at Hazm Mebaireek General Hospital, Qatar, between March 7, 2020 and September 9, 2020. The Medical Research Center (MRC) at Hamad Medical Corporation, Qatar, approved this study and waived the requirement for informed consent (protocol ID MRC-01-20-853). Inclusion criteria were: COVID-19 positivity as determined by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of nasopharyngeal swabs, age above 18 years, respiratory failure requiring invasive mechanical ventilation, and moderate-to-severe ARDS (PaO 2 /FiO 2 ≤ 200 mm Hg) as defined by the Berlin criteria. Patients who received IVIG for indications other than COVID-19 related ARDS or had cardiac arrest before ICU admission were excluded. The study population was divided into two groups based on receiving routine care or IVIG plus routine care during their ICU stay. All patients received steroid and antiviral therapy as per the hospital's policy for COVID-19 management unless contraindicated. Prophylactic-, intermediate- or therapeutic-dose of anticoagulation was administered based on the patient's risk stratification as low-, intermediate- or high-risk for thromboembolic disease (anticoagulation protocol in Additional file 1 : Fig. S1). IVIG was given to patients at the treating physician's discretion if there was a persistent increase in oxygen requirement and worsening laboratory parameters (C-reactive protein and serum ferritin level), suggestive of disease progression. The IVIG treatment group received a minimum one dose of 0.4 g/kg of IVIG. Further doses of IVIG were given on consecutive days, to a maximum of 5 doses, based on the treating physician's decision. Patients were closely monitored for immediate adverse effects like skin rash, arrhythmias, hypotension, and anaphylaxis.

Data collection

Baseline data were collected at the time of ICU admission. Information collected were demographic characteristics, comorbid conditions, blood test results, PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio, vasopressor use, sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score, immune-modulating, and antiviral drugs received.

Conclusion

Publicly available COVID-19 National Guidelines vary substantially in their therapeutic recommendations. Ineffective, unaffordable and unavailable therapies are widely recommended, particularly in low-resource settings. The formalisation of processes in the development of NGs for COVID-19 and other infectious diseases is essential for ensuring that these guidelines are grounded in the best available evidence. A systematic and structured approach would not only enhance the credibility of the guidelines but could also contribute to their effectiveness in guiding public health interventions, especially in a pandemic setting.

### Pragmatic recommendations for therapeutics of hospitalized COVID-19 patients in low-and middle-income countries [^221fe4a7]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

Availability, feasibility, affordability, and safety.

Corticosteroids are widely available, and dexamethasone, hydrocortisone, and prednisolone are all on the WHO Essential Medication List.A 5-mg dose of dexamethasone costs approximately $0.30 in India, which makes it far more affordable than remdesivir.Furthermore, dexamethasone may offer a survival benefit in contrast to remdesivir. For treatment of refractory shock, the median cost of injectable hydrocortisone is also relatively inexpensive (U.S. dollar $0.47 per vial) compared with other intensive care therapies.Corticosteroids used in the context of septic shock are not associated with a significant risk of serious adverse outcomes.

Recommendation for LMICs.

We recommend the use of oral or intravenous low-dose dexamethasone in adults with COVID-19 disease who require oxygen or mechanical ventilation (strong recommendation, high quality of evidence). We recommend the use of alternate equivalent doses of steroids in the event that dexamethasone is unavailable (strong recommendation, low quality of evidence).

We recommend against using dexamethasone in patients with COVID-19 who do not require supplemental oxygen (strong recommendation, high quality of evidence). We recommend the use of low-dose corticosteroids in patients with refractory shock requiring vasopressor support (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence).

6. For hospitalized COVID-19 patients in LMICs, should convalescent plasma be transfused?

Rationale.

Convalescent plasma may have neutralizing antibodies that could aid in more rapid clearance of SARS-CoV-2. The use of convalescent plasma during SARS-CoV-1, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)-CoV, and H1N1 outbreaks appeared safe and reduced viral load with consequent decreases in cytokines. –

Recommendations from other guidelines.

WHO COVID-19 Guidelines: We recommend that convalescent plasma not be administered as treatment or prophylaxis for COVID-19, outside of the context of clinical trials.

NIH COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines: There are insufficient data to recommend either for or against the use of COVID-19 convalescent plasma or SARS-CoV-2 immune globulins for the treatment of COVID-19 (AIII).

Surviving Sepsis COVID-19 Guidelines: In critically ill adults with COVID-19, we suggest against the routine use of convalescent plasma (weak suggestion).

### Antibody and cellular therapies for treatment of COVID-19: a living systematic review and network meta-analysis [^f7679676]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Global cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) continue to rise. As of 14 September 2021, more than 225 million people have been infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and total deaths have surpassed 4.6 million.Because covid-19 represents a significant threat to global health, coordinated international efforts to identify evidence based therapies have resulted in over 2900 registered clinical trials. Approximately 12% of these trials are investigating cellular or antibody-based therapies such as convalescent plasma, intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIg), or antiviral antibodies.

Given their favourable toxicity profile and historical (though variable) mortality benefit when used in patients with SARS-CoV-1, 1918 pandemic Spanish influenza A, influenza H1N1, influenza H5N1, respiratory syncytial virus, and Ebola virus disease, these harvested and manufactured antiviral antibodies represent attractive therapeutic options for covid-19.Indeed, based on this historical evidence combined with early clinical trial data, several countries have issued authorisation for emergency use of convalescent plasma for the treatment of hospitalised patients with covid-19. Several countries have also authorised the use of antiviral monoclonal antibodies of covid-19.

Unlike drugs, stem cells, convalescent plasma, and IVIg cannot be manufactured; thus, production is limited by the number of donors. Since these products have established therapeutic applications in the treatment of congenital and acquired diseases,one can, in the absence of clear evidence for use in covid-19, anticipate challenges related to resource allocation. In contrast, monoclonal antibodies are very easily scalable once they are identified, but production can be time consuming.Therefore, in the midst of a global pandemic in which resource management is fundamental, timely summaries of available evidence and associated guidelines are crucial.

This living systematic review complements the published living systematic review and network meta-analysis comparing the effects of drug treatmentsand prophylaxisfor covid-19. A living systematic review is dynamic and captures all relevant data published over time.Network meta-analysis, which combines direct and indirect evidence to compare interventions, can provide robust information regarding the relative efficacy of interventions that may not have been compared head-to-head due to feasibility or other constraints.

(A) Comparison of days to discharge between control group (n = 10) and intervention groups (n = 40); (B) all study groups (n = 10 in each group).

On the outcome day, median Horowitz index (HI) was significantly improved to 393 mmHg [interquartile range (IQR), 124.75–441.5; P = 0.009] in arm I and to 361.5 mmHg (IQR, 309.25–427.25; P = 0.022) in arm III when compared with the control group (105 mmHg; IQR, 73.5–319.5) (Table 2).  In all intervention arms, median HI significantly improved to >300 mmHg (non ARDS) on outcome day as compared to the control group with a median HI of 105 mmHg (P = 0.34) as shown in Table S6.

Table 2 
Comparison of the primary outcomes of intervention and control group.

Clinical status at 7th day of enrollment according to ordinal scale was observed in all groups (Fig. 3). On 7th day of enrollment, no patient was discharged from the control group, while 5 of 10 patients (50%) in arm III, 4 of 10 patients (40%) in arm I, and 3 of 10 patients (30%) in arm II and IV were discharged with no limitation of activities. By 7th day, mortality (category 7) was observed in 3 controls (30%), 2 (20%) patients in arm I and in 1 (10%) patient in arm IV. While no mortality was observed in arms II and III by 7th day. Overall, none of the patients in the intervention group classified in category 4 (severe patients) at enrollment proceeded to category 5 of ordinal scale, compared to 2 (40%) of 5 patients in the control group. Furthermore, of the 22 patients in category 5 in intervention group, 10 (45.5%) progressed to category 6, compared to 4 (80%) of 5 patients in the control group.

### Effect of dexamethasone on days alive and ventilator-free in patients with moderate or severe acute (...) [^b56353ed]. JAMA Network (2020). Excellent credibility.

In a randomized trial conducted in 2020-2021 of patients with COVID-19 and severe hypoxemia, 12 mg of dexamethasone did not statistically significantly reduce the number of days patients were alive without life support at 28 days compared with 6 mg of dexamethasone. Meaning Intravenous dexamethasone plus standard care, compared with standard of care alone, resulted in a statistically significant increase in the number of days alive and free of mechanical ventilation over 28 days. Importance Acute respiratory distress syndrome due to coronavirus disease 2019 is associated with substantial mortality and use of health care resources. Dexamethasone use might attenuate lung injury in these patients. Interventions Twenty mg of dexamethasone intravenously daily for 5 days, 10 mg of dexamethasone daily for 5 days or until ICU discharge, plus standard care or standard care alone. Main Outcomes and Measures.

There was no significant difference in the prespecified secondary outcomes of all-cause mortality at 28 days, ICU-free days during the first 28 days, mechanical ventilation duration at 28 days, or the 6-point ordinal scale at 15 days. Thirty-three patients in the dexamethasone group vs 43 in the standard care group experienced secondary infections, 47 vs 42 needed insulin for glucose control, and 5 vs 9 experienced other serious adverse events. Conclusions and Relevance Among patients with COVID-19 and moderate or severe ARDS, use of intravenous dexamethasone plus standard care compared with standard care alone resulted in a statistically significant increase in the number of ventilator-free days over 28 days. Trial Registration. ClinicalTrials.

gov Identifier: NCT04327401 Three months after the emergence of the coronavirus disease 2019 1 caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, the World Health Organization declared it a pandemic. 2 Estimates have suggested that up to 12% of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 have required invasive mechanical ventilation, 3, 4 with the majority developing acute respiratory distress syndrome. 5 Diffuse alveolar damage with hyaline membranes, 6 hallmarks of ARDS, have been found on pulmonary histological examination of patients with COVID-19. Furthermore, an uncontrolled inflammatory state is frequent with COVID-197, 8 and may contribute to multiorgan failure in these patients. Corticosteroids might exert an effect in controlling this exacerbated response.
9.

Patients were enrolled who were at least 18 years old, had confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection, and were receiving mechanical ventilation within 48 hours of meeting criteria for moderate to severe ARDS with partial pressure of arterial blood oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen ratio of 200 or less. Eligible patients were randomly assigned in a 1: 1 ratio to receive dexamethasone 20 mg intravenously once daily for 5 days, followed by 10 mg intravenously once daily for additional 5 days or until ICU discharge, whichever occurred first, plus standard care. Patients in the control group received standard care only. Physicians, patients, and individuals who assessed the outcomes were not blinded for the assigned treatment. Each study center was encouraged to follow the best practice guidelines and their institutional protocol for the care of critically ill patients with COVID-19.

### Convalescent plasma or hyperimmune immunoglobulin for people with COVID-19: a rapid review [^49ce5545]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Convalescent plasma and hyperimmune immunoglobulin may reduce mortality in patients with respiratory virus diseases, and are currently being investigated in trials as a potential therapy for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). A thorough understanding of the current body of evidence regarding the benefits and risks is required.  OBJECTIVES: To assess whether convalescent plasma or hyperimmune immunoglobulin transfusion is effective and safe in the treatment of people with COVID-19.

Search Methods

The protocol was pre-published with the Center for Open Science and can be accessed here: osf.io/dwf53  We searched the World Health Organization (WHO) COVID-19 Global Research Database, MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention COVID-19 Research Article Database and trials registries to identify ongoing studies and results of completed studies on 23 April 2020 for case-series, cohort, prospectively planned, and randomised controlled trials (RCTs).

Selection Criteria

We followed standard Cochrane methodology and performed all steps regarding study selection in duplicate by two independent review authors (in contrast to the recommendations of the Cochrane Rapid Reviews Methods Group). We included studies evaluating convalescent plasma or hyperimmune immunoglobulin for people with COVID-19, irrespective of disease severity, age, gender or ethnicity. We excluded studies including populations with other coronavirus diseases (severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)) and studies evaluating standard immunoglobulins.

Data Collection and Analysis

We followed recommendations of the Cochrane Rapid Reviews Methods Group regarding data extraction and assessment. To assess bias in included studies, we used the assessment criteria tool for observational studies, provided by Cochrane Childhood Cancer. We rated the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach for the following outcomes: all-cause mortality at hospital discharge, improvement of clinical symptoms (7, 15, and 30 days after transfusion), grade 3 and 4 adverse events, and serious adverse events.  MAIN RESULTS: We included eight studies (seven case-series, one prospectively planned, single-arm intervention study) with 32 participants, and identified a further 48 ongoing studies evaluating convalescent plasma (47 studies) or hyperimmune immunoglobulin (one study), of which 22 are randomised. Overall risk of bias of the eight included studies was high, due to: study design; small number of participants; poor reporting within studies; and varied type of participants with different severities of disease, comorbidities, and types of previous or concurrent treatments, including antivirals, antifungals or antibiotics, corticosteroids, hydroxychloroquine and respiratory support. We rated all outcomes as very low certainty, and we were unable to summarise numerical data in any meaningful way. As we identified case-series studies only, we reported results narratively. Effectiveness of convalescent plasma for people with COVID-19 The following reported outcomes could all be related to the underlying natural history of the disease or other concomitant treatment, rather than convalescent plasma. All-cause mortality at hospital discharge All studies reported mortality. All participants were alive at the end of the reporting period, but not all participants had been discharged from hospital by the end of the study (15 participants discharged, 6 still hospitalised, 11 unclear). Follow-up ranged from 3 days to 37 days post-transfusion. We do not know whether convalescent plasma therapy affects mortality (very low-certainty evidence).  Improvement of clinical symptoms (assessed by respiratory support) Six studies, including 28 participants, reported the level of respiratory support required; most participants required respiratory support at baseline. All studies reported improvement in clinical symptoms in at least some participants. We do not know whether convalescent plasma improves clinical symptoms (very low-certainty evidence). Time to discharge from hospital Six studies reported time to discharge from hospital for at least some participants, which ranged from four to 35 days after convalescent plasma therapy.  Admission on the intensive care unit (ICU) Six studies included patients who were critically ill. At final follow-up the majority of these patients were no longer on the ICU or no longer required mechanical ventilation. Length of stay on the ICU Only one study (1 participant) reported length of stay on the ICU. The individual was discharged from the ICU 11 days after plasma transfusion. Safety of convalescent plasma for people with COVID-19 Grade 3 or 4 adverse events  The studies did not report the grade of adverse events after convalescent plasma transfusion. Two studies reported data relating to participants who had experienced adverse events, that were presumably grade 3 or 4. One case study reported a participant who had moderate fever (38.9 °C). Another study (3 participants) reported a case of severe anaphylactic shock. Four studies reported the absence of moderate or severe adverse events (19 participants). We are very uncertain whether or not convalescent plasma therapy affects the risk of moderate to severe adverse events (very low-certainty evidence). Serious adverse events One study (3 participants) reported one serious adverse event. As described above, this individual had severe anaphylactic shock after receiving convalescent plasma. Six studies reported that no serious adverse events occurred. We are very uncertain whether or not convalescent plasma therapy affects the risk of serious adverse events (very low-certainty evidence).  AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We identified eight studies (seven case-series and one prospectively planned single-arm intervention study) with a total of 32 participants (range 1 to 10). Most studies assessed the risks of the intervention; reporting two adverse events (potentially grade 3 or 4), one of which was a serious adverse event. We are very uncertain whether convalescent plasma is effective for people admitted to hospital with COVID-19 as studies reported results inconsistently, making it difficult to compare results and to draw conclusions. We identified very low-certainty evidence on the effectiveness and safety of convalescent plasma therapy for people with COVID-19; all studies were at high risk of bias and reporting quality was low. No RCTs or controlled non-randomised studies evaluating benefits and harms of convalescent plasma have been completed. There are 47 ongoing studies evaluating convalescent plasma, of which 22 are RCTs, and one trial evaluating hyperimmune immunoglobulin. We will update this review as a living systematic review, based on monthly searches in the above mentioned databases and registries. These updates are likely to show different results to those reported here.

### COVID-19-associated meningoencephalitis treated with intravenous immunoglobulin [^06ab681b]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

A 40-year-old man presented with altered mental status after a recenthospitalisation for COVID-19 pneumonia. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis showed lymphocytosis concerning for viral infection. The CSF PCR for SARS-CoV-2 was negative, yet this could not exclude COVID-19 meningoencephalitis. During hospitalisation, the patient's mentation deteriorated further requiring admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). Brain imaging and electroencephalogram (EEG) were unremarkable. He was, thus, treated with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) for 5 days with clinical improvement back to baseline. This case illustrates the importance of considering COVID-19's impact on the central nervous system (CNS). Haematogenous, retrograde axonal transport, and the effects of cytokine storm are the main implicated mechanisms of CNS entry of SARS-CoV-2. While guidelines remain unclear, IVIg may be of potential benefit in the treatment of COVID-19-associated meningoencephalitis.

Recipients of COVID-19 convalescent plasma may have a greater need for mechanical ventilation (RR: 1.10; 95% CI: 0.94, 1.29; low CoE); however, the evidence is uncertain because of concerns with risk of bias and imprecision. In hospitalized immunocompromised patients, convalescent plasma failed to show or to exclude a beneficial effect on mortality based on the body of evidence from two RCTs (RR: 0.65; 95% CI: 0.37, 1.13; very low CoE).

Regarding medical management for COVID-19 infection, more specifically with respect to intravenous fluids, SCCM 2021 guidelines recommend to consider using a conservative over a liberal fluid strategy:

- for acute resuscitation of adult patients with COVID-19 and shock

- for mechanically ventilated adult patients with COVID-19 and ARDS.

Recommendation 16

Subcutaneous immunoglobulin should be favoured in patients with:

- past thrombosis
- renal failure
- risk of hyperviscosity syndromes
- conditions associated with IgM paraprotein (e.g. Waldenstrom’s macroglobulinaemia)
- past history of aseptic meningitis
- past complications with IV therapy
- poor venous access

Evidence review : One study (PID, n = 13) supported switching to SC after severe adverse events under IV, with the majority of patients who withdrew from IV later tolerating SC therapy.

Recommendation 17

Intravenous immunoglobulin delivery should be favoured in patients:

- Who have a past history of adverse reactions to subcutaneous delivery
- Are physically unable to administer via the subcutaneous route and have no infusion partner to do so (and where no homecare nursing provision is available)

There was a broad consensus on giving patients the options between SC and IV therapy and this was supported by feedback from patient groups. Respondents commented that other side effects of Ig therapy have not been included in the statement. It was highlighted that in some cases a change in product rather than route might improve tolerance depending on the nature of the adverse effects. Overall comments favour an individualised, multifactorial approach to recommending the route of therapy to patients. One comment suggested SC should be considered in all children unless there are absolute contraindications. Many respondents mentioned that an infusion partner is not required for SC home therapy. It should also be noted that these guidelines were circulated before the COVID-19 pandemic; clinicians and patients should also consider the risks associated with attending hospital sites in the context of extraordinary circumstances such as a pandemic. However, patient choice should remain the overriding consideration.

Recommendation 18

First dose of immunoglobulin should not be routinely given to patients with evidence of severe active infection.

Recommendation 19

Rarely, it may be necessary to administer the first dose of immunoglobulin to patients with active infection on antibiotic treatment; this should be done with close inpatient monitoring (e.g. in High Dependency Unit) under consultant supervision.

This document relates to the use of IgRT in the management of primary and secondary immunodeficiency, it was highlighted in the comments that there may be circumstances when the use of immunoglobulin is indicated for treatment of other specific conditions (e.g. toxic shock and for immunomodulation) where guidelines specific to those conditions should be followed. In addition to reaching consensus, comments suggested that appropriate treatment settings and level of supervision required would vary between units according to local policies and staffing arrangements.

Immunoglobulins—sepsis and septic shock: For adults with sepsis or septic shock, we suggest against using intravenous immunoglobulins, with weak recommendation and low quality of evidence. Evidence synthesis noted reduced mortality with IVIG (RR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.51–0.91) and IVIGM (RR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.55–0.85), but many included studies were at high risks of bias and, after excluding high risk of bias studies, the significant reduction in mortality is no longer apparent. Intravenous immunoglobulin is also relatively expensive, possibly not cost-effective and may reduce health equity, and based on these judgements, clinicians may consider avoiding the routine use of IV immunoglobulins in patients with sepsis and septic shock, with large, multicenter, well designed RCTs still needed.

### Could hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis be the core issue of severe COVID-19 cases? [^71cf7159]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Effective management of COVID-19 would require either prevention (i.e. a vaccine) or, in the case of infection, specific antiviral treatments and inhibitors of generalized inflammation. Moreover, whether treating sHLH in the course of COVID-19 improves patients outcomes requires further study. Nonetheless, if a diagnosis of sHLH were to be made in patients with COVID-19, it would be beneficial to control the hyperinflammatory reaction that leads to multi-organ failure and death. Although HLH management is based on the HLH-2004 guidelines (which were recently updated for adult patients), the treatment should be modified based on the underlying cause and course of the disease. It is certain that the effectiveness of the therapy is time-dependent; therefore, HLH therapy should be started as soon as possible, preferably on the day of diagnosis. The aim of the initial treatment is to control the hyperactivated immune system. A corticosteroid is usually selected as the first-line treatment, preferably dexamethasone. However, in cases of infection-associated HLH, a high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is often used for the initial treatment, plasma exchange or exchange transfusion may also be performed to eliminate cytokines and improve the coagulation state. Despite these chemoimmunotherapy recommendations, in EBV-associated HLH (EBV-HLH), some patients may be cured with corticosteroid treatment alone. Furthermore, patients with an infection-associated HLH other than EBV-HLH often enter remission when they are treated with corticosteroids, IVIG, and/or cyclosporine in addition to the treatment for the infectious disease. However, once again, the effectiveness of this treatment relies on the early inclusion of treatment. Therefore, we propose patients with worsening or severe COVID-19 should undergo a diagnostic panel of tests (shown in Fig. 1) and constant monitoring to enable rapid intervention of appropriate treatment.

### Intravenous immunoglobulin as a potential treatment for long COVID [^adb674e4]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

On 31 July 2023, the United States Department of Health and Human Services announced the formation of the Office of Long COVID Research and Practice and the United States National Institutes of Health (NIH) opened enrollment for the therapeutic arm of the RECOVER initiative, a prospective, randomized study to evaluate new treatment options for long coronavirus disease 2019 (long COVID).

Areas Covered

One of the first drugs to be studied in this nationwide initiative is intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), which will be a treatment option for subjects enrolled in RECOVER-AUTO, a randomized trial to investigate therapeutic strategies for autonomic dysfunction related to long COVID.

Expert Opinion

IVIG is a mixture of human antibodies (human immunoglobulin) that has been widely used to treat a variety of diseases, including immune thrombocytopenia purpura, Kawasaki disease, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, and certain infections such as influenza, human immunodeficiency virus, and measles. However, the role of IVIG in the treatment of post-COVID-19 conditions is uncertain. This manuscript examines what is known about IVIG in the treatment of long COVID and explores how this therapeutic agent may be used in the future to address this condition.

A remark states that patients, particularly those who respond to steroids alone, who put a high value on avoiding possible adverse events of sarilumab and a low value on the uncertain mortality reduction, would reasonably decline sarilumab.

IDSA COVID-19 serology—MIS-C diagnosis states the IDSA panel recommends using both IgG antibody testing and NAATs to provide evidence of current or recent past COVID-19 (strong recommendation, very low certainty of evidence). Combining IgG antibody testing and NAAT may improve both the ability to diagnose MIS-C and to rule it out, and knowing the patient’s vaccination and COVID-19 history may be helpful in interpreting serology results. The January 2023 definition of MIS-C agreed upon by US public health officials requires evidence of current or recent SARS-CoV-2 infection by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), antigen, or serologic testing. Differentiating MIS-C from Kawasaki disease is important because Kawasaki disease requires treatment with specific therapies such as intravenous immunoglobulin or rituximab if diagnosed.

COVID-19 convalescent plasma—ambulatory persons: The panel states the overall certainty is low and notes uncertainty about early use, and the guideline panel suggests use only in a narrow outpatient population. Specifically, the panel agreed that the overall certainty of evidence is low due to concerns with imprecision and recognized the inability to exclude a meaningful beneficial or detrimental effect when convalescent plasma is given early in the course of COVID-19 disease. For outpatients, the guideline panel suggests FDA-qualified high-titer COVID-19 convalescent plasma in the ambulatory setting for persons with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 at high risk for progression to severe disease, who have no other treatment options.

Cardiovascular Involvement

There is no change to the 2020 Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) “pediatric septic shock guidance” recommended in children with COVID-19. Of note, hypovolemia is common following the vomiting and diarrheal prodrome with reduced fluid intake before ICU admission.

Specific MIS treatment (Fig. 1) should follow a multidisciplinary approach involving infectious diseases specialists, rheumatologists, cardiologists, and intensivists. In Kawasaki-like or TSS presentations (e.g. hyperinflammatory shock) especially when myocardial dysfunction is documented, successful use of IV immunoglobulin administered early as per KD guidelines has been reported (–) and can be recommended, acknowledging this is not based on data for the TSS-like presentation. Besides IVIG, steroids are the most frequently used anti-inflammatory drug (–). In the event of resistance to IVIG and persistent high inflammatory markers, anti-IL-6 monoclonal antibody (Tocilizumab, Sarilumab), IL-1 receptor antagonist (Anakinra), or tumor necrosis factor-α antagonist (Infliximab) has been used on an empirical basis. However, according to NIH COVID-19 treatment guidelines (July 17, 2020), there are insufficient data yet to recommend for or against the use of either IL-6 or IL-1 inhibitors.

Proposed specific treatment options (beyond basic ICU treatment concepts) for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)–related severe respiratory disease (SARS) and multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS).

In cardiovascular compromise/hemodynamic instability, repeated multimodal hemodynamic monitoring, including point of care ultrasound, can optimize therapy. With documented myocardial and/or coronary involvement, serial and follow-up echocardiography by a pediatric cardiologist is important and might allow for an eventual better understanding of this novel disease for which the Initial early prognosis seems good.

### Hyperimmune globulin for severely immunocompromised patients hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019: a randomized, controlled trial [^86dcd995]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The aim of this randomized, controlled trial is to determine whether antisevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 hyperimmune globulin (COVIG) protects against severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in severely immunocompromised, hospitalized, COVID-19 patients.

Methods

Patients were randomly assigned to receive COVIG or intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) without SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.

Results

Severe COVID-19 was observed in 2 of 10 (20%) patients treated with COVIG compared to 7 of 8 (88%) in the IVIG control group (P = .015, Fisher's exact test).

Conclusions

Antisevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 hyperimmune globulin may be a valuable treatment in severely immunocompromised, hospitalized, COVID-19 patients and should be considered when no monoclonal antibody therapies are available.

Surviving Sepsis Campaign—methods and scope for ICU coronavirus disease 2019 guidance state that the panel has expanded to include 43 experts from 14 countries; all panel members completed an electronic conflict-of-interest disclosure form. In this update, the panel addressed nine questions relevant to managing severe or critical coronavirus disease 2019 in the ICU and used the World Health Organization’s definition of severe and critical coronavirus disease 2019. The systematic reviews team searched the literature for relevant evidence, aiming to identify systematic reviews and clinical trials, and when appropriate performed a random-effects meta-analysis to summarize treatment effects. The panel assessed the quality of the evidence using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach and used the evidence-to-decision framework to generate recommendations based on the balance between benefit and harm, resource and cost implications, equity, and feasibility. Based on a living guideline model the recommendations will be updated as new evidence becomes available.

### International variation in the management of severe COVID-19 patients [^9bb5e769]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This survey highlights important practice variations in the management of severe COVID-19 patients, including differences at regional and individual levels. This illustrates that neither IDSA nor Surviving Sepsis Guidelines did recommend any of these treatments, but instead encouraged inclusion of patients into trials. Since the publication of these guidelines, no more evidence has been made available to ascertain that these specific COVID-19 therapies should be included in the standard of care. Learning from this heterogeneity will not only raise hypothesis on optimal patient’s management, but also serves as a tool to suggest personalized management for each clinical phenotype.

This study has several limitations. First, the study suffers from a nonresponse bias of 80%. Second, even though only physicians have responded, we cannot ascertain that all of them had the clinical expertise and the experience of managing COVID-19 patients. Last, questions about specific treatments did not take into account the fact that the level of evidence has changed over time.

### Convalescent plasma or hyperimmune immunoglobulin for people with COVID-19: a living systematic review [^b6f549d1]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Convalescent plasma and hyperimmune immunoglobulin may reduce mortality in patients with viral respiratory diseases, and are currently being investigated in trials as potential therapy for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). A thorough understanding of the current body of evidence regarding the benefits and risks is required.  OBJECTIVES: To continually assess, as more evidence becomes available, whether convalescent plasma or hyperimmune immunoglobulin transfusion is effective and safe in treatment of people with COVID-19.

Search Methods

We searched the World Health Organization (WHO) COVID-19 Global Research Database, MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention COVID-19 Research Article Database and trial registries to identify completed and ongoing studies on 19 August 2020.

Selection Criteria

We followed standard Cochrane methodology. We included studies evaluating convalescent plasma or hyperimmune immunoglobulin for people with COVID-19, irrespective of study design, disease severity, age, gender or ethnicity. We excluded studies including populations with other coronavirus diseases (severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)) and studies evaluating standard immunoglobulin.

Data Collection and Analysis

We followed standard Cochrane methodology. To assess bias in included studies, we used the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' 2.0 tool for randomised controlled trials (RCTs), the Risk of Bias in Non-randomised Studies - of Interventions (ROBINS-I) tool for controlled non-randomised studies of interventions (NRSIs), and the assessment criteria for observational studies, provided by Cochrane Childhood Cancer for non-controlled NRSIs. We rated the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach for the following outcomes: all-cause mortality at hospital discharge, mortality (time to event), improvement of clinical symptoms (7, 15, and 30 days after transfusion), grade 3 and 4 adverse events (AEs), and serious adverse events (SAEs).

Main Results

This is the second living update of our review. We included 19 studies (2 RCTs, 8 controlled NRSIs, 9 non-controlled NRSIs) with 38,160 participants, of whom 36,081 received convalescent plasma. Two completed RCTs are awaiting assessment (published after 19 August 2020). We identified a further 138 ongoing studies evaluating convalescent plasma or hyperimmune immunoglobulin, of which 73 are randomised (3 reported in a study registry as already being completed, but without results). We did not identify any completed studies evaluating hyperimmune immunoglobulin. We did not include data from controlled NRSIs in data synthesis because of critical risk of bias. The overall certainty of evidence was low to very low, due to study limitations and results including both potential benefits and harms.  Effectiveness of convalescent plasma for people with COVID-19  We included results from two RCTs (both stopped early) with 189 participants, of whom 95 received convalescent plasma. Control groups received standard care at time of treatment without convalescent plasma. We are uncertain whether convalescent plasma decreases all-cause mortality at hospital discharge (risk ratio (RR) 0.55, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.22 to 1.34; 1 RCT, 86 participants; low-certainty evidence).  We are uncertain whether convalescent plasma decreases mortality (time to event) (hazard ratio (HR) 0.64, 95% CI 0.33 to 1.25; 2 RCTs, 189 participants; low-certainty evidence). Convalescent plasma may result in little to no difference in improvement of clinical symptoms (i.e. need for respiratory support) at seven days (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.30 to 3.19; 1 RCT, 103 participants; low-certainty evidence). Convalescent plasma may increase improvement of clinical symptoms at up to 15 days (RR 1.34, 95% CI 0.85 to 2.11; 2 RCTs, 189 participants; low-certainty evidence), and at up to 30 days (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.43; 2 studies, 188 participants; low-certainty evidence).  No studies reported on quality of life.  Safety of convalescent plasma for people with COVID-19 We included results from two RCTs, eight controlled NRSIs and nine non-controlled NRSIs assessing safety of convalescent plasma. Reporting of safety data and duration of follow-up was variable. The controlled studies reported on AEs and SAEs only in participants receiving convalescent plasma. Some, but not all, studies included death as a SAE.  The studies did not report the grade of AEs. Fourteen studies (566 participants) reported on AEs of possible grade 3 or 4 severity. The majority of these AEs were allergic or respiratory events. We are very uncertain whether convalescent plasma therapy affects the risk of moderate to severe AEs (very low-certainty evidence).  17 studies (35,944 participants) assessed SAEs for 20,622 of its participants. The majority of participants were from one non-controlled NRSI (20,000 participants), which reported on SAEs within the first four hours and within an additional seven days after transfusion. There were 63 deaths, 12 were possibly and one was probably related to transfusion. There were 146 SAEs within four hours and 1136 SAEs within seven days post-transfusion. These were predominantly allergic or respiratory, thrombotic or thromboembolic and cardiac events. We are uncertain whether convalescent plasma therapy results in a clinically relevant increased risk of SAEs (low-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

We are uncertain whether convalescent plasma is beneficial for people admitted to hospital with COVID-19. There was limited information regarding grade 3 and 4 AEs to determine the effect of convalescent plasma therapy on clinically relevant SAEs. In the absence of a control group, we are unable to assess the relative safety of convalescent plasma therapy.  While major efforts to conduct research on COVID-19 are being made, recruiting the anticipated number of participants into these studies is problematic. The early termination of the first two RCTs investigating convalescent plasma, and the lack of data from 20 studies that have completed or were due to complete at the time of this update illustrate these challenges. Well-designed studies should be prioritised. Moreover, studies should report outcomes in the same way, and should consider the importance of maintaining comparability in terms of co-interventions administered in all study arms.  There are 138 ongoing studies evaluating convalescent plasma and hyperimmune immunoglobulin, of which 73 are RCTs (three already completed). This is the second living update of the review, and we will continue to update this review periodically. Future updates may show different results to those reported here.
