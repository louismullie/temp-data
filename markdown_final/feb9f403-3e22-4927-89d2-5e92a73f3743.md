## Question

The patient reports that one morning he woke up, went to the bathroom as usual, did not have a bowel movement, but noticed a substantial amount of blood on the toilet paper when wiping; he wiped two more times with the same result. He also submitted the stool sample for the test you provided, and the fecal occult blood test was negative. He is presenting today to the outpatient clinic for further workup — any suggestions, and what questions should I ask during the interview?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about evaluating a patient reporting bright-red blood on the toilet paper, no stool passage, and a negative fecal occult blood test, with suggestions for further workup and key interview questions. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what a negative FIT does and does not rule out in a symptomatic patient. Then, I should verify the appropriate initial triage and bedside assessment. Next, I will examine whether anorectal sources could explain "blood only on wiping" and how that affects the need for endoscopy. After that, I need to confirm the indications and timing for colonoscopy versus other modalities. Finally, I should review contingencies such as when to consider an upper GI source, when to pursue small-bowel evaluation, and how medications like anticoagulants factor into management and follow-up.

> Let me first confirm what the negative FIT does not tell us in this symptomatic scenario, because I should not over-interpret a screening test in a patient with overt bleeding. Wait, let me verify the guidance: multiple societies emphasize that FIT is a screening tool for average-risk, asymptomatic populations and is not recommended to triage high-risk symptomatic presentations like hematochezia, because a positive test would still mandate colonoscopy and a negative test can miss significant lesions, potentially delaying diagnosis, so I should not be reassured by a negative FIT here [^111qnUGz] [^113643zL] [^111WVBDw].

> Next, I should review initial assessment and triage, and I need to ensure I do not jump past stabilization. Hold on, I should verify the basics: assess hemodynamics, obtain focused history and exam including medication and comorbidity review, and draw labs to gauge severity while resuscitating as needed; risk tools can assist but should not replace judgment, especially when alarm features are present, and the early plan should align with a lower GI bleed pathway while remaining open to localization shifts as data accrue [^1175KzQd] [^1165fCHX] [^112rKvE9].

> Now, let me consider the bleeding pattern reported: bright-red blood on toilet paper in the absence of stool suggests an outlet source such as hemorrhoids or an anal fissure, particularly if there is pain with defecation or constipation, but I need to check that I do not anchor on this and miss higher-risk pathology; guidelines endorse focused anorectal evaluation with digital rectal exam and anoscopy, and if a clear low-risk source is identified in a low-risk patient, conservative management may be reasonable, yet any high-risk feature or diagnostic uncertainty should prompt colonoscopy rather than reliance on FIT [^notfound] [^111ndzB7] [^113643zL].

> Hold on, let me verify the broader differential so I do not miss less common but important causes: besides hemorrhoids and fissures, solitary rectal ulcer syndrome can present with bleeding and mucus in the context of straining and pelvic floor dysfunction and requires endoscopy with biopsy for diagnosis; radiation proctopathy after pelvic radiotherapy can bleed and should be diagnosed by appearance, not biopsy, given ischemic mucosa; anorectal varices occur in portal hypertension and can bleed substantially, and although uncommon overall, they mandate a portal hypertensive framework of care; of course, colonic neoplasia, diverticulosis, angioectasia, ischemic colitis, IBD, and post-polypectomy bleeding round out common colonic sources that still require colonoscopic evaluation in symptomatic patients [^1116GhYy] [^113ApLDw] [^111WKFyk] [^1165kSwW].

> I should double-check whether the absence of stool passage changes management; hmm, wait a minute, "no stool passage" may simply reflect constipation precipitating outlet bleeding, yet it does not exclude more proximal colonic sources or ongoing lower GI bleeding, so I must avoid premature closure and continue to a definitive colonic evaluation if there are any alarm features, ongoing bleeding, anemia, age risk, or diagnostic uncertainty despite a reassuring anorectal exam [^111ndzB7] [^113643zL] [^111WVBDw].

> Next, I will now examine the indication and timing for colonoscopy, because I need to ensure we proceed appropriately once the patient is stable. I should confirm that major guidelines recommend diagnostic colonoscopy for hematochezia with adequate rapid purge, aiming for within 24 hours for ongoing or high-risk bleeding, whereas stable low-risk bleeds can be scheduled on the next available list with appropriate prep and quality metrics to the cecum; unprepped sigmoidoscopy is discouraged unless specifically indicated, given inferior diagnostic yield [^111XpU6A] [^1121CxEt] [^112hdC4v].

> But wait, what if the bleeding seems severe or the patient is unstable; could this still be an upper source masquerading as hematochezia. I need to check the pathway: in severe hematochezia with hemodynamic instability, guidelines recommend evaluating for a high-risk upper GI lesion, typically by performing an EGD first, because brisk upper bleeding can present as bright red per rectum; clinical features like melena increase the likelihood of an upper source, but absence does not exclude it in shock states, so sequencing EGD before colonoscopy may be warranted in those cases [^112KKwEd] [^113GdV7L] [^113u9Lat].

> If colonoscopy and, when appropriate, upper endoscopy are non-diagnostic and bleeding persists or recurs, I should verify the small-bowel algorithm so I do not miss a mid-gut source. Let me reconsider the next steps: video capsule endoscopy is first-line for small-bowel investigation when there is no obstruction, followed by deep enteroscopy for therapy if lesions are found; in acute overt bleeding, CT angiography or tagged RBC scanning may help localize bleeding and guide angiography timing, and a second-look endoscopy can be appropriate before proceeding to small-bowel evaluation in select cases [^114a8nzD] [^1146s6TT] [^111VaeET].

> I need to ensure I also review medications and coagulopathy, because that can change both the bleeding threshold and post-bleed decisions. Hold on, I should verify that current guidance supports resuming anticoagulation after hemostasis to reduce thromboembolism and mortality, with the exact timing individualized by bleed severity and risk profile; patient education on bleeding signs for DOACs is essential, and case-based data suggest resumption in the 1–2 week range for many mild to moderate GI bleeds, acknowledging that evidence and individual risk can shift this window [^111uadbg] [^1168ehhz] [^113YEN2U].

> Let me synthesize the plan and make sure I have not missed anything critical: do not rely on the negative FIT in a symptomatic patient; perform focused anorectal exam and anoscopy to look for fissures or hemorrhoids while simultaneously triaging severity; if any alarm features, ongoing bleeding, anemia, age risk, or uncertainty are present, proceed to colonoscopy after appropriate purge, with earlier timing for ongoing or high-risk bleeding; consider EGD first in unstable hematochezia to exclude an upper source; if both are negative and bleeding persists or anemia recurs, follow the small-bowel pathway with capsule and targeted interventions; throughout, optimize hemodynamics, review and manage anticoagulants thoughtfully, and arrange appropriate follow-up and safety-netting for recurrent bleeding or new alarm features [^111qnUGz] [^111XpU6A] [^112KKwEd] [^114a8nzD].

The most likely cause of a single episode of bright red rectal bleeding with a negative fecal occult blood test is a benign anorectal source such as hemorrhoids or an anal fissure [^1165kSwW]. A negative test does not exclude visible bleeding; a focused history and exam are essential [^1175KzQd]. Colonoscopy is indicated for patients older than 50 years, those with **risk factors**, or when **bleeding recurs** or remains unexplained [^113643zL] [^111WVBDw]. Immediate evaluation is required when **red flags** are present — anemia, weight loss, change in bowel habits, family history of colorectal cancer, or anticoagulant use [^1175KzQd] [^1165kSwW].

---

## Differential diagnosis

The differential diagnosis for **bright red rectal bleeding** with a negative fecal occult blood test includes:

- **Hemorrhoids**: Most common cause of painless bright red bleeding [^1165kSwW].

- **Anal fissures**: Painful bleeding associated with defecation [^114JWPM8].

- **Rectal polyps or neoplasms**: May cause intermittent bleeding [^111WVBDw].

- **Diverticular disease**: Typically painless, intermittent bleeding [^114xzrJC].

- **Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)**: Associated with chronic inflammation and intermittent bleeding [^1165kSwW].

- **Angiodysplasia**: Vascular malformations causing intermittent bleeding [^114JWPM8].

- **Solitary rectal ulcer syndrome**: Rare, associated with defecation abnormalities [^1116GhYy].

---

## Clinical interview questions

A **focused clinical interview** should include the following questions:

### Characterization of bleeding

Ask about the **color and amount** observed; whether bleeding was painful or associated with discomfort; whether blood was mixed with stool or only on the toilet paper; and whether any clots or mucus were present [^1175KzQd].

---

### Temporal pattern and frequency

Determine whether this was a **single episode or recurrent bleeding**; document changes in bowel habits (constipation, diarrhea, altered stool caliber); and screen for systemic features (recent weight loss, fatigue, weakness) [^113643zL].

---

### Associated symptoms

Ask about **gastrointestinal symptoms** (abdominal pain, cramping, bloating), rectal pain, itching, or discomfort, and any recent fever or chills [^1165kSwW].

---

### Medical and surgical history

Review medical and surgical history, including prior hemorrhoids, anal fissures, or inflammatory bowel disease, as well as any gastrointestinal surgeries or procedures; document any **personal history of colorectal polyps or cancer** [^111WVBDw].

---

### Medication and lifestyle factors

Review medication use — particularly **anticoagulants**, **antiplatelet agents**, or **NSAIDs** — and ask about recent changes in diet, alcohol consumption, tobacco use, and any travel or potential exposure to infectious agents [^1165kSwW] [^111uadbg].

---

### Family history

Ask about family history of **colorectal cancer**, polyps, or inflammatory bowel disease [^111WVBDw].

---

## Physical examination

Perform a thorough exam, including vital signs to assess **hemodynamic stability** [^1165fCHX], and an abdominal examination to palpate for masses, tenderness, or organomegaly. Conduct a **digital rectal examination** to evaluate for hemorrhoids, anal fissures, masses, or other anorectal lesions. When available, perform anoscopy or flexible sigmoidoscopy for direct visualization of the anorectal canal to identify hemorrhoids, fissures, or other lesions [^113643zL] [^1175KzQd].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

Given the negative fecal occult blood test, further diagnostic evaluation should be guided by **clinical suspicion and patient risk factors**:

- **Colonoscopy**: Recommended for patients over 50 years old [^113643zL], those with risk factors for colorectal cancer [^111WVBDw], or if bleeding recurs or remains unexplained [^111qnUGz].

- **Flexible sigmoidoscopy**: Useful for younger patients without risk factors, particularly if bleeding is suspected to originate from the distal colon or rectum [^113643zL].

- **Laboratory tests**: Complete blood count (CBC) to assess for anemia, coagulation profile if anticoagulant use is suspected [^1175KzQd] [^1165fCHX].

---

## Management and follow-up

Tailor management to the **identified cause** [^1165kSwW]. For hemorrhoids or anal fissures, use conservative measures such as dietary modifications, topical treatments, and lifestyle changes [^113k7RmW]. Polyps or neoplasms require endoscopic removal or biopsy followed by appropriate oncological management [^111WVBDw]. Diverticular disease or angiodysplasia may require endoscopic or surgical intervention if bleeding persists; inflammatory bowel disease is treated medically with anti-inflammatory medications and regular follow-up [^114xzrJC] [^112pxZgr].

---

## Patient education and reassurance

Patients should be educated about the benign nature of most anorectal bleeding episodes and advised to monitor for recurrence or worsening symptoms [^1165kSwW]. They should be instructed to **seek immediate medical attention** if they experience:

- Persistent or recurrent bleeding

- Significant abdominal pain

- Weight loss or fatigue

- Changes in bowel habits

- Signs of anemia (pallor, dizziness, shortness of breath) [^1175KzQd]

---

A single episode of bright red rectal bleeding with a negative fecal occult blood test is most likely due to a **benign anorectal condition**. A focused history, physical examination, and appropriate diagnostic evaluation are essential to identify the cause and guide management [^1165kSwW] [^115gAPiS].

### Delphi initiative for early-onset colorectal cancer (DIRECt) international management guidelines [^111qnUGz]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2023). Low credibility.

Colonoscopy is recommended for the diagnostic evaluation of individuals with hematochezia, unexplained iron deficiency anemia, or unexplained weight loss. It should be complete to the cecum and of high quality. The use of colonoscopy for evaluating other symptoms (including a change in bowel habits or abdominal pain) is discussed in section D.2.

Use of alternative diagnostic modalities, including fecal immunochemical tests (FIT), for symptomatic individuals remains controversial. An expanded statement that included FIT reached only 67% agreement (A+, 30.0%; A, 37.5%; A−, 20.0%; D−, 7.5%; D, 5.0%) and was therefore eliminated: "A diagnostic colonoscopy is recommended for evaluation of alarming symptoms and signs of eoCRC (and in case of FIT positivity)". Recent studies have found that FIT performs well in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients younger than age 50. However, the reasons for such disagreement include that a positive FIT result would still require a colonoscopy, which may lead to delays in diagnosis. Delays in obtaining a colonoscopy are associated with an increased risk of advanced-stage disease. Therefore, FIT is not recommended for symptomatic patients. Triaging patients with low-risk symptoms with FIT may be an option (i.e. change in bowel habits or abdominal pain). However, for high-risk symptoms (hematochezia, unexplained iron deficiency anemia, or unexplained weight loss), diagnostic colonoscopy remains the modality of choice.

The systematic review found three studies on the use of FIT and colonoscopy for asymptomatic individuals.

### Visible vessel in diverticular bleeding: a rare sighting [^117Jph9R]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

A 64-year-old male with a remote history of upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding secondary to peptic ulcer disease presented to the emergency department after experiencing hematochezia. He denied abdominal pain, hematemesis, rectal tenderness, or prior hemorrhoids. Upon arrival at the emergency department, the patient experienced a syncopal event during another episode of hematochezia. He was stabilized with intravenous fluids and one unit of packed red blood cells. His hematocrit remained stable, and he was prepared for a colonoscopy overnight.

The colonoscopy revealed moderately severe diverticulosis. Using an Olympus® 190 colonoscope, a diverticulum was noted to have old blood covering it. After irrigation, a non-bleeding visible vessel was observed within the base of the diverticulum. Utilizing near-focus resolution and water immersion, the visible vessel was closely evaluated. A Cook® Instinct clip was then placed across the base of the visible vessel. The patient tolerated the procedure well and had no further bleeding during his hospitalization.

- **Figure 1**: Diverticulum with a non-bleeding visible vessel in the base of a diverticulum.
- **Figure 2**: Cook® Instinct clip placed across the base of the visible vessel.

Early colonoscopy is indicated as a safe and efficacious diagnostic and therapeutic modality for acute lower GI bleeding. While diverticular bleeding is one of the most common causes of lower GI hemorrhage, over 70% of episodes resolve without intervention. Stigmata of bleeding, such as adherent clots and non-bleeding visible vessels, have prognostic significance.

### Management of rectal foreign bodies [^116W73HM]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Patients may complain of vague abdominal pain, rectal bleeding, or pain, and sometimes constipation. Signs of infection or perforation may be evident in complicated cases. Physical examination should include a careful abdominal examination to assess for signs of peritonitis or the ability to palpate an object transabdominally. The rectal foreign body can be palpated in either the left or right lower quadrant of the abdomen.

Rectal examination is essential in the diagnosis, but it should be performed after an X-ray of the abdomen to prevent accidental injury to the surgeon from sharp objects. The foreign body may be palpable in the distal rectum. Bright red blood per rectum is often seen but is not always present. Careful attention should also be paid to the status of the sphincter, especially in patients without a prior history of foreign body placement and in those non-voluntary cases. In patients without sphincter injury, the rectal sphincter may have increased tone secondary to muscular spasm as a result of the foreign object. The sphincter may have obvious damage with visible injury to both the internal and external sphincter and should be carefully examined.

### ACG clinical guideline: Diagnosis and management of small bowel bleeding [^114a8nzD]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2015). High credibility.

Bleeding from the small intestine is relatively uncommon, accounting for approximately 5–10% of all patients presenting with gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. Advances in small bowel imaging, including video capsule endoscopy (VCE), deep enteroscopy, and radiographic imaging, now enable the identification of the source of bleeding in most patients. The term "small bowel bleeding" is proposed to replace the previous classification of obscure GI bleeding (OGIB). The term OGIB should be reserved for patients in whom a source of bleeding cannot be identified anywhere in the GI tract.

A source of small bowel bleeding should be considered in patients with GI bleeding following normal upper and lower endoscopic examinations. Second-look examinations using upper endoscopy, push enteroscopy, and/or colonoscopy can be conducted if indicated before small bowel evaluation.

- **Diagnosis protocol**:
	- VCE should be considered a first-line procedure for small bowel investigation. Any method of deep enteroscopy can be used when endoscopic evaluation and therapy are required, and VCE should be performed before deep enteroscopy if there is no contraindication.
	- Computed tomographic enterography (CTE) should be performed in patients with suspected obstruction before VCE or following negative VCE examinations.
	- In cases of acute overt hemorrhage in unstable patients, angiography should be performed emergently.
	- For patients with occult hemorrhage or stable patients with active overt bleeding, multiphasic computed tomography should be conducted after VCE or CTE to identify the source of bleeding.

### Anorectal emergencies: WSES-AAST guidelines [^1178KYL7]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2021). Low credibility.

In patients with suspected anorectal varices, we suggest checking vital signs, determining hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, and assessing coagulation to evaluate the severity of the bleeding. In cases of severe bleeding, we suggest blood typing and cross-matching (weak recommendation based on very low-quality evidence, 2D).

Anorectal varices (ARV) are defined as discrete, dilated, and submucosal veins extending proximal to the dentate line and into the rectum. They are a known complication of portal hypertension and can occur in up to 89% of patients with portal pressure above 10 mmHg, although the overall incidence in the general population is low. Despite this high prevalence, serious hemorrhage from ARV is uncommon, with significant bleeding reported in less than 5% of such patients, but it can be fatal. The presence of ARV is not directly related to a specific cause of portal hypertension, nor to the grade or extension of other varices (esophageal or gastric); the only clue to suspect this disease is the presence of anorectal bleeding in patients with a history of long-standing or uncontrolled portal hypertension.

As mentioned in relation to bleeding hemorrhoids, the first assessment of patients with hematochezia should follow the indications for the management of acute LIGB. In the case of ARV, a correct and thorough medical history is crucial to suspect this specific disease and can guide the subsequent diagnostic process. It is necessary to define the severity of bleeding and to correctly stratify patient risk.

### Anorectal emergencies: WSES-AAST guidelines [^111ndzB7]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2021). Low credibility.

No recommendation can be made regarding the role of biochemical investigations in patients with suspected thrombosed or strangulated hemorrhoids, based on the available literature.

In patients with suspected bleeding hemorrhoids, we suggest collecting a focused medical history and performing a complete physical examination, including a digital rectal examination, to rule out other causes of lower gastrointestinal bleeding (weak recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 2C).

- **Vital signs and blood assessments**: In patients with suspected bleeding hemorrhoids, we suggest checking vital signs, determining hemoglobin and hematocrit, and assessing coagulation to evaluate the severity of the bleeding (weak recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 2C). In case of severe bleeding, we suggest blood typing and cross-matching (weak recommendation based on very low-quality evidence, 2D).

### Diagnosis and management of gastrointestinal hemorrhage: What you need to know [^112rKvE9]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Acute gastrointestinal (GI) hemorrhage is a common cause for hospital admission that requires prompt diagnosis and multidisciplinary management to optimize clinical outcomes. Acute gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) includes both upper and lower GI tract sources with an extensive list of differential pathologies. This review provides a systematic approach to both upper and lower GIB management, emphasizing initial resuscitation, stabilization, diagnostic evaluation to identify the source, and treatment modalities.

Endoscopy remains the cornerstone for diagnostic and interventional purposes, significantly reducing the need for surgical procedures. However, lower GIB and severe or refractory cases may necessitate additional imaging and interventions, including surgical management. Integrating clinical guidelines, evidence-based strategies, and individualized care, this review delineates what you need to know to diagnose and manage acute GI hemorrhage.

### A case of rectal ulcers during aspirin therapy in acute Kawasaki disease [^111AQcdb]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2020). High credibility.

Dear Editor,

Kawasaki disease (KD) is a febrile multisystem vasculitis of unknown etiology, especially involving coronary arteries. Although the prevalence of gastrointestinal involvement in KD is unknown, gastrointestinal symptoms, including vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain, are relatively common. However, KD with lower gastrointestinal bleeding is quite rare. Here, we describe a 3-year-old boy with typical KD who had lower gastrointestinal bleeding caused by rectal ulcers on the third day of aspirin therapy.

A 3-year-old boy was first seen on day 2 of high fever. On physical examination, an enlarged tonsil, pharyngeal hyperemia, and coarse respiratory sounds of both lungs were noted. No other abnormal findings were present at that time. Laboratory findings were as follows: white blood cell count 14.8×10⁹/L, neutrophils 84.8%, hemoglobin 131 g/L, platelet count 228×10⁹/L, and C-reactive protein 122 mg/L. He was admitted and treated with intravenous antibiotics empirically. The boy remained febrile. Three days later (day 5), the onset of a maculopapular rash on the trunk and limbs, nonexudative conjunctivitis, strawberry tongue, edema of hands and feet, and an enlarged right cervical lymph node led to the diagnosis of KD. Fortunately, echocardiography revealed no dilatation of coronary arteries (2.2 mm left and 2.0 mm right). Then, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG, 2 g/kg) and oral aspirin (50 mg/kg per day) were administered. After IVIG, his fever resolved rapidly. However, hematochezia occurred on day 3 of aspirin therapy. Repeated laboratory examinations revealed white blood cell count abnormalities.

### Manifestation of leech infestation as severe gastrointestinal bleeding in a 3-year-old boy: a case report and review of the literature [^111rnyiu]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

When serving as a physician in developing countries, some extremely rare differential diagnoses should be considered. Leech infestation is one of those rare conditions which can be the source of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. Leeches are a group of hermaphroditic parasites that can attach to several areas in the human body and start sucking blood. They can surprisingly engorge up to 890% of their body weight. Furthermore, they have anticoagulant-like enzymes in their saliva that can lead to severe bleeding after infestation, which, in complicated cases, can also lead to the patient's death. They can involve various parts of the GI tract and the respiratory system, including the nasopharynx, oral cavity, larynx, esophagus, and rectum.

GI bleeding caused by leech infestation can manifest in different patterns, such as epistaxis, hematemesis, melena, and fresh rectal bleeding. Here we present a 3-year-old boy who was transferred to our center with tarry stool and bloody vomiting. He was finally diagnosed with a leech in his stomach.

### Management of patients with acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding: An updated ACG guideline [^111uadbg]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for lower gastrointestinal bleeding, particularly concerning the management of anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy, the general principles outlined in the ACG 2023 guidelines recommend resuming anticoagulation after the cessation of lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB). The resumption of anticoagulation decreases the risks of post-bleeding thromboembolism and mortality.

### British society of gastroenterology practice guidance on the management of acute and chronic gastrointestinal symptoms and complications as a result of treatment for cancer [^113ApLDw]. Gut (2025). High credibility.

Chronic issues after pelvic radiotherapy include radiation-induced rectal bleeding.

- **Radiation-induced rectal bleeding**: Appropriate endoscopic or radiological investigation of the bowel should be arranged, as it cannot be assumed that rectal bleeding after radiotherapy is caused by radiation-induced telangiectasia. Diagnosis of radiation proctopathy should be based on the typical appearance; biopsy confirmation should not be performed. Radiation-induced bleeding is an ischaemic problem; interventions in ischaemic tissue may not heal and may lead to necrosis and perforation.

	- Interventions to stop significant bleeding should be performed only after patients have been informed of the risks and benefits of the intervention and have provided signed informed consent. If bleeding is not affecting quality of life and assessment has excluded underlying malignancy, the patient should be reassured, and the natural history of radiation-induced bleeding explained; intervention is not required.

	- If radiation-induced telangiectasia is the source of bleeding affecting quality of life or causing anaemia, optimising irregular bowel function will often reduce bleeding to a level that no longer affects quality of life. Stopping anticoagulants/antiplatelet agents, if possible, will often reduce bleeding to a level that no longer affects quality of life.

	- Sucralfate enemas can be useful as a temporary treatment until definitive disease-modifying therapy in patients with heavy bleeding is effective or for long-term use in those with problematic bleeding unsuitable for disease-modifying therapy.

### Jujitsu kick to the abdomen: A case of blunt abdominal trauma resulting in hematochezia and transient ischemic colitis [^112HzWrr]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Blunt abdominal trauma is a common presentation in the emergency department. Ischemic colitis is a rare complication of this trauma, and its possible sequelae are important for an emergency physician to recognize. A 21-year-old man presented to the emergency department with abdominal pain and hourly episodes of bright red blood per rectum shortly after being kicked in the stomach at his jujitsu class. He had no significant medical history, and the results of his systems review were otherwise unremarkable.

On examination, he appeared well, with normal vital signs. He had mild lower abdominal tenderness, but there were no peritoneal signs present. Blood was noted on the digital rectal examination. His hemoglobin, platelet, and international normalized ratio levels were normal, and his abdominal radiograph was unremarkable. The gastroenterology service was contacted due to the hematochezia, and a flexible sigmoidoscopy was performed. The sigmoidoscopy showed erythema, ulceration, and edema of a segment in the left colon, consistent with ischemic colitis, which was later confirmed on biopsy.

A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen revealed left colonic inflammation consistent with colonic ischemia. There was no mesenteric vascular thrombosis or mesenteric hematoma found on CT. His hematochezia and abdominal pain subsided spontaneously, and he was discharged home. This case illustrates transient ischemic colitis as a potential presentation of blunt abdominal trauma, and emergency physicians should consider this uncommon diagnosis in the differential diagnosis.

- **Bleedings**: Three patients presented with delayed bleeding.

	- **Case #34**: Minor rectal bleeding occurred 24 hours after ESD of a 6-cm mid-rectum lesion. Hemoglobin level was stable. The bleeding was managed with repeat endoscopy and additional coagulation of the post-resection ulcer. The patient was discharged on postoperative day 1 (moderate AE).

	- **Case #38**: A patient with atrial fibrillation and chronic anticoagulation underwent ESD for a 3.5-cm rectal lesion with extension into the anal canal. Rivaroxaban was held 3 days before ESD, but the patient resumed therapeutic subcutaneous heparin as a bridge immediately after the procedure for 7 days. Severe rectal bleeding occurred 10 days after the ESD, and hypotension ensued. The patient was hospitalized for 3 days, received 2 units of blood transfusions, and endoscopic clipping achieved hemostasis (severe AE).

	- **Case #54**: Resection of a 9-cm anorectal lesion was performed, and on postoperative day 3, the patient experienced minor bleeding without intervention. The hemoglobin level remained stable throughout (mild AE).

No other adverse events were experienced. Specifically, patients did not experience post-resection abdominal pain or fever, and no deaths occurred.

- **Risk of bias**: Our case series showed a low risk of bias in totality in all domains of quality assessment.

### Solitary rectal ulcer: A rare cause of gastrointestinal bleeding in an adolescent with hemophilia A [^1116GhYy]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2001). Low credibility.

Solitary rectal ulcer syndrome (SRUS) is a rarely reported condition in children. The typical presentation involves anorectal pain with the passage of blood and mucus per rectum, usually associated with defecation abnormalities. Diagnosis is confirmed via endoscopy and biopsy. Solitary rectal ulcer syndrome alone is generally a benign condition; however, significant morbidity can occur if complicated by underlying disease states. We report an adolescent with hemophilia A and SRUS who presented with a rectal bleed requiring blood transfusion.

### Gastrointestinal bleeding of obscure origin undetected by multiple tests for fecal occult blood and diagnosed only by capsule endoscopy: A case report [^115gAPiS]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

The term gastrointestinal bleeding of obscure origin is used to describe bleeding of unknown origin that persists or recurs following a negative initial esophagogastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy. We report the case of a middle-aged woman with gastrointestinal bleeding of obscure origin, who had nine stool specimens that tested negative for occult blood but was found to have adenocarcinoma of the distal duodenum on capsule endoscopy. This case illustrates that, in the presence of unexplained iron-deficiency anemia, multiple negative fecal occult blood tests do not exclude the presence of GI blood loss and that capsule endoscopy is a valuable diagnostic study in this context.

The definitions in this document are based on available literature and agreed-upon consensus, prioritizing clinical relevance and applicability. They are intended for use both in clinical practice and for research purposes in future studies.

- **Definitions**:

	- **Statement 1**: Delayed post-polypectomy bleeding is defined as any rectal bleeding occurring within 30 days after the completion of the index colonoscopy that requires emergency room presentation, hospitalization, or reintervention (repeat endoscopy, angiography, or surgery). (Strongly agree: 69.2%; agree: 30.8%)

	- **Statement 2**: Stigmata of recent bleeding is defined as the presence of any of the following findings at a polyp resection mucosal defect: active bleeding (either jet or oozing), a visible vessel, or an adherent clot that remains despite targeted jet irrigation. (Strongly agree: 71.4%; agree: 25%)

	- **Statement 3**: Rebleeding is defined as (1) a new episode of hematochezia or rectorrhagia at least 48 hours after successful hemostatic therapy of the initial delayed post-polypectomy bleeding or after discharge; (2) a new drop in hemoglobin levels greater than 3 g/dL or additional transfusion requirements 48 hours after resolution of the baseline bleeding episode; (3) confirmation of stigmata of recent bleeding at the scar responsible for the initial delayed post-polypectomy bleeding on repeat endoscopy or angio-CT/angiography; and (4) any colonoscopy performed for suspicion of bleeding in research studies. (Strongly agree: 50%; agree: 42.3%)

### The role of endoscopy in the patient with lower GI bleeding [^112KKwEd]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2014). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic procedures for lower gastrointestinal bleeding, particularly lower gastrointestinal endoscopy, the ASGE 2014 guidelines recommend performing lower gastrointestinal endoscopy in patients with severe hematochezia and hemodynamic instability. This is to evaluate for a high-risk upper gastrointestinal lesion if the result of the upper gastrointestinal endoscopy is negative.

### Spontaneous rectal sheath bleed while on DOAC anticoagulation [^113YEN2U]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

Following resolution of the bleeding, the decision of whether and when to restart anticoagulation can be challenging and is often complicated by the presence of extensive comorbidities, the degree of stroke risk, circumstances surrounding the initial bleed, and patient preference. Generally, it is reasonable to restart DOAC therapy 1–2 weeks after most mild to moderate gastrointestinal bleeding. The American Stroke Association recommends an interval of at least 4 weeks before restarting treatment after spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage, but no definitive guidelines have currently been agreed for situations such as the one discussed here. Given the potential for life-threatening complications with both under- and over-treatment, the decision is often difficult.

With the expanding role of DOAC therapy in modern practice, clinicians should be cognizant of the potential risks that accompany what is often a prolonged course of anticoagulation, particularly in patients with multiple comorbidities. Reversal agents are licensed and effective but are also costly and may be prothrombotic. Prompt recognition and early intervention can sometimes greatly improve outcomes. Supportive care only is indicated if a bleed is minor. Finally, whether and when it is appropriate to restart anticoagulation is a challenging decision with the potential for profound consequences. Further research is needed to construct substantive guidelines.

- **Learning points**: The incidence of adverse effects is lower with DOAC therapy than with vitamin K antagonists. However, the increased risk of hemorrhage exists.

### Diverticular bleeding [^114xzrJC]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

Diverticular bleeding is a common cause of lower gastrointestinal hemorrhage. Patients typically present with massive and painless rectal hemorrhage. If bleeding is severe, initial resuscitative measures should include airway maintenance and oxygen supplementation, followed by measurement of hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, and blood typing and crossmatching. Patients may need intravenous fluid resuscitation with normal saline or lactated Ringer's solution, followed by transfusion of packed red blood cells in the event of ongoing bleeding. Diverticular hemorrhage resolves spontaneously in approximately 80 percent of patients.

- **Severe bleeding management**: If there is severe bleeding or significant comorbidities, patients should be admitted to the intensive care unit.

- **Diagnosis and treatment**: The recommended initial diagnostic test is colonoscopy, performed within 12 to 48 hours of presentation and following a rapid bowel preparation with polyethylene glycol solutions. If the bleeding source is identified by colonoscopy, endoscopic therapeutic maneuvers can be performed. These may include injection with epinephrine or electrocautery therapy. If the bleeding source is not identified, radionuclide imaging (i.e. technetium-99m-tagged red blood cell scan) should be performed, usually followed by arteriography.

- **Additional therapeutic options**: For ongoing diverticular hemorrhage, other therapeutic modalities such as selective embolization, intra-arterial vasopressin infusion, or surgery should be considered.

### Is non-Helicobacter pylori, non-NSAID peptic ulcer a common cause of upper GI bleeding? A prospective study of 977 patients [^116cT8Rn]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2001). Low credibility.

Non-Helicobacter pylori, non-NSAID ulcers are relatively common in Western countries. The significance of this issue in the Orient remains unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the incidence of non-H pylori, non-NSAID ulcers presenting with gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding.

- **Methods**: A prospective study was conducted on 1675 consecutive patients presenting with upper GI bleeding over a period of 12 months. Upper endoscopy was performed, and biopsy specimens were taken from the antrum and body of the stomach for a biopsy urease test (BUT) and histology to detect H pylori. Exposure to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) or aspirin within four weeks of hospitalization was carefully scrutinized. A six-week course of treatment with an H2-receptor antagonist was prescribed for patients who did not use an NSAID and had a negative BUT result. Follow-up endoscopy was performed to confirm H pylori status with a BUT and histology, with positive histology at either initial or follow-up endoscopy used as the standard for diagnosing H pylori infection.

- **Results**: Among 977 patients who were found to have ulcer bleeding, 434 (44%) had exposure to aspirin or an NSAID. Of the 543 non-NSAID users, 431 (79.4%) had a positive BUT, and 112 (20.6%) were BUT negative on initial endoscopy. Eighty-nine of the 112 patients who were NSAID negative and BUT negative returned for follow-up endoscopy. Forty-nine of these 89 patients (55.1%) were found to have a positive BUT and positive histology at follow-up endoscopy. Only 40 of 977 (4.1%) patients admitted with ulcer bleeding were confirmed to have non-H pylori, non-NSAID ulcers.

### How I treat gastrointestinal bleeding in congenital and acquired von Willebrand disease [^116jMTzu]. Blood (2020). Low credibility.

Gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding is distinctive of severe von Willebrand disease (VWD), generally arising in older patients; in most cases, blood transfusion and hospitalization are required. The presence of arteriovenous malformations is often described when endoscopic examinations are performed. Patients with congenital type 3, 2A, and 2B are those most frequently affected by this symptom, possibly due to the loss of high-molecular-weight multimers of von Willebrand factor (VWF). GI bleeding can also occur in patients affected by acquired von Willebrand syndrome. Endoscopic examination of the GI tract is necessary to exclude ulcers, polyps, or cancer as possible causes of GI bleeding.

In congenital VWD, prophylaxis with VWF/factor VIII concentrates is generally started after GI-bleeding events, but this therapy is not always successful. Iron supplementation must be prescribed to avoid chronic iron deficiency. Possible rescue therapies include high-dose statins, octreotide, thalidomide, lenalidomide, and tamoxifen, as described in a few case reports and series; however, surgery may be necessary in emergency situations or if medical treatment fails to stop bleeding. In this article, we present several clinical cases that highlight the clinical challenges of these patients and possible strategies for their long-term management.

### ACG clinical guideline: Management of patients with acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding [^1121CxEt]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2016). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic procedures for lower gastrointestinal bleeding and, more specifically, relating to bowel preparation, the ACG 2016 guidelines recommend performing a colonoscopy after adequate colon cleansing in hemodynamically stable patients. Administer 4–6 liters of a polyethylene glycol-based solution (or equivalent) over 3–4 hours until the rectal effluent is clear of blood and stool. Avoid performing an unprepped colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy.

### Lower gastrointestinal bleeding in the elderly: A rare aetiology masquerading as a diverticular bleed [^111GcsfE]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Low credibility.

Bleeding per rectum is a relatively common acute surgical presentation. Common causes include diverticular disease, colitis, hemorrhoids, and polyps. An 83-year-old man with a history of rectosigmoid diverticulitis and bilateral internal iliac artery aneurysms for 2 years presented with rectal bleeding. He was suspected to have a diverticular bleed based on history and examination. A CT scan revealed a large hematoma adjacent to the right isolated internal iliac artery aneurysm (IIIAA), almost indistinguishable from the adjacent rectosigmoid, consistent with a ruptured IIIAA and an ileorectal fistula. The fistula was of a primary vascular enteric type and was accentuated by the inflammation arising from the diverticulitis. Hence, the presence of more common or apparently obvious causes should not deter clinicians from thoroughly investigating the case. Rare causes should be kept in mind while dealing with common acute presentations, especially in elderly patients with multiple comorbidities.

### Urinary tract bleeding from a urethral caruncle mimicking genital tract bleeding [^112xdpDZ]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). Low credibility.

Genital tract bleeding can be falsely considered when patients are bleeding from sources outside of the genital tract, such as the urethra, bladder, anus, rectum, sigmoid colon, or large intestine. Causes of bleeding may be due to systemic diseases, including bleeding disorders, liver and renal diseases, or benign and malignant neoplasms. Diagnostic errors in identifying the source of bleeding can lead to inappropriate consultations, unwarranted testing, and prolonged symptoms. Therefore, it is imperative to accurately locate the source of bleeding through direct observation to ensure appropriate specialist consultation is made in a timely manner.

### Is there a difference in bleeding after left ventricular assist device implant: centrifugal versus axial [^11768hMA]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Numerous studies have shown that the incidence of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding after left ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation varies between 18% and 40%. GI bleeding is classified into upper GI bleeding (proximal to the ligament of Treitz) or lower GI bleeding (distal to the ligament of Treitz). The most common causes are vascular malformations, such as arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) and Dieulafoy lesions, accounting for 30–40% and 15–20%, respectively. In our study, the rates of GI bleeding reported in both cohorts are similar to past studies, with rates between 11% and 13% in the HVAD cohort and 22% in HMII patients. During the index hospitalization, only 11.5% of HMII and 5.9% of HVAD patients experienced GI bleeding. Throughout follow-up, there was no significant difference in the occurrence of a GI bleed between the cohorts up to 36 months of follow-up.

The etiology of GI bleeding following LVAD implantation is multifactorial, given the need for chronic anticoagulation and changes in systemic immunologic and thrombostatic functions. One proposed mechanism of GI bleeding is acquired von Willebrand syndrome due to the fragmentation of high molecular weight multimers of von Willebrand factor (vWF). A study by Meyer et al. demonstrated a reduction in high molecular weight vWF in HVAD patients. This finding suggests that, although HVAD shear forces are low due to the contact-free design and lower revolutions per minute in the HVAD, the shear force still reaches a sufficient threshold to induce vWF unfolding. As a result, both HMII and HVAD patients develop acquired von Willebrand syndrome.

### Occult and obscure gastrointestinal bleeding: Causes and clinical management [^115Q8i2g]. Nature Reviews Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2010). Low credibility.

Occult gastrointestinal bleeding, defined as bleeding unknown to the patient, represents the most common form of gastrointestinal bleeding and can be caused by virtually any lesion in the gastrointestinal tract. Patients with occult gastrointestinal bleeding include those with fecal occult blood and iron-deficiency anemia (IDA). In men and postmenopausal women, IDA should be considered to result from gastrointestinal bleeding until proven otherwise. Indeed, the possibility of gastrointestinal tract malignancy in these patients necessitates a gastrointestinal evaluation in nearly all cases.

Obscure gastrointestinal bleeding is defined as obvious bleeding from a difficult-to-identify source and is always recurrent. This form of bleeding accounts for approximately 5% of all cases of clinically evident gastrointestinal bleeding and most commonly originates from the small intestine. Capsule endoscopy and deep enteroscopy have significantly impacted the management of patients with occult and, in particular, obscure gastrointestinal bleeding. In this review, the causes, diagnostic evaluation, and treatment of occult and obscure gastrointestinal bleeding are discussed.

### Uceris [^112pxZgr]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

In each trial (Study 1 and Study 2), the primary endpoint was the proportion of subjects in remission after six weeks of treatment. Remission was defined as a decrease or no change in the stool frequency subscore from baseline, a rectal bleeding subscore of 0, and an endoscopy score of 0 or 1. An endoscopy subscore of zero is characterized by normal or inactive disease, while a subscore of 1 indicates erythema and decreased vascular pattern.

In each trial (Study 1 and Study 2), a higher proportion of patients in the UCERIS rectal foam group, compared to the placebo group, were in remission at Week 6 and had a rectal bleeding subscore of 0 at Week 6 (Table 4).

- **Endoscopy subscores**: In Study 1, the percentage of patients with an endoscopy subscore of 0 or 1 at Week 6 was 55.6% in the UCERIS rectal foam group versus 43.2% in the placebo group. In Study 2, this was 56.0% in the UCERIS rectal foam group versus 36.7% in the placebo group. An endoscopy subscore of 0 is defined by normal or inactive disease, whereas a subscore of 1 denotes erythema and decreased vascular pattern.

- **Stool frequency subscores**: Among patients who achieved the primary endpoint of remission in Study 1, the mean (SD) decrease in stool frequency subscore was 1.2 (0.9) in the UCERIS rectal foam group and 1.2 (0.8) in the placebo group. In Study 2, the mean (SD) decrease was 1.3 (0.8) in the UCERIS rectal foam group and 1.1 (0.9) in the placebo group.

CI: Confidence Interval.

### Diagnosis and management of lower gastrointestinal bleeding [^114JWPM8]. Nature Reviews Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2009). Low credibility.

Lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB) can present as an acute, life-threatening event or as chronic bleeding, which might manifest as iron-deficiency anemia, fecal occult blood, or intermittent scant hematochezia. Bleeding from the small bowel has been shown to be a distinct entity, and LGIB is defined as bleeding from a colonic source. Acute bleeding from the colon is usually less dramatic than upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage and is self-limiting in most cases.

Several factors might contribute to increased mortality, a severe course of bleeding, and rebleeding, including advanced age, comorbidity, intestinal ischemia, bleeding as a result of a separate process, and hemodynamic instability. Diverticula, angiodysplasias, neoplasms, colitis, ischemia, anorectal disorders, and postpolypectomy bleeding are the most common causes of LGIB.

Volume resuscitation should take place concurrently upon initial patient assessment. Colonoscopy is the diagnostic and therapeutic procedure of choice for acute and chronic bleeding. Angiography is used if colonoscopy fails or cannot be performed. The use of radioisotope scans is reserved for cases of unexplained intermittent bleeding, when other methods have failed to detect the source.

- **Treatment options**:
	- Embolization or modern endoscopy techniques, such as injection therapy, thermocoagulation, and mechanical devices, effectively promote hemostasis. Surgery is the final approach for severe bleeding.

### Distal inferior mesenteric veins to renal vein shunt for treatment of bleeding anorectal varices: Case report and review of literature [^1177LtPn]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

Isolated intractable bleeding from anorectal varices is a rare complication of portal hypertension. We report a case of a patient with cirrhosis and hepatofugal flow who had severe lower gastrointestinal bleeding from anorectal varices. This is the first case report of the construction of a distal inferior mesenteric vein shunt to the left renal vein as a selective shunt for the treatment of bleeding anorectal varices in a patient with hepatofugal flow.

The patient is a 39-year-old white man with a medical history significant for alcohol abuse who was seen with bright red blood per rectum, requiring 10 units of packed red blood cells over the course of a year. The work-up revealed anorectal varices with no other colonic lesions. The patient underwent construction of a distal inferior mesenteric vein to left renal vein shunt.

### Lower gastrointestinal bleeds: False-negative and false-positive tests [^112FcttQ]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2019). Low credibility.

Lower gastrointestinal bleeding in infants and children is a symptom with a broad differential diagnosis. The diagnosis depends on the quantity and quality of the bleeding and the patient's age. We describe a case of a 10-month-old infant who presented to our pediatric emergency department four times with lower gastrointestinal bleeding before a diagnosis of Meckel diverticulum was made. Although this pathology was strongly suspected at an earlier visit, the initial Meckel scan result was interpreted as normal, and the result of a stool test for Clostridium difficile was positive. This case illustrates that repeat scintigraphy might be necessary when significant bleeding is present, even if the results of other diagnostic tests are positive.

### Pradaxa [^1168ehhz]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Inform patients or their caregivers that they may bleed more easily, may bleed longer, and should call their healthcare provider for any signs or symptoms of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

- **Bleeding**: Instruct patients or their caregivers to seek emergency care immediately if they have any of the following signs or symptoms of serious bleeding:
	- Unusual bruising (bruises that appear without known cause or that get bigger)
	- Pink or brown urine
	- Red or black, tarry stools
	- Coughing up blood
	- Vomiting blood, or vomit that looks like coffee grounds

Instruct patients or their caregivers to call their healthcare provider or get prompt medical attention if they experience any signs or symptoms of bleeding:

- Pain, swelling, or discomfort in a joint
- Headaches, dizziness, or weakness
- Recurring nose bleeds
- Unusual bleeding from gums
- Bleeding from a cut that takes a long time to stop
- Menstrual bleeding or vaginal bleeding that is heavier than normal

If patients have had neuraxial anesthesia or spinal puncture, particularly if they are taking concomitant NSAIDs or platelet inhibitors, advise patients or their caregivers to watch for signs and symptoms of spinal or epidural hematoma, such as back pain, tingling, numbness (especially in the lower limbs), muscle weakness, and stool or urine incontinence. If any of these symptoms occur, advise the patient or their caregivers to contact their physician immediately [see Boxed Warning].

- **Gastrointestinal adverse reactions**: Instruct patients or their caregivers to call their healthcare provider if they experience any troubling symptoms.

### Positive guaiac and bloody stool are poor predictors of intussusception [^117K7g1u]. American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Currant jelly stool is a late manifestation of intussusception and is rarely seen in clinical practice. Other forms of GI bleeding have not been thoroughly studied, and little is known about their respective diagnostic values.

- **Objective**: To assess the predictive value of GI bleeding (positive guaiac test, bloody stool, and rectal bleeding) in the evaluation of intussusception.

- **Methods**: We performed a retrospective cross-sectional study cohort of all children, ages 1 month to 6 years, who had an abdominal ultrasound obtained for evaluating intussusception over a 5-year period. We identified intussusception if diagnosed by ultrasound, air-contrast enema, or surgery. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed.

- **Results**: During the study period, 1,258 cases met the study criteria; the median age was 1.7 years (IQR 0.8, 2.9) and 37% were females. Overall, 176 children had intussusception; 153 (87%) were ileo-colic and 23 were ileo-ileal. The univariate risk ratio and adjusted odds ratio were 1.3 (95% CI, 0.8, 2.0) and 1.3 (0.7, 2.4) for a positive guaiac test, 1.1 (0.6, 2.1) and 0.9 (0.3, 3.0) for bloody stool, and 1.7 (1.02, 2.8) and 1.3 (0.5, 3.1) for rectal bleeding.

- **Conclusion**: Blood in stool, whether visible or tested by guaiac test, has poor diagnostic performance in the evaluation of intussusception and is not independently predictive of intussusception. If the sole purpose of a rectal exam in these patients is for guaiac testing, it should be reconsidered.

### Endoscopic treatment of lower gastrointestinal bleeding [^113wjXd5]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2002). Low credibility.

Urgent colonoscopy has emerged as the initial diagnostic and main therapeutic tool in the evaluation and treatment of colonic lower gastrointestinal bleeding. Endoscopic therapy can effectively treat most cases of colonic bleeding with a demonstrable improvement in clinical outcome parameters. The identification of high-risk stigmata of hemorrhage enables selective targeting of endoscopic therapy to lesions at high risk of rebleeding. Advances in technologies, such as novel mechanical methods of hemostasis (e.g. metallic clips), injection techniques (e.g. cyanoacrylate injection), and the widening application of established endoscopic hemostatic techniques (e.g. rubber-band ligation) to colonic lesions, offer the possibility of further improvements in the efficacy of endoscopic hemostasis. Clinical trials are needed to compare these novel endoscopic techniques with more conventional approaches to establish the best form of endoscopic therapy for different bleeding lesions and to determine more definitively the optimal timing of colonoscopy.

### Systematic review of anorectal varices [^111WKFyk]. Colorectal Disease (2013). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on anorectal varices:

- **Definition**: Anorectal varices are enlarged, tortuous veins located in the lower rectum and anus.

- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of anorectal varices is primarily related to portal hypertension. This increased pressure forces blood to flow through smaller collateral veins, leading to the development of varices in the anorectal region. The prevalence of anorectal varices is higher in patients with extrahepatic portal vein obstruction compared to those with liver cirrhosis.

- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of anorectal varices associated with different pathologies varies from 38% to 95%, with an incidence of up to 89% in patients with portal hypertension.

- **Disease course**: Clinically, patients with anorectal varices may present with symptoms such as rectal bleeding, pain, and discomfort. However, these varices are often asymptomatic until they rupture and bleed.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of anorectal varices is largely dependent on the severity of the underlying condition causing portal hypertension. Complications can include bleeding, which can be significant in some cases.

### Small bowel haemorrhage associated with partial midgut malrotation in a middle-aged man [^112Qkmrv]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

A 56-year-old man presented to the Emergency Department after passing bright red blood mixed with dark clots per rectum. He had experienced vague, crampy abdominal pains for the previous two days. His past medical history included hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and ischaemic heart disease. One year prior, he was admitted to the hospital with vague, intermittent central abdominal pain, which resolved following observation for five days.

On admission, he was tachycardic and hypotensive, with no abdominal tenderness or palpable masses. Rectal examination revealed bright red blood and clots on the glove. The admission haemoglobin was 8 g/dl, and serum ferritin was low at 19 μg/L. He was resuscitated and stabilized with intravenous fluids. A computed tomography (CT) scan demonstrated uncomplicated sigmoid diverticular disease and no other pathology to explain his symptoms. He underwent urgent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, which was normal up to the second part of the duodenum, with no signs of haemorrhage. Subsequent colonoscopy showed a colon full of fresh blood and clots up to the caecum, with no obvious bleeding source. Intubation of the small bowel and examination of the terminal ileum showed fresh blood filling the lumen, with a likely bleeding point in the proximal small bowel beyond the reach of the endoscope. At this stage, the patient became haemodynamically unstable, and a decision was made to take the patient for an urgent exploratory laparotomy.

At laparotomy, blood was seen to fill the entire large intestine. The small bowel was filled with blood from the terminal ileum up.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for rectal cancer, specifically in relation to testing indications for lower gastrointestinal bleeding, the USMSTF 2017 guidelines recommend that patients under 50 years old with symptoms of colorectal bleeding — such as hematochezia, unexplained iron deficiency anemia, or melena with a negative upper endoscopy — undergo a colonoscopy or an appropriate evaluation. This aims to determine the cause of bleeding, initiate treatment, and ensure comprehensive follow-up.

### Mucinous carcinoma of the rectum in a boy presenting with bloody diarrhea [^114tvQHQ]. Clinical Colorectal Cancer (2009). Low credibility.

Colorectal carcinoma, primarily a disease affecting adults, accounts for only 0.2% of malignancies in adolescents and is very rarely reported in childhood. This report presents a 15-year-old boy who experienced rectal bleeding, lower abdominal pain, and diarrhea. His physical examination revealed a tender abdomen with hepatomegaly, and a hard mass was palpated during a digital rectal examination. Histological examination confirmed a diagnosis of mucinous rectal adenocarcinoma. Tragically, he died 4 months after diagnosis. This case underscores the importance of considering colorectal carcinomas and their invasive nature in the differential diagnosis of rectal bleeding and diarrhea in adolescents.

### Rectal prolapse [^111CxB52]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2013). High credibility.

Rectal prolapse is a condition that may be associated with chronic straining, a sensation of a bulge from the anus, rectal discharge, cystocele, the presence of a rectal mass, or protruding tissue from the anus. Other symptoms include rectal bleeding, constipation, anal sphincter hypotonia, and a feeling of incomplete evacuation after defecation. Additional associations include uterovaginal prolapse, female sex, a feeling of fullness in the rectum, multiparity, rectal ulcer, age over 50 years, urinary incontinence, and fecal incontinence.

### Acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding [^113LTmCj]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2017). High credibility.

Acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding can be associated with various factors and conditions, including alcohol consumption, melena, hypovolemia, contrast extravasation, and mesenteric ischemia. Patients may present with symptoms such as pallor, fainting, abdominal pain, chest pain, tachycardia, and lightheadedness. Clinical findings may include evidence of recent or ongoing bleeding, colorectal polyps, diverticular disease, liver cirrhosis, portal hypertension, and anal fissures. Additional associations include gastrointestinal surgery, anemia, proctitis, and hemorrhoids. Hematochezia and rectal bleeding are common signs, which may also be accompanied by hypotension and shock. Other potential causes encompass angiodysplasia, anticoagulants, antiplatelets, tobacco use, malignancy, and iron deficiency anemia. Hemorrhagic conditions such as hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) and peritoneal findings like proctitis further complicate diagnosis. In cases of intraluminal accumulation of radiotracer, loss of consciousness, or difficulty breathing, immediate attention is necessary. The presence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) can exacerbate bleeding risks. Overall, acute management requires careful consideration of these various contributing factors and symptoms.

### Benign rectal ulcer: An underground cause of inpatient lower gastrointestinal bleeding [^115JdwoD]. Surgical Endoscopy (2003). Low credibility.

Although it is uncommon, significant bleeding per rectum presents one of the most difficult emergency problems. Bleeding from a rectal ulcer is not well recognized as a cause of such bleeding.

- **Methods**: From July 2000 through December 2000, 195 consecutive patients with significant blood loss per rectum were reviewed.

- **Results**: Forty-eight cases in whom significant gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding occurred following prior hospitalization were identified. Sources of bleeding were gastroduodenal in 38 cases (79%) and colorectal in 10 cases (21%). The causes of inpatient colorectal bleeding were benign rectal ulcer (n = 4), ischemic colitis (n = 3), neoplasia (n = 2), and diversion colitis (n = 1).

- **Conclusion**: The differential diagnosis for inpatients who develop new inpatient GI bleeding differs from that of patients who develop outpatient GI bleeding. Careful examination of the rectum following rectal instrumentation is critical. In addition to the standard resuscitative measures, the identification and treatment of rectal ulcers in this group of patients is of paramount importance. The treatment options for bleeding rectal ulcer include conservative therapy, cauterization, embolization, banding, and local excision.

### Multidisciplinary treatment of synchronous primary rectal and prostate cancers [^116L2bu9]. Nature Clinical Practice Oncology (2005). Low credibility.

A 58-year-old Caucasian man with a history of irritable bowel syndrome and occasional rectal bleeding presented with a 4-week history of progressive, bright red blood per rectum. A digital rectal examination revealed a 3 cm distal, midrectal mass. Laboratory tests showed an elevated serum prostate-specific antigen of 32 ng/ml, but other physical and medical examinations were unremarkable.

- **Investigations**: Digital rectal examination, colonoscopy, rectal mass biopsy, endorectal ultrasound, transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy, CT scan, and MRI.

- **Diagnosis**: Clinical stage III (T3N1M0), moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma of the rectum and clinical stage II (T1cN0M0) adenocarcinoma of the prostate.

- **Management**: Intensity-modulated radiation therapy, chemoradiation, chemotherapy, hormone therapy, and surgery.

### Thinking out of the: a case of obscure lower GI bleeding [^112tSUFE]. Gut (2017). Low credibility.

A middle-aged man was admitted for episodes of fresh per-rectal bleeding, which were not associated with defecation. He was recently investigated for macrocytic anaemia in the outpatient haematology clinic. Examination of the perineum revealed grade 1 internal haemorrhoids with no signs of bleeding. Initial laboratory tests revealed macrocytic anaemia (haemoglobin 10.5 g/dL, normal 12.9–17.0 g/dL; mean corpuscular haemoglobin 95.3 fL, normal 80.0–95.0 fL). Peripheral blood film showed blasts, dysplastic neutrophils, nucleated red blood cells, and hypogranular platelets.

The patient underwent a sigmoidoscopy and rubber band ligation of the internal haemorrhoids after persistent fresh per-rectal bleeding. The bleeding persisted with the development of hypotension and a significant drop in haemoglobin to 4.8 g/dL, requiring blood transfusions and intensive care monitoring. Repeated endoscopy, including intubation of the terminal ileum, revealed uncomplicated right-sided diverticulosis. CT mesenteric angiography performed during an episode of significant bleeding revealed extravasation of contrast in the ileum, but mesenteric angiography was unsuccessful, possibly due to a temporary cessation of bleeding.

Bleeding subsequently recurred, and in light of the persistent bleeding with no clear source and with a total of 12 units of packed cells transfused, an exploratory laparotomy with on-table enteroscopy and small bowel resection was performed. Histopathological examination of the specimen followed.

### Accurate localization of life threatening colonic hemorrhage during nuclear medicine bleeding scan as an aid to selective angiography [^1147SXcq]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Accurate localization of life-threatening colonic hemorrhage during a nuclear medicine bleeding scan can significantly aid in selective angiography. This process involves the careful review of literature and meticulous selection of figures to ensure precise diagnosis and treatment strategies. The emphasis is on compiling comprehensive data and presenting it effectively to enhance the decision-making process in emergency surgical settings.

### Massive rectal bleeding from acquired jejunal diverticula [^112d667S]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

The rectal bleeding recurred at home 10 hours after discharge; the patient experienced an episode of syncope and passed red blood per rectum. She was urgently brought back to the emergency department at our hospital. On physical examination, she was pale and diaphoretic, with a blood pressure of 105/53 mmHg and a pulse rate of 105 beats/min. The abdomen was non-tender, and fresh blood was observed in the rectum. Her haemoglobin level was 8.4 g/dL, haematocrit value was 25%, and thrombocytes were 122 ×10⁹/L.

To localize the source of bleeding, the patient underwent acute abdominal CT angiography, which revealed bleeding in a jejunal diverticulum (Figure 2). The abdominal CT also demonstrated multiple colonic diverticula but did not show any bleeding in the colon. Immediately after diagnosing jejunal diverticular haemorrhage, the patient was brought to the operating room. At laparotomy, multiple large diverticula in a 30 cm segment of jejunum were confirmed, beginning 90 cm distal to the ligament of Treitz (Figure 1). Some smaller diverticula in the distal jejunum were also noted. Systematic exploration of the abdomen revealed diverticulosis of the left colon, but no other lesions were found.

To localize the exact bleeding site, an enterotomy proximal to the most proximal diverticulum was performed, and a gastroscope was introduced. Blood in the intestine at the level of the second diverticulum was found. The 30 cm segment of jejunum containing large diverticula was resected and a primary anastomosis was performed. The patient was transfused with 4 units of packed red cells and 3 units of additional blood products.

### Hematochezia in a patient with liver cirrhosis [^116bStuo]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

A sixty-eight-year-old male, known to have Child's B liver cirrhosis secondary to alcohol abuse, presented to our service with the persistent passage of bright red blood per rectum. Although hemodynamically normal, the bleeding was associated with a two-gram drop in hemoglobin over a 72-hour period and continued despite attempts by medication to reduce his portal venous pressure. He was commenced on propranolol alone for the first 24 hours and then, as the bleeding continued, terlipressin. Additionally, correction of his coagulopathy was undertaken since his INR on admission was 1.7; he was administered Vitamin K intravenously.

A flexible sigmoidoscopy confirmed the clinical suspicion of rectal varices and facilitated endoscopic banding of the culprit anomalies. Significant bleeding ceased immediately after this procedure, allowing continued medical optimization. He was discharged three days later on propranolol, titrated to achieve a resting pulse of 55 bpm, spironolactone, and frusemide. Since then, he has complied with his medical treatment, and the rectal bleeding has not recurred within the first year of follow-up.

### Diagnosis and management of acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding: European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) guideline [^1165fCHX]. Endoscopy (2021). Low credibility.

- **Initial assessment**: ESGE recommends that the initial assessment of patients presenting with acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding should include a history of co-morbidities and medications that promote bleeding, hemodynamic parameters, physical examination (including digital rectal examination), and laboratory markers. A risk score can be used to aid but should not replace clinician judgment. This is a strong recommendation based on low-quality evidence.

- **Self-limited bleed**: ESGE recommends that in patients presenting with a self-limited bleed and no adverse clinical features, an Oakland score of ≤ 8 points can be used to guide the clinician's decision to discharge the patient for outpatient investigation. This is a strong recommendation with moderate-quality evidence.

- **Transfusion strategy for stable patients**: ESGE recommends, in hemodynamically stable patients with acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding and no history of cardiovascular disease, a restrictive red blood cell transfusion strategy, with a hemoglobin threshold of ≤ 7 g/dL prompting red blood cell transfusion. A post-transfusion target hemoglobin concentration of 7–9 g/dL is desirable. This is a strong recommendation based on low-quality evidence.

- **Transfusion strategy for patients with cardiovascular disease**: ESGE recommends, in hemodynamically stable patients with acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding and a history of acute or chronic cardiovascular disease, a more liberal red blood cell transfusion strategy, with a hemoglobin threshold of ≤ 8 g/dL prompting red blood cell transfusion. A post-transfusion target hemoglobin concentration of ≥ 10 g/dL is desirable. This is a strong recommendation based on low-quality evidence.

- **Major bleeding management**: ESGE recommends that in patients with major acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding, colonoscopy is an important diagnostic and therapeutic tool.

### Does this patient have a severe upper gastrointestinal bleed [^113u9Lat]. JAMA (2012). High credibility.

Emergency physicians must determine both the location and severity of acute gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) to optimize diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. This study's objectives were to identify historical features, symptoms, signs, bedside maneuvers, and basic laboratory test results that distinguish acute upper GIB (UGIB) from acute lower GIB (LGIB) and to risk-stratify those patients with a UGIB least likely to have severe bleeding requiring urgent intervention.

- **Data sources**: A structured search of MEDLINE (1966-September 2011) and reference lists from retrieved articles, review articles, and physical examination textbooks was conducted.

- **Study selection**: High-quality studies were included featuring adult patients either admitted with GIB or evaluated in emergency departments with bedside evaluations and/or routine laboratory tests, excluding studies incorporating endoscopic findings in prediction models. The initial search yielded 2628 citations, of which 8 were retained that tested methods of identifying a UGIB and 18 that identified methods of determining UGIB severity.

- **Data extraction**: One author abstracted the data (prevalence, sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios [LRs]) and assessed methodological quality, confirmed by another author. Data were combined using random effects measures.

- **Data synthesis**: The majority of patients (N = 1776) had an acute UGIB (prevalence, 63%; 95% CI, 51%-73%). Several clinical factors increase the likelihood that a patient has a UGIB, including a patient-reported history of melena (LR range, 5.1–5.9).

### Management of patients with severe hematochezia — with all current evidence available [^115ss9Cz]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2005). Low credibility.

A randomized controlled trial (RCT) of routine urgent colonoscopy in severe lower gastrointestinal tract bleeding is reported in this journal from Duke. The only significant differences in results between the standard management (emergency red blood cell (RBC) scanning and angiography with elective colonoscopy) and urgent colonoscopy were in rates of finding a definitive bleeding site — one with a major stigmata of hemorrhage — and in not making a diagnosis. The trial was stopped early for logistical reasons a decade ago.

The strengths and limitations of the study are discussed and contrasted with recent reports of other investigators. Similar to the management of patients with non-variceal upper gastrointestinal tract (UGI) hemorrhage, triaging patients to the level of care by comorbidity scores and stigmata of hemorrhage, successful colonoscopic hemostasis of focal lesions, and individualization of long-term medical, endoscopic, and surgical care are recommended based on promising reports by other investigators. Meanwhile, further RCTs for patients with severe hematochezia are warranted.

### Bilateral phlegmasia cerulea dolens after warfarin reversal for acute rectal bleeding: A case report [^112CZYEB]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a common disease that is diagnosed in approximately 1 in 1000 adults annually. Extensive DVT can lead to life- or limb-threatening conditions such as phlegmasia cerulea dolens (PCD), phlegmasia alba dolens, and venous gangrene. PCD, also known as massive iliofemoral venous thrombosis, is a rare and severe complication of DVT.

- **Case report**: We report a case of a 94-year-old bedridden woman with a past medical history of dementia, hypertension, pulmonary embolism, DVT, and atrial fibrillation. The patient was admitted to the hospital for bright red blood per rectum and an elevated international normalized ratio (INR) of 5.7. On admission, her dose of warfarin was suspended, and she was given 4 units of fresh frozen plasma and 10 mg of intravenous vitamin K. She was discharged home with an INR normalized to 1.3 and cessation of her rectal bleeding. At discharge, she was not restarted on warfarin, nor was any bridging therapy used. The patient returned to the emergency department a week later for worsening pain and bluish discoloration of her bilateral lower extremities. An ultrasound examination showed that she had developed bilateral PCD after INR reversal.

- **Why should an emergency physician be aware of this?**: Emergency physicians commonly care for patients who present with acute DVT or treat patients on anticoagulant therapy who require cessation of medications or administration of prothrombotic agents to reverse bleeding. Cases of extensive clot burden leading to PCD have been reported in the literature; however, reports of bilateral PCD are less common.

### Major stigmata of recent hemorrhage on rectal ulcers in patients with severe hematochezia: Endoscopic diagnosis, treatment, and outcomes [^114vJjik]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2003). Low credibility.

Endoscopic diagnosis and treatment of hematochezia caused by rectal ulcers is poorly described.

- **Methods**: Consecutive patients hospitalized with severe hematochezia underwent urgent colonoscopy after purge. Those with rectal ulcers were divided into two groups based on the absence or presence of major stigmata of recent hemorrhage: active bleeding, visible vessel, or adherent clot. Major stigmata were treated with epinephrine injection and coagulation with a bipolar probe. The primary outcome endpoint was rebleeding within four weeks of diagnosis.

- **Results**: Rectal ulcers were identified in 23 of 285 (8%) patients. Twelve of the 23 patients had major stigmata; these patients had an arithmetically greater decrease in hematocrit and required more blood transfusions than patients without major stigmata. Initial hemostasis was achieved in all, but bleeding recurred in five with stigmata. Four patients died of comorbid conditions. There was no rebleeding or death in those without stigmata.

- **Conclusions**: Patients with rectal ulcers harboring major stigmata are at high risk for severe bleeding, rebleeding, and death. For ulcers with major stigmata, endoscopic hemostasis is feasible, but rates of rebleeding are high.

### Spontaneous rectal sheath bleed while on DOAC anticoagulation [^115rZXrp]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). Low credibility.

DOACs are becoming increasingly prescribed. According to the American Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, apixaban was the 48th most commonly prescribed drug in 2020, ranking higher than both warfarin and rivaroxaban. They have been shown to be more efficacious, better tolerated, and safer than previous anticoagulants in the treatment of venous thromboembolism and the prevention of stroke. They have a rapid onset of action, a short half-life, do not require monitoring, and have fewer drug and dietary interactions than vitamin K antagonists. New antidotes for the reversal of acute major bleeding continue to be developed, further mitigating the risk of severe complications. As their prevalence continues to grow, so does the incidence of their uncommon but significant adverse effects.

Despite their favorable safety profile compared with vitamin K antagonists, the risk of hemorrhage is nevertheless increased in prolonged anticoagulation, particularly in those with comorbid renal failure, liver failure, malignancies, or thrombocytopenia. Bleeding is the most common adverse effect of DOAC therapy, including an increased risk of major gastrointestinal bleeding, intracerebral hemorrhage, and clinically relevant non-major bleeding. Additionally, there is a possible risk increase when used in patients with trauma with pre-injury. A number of incidents of serious bleeds have been reported, many with no history of trauma. Spontaneous internal bleeding is difficult to diagnose quickly given its lack of signs and symptoms until the bleed has progressed significantly.

### Gastrointestinal bleeding in the cancer patient [^1136zwbh]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Gastrointestinal bleeding is a common occurrence in patients with cancer and is often an indicator of a gastrointestinal malignancy. Rapid evaluation and treatment are crucial for the hemodynamically unstable patient. Endoscopy remains the cornerstone of diagnosis and management for cancer patients with gastrointestinal bleeding. The emergency physician should also be aware of other diagnostic and treatment modalities that may be necessary for the care of these patients.

### Acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding [^1165kSwW]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2017). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on lower gastrointestinal bleeding:

- **Definition**: LGIB is defined as gastrointestinal bleeding originating distal to the ileocecal valve, which includes the colon, rectum, and anus.

- **Pathophysiology**: Notable causes of LGIB include diverticulosis (42.5%), ischemic colitis (12.5%), hemorrhoids (12.5%), colorectal polyps or neoplasms (8.5%), angioectasias (7.5%), postpolypectomy bleeding (4.5%), IBD (4%), infectious colitis (3.5%), stercoral ulceration (< 2.5%), colorectal varices (< 1.5%), radiation proctopathy (< 1%), NSAID-induced colopathy (< 1%), and Dieulafoy's lesions (< 1%).

- **Epidemiology**: In the US, the age- and sex-adjusted incidence of hospitalization for LGIB is estimated at 35.7 cases per 100,000 person-years.

- **Disease course**: LGIB classically manifests as hematochezia (maroon or red blood passed through the rectum). Uncommonly, bleeding from the right colon may present with melena. If bleeding is severe, manifestations of hemorrhagic shock may be present.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: LGIB is associated with an estimated bleeding-related mortality of 1.1% (95% CI, 0.6–1.8%) and an overall rebleeding rate of 13.5% (95% CI, 11.8–15.5%).
