## Question

What are the most effective behavioral interventions for pediatric obesity in children under the age of 5?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which behavioral interventions are most effective for pediatric obesity in children under 5 years old. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the exact age range and whether we are treating established obesity or preventing it. Then, I should verify the highest-quality evidence specific to this age group. Next, I will appraise intervention components, dose, and delivery features that correlate with better outcomes. After that, I need to check guideline positions and reconcile any discrepancies. Finally, I will translate this into practical, family-centered recommendations and note evidence gaps and uncertainties, making sure I double-check effect sizes and certainty of evidence before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame and scope. The question targets children under 5 years, which in practice spans infants and toddlers (0–2 years) and preschoolers (2–5 years), and it is crucial to distinguish treatment of established obesity from prevention of excess weight gain, because the evidence base and effect sizes differ and are generally weaker in the under-5 treatment literature than in older children, so I need to be careful not to overgeneralize from 6+ year data to this younger group [^c5786b2d] [^e8b0d66e].

> Next, I should review the most authoritative, age-specific evidence. The 2016 Cochrane review of diet, physical activity, and behavioral interventions for treating overweight/obesity in preschool children up to age 6 found that multicomponent interventions produced modest reductions in BMI z-score at 6–12 months (about −0.3 units) and sustained benefits at 12–18 months and even 2 years in some analyses, albeit with low to very low certainty and small samples, which means I should interpret these effects cautiously and avoid overstating clinical significance [^e8b0d66e]. Wait, let me verify the magnitude and persistence; yes, the pooled MDs around −0.3 to −0.4 BMI z-score units at 6–18 months are consistent across sensitivity analyses, though heterogeneity is high and many trials had risk of bias, so replication and larger trials are needed [^e8b0d66e].

> I will now examine prevention-focused evidence in 2–4 year olds, because many families present before obesity is entrenched. The 2025 Cochrane review of obesity prevention in children aged 2–4 years suggests that combined diet and activity interventions yield very modest reductions in BMI and zBMI at long-term follow-up, on the order of about −0.05 to −0.20 kg/m² and roughly −0.07 zBMI units, again with low to very low certainty and substantial heterogeneity, so I should not overpromise benefit here either [^ccdff021] [^956e38e3]. Hold on, I should verify whether single-component interventions fared worse; yes, diet-only and activity-only arms generally showed little to no effect on BMI/zBMI in this age band, reinforcing that multicomponent approaches are preferred when targeting weight outcomes in early childhood [^ccdff021].

> Let me consider the broader prevention literature in 0–5 years to ensure consistency. The 2019 Cochrane review of childhood obesity prevention reported that diet plus physical activity interventions in 0–5 year olds produced small but statistically significant reductions in BMI and zBMI, whereas diet-only or activity-only interventions did not, which aligns with the notion that combined, family-engaged approaches are more likely to shift adiposity trajectories in early childhood, albeit with modest effect sizes and heterogeneity [^fb3e9edb]. I should double-check that this applies to both prevention and treatment contexts; yes, the directionality is consistent, though treatment trials in preschoolers are sparse and often underpowered [^e8b0d66e].

> Now, I need to appraise intervention features associated with better outcomes. Family involvement and sufficient intensity are repeatedly linked to improved weight outcomes in pediatric obesity, and while most dose–response data come from older children, the principle that ≥ 26 contact hours over 3–12 months yields larger and more consistent BMI reductions is echoed in guidelines and supported by meta-analytic data in 6+ year olds; extrapolating cautiously, preschool programs that embed parent training, home-based practice, and structured behavior change techniques are more plausible to be effective than brief, single-component counseling [^ea9ee289] [^168befe8] [^bc9ec1c6]. Wait, let me verify whether any under-5 trials explicitly tested dose; few did, so this remains an inference grounded in developmental science and older-child evidence rather than direct preschool RCTs, which is a limitation I must acknowledge [^e8b0d66e].

> Next, I should review guideline positions to ensure alignment. The AAP 2023 guideline advises offering intensive health behavior and lifestyle treatment (IHBLT) to children 6 years and older with overweight/obesity and states that clinicians may provide or refer children 2–5 years to IHBLT, emphasizing family-based, multicomponent care with at least 26 contact hours when feasible, while noting the evidence base is more limited in preschoolers; this supports offering structured, family-centered programs to 2–5 year olds even if the certainty is lower than in older children [^30ae37db] [^a8300dcf]. I should confirm that this applies to treatment rather than prevention; yes, the AAP focus is on treatment of established overweight/obesity in 2–5 year olds, not primary prevention, which is a key distinction for counseling families [^30ae37db].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about components; I need to check which elements are most defensible in this age group. Multicomponent interventions that combine nutrition counseling (often focused on reducing sugar-sweetened beverages, improving dietary patterns, and age-appropriate portion sizes), physical activity promotion (active play, daily movement goals), and behavioral strategies (parental monitoring, routines, positive reinforcement, stimulus control) are consistently associated with better outcomes than single-component approaches in early childhood, even though effect sizes remain modest and long-term durability is uncertain [^e8b0d66e] [^ccdff021] [^fb3e9edb]. Let me reconsider whether any single-component strategy stands out; no, diet-only and activity-only arms generally fail to move BMI/zBMI meaningfully in this age band, reinforcing the need for integrated, family-based packages [^ccdff021] [^fb3e9edb].

> I should confirm delivery features that are feasible and acceptable in this age group. Home-based or childcare-integrated delivery, parent-only or parent–child formats, and use of behavior change techniques such as goal setting, self-monitoring, and problem solving are commonly used in effective early-childhood programs; however, many trials are small, heterogeneous, and underpowered, so replication with larger, rigorously designed RCTs is needed before we can specify a "best" protocol with confidence [^e8b0d66e] [^15d1b8d2]. But wait, what if digital or telehealth approaches help with reach; evidence is emerging but still limited in this exact age group, so these can be considered adjuncts rather than replacements for face-to-face family-based care when targeting weight outcomes [^e61b877d] [^0842ca56].

> Let me translate this into practical clinical guidance while keeping uncertainties explicit. For children 2–5 years with overweight or obesity, I recommend offering a family-based, multicomponent behavioral intervention that includes nutrition, physical activity, and behavior change components, ideally totaling at least 26 contact hours over 3–12 months, delivered in person when possible and tailored to developmental and cultural context; if 26 hours is not feasible, medium-intensity programs (about 5–25 hours) may still yield modest benefits and are reasonable alternatives, acknowledging weaker evidence in this exact dose range for preschoolers [^30ae37db] [^168befe8]. I need to ensure families understand that expected BMI z-score reductions are small, on the order of roughly 0.2–0.4 units over 6–18 months, and that sustained effects require ongoing family engagement and environmental supports beyond the active intervention phase [^e8b0d66e] [^7581700d].

> For infants and toddlers under 2 years, I should confirm that evidence for obesity treatment is essentially absent. Current guidelines and reviews emphasize prevention, growth surveillance, and addressing feeding and sleep behaviors rather than structured weight-loss interventions, so clinical focus should be on risk reduction, anticipatory guidance, and linkage to early intervention services if rapid weight gain or obesity emerges, rather than applying adult-modeled behavioral weight programs [^c5786b2d] [^42b2a9b0]. Hold on, I should verify that no RCTs in this subgroup demonstrate efficacy; indeed, contemporary meta-analyses highlight the near-absence of under-3 treatment trials, reinforcing a prevention-first approach in this age band [^e987ae14].

> I need to ensure I address equity, harms, and sustainability. Available data do not suggest increased adverse events or health inequalities from early childhood obesity interventions, but dropout and implementation barriers are common, and effects often wane without maintenance strategies; therefore, programs should be culturally adapted, co-designed with families, and embedded in accessible settings such as primary care, WIC, or Head Start to improve reach and durability [^fb3e9edb] [^7581700d]. Let me double-check that guidelines emphasize nonstigmatizing, family-centered care; yes, AAP explicitly calls for a chronic-care, nonstigmatizing approach with motivational interviewing to sustain engagement [^9b63114a].

> Finally, I should summarize the bottom line and explicitly state uncertainties. The most effective behavioral approach for pediatric obesity in children under 5 years is a family-based, multicomponent intervention that integrates nutrition, physical activity, and behavior change strategies, with higher contact hours (ideally ≥ 26) over 3–12 months yielding the most consistent, albeit modest, reductions in BMI z-score in preschoolers; however, the evidence base is limited, heterogeneous, and largely extrapolated, so families should be counseled about small expected benefits, the need for sustained engagement, and the importance of early intervention to alter trajectories while recognizing that many questions about optimal components, dose, and long-term maintenance remain unanswered [^e8b0d66e] [^30ae37db] [^ccdff021] [^e987ae14].

---

The most effective behavioral interventions for pediatric obesity in children under 5 are **family-based, multicomponent programs** [^e8b0d66e] that combine nutrition, physical activity, and behavior change, with at least 26 contact hours over 3–12 months [^168befe8] [^ea9ee289]. These interventions produce **modest reductions in BMI z-score** [^e8b0d66e] and are most effective when they are culturally tailored, include parental training, and use interactive, developmentally appropriate content [^notfound]. Single-component or low-intensity programs are ineffective, and evidence for children under 2 is limited; thus, **early, sustained, family engagement is key** [^e8b0d66e] [^e987ae14].

---

## Core components of effective interventions

Effective interventions for pediatric obesity in children under 5 consistently include the following **core components**:

- **Family involvement**: Parental engagement is critical, as parents shape the child's environment, eating habits, and activity levels [^3727775d] [^3e623540].

- **Multicomponent approach**: Interventions that combine dietary, physical activity, and behavioral strategies are more effective than single-component interventions [^e8b0d66e] [^34adfb68].

- **Behavioral strategies**: Techniques such as goal setting, self-monitoring, positive reinforcement, and problem-solving are essential for sustained behavior change [^91a2d77f] [^d0937cf8].

- **Cultural tailoring**: Interventions adapted to the family's cultural context and language are more effective and better accepted [^notfound].

---

## Evidence from systematic reviews and meta-analyses

Several **systematic reviews and meta-analyses** have evaluated the effectiveness of behavioral interventions for pediatric obesity in children under 5:

| **Study** | **Intervention type** | **Outcomes** | **Effectiveness** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Cochrane review (2016) | Multicomponent interventions (diet, physical activity, behavioral) | BMI z-score reduction | Modest but significant reductions in BMI z-score (MD -0.3 to -0.4) [^e8b0d66e] |
| Cochrane review (2025) | Combined dietary and physical activity interventions | BMI and zBMI reduction | Slight reductions in BMI and zBMI at long-term follow-up [^ccdff021] |
| Systematic review (2024) | Family-based multicomponent interventions | Weight-based outcomes | Limited significant effects on child weight outcomes, but significant improvements in dietary intake [^15d1b8d2] |

---

These reviews consistently show that **multicomponent, family-based interventions** produce modest but meaningful reductions in BMI z-score and improvements in obesity-related behaviors [^e8b0d66e] [^ccdff021].

---

## Specific intervention strategies

Effective interventions employ **specific strategies** tailored to young children and their families:

- **Parental training**: Educating parents on healthy feeding practices, portion control, and positive parenting techniques [^notfound].

- **Interactive activities**: Engaging children in fun, age-appropriate physical activities and games [^notfound].

- **Environmental modifications**: Restructuring the home environment to support healthy eating and active play [^20a1fbe1].

- **Goal setting and self-monitoring**: Helping families set realistic goals and track progress [^91a2d77f].

---

## Factors influencing effectiveness

Several factors influence the **effectiveness** of behavioral interventions in this age group:

- **Age of the child**: Interventions targeting children aged 2–5 years show more consistent effects than those targeting infants and toddlers [^notfound].

- **Parental engagement**: Higher parental involvement correlates with better outcomes [^3727775d].

- **Intervention intensity**: Programs with at least 26 contact hours over 3–12 months are more effective [^168befe8] [^ea9ee289].

- **Cultural and socioeconomic factors**: Tailoring interventions to cultural and socioeconomic contexts improves adherence and effectiveness [^notfound].

---

## Limitations and gaps in current research

Despite promising findings, several **limitations and gaps** remain:

- **Limited evidence for children under 2 years**: Very few studies have evaluated interventions in infants and toddlers [^e987ae14].

- **Long-term sustainability**: Limited data on long-term maintenance of weight loss and behavior change [^7581700d].

- **Heterogeneity of interventions**: Variability in intervention components, delivery methods, and outcome measures complicates comparisons [^e1793363].

- **Lack of standardized protocols**: Absence of standardized intervention protocols limits replication and scalability [^e1793363].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current clinical guidelines emphasize the following **recommendations** for behavioral interventions in children under 5:

- **Family-based, multicomponent interventions**: Recommended as the first-line treatment for pediatric obesity in this age group [^notfound].

- **Early intervention**: Initiating interventions as early as possible yields better outcomes [^3e623540].

- **Cultural tailoring**: Interventions should be culturally sensitive and adapted to the family's context [^455ed4ab].

- **Minimum intensity**: Programs should include at least 26 contact hours over 3–12 months for optimal effectiveness [^168befe8] [^ea9ee289].

---

## Practical implications for clinicians and policymakers

Clinicians and policymakers should prioritize **family engagement**, provide culturally tailored interventions, and ensure adequate intensity and duration. They should also address **systemic barriers** — such as access to care, socioeconomic disparities, and limited resources — to improve intervention delivery and effectiveness [^10ed478c].

---

The most effective behavioral interventions for pediatric obesity in children under 5 are **family-based, multicomponent programs** that combine nutrition, physical activity, and behavior change, with at least 26 contact hours over 3–12 months. These interventions produce modest reductions in BMI z-score and improve obesity-related behaviors, especially when culturally tailored and developmentally appropriate.

Clinical Question

How effective are diet, physical activity, and behavioral interventions in treating children aged 6 to 11 years with overweight or obesity?

Bottom Line

Multicomponent behavior-changing interventions may be beneficial in achieving small, short-term reductions in body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared), body mass index z score, and weight in children aged 6 to 11 years. Adverse events, health-related quality of life, behavior change outcomes, and sociodemographics were poorly or inconsistently reported. Overall, the quality of the evidence was low or very low, with no evidence from lower-income countries.

Comprehensive, intensive behavioral interventions with at least 26 contact hours or more that include supervised physical activity sessions for up to 1 year result in weight loss in children and adolescents. 1 Effective, high-intensity behavioral interventions result in greater weight loss than less intense interventions and result in some improvements. in cardiometabolic risk factors. 1 These behavioral interventions consist of multiple components, and although components vary across interventions, many of the studied interventions include sessions targeting both the parent and child; offer group sessions in addition to individual or single-family sessions; provide information about healthy eating. safe exercising, and reading food labels; and incorporate behavior change techniques such as problem solving, monitoring diet and physical activity behaviors, and goal setting.

1 These types of interventions are often delivered by multidisciplinary teams, including pediatricians, exercise physiologists or physical therapists, dietitians or diet assistants, psychologists or social workers, or other behavioral specialists.

1. The Community Preventive Services Task Force recommends several youth interventions promoting physical activity and healthy eating, access to affordable healthy food and beverages, healthy food and beverage choices, and fostering physical activity among children, reducing sedentary screen time, and using digital health interventions for weight management. Fifty randomized clinical trials examined behavioral interventions. Twenty-eight trials were conducted in the US; the remaining 22 were conducted in Europe, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Israel, and Turkey.

Larger effects were seen in interventions with more contact hours and physical activity sessions. Although the USPSTF found no evidence to determine the individual benefits of specific intervention components, effective interventions commonly included supervised physical activity sessions; provided information about healthy eating, safe exercising, and reading food labels; and incorporated behavior change techniques such as problem solving, monitoring diet and physical activity behaviors, and goal setting. Evidence on effective interventions in children younger than 6 years is limited. 1, 10.

### Interventions for preventing obesity in children [^cacb93f0]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Prevention of childhood obesity is an international public health priority given the significant impact of obesity on acute and chronic diseases, general health, development and well-being. The international evidence base for strategies that governments, communities and families can implement to prevent obesity, and promote health, has been accumulating but remains unclear.

Objectives

This review primarily aims to update the previous Cochrane review of childhood obesity prevention research and determine the effectiveness of evaluated interventions intended to prevent obesity in children, assessed by change in Body Mass Index (BMI). Secondary aims were to examine the characteristics of the programs and strategies to answer the questions "What works for whom, why and for what cost?"

Search Methods

The searches were re-run in CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsychINFO and CINAHL in March 2010 and searched relevant websites. Non-English language papers were included and experts were contacted.

Selection Criteria

The review includes data from childhood obesity prevention studies that used a controlled study design (with or without randomisation). Studies were included if they evaluated interventions, policies or programs in place for twelve weeks or more. If studies were randomised at a cluster level, 6 clusters were required.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of included studies. Data was extracted on intervention implementation, cost, equity and outcomes. Outcome measures were grouped according to whether they measured adiposity, physical activity (PA)-related behaviours or diet-related behaviours. Adverse outcomes were recorded. A meta-analysis was conducted using available BMI or standardised BMI (zBMI) score data with subgroup analysis by age group (0–5, 6–12, 13–18 years, corresponding to stages of developmental and childhood settings).

Main Results

This review includes 55 studies (an additional 36 studies found for this update). The majority of studies targeted children aged 6–12 years. The meta-analysis included 37 studies of 27,946 children and demonstrated that programmes were effective at reducing adiposity, although not all individual interventions were effective, and there was a high level of observed heterogeneity (I² = 82%). Overall, children in the intervention group had a standardised mean difference in adiposity (measured as BMI or zBMI) of -0.15kg/m² (95% confidence interval (CI): -0.21 to -0.09). Intervention effects by age subgroups were -0.26kg/m² (95% CI:-0.53 to 0.00) (0–5 years), -0.15kg/m(2) (95% CI -0.23 to -0.08) (6–12 years), and -0.09kg/m² (95% CI -0.20 to 0.03) (13–18 years). Heterogeneity was apparent in all three age groups and could not explained by randomisation status or the type, duration or setting of the intervention. Only eight studies reported on adverse effects and no evidence of adverse outcomes such as unhealthy dieting practices, increased prevalence of underweight or body image sensitivities was found. Interventions did not appear to increase health inequalities although this was examined in fewer studies.

Authors' Conclusions

We found strong evidence to support beneficial effects of child obesity prevention programmes on BMI, particularly for programmes targeted to children aged six to 12 years. However, given the unexplained heterogeneity and the likelihood of small study bias, these findings must be interpreted cautiously. A broad range of programme components were used in these studies and whilst it is not possible to distinguish which of these components contributed most to the beneficial effects observed, our synthesis indicates the following to be promising policies and strategies:· school curriculum that includes healthy eating, physical activity and body image· increased sessions for physical activity and the development of fundamental movement skills throughout the school week· improvements in nutritional quality of the food supply in schools· environments and cultural practices that support children eating healthier foods and being active throughout each day· support for teachers and other staff to implement health promotion strategies and activities (e.g. professional development, capacity building activities)· parent support and home activities that encourage children to be more active, eat more nutritious foods and spend less time in screen based activitiesHowever, study and evaluation designs need to be strengthened, and reporting extended to capture process and implementation factors, outcomes in relation to measures of equity, longer term outcomes, potential harms and costs. Childhood obesity prevention research must now move towards identifying how effective intervention components can be embedded within health, education and care systems and achieve long term sustainable impacts.

### Interventions to prevent obesity in children aged 5 to 11 years old [^27b82491]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Prevention of obesity in children is an international public health priority given the prevalence of the condition (and its significant impact on health, development and well-being). Interventions that aim to prevent obesity involve behavioural change strategies that promote healthy eating or 'activity' levels (physical activity, sedentary behaviour and/or sleep) or both, and work by reducing energy intake and/or increasing energy expenditure, respectively. There is uncertainty over which approaches are more effective and numerous new studies have been published over the last five years, since the previous version of this Cochrane review.

Objectives

To assess the effects of interventions that aim to prevent obesity in children by modifying dietary intake or 'activity' levels, or a combination of both, on changes in BMI, zBMI score and serious adverse events.

Search Methods

We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search date was February 2023.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials in children (mean age 5 years and above but less than 12 years), comparing diet or 'activity' interventions (or both) to prevent obesity with no intervention, usual care, or with another eligible intervention, in any setting. Studies had to measure outcomes at a minimum of 12 weeks post baseline. We excluded interventions designed primarily to improve sporting performance.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods. Our outcomes were body mass index (BMI), zBMI score and serious adverse events, assessed at short- (12 weeks to < 9 months from baseline), medium- (9 months to < 15 months) and long-term (≥ 15 months) follow-up. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome.

Main Results

This review includes 172 studies (189,707 participants); 149 studies (160,267 participants) were included in meta-analyses. One hundred forty-six studies were based in high-income countries. The main setting for intervention delivery was schools (111 studies), followed by the community (15 studies), the home (eight studies) and a clinical setting (seven studies); one intervention was conducted by telehealth and 31 studies were conducted in more than one setting. Eighty-six interventions were implemented for less than nine months; the shortest was conducted over one visit and the longest over four years. Non-industry funding was declared by 132 studies; 24 studies were funded in part or wholly by industry. Dietary interventions versus control Dietary interventions, compared with control, may have little to no effect on BMI at short-term follow-up (mean difference (MD) 0, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.10 to 0.10; 5 studies, 2107 participants; low-certainty evidence) and at medium-term follow-up (MD -0.01, 95% CI -0.15 to 0.12; 9 studies, 6815 participants; low-certainty evidence) or zBMI at long-term follow-up (MD -0.05, 95% CI -0.10 to 0.01; 7 studies, 5285 participants; low-certainty evidence). Dietary interventions, compared with control, probably have little to no effect on BMI at long-term follow-up (MD -0.17, 95% CI -0.48 to 0.13; 2 studies, 945 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) and zBMI at short- or medium-term follow-up (MD -0.06, 95% CI -0.13 to 0.01; 8 studies, 3695 participants; MD -0.04, 95% CI -0.10 to 0.02; 9 studies, 7048 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Five studies (1913 participants; very low-certainty evidence) reported data on serious adverse events: one reported serious adverse events (e.g. allergy, behavioural problems and abdominal discomfort) that may have occurred as a result of the intervention; four reported no effect. Activity interventions versus control Activity interventions, compared with control, may have little to no effect on BMI and zBMI at short-term or long-term follow-up (BMI short-term: MD -0.02, 95% CI -0.17 to 0.13; 14 studies, 4069 participants; zBMI short-term: MD -0.02, 95% CI -0.07 to 0.02; 6 studies, 3580 participants; low-certainty evidence; BMI long-term: MD -0.07, 95% CI -0.24 to 0.10; 8 studies, 8302 participants; zBMI long-term: MD -0.02, 95% CI -0.09 to 0.04; 6 studies, 6940 participants; low-certainty evidence). Activity interventions likely result in a slight reduction of BMI and zBMI at medium-term follow-up (BMI: MD -0.11, 95% CI -0.18 to -0.05; 16 studies, 21,286 participants; zBMI: MD -0.05, 95% CI -0.09 to -0.02; 13 studies, 20,600 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Eleven studies (21,278 participants; low-certainty evidence) reported data on serious adverse events; one study reported two minor ankle sprains and one study reported the incident rate of adverse events (e.g. musculoskeletal injuries) that may have occurred as a result of the intervention; nine studies reported no effect. Dietary and activity interventions versus control Dietary and activity interventions, compared with control, may result in a slight reduction in BMI and zBMI at short-term follow-up (BMI: MD -0.11, 95% CI -0.21 to -0.01; 27 studies, 16,066 participants; zBMI: MD -0.03, 95% CI -0.06 to 0.00; 26 studies, 12,784 participants; low-certainty evidence) and likely result in a reduction of BMI and zBMI at medium-term follow-up (BMI: MD -0.11, 95% CI -0.21 to 0.00; 21 studies, 17,547 participants; zBMI: MD -0.05, 95% CI -0.07 to -0.02; 24 studies, 20,998 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Dietary and activity interventions compared with control may result in little to no difference in BMI and zBMI at long-term follow-up (BMI: MD 0.03, 95% CI -0.11 to 0.16; 16 studies, 22,098 participants; zBMI: MD -0.02, 95% CI -0.06 to 0.01; 22 studies, 23,594 participants; low-certainty evidence). Nineteen studies (27,882 participants; low-certainty evidence) reported data on serious adverse events: four studies reported occurrence of serious adverse events (e.g. injuries, low levels of extreme dieting behaviour); 15 studies reported no effect. Heterogeneity was apparent in the results for all outcomes at the three follow-up times, which could not be explained by the main setting of the interventions (school, home, school and home, other), country income status (high-income versus non-high-income), participants' socioeconomic status (low versus mixed) and duration of the intervention. Most studies excluded children with a mental or physical disability.

Authors' Conclusions

The body of evidence in this review demonstrates that a range of school-based 'activity' interventions, alone or in combination with dietary interventions, may have a modest beneficial effect on obesity in childhood at short- and medium-term, but not at long-term follow-up. Dietary interventions alone may result in little to no difference. Limited evidence of low quality was identified on the effect of dietary and/or activity interventions on severe adverse events and health inequalities; exploratory analyses of these data suggest no meaningful impact. We identified a dearth of evidence for home and community-based settings (e.g. delivered through local youth groups), for children living with disabilities and indicators of health inequities.

### Interventions to prevent obesity in children aged 5 to 11 years old [^354a47fc]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Prevention of obesity in children is an international public health priority given the prevalence of the condition (and its significant impact on health, development and well‐being). Interventions that aim to prevent obesity involve behavioural change strategies that promote healthy eating or 'activity' levels (physical activity, sedentary behaviour and/or sleep) or both, and work by reducing energy intake and/or increasing energy expenditure, respectively. There is uncertainty over which approaches are more effective and numerous new studies have been published over the last five years, since the previous version of this Cochrane review.

Objectives

To assess the effects of interventions that aim to prevent obesity in children by modifying dietary intake or 'activity' levels, or a combination of both, on changes in BMI, zBMI score and serious adverse events.

Search methods

We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search date was February 2023.

Selection criteria

Randomised controlled trials in children (mean age 5 years and above but less than 12 years), comparing diet or 'activity' interventions (or both) to prevent obesity with no intervention, usual care, or with another eligible intervention, in any setting. Studies had to measure outcomes at a minimum of 12 weeks post baseline. We excluded interventions designed primarily to improve sporting performance.

Data collection and analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods. Our outcomes were body mass index (BMI), zBMI score and serious adverse events, assessed at short‐ (12 weeks to < 9 months from baseline), medium‐ (9 months to < 15 months) and long‐term (≥ 15 months) follow‐up. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome.

Main results

This review includes 172 studies (189,707 participants); 149 studies (160,267 participants) were included in meta‐analyses. One hundred forty‐six studies were based in high‐income countries. The main setting for intervention delivery was schools (111 studies), followed by the community (15 studies), the home (eight studies) and a clinical setting (seven studies); one intervention was conducted by telehealth and 31 studies were conducted in more than one setting. Eighty‐six interventions were implemented for less than nine months; the shortest was conducted over one visit and the longest over four years. Non‐industry funding was declared by 132 studies; 24 studies were funded in part or wholly by industry.

Dietary interventions versus control

Dietary interventions, compared with control, may have little to no effect on BMI at short‐term follow‐up (mean difference (MD) 0, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐0.10 to 0.10; 5 studies, 2107 participants; low‐certainty evidence) and at medium‐term follow‐up (MD ‐0.01, 95% CI ‐0.15 to 0.12; 9 studies, 6815 participants; low‐certainty evidence) or zBMI at long‐term follow‐up (MD ‐0.05, 95% CI ‐0.10 to 0.01; 7 studies, 5285 participants; low‐certainty evidence). Dietary interventions, compared with control, probably have little to no effect on BMI at long‐term follow‐up (MD ‐0.17, 95% CI ‐0.48 to 0.13; 2 studies, 945 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence) and zBMI at short‐ or medium‐term follow‐up (MD ‐0.06, 95% CI ‐0.13 to 0.01; 8 studies, 3695 participants; MD ‐0.04, 95% CI ‐0.10 to 0.02; 9 studies, 7048 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence).

Five studies (1913 participants; very low‐certainty evidence) reported data on serious adverse events: one reported serious adverse events (e.g. allergy, behavioural problems and abdominal discomfort) that may have occurred as a result of the intervention; four reported no effect.

Activity interventions versus control

Activity interventions, compared with control, may have little to no effect on BMI and zBMI at short‐term or long‐term follow‐up (BMI short‐term: MD ‐0.02, 95% CI ‐0.17 to 0.13; 14 studies, 4069 participants; zBMI short‐term: MD ‐0.02, 95% CI ‐0.07 to 0.02; 6 studies, 3580 participants; low‐certainty evidence; BMI long‐term: MD ‐0.07, 95% CI ‐0.24 to 0.10; 8 studies, 8302 participants; zBMI long‐term: MD ‐0.02, 95% CI ‐0.09 to 0.04; 6 studies, 6940 participants; low‐certainty evidence). Activity interventions likely result in a slight reduction of BMI and zBMI at medium‐term follow‐up (BMI: MD ‐0.11, 95% CI ‐0.18 to ‐0.05; 16 studies, 21,286 participants; zBMI: MD ‐0.05, 95% CI ‐0.09 to ‐0.02; 13 studies, 20,600 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence).

Eleven studies (21,278 participants; low‐certainty evidence) reported data on serious adverse events; one study reported two minor ankle sprains and one study reported the incident rate of adverse events (e.g. musculoskeletal injuries) that may have occurred as a result of the intervention; nine studies reported no effect.

Dietary and activity interventions versus control

Dietary and activity interventions, compared with control, may result in a slight reduction in BMI and zBMI at short‐term follow‐up (BMI: MD ‐0.11, 95% CI ‐0.21 to ‐0.01; 27 studies, 16,066 participants; zBMI: MD ‐0.03, 95% CI ‐0.06 to 0.00; 26 studies, 12,784 participants; low‐certainty evidence) and likely result in a reduction of BMI and zBMI at medium‐term follow‐up (BMI: MD ‐0.11, 95% CI ‐0.21 to 0.00; 21 studies, 17,547 participants; zBMI: MD ‐0.05, 95% CI ‐0.07 to ‐0.02; 24 studies, 20,998 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). Dietary and activity interventions compared with control may result in little to no difference in BMI and zBMI at long‐term follow‐up (BMI: MD 0.03, 95% CI ‐0.11 to 0.16; 16 studies, 22,098 participants; zBMI: MD ‐0.02, 95% CI ‐0.06 to 0.01; 22 studies, 23,594 participants; low‐certainty evidence).

Nineteen studies (27,882 participants; low‐certainty evidence) reported data on serious adverse events: four studies reported occurrence of serious adverse events (e.g. injuries, low levels of extreme dieting behaviour); 15 studies reported no effect.

Heterogeneity was apparent in the results for all outcomes at the three follow‐up times, which could not be explained by the main setting of the interventions (school, home, school and home, other), country income status (high‐income versus non‐high‐income), participants' socioeconomic status (low versus mixed) and duration of the intervention. Most studies excluded children with a mental or physical disability.

Authors' conclusions

The body of evidence in this review demonstrates that a range of school‐based 'activity' interventions, alone or in combination with dietary interventions, may have a modest beneficial effect on obesity in childhood at short‐ and medium‐term, but not at long‐term follow‐up. Dietary interventions alone may result in little to no difference. Limited evidence of low quality was identified on the effect of dietary and/or activity interventions on severe adverse events and health inequalities; exploratory analyses of these data suggest no meaningful impact. We identified a dearth of evidence for home and community‐based settings (e.g. delivered through local youth groups), for children living with disabilities and indicators of health inequities.

### Effectiveness of behavioural and psychological interventions for managing obesity in children and adolescents: a systematic review and meta-analysis framed using minimal important difference estimates based on GRADE guidance to inform a clinical practice guideline [^13cc7d0c]. Pediatric Obesity (2025). Medium credibility.

Physical activity and multicomponent interventions showed small benefits in BMIz overall, with moderate and large benefits for 13‐18 year‐olds, respectively, and insufficient data among 0‐5 year‐olds. Technology interventions showed a small benefit for BMIz overall, with moderate benefits for 6‐12 year‐olds. Nutrition interventions showed small benefits for BMIz in children and adolescents with obesity, which is consistent with previous reviews.

Behaviour modification is the cornerstone of obesity management in children and adolescents and an essential component of care in the context of treatment intensification with pharmacotherapy or bariatric surgery. The largest body of evidence for obesity management in children and adolescents is from either multicomponent interventions (n = 22) that combined nutritional, physical activity, psychological, or technological components or RCTs that included physical activity as an exclusive intervention (n = 23). Previous systematic reviews found that multicomponent interventions were effective for improving anthropometric outcomes in the management of overweight and obesity in both childrenand adolescents. Our findings update this literature, focusing exclusively on children and adolescents with obesity, and suggest that both physical activity and multicomponent interventions exert beneficial effects on multiple outcomes, with the largest benefits among adolescents. Since most children and adolescents who enrol in obesity management programs present with obesity, our review provides relevant data for children and adolescents, their caregivers, clinicians, and decision‐makers who fund paediatric obesity health services in Canada.

4.2 Implications for research

Despite the high prevalence of obesity in children and adolescents, and the severity of metabolic and psychosocial complications, several important areas of research are lacking. Our review demonstrates the near absence of RCTs in young children, with only 3 RCTs in children between 3 and 5 years of age, and none in children under 3. Considering that ~6% of Canadian children ages 2–5 years were reported to have obesity (based on Canadian Community Health Survey data,), the lack of trials in children < 6 years of age represents an important gap in evidence. Moreover, psychosocial health is an important treatment outcome for families and clinicians and a major determinant of success in obesity treatment programs. Most RCTs did not consider outcomes such as HRQoL, symptoms of anxiety and depression, which are critically important outcomes to patients and caregivers. Adverse events related to obesity management interventions including weight stigmatization and discrimination (including by healthcare professionals) also represent an important gap in evidence for obesity management. Technology‐focused interventions in obesity management in children and adolescents are an emerging field, requiring further study of the existing broad range of technologies (e.g. wearable devices such as smartphones, watches and activity monitors). Finally, the optimal intensity, duration and combinations of components of interventions remain unknown and may have differing effects, requiring further investigation, as does the sustainability of effects beyond the period of intervention.

### Factors associated with the effectiveness of interventions to prevent obesity in children: a synthesis of evidence from 204 randomised trials [^61c916f4]. BMJ Public Health (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Rising population levels of childhood overweight and obesity present a global challenge, with profound implications for public health and health services. Children and adolescents living with obesity are more likely to experience reduced health-related quality of life and, for adolescents, a number of comorbidities. It is, therefore, important to prevent childhood obesity, both to ensure good long-term physical and mental health and to help children realise their full potential. Prevention requires effective interventions to change behaviour in relation to dietary habits and physical activity. Such behavioural change interventions typically contain multiple techniques or components, which may act individually or in combination to determine the effectiveness of the intervention.

We recently conducted two Cochrane systematic reviews of 244 randomised controlled trials of behavioural change interventions aimed at preventing obesity in children (aged 5 to 11 years and 12 to 18 years, respectively). Interventions were grouped according to whether they targeted physical activity, diet or both. While we found some modest beneficial effects, on average, of physical activity interventions, either alone or in combination with diet, there remained substantial between-trial variability in results across trials within each of the broad comparisons. This heterogeneity is most likely caused by variation in the characteristics of interventions included in each category. The characteristics varied in many different dimensions, including whether they targeted diet or physical activity or both, the degree of home (family) engagement, the degree of active participation by the children, the number of different strategies employed concurrently, the mode of delivery, the intensity and the duration.

In this paper, we report results of a re-analysis of these trials using all types of BMI outcomes reported, age groups (5–18 years) and follow-up times in a single comprehensive analysis. Our aim is to identify characteristics of these behavioural change interventions that are most strongly associated with their effectiveness in preventing obesity in children. We employ an analytic framework co-produced with stakeholders, statistical methods for mapping different outcomes onto a single measurement scaleand a bespoke complex meta-regression model.

### Early childhood (1–5 years) obesity prevention: a systematic review of family-based multicomponent behavioral interventions [^15d1b8d2]. Preventive Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Globally 38.9 million children under age 5 have overweight or obesity, leading to type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular complications, depression, and poor educational outcomes. Obesity is difficult to reverse and lifestyle behaviors (healthy or unhealthy) can persist from 1.5 years of age. Targeting caregivers to help address modifiable behaviors may offer a viable solution.

Objective

Evaluate the impact of multicomponent family interventions on weight-based outcomes in early childhood and explore related secondary behavior outcomes.

Methods

Four databases were searched (1/2017–6/2022) for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of obesity-prevention interventions for children (1–5 years). Eligible studies included an objectively measured weight-based outcome, family interventions targeting the caregiver or family, and interventions including at least two behavioral components of nutrition, physical activity, or sleep.

Results

Eleven interventions were identified consisting of four delivery modes: self-guided (n = 3), face-to-face group instruction (n = 3), face-to-face home visits (n = 2), and multiple levels of influence (n = 3). The reviewed studies reported almost no significant effects on child weight-based outcomes. Only two studies (one was an underpowered pilot study) resulted in significant positive child weight-management outcomes. Seven of the interventions significantly improved children's dietary intake.

Conclusion

Except for one, the reviewed studies reported that family based interventions had no significant effects on child weight-based outcomes. Future studies of this type should include measurements of age and sex-based body mass index (BMI) and trajectories, and also examine other important benefits to the children and families.

### Parent-only interventions for childhood overweight or obesity in children aged 5 to 11 years [^d830e265]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Child and adolescent overweight and obesity have increased globally, and are associated with short- and long-term health consequences.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy of diet, physical activity and behavioural interventions delivered to parents only for the treatment of overweight and obesity in children aged 5 to 11 years.

Search Methods

We performed a systematic literature search of databases including the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL and LILACS as well trial registers. We checked references of identified trials and systematic reviews. We applied no language restrictions. The date of the last search was March 2015 for all databases.

Selection Criteria

We selected randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of diet, physical activity and behavioural interventions delivered to parents only for treating overweight or obesity in children aged 5 to 11 years.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trials for risk of bias and evaluated overall study quality using the GRADE instrument. Where necessary, we contacted authors for additional information.

Main Results

We included 20 RCTs, including 3057 participants. The number of participants ranged per trial between 15 and 645. Follow-up ranged between 24 weeks and two years. Eighteen trials were parallel RCTs and two were cluster RCTs. Twelve RCTs had two comparisons and eight RCTs had three comparisons. The interventions varied widely; the duration, content, delivery and follow-up of the interventions were heterogeneous. The comparators also differed. This review categorised the comparisons into four groups: parent-only versus parent-child, parent-only versus waiting list controls, parent-only versus minimal contact interventions and parent-only versus other parent-only interventions. Trial quality was generally low with a large proportion of trials rated as high risk of bias on individual risk of bias criteria. In trials comparing a parent-only intervention with a parent-child intervention, the body mass index (BMI) z score change showed a mean difference (MD) at the longest follow-up period (10 to 24 months) of -0.04 (95% confidence interval (CI) -0.15 to 0.08); P = 0.56; 267 participants; 3 trials; low quality evidence. In trials comparing a parent-only intervention with a waiting list control, the BMI z score change in favour of the parent-only intervention at the longest follow-up period (10–12 months) had an MD of -0.10 (95% CI -0.19 to -0.01); P = 0.04; 136 participants; 2 trials; low quality evidence. BMI z score change of parent-only interventions when compared with minimal contact control interventions at the longest follow-up period (9 to 12 months) showed an MD of 0.01 (95% CI -0.07 to 0.09); P = 0.81; 165 participants; 1 trial; low quality evidence. There were few similarities between interventions and comparators across the included trials in the parent-only intervention versus other parent-only interventions and we did not pool these data. Generally, these trials did not show substantial differences between their respective parent-only groups on BMI outcomes. Other outcomes such as behavioural measures, parent-child relationships and health-related quality of life were reported inconsistently. Adverse effects of the interventions were generally not reported, two trials stated that there were no serious adverse effects. No trials reported on all-cause mortality, morbidity or socioeconomic effects. All results need to be interpreted cautiously because of their low quality, the heterogeneous interventions and comparators, and the high rates of non-completion.

Authors' Conclusions

Parent-only interventions may be an effective treatment option for overweight or obese children aged 5 to 11 years when compared with waiting list controls. Parent-only interventions had similar effects compared with parent-child interventions and compared with those with minimal contact controls. However, the evidence is at present limited; some of the trials had a high risk of bias with loss to follow-up being a particular issue and there was a lack of evidence for several important outcomes. The systematic review has identified 10 ongoing trials that have a parent-only arm, which will contribute to future updates. These trials will improve the robustness of the analyses by type of comparator, and may permit subgroup analysis by intervention component and the setting. Trial reports should provide adequate details about the interventions to be replicated by others. There is a need to conduct and report cost-effectiveness analyses in future trials in order to establish whether parent-only interventions are more cost-effective than parent-child interventions.

### Clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and treatment of children and adolescents with obesity [^ea9ee289]. Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

D.1 Evidence for effectiveness — intensive behavioral interventions for pediatric obesity show significant BMI reduction in high-quality randomized and nonrandomized studies, with the 2017 USPSTF review through January 2016 (n = 42) and an added systematic review (March 2020) including 214 total intervention studies, of which 126 were randomized lifestyle studies. Dose is clearly the factor most strongly correlated with treatment outcomes, with effective trials delivering "high intensity" and "comprehensive" contact over a 2- to 12-month or 3- to 12-month time period. In research settings simulating clinical practice, intensive behavioral intervention lowers child BMI, reduces comorbidities, and improves quality of life, and interventions providing more than 26 hours of treatment are associated with BMI z-score reductions between −0.10 and −0.53 or weight loss ranging from −1.6 to −8.1 kg (3.5 to 18 lb) over 1 year.

### Behavioral interventions for obesity in children and adults: evidence base, novel approaches, and translation into practice [^2bac82ea]. The American Psychologist (2018). Low credibility.

Obesity in adults has nearly doubled in the past 30 years and has risen similarly in children and adolescents. Obesity affects all systems of the body, and the serious health consequences of obesity include an increased risk for cardiovascular disease, such as Type 2 diabetes or high blood pressure, which are occurring at ever younger ages. The present article introduces traditional behavioral weight loss strategies designed to change energy-balance behaviors (i.e., dietary and physical activity behaviors) and the contexts within which these interventions have typically been delivered. The applicability of findings from behavioral economics, cognitive processing, and clinical research that may lead to more potent weight loss and weight loss maintenance interventions are also considered. Given the pervasiveness of obesity, this article concludes with a discussion of efforts toward wider scale dissemination and implementation of behavioral treatments designed to address obesity and to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.

### Effectiveness of behavioural and psychological interventions for managing obesity in children and adolescents: a systematic review and meta-analysis framed using minimal important difference estimates based on GRADE guidance to inform a clinical practice guideline [^47e8441f]. Pediatric Obesity (2025). Medium credibility.

Effective interventions to manage paediatric obesity are crucial in reducing potential individual and societal health and the economic consequences of obesity in childhood and adulthood. Behavioural and psychological interventions are the foundation of obesity management in children and adolescentsand often include individual or multiple components designed to improve nutrition, movement behaviours (e.g. physical and sedentary activities) and psychological well‐being, with many interventions utilizing technology to optimize reach and uptake.

In 2015, the Canadian Task Force on Preventative Health Care (CTFPHC) completed a systematic review on managing overweight and obesity in 2‐17 year‐olds. Findings from this research yielded moderate certainty evidence, which led to a weak recommendation that primary care practitioners should offer or refer children and adolescents with overweight and obesity to structured behavioural interventions for weight management. Since that time, a substantial amount of evidence has accumulated regarding the effects of behavioural and psychological interventions for managing paediatric obesity. Systematic reviews and meta‐analyses have been published in recent years, with most focused on anthropometric outcomes to evaluate intervention effectiveness. Previous reviews documented low‐to‐moderate certainty of evidence (CoE) from randomized controlled trials (RCTs), suggesting that behavioural and psychological interventions led to modest reductions in BMI and BMI z ‐score (BMIz) in < 6 year‐oldsbased on very limited evidence, modest reductions in 6 to 11 year‐olds, with larger effects in 12 to 17 year‐olds. Evidence on the effectiveness of behavioural and psychological interventions on other outcomes, including psychosocial, and cardiometabolic outcomes, have also emerged, although data are limited and results have been inconsistent.

Key Points

Question

What is the association of physical activity, dietary interventions, supplements, behavioral strategies, and pharmacological treatments, either individually or in combination, with childhood central obesity?

Findings

In this systematic review and meta-analysis of 34 randomized clinical trials with 8183 participants, combining dietary changes with physical activity, as well as standalone behavioral interventions, was associated with significantly reduced central obesity.

Meaning

These results suggest that integrating dietary modifications with physical activity and other behavioral strategies holds promise for reducing central obesity in children.

Abstract

Introduction

We aim to identify effective characteristics of behavioural change (physical activity and diet) interventions that prevent obesity in children aged 5 to 18 years.

Methods

We re-analysed data from two Cochrane systematic reviews published in 2024 using a Bayesian multi-level meta-regression analysis with intervention and trial characteristics coded according to an analytic framework co-developed with stakeholders.

Results

We included 204 trials (255 intervention arms) reporting data on body mass index (BMI), either unstandardised or measured as a z-score (zBMI) or percentile. Interventions were effective on average (MD in zBMI −0.037, 95% credible interval −0.053 to −0.022). The greatest effects were associated with medium-term follow-up (nine to < 15 months) and older children (12 to 18 years). We found evidence of small beneficial effects for interventions targeting physical activity alone compared with diet alone (difference in MDs −0.227,–0.362 to −0.090) and small unfavourable effects for interventions that involved a change to the structural environment (typically the school food environment) (difference in MDs 0.05, 0.017 to 0.085). Accounting for interactions between covariates, the most effective combination of intervention characteristics was to intervene in the school setting, with an individualised element to delivery, targeting physical activity, using multiple strategies of short duration and high intensity and involving modification of behaviour through participation in activities.

Conclusions

The most effective characteristic to include in a behavioural change intervention to prevent obesity in children aged 5–18 years was targeting of physical activity. This should not be interpreted as evidence that attempts to modify diet are not beneficial. Being physically active and consuming a healthy diet during childhood offer many important benefits beyond contributing to healthy weight and growth. Our findings suggest that interventions to prevent obesity in children should consider increasing their focus on the promotion of physical activity and consider other effective characteristics we identify here.

### Clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and treatment of children and adolescents with obesity [^168befe8]. Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Intensive health behavior and lifestyle treatment (IHB LT) — effective dose and body mass index (BMI) outcomes: For children aged 6 years and older with overweight and obesity, the most consistently effective programs deliver 26 or more hours of face-to-face, family-based counseling on nutrition and physical activity, with more limited evidence for children 2 to 5 years of age. A threshold effect was observed at 26 or more hours over a 3- to 12-month period; interventions that delivered ≥ 52 hours of contact over the same duration demonstrated the most consistent and significant reduction in BMI and cardiometabolic comorbidity improvement. As described in the technical report, 28% of treatments < 5 hours, 38% of treatments 5 to 25 hours, and 75% of treatments ≥ 26 hours led to significant improvements in BMI among pediatric participants.

### Clinical review: behavioral interventions to prevent childhood obesity: a systematic review and metaanalyses of randomized trials [^965a5826]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2008). Low credibility.

Context

The efficacy of lifestyle interventions to encourage healthy lifestyle behaviors to prevent pediatric obesity remains unclear.

Objective

Our objective was to summarize evidence on the efficacy of interventions aimed at changing lifestyle behaviors (increased physical activity, decreased sedentary activity, increased healthy dietary habits, and decreased unhealthy dietary habits) to prevent obesity.

Data Sources

Data sources included librarian-designed searches of nine electronic databases, references from included studies and reviews (from inception until February 2006), and content expert recommendations.

Study Selection

Eligible studies were randomized trials enrolling children and adolescents assessing the impact of interventions on both lifestyle behaviors and body mass index (BMI).

Data Extraction

Two reviewers independently abstracted data on methodological quality, study characteristics, intervention components, and treatment effects.

Data Analysis

We conducted random-effects metaanalyses, quantified inconsistency using I(2), and conducted planned subgroup analyses for each examined outcome.

Data Synthesis

Regarding target behaviors, the pooled effect size for physical activity (22 comparisons; n = 9891 participants) was 0.12 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.04–0.20; I² = 63%], for sedentary activity (14 comparisons; n = 3003) was -0.29, (CI = -0.35 to -0.22; I² = 0%), for healthy dietary habits (14 comparisons, n = 5468) was 0.00 (CI = -0.20; 0.20; I(2) = 83%), and for unhealthy dietary habits (23 comparisons, n = 9578) was -0.20 (CI = -0.31 to -0.09; I² = 34%). The effect of these interventions on BMI (43 comparisons, n = 32,003) was trivial (-0.02; CI = -0.06–0.02; I² = 17%) compared with control. Trials with interventions lasting more than 6 months (vs. shorter trials) and trials with postintervention outcomes (vs. in-treatment outcomes) yielded marginally larger effects.

Conclusion

Pediatric obesity prevention programs caused small changes in target behaviors and no significant effect on BMI compared with control. Trials evaluating promising interventions applied over a long period, using responsive outcomes, with longer measurement timeframes are urgently needed.

### What to know… [^61a93bc4]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

What to know Many professional associations offer evidence-based guidelines for comprehensive care for children with obesity. The guidelines include obesity screening and referral to effective obesity interventions. These guidelines inform pediatricians and other pediatric health care providers about the standard of care for screening, evaluating, and treating obesity and related chronic diseases.
- Measure height and weight.
- Calculate body mass index.
- Assess BMI percentile using age- and sex-specific CDC growth charts. The AAP CPG also provides guidelines on how to treat and manage obesity. This includes guidelines for offering or referring patients to intensive health behavior and lifestyle treatment. Weight stigma.

US Preventive Services Taskforce In 2017, the USPSTF recommended that clinicians:

- Screen for obesity in children and adolescents 6 years and older, and
- Offer or refer them to comprehensive, intensive behavioral interventions to promote improvements in weight status. This recommendation was Grade B. This means there was moderate certainty that the net benefit was moderate. USPSTF found no direct evidence of harm in screening for obesity. This recommendation was based on a thorough evidence review of behavioral interventions for obesity targeting lifestyle change. Other organizations American Psychological Association In 2018, the association released the Clinical Practice Guideline for Multicomponent Behavioral Treatment of Obesity and Overweight in Children and Adolescents. This CPG strongly supported the use of family-based multicomponent behavioral interventions with at least 26 contact hours for children and adolescents 2–18 with overweight and obesity.

Pediatric Endocrine Society In 2017, the society convened a task force of experts who released a clinical practice guideline titled Pediatric Obesity- Assessment, Treatment, and Prevention.

### Clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and treatment of children and adolescents with obesity [^34adfb68]. Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Childhood obesity — multicomponent behavioral interventions — Effective programs 'incorporated many nutrition, physical activity, and behavior change strategies simultaneously', whereas 'Single-component interventions, such as physical activity alone, were generally not successful', and narrow targets such as 'consumption of 5 fruits and vegetables a day' were unlikely to affect weight or BMI. Most successful interventions used 'nutrition counseling without a structured diet', with exceptions where low and modified carbohydrate diets and beverage-only or multiple-nutrition-focus strategies were 'both superior to control but not different from each other', and adolescent studies that included 'caloric restriction of 1300 to 1550 calories per day' plus activity and behavior strategies; additionally, 'Two small studies found benefit from interventions that reduced glycemic load'. Although specific strategies show limited weight-outcome evidence, they have 'clear health benefits' and were components of RCTs, and 'pediatricians and other PHCPs can appropriately encourage families to adopt these strategies'.

USPSTF supporting evidence scope — what was reviewed and what was excluded: The USPSTF "commissioned a systematic evidence review to update its 2017 recommendation on screening for obesity in children and adolescents", and "because assessing BMI is now part of routine clinical practice, it was not a focus of this review". The USPSTF "reviewed evidence on interventions (behavioral counseling and pharmacotherapy) for weight loss or weight management that can be provided in or referred from a primary care setting", and "interventions that did not include a weight loss or weight management component were not eligible for inclusion". "Surgical weight loss interventions are generally not first-line preventive interventions and are outside the scope of the review".

### Recommendations for prevention of childhood obesity [^6f065397]. Pediatrics (2007). Low credibility.

The majority of US youth are of healthy weight, but the majority of US adults are overweight or obese. Therefore, a major health challenge for most American children and adolescents is obesity prevention-today, and as they age into adulthood. In this report, we review the most recent evidence regarding many behavioral and practice interventions related to childhood obesity, and we present recommendations to health care providers. Because of the importance, we also suggest approaches that clinicians can use to encourage obesity prevention among children, including specific counseling strategies and practice-based, systems-level interventions. In addition, we suggest how clinicians may interact with and promote local and state policy initiatives designed to prevent obesity in their communities.

### Prevention of obesity in infancy and early childhood: a National Institutes of Health workshop [^42b2a9b0]. JAMA Pediatrics (2015). Medium credibility.

Addressing the childhood obesity epidemic continues to be a challenge. Given that once obesity develops it is likely to persist, there has been an increasing focus on prevention at earlier stages of the life course. Research to develop and implement effective prevention and intervention strategies in the first 2 years after birth has been limited. In fall 2013, the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases convened a multidisciplinary workshop to summarize the current state of knowledge regarding the prevention of infant and early childhood obesity and to identify research gaps and opportunities. The questions addressed included (1) "What is known regarding risk for excess weight gain in infancy and early childhood?" (2) "What is known regarding interventions that are promising or have been shown to be efficacious?" and (3) "What are the challenges and opportunities in implementing and evaluating behavioral interventions for parents and other caregivers and their young children?"

### Effectiveness of behavioural and psychological interventions for managing obesity in children and adolescents: a systematic review and meta-analysis framed using minimal important difference estimates based on GRADE guidance to inform a clinical practice guideline [^4db125d0]. Pediatric Obesity (2025). Medium credibility.

3.3.2 Body Mass Index

We were unable to determine an MID estimate for body mass index. Physical activity interventions (versus usual care) reduced absolute BMI (kg/m 2) (MD −1.12 95% CI −2.04 to −0.21, 18 RCTs, Table 2, Figure S2.54) based on low CoE (Table S2). Compared with usual care, nutrition (MD −1.30 95% CI −2.37 to −0.21, 3 RCTs, Table 3, Figure S2.55) and psychological (MD −0.59 95% CI −1.12 to −0.06, 5 RCTs, Table 4, Figure S2.56) interventions reduced BMI with moderate CoE (Tables S3 and S4), and technology interventions (versus usual care) reduced BMI (MD −1.27 95% CI −3.46 to 0.89, 6 RCTs, Table 5, Figure S2.57) based on low CoE (Table S5) with a larger reduction in 6 to 12 year‐olds in subgroup analyses (MD −3.81 95% CI −6.59 to −1.01, 2 RCTs, Table 5). Multicomponent interventions (versus usual care) reduced BMI (MD −2.10 95% CI −3.81 to −0.36, 12 RCTs, Table 6, Figure S2.58) with moderate CoE (Table S6).

### Clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and treatment of children and adolescents with obesity [^455ed4ab]. Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Childhood obesity — treatment duration and age scope indicate that evidence was evaluated over a 3- to 12-month period requiring a weight-specific outcome at least 3 months after the intervention started, and treatments longer than 12 months are likely to have additional and sustained benefit. For children 2 to 18 years of age with overweight and obesity, the USPSTF identified evidence for intensive "lifestyle" treatments starting at age 6 years, and this KAS includes children down to age 2 with studies showing effectiveness in preschoolers 2 to 5 years of age. Delivery commonly varies by age, with preschool-focused studies more often using home visits and parental skills training and adolescent-focused studies more often emphasizing autonomy, preferences, and self-image; intensive behavioral interventions should be tailored to the child's developmental abilities and learning skills.

### Family-based behavioral treatment for childhood obesity… [^78a64442]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

Question How effective is family-based behavioral treatment for childhood overweight and obesity when implemented in pediatric primary care settings. Finding In this randomized trial with follow-up over 24 months, children, parents, and siblings with overweight or obesity assigned to undergo family-based treatment had significantly better weight loss outcomes, measured by percentage above the median body mass index for their age and sex, than those assigned to undergo usual care. Meaning Family-based treatment can be successfully implemented in pediatric primary care settings and leads to improved weight loss outcomes among participating children and their parents and siblings. Importance Intensive behavioral interventions for childhood overweight and obesity are recommended by national guidelines, but are currently offered primarily in specialty clinics. Evidence is lacking on their effectiveness in pediatric primary care settings.

Interventions Family-based treatment used a variety of behavioral techniques to develop healthy eating, physical activity, and parenting behaviors within families. The treatment goal was 26 sessions over a 24-month period with a coach trained in behavior change methods; the number of sessions was individualized based on family progress. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was the child's change from baseline to 24 months in the percentage above the median body mass index in the general US population normalized for age and sex. Secondary outcomes were the changes in this measure for siblings and in BMI for parents. At 24 months, children receiving family-based treatment had better weight outcomes than those receiving usual care based on the difference in change in percentage above median BMI.

This randomized clinical trial found that family-based treatment for childhood overweight and obesity could be successfully implemented in pediatric primary care settings. The intervention led to improved weight outcomes over 24 months for children. In addition, family-based treatment had similar benefits for parents and for siblings who were not directly treated, beginning at 6 months and continuing through 24-month follow-up. This study goes beyond previous research in that it adapted the family-based treatment intervention for use in primary care settings. Previous studies of intensive behavioral interventions, and subsequent implementation efforts in many US settings, have been based in specialty clinics. In this study, persons without prior skills in implementing behavior change were successfully trained to deliver the intervention in pediatric primary care settings.

These findings may suggest a way for more clinical groups to implement national recommendations by the American Academy of Pediatrics8 and the US Preventive Services Task Force23 to offer intensive behavioral interventions for childhood overweight and obesity.

### Interventions to prevent obesity in 0–5 year olds: an updated systematic review of the literature [^f8cde924]. Obesity (2010). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

The small number and recency of the early childhood obesity-prevention literature identified in a previous review of interventions to prevent obesity, promote healthy eating, physical activity, and/or reduce sedentary behaviors in 0–5 year olds suggests this is a new and developing research area. The current review was conducted to provide an update of the rapidly emerging evidence in this area and to assess the quality of studies reported. Ten electronic databases were searched to identify literature published from January 1995 to August 2008.

Inclusion Criteria

interventions reporting child anthropometric, diet, physical activity, or sedentary behavior outcomes and focusing on children aged 0–5 years of age.

Exclusion Criteria

focusing on breastfeeding, eating disorders, obesity treatment, malnutrition, or school-based interventions. Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed study quality. Twenty-three studies met all criteria. Most were conducted in preschool/childcare (n = 9) or home settings (n = 8). Approximately half targeted socioeconomically disadvantaged children (n = 12) and three quarters were published from 2003 onward (n = 17). The interventions varied widely although most were multifaceted in their approach. While study design and quality varied most studies reported their interventions were feasible and acceptable, although impact on behaviors that contribute to obesity were not achieved by all. Early childhood obesity-prevention interventions represent a rapidly growing research area. Current evidence suggests that behaviors that contribute to obesity can be positively impacted in a range of settings and provides important insights into the most effective strategies for promoting healthy weight from early childhood.

### Interventions for high body mass index in children and adolescents: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^d986c8c4]. JAMA (2024). Excellent credibility.

US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) research needs for interventions for high body mass index (BMI) in children and adolescents emphasize generating evidence on long-term health outcomes (at least 2 years) and benefits of behavioral and pharmacotherapy interventions, with studies including weight/BMI, cardiometabolic, psychosocial, and dietary outcomes and prioritizing populations with a high prevalence of high BMI, including Hispanic/Latino, Native, American/Alaska Native, and non-Hispanic Black children and adolescents. The USPSTF notes research is needed on long-term (at least 2 years) psychosocial harms of pharmacotherapy and on the benefits and harms of healthy lifestyle, or weight-neutral, interventions in children and adolescents with a high BMI. It also identifies needs to determine the best timing for interventions during childhood and adolescence, to assess maintenance of weight loss and long-term (> 5 y) benefits and harms after behavioral interventions, and to define best practices for weight-related discussions with children and adolescents and their families.

### Executive summary: clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and treatment of children and adolescents with obesity [^9b63114a]. Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Key Action Statements (KAS) for treatment approach and behavioral interventions: Pediatricians and other PHCPs should treat children and adolescents for overweight or obesity and comorbidities concurrently. Pediatricians and other PHCPs should treat overweight and obesity in children and adolescents using a family-centered and nonstigmatizing approach that acknowledges obesity's biologic, social, and structural drivers and follows the principles of the medical home and chronic care model. Pediatricians and other PHCPs should use motivational interviewing (MI) to engage patients and families. Pediatricians and other PHCPs should provide or refer children 6 y and older and may provide or refer children 2 through 5 y of age with overweight and obesity to intensive health behavior and lifestyle treatment, with the most effective treatment including 26 or more hours of face-to-face, family-based, multicomponent treatment over a 3- to 12-mo period.

### Clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and treatment of children and adolescents with obesity [^30ae37db]. Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

KAS 11 — intensive health behavior and lifestyle treatment for pediatric overweight and obesity states that pediatricians and other PHCPs should provide or refer children 6 y and older (Grade B) and may provide or refer children 2 through 5 y of age (Grade C) with overweight (BMI ≥ 85th percentile to < 95th percentile) and obesity (BMI ≥ 95th percentile) to intensive health behavior and lifestyle treatment; treatment is more effective with greater contact hours, and the most effective treatment includes 26 or more hours of face-to-face, family-based, multicomponent treatment over 3 to 12 mo, with benefits of BMI reduction, quality of life improvement, and comorbidity improvement or resolution, minimal risk or harm, but participation is time-intensive, requires repeated visits, and treatment is costly to administer and inconsistently paid.

### Obesity prevention and obesogenic behavior interventions in child care: a systematic review [^bc4c0757]. Preventive Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

Review peer-reviewed interventions designed to reduce obesity and improve obesogenic behaviors, including physical activity, diet, and screen time, at child care centers. Interventions components and outcomes, study design, duration, use of behavioral theory, and level of social ecological influence are detailed.

Methods

Article searches were conducted from March 2014, October 2014, March 2015, January 2016 across three databases. Eligible interventions were conducted in child care settings, included 3-to-5-year-old children, included an outcome measure of obesity or obesogenic behavior, and published in English. Study design quality was assessed using Stetler's Level of Quantitative Evidence.

Results

All unique records were screened (n = 4589): 237 articles were assessed for eligibility. Of these, 97 articles describing 71 interventions met inclusion criteria. Forty-four articles included multi-level interventions. Twenty-nine interventions included an outcome measure of obesity. Forty-one interventions included physical activity. Forty-five included diet. Eight included screen time. Fifty-five percent of interventions were Level II (randomized controlled trials), while 37% were Level III (quasi-experimental or pre-post only study design), and 8% were Level IV (non-experimental or natural experiments). Most interventions had the intended effect on the target: obesity 48% (n = 14), physical activity 73% (n = 30), diet 87% (n = 39), and screen time 63% (n = 5).

Conclusion

Summarizing intervention strategies and assessing their effectiveness contributes to the existing literature and may provide direction for practitioners and researchers working with young children in child care. Most interventions produced the targeted changes in obesity and obesity-associated behaviors, supporting current and future efforts to collaborate with early-care centers and professionals for obesity prevention.

### Effectiveness of behavioural and psychological interventions for managing obesity in children and adolescents: a systematic review and meta-analysis framed using minimal important difference estimates based on GRADE guidance to inform a clinical practice guideline [^a3491aae]. Pediatric Obesity (2025). Medium credibility.

While examining the impacts of intervention dose and intensity were beyond the scope of our review, our narrative synthesis suggests that higher intensity interventions appeared to support more favourable outcomes compared to lower intensity treatments. This is consistent with the available evidence that suggests strong benefits of paediatric obesity management interventions that are delivered with medium to high intensity, including ≥ 26 hours of contact over the initial 6–12 months of treatment. We also identified that nutrition interventions varied substantially in terms of suggested dietary intake (e.g. low‐glycaemic index, low‐fat, plant‐based) and enrolled populations (e.g. various ethnic groups, severity of obesity). Overall, for all intervention types, age, sex and gender, and cultural appropriateness emerged as important considerations for the development of future interventions.

Few studies of any intervention type reported on post‐intervention follow‐up, and in the multicomponent interventions that did, we found no evidence of sustained benefits on any anthropometric outcome over time in comparison with usual care. No studies examined sustained benefits to other outcomes. This may be due to the substantial heterogeneity across studies in terms of post‐intervention follow‐up, but likely is linked to the limited number of studies that collected data for an extended period post‐intervention. Nonetheless, this absence of sustained benefits is particularly relevant for clinical practice and obesity management service planning since obesity is a chronic condition. Identifying interventions that offer long‐term benefits in children and adolescents could have significant impacts on child, adolescent and adult health. While exploring strategies to maintain sustainability of behavioural and psychological modifications after cessation of the intervention remains important, it is likely that behavioural and psychological interventions need to be sustained over time, similar to medical management (such as pharmacotherapy) for any other chronic condition.

There were limited data on adverse events in the published trials. Likewise, trial evidence for obesity management in children < 6 years‐old was very limited. This lack of evidence limits our ability to make confident conclusions for infants or toddlers with obesity.

### Appraisal of clinical care practices for child obesity treatment. part I: interventions [^10636e2c]. Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Comparative effectiveness trials for pediatric obesity interventions indicate that the USPSTF 2018 report only included trials with a minimal or control comparator arm, and that higher-intensity interventions with more contact hours typically produced greater weight loss but no specific components consistently explained stronger effects. More comparative effectiveness trials are required to identify critical ingredients of lifestyle or diet interventions, compare pharmaceutical versus lifestyle versus surgical approaches and combinations, and assess whether some approaches are more effective among certain populations. Interpretation is challenging without an established margin of equivalence, such as what constitutes a meaningful difference in body mass index (BMI) change between the 2 comparator arms, or a threshold for a clinically meaningful reduction in BMI or BMI SDS.

### Appraisal of clinical care practices for child obesity treatment. part I: interventions [^e1793363]. Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Childhood obesity interventions — published intervention studies often provided limited information about the dose, duration, and specifics of intervention components and implementation procedures; this lack of detail significantly limits the opportunity to inform recommendations in practice. More details are needed on effective intervention content, behavior change techniques, and efforts to improve retention and family motivation, and drilling down to the essential ingredients of an effective lifestyle or diet intervention and how those components affect comorbidities is important so that providers can focus on the critical content, particularly when faced with limited contact hours due to transportation or scheduling barriers or limited personnel, resources, and financial constraints.

### Diet, physical activity and behavioural interventions for the treatment of overweight or obese children from the age of 6 to 11 years [^471b79bc]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Child and adolescent overweight and obesity has increased globally, and can be associated with significant short- and long-term health consequences. This is an update of a Cochrane review published first in 2003, and updated previously in 2009. However, the update has now been split into six reviews addressing different childhood obesity treatments at different ages.

Objectives

To assess the effects of diet, physical activity and behavioural interventions (behaviour-changing interventions) for the treatment of overweight or obese children aged 6 to 11 years.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS as well as trial registers ClinicalTrials.gov and ICTRP Search Portal. We checked references of studies and systematic reviews. We did not apply any language restrictions. The date of the last search was July 2016 for all databases.

Selection Criteria

We selected randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of diet, physical activity, and behavioural interventions (behaviour-changing interventions) for treating overweight or obese children aged 6 to 11 years, with a minimum of six months' follow-up. We excluded interventions that specifically dealt with the treatment of eating disorders or type 2 diabetes, or included participants with a secondary or syndromic cause of obesity.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened references, extracted data, assessed risk of bias, and evaluated the quality of the evidence using the GRADE instrument. We contacted study authors for additional information. We carried out meta-analyses according to the statistical guidelines in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions.

Main Results

We included 70 RCTs with a total of 8461 participants randomised to either the intervention or control groups. The number of participants per trial ranged from 16 to 686. Fifty-five trials compared a behaviour-changing intervention with no treatment/usual care control and 15 evaluated the effectiveness of adding an additional component to a behaviour-changing intervention. Sixty-four trials were parallel RCTs, and four were cluster RCTs. Sixty-four trials were multicomponent, two were diet only and four were physical activity only interventions. Ten trials had more than two arms. The overall quality of the evidence was low or very low and 62 trials had a high risk of bias for at least one criterion. Total duration of trials ranged from six months to three years. The median age of participants was 10 years old and the median BMI z score was 2.2. Primary analyses demonstrated that behaviour-changing interventions compared to no treatment/usual care control at longest follow-up reduced BMI, BMI z score and weight. Mean difference (MD) in BMI was -0.53 kg/m 2 (95% confidence interval (CI) -0.82 to -0.24); P < 0.00001; 24 trials; 2785 participants; low-quality evidence. MD in BMI z score was -0.06 units (95% CI -0.10 to -0.02); P = 0.001; 37 trials; 4019 participants; low-quality evidence and MD in weight was -1.45 kg (95% CI -1.88 to -1.02); P < 0.00001; 17 trials; 1774 participants; low-quality evidence. Thirty-one trials reported on serious adverse events, with 29 trials reporting zero occurrences RR 0.57 (95% CI 0.17 to 1.93); P = 0.37; 4/2105 participants in the behaviour-changing intervention groups compared with 7/1991 participants in the comparator groups). Few trials reported health-related quality of life or behaviour change outcomes, and none of the analyses demonstrated a substantial difference in these outcomes between intervention and control. In two trials reporting on minutes per day of TV viewing, a small reduction of 6.6 minutes per day (95% CI -12.88 to -0.31), P = 0.04; 2 trials; 55 participants) was found in favour of the intervention. No trials reported on all-cause mortality, morbidity or socioeconomic effects, and few trials reported on participant views; none of which could be meta-analysed. As the meta-analyses revealed substantial heterogeneity, we conducted subgroup analyses to examine the impact of type of comparator, type of intervention, risk of attrition bias, setting, duration of post-intervention follow-up period, parental involvement and baseline BMI z score. No subgroup effects were shown for any of the subgroups on any of the outcomes. Some data indicated that a reduction in BMI immediately post-intervention was no longer evident at follow-up at less than six months, which has to be investigated in further trials.

Authors' Conclusions

Multi-component behaviour-changing interventions that incorporate diet, physical activity and behaviour change may be beneficial in achieving small, short-term reductions in BMI, BMI z score and weight in children aged 6 to 11 years. The evidence suggests a very low occurrence of adverse events. The quality of the evidence was low or very low. The heterogeneity observed across all outcomes was not explained by subgrouping. Further research is required of behaviour-changing interventions in lower income countries and in children from different ethnic groups; also on the impact of behaviour-changing interventions on health-related quality of life and comorbidities. The sustainability of reduction in BMI/BMI z score and weight is a key consideration and there is a need for longer-term follow-up and further research on the most appropriate forms of post-intervention maintenance in order to ensure intervention benefits are sustained over the longer term.

### Interventions for reducing childhood obesity… [^29a381ae]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

Clinical Question Do dietary and physical activity interventions reduce obesity rates in children. Evidence-Based Answer Individual dietary interventions alone fail to change body mass index or the standardized BMI z-score across all age groups. The impact of regular physical activity or combined dietary and physical activity interventions is modest at best.

1. In children five years and younger, combined dietary and physical activity interventions mildly decrease BMI and zBMI. 1 In children six to 12 years of age, physical activity interventions alone mildly decrease BMI without changing zBMI, whereas combined interventions mildly decrease zBMI without changing BMI.

Practice Pointers Obesity in children is defined as a BMI at the 95th percentile or greater on growth charts from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Childhood obesity rates are increasing, affecting 14% of children in 1999 and 19% in 2016. 3 Changes in zBMI approximate changes in BMI. In children five years and younger, neither dietary nor physical activity interventions alone improved obesity measures. Combined dietary and physical activity interventions led to an average decrease in BMI of 0. 11 kg per m. In children six to 12 years of age, physical activity interventions led to an average decrease in BMI of 0. 10 kg per m 2 without a change in zBMI. Dietary interventions alone were ineffective. Combined dietary and physical activity interventions led to an average decrease in zBMI of 0. 05 without a change in BMI. Interventions were effective if they were conducted in school or lasted up to 12 months.

No home interventions were conducted in this age group. Guidelines from the Department of Health and Human Services recommend at least an hour per day of moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity for all children. 4 Similarly, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommends 60 minutes of moderate to intense aerobic exercise each day and states that dietary modifications alone are insufficient to prevent obesity. 5 The limited evidence presented in this review supports combining dietary and physical activity interventions given the benefits for reducing childhood obesity. Interventions did not increase health inequalities and could temper existing inequalities.

### Interventions to prevent obesity in children aged 2 to 4 years old [^ccdff021]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Early childhood presents an important opportunity for obesity prevention, an international public health priority. Interventions aiming to prevent obesity typically promote healthy diets or activity levels (physical activity, sedentary behaviour), or both. There is uncertainty over which approaches are more effective. This is one of a suite of three reviews addressing interventions for preventing obesity in children, each focusing on different age groups up to 18 years. These reviews replace and update a 2019 Cochrane review on interventions for preventing obesity in children from birth to 18 years.

Objectives

To assess the effects of interventions that aimed to prevent obesity in children aged two to four years by changing dietary intake or activity levels, or both, on body mass index (BMI), BMI z-score (zBMI), BMI percentile, and serious adverse events.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, six other databases, and two trial registers, together with reference checking, citation searching, and contact with study authors to identify eligible studies. The latest search date was 7 February 2023.

Eligibility Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in children aged two to four years, comparing dietary or activity interventions (or both combined) to prevent overweight or obesity versus no intervention, usual care, or another eligible intervention, in any setting. Studies had to measure outcomes at a minimum of 12 weeks post-baseline. There were no language restrictions.

Outcomes

Our outcomes were BMI, zBMI, BMI percentile, and serious adverse events.

Risk Of Bias

We used version 2 of the Cochrane risk of bias tool (RoB 2) to assess included RCTs.

Synthesis Methods

Working independently, two authors screened studies, extracted data, and conducted risk of bias and GRADE assessments. We conducted random-effects meta-analyses stratified by type of intervention and follow-up duration.

Included Studies

We included 67 studies (36,601 participants), with 56 studies (21,404 participants) pooled in the meta-analyses. Sixty-three studies were conducted in high-income countries. Study settings were split between childcare (26 studies; 39%), home (23 studies; 34%), and home plus childcare settings (10 studies; 15%). Few studies were conducted in the community (three studies; 5%) or healthcare settings (five studies; 7%). Most studies compared a combined dietary/activity intervention with a control group.

Synthesis Of Results

Dietary interventions versus control Dietary interventions may have little to no effect on BMI at short-term follow-up (mean difference (MD) 0.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.28 to 0.28; 1 study, 94 participants; low-certainty evidence). At medium- and long-term follow-up, dietary interventions may result in little to no difference in BMI. One study (103 participants; low-certainty evidence) reported no difference in BMI at medium-term follow-up, and one study (2238 participants; low-certainty evidence) found lower rates of overweight and obesity in the intervention group at long-term follow-up. Dietary interventions likely result in little to no difference in zBMI at short-term (MD 0.03, 95% CI -0.13 to 0.19; 2 studies, 145 participants) and medium-term follow-up (MD -0.17, 95% CI -0.44 to 0.10; 1 study, 389 participants), both with moderate-certainty evidence. None of the included studies reported zBMI at long-term follow-up. None of the studies reported serious adverse events. Activity interventions versus control Activity interventions may have little to no effect on BMI at short-term follow-up, but the evidence is very uncertain (MD -0.10, 95% CI -0.28 to 0.08; 6 studies, 826 participants; very low-certainty evidence). They likely reduce BMI at medium-term follow-up (MD -0.70, 95% CI -1.09 to -0.31; 1 study, 567 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). None of the studies reported BMI at long-term follow-up. Activity interventions likely result in little to no difference in zBMI at short-term follow-up (MD -0.06, 95% CI -0.19 to 0.07; 3 studies, 635 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). They may result in little to no difference in zBMI at medium-term follow-up, but the evidence is very uncertain (MD -0.00, 95% CI -0.12 to 0.11; 4 studies, 1083 participants; very low-certainty evidence). None of the included studies reported zBMI at long-term follow-up. Activity interventions may have little to no effect on serious adverse events, but the evidence is very uncertain (2 studies, 773 participants; very low-certainty evidence). One study found no harms related to the intervention, and one study reported no difference in accident and infection rates between groups. Combined dietary/activity interventions versus control Combined dietary/activity interventions may have little to no effect on BMI at short-term follow-up, but the evidence is very uncertain (MD -0.08, 95% CI -0.20 to 0.04; 13 studies, 3867 participants; very low-certainty evidence). They may result in little to no difference in BMI at medium-term follow-up (MD -0.05, 95% CI -0.18 to 0.08; 9 studies, 7016 participants; low-certainty evidence), and may result in a slight reduction in BMI at long-term follow-up (MD -0.20, 95% CI -0.39 to -0.01; 5 studies, 2074 participants; low-certainty evidence). Combined interventions may have little to no effect on zBMI at short-term follow-up (MD -0.03, 95% CI -0.07 to 0.01; 14 studies, 5518 participants), and may result in a slight reduction in zBMI at medium-term follow-up, but the evidence for both time frames is very uncertain (MD -0.07, 95% CI -0.11 to -0.04; 15 studies; 11,043 participants). Combined interventions may result in a slight reduction in zBMI at long-term follow-up (MD -0.07, 95% CI -0.13 to -0.01; 10 studies, 4693 participants; low-certainty evidence). Combined interventions may result in little to no difference in serious adverse events, but the evidence is very uncertain (4 studies, 1689 participants; very low-certainty evidence). One study reported that a parent fractured an ankle while roller-skating at a community centre; the remaining studies reported no adverse events.

Authors' Conclusions

In early childhood, combined dietary/activity interventions may have very modest benefits on BMI and zBMI at long-term follow-up. When implemented alone, dietary or activity interventions may have little to no effect on BMI measures. Only six studies reported serious adverse events, with no serious harms resulting directly from the intervention, but the evidence is very uncertain.

### Diet, physical activity, and behavioural interventions for the treatment of overweight or obesity in preschool children up to the age of 6 years [^e8b0d66e]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Child overweight and obesity has increased globally, and can be associated with short- and long-term health consequences.

Objectives

To assess the effects of diet, physical activity, and behavioural interventions for the treatment of overweight or obesity in preschool children up to the age of 6 years.

Search Methods

We performed a systematic literature search in the databases Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and LILACS, as well as in the trial registers ClinicalTrials.gov and ICTRP Search Portal. We also checked references of identified trials and systematic reviews. We applied no language restrictions. The date of the last search was March 2015 for all databases.

Selection Criteria

We selected randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of diet, physical activity, and behavioural interventions for treating overweight or obesity in preschool children aged 0 to 6 years.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed risk of bias, evaluated the overall quality of the evidence using the GRADE instrument, and extracted data following the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. We contacted trial authors for additional information.

Main Results

We included 7 RCTs with a total of 923 participants: 529 randomised to an intervention and 394 to a comparator. The number of participants per trial ranged from 18 to 475. Six trials were parallel RCTs, and one was a cluster RCT. Two trials were three-arm trials, each comparing two interventions with a control group. The interventions and comparators in the trials varied. We categorised the comparisons into two groups: multicomponent interventions and dietary interventions. The overall quality of the evidence was low or very low, and six trials had a high risk of bias on individual 'Risk of bias' criteria. The children in the included trials were followed up for between six months and three years. In trials comparing a multicomponent intervention with usual care, enhanced usual care, or information control, we found a greater reduction in body mass index (BMI) z score in the intervention groups at the end of the intervention (6 to 12 months): mean difference (MD) -0.3 units (95% confidence interval (CI) -0.4 to -0.2); P < 0.00001; 210 participants; 4 trials; low-quality evidence, at 12 to 18 months' follow-up: MD -0.4 units (95% CI -0.6 to -0.2); P = 0.0001; 202 participants; 4 trials; low-quality evidence, and at 2 years' follow-up: MD -0.3 units (95% CI -0.4 to -0.1); 96 participants; 1 trial; low-quality evidence. One trial stated that no adverse events were reported; the other trials did not report on adverse events. Three trials reported health-related quality of life and found improvements in some, but not all, aspects. Other outcomes, such as behaviour change and parent-child relationship, were inconsistently measured. One three-arm trial of very low-quality evidence comparing two types of diet with control found that both the dairy-rich diet (BMI z score change MD -0.1 units (95% CI -0.11 to -0.09); P < 0.0001; 59 participants) and energy-restricted diet (BMI z score change MD -0.1 units (95% CI -0.11 to -0.09); P < 0.0001; 57 participants) resulted in greater reduction in BMI than the comparator at the end of the intervention period, but only the dairy-rich diet maintained this at 36 months' follow-up (BMI z score change in MD -0.7 units (95% CI -0.71 to -0.69); P < 0.0001; 52 participants). The energy-restricted diet had a worse BMI outcome than control at this follow-up (BMI z score change MD 0.1 units (95% CI 0.09 to 0.11); P < 0.0001; 47 participants). There was no substantial difference in mean daily energy expenditure between groups. Health-related quality of life, adverse effects, participant views, and parenting were not measured. No trial reported on all-cause mortality, morbidity, or socioeconomic effects. All results should be interpreted cautiously due to their low quality and heterogeneous interventions and comparators.

Authors' Conclusions

Muticomponent interventions appear to be an effective treatment option for overweight or obese preschool children up to the age of 6 years. However, the current evidence is limited, and most trials had a high risk of bias. Most trials did not measure adverse events. We have identified four ongoing trials that we will include in future updates of this review. The role of dietary interventions is more equivocal, with one trial suggesting that dairy interventions may be effective in the longer term, but not energy-restricted diets. This trial also had a high risk of bias.

### Interventions to prevent obesity in children aged 2 to 4 years old [^956e38e3]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Rationale

Early childhood presents an important opportunity for obesity prevention, an international public health priority. Interventions aiming to prevent obesity typically promote healthy diets or activity levels (physical activity, sedentary behaviour), or both. There is uncertainty over which approaches are more effective. This is one of a suite of three reviews addressing interventions for preventing obesity in children, each focusing on different age groups up to 18 years. These reviews replace and update a 2019 Cochrane review on interventions for preventing obesity in children from birth to 18 years.

Objectives

To assess the effects of interventions that aimed to prevent obesity in children aged two to four years by changing dietary intake or activity levels, or both, on body mass index (BMI), BMI z‐score (zBMI), BMI percentile, and serious adverse events.

Search methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, six other databases, and two trial registers, together with reference checking, citation searching, and contact with study authors to identify eligible studies. The latest search date was 7 February 2023.

Eligibility criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in children aged two to four years, comparing dietary or activity interventions (or both combined) to prevent overweight or obesity versus no intervention, usual care, or another eligible intervention, in any setting. Studies had to measure outcomes at a minimum of 12 weeks post‐baseline. There were no language restrictions.

Outcomes

Our outcomes were BMI, zBMI, BMI percentile, and serious adverse events.

Risk of bias

We used version 2 of the Cochrane risk of bias tool (RoB 2) to assess included RCTs.

Synthesis methods

Working independently, two authors screened studies, extracted data, and conducted risk of bias and GRADE assessments. We conducted random‐effects meta‐analyses stratified by type of intervention and follow‐up duration.

Included studies

We included 67 studies (36,601 participants), with 56 studies (21,404 participants) pooled in the meta‐analyses. Sixty‐three studies were conducted in high‐income countries. Study settings were split between childcare (26 studies; 39%), home (23 studies; 34%), and home plus childcare settings (10 studies; 15%). Few studies were conducted in the community (three studies; 5%) or healthcare settings (five studies; 7%). Most studies compared a combined dietary/activity intervention with a control group.

Synthesis of results

Dietary interventions versus control

Dietary interventions may have little to no effect on BMI at short‐term follow‐up (mean difference (MD) 0.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐0.28 to 0.28; 1 study, 94 participants; low‐certainty evidence). At medium‐ and long‐term follow‐up, dietary interventions may result in little to no difference in BMI. One study (103 participants; low‐certainty evidence) reported no difference in BMI at medium‐term follow‐up, and one study (2238 participants; low‐certainty evidence) found lower rates of overweight and obesity in the intervention group at long‐term follow‐up.

Dietary interventions likely result in little to no difference in zBMI at short‐term (MD 0.03, 95% CI ‐0.13 to 0.19; 2 studies, 145 participants) and medium‐term follow‐up (MD ‐0.17, 95% CI ‐0.44 to 0.10; 1 study, 389 participants), both with moderate‐certainty evidence. None of the included studies reported zBMI at long‐term follow‐up.

None of the studies reported serious adverse events.

Activity interventions versus control

Activity interventions may have little to no effect on BMI at short‐term follow‐up, but the evidence is very uncertain (MD ‐0.10, 95% CI ‐0.28 to 0.08; 6 studies, 826 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). They likely reduce BMI at medium‐term follow‐up (MD ‐0.70, 95% CI ‐1.09 to ‐0.31; 1 study, 567 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). None of the studies reported BMI at long‐term follow‐up.

Activity interventions likely result in little to no difference in zBMI at short‐term follow‐up (MD ‐0.06, 95% CI ‐0.19 to 0.07; 3 studies, 635 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). They may result in little to no difference in zBMI at medium‐term follow‐up, but the evidence is very uncertain (MD ‐0.00, 95% CI ‐0.12 to 0.11; 4 studies, 1083 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). None of the included studies reported zBMI at long‐term follow‐up.

Activity interventions may have little to no effect on serious adverse events, but the evidence is very uncertain (2 studies, 773 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). One study found no harms related to the intervention, and one study reported no difference in accident and infection rates between groups.

Combined dietary/activity interventions versus control

Combined dietary/activity interventions may have little to no effect on BMI at short‐term follow‐up, but the evidence is very uncertain (MD ‐0.08, 95% CI ‐0.20 to 0.04; 13 studies, 3867 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). They may result in little to no difference in BMI at medium‐term follow‐up (MD ‐0.05, 95% CI ‐0.18 to 0.08; 9 studies, 7016 participants; low‐certainty evidence), and may result in a slight reduction in BMI at long‐term follow‐up (MD ‐0.20, 95% CI ‐0.39 to ‐0.01; 5 studies, 2074 participants; low‐certainty evidence).

Combined interventions may have little to no effect on zBMI at short‐term follow‐up (MD ‐0.03, 95% CI ‐0.07 to 0.01; 14 studies, 5518 participants), and may result in a slight reduction in zBMI at medium‐term follow‐up, but the evidence for both time frames is very uncertain (MD ‐0.07, 95% CI ‐0.11 to ‐0.04; 15 studies; 11,043 participants). Combined interventions may result in a slight reduction in zBMI at long‐term follow‐up (MD ‐0.07, 95% CI ‐0.13 to ‐0.01; 10 studies, 4693 participants; low‐certainty evidence).

Combined interventions may result in little to no difference in serious adverse events, but the evidence is very uncertain (4 studies, 1689 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). One study reported that a parent fractured an ankle while roller‐skating at a community centre; the remaining studies reported no adverse events.

Authors' conclusions

In early childhood, combined dietary/activity interventions may have very modest benefits on BMI and zBMI at long‐term follow‐up. When implemented alone, dietary or activity interventions may have little to no effect on BMI measures. Only six studies reported serious adverse events, with no serious harms resulting directly from the intervention, but the evidence is very uncertain.

### Effectiveness of behavioural and psychological interventions for managing obesity in children and adolescents: a systematic review and meta-analysis framed using minimal important difference estimates based on GRADE guidance to inform a clinical practice guideline [^c005c560]. Pediatric Obesity (2025). Medium credibility.

2.3 Risk of bias

The risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 1 tool. For consistency with the previous risk of bias assessments for trials published in prior Canadian guidelines, we used the Cochrane risk of bias tool 1.0. For each study, we assessed (i) randomization, (ii) allocation concealment, (iii) blinding (participants, interventionists, outcome assessors), (iv) incomplete data reporting, (v) selective reporting and (vi) other biases such as industry involvement in the study or imbalance in participants' characteristics at baseline. We sought explicit statements reported within each publication to determine high or low risk of bias. We assigned unclear or some risk of bias for components that lacked overt statements and used the assessments to inform our GRADE CoE for each intervention on an outcome‐by‐outcome basis.

2.4 Data extraction

Data extraction was completed in duplicate (i.e. data verification) by one member of MERST team and verified by the team's statistician before data analysis. Data were extracted using standardized forms for study characteristics (setting, sample size, inclusion and exclusion criteria, characteristics of participants and type of intervention).

2.5 Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE)

For RCTs, GRADE rates the certainty of a body of evidence as high, moderate, low or very low. These ratings are based on an assessment of five domains that include (i) risk of bias, (ii) consistency across effect estimates/statistical heterogeneity, (iii) directness of the body of evidence to the population, intervention, comparator and/or outcomes of interest, (iv) precision of results and (v) indications of publication bias.

### Interventions to prevent obesity in children aged 5 to 11 years old [^a3fafc90]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Due to the fact that the majority of evidence (73%) identified was from school‐based interventions, the recommendations from this review are mostly applicable for policymakers, local education authorities and schools, and health professionals who work with schools. These stakeholders can be reasonably confident of the completeness of the evidence reviewed for school‐based interventions for children. Importantly, increasing activity levels and eating a healthier diet have health and well‐being benefits (outcomes) beyond the prevention of obesity and there is evidence that these behaviours track from childhood to adulthood. Indeed, major health conditions that make the greatest contribution to the burden of health care in adulthood in most high‐ and middle‐income countries are driven by unhealthy and risky behaviours, including low levels of physical activity and an unhealthy diet. Tackling these behaviours during adolescence should therefore be a priority. For children and their parents/carers, the evidence reviewed (albeit limited in some respects and of variable quality) provides some reassurance that interventions to prevent obesity do not appear to cause harm, including the promotion of eating disorders.

Quality of the evidence

We used the RoB 2 tool to assess the risk of bias of the 264 results from the 149 studies that were included in the meta‐analyses. Overall, we judged most of the results (147) as 'Some concerns', while we judged 13 results as 'Low risk of bias'. We judged 105 results as 'High risk of bias', mostly because of missing outcome data and time of participant recruitment in cluster‐RCTs. We tested the effect of removing studies rated at 'High risk of bias' (Appendix 6).

We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence of effects; we downgraded almost all results to 'moderate', 'low' or 'very low' certainty depending on the proportion of results at high risk of bias, the level of imprecision and heterogeneity, the generalisability of the results and the amount of missing evidence. Reasons for downgrading each of the GRADE criteria are reported below.

### Screening and interventions for overweight in children and adolescents: recommendation statement [^847b29b7]. Pediatrics (2005). Low credibility.

The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) is an independent panel of non-federal experts in prevention and primary care that systematically reviews the evidence of effectiveness and develops recommendations for clinical preventive services. This recommendation addresses the evidence for the accuracy of screening children and adolescents using BMI, the effectiveness of behavioral and pharmacologic interventions in improving health outcomes in these children, and the potential harms of routine screening and intervention. Using USPSTF methodology, an analytic framework with key questions was developed to guide the systematic review, which serves as the basis for this recommendation. The number of children and adolescents who are overweight has more than doubled in the last 25 years. Childhood and adolescent overweight is associated with increased health risks. The USPSTF found insufficient evidence for the effectiveness of behavioral counseling or other preventive interventions with overweight children and adolescents that can be conducted in primary care settings. Currently, available studies are limited by factors such as small sample sizes, poor generalizability, and variable follow-up. Based upon this critical gap in the evidence for effectiveness, the USPSTF concludes that the evidence is insufficient to recommend for or against routine screening for overweight in children and adolescents as a means to prevent adverse health outcomes ("I" recommendation). There are several gaps in the research evidence on screening and interventions for overweight children and adolescents in the primary care setting. Research is needed to provide well-defined and effective approaches to medical and psychological screening in children, as well as effective clinical approaches for the prevention and treatment of overweight in children that can be implemented by primary care clinicians.

US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation — high body mass index (BMI) in children and adolescents aged 6 years or older: The USPSTF recommends that clinicians provide or refer children and adolescents 6 years or older with a high BMI (≥ 95th percentile for age and sex) to comprehensive, intensive behavioral interventions. (B recommendation) Population is children and adolescents 6 years or older. The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that providing or referring children and adolescents 6 years or older with a high BMI to comprehensive, intensive behavioral interventions has a moderate net benefit.

### National Institutes of Health update: translating basic behavioral science into new pediatric obesity interventions [^dcf46275]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Pediatric obesity increases the risk of later-life obesity and chronic diseases. Basic research to better understand factors associated with excessive weight gain in early life and studies translating research findings into preventive and therapeutic strategies are essential to our ability to better prevent and treat childhood obesity. This overview describes several National Institutes of Health efforts designed to stimulate basic and translational research in childhood obesity prevention and treatment. These examples demonstrate the value of research in early phase translational pediatric obesity research and highlight some promising directions for this important area of research.

### A review of the prevention and medical management of childhood obesity [^567b7d33]. Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Prevention and management of childhood obesity remains a public health priority and necessitates an integrated chronic care approach. Obesity prevention efforts should focus on healthy family-based lifestyle modifications. The United States Prevention Services Task Force recommends children older than age 6 of years be screened for obesity and, if clinically indicated, be referred for moderate to high intensity comprehensive behavioral interventions. Childhood obesity and its comorbidities affect most medical specialties. A shared understanding of prevention strategies, lifestyle recommendations, screening guidelines for comorbidities, and stages of treatment will allow for more integrated and collaborative care.

Agreements and disagreements with other studies or reviews

Other comprehensive reviews on this topic have found similar results to those reported in this review, in that there is a modest effect or no effect of interventions that target individual change to prevent obesity in children (Liu 2019; Nally 2021; Peirson 2015). Of course, one can always find the rare study that shows that an intervention is effective, but the evidence base taken together suggests that the effect of these interventions is, at best, modest. Compared with previous reviews (Liu 2019; Nally 2021; Peirson 2015), including the previous version of the Cochrane review on preventing obesity in children (Brown 2019), this review includes the largest number of studies and children. The stark increase in the number of studies published over the past five to eight years reflects the focus and effort in tackling obesity in primary school‐aged children by research funding bodies and researchers. Although the confidence in the certainty of results remains moderate or low, due to methodological issues of the studies, the increased volume of evidence available for this review provides readers and stakeholders with reassurance that the results, at least for school‐based interventions, are unlikely to change with the addition of further studies that meet the same inclusion criteria.

Pediatric Obesity (2025). Medium credibility.

3.3.1 Body Mass Index Z ‐Score

Based on an estimated MID of 0.25 units, multicomponent interventions (versus usual care) showed a small reduction in BMIz for all ages combined (MD −0.18 95% CI −0.34 to −0.03, 16 RCTs, Table 6, Figure S2.49) based on moderate CoE (Table S6). In subgroup analyses, multicomponent interventions showed a very large reduction in 13 to 18 year‐olds (MD −1.55 95% CI −1.95 to −1.17, 1 RCT). Physical activity interventions (versus usual care) showed a small reduction in BMIz for all ages combined (MD −0.18 95% CI −0.39 to 0.03, 6 RCTs, Table 2, Figure S2.50) based on low CoE (Table S2) and a moderate reduction in BMIz among 13 to 18 year‐olds (MD −0.37 95% CI −0.51 to −0.22, 3 RCTs, Table 2). Technology interventions had a small reduction in BMIz when all age groups were combined (MD −0.16 95% CIs −0.34 to 0.02, 4 RCTs, Table 5, Figure S2.51) based on low CoE (Table S5), with a moderate reduction among 6 to 12 year‐olds (MD −0.34 95% CI −0.59 to −0.08, 4 RCTs, Table 5). Nutrition interventions had a small reduction in zBMI (MD −0.16 95% CIs −0.36 to 0.04, 4 RCTs, Table 3, Figure S2.52) based on low CoE (Table S3) and psychological interventions had little to no effect on BMIz (MD −0.07 95% CIs −0.15 to 0.02, 6 RCTs, Table 4, Figure S2.53) based on low CoE (Table S4).

Editorial Note

See https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD015328.pub2 and https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD015330.pub2 for more recent reviews that cover this topic.

Background

Prevention of childhood obesity is an international public health priority given the significant impact of obesity on acute and chronic diseases, general health, development and well-being. The international evidence base for strategies to prevent obesity is very large and is accumulating rapidly. This is an update of a previous review.

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness of a range of interventions that include diet or physical activity components, or both, designed to prevent obesity in children.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsychINFO and CINAHL in June 2015. We re-ran the search from June 2015 to January 2018 and included a search of trial registers.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of diet or physical activity interventions, or combined diet and physical activity interventions, for preventing overweight or obesity in children (0–17 years) that reported outcomes at a minimum of 12 weeks from baseline.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently extracted data, assessed risk-of-bias and evaluated overall certainty of the evidence using GRADE. We extracted data on adiposity outcomes, sociodemographic characteristics, adverse events, intervention process and costs. We meta-analysed data as guided by the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions and presented separate meta-analyses by age group for child 0 to 5 years, 6 to 12 years, and 13 to 18 years for zBMI and BMI.

Main Results

We included 153 RCTs, mostly from the USA or Europe. Thirteen studies were based in upper-middle-income countries (UMIC: Brazil, Ecuador, Lebanon, Mexico, Thailand, Turkey, US-Mexico border), and one was based in a lower middle-income country (LMIC: Egypt). The majority (85) targeted children aged 6 to 12 years. Children aged 0–5 years: There is moderate-certainty evidence from 16 RCTs (n = 6261) that diet combined with physical activity interventions, compared with control, reduced BMI (mean difference (MD) -0.07 kg/m 2, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.14 to -0.01), and had a similar effect (11 RCTs, n = 5536) on zBMI (MD -0.11, 95% CI -0.21 to 0.01). Neither diet (moderate-certainty evidence) nor physical activity interventions alone (high-certainty evidence) compared with control reduced BMI (physical activity alone: MD -0.22 kg/m 2, 95% CI -0.44 to 0.01) or zBMI (diet alone: MD -0.14, 95% CI -0.32 to 0.04; physical activity alone: MD 0.01, 95% CI -0.10 to 0.13) in children aged 0–5 years. Children aged 6 to 12 years: There is moderate-certainty evidence from 14 RCTs (n = 16,410) that physical activity interventions, compared with control, reduced BMI (MD -0.10 kg/m 2, 95% CI -0.14 to -0.05). However, there is moderate-certainty evidence that they had little or no effect on zBMI (MD -0.02, 95% CI -0.06 to 0.02). There is low-certainty evidence from 20 RCTs (n = 24,043) that diet combined with physical activity interventions, compared with control, reduced zBMI (MD -0.05 kg/m2, 95% CI -0.10 to -0.01). There is high-certainty evidence that diet interventions, compared with control, had little impact on zBMI (MD -0.03, 95% CI -0.06 to 0.01) or BMI (-0.02 kg/m2, 95% CI -0.11 to 0.06). Children aged 13 to 18 years: There is very low-certainty evidence that physical activity interventions, compared with control reduced BMI (MD -1.53 kg/m2, 95% CI -2.67 to -0.39; 4 RCTs; n = 720); and low-certainty evidence for a reduction in zBMI (MD -0.2, 95% CI -0.3 to -0.1; 1 RCT; n = 100). There is low-certainty evidence from eight RCTs (n = 16,583) that diet combined with physical activity interventions, compared with control, had no effect on BMI (MD -0.02 kg/m2, 95% CI -0.10 to 0.05); or zBMI (MD 0.01, 95% CI -0.05 to 0.07; 6 RCTs; n = 16,543). Evidence from two RCTs (low-certainty evidence; n = 294) found no effect of diet interventions on BMI. Direct comparisons of interventions: Two RCTs reported data directly comparing diet with either physical activity or diet combined with physical activity interventions for children aged 6 to 12 years and reported no differences. Heterogeneity was apparent in the results from all three age groups, which could not be entirely explained by setting or duration of the interventions. Where reported, interventions did not appear to result in adverse effects (16 RCTs) or increase health inequalities (gender: 30 RCTs; socioeconomic status: 18 RCTs), although relatively few studies examined these factors. Re-running the searches in January 2018 identified 315 records with potential relevance to this review, which will be synthesised in the next update.

Authors' Conclusions

Interventions that include diet combined with physical activity interventions can reduce the risk of obesity (zBMI and BMI) in young children aged 0 to 5 years. There is weaker evidence from a single study that dietary interventions may be beneficial. However, interventions that focus only on physical activity do not appear to be effective in children of this age. In contrast, interventions that only focus on physical activity can reduce the risk of obesity (BMI) in children aged 6 to 12 years, and adolescents aged 13 to 18 years. In these age groups, there is no evidence that interventions that only focus on diet are effective, and some evidence that diet combined with physical activity interventions may be effective. Importantly, this updated review also suggests that interventions to prevent childhood obesity do not appear to result in adverse effects or health inequalities. The review will not be updated in its current form. To manage the growth in RCTs of child obesity prevention interventions, in future, this review will be split into three separate reviews based on child age.

A systematic review of randomized controlled trials reported that 6 techniques held promise for preventing obesity during a period of at least 6 months: providing individualized information on the consequences of behaviors conducive to the development of obesity; restructuring the environment to make individualized behavior change more successful; guiding practices expected to decrease the development of obesity; guiding the identification of role models or advocates to change behavior; implementing stress management/emotional control training; and providing general communication skills training. The committee realized the difficulty in providing widespread exposure to behavior change programs but placed a high value on the pursuit of effective techniques of behavior change.

Obesity in the pediatric population is increasing in the United States and globally. Childhood obesity is associated with cardiometabolic and psychosocial comorbidities and decreased overall life span. The cause of pediatric obesity is multifactorial and includes genetic predisposition, lifestyle, behavioral patterns, and consequences of social determinants of health. Routine screening of BMI and comorbid conditions is essential to identifying patients who require treatment. The AAP recommends immediate Intensive Health Behavior and Lifestyle Treatment for children with obesity, encompassing lifestyle changes, behavioral changes, and mental health treatments. Pharmacologic interventions and metabolic and bariatric surgery are also available when indicated.

### Executive summary: clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and treatment of children and adolescents with obesity [^a8300dcf]. Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Pediatric obesity — intensive health behavior and lifestyle treatment (KAS 11): Intensive health behavior and lifestyle treatment (IHBLT), although challenging to deliver and not universally available, is the most effective known behavioral treatment of child obesity. Pediatricians and other PHCPs should provide or refer children aged 6 years and older — and may provide or refer children 2 through 5 years of age — with overweight and obesity to IHBLT (KAS 11). IHBLT is more effective with greater contact hours; the most effective treatments include 26 or more hours of face-to-face, family-based, multicomponent treatment over a 3- to 12-month period, and IHBLT should include nutrition, physical activity, and behavioral change support and be delivered by pediatricians or other PHCPs and their teams in collaboration with pediatric obesity specialists, allied health providers, and community partners.

### Ethics of implementing US preventive services task force recommendations for childhood obesity [^10ed478c]. Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Childhood obesity represents a serious and growing concern for the United States. Its negative consequences for health and well-being can be far-reaching, devastating, and intergenerational. In 2017, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) issued a grade B recommendation for screening children and adolescents for obesity and offering or referring to comprehensive, intensive behavioral interventions as indicated. However, many communities in the United States have limited access to such interventions. The USPSTF's mission is to review and grade research evidence for clinical preventive services and does not include cost or population-based operationalization and implementation logistics considerations for its recommendations. Yet implementing recommendations without considering cost and operationalization may lead to equity and access challenges. These are essential considerations, but oversight of the implementation of these recommendations is not standardized or assigned to any one agency or organization. As such, a central ethical feature inherent to the implementation of USPSTF recommendations calls for stakeholder collaborations to take on the next step beyond the establishment of evidence-based recommendations: to ensure the ethical application of such guidelines across diverse populations. Furthermore, the screening-intervention relationship inherent to this USPSTF recommendation raises ethical concerns regarding US societal norms surrounding obesity, particularly when contrasted against other screening-intervention modalities. More efforts, such as increased incentives or expansion of clinical services in low-resource areas, should be taken to facilitate this recommended intervention by expanding access to childhood obesity interventions to fulfill ethical responsibilities to equity and to ensure the right to open futures for children.

### Family-based behavioral treatment for childhood obesity implemented in pediatric primary care: a randomized clinical trial [^d7ab2935]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Intensive behavioral interventions for childhood overweight and obesity are recommended by national guidelines, but are currently offered primarily in specialty clinics. Evidence is lacking on their effectiveness in pediatric primary care settings.

Objective

To evaluate the effects of family-based treatment for overweight or obesity implemented in pediatric primary care on children and their parents and siblings.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This randomized clinical trial in 4 US settings enrolled 452 children aged 6 to 12 years with overweight or obesity, their parents, and 106 siblings. Participants were assigned to undergo family-based treatment or usual care and were followed up for 24 months. The trial was conducted from November 2017 through August 2021.

Interventions

Family-based treatment used a variety of behavioral techniques to develop healthy eating, physical activity, and parenting behaviors within families. The treatment goal was 26 sessions over a 24-month period with a coach trained in behavior change methods; the number of sessions was individualized based on family progress.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was the child's change from baseline to 24 months in the percentage above the median body mass index (BMI) in the general US population normalized for age and sex. Secondary outcomes were the changes in this measure for siblings and in BMI for parents.

Results

Among 452 enrolled child-parent dyads, 226 were randomized to undergo family-based treatment and 226 to undergo usual care (child mean [SD] age, 9.8 [1.9] years; 53% female; mean percentage above median BMI, 59.4% [n = 27.0]; 153 [27.2%] were Black and 258 [57.1%] were White); 106 siblings were included. At 24 months, children receiving family-based treatment had better weight outcomes than those receiving usual care based on the difference in change in percentage above median BMI (-6.21% [95% CI, -10.14% to -2.29%]). Longitudinal growth models found that children, parents, and siblings undergoing family-based treatment all had outcomes superior to usual care that were evident at 6 months and maintained through 24 months (0- to 24-month changes in percentage above median BMI for family-based treatment and usual care were 0.00% [95% CI, -2.20% to 2.20%] vs 6.48% [95% CI, 4.35%-8.61%] for children; -1.05% [95% CI, -3.79% to 1.69%] vs 2.92% [95% CI, 0.58%-5.26%] for parents; and 0.03% [95% CI, -3.03% to 3.10%] vs 5.35% [95% CI, 2.70%-8.00%] for siblings).

Conclusions and Relevance

Family-based treatment for childhood overweight and obesity was successfully implemented in pediatric primary care settings and led to improved weight outcomes over 24 months for children and parents. Siblings who were not directly treated also had improved weight outcomes, suggesting that this treatment may offer a novel approach for families with multiple children.

BMI percentile

Meta‐analyses results for BMI percentile are reported in Figure 5. We found that dietary and activity interventions, when compared with control, likely do not reduce BMI percentile at short‐term follow‐up (MD 0.73, 95% CI ‐0.50 to 1.97; I² = 0%; P = 0.58; 5 studies, 1036 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence; Analysis 3.7). Furthermore, we found that dietary and activity interventions, when compared with control, may have little to no effect on BMI percentile at medium‐term follow‐up (MD ‐0.64, 95% CI ‐1.85 to 0.56; I² = 64%; P = 0.008; 8 studies, 3823 participants; low‐certainty evidence; Analysis 3.8) and do not reduce BMI percentile at long‐term follow‐up (MD ‐0.67, 95% CI ‐3.05 to 1.72; I² = 82%; P = 0.0002; 5 studies, 1765 participants; very low‐certainty evidence; Analysis 3.9), but the evidence is very uncertain. Sensitivity analysis removing studies at high risk of did not change the overall results of the meta‐analysis (Appendix 6).

This article was designed to make a strong case for the importance of studying behavior and using behavioral therapy in the treatment of pediatric obesity. Behavioral treatments have been the most studied approaches to pediatric obesity, with great success. Six studies that provided long-term results are presented, and ideas for translating behavioral therapy into common pediatric practice are presented. Additional progress is needed to incorporate new findings in learning and behavioral neuroscience into clinical interventions and to integrate behavioral therapy with pharmacologic interventions and genetic predispositions and new advances in nutrition and exercise science.

### Effectiveness of a telephone-based randomised clinical trial targeting obesity risk of preschool-aged children: an extension study during the COVID-19 pandemic [^0842ca56]. International Journal of Obesity (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Preventing obesity in the first 2000 days of life is increasingly important given that there were 39 million children with overweight or obesity under the age of 5 years globally in 2020. Early prevention is critical because it not only helps prevent long-term health issues and improves the overall well-being of children but also shapes healthy lifestyle habits that will have a lifelong impact on the health of the whole population. Thus, the World Health Organization (WHO) Report of the Commission on Ending Childhood Obesity called for all stakeholders to take action to reduce obesity risk. Recommended actions include guidance and support for a healthy diet, sleep, and physical activity in early childhood.

Evidence has suggested that early interventions targeting mothers in pregnancy and postpartum can improve young children's healthy habits of feeding, eating, and actively playing, with mixed findings on body mass index (BMI). Hence, educating parents, creating supportive home and childcare environments, and developing healthy eating and physical activity policies are vital strategies for preventing early childhood obesity. Face-to-face education programs including home visiting, parenting classes or groups, and childcare settings with direct parental involvement, can be effective in reducing obesity risk in young children. Several studies have explored the effectiveness of telephone-based interventions for obesity prevention in early life, with some evidence suggesting positive outcomes in improved feeding and eating habits and reduced obesity risk.

### Interventions for high body mass index in children and adolescents: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^838364f0]. JAMA (2024). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF behavioral counseling interventions for high body mass index (BMI) in children and adolescents — trial scope and outcomes: Fifty randomized clinical trials (RCTs) (n = 8798) examined behavioral interventions, with 28 trials in the US and 22 in Europe, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Israel, and Turkey; 27 trials were in primary care settings and 23 in other health care settings. Most trials (41/50) enrolled participants with BMI at or above the 85th or 95th percentile, and the mean BMI percentile was 93 (range, 84.9–99.2); trials included children and adolescents aged 2 to 19 years with strata including 18 trials limited to elementary school–aged children (aged 6 to 8 years, up to age 12 years), 13 mixed preschool/elementary to adolescent trials, 12 adolescent-only trials, and 7 preschool- to kindergarten-aged trials. U.S. trials had a more diverse population — mostly White (52.4%), Black (20.5%), and Hispanic/Latino (25%) — and in reporting trials, 31% to 93% completed all sessions with average session attendance 60% (range, 24% to 80%). Trials rarely reported health outcomes, but among studies with more contact hours (≥ 26 contact hours) the mean difference in change in quality-of-life measures was 3.8 points (95% CI, 3.6 to 4.1), no studies reported longer-term benefits, and studies suggested that 4.4- to 5.4-point differences in the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) represent a minimal clinically important difference. Behavioral interventions were associated with reductions in BMI after 6 to 12 months (mean difference in change between groups, −0.7 [95% CI, −1.0 to −0.3]; 28 RCTs [n = 4494]; I2 = 86.8%), and cardiometabolic risk factor reporting from 16 trials (n = 1700) showed blood pressure improvements in pooled analyses of higher-contact trials (mean difference in systolic blood pressure, −3.6 mm Hg [95% CI, −5.7 to −1.5 mm Hg]; 8 RCTs [n = 773]).

Lifestyle treatment for pediatric obesity — Endocrine Society recommendation 4.1 states: We recommend clinicians prescribe and support intensive, age-appropriate, culturally sensitive, family-centered lifestyle modifications (dietary, physical activity, behavioral) to promote a decrease in BMI. (1|⊕⊕⊕⊖). Supporting evidence notes that change in body mass index (BMI) was associated with improvements in triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein, and systolic blood pressure, and other studies also showed associations between weight change and other metabolic outcomes. Additional data show that successful weight management through lifestyle interventions delays the onset of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in adults and improves cardiovascular fitness, and many pediatric programs have found improved body composition and metabolic parameters. For maintenance, the odds for weight regain are twofold greater in those who are sedentary, and in a 10-year study in the National Weight Control Registry, > 87% of participants maintained at least 10% weight loss for 5 to 10 years. There is sufficient evidence that intensive lifestyle modification programs can be effective tools for pediatric weight control in the short term.

### Expert panel on integrated guidelines for cardiovascular health and risk reduction in children and adolescents: summary report [^d2f0185b]. PES (2012). Medium credibility.

Pediatric overweight and obesity — evidence synthesis shows that the guideline review "identified 5 systematic reviews, 2 meta-analyses, and 69 RCTs" and a 2005 USPSTF review of trials since "1985". Among "23 identified studies", short-term behavioral counseling predominated and "mean BMI percentiles decreased from above the 95th percentile at baseline to between the 90th and 95th percentiles at 1-year follow-up; no long-term follow-up results were available". Adolescents were included in "Six studies" and a separate review of "17 studies", but "Only half of the interventions were associated with any mean change in BMI at short-term follow-up", and "dropout rates, as high as 45 percent, complicated results"; overall, "the evidence that behavioral counseling interventions are effective treatment for obese children and adolescents is fair to poor". A 2008 AHRQ review of RCTs from "between 2005 and 2007" found that medium- to high-intensity programs — "defined as meeting for at least 25 hours over 6 months" — were "effective in achieving small to moderate weight loss that was sustained for up to 12 months after the end of treatment", with "The majority of studies" in specialized research centers.

BMI

Meta‐analyses results for BMI are reported in Figure 3. The evidence suggests that activity interventions on average, compared with control, may have little to no effect on BMI at short‐term follow‐up (MD ‐0.02, 95% CI ‐0.17 to 0.13; I² = 86%; P < 0.00001; 14 studies, 4069 participants; low‐certainty evidence; Analysis 2.1) or at long‐term follow‐up (MD ‐0.07, 95% CI ‐0.24 to 0.10; I² = 64%; P = 0.007; 8 studies, 8302 participants; low‐certainty evidence; Analysis 2.3). In contrast, activity interventions likely result in a slight reduction of BMI at medium‐term follow‐up (MD ‐0.11, 95% CI ‐0.18 to ‐0.05; I² = 16%; P = 0.27; 16 studies, 21,286 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence; Analysis 2.2). Of the 16 studies included in the meta‐analysis, six were at high risk of bias. Sensitivity analysis removing studies at high risk of bias did not materially change the results of the meta‐analyses (Appendix 6), and funnel plots of BMI results at short‐ and medium‐term follow‐up did not show evidence of small‐study effects (Appendix 7).

### Expert committee recommendations regarding the prevention, assessment, and treatment of child and adolescent overweight and obesity: summary report [^274cc799]. Pediatrics (2007). Low credibility.

To revise 1998 recommendations on childhood obesity, an Expert Committee, comprised of representatives from 15 professional organizations, appointed experienced scientists and clinicians to 3 writing groups to review the literature and recommend approaches to prevention, assessment, and treatment. Because effective strategies remain poorly defined, the writing groups used both available evidence and expert opinion to develop the recommendations. Primary care providers should universally assess children for obesity risk to improve early identification of elevated BMI, medical risks, and unhealthy eating and physical activity habits. Providers can provide obesity prevention messages for most children and suggest weight control interventions for those with excess weight. The writing groups also recommend changing office systems so that they support efforts to address the problem. BMI should be calculated and plotted at least annually, and the classification should be integrated with other information such as growth pattern, familial obesity, and medical risks to assess the child's obesity risk. For prevention, the recommendations include both specific eating and physical activity behaviors, which are likely to promote maintenance of healthy weight, but also the use of patient-centered counseling techniques such as motivational interviewing, which helps families identify their own motivation for making change. For assessment, the recommendations include methods to screen for current medical conditions and for future risks, and methods to assess diet and physical activity behaviors. For treatment, the recommendations propose 4 stages of obesity care; the first is brief counseling that can be delivered in a health care office, and subsequent stages require more time and resources. The appropriateness of higher stages is influenced by a patient's age and degree of excess weight. These recommendations recognize the importance of social and environmental change to reduce the obesity epidemic but also identify ways healthcare providers and health care systems can be part of broader efforts.

### Prevention and treatment of pediatric obesity: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline based on expert opinion [^3727775d]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2008). Low credibility.

Although good-quality pediatric and adolescent data are scarce, there is sufficient evidence that intensive lifestyle modification programs, as in adults, can be an effective tool for pediatric weight control. Furthermore, implementation of a formal maintenance program after the treatment phase is completed can be of added importance in maintaining achieved weight loss. This fits into a concept of obesity as a chronic disease.

A meta-analysis of randomized pediatric trials, commissioned by this Task Force, of combined lifestyle interventions (diet and exercise) for treating obesity showed a modest but significant effect on obesity (equivalent to a decrease in BMI of 1.5 kg/m 2; P < 0.00001) when these interventions targeted family involvement. There was a decrease in BMI of 0.4 kg/m 2 when parents were not specifically included and the effect on weight loss was not significant (P = 0.13). Although the indirect comparison of effects across studies indicates that treatment is significantly more effective when it targets the family (P value for the interaction was 0.04), the direct comparisons (within the same trial) were inconsistent across trials and showed no significant difference. These results suggest involving the family when delivering combined lifestyle interventions. Another meta-analysis that looked specifically at the effects of family-behavioral therapy produced parallel results.

An additional meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials of lifestyle interventions, but without an analysis of family involvement, also found moderate positive effects from the interventions when compared with no treatment, wait-list, or information-only controls. These effects persisted for an average follow-up period of 15 months. Although there was overlap with the meta-analysis we commissioned, each study contained reports not covered by the other.

An evidence-based position statement of the American Dietetic Association (ADA) supports the utility of family-based lifestyle interventions in children and of similar multicomponent programs for adolescents. These recommendations are consistent with the conclusions of an evidence-based review of pharmacological interventions for childhood obesity that highlighted the importance of concomitant intensive lifestyle interventions — dietary, exercise, and family counseling — as well as by a combined CDC and American Medical Association expert committee.

### Interventions to prevent obesity in children aged 5 to 11 years old [^0e2da88a]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Potential biases in the review process

Our review updates part of a previous Cochrane review using the same eligibility criteria and largely the same methodology (Brown 2019). Following the original review, we included only studies that stated the (or one of a limited number of) main aim of changing diet, physical activity, sedentary behaviour, sleep, play or structured exercise to help prevent obesity in children. We therefore excluded studies of similar interventions that did not report such an aim. There is potential for this to bias our selection of studies if the reporting of primary studies' aims has been influenced by their findings. If in any doubt, we checked the aim with that provided in the published protocol or trial register where possible. We restricted eligibility to studies providing evidence of having measured BMI at baseline and follow‐up so that we could examine changes from baseline. Again, this restriction may have led to exclusion of studies of similar interventions to those we included.

Following the previous review, we also grouped studies into somewhat crude comparisons according to the broad target of behaviour change (diet or activity or both) of the intervention. This led to a diversity of specific intervention approaches within comparisons and probably accounts for some of the subsequent statistical heterogeneity. We were unable to determine the specific causes of this heterogeneity with our planned analyses. Further investigation of how the variation in intervention approaches and intervention fidelity impact on outcomes may be valuable, including how these relate to the wider determinants of health.

An important observation in most of our meta‐analyses was of high statistical heterogeneity, i.e. that effects varied substantially across studies within the comparisons. Prespecified subgroup analyses by main setting of the interventions (school, home, school and home, other), country income status (high income versus non‐high‐income) and participants' socioeconomic status (low versus mixed) did not provide an explanation for the heterogeneity observed among the studies. However, subgroup by duration of the intervention (short, medium, long) may explain some of the differential effects of activity and activity and dietary interventions on BMI and zBMI. This heterogeneity might be due to the interventions pooled within each category (diet, activity, diet combined with activity) being variable in nature, intensity and duration; their only common feature was the intended mechanism by which they worked. It is also possible that the heterogeneity is due, at least in part, to variability in the fidelity of the interventions, although we did not collect data on this.

### Economic evaluation of the communicating healthy beginnings advice by telephone trial for early childhood obesity prevention [^fcbe1dba]. Obesity (2022). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

The prevention of obesity has many individual and societal benefits, with early childhood recognized as a critical period for intervention. Globally, there has been a rapid increase in the number of children living with obesity over the past two decades, with an estimated 39 million children under age 5 years experiencing overweight or obesity in 2020. In Australia in 2017 and 2018, a quarter of children aged 2 to 17 years were affected by overweight or obesity, with one in twelve identified as having obesity.

Interventions to establish healthy lifestyle behaviors in the first 2000 days of a child's life are important in reducing risks for childhood obesity. Several randomized control trials (RCTs) have proven that such interventions can be effective in improving obesity‐related behaviors such as infant feeding practices and active play. However, their value for money is rarely evaluated even though this evidence is critical for decision‐making in settings where health budgets are restricted. To date, economic evaluations conducted alongside RCTs have been published for only three obesity‐prevention interventions in early childhood, to our knowledge. One of these studies examined the Healthy Beginnings program, in which staged home visits to deliver early childhood obesity‐prevention messages resulted in a lower mean body mass index (BMI) of participating children compared with those who did not participate in the program at the age of 2 years. The program had similar cost‐effectiveness to other interventions in this age group, but the home visits were relatively costly and had limited population reach.

### Interventions to prevent obesity in children aged 5 to 11 years old [^7f656c5d]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Overall completeness and applicability of evidence

Most studies were undertaken in general populations of high‐income countries. We identified 23 studies from upper‐middle‐income countries and three from a lower‐middle‐income country. The reasons why fewer trials of public health interventions that focus on non‐communicable diseases, such as those that aim to prevent obesity in children, are conducted in low‐ and middle‐income countries, include the cost of these trials and also the difference in research capacity, infrastructure, culture and priorities. In most of the studies, the participants were a mix of genders (150 studies); 13 studies were conducted only in girls and three only in boys. Fifty‐five studies specifically targeted disadvantaged children (or families) in a particular setting (e.g. school/community/area) or specifically targeted a school or community within a disadvantaged area. While the majority of studies were conducted among the general population, 13 studies targeted children considered 'at risk' of obesity based on their (or their parents) weight status, activity and dietary behaviours, or ethnic background. Given that public health policymakers require evidence of the impact of interventions to prevent obesity in children who are in the greatest need (disadvantaged, underserved), they can be reasonably confident of the completeness and applicability of the evidence reviewed here. Most interventions identified were school‐based.

### Clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and treatment of children and adolescents with obesity [^c5786b2d]. Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

AAP childhood obesity guideline — evidence gaps and scope — highlights that current research provides insufficient information on heterogeneity of treatment effects and that many studies use restrictive inclusion criteria excluding children with comorbidities, disabilities, physical activity limitations, or medication use. It notes limited reporting of intervention dose, duration, and specific components; that comorbidity studies are mostly cross-sectional, limiting guidance on the appropriate age to begin laboratory evaluation; that epidemiologic and longitudinal studies are needed to identify age and BMI ranges and to guide monitoring and reevaluation frequency; and that consistent laboratory thresholds are needed. Few primary care studies evaluate outcomes other than BMI, evidence is lacking on whether comorbidity assessment or diagnosis affects engagement, the role of SDoHs and culture is limited, and harms are seldom assessed despite behavioral interventions generally carrying low risk. The evidence review did not include primary prevention or assessment and treatment of children 0 to 2 years of age, and early prevention is emphasized because 1 in 7 preschool-aged children already have obesity.

### Obesity in preschoolers: behavioral correlates and directions for treatment [^a5ad89c5]. Obesity (2012). Low credibility.

Nearly 14% of American preschoolers (ages 2–5) are obese (BMI ≥ 95th percentile for age and gender), yet this group has received little attention in the obesity intervention literature. This review examines what is known about behavioral correlates of obesity in preschoolers and the developmental context for lifestyle modification in this age group. Information was used to critically evaluate existing weight management prevention and intervention programs for preschoolers and formulate suggestions for future intervention research development. A systematic search of the medical and psychological/behavioral literatures was conducted with no date restrictions, using PubMed, PsycInfo, and MEDLINE electronic databases and bibliographies of relevant manuscripts. Evidence suggests several modifiable behaviors, such as sugar sweetened beverage intake, television use, and inadequate sleep, may differentiate obese and healthy weight preschoolers. Developmental barriers, such as food neophobia, food preferences, and tantrums challenge caregiver efforts to modify preschoolers' diet and activity and parental feeding approaches, and family routines appear related to the negative eating and activity patterns observed in obese preschoolers. Prevention programs yield modest success in slowing weight gain, but their effect on already obese preschoolers is unclear. Multi-component, family-based, behavioral interventions show initial promise in positive weight management for already obese preschoolers. Given that obesity intervention research for preschoolers is in its infancy, and the multitude of modifiable behavioral correlates for obesity in this age group, we discuss the use of an innovative and efficient research paradigm (Multiphase Optimization Strategy; MOST) to develop an optimized intervention that includes only treatment components that are found to empirically reduce obesity in preschoolers.

### Medications for the treatment of obesity in adolescents [^b7091611]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Obesity affects a large percentage of the population. Globally, 39% of adults 18 years and older were overweight and 13% were obese in 2016. This disease is also prevalent in the pediatric population, as 18% of children and adolescents aged 5–19 years were overweight or obese in 2016. According to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), overall obesity rates have been rising, as evidenced by the fact that 30.5% of United States (US) adults in 1999–2000 were obese versus 39.6% in 2015–2016. Moreover, children and adolescents in the US also showed a significant increase in obesity prevalence from 13.9% in 1999–2000 to 18.5% in 2015–2016.

Obesity is associated with many health problems and has been linked to 4 out of the 10 leading causes of death in the US. Accordingly, the United States Preventive Services Task Force guidelines encourage clinicians to promote behavioral interventions as the primary focus of effective interventions for weight loss. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved anti-obesity agents for adults may be used as part of a comprehensive weight-loss program for patients with BMI ⩾30 kg/m 2 or BMI ⩾27 kg/m 2 and at least one weight-related comorbidity. Even so, current treatments for obesity are limited and under-utilized, as specifically, only about 1–2% of adults with obesity are prescribed anti-obesity agents. Multiple treatment considerations must be accounted for, that is, the cause of obesity, the side effects of the medication, and if the patient will benefit overall from pharmacotherapy. Special pediatric considerations must be taken into account when addressing obesity in children and adolescents. Childhood obesity can track into adulthood and obesity increases the risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Pharmacotherapy for weight loss in the pediatric population are much more limited than in adults. The 2017 Endocrine Society Guidelines suggest pharmacotherapy for adolescents if a formal lifestyle modification program fails to limit weight gain or to ameliorate comorbidities. Pharmacotherapy should only be used with FDA-approved medications prescribed by clinicians experienced in their use and should be discontinued if > 4% BMI/BMI z score reduction is not achieved after 12 weeks. Moreover, obesity medications are not recommended for use in children and adolescents < 16 years of age who are overweight but not obese, except in clinical trials. Currently orlistat and phentermine are the only FDA-approved medications for the treatment of obesity in adolescents < 18 years of age as an adjunct to lifestyle modifications.

Introduction

Globally, childhood overweight and obesity present a major public health challenge, with prevalence rates having increased substantially over the past four decades. According to World Health Organization estimates, 39 million children under the age of 5 were affected by overweight or obesity in 2020, and over 340 million children and adolescents aged 5–19 had overweight or obesity in 2016. In Australia, obesity is also a major health burden: one in four (24%) Australian children aged 5–14 years were affected by overweight (17%) or obesity (7.7%) in 2017–18. The prevalence of overweight and obesity remains higher in those of lower socioeconomic status (SES). There is evidence linking obesity in childhood to adolescence and adulthood obesity, and at least 18 co-morbidities. Thus, preventing obesity and related risk behaviors in early childhood is critical for long-term health outcomes.

To date, evidence for effective early obesity interventions is still developing. A 2019 systematic review showed weak to moderate evidence from 16 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on reducing the risk of obesity [i.e. body mass index (BMI)] in young children aged 0–5 years. The review also found all early interventions combining diet and physical activity components were delivered through a face-to-face approach in childcare center, community or home settings. However, over the past three years, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, governments globally implemented "social distancing" and "self-isolation" and have decreased or suspended many face-to-face health programs and services in an effort to contain the spread of the virus. Therefore, finding effective obesity prevention strategies that provide alternatives to face-to-face services has become pertinent during the pandemic and beyond.

BMI percentile

Meta‐analyses results for BMI percentile are reported in Figure 5. We found that dietary interventions compared with control may have little to no effect on BMI percentile at short‐term follow‐up, but the evidence is very uncertain (MD 1.90, 95% CI ‐3.44 to 7.24; I² = 49%; P = 0.14; 3 studies, 394 participants; very low‐certainty evidence; Analysis 1.7). Similarly, the evidence suggests that dietary interventions compared with control do not reduce BMI percentile at medium‐term follow‐up (MD ‐0.94, 95% CI ‐2.65 to 0.78; I² = 24%; P = 0.27; 3 studies, 4363 participants; low‐certainty evidence; Analysis 1.8) or long‐term follow‐up (MD ‐1.49, 95% CI ‐4.8 to 1.82; I² = 77%; P = 0.04; 2 studies, 776 participants; low‐certainty evidence; Analysis 1.9). Sensitivity analysis removing studies at high risk of bias did not change the overall results of the meta‐analyses (Appendix 6).

### Effectiveness of behavioural and psychological interventions for managing obesity in children and adolescents: a systematic review and meta-analysis framed using minimal important difference estimates based on GRADE guidance to inform a clinical practice guideline [^5107155b]. Pediatric Obesity (2025). Medium credibility.

3.2.4 High‐Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (‐C)

Using an estimated MID of 0.04 mmol/L, for physical activity interventions (versus usual care), there was moderate benefit on HDL‐C (MD 0.056 95% CI −0.039 to 0.152, 6 RCTs, Table 2, Figure S2.26) based on very low CoE (Table S2); among 13 to 18 year‐olds, our subgroup analyses revealed a very large benefit (MD 0.19 95% CI 0.10 to 0.27, 3 RCTs, Table 2). Multicomponent interventions (versus usual care) showed a very large benefit to HDL‐C (MD 0.13 95% CI 0.02 to 0.23, 6 RCTs, Table 6, Figure S2.27) based on moderate CoE (Table S6). Psychological interventions (Table 4, Figure S2.28) had little to no effect on HDL‐C based on low CoE (Table S4), whereas nutrition interventions (Table 3, Figure S2.29) and a single technology intervention (Table 5, Figure S2.30) favoured usual care based on very low and low CoE, respectively (Tables S3 and S5).

3.2.5 Low‐Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (‐C)

Based on an estimated MID of 0.1 mmol/L, physical activity interventions (versus usual care) showed a very large reduction in LDL‐C (MD −0.44 95% CI −0.68 to −0.19, 5 RCT, Table 2, Figure S2.31) based on moderate CoE (Table S2). Similarly, multicomponent interventions (versus usual care) showed a very large reduction in LDL‐C (MD −0.44 95% CI −0.86 to −0.01, 6 RCTs, Table 6, Figure S2.32) based on moderate CoE (Table S6). Nutrition (Table 3, Figure S2.33) interventions showed a small reduction in LDL based on low CoE (Table S3), whereas a single psychological intervention(Table 4, Figure S2.34) favoured usual care based on low CoE (Table S4). Technology interventions did not report LDL data.

### USPSTF recommends interventions for youth with high BMI… [^d0937cf8]. AAFP (2024). Medium credibility.

Overall, structured behavioral weight management interventions were associated with small reductions in BMI and modest reductions in weight after six to 12 months, with interventions that included ≥ 26 contact hours and offered physical activity sessions showing the greatest effects. Although few studies found significant improvements in quality of life, pooled analyses found small increases in total and physical quality of life after six to 12 months. "We know that there are proven strategies to help kids who have a high BMI achieve a healthy weight, " said USPSTF Chair Wanda Nicholson, M. D. M. P. H. M. B. A., in an ACIP news bulletin. "These interventions work best when both kids and parents are engaged, so it is important that health care professionals provide support in identifying which counseling interventions are available, accessible and a good fit for the family".

Varney largely agreed with the task force's recommended behavioral approach to caring for these patients, but she cautioned against dismissing pharmacotherapy out of hand. "Behavioral therapies, such as cognitive behavioral therapy and structured lifestyle interventions, have demonstrated substantial benefits in promoting sustained weight loss and improving overall health outcomes, " she said. "However, it is important to recognize that implementing behavioral therapy can be labor- and resource-intensive. These programs often require trained professionals, time-intensive sessions, and continuous follow-up, which can pose logistical and financial challenges". According to the USPSTF, no evidence demonstrated the relative benefits of specific intervention components.

Rather, the task force noted that "effective interventions commonly included supervised physical activity sessions; provided information about healthy eating, safe exercising, and reading food labels; and incorporated behavior change techniques such as problem solving, monitoring diet and physical activity behaviors, and goal setting". Interventions may include activities targeting both the parent and child and can be offered in group settings as well as in individual or single-family sessions. To be effective, they must involve at least 26 contact hours with a health care professional — or team of professionals — over the course of up to one year. In addition to physicians, disciplines involved may include exercise physiologists or physical therapists, dietitians or diet assistants, psychologists or social workers, or other behavioral specialists.

The Community Preventive Services Task Force has evaluated multiple evidence-based interventions aimed at curbing obesity in both youth and adults in community, school and other settings and recommends a range of options. Examples include behavioral interventions aimed at cutting recreational screen time, digital health interventions for teens and multicomponent interventions to increase availability of healthier foods and beverages in schools.

### Clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and treatment of children and adolescents with obesity [^94905a06]. Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Data extraction and quality assessment — randomized trials were given a quality assessment using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool, and the Subcommittee decided not to limit studies based on the study quality because many of them did not reach "high-quality" status; this occurred largely because studies consisted primarily of behavioral interventions without the possibility of blinding. All studies, regardless of group, were fully extracted by 2 reviewers, conflicts were discussed and resolved, and intervention studies were categorized into 5 groups for data extraction. For group 1 randomized trials of diet or "lifestyle" interventions, the Subcommittee categorized intensity into a dose (number of hours) of < 5 hours; 5 to 25 hours; 26 to 51 hours; and 52 or more hours; all interventions occurred over less than 1 year, and the Subcommittee conducted quality assessment for group 1 articles.
