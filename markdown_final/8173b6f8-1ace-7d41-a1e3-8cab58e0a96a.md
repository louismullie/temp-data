## Question

miralax to prevent bowel obstruction

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether MiraLAX (polyethylene glycol 3350) can be used to prevent bowel obstruction. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what MiraLAX is actually indicated for and whether any guideline or label supports prophylaxis against obstruction. Then, I should verify mechanistic plausibility and whether osmotic laxation could theoretically prevent obstruction. Next, I will check authoritative contraindications and safety warnings, especially in suspected or known obstruction. After that, I should review disease-specific contexts like malignant bowel obstruction and adhesive small-bowel obstruction to see if any expert groups allow cautious use. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified recommendation and confirm what, if anything, MiraLAX can reasonably do in patients at risk of obstruction.

> Let me first confirm the labeled indication and scope of use. MiraLAX is indicated for the symptomatic relief of occasional constipation; it is not indicated to prevent bowel obstruction, and I do not see any label or guideline endorsing prophylactic use for obstruction prevention, which already suggests the premise is off-label and unsupported by regulatory labeling or high-quality evidence [^7d5e2839] [^3b7d2098].

> Wait, let me verify the mechanistic angle before jumping to conclusions. MiraLAX works as an osmotic laxative that retains water in the stool, softens feces, and increases stool frequency; in theory, keeping stool soft and moving could reduce the risk of fecal impaction, which is one pathway to obstruction, but that is a theoretical benefit rather than proven prophylaxis against structural causes of obstruction like adhesions, hernias, tumors, or volvulus, so I should not over-interpret mechanism as clinical prevention [^c08b2a08] [^7d5e2839].

> Hold on, I should verify safety constraints because this is where harm can occur. Multiple FDA sources consistently contraindicate polyethylene glycol products in patients with known or suspected bowel obstruction, and they advise evaluating for obstruction before initiation if symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, or distension are present; this applies to prescription PEG-electrolyte solutions and is reflected in professional society guidance for colonoscopy prep regimens that include PEG, reinforcing that obstruction is a strict no-go zone for these agents [^6dbba693] [^5369c909] [^6d80fa8d] [^544f6bfc] [^196d27d1] [^0da223a9].

> I need to check disease-specific contexts where clinicians sometimes consider laxatives in partial obstruction. In malignant bowel obstruction, expert recommendations suggest oral osmotic laxatives like PEG may be considered only in partial obstruction with caution, while they should be avoided in complete obstruction; this is a nuanced, end-of-life care scenario and does not translate to routine prophylaxis in patients without obstruction, so I should not generalize this to primary prevention [^cb113ca9] [^1f280af8].

> Let me consider adhesive small-bowel obstruction, since that is a common context for recurrence. I should confirm whether any evidence supports PEG to prevent adhesive SBO. The literature on adhesion barriers reducing adhesive SBO does not show a role for oral PEG in prevention, and there are no trials or guidelines supporting PEG prophylaxis for adhesive SBO, so using MiraLAX for this purpose would be unsupported [^8bf011d1] [^9efaf262].

> But wait, what if the real-world question is about patients with chronic constipation who worry about obstruction risk. I should double-check whether maintaining soft stools with PEG reduces clinically meaningful obstruction events. While PEG is effective for chronic constipation and is recommended by guidelines for that indication, there is no evidence that it prevents future mechanical obstruction, and relying on it for obstruction prophylaxis could delay recognition of evolving obstruction or worsen outcomes if obstruction occurs, so counseling should emphasize indication-appropriate use and vigilance for red flags rather than prophylactic PEG [^8e690f7c] [^1200fc88] [^821b2352].

> I will now examine practical, risk-stratified guidance. For patients without obstruction who have constipation, MiraLAX can be used to treat constipation with attention to dose titration and tolerability, but it should be stopped and obstruction evaluated promptly if red flags develop. For patients with known or suspected obstruction, PEG is contraindicated and should not be used. For patients at high risk of obstruction due to adhesions, malignancy, or hernias, prevention strategies should focus on dietary modification, activity, and surgical consultation rather than prophylactic PEG, which lacks evidentiary support and could be dangerous if obstruction emerges [^7c42dd28] [^6dbba693] [^5369c909] [^cb113ca9].

> In summary, I should confirm the bottom line clearly. MiraLAX is not indicated and should not be used to prevent bowel obstruction; it is a treatment for constipation that may theoretically reduce fecal impaction risk but does not prevent mechanical obstruction from adhesions, hernias, tumors, or volvulus, and it is contraindicated in known or suspected obstruction, so using it for prophylaxis is inappropriate and potentially harmful [^7d5e2839] [^6dbba693] [^5369c909].

MiraLAX (polyethylene glycol 3350) is **not indicated to prevent bowel obstruction** and should not be used for this purpose. It is an osmotic laxative for occasional constipation relief [^7d5e2839] and is contraindicated in patients with known or suspected bowel obstruction [^5369c909] because it can worsen obstruction by increasing intraluminal pressure and causing perforation [^notfound]. There is **no evidence that MiraLAX prevents obstruction**, and using it in at-risk patients may delay appropriate care. Prevention of obstruction relies on dietary fiber, hydration, and management of underlying causes; MiraLAX should only be used for constipation under medical supervision.

---

## Pharmacological properties of MiraLAX

MiraLAX contains polyethylene glycol 3350 (PEG 3350), a non-absorbable polymer that **retains water in the colon**, softening stool and increasing frequency [^c08b2a08]. It is **not metabolized or absorbed**, making it generally well tolerated for constipation [^548259f0].

---

## Clinical indications and approved uses

MiraLAX is **approved for occasional constipation relief** in adults and children, typically for short-term use (≤ 2 weeks) unless directed by a physician [^eb8f2ad2] [^7d5e2839]. It is **not approved for prevention of bowel obstruction** or for use in patients with known or suspected obstruction [^5369c909].

---

## Risks and contraindications in bowel obstruction

MiraLAX is **contraindicated in patients with known or suspected bowel obstruction** [^5369c909] because it can increase intraluminal pressure, worsen obstruction, and lead to perforation [^notfound]. Symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, or distension warrant evaluation for obstruction before use [^6d80fa8d].

---

## Evidence regarding MiraLAX and bowel obstruction prevention

There is **no clinical evidence** that MiraLAX prevents bowel obstruction. No studies or guidelines support its use for this purpose, and using it in at-risk patients may delay definitive care.

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Guidelines and expert consensus **do not recommend MiraLAX for obstruction prevention**. It is indicated for constipation only, with caution in patients with GI symptoms that could signal obstruction [^7d5e2839] [^6d80fa8d].

---

## Alternative strategies for preventing bowel obstruction

Prevention focuses on:

- **Dietary fiber**: 25–35 g/day to maintain stool bulk and transit [^notfound].
- **Hydration**: adequate fluid intake to prevent hard stool.
- **Regular bowel habits**: avoid chronic constipation and straining.
- **Management of underlying conditions**: treat adhesions, hernias, tumors, or inflammatory bowel disease [^notfound].

---

## Clinical scenarios where MiraLAX may be considered

MiraLAX may be used for constipation in patients with **partial bowel obstruction** only under close medical supervision, with careful monitoring for worsening symptoms. It is **not appropriate for complete obstruction** or high-risk patients [^cb113ca9].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

MiraLAX is **not indicated to prevent bowel obstruction** and is contraindicated in obstruction. It should only be used for constipation under medical supervision, with attention to red flags. Prevention of obstruction relies on diet, hydration, and management of underlying causes — not on MiraLAX.

CLINICAL TRIALS

In one study, patients with less than 3 bowel movements per week were randomized to Polyethylene Glycol 3350 NF, 17 grams or placebo for 14 days. An increase in bowel movement frequency was observed for both treatment groups during the first week of treatment. Polyethylene Glycol 3350 NF was statistically superior to placebo during the second week of treatment. In another study, patients with 3 bowel movements or less per week and/or less than 300 grams of stool per week were randomized to 2 dose levels of Polyethylene Glycol 3350 NF or placebo for 10 days each. Success was defined by an increase in both bowel movement frequency and daily stool weight. For both parameters, superiority of the 17 gram dose of Polyethylene Glycol 3350 NF over the placebo was demonstrated.

### Pediatric constipation therapy using guidelines and polyethylene glycol 3350 [^d38218fd]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To review current guidelines on the treatment of functional constipation in pediatric patients, with an emphasis on the role of polyethylene glycol 3350 (PEG 3350).

Data Sources

Primary medical literature published in English was identified by MEDLINE search (1980-May 2003).

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Recently published treatment guidelines relating to pediatric functional constipation and its pharmacotherapy are assessed and compared. Published trials evaluating PEG 3350 in pediatric subjects are discussed and their results applied to the clinical role and use of this new agent.

Data Synthesis

Constipation is a common disorder among children. A number of factors may play a role. A variety of medications are commonly used for this disorder, although few treatments have undergone evaluation by controlled clinical trials. Consensus guidelines recommend either osmotic laxatives, mineral oil, or their combination for maintenance treatment in concert with patient and parental education and behavioral training. PEG 3350 solution (MiraLax) has been shown in recent clinical studies to be an effective maintenance treatment for pediatric constipation.

Conclusions

PEG 3350 is an effective and well-tolerated treatment choice for pediatric constipation, especially as an adjunct to education and behavioral training. PEG 3350 is an option for children with constipation who have failed or are intolerant of other pharmacotherapies.

### Overnight efficacy of polyethylene glycol laxative [^5f495e9a]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2002). Low credibility.

Objectives

Clinical studies in constipated adult patients have shown that a 17- or 34-g daily dose of polyethylene glycol (PEG) 3350 (MiraLax) is safe and effective for the treatment of constipation, with the best efficacy seen in wk 2 of treatment. The purpose of this study was to determine an optimal dose of PEG to provide satisfactory relief of constipation within 24 h.

Methods

A total of 24 adult study subjects who met Rome II criteria for constipation were randomized in a double-blind, parallel pilot study to receive a single dose of placebo or PEG laxative at doses of 51, 68, or 85 g in 500 ml of flavored water. Over a 72-h period, subjects rated bowel movements (BM), completeness of evacuation, and satisfaction.

Results

The 68-g dose seemed to be most satisfactory. Five of six subjects had a BM within 24 h. The time to first BM was 14.8 h for 68 g versus 27.3 h for placebo (p = NS). The time to second BM was 19.2 h versus 47.2 h for 68 g and placebo, respectively (p = 0.003). Of the subjects receiving 68 g of PEG, 50% and 100% reported complete evacuation for the first and second BM, respectively. The average number of BMs in 24 h for placebo, 51 g, 68 g, and 84 g were 0.5, 2.2, 2.2, and 4.2, respectively (p = 0.004). There were no adverse reactions, and no patient reported incontinence or complained of cramps or diarrhea at any dose. There were no changes in measured electrolytes, calcium, glucose, BUN, creatinine, or serum osmolality.

Conclusions

A 68-g dose of PEG laxative seems to provide safe and effective relief in constipated adults within a 24-h period.

### A randomized, multicenter, placebo-controlled trial of polyethylene glycol laxative for chronic treatment of chronic constipation [^3cf867c2]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2007). Low credibility.

Objectives

Polyethylene glycol (PEG) 3350 (MiraLAX) is currently approved for the short-term treatment of occasional constipation. This study was designed to compare the safety and efficacy of PEG laxative versus placebo over a 6-month treatment period in patients with chronic constipation.

Methods

Study subjects who met defined criteria for chronic constipation were randomized in this double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel, multicenter study to receive PEG laxative as a single daily dose of 17 g or placebo for 6 months. Baseline constipation status was confirmed during a 14-day observation period. As a primary efficacy variable, treatment success was defined as relief of modified ROME criteria for constipation for 50% or more of their treatment weeks. Various secondary measures were assessed. An Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS) recorded daily bowel movement experience and study efficacy and safety information. Laboratory testing at baseline and monthly for the study duration was analyzed for hematology, blood chemistry including amylase, GGT, uric acid, lipids, and urinalysis.

Results

A total of 304 patients were enrolled and received treatment at one of 50 centers. Successful treatment according to the primary efficacy variable was seen in 52.0% of PEG and 11% of placebo subjects (P < 0.001). Similar efficacy was seen in a subgroup of 75 elderly subjects. According to the primary efficacy definition (based on individual treatment weeks), 61% of PEG treatment weeks versus 22% of the placebo weeks were successful (P < 0.001). There were no significant differences in laboratory findings or adverse events except for the gastrointestinal category where diarrhea, flatulence, and nausea were the most frequent with PEG although they were not individually statistically significant compared with placebo. Similar results were observed when analyzed for differences due to gender, race, or age.

Conclusions

PEG laxative is safe and effective for use in patients with chronic constipation for 6 months.

### Lack of lasting effectiveness of PEG 3350 laxative treatment of constipation [^7d19f1ec]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose

PEG 3350 (MiraLax, Braintree Laboratories Inc., Braintree, MA) 17 g daily has been shown to be safe and effective in a 14-day trial for constipation. This present investigation was designed to extend the treatment and safety experience with PEG 3350 and to evaluate any lasting effectiveness during a 30-day post-treatment observation period.

Methods

Study subjects met Rome II criteria for constipation and reported <3 bowel movements a week. They were treated with PEG 3350 17 g daily for 14 days. Treatment efficacy was defined by resolution of constipation symptoms as determined by the Rome II and stool frequency definitions during the treatment period.

Results

Fifty healthy constipated subjects formed the study group. There were 42 females and 8 males. Mean age was 52 +/- 15.5 years (+/-SD). Symptom duration was 22.6 +/- 16.7 months (+/-SD). At baseline, all had <3 bowel movements a week and met Rome II criteria. Two were lost to follow-up. Two took enemas or laxatives and 2 discontinued active treatment because of "gas" and were considered treatment failures. At the end of 14 days, 40 of 48 (83.3%) had >3 stools in the last week and no longer met Rome criteria. Thirty-two of 45 (71.1%) reported satisfaction with the first bowel movement after initiating treatment. Thirty days after active treatment, 29 of 47 (61.7%) responded that they needed laxative treatment.

Conclusion

PEG 3350 relieved constipation in most treated study subjects. During a 30-day post-treatment observation period, 29 of 47 (61.7%) had additional constipation treatment interventions.

### American Gastroenterological Association-American College of Gastroenterology clinical practice guideline: pharmacological management of chronic idiopathic constipation [^8e690f7c]. Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Polyethylene glycol (PEG)—randomized trial regimens and key efficacy findings include the following: Three randomized, placebo-controlled trials studied the effect of PEG on constipation. In two trials, the treatment consisted of 15 g of PEG with electrolytes dissolved in 250 mL of water twice daily; one had a 28-week treatment period and another used an initial 4-week PEG phase with responders randomized to PEG or placebo for 20 weeks. In a United States trial, participants were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to PEG 3350 or placebo at a dose of 17 g mixed in 8 ounces of liquid once daily for 6 months. PEG likely results in an increase in complete spontaneous bowel movements (CSBMs) per week compared with placebo (MD 2.90, CI 2.12–3.68).

Laxatives

Suggestion: Oral osmotic laxatives should be considered in the management of impaired bowel movements in partial bowel obstruction but should be avoided in complete MBO (level of evidence: V; grade: D).

Patients with MBO present with reduced or no bowel movements. The review did not identify any studies that specifically examined the use of laxatives in this context. If patients have complete MBO, the use of laxatives is not recommended. Whereas, if patients have partial BO, the cautious use of oral osmotic laxatives (e.g. polyethylene glycol 3350, also known as macrogol) can be used. Osmotic laxatives draw water into the lumen of the bowel to soften stool and stimulate peristalsis. The use of bulk-forming laxatives (e.g. psyllium) is not advised as they will increase stool consistency and potentially worsen BO. If a digital rectal examination identifies a full rectum or fecal impaction, suppositories and fecal disimpaction can be considered in partial MBO. However, enemas should be used with caution and are generally not recommended in MBO due to the risk of bowel perforation. Stool softeners (e.g. docusate) may be used, but their effect on bowel movement frequency is not well established.

Analgesics

Pain is experienced by 70 to 90% of patients with MBO. Causes include abdominal distention, bowel spasms, and, in some cases, perforation. Pain can be intermittent, cramping, or continuous in nature. The WHO Guidelines for the Pharmacologic and Radiotherapeutic Management of Cancer Pain in Adults and Adolescents recommend that analgesics should be given by mouth whenever possible. However, patients with MBO often have significant nausea and vomiting and malfunctioning gastrointestinal tracts that prevent ingestion and absorption of oral analgesics. Consequently, the parenteral (subcutaneous or intravenous) and/or transdermal routes of administration should be considered for this population to deliver effective analgesia. A comparison of subcutaneous and intravenous routes found no differences, confirming both routes as feasible, effective, and safe.

Methods

Literature review

Text word searches were carried out using MEDLINE, MEDLINE in Progress, EMBASE, and the Cochrane databases covering inception to April 2015. Search terms were (constipation) AND (PEG OR polyethylene OR macrogol OR movicol OR idrolax OR miralax OR transipeg OR forlax OR colyte OR golytely OR isocolan OR nulytely) NOT colonoscopy. Studies were included in the final analysis if they met the following criteria: published randomised controlled trials comparing oral polyethylene glycol with placebo or a comparator laxative in patients with constipation. A diagnosis of constipation could be based on clinical symptoms, a physician’s opinion, or the Rome I, II or III diagnostic criteria. Bibliographies of all identified relevant studies and reviews were used to perform a recursive search. Only studies conducted in adults and published in English, excluding conference proceedings, were included in the analysis. Attempts were made to contact the authors of several studies for additional information about their data, with one successful response received.

### MASCC multidisciplinary evidence-based recommendations for the management of malignant bowel obstruction in advanced cancer [^1f280af8]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2022). High credibility.

Laxatives in malignant bowel obstruction—Suggestion: Oral osmotic laxatives should be considered in the management of impaired bowel movements in partial bowel obstruction but should be avoided in complete MBO (level of evidence: V; grade: D). If patients have complete MBO, the use of laxatives is not recommended. Whereas, if patients have partial BO, the cautious use of oral osmotic laxatives (e.g., polyethylene glycol 3350, also known as macrogol) can be used. The use of bulk-forming laxatives (e.g., psyllium) is not advised as they will increase stool consistency and potentially worsen BO. If a digital rectal examination identifies a full rectum or fecal impaction, suppositories and fecal disimpaction can be considered in partial MBO. However, enemas should be used with caution and are generally not recommended in MBO due to the risk of bowel perforation. Stool softeners (e.g., docusate) may be used, but their effect on bowel movement frequency is not well established.

### Polyethylene glycol 3350 for constipation in children with dysfunctional elimination [^df3d5b62]. The Journal of Urology (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose

Children with daytime wetting often have constipation, and treatment of constipation helps children become dry. Polyethylene glycol 3350 (Miralax, Braintree Laboratories, Braintree, Massachusetts) is a nonaddictive, tasteless powder that can be mixed with any liquid for treatment of constipation.

Materials and Methods

We review our use of polyethylene glycol 3350 in 35 girls and 11 boys with dysfunctional elimination. Noninvasive urodynamic studies and post-void residual measurement were performed before and during treatment.

Results

A significant increase in frequency of bowel movements occurred while taking polyethylene glycol 3350 (p = 0.0001). Average final dose was 0.63 gm/kg. The only reported adverse effect was diarrhea (9 patients). Of the children 18 became dry, 26 had decreased wetting and 2 had no improvement. Voided volume increased (146 vs 210 ml, p <0.0001) and post-void residual decreased significantly (92 vs 48 ml, p <0.0001) while on polyethylene glycol 3350. Ten children were still considered constipated including both patients who experienced no change in wetting. Average final dose in this group (0.69 gm/kg) did not differ significantly from those in whom constipation resolved (0.61 gm/kg). Patients in whom constipation resolved had a significantly lower post-void residual than those who remained constipated (11.8% vs 30.6%, p <0.01) and were significantly more likely to become dry or improved (p = 0.045).

Conclusions

The efficacy, compliance and lack of significant side effects make polyethylene glycol 3350 an ideal substance for treatment of constipation in children with dysfunctional elimination. Persistent constipation was associated with decreased resolution of voiding symptoms and significantly increased post-void residuals.

### Polyethylene glycol-3350, sodium chloride, potassium chloride and sodium bicarbonate (Gavilyte-N) [^8e662228]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

GaviLyte™- N (GAV-ee-LITE-N)

(polyethylene glycol 3350 (420 g), sodium chloride, sodium bicarbonate and potassium chloride oral solution)

Read this Medication Guide before you start taking GaviLyte-N. This information does not take the place of talking with your healthcare provider about your medical condition or your treatment.

What is the most important information I should know about GaviLyte-N?

GaviLyte-N and other osmotic bowel preparations can cause serious side effects, including:

Serious loss of body fluid (dehydration) and changes in blood salts (electrolytes) in your blood.

These changes can cause:

abnormal heartbeats that can cause death
seizures . This can happen even if you have never had a seizure.
kidney problems

Your chance of having fluid loss and changes in body salts with GaviLyte-N is higher if you:

have heart problems
have kidney problems
take water pills or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS)

Tell your healthcare provider right away if you have any of these symptoms of a loss of too much body fluid (dehydration) while taking GaviLyte-N:

vomiting that prevents you from keeping down the solution
dizziness
urinating less often than normal
headache

See Section "What are the possible side effects of GaviLyte-N" for more information about side effects.

What is GaviLyte-N?

GaviLyte-N is a prescription medicine used by adults to clean the colon before a colonoscopy. GaviLyte-N cleans your colon by causing you to have diarrhea. Cleaning your colon helps your healthcare provider see the inside of your colon more clearly during your colonoscopy.

GaviLyte-N is safe and effective for use in pediatric patients aged 6 months and older.

Who should not take GaviLyte-N?

Do not take GaviLyte-N if your healthcare provider has told you that you have:

a blockage in your bowel (obstruction)
an opening in the wall of your stomach or intestine (bowel perforation)
problems with food and fluid emptying from your stomach (gastric retention)
a very dilated intestine (bowel)
an allergy to any of the ingredients in GaviLyte-N. See the end of this leaflet for a complete list of ingredients in GaviLyte-N.

### Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of polyethylene glycol (miraLAX ®) for urinary urge symptoms [^aa21ac30]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

Polyethylene glycol (PEG) is common first-line therapy for urinary symptoms despite minimal evidence-based support. We performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of PEG for initial treatment of overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms in children.

Patients and Methods

Patients aged >3 years underwent baseline urinary symptom questionnaire (USQ, scored 0-16), bowel symptom questionnaire (scored 0-20) and abdominal X-ray (KUB). Patients were randomized to placebo/PEG regardless of parent's perception of constipation. After 1 month, patients completed follow-up questionnaires and KUB. Improvement was defined as decrease in USQ (ΔUSQ) ≥ 3 points. Secondary analyses compared urinary and bowel symptoms to KUB.

Results

Of 138 enrolled patients, 71 (51.4%) completed 1 month of therapy. Analyses of those randomized to placebo vs. PEG and non-completers demonstrated similar demographics, baseline symptoms, and KUB. Patients treated with placebo and PEG both had significant improvement in USQ scores (p < 0.0001). Patients treated with placebo and PEG responded similarly to placebo (ΔUSQ 3.7 vs. 3.4, p = 0.773), with improvement in nearly half (48.5% PEG vs. 44.7% placebo). There was no correlation between KUB and urinary or bowel symptoms.

Conclusions

Nearly 50% of patients with urinary urge symptoms treated with either placebo or PEG for 1 month had improvement in urinary symptoms. KUB did not correlate with baseline or follow-up urinary or bowel symptoms.

Dosing and Duration of Treatment

No difference was found in mean daily number of sachets used during the whole study period (PEG3350 + E: 1.74 [SD 0.78]; PEG4000: 1.80 [SD 0.60]; P = 0.67). Mean daily dose of PEG relative to body weight was 0.29 g/kg (SD: 0.17) and 0.43 g/kg (SD: 0.17), for PEG3350 + E and PEG4000, respectively (P < 0.001). In both treatment groups, older subjects used lower doses of PEG relative to body weight (0 to 2 years: 0.45 and 0.65 g/kg; 2 to 4 years: 0.32 and 0.48 g/kg; 4 to 8 years: 0.25 and 0.35 g/kg; 8 to 16 years: 0.15 and 0.26 g/kg; P < 0.001 and P < 0.0001; linear trend: P < 0.0001 and P < 0.0001; in PEG3350 + E and PEG4000, respectively). Mean duration of treatment was 261 days (SD 147) in the PEG3350 + E group and 327 days (SD 88) in the PEG4000 group (P = 0.009).

Treatment Success and Use of Rescue Medication

The rate of treatment success ranged from 33% and 25% at week 1 to 50% and 45% at week 52, for subjects treated with PEG3350 + E and PEG4000, respectively (Fig. 3). At all visits, no significant differences were found in rates of treatment success between treatment groups. Rescue medication was used at least once in 35% (17/48) of the subjects in the PEG3350 + E group and 18% (9/49) in the PEG4000 group (P = 0.07).

### A randomised, double-blind study of polyethylene glycol 4000 and lactulose in the treatment of constipation in children [^548259f0]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Constipation is an extremely common problem in children accounting for 3% of all visits to paediatric outpatient clinics and up to as many as 25% of all visits to paediatric gastroenterologists in the United States. Nonetheless, the prevalence of functional constipation in the community is not known with any precision, and prevalence rates ranging from 0.7% to 29.6% have been reported in the literature, with a median of 8.9%. In Asian populations, reported prevalence rates are at the higher end of the range, for example 29.6% in Hong Kong and 24.9% in Shanghai.

The occurrence of chronic constipation in children can lead to significant abdominal pain, appetite suppression, lowered self-esteem due to faecal incontinence, social isolation, feelings of depression, school absenteeism and family disruption. Moreover, if constipation in children is not adequately managed, it may persist into adulthood. On the other hand, effective early treatment in children may provide a definitive cure.

Treatment goals are to produce soft, painless stools and to prevent the reaccumulation of faeces, which can be achieved through dietary modification, behavioural interventions, and the use of laxatives, or a combination thereof. With respect to medication, choices include lubricants, such as paraffin oil, osmotic laxatives, including lactulose, sorbitol, magnesium hydroxide and polyethylene glycol (PEG), and stimulant laxatives such as senna or bisacodyl.

Polyethylene glycol (PEG, macrogol) is a polymer of ethylene oxide units of variable molecular weight. Polymers with a molecular weight of over 3000 are essentially unabsorbed or metabolised in the intestine and are used as osmotic laxatives, due to their high water binding capacity. Two PEG preparations, PEG 3350 (Glycolax ®, Miralax ®, Braintree Laboratories Inc, Braintree, Mass, USA, Transipeg ® Bayer) and PEG 4000 (Forlax ®, Ipsen, France) have been developed for this purpose.

### MiraLAX is not as effective as goLytely in bowel cleansing before screening colonoscopies [^1088e7dc]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2011). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Successful colonoscopies require good bowel preparations-poor bowel preparations can increase medical costs, rates of missed lesions, and procedure duration. The combination of polyethylene glycol (PEG) 3350 without electrolytes (MiraLAX; Schering-Plough Healthcare Products, Inc, Kenilworth, NJ) and 64 oz of Gatorade (PepsiCo, Inc, Purchase, NY) has gained popularity as a bowel preparation regimen. However, the efficacy and tolerability of this approach has not been compared with standard bowel preparations in clinical trials. We compared split-dose (PEG) 3350 with electrolytes (GoLytely; Braintree Laboratories, Inc, Braintree, MA) with split-dose MiraLAX alone and in combination with pretreatment medications (bisacodyl or lubiprostone) to determine the efficacy and patient tolerability of MiraLAX as an agent for bowel preparation.

Methods

We performed a prospective, randomized, blinded, controlled trial at a tertiary care center. Patients (n=403) were randomly assigned to groups given GoLytely, MiraLAX, MiraLAX with bisacodyl (10 mg), or MiraLAX with lubiprostone (24 μg). MiraLAX was combined with 64 oz of Gatorade. All patients were surveyed regarding preparation satisfaction and tolerability. The Ottawa bowel preparation scale was used to grade colon cleanliness.

Results

GoLytely was more effective at bowel cleansing (average Ottawa score, 5.1) than MiraLAX alone (average Ottawa score, 6.9) or in combination with lubiprostone (average Ottawa score, 6.8), or bisacodyl (average Ottawa score, 6.3) (P<.001). MiraLAX was associated with a trend toward longer procedure duration (P=.096). Groups given MiraLAX rated the overall experience as more satisfactory than those given GoLytely (P<.001). There were no differences between polyp detection rates (P=.346) or adverse events (P=.823).

Conclusions

Split-dose MiraLAX in 64 oz of Gatorade is not as effective as 4 L split-dose GoLytely in bowel cleansing for screening colonoscopies.

### A randomized, multicenter comparison of polyethylene glycol laxative and tegaserod in treatment of patients with chronic constipation [^b8fae680]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

Polyethylene glycol (PEG) 3350 (MiraLax) and tegaserod (Zelnorm), a serotonin subtype 4 receptor partial agonist, are currently approved for treatment of constipation. This study was designed to compare the efficacy of each product over a 4-wk treatment period.

Methods

Study patients who met defined criteria for chronic constipation were randomized in this open-labeled, parallel, multicenter study to receive the PEG laxative as a single daily dose of 17 g or tegaserod tablets 6 mg b.i.d., for 28 days. As a primary end point, treatment success was defined for each patient as relief of modified ROME criteria for constipation for 50% or more of their treatment weeks. Various secondary measures were also assessed. An interactive voice response system (IVRS) recorded patient reported daily bowel movement experience and study efficacy and safety information.

Results

A total of 237 patients were enrolled and received treatment at one of 25 centers. Successful treatment according to the primary end point was seen in 50.0% of the PEG and 30.8% of tegaserod patients (P= 0.003). By treatment weeks 3 and 4, significantly more PEG patients were successfully treated according to primary and secondary response definitions. PEG patients experienced more bowel movements per week (P= 0.019) and had significantly greater improvement in constipation symptoms (P= 0.016) based on results from a validated patient self-reported questionnaire. Tegaserod patients experienced a significantly higher incidence of headaches. Otherwise, there were no significant differences in adverse events.

Conclusions

While PEG laxative and tegaserod are safe for their intended use in chronic constipation, PEG had superior efficacy, caused fewer headaches, and produced greater improvement of constipation symptoms.

### Polyethylene glycol 3350 with electrolytes versus polyethylene glycol 4000 for constipation: a randomized, controlled trial [^7b90dc7d]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2018). Low credibility.

Sample Size

Assuming equality, with for each group an estimated mean TSS of 7.5 with a SD of 2.4, a sample size of 41 evaluable subjects per treatment group was required to demonstrate noninferiority of 2 treatment groups with a power of 80% (β = 0.2), a significance level of 0.05 (α = 0.05) and a noninferiority margin of an absolute difference in TSS score of 1.5.

Missing Data

If ≤2 of 5 TSS components were missing, it was assumed that the respective symptoms did not occur. If >2 of 5 constipation-related symptoms were missing, the TSS of that week was considered missing. Subjects with insufficient data to calculate the TSS at baseline were excluded from the PP population. In analyses of treatment success, subjects with missing data were considered treatment failures.

### Polyethylene glycol 3350 with electrolytes versus polyethylene glycol 4000 for constipation: a randomized, controlled trial [^0bf92cdd]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2018). Low credibility.

Presently, head-to-head data comparing different PEG formulations for treatment of childhood constipation are lacking. Furthermore, it is unknown whether PEG is safe and efficacious for long-term use in children.

Therefore, we aimed to investigate the noninferiority of PEG 3350 with electrolytes (PEG3350 + E) compared to PEG 4000 without electrolytes (PEG4000) with respect to constipation-related symptoms in children. Secondary aims were to compare efficacy, rates of adverse events, and average dose between the 2 agents during 1 year of treatment.

### Polyethylene glycol 3350 with electrolytes versus polyethylene glycol 4000 for constipation: a randomized, controlled trial [^57651316]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

The long-term efficacy and safety of polyethylene glycol (PEG) in constipated children are unknown, and a head-to-head comparison of the different PEG formulations is lacking. We aimed to investigate noninferiority of PEG3350 with electrolytes (PEG3350+E) compared to PEG4000 without electrolytes (PEG4000).

Methods

In this double-blind trial, children aged 0.5 to 16 years with constipation, defined as a defecation frequency of <3 times per week, were randomized to receive either PEG3350+E or PEG4000. Primary outcomes were change in total sum score (TSS) at week 52 compared to baseline, and dose range determination. TSS was the sum of the severity of 5 constipation symptoms rated on a 4-point scale (0-3). Noninferiority margin was a difference in TSS of ≤1.5 based on a 95%-confidence interval [CI]. Treatment success was defined as a defecation frequency of ≥3 per week with <1 episode of fecal incontinence.

Results

Ninety-seven subjects were included, of whom 82 completed the study. Mean reduction in TSS was -3.81 (95% CI: -4.96 to -2.65) and -3.74 (95%CI: -5.08 to -2.40), for PEG3350+E and PEG4000, respectively. Noninferiority criteria were not met (maximum difference between groups: -1.81 to 1.68). Daily sachet use was: 0 to 2 years: 0.4 to 2.3 and 0.9 to 2.1; 2 to 4 years: 0.1 to 3.5 and 1.2 to 3.2; 4 to 8 years: 1.1 to 2.8 and 0.7 to 3.8; 8 to 16 years 0.6 to 3.7 and 1.0 to 3.7, in PEG3350+E and PEG4000, respectively. Treatment success after 52 weeks was achieved in 50% and 45% of children, respectively (P=0.69). Rates of adverse events were similar between groups, and no drug-related serious adverse events occurred.

Conclusions

Noninferiority regarding long-term constipation-related symptoms of PEG3350+E compared to PEG4000 was not demonstrated. However, analysis of secondary outcomes suggests similar efficacy and safety of these agents.

PRECAUTIONS:

General: Patients with impaired gag reflex, unconscious, or semiconscious patients, and patients prone to regurgitation or aspiration should be observed during the administration of PEG-3350 and Electrolytes for Oral Solution, especially if it is administered via nasogastric tube. If a patient experiences severe bloating, distention or abdominal pain, administration should be slowed or temporarily discontinued until the symptoms abate. If gastrointestinal obstruction or perforation is suspected, appropriate studies should be performed to rule out these conditions before administration of PEG-3350 and Electrolytes for Oral Solution.

Information for patients: PEG-3350 and Electrolytes for Oral Solution produces a watery stool which cleanses the bowel before examination. Prepare the solution according to the instructions on the bottle. It is more palatable if chilled. For best results, no solid food should be consumed during the 3 to 4 hour period before drinking the solution, but in no case should solid foods be eaten within 2 hours of taking PEG-3350 and Electrolytes for Oral Solution.

Drink 240 mL (8 oz.) every 10 minutes. Rapid drinking of each portion is better than drinking small amounts continuously. The first bowel movement should occur approximately one hour after the start of PEG-3350 and Electrolytes for Oral Solution administration. You may experience some abdominal bloating and distention before the bowels start to move. If severe discomfort or distention occur, stop drinking temporarily or drink each portion at longer intervals until these symptoms disappear. Continue drinking until the watery stool is clear and free of solid matter. This usually requires at least 3 liters and it is best to drink all of the solution. Any unused portion should be discarded.

Drug Interactions: Oral medication administered within one hour of the start of administration of PEG-3350 and Electrolytes for Oral Solution may be flushed from the gastrointestinal tract and not absorbed.

Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility: Carcinogenic and reproductive studies with animals have not been performed.

Pregnancy: Category C. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with PEG-3350 and Electrolytes for Oral Solution. It is also not known whether PEG-3350 and Electrolytes for Oral Solution can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproductive capacity. PEG-3350 and Electrolytes for Oral Solution should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed. Pediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness in children have not been established.

### Miralax with gatorade for bowel preparation: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^4fbb296f]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Objectives

Polyethylene glycol (PEG) is a very popular bowel preparation for colonoscopy. However, its large volume may reduce patient compliance, resulting in suboptimal preparation. Recently, a combination of Miralax and Gatorade has been studied in various randomized controlled trials (RCTs) as a lower volume and more palatable bowel preparation. However, results have varied. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis assessing the use of Miralax-Gatorade (M-G) vs. PEG for bowel preparation before colonoscopy.

Methods

Multiple databases were searched (January 2014). RCTs on adults comparing M-G (238-255g in 1.9l that is 64fl oz) vs. PEG (3.8-4l) for bowel preparation before colonoscopy were included. The effects were analyzed by calculating pooled estimates of quality of bowel preparation (satisfactory, unsatisfactory, excellent), patient tolerance (nausea, cramping, bloating), and polyp detection by using odds ratio (OR) with fixed- and random-effects models.

Results

Five studies met inclusion criteria (N=1,418), with mean age ranging from 53.8 to 61.3 years. M-G demonstrated statistically significantly fewer satisfactory bowel preparations as compared with PEG (OR 0.65; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.43-0.98, P=0.04) but more willingness to repeat preparation (OR 7.32; 95% CI: 4.88-10.98, P<0.01). Furthermore, no statistically significant differences in polyp detection (P=0.65) or side effects were apparent between the two preparations for nausea (P=0.71), cramping (P=0.84), or bloating (P=0.50). Subgroup analysis revealed similar results for split-dose M-G vs. split-dose PEG.

Conclusions

M-G for bowel preparation before colonoscopy was inferior to PEG in bowel preparation quality while demonstrating no significant improvements in adverse effects or polyp detection. Therefore, PEG appears superior to M-G for bowel preparation before colonoscopy.

### Polyethylene glycol 3350 with electrolytes versus polyethylene glycol 4000 for constipation: a randomized, controlled trial [^b7c1898a]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2018). Low credibility.

Protocol

Eligible subjects recorded a bowel diary 1 week before the start of the study medication to assess gastrointestinal symptoms at baseline. In this week, the use of laxatives was not allowed. When baseline assessment confirmed a defecation frequency <3 times per week, subjects were randomized.

During the first 3 days of treatment, all subjects received a rectal enema once daily for 3 consecutive days to remove any rectal fecal impaction. Subjects ages 6 months to 3 years received enemas of 5 mL containing 45 mg of sodium laurylsulfoacetate, 450 mg of sodium citrate, and 3.125 g of sorbitol (Microlax, Johnson & Johnson Consumer b.v. Amersfoort, the Netherlands). Subjects ages 3 to 6 years received enemas of 60 mL containing 60 mg sodium docusate and 15 g sorbitol. Subjects older than 6 years received enemas of 120 mL containing 120 mg of sodium docusate and 30 g of sorbitol.

On the fourth day of treatment, subjects started with either PEG3350 + E (Transipeg, Bayer Consumer Care AG, Basel, Switzerland) or PEG4000 (Forlax, Zambon, Amersfoort, the Netherlands). PEG4000 sachets contained 4 g of PEG with a molecular weight of 4000 g/mol. PEG3350 + E sachets contained 2.95 g of PEG with a molecular weight of 3350 g/mol and electrolytes: 37.5 mg potassium chloride, 73 mg sodium chloride, 284 mg sodium sulfate, and 84 mg sodium hydrogen carbonate.

Participants younger than 2 years initially received 1 sachet per day. Participants older than 2 years initially received 2 sachets per day. The dose could be adjusted based on individual titration during the follow-up visits, with a maximum of 4 sachets per day. When defecation did not occur within 3 consecutive days, rescue medication was allowed. In children younger than 6 years, rescue medication was an enema (as described above). In older children, rescue medication was either an enema or an oral dose of 5-mg bisacodyl. In total, 8 visits were scheduled (weeks 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 26, and 52 after enrollment).

5.4 Renal Impairment

Use caution when prescribing PEG-3350, sodium chloride, sodium bicarbonate and potassium chloride for oral solution for patients with impaired renal function or patients taking concomitant medications that may affect renal function (such as diuretics, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs). Advise these patients of the importance of adequate hydration, and consider performing baseline and post-colonoscopy laboratory tests (electrolytes, creatinine, and BUN) in these patients.

5.5 Colonic Mucosal Ulcerations and Ischemic Colitis

Administration of osmotic laxative products may produce colonic mucosal aphthous ulcerations, and there have been reports of more serious cases of ischemic colitis requiring hospitalization. Concurrent use of stimulant laxatives and PEG-3350, sodium chloride, sodium bicarbonate and potassium chloride for oral solution may increase this risk. The potential for mucosal ulcerations resulting from the bowel preparation should be considered when interpreting colonoscopy findings in patients with known or suspect inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).

5.6 Use in Patients with Significant Gastrointestinal Disease

If gastrointestinal obstruction or perforation is suspected, perform appropriate diagnostic studies to rule out these conditions before administering PEG-3350, sodium chloride, sodium bicarbonate and potassium chloride for oral solution. If a patient experiences severe bloating, distention or abdominal pain, administration should be slowed or temporarily discontinued until the symptoms abate. If gastrointestinal obstruction or perforation is suspected, appropriate studies should be performed to rule out these conditions before administration of PEG-3350, sodium chloride, sodium bicarbonate and potassium chloride for oral solution.

Use with caution in patients with severe active ulcerative colitis.

5.4 Renal Impairment

Use caution when prescribing PEG-3350 and electrolytes for oral solution for patients with impaired renal function or patients taking concomitant medications that may affect renal function (such as diuretics, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. Advise these patients of the importance of adequate hydration, and consider performing baseline and post-colonoscopy laboratory tests (electrolytes, creatinine, and BUN) in these patients [see Use is Specific Populations (8.6)]

5.5 Colonic Mucosal Ulcerations and Ischemic Colitis

Administration of osmotic laxative products may produce colonic mucosal aphthous ulcerations, and there have been reports of more serious cases of ischemic colitis requiring hospitalization. Concurrent use of stimulant laxatives and PEG-3350 and electrolytes for oral solution may increase this risk. Consider the potential for mucosal ulcerations resulting from the bowel preparation when interpreting colonoscopy findings in patients with known or suspect inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).

5.6 Use in Patients with Significant Gastrointestinal Disease

If gastrointestinal obstruction or perforation is suspected, perform appropriate diagnostic studies to rule out these conditions before administering PEG-3350 and electrolytes for oral solution. If a patient experiences severe bloating, distention or abdominal pain, administration should be slowed or temporarily discontinued until the symptoms abate. If gastrointestinal obstruction or perforation is suspected, appropriate studies should be performed to rule out these conditions before administration of PEG-3350 and electrolytes for oral solution.

Use with caution in patients with severe active ulcerative colitis.

5.7 Aspiration

Use with caution in patients with impaired gag reflex, unconscious, or semiconscious patients, and patients prone to regurgitation or aspiration. Observe these patients during administration of PEG-3350 and electrolytes for oral solution, especially if it is administered via nasogastric tube."

Do not combine PEG-3350 and electrolytes for oral solution with starch-based thickeners [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. Polyethylene glycol (PEG), a component of PEG-3350 and electrolytes for oral solution, when mixed with starch-thickened liquids reduces the viscosity of the starch-thickened liquid. When a PEG-based product used for another indication was mixed in starch-based pre-thickened liquids used in patients with dysphagia, thinning of the liquid occurred and cases of chocking and potential aspiration were reported.

### High-dose polyethylene glycol-3350 and gatorade solutions for patients with previous inadequate bowel preparations for colonoscopy are safe and effective [^f26d0ea5]. BMC Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

This study did not address the safety and efficacy of a Step 3 bowel preparation (2.5 times the standard-dose of PEG) since no subjects requiring this very high-dose preparation were seen during the recruitment period. Before this study began, we used protocols similar to Step 3 for a few patients who received PEG-ELS and MagCitrate. To date, we have not encountered a patient who had an inadequate Step 2 preparation (2.0 times the standard-dose of PEG). All our subjects used PEG and Gatorade as their bowel cleansing solutions; therefore, this study does not address the safety and efficacy of high doses of other bowel cleansing solutions.

There were some limitations to this study. (1) The study was not a randomized trial and subjects might be more careful to follow any cleansing protocol after a previous inadequate preparation. (2) Only 7 patients with renal insufficiency were enrolled. (3) The study was not blinded. (4) Historical controls were used.

### Efficacy and safety of a ready-to-drink bowel preparation for colonoscopy: a randomized, controlled, non-inferiority trial [^831553fa]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Eligibility criteria

Eligible participants included females and males, 18–80 years of age, who were undergoing elective colonoscopy. Females of childbearing potential must have agreed to use adequate contraception during the study and could not be pregnant or lactating at the time of enrollment.

Eligible participants must have had an average of at least three spontaneous bowel movements per week for 1 month prior to the colonoscopy, and be willing, able, and competent to complete the procedure and comply with study instructions. Written informed consent was obtained at screening.

Exclusion criteria included known or suspected major gastrointestinal (GI) disorder, including GI obstruction, perforation, ileus, severe acute inflammatory bowel disease, or diverticulitis; chronic nausea and vomiting; participants who were undergoing colonoscopy for foreign body removal or decompression; prior upper GI surgery; prior colorectal surgery (excluding appendectomy, hemorrhoid surgery, or endoscopic procedures); severely reduced renal function (<30 ml/min/1.73m 2); or uncontrolled angina or myocardial infarction within the last 3 months, congestive heart failure, uncontrolled hypertension, or ascites.

Use of certain medications was prohibited during the study: lithium (potential constipating agent); laxatives (within 24 h prior to colonoscopy), constipating drugs such as opiates, anticholinergics, calcium-channel blockers, and clonidine (within 48 h prior to colonoscopy); antidiarrheals such as loperamide (within 72 h prior to colonoscopy); or oral iron preparations (within 1 week prior to colonoscopy).

Participants eligible to participate in this study met similar inclusion/exclusion criteria to those eligible for two randomized controlled trials that established the efficacy of P/MC powder versus PEG-3350 with bisacodyl tablets for colon cleansing before colonoscopy.

Randomization

Participants were randomized according to a list that was computer generated by an independent, unblinded statistician prior to the first participant’s enrollment. Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive either SPMC oral solution or P/MC powder, and stratified by study site and whether or not they participated in the pharmacokinetic subgroup. Randomization numbers were allocated sequentially to participants at each site, in the order of enrollment.

An unblinded study coordinator enrolled participants electronically, distributed the assigned drug, and instructed the participant and caregiver(s) about the use of the bowel preparation, including dietary restrictions. The endoscopist performing the colonoscopy and assessing efficacy was blinded to the participant’s treatment group.

Physician-reported approach to RBL administration

Most participants (n = 35; 85.4%) were given osmotically acting laxatives (e.g. polyethylene glycol (PEG) 3350, PEG 3350/potassium chloride/sodium bicarbonate/sodium chloride/sodium sulfate) and 23 (56.1%) were given contact laxatives (e.g. bisacodyl, citric acid/magnesium oxide/sodium picosulfate) for bowel preparation prior to RBL. Two participants (4.9%) received loperamide. A more detailed description of bowel preparation medications can be found in the. With respect to RBL administration, a commonly reported approach involved cutting the product bag and drawing up the thawed suspension into syringes to inject via the colonoscope. Forty participants (97.6%) received RBL in the right side of the colon (cecum or ascending colon), while one participant (2.4%) received RBL in the sigmoid colon.

Thirty-one participants (75.6%) received the full 150-mL RBL dose with no product loss, 9 (22.0%) experienced a small amount of product loss (1–25 mL), and 1 participant experienced a moderate amount of product loss (26–50 mL). The amount of RBL received did not have an impact on treatment success rates.

### Polyethylene glycol 3350 with electrolytes versus polyethylene glycol 4000 for constipation: a randomized, controlled trial [^dedf64a9]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2018). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

The primary aim of this study was to evaluate whether PEG3350 + E was noninferior to PEG4000 with respect to long-term constipation-related symptoms in children with constipation. The primary endpoint was not met and thus noninferiority of PEG3350 + E versus PEG4000 was not demonstrated. Consequently, we cannot rule out that PEG3350 + E is inferior to PEG4000. However, there are 2 potential other reasons why noninferiority criteria were not met. First, standard deviations of the change in the primary outcome were larger than expected, leading to a lower statistical power than anticipated. Second, the PP population, in which the primary outcome was assessed, was smaller than anticipated, owing to a large number of subjects with insufficient baseline data. Indeed, noninferiority criteria were met if the number of evaluable subjects per group was the anticipated 41 (assuming no change in means and standard deviations; data not shown). No difference between the treatment arms was found with respect to constipation symptoms, treatment success, and adverse events, suggesting that both treatments are likely to have similar long-term efficacy and safety.

No difference was found in the mean daily number of sachets used. However, the mean daily dose of PEG relative to body weight was significantly lower in subjects receiving PEG3350 + E compared to subjects receiving PEG4000. Furthermore, older subjects used significantly lower doses of PEG relative to body weight in both treatment groups. These findings suggest that the recommended starting dose of PEG maintenance treatment of 0.4 g · kg −1 · day −1 may not be universally applicable, but instead depends on a subjects’ age or body weight, and the specific PEG formulation. To our knowledge, no previous head-to-head comparisons between various PEG formulations have been performed in children.

Duration of treatment was shorter in subjects receiving PEG3350 + E compared to subjects receiving PEG4000, potentially indicating that PEG3350 + E could successfully be tapered and stopped earlier in the course of treatment. It may, however, also reflect that subjects receiving PEG4000 were less eager to taper and stop the treatment, because PEG4000 may be more palatable than PEG3350 + E.

Methods

Trial design

This was a two-part, randomized, Phase 2 study, conducted at the PAREXEL clinical trial unit in Berlin, Germany (for registration/protocol see:NCT01714466; EudraCT 2012–003052-37). Part 1 of the study was open-label and conducted in healthy volunteers who did not require a colonoscopy. It aimed to assess the pharmacodynamics (stool output); and to establish a suitable administration sequence for the two doses, the reconstitution volume and the required additional fluid volume. Proof of concept was assessed in Part 2: in patients undergoing a screening colonoscopy. This Part was endoscopist-blinded (the endoscopist was unaware of the preparation administered) and used a validated bowel cleansing scale to assess cleansing quality. Safety and tolerability were assessed in both study Parts.

The study was approved by the Local Independent Ethics Committee and performed according to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, the Guidelines of the International Conference on Harmonization on Good Clinical Practice, and the European Union Clinical Trials Directive.

Eligibility

In Part 1, healthy male and female subjects aged 40 to 70 years were enrolled. Subjects were ineligible if they had a history of clinically significant gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms or current acute abdominal discomfort or symptoms. In Part 2, enrolled patients were scheduled to undergo a screening colonoscopy and they were either 40 to 70 years old with a known personal or familial risk of contracting CRC, or 55 to 70 years old. Women of child-bearing potential were required to use adequate contraception. Full exclusion criteria are provided in Additional file 1 : Table S1. In summary, the main exclusion criteria were: presence of current, clinically significant, functional GI disorder (e.g. gastric emptying disorder, chronic constipation, irritable bowel syndrome); regular use of laxatives or colon motility altering drugs in the last month before study drug administration; any history or current presence of ileus, GI obstruction or perforation, GI tract cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, or colonic resection; and history or evidence of any clinically significant cardiovascular or neurological disease, or cardiac, renal, or hepatic insufficiency. Subjects were also ineligible if they had any clinically relevant physical findings or deviations of laboratory parameters. For all subjects, ferrous sulfate was stopped at least 1 week prior to study medication.

### Polyethylene glycol 3350 and docusate sodium compared with docusate sodium alone after urogynecologic surgery: a randomized controlled trial [^c2991b30]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare time to first bowel movement and additional gastrointestinal outcomes between women receiving polyethylene glycol 3350 (PEG3350) and docusate sodium and docusate sodium alone after urogynecologic surgery.

Methods

Participants received twice-daily 100 mg docusate sodium and were randomized to daily 1) PEG3350 or 2) inert placebo for 5 days after urogynecologic surgery. They completed bowel diaries, Bristol stool scale, validated Patient Assessment of Constipation Symptom Questionnaire, and Patient Assessment of Constipation Quality-of-Life Questionnaire preoperatively and 1 week after surgery. Our primary outcome was time to first bowel movement after surgery. To detect a 1-day difference in time to first bowel movement (4 compared with 3 days), 63 participants were needed in each group.

Results

From September 2012 through March 2015, 145 women were randomized and 131 (90%) analyzed: 66 received PEG3350, and 65 received placebo. Polyethylene glycol 3350 did not significantly reduce time to first bowel movement after surgery compared with placebo (2.77 days [interquartile range 1.86-3.40] compared with 2.92 days [interquartile range 1.85-4.02] P=.25). Women in the PEG3350 group were less likely to take additional laxatives postoperatively, and the PEG3350 group was more adherent to the study drug regimen. Questionnaire scores, fecal incontinence, and urgency were similar between groups.

Conclusion

In women taking routine docusate sodium after urogynecologic surgery, adding PEG3350 postoperatively did not reduce time to first bowel movement.

Outcome Assessment

During the first 12 weeks of the study, and the weeks before the visits at week 26 and 52, parents or legal representatives recorded the following in daily diaries: defecation frequency, stool consistency, fecal incontinence frequency, and adverse events. Furthermore, for subjects younger than 2 years, diaries were used to score the following 5 constipation-related symptoms on a 4-point scale (0 = none, 1 = mild/sometimes, 2 = moderate/regular, and 3 = severe/often): crying attributed to abdominal pain/cramps; diarrhea; flatulence; crying during defecation; redness attributed to straining during defecation. For subjects older than 2 years, diaries were used to score the following symptoms on the same scale: abdominal pain/cramps; diarrhea; flatulence; painful defecation; straining at defecation. The Total Sum Score (TSS) was calculated as the sum of the scores of the respective 5 constipation-related symptoms, ranging from 0 to 15 points, with higher scores reflecting more (severe) symptoms.

There were 2 primary outcomes: the change in TSS at week 52 compared to baseline, and dose range determination, calculated as the number of sachets used per patient per day per age group. Secondary outcomes included the proportion of subjects with treatment success (defined as a defecation frequency >3 times per week and <1 episodes of fecal incontinence per week), defecation frequency, stool consistency (hard, normal, soft, or watery) and fecal incontinence frequency. Duration of treatment was calculated as the number of days from inclusion to the date of last intake of study medication. If the date of last intake of study medication was not available (eg, if the subject was lost to follow-up), the last visit date was used instead. Safety was assessed by evaluating the number of (serious) adverse events. Whether an adverse event was considered to be drug-related was determined by the reporting local investigator based on the temporal sequence from drug administration, the recovery on discontinuation and the recurrence on reintroduction of study medication, underlying, concomitant or intercurrent diseases, concomitant medication or treatment, and the pharmacology and pharmacokinetics of the study medication.

5.4 Renal Impairment

Use caution when prescribing GaviLyte-N for patients with impaired renal function or patients taking concomitant medications that may affect renal function (such as diuretics, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs).  Advise these patients of the importance of adequate hydration, and consider performing baseline and post-colonoscopy laboratory tests (electrolytes, creatinine, and BUN) in these patients.

5.5 Colonic Mucosal Ulcerations and Ischemic Colitis

Administration of osmotic laxative products may produce colonic mucosal aphthous ulcerations, and there have been reports of more serious cases of ischemic colitis requiring hospitalization. Concurrent use of stimulant laxatives and GaviLyte-N may increase this risk. The potential for mucosal ulcerations resulting from the bowel preparation should be considered when interpreting colonoscopy findings in patients with known or suspect inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).

5.6 Use in Patients with Significant Gastrointestinal Disease

If gastrointestinal obstruction or perforation is suspected, perform appropriate diagnostic studies to rule out these conditions before administering GaviLyte-N. If a patient experiences severe bloating, distention or abdominal pain, administration should be slowed or temporarily discontinued until the symptoms abate. If gastrointestinal obstruction or perforation is suspected, appropriate studies should be performed to rule out these conditions before administration of GaviLyte-N. Use with caution in patients with severe active ulcerative colitis.

5.7 Aspiration

Use with caution in patients with impaired gag reflex, unconscious, or semiconscious patients, and patients prone to regurgitation or aspiration.  Such patients should be observed during administration of GaviLyte-N, especially if it is administered via nasogastric tube.

Do not combine GaviLyte- N with starch-based thickeners [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. Polyethylene glycol (PEG), a component of GaviLyte - N, when mixed with starch-thickened liquids reduces the viscosity of the starch-thickened liquid. When a PEG-based product used for another indication was mixed in starch-based pre-thickened liquids used in patients with dysphagia, thinning of the liquid occurred and cases of choking and potential aspiration were reported.

5.8 Not for Direct Ingestion

The contents of each jug must be diluted with water to a final volume of 4 liters (4 L) and ingestion of additional water is important to patient tolerance. Direct ingestion of the undissolved powder may increase the risk of nausea, vomiting, dehydration, and electrolyte disturbances.

### Utilisation and safety of polyethylene glycol 3350 with electrolytes in children under 2 years: a retrospective cohort [^43860fa0]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2021). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

This utilisation and safety study was conducted to characterise the paediatric population and use of PEG 3350+E in a cohort first prescribed treatment younger than 2 years of age. The safety aspect of this study did not identify any signals of concern in the constipation cohort. Patient numbers in the faecal impaction cohort were too small to draw robust conclusions on safety. If information were available, then a safety study would ideally assess treatment intake per kilogram, including electrolyte intake, before reaching safety conclusions. Nevertheless, findings from this study contribute to real-world evidence on the use of PEG 3350+E in this population, in countries where the product is available.

### Dose response of PEG 3350 for the treatment of childhood fecal impaction [^5883b712]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate the efficacy and safety of polyethylene glycol (PEG) 3350 in the treatment of childhood fecal impaction.

Methods

This was a prospective, double-blind, parallel, randomized study of 4 doses of PEG 3350; 0.25 g/kg per day, 0.5 g/kg per day, 1 g/kg per day, 1.5 g/kg per day, given for 3 days in children with constipation for >3 months and evidence of fecal impaction.

Results

Forty patients completed the study (27 boys, median age 7.5, range 3.3-13.1 years). Disimpaction occurred in 75% of children, with a significant difference between the two higher doses and the lower doses (95% vs 55%, P <.005). All groups had an increased number of bowel movements during the 5-day study versus baseline, respectively: 6.5 versus 1.1 (P <.005), 8.0 versus 1.3 (P <.005), 10.9 versus 1.7 (P <.005), and 12.3 versus 1.4 (P <.005). Adverse effects included nausea (5%), vomiting (5%), bloating (18%), cramping (5%), and diarrhea (13%). Diarrhea and bloating were more prevalent (P <.02) in the higher-dose than in the lower-dose group. No clinically significant changes in electrolytes were noted.

Conclusions

The 3-day administration of PEG 3350 is safe and effective in the treatment of childhood fecal impaction at doses of 1 and 1.5 g/kg per day.

### A phase 2 evaluation of a new flavored peg and sulfate solution compared to an over-the-counter laxative, peg and sports drink bowel preparation combination [^d3fe6e64]. BMC Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Methods

This was an open-label, active-controlled, sequential-cohort study in adult patients undergoing colonoscopy for colorectal cancer screening and surveillance or for diagnostic purposes. This study was conducted at 4 U.S. endoscopy centers and approved by Aspire, Institutional Review Board and registered on(NCT03328507) on 01/11/2017. The investigation conformed with the principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki. Subjects with known or suspected ileus, severe ulcerative colitis, gastrointestinal obstruction, gastric retention, bowel perforation, toxic colitis or megacolon or who had previous significant gastrointestinal surgeries were excluded. Also excluded were patients with uncontrolled pre-existing electrolyte abnormalities, uncontrolled hypertension, known severe hepatic insufficiency (Child Pugh C), and subjects with cardiac insufficiency (NYHA Functional Classifications 3 or 4).

A screening visit was performed for eligible patients within 30 days prior to their scheduled colonoscopy which included routine blood chemistry. In this adaptive design study conducted over a two-year period, twenty subjects were planned to take the PEG-SD control, with various experimental formulations concurrently and subsequently evaluated (not discussed here) with 40 subjects ultimately planned to take the FPSS to-be-marketed formulation. Preparation administration was not randomized.

On the day prior to colonoscopy, subjects were allowed a low residue breakfast followed by clear liquids until the colonoscopy was completed the following day. Both preparations were administered using the American College of Gastroenterology recommended split-dose (PM/AM) regimen. Subjects assigned to FPSS reconstituted the one-liter dose with water on the evening prior to colonoscopy and consumed 8 oz of solution every 15 min until complete. A second one-liter dose was taken the morning of colonoscopy. FPSS subjects drank an additional 16oz of water following each preparation dose. Subjects assigned to PEG-SD received two 5 mg over-the-counter bisacodyl laxative tablets, two 32-ounce bottles of Lemon-Lime flavored sports drink (Gatorade; PepsiCo, Inc. Chicago, IL, USA), and two 119 g bottles of Polyethylene glycol 3350 (PEG 3350). Subjects were instructed to take the bisacodyl at approximately 3PM on the day prior to colonoscopy. Subjects then mixed one bottle of PEG 3350 with one bottle of Gatorade and consumed 8 oz every 15 min until complete, along with additional water. A second one-liter dose was taken the morning of colonoscopy.

### Benefits and harms of adhesion barriers for abdominal surgery: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^8bf011d1]. Lancet (2014). Excellent credibility.

Background

Formation of adhesions after peritoneal surgery results in high morbidity. Barriers to prevent adhesion are seldom applied, despite their ability to reduce the severity of adhesion formation. We evaluated the benefits and harms of four adhesion barriers that have been approved for clinical use.

Methods

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched PubMed, CENTRAL, and Embase for randomised clinical trials assessing use of oxidised regenerated cellulose, hyaluronate carboxymethylcellulose, icodextrin, or polyethylene glycol in abdominal surgery. Two researchers independently identified reports and extracted data. We compared use of a barrier with no barrier for nine predefined outcomes, graded for clinical relevance. The primary outcome was reoperation for adhesive small bowel obstruction. We assessed systematic error, random error, and design error with the error matrix approach. This study is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42012003321.

Findings

Our search returned 1840 results, from which 28 trials (5191 patients) were included in our meta-analysis. The risks of systematic and random errors were low. No trials reported data for the effect of oxidised regenerated cellulose or polyethylene glycol on reoperations for adhesive small bowel obstruction. Oxidised regenerated cellulose reduced the incidence of adhesions (relative risk [RR] 0·51, 95% CI 0·31-0·86). Some evidence suggests that hyaluronate carboxymethylcellulose reduces the incidence of reoperations for adhesive small bowel obstruction (RR 0·49, 95% CI 0·28-0·88). For icodextrin, reoperation for adhesive small bowel obstruction did not differ significantly between groups (RR 0·33, 95% CI 0·03-3·11). No barriers were associated with an increase in serious adverse events.

Interpretation

Oxidised regenerated cellulose and hyaluronate carboxymethylcellulose can safely reduce clinically relevant consequences of adhesions.

Funding

PEG-3350 (2 L) + bisacodyl—Across recent studies, regimens using bisacodyl with 4 L PEG-ELS showed no difference in bowel preparation quality but superior tolerability compared with larger-volume PEG regimens; safety concerns include rare occurrences of ischemic colitis. Additionally, it is important to mix a sports drink with the PEG-3350, and this over-the-counter PEG-3350 approach, though widely used, is not approved by the FDA for use as a bowel preparation regimen.

Summary

Small bowel obstructions (SBOs) due to intra-peritoneal adhesive disease are a common sequela of abdominal surgery. While reducing adhesions is a frequent therapeutic goal, it remains unclear whether adhesion reduction translates to decreased adhesive SBO rates. This study aimed to compare adhesive SBO rates following surgery with and without intra-peritoneal adhesion prophylactic agents use in adults.A systematic search was conducted in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, and Web of Science for English studies published between January 1, 2000, and February 15, 2024, reporting on SBOs following intra-peritoneal adhesion prophylactic agent application. Studies without primary data, non-clinical studies, reviews, commentaries, and editorials were excluded. A total of 9,262 unique titles were identified, of which ultimately 31 studies met inclusion criteria. Twelve randomized controlled trials and 14 observational studies were included in meta-analyses. Five studies were unable to be included in meta-analyses. Outcomes included SBO rates occurring less than (early) and greater than (late) 30 days post-operatively, and adverse event rates (anastomotic leak, intra-abdominal abscess, and wound infection).Five intra-peritoneal adhesion prophylactic agents were identified. Use of prophylactic agents reduced both early (1.1% vs 2.9%, odds ratio [OR] 0.40; 95% CI [0.21, 0.74]) and late (7.6% vs 9.9%, OR 0.76; 95% CI [0.60, 0.95]) SBO rates. On sub-analysis, Guardix®, but not Seprafilm, reduced late SBO rates (OR 0.34; 95% CI [0.19, 0.61]). Adverse events rates were comparable with and without use of a prophylactic agent. RCTs were rated as having a variable risk of bias and moderate certainty of evidence.In conclusion, intra-peritoneal adhesion prophylactic agents reduced SBO rates, however efficacy varied by agents. Further research is needed to refine clinical indications and assess long-term outcomes.

RESULTS

Subjects

Between April 2006 and December 2007, a total of 97 children (ITT population) were included and randomized, of whom 82 completed the study (Fig. 1). Follow-up was completed in December 2008. Reasons for withdrawal were lost to follow-up (n = 5), insufficient response (n = 2), consent withdrawal (n = 2), noncompliance (n = 1), and other (n = 5). Another 20 subjects were excluded from the PP population because of missing baseline data (n = 16), because of the use of laxatives up until inclusion (n = 2), or because of the use of rescue medication for >2 consecutive weeks, indicating nonresponse (n = 2). The PP population consisted of 62 subjects. Baseline characteristics in both the ITT population and the PP population were similar between groups (Table 1 and Supplemental Table 1, Supplemental Digital Content 1). Mean age at the onset of constipation was 23.9 (SD 30.5) months and 21.4 (SD 20.5) months in the PEG3350 + E and PEG4000 groups, respectively (P = 0.64; ITT population). Children younger than 2 years had a mean number of 1.2 (SD 1.1) and 1.6 (SD 0.5) bowel movements per week, in the PEG3350 + E and PEG4000 groups, respectively (ITT population). In children older than 2 years, the mean defecation frequency on the toilet was 1.6 (SD 0.8) and 1.2 (SD 0.9) in the PEG3350 + E and PEG4000 groups, respectively (ITT population). Almost all (99%) subjects fulfilled Rome III criteria for functional constipation (Supplemental Table 2, Supplemental Digital Content 2).

### A systematic review on diagnosis and treatment of gastrointestinal diseases by magnetically controlled capsule endoscopy and artificial intelligence [^5d8a6cb2]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Intestinal imaging

The intestine is a long and complex digestive tube that runs from the pylorus to the anus and so the capsule has a long retention time in the intestine. Air bubbles, mucus, bile, and food substances in the intestine can reduce the visualization of the intestine during capsule endoscopy. Due to delayed gastric emptying, the visualization of the intestine becomes incomplete if the capsule remains in the same part of the stomach or intestine for more than 4 h, resulting in poorer image quality.

Polyethylene glycol (PEG) is the most commonly used intestinal cleanser in capsule endoscopy.Other cleansers include magnesium citrate and Gatorade’s Miralax (polyethylene glycol 3350). Song et al.performed multiple randomized controlled trials with or without polyethylene glycol, using different doses, and under fasting and bowel cleansing, which showed that PEG solution enhanced the visualization quality of the small intestine but did not contribute to the visual integrity of the cecum and that bowel preparation with fasting or administration of PEG solution combined with dimethicone oil enhanced visualization. Thus, bowel cleansing prior to MCCE would help to improve the imaging quality of the images.

Excessive small bowel peristalsis or rapid transit can result in incomplete small bowel assessment or missed small bowel lesions, and imaging quality at some sites such as the proximal duodenum and jejunum can become poor.Kim et al.found that bile worsened fluid transparency as the capsule advanced through the intestine and that coffee enemas resulted in bile duct dilation and bile excretion through the colonic wall. Compared to patients who received only PEG, patients who received the combination of coffee enema and 2L PEG showed greater cleanliness in the distal intestine, and coffee enema improved bile-induced visual impairment in distal small bowel images, but there was no significant change in proximal cleanliness, so the quality of visualization of the proximal small bowel remains to be improved.

In addition, gender and small bowel transport time can also affect the image quality of capsule endoscopy. Ponte et al.evaluated the predictors of incomplete bowel examination and inadequate cleanliness in capsule endoscopy and showed that the male gender tends to imply more complications such as celiac disease, ulceration, and bleeding, which often lead to bowel complexity and thus affect the imaging quality, while increased bowel transport time can prevent the capsule from reaching the cecum in a timely manner, thus reducing the observed integrity of the bowel and increasing the probability of complications.

### Modifications in endoscopic practice for pediatric patients [^5e31d00f]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2014). Medium credibility.

Pediatric bowel preparation for colonoscopy—Sodium phosphate safety and polyethylene glycol (PEG)–based regimens are outlined: Black-box warnings and manufacturer guidance led to removal of oral sodium phosphate as an over-the-counter option and to recommend against use in “any children younger than 18 years of age.” If PEG with electrolytes is chosen, most children require approximately 80 mL/kg, and nasogastric administration for 24 hours before the procedure is described as safe and appropriate, especially in children younger than 6 years. For electrolyte‑free PEG‑3350, doses as much as 10 times higher than those for constipation are reported as emerging as the preparation of choice in many pediatric units, with studies supporting 4‑day regimens and conclusions that both 2‑day and 1‑day preparations are safe and effective.

### High-dose polyethylene glycol-3350 and gatorade solutions for patients with previous inadequate bowel preparations for colonoscopy are safe and effective [^4d2f971a]. BMC Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

An adequate bowel preparation for colonoscopy is necessary to visualize the mucosa and safely reach the cecum. Inadequate bowel cleansing remains an issue for up to 20% of those undergoing a colonoscopy resulting in a lower adenoma detection rate and added cost. Current guidelines recommend that "consideration should be given to prescribing more aggressive preparations in patients who have a history of inadequate preparation quality" but no standardized recommendations exist for the subsequent bowel preparation.

A high percentage of those who had a previous inadequate preparation for colonoscopy have a subsequent inadequate preparation. A retrospective study looked at 6990 patients of whom 307 (4.4%) had an inadequate preparation for colonoscopy. Of the 235 who had a subsequent colonoscopy, inadequate preparations occurred in 54 (23%) second colonoscopies, 10 of 38 (26%) third colonoscopies and 3 of 9 (33%) forth colonoscopies. This study was limited by the lack of data on how the initial inadequate preparations differed from those of the preparations used in the subsequent colonoscopies.

Two studies have examined "intensive" bowel preparations in those with previous inadequate preparations, but the "intensive" bowel preparations were no different than standard-dose regimens in use today and 10–33% of subjects had inadequate preparations with many of the "adequately" cleansed colons containing residual fecal material. No studies have investigated high-dose bowel preparations in this population.

In the United States, pure PEG-3350 powder is sold over-the-counter by the gram in sachets (packages) of 17 g or bottles ranging in size from 119 to 765 g for use as a laxative with a recommended dose of 17 g. PEG-3350 with electrolytes is sold by prescription for cleansing the colon for colonoscopy and is rarely used for constipation. In other parts of the world, PEG-4000 is sold as a laxative but there has never been a comparison of the osmotic effect of PEG-3350 vs. PEG-4000 when used a laxative in humans.

### Novel 1 L polyethylene glycol-based bowel preparation (NER1006): proof of concept assessment versus standard 2 L polyethylene glycol with ascorbate-a randomized, parallel group, phase 2, colonoscopist-blinded trial [^28e55c7c]. BMC Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Bowel preparation is a critical factor in the diagnostic and therapeutic success of colonoscopy and colorectal cancer (CRC) screening.

Bowel preparations based on polyethylene glycol 3350 (PEG3350) plus electrolyte solutions are well established. Ascorbic acid/sodium ascorbate (Asc), that is vitamin C, adds to the laxative effect of PEG3350 whilst also enabling a total volume reduction. The development of a 2 L PEG + Asc preparation halved the required preparation-volume intake versus older 4 L PEGs and thus represented a more convenient but still effective bowel preparation. As it was easier to complete, patients were more likely to be willing to undergo the procedure again if they received the 2 L PEG + Asc. However, even with 2 L PEG + Asc, a total-fluid-volume of 3 L should be ingested in a short time, and taking 2 L of a bowel preparation is still a challenge for some patients. Further volume reductions may thus help even more patients to successfully complete their bowel-preparations.

It was hypothesized that an effective low-volume bowel preparation could be achieved with an increased ascorbate amount/osmotic load. An initial clinical study exploring new low-volume PEG + Asc (LVPEG) split-dosing bowel preparations identified two test formulations suitable for further clinical investigation [data on file: Norgine]. The current study used taste- and flavor-optimized versions of these formulations to assess if they could repeat stool output achievements and demonstrate clinical proof of concept by achieving functional bowel cleansing.

### Comparison of the effectiveness of polyethylene glycol with and without electrolytes in constipation: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^443f1036]. BMC Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Polyethylene glycols were first used in lavage solutions in preparation for gastrointestinal interventions such as colonoscopy or bowel surgery. For this indication, they are given in high doses and are generally administered with electrolytes to reduce the risk of large electrolyte shifts. Later, lower doses were used for the management of constipation. More recent formulations were developed without electrolytes to reduce the sodium load, improve taste and potentially patient acceptance and compliance also.

The clinical effectiveness of polyethylene glycols in the management of constipation in adults is well established and confirmed in a recent meta-analysis by Belsey et al. This analysis demonstrated that polyethylene glycol is more effective than placebo and active comparators such as lactulose in the treatment of non-organic constipation. In this analysis however, all polyethylene glycol formulations were treated as the same and it did not provided any insight regarding the clinical utility of the addition of electrolytes to polyethylene glycol. In some countries PEG + E is more widely used than PEG for the management of constipation. The reasons for this are multifactorial and include the perception that PEG + E is a more effective treatment for constipation and safer in terms of preventing electrolyte imbalance. There however is a lack of evidence to support or refute these perceptions.

The objective of this systematic review and network meta-analysis (NMA) was to assess the relative effectiveness of polyethylene glycol with or without electrolytes in the management of functional constipation in adults. The primary end point was the difference in the mean number of bowel movements per week. Secondary endpoints relate to the relative safety, tolerability and compliance or willingness to continue polyethylene glycol therapy.

### Irritable bowel syndrome: a "mesh" of a situation [^505b99c0]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) frequently is made after the exclusion of a mechanical etiology for a patient's symptoms. This case demonstrates that IBS symptoms can be caused by a rare complication of a common surgery: mesh herniorrhaphy repair. The patient is a 50-year-old woman who underwent periumbilical Marlex mesh herniorrhaphy 13 years before presentation. After her operation, the patient developed constipation (approximately one bowel movement per week) alternating with diarrhea for approximately 10 years. An abdominal radiograph showed large amounts of stool, and after a normal colonoscopy the patient was diagnosed with IBS. The patient was treated with tegaserod (Zelnorm) and polyethylene glycol (MiraLAX), which did not palliate her symptoms. The patient presented with obstructive symptoms and physical findings of an incarcerated umbilical hernia. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen confirmed an umbilical hernia involving a segment of small bowel with surrounding fecalization of enteric contents. During operative repair, the patient was found to have Marlex mesh fully eroded into the lumen of the small bowel, causing a partial obstruction. The involved section of small bowel was resected, and during serial follow-up the patient had complete resolution of her IBS-like symptoms. A discussion follows regarding the implications of mesh migration, and questions are posed for future research.

### Bowel preparation for elective procedures in children: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^83b3c21d]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2017). Medium credibility.

What is already known on this topic?

Bowel preparation is vital to imaging and surgery in young people, but it is key to consider tolerability as well as efficacy in these patients.
Previous systematic reviews have only considered preparation for imaging and limit the age range, despite paediatricians often caring for children until older.

What this study hopes to add?

Despite many trials, there is much clinical heterogeneity and risk of bias concerns with the evidence base, as well as poor safety and tolerability reporting.
There is evidence that polyethylene glycol (PEG) regimens are effective. However, when compared, sodium picosulfate was better tolerated than PEG.
Future research needs to address these key methodology issues and also consider safety and tolerability as well as efficacy.

### Effect of polyethylene glycol electrolyte balanced solution on patients with acute colonic pseudo obstruction after resolution of colonic dilation: a prospective, randomised, placebo controlled trial [^fa182142]. Gut (2006). Low credibility.

Background and Aims

Conservative therapy for patients with acute colonic pseudo obstruction (Ogilvie's syndrome) may be successful initially but relapses are common. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of polyethylene glycol (PEG) electrolyte balanced solution on the relapse rate of the syndrome after initial resolution with neostigmine or endoscopic decompression.

Patients and Methods

The study was performed on 30 consecutive patients who presented with abdominal distension and radiographic evidence of colonic dilation, with a caecal diameter > or = 10 cm, that resolved conservatively. Patients then were randomised to receive daily 29.5 g of PEG (n = 15) or similar placebo (n = 15). Patients were monitored daily for a seven day period for stool and flatus evacuations, and colonic diameter on abdominal radiographs. Administration of the test solutions and assessment of patient symptoms and x rays were performed in a blinded fashion. A caecal diameter > or = 8 cm with a concomitant > or =10% increase after initial successful therapeutic intervention was considered as a relapse and these patients, after a second therapeutic intervention, were eligible to receive open label PEG.

Results

Twenty five patients received neostigmine as the initial therapeutic intervention which resulted in resolution of colonic dilation in 88% of cases. Eight patients had successful endoscopic decompression. Five (33.3%) patients in the placebo group had recurrent caecal dilation compared with none in the PEG group (p = 0.04). Therapy with PEG resulted in a significant increase in stool and flatus evacuations (p = 0.001 and 0.032, respectively) as well as in a significant decrease in the diameter of caecum, ascending and transverse colon, and abdominal circumference (p = 0.017, 0.018, 0.014, and 0.008, respectively).

Conclusions

Administration of PEG in patients with Ogilvie's syndrome after initial resolution of colonic dilation may increase the sustained response rate after initial therapeutic intervention.

### High-dose polyethylene glycol-3350 and gatorade solutions for patients with previous inadequate bowel preparations for colonoscopy are safe and effective [^19c3d81d]. BMC Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Another primary end point of this study was the safety of high doses of bowel cleansing preparations. The doses of PEG used as part of our Step 1 (459 g) and Step 2 (612 g) preparations are 1.5 to 2 times higher than our standard moderate split-dose of (306 g) PEG and Gatorade and 1.9 to 2.6 times higher than low doses (238 g to 255 g) of PEG and Gatorade. Unlike PEG-ELS, Gatorade is a hypotonic electrolyte solution (Table 1) and consuming 1.5 to 2.0 times the standard-dose of Gatorade might cause hyponatremia or hypokalemia.

When the baseline BMPs were compared to the BMPs drawn as the IV was started and after subjects had consumed their preparation (Table 6), there were no significant difference in any of the electrolytes, glucose or creatinine measurements but the BUN was significantly lower after the preparation. No subjects developed hyponatremia or hypokalemia. Subgroup analyses of the 7 subjects with elevated baseline creatinine between 1.30 mg/dl and 3.62 mg/dl found no significant difference in any of electrolytes, BUN or creatinine after the preparation with all having a lower BUN and 6 of 7 having a lower creatinine after the preparation.

### High-dose polyethylene glycol-3350 and gatorade solutions for patients with previous inadequate bowel preparations for colonoscopy are safe and effective [^cd1c9380]. BMC Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Step 1 (1.5 times the standard-dose of PEG) and Step 2 (2.0 times the standard-dose of PEG) preparations from our multi-step escalating high-dose extended cleansing protocol using PEG and Gatorade were highly efficacious, safe, well tolerated and well accepted by subjects whose previous colon preparations were inadequate.

This is the first prospective study looking at high-dose bowel preparation solutions for patients who previously had an inadequate bowel preparations for colonoscopy. Bowel preparation solutions have been sold in fixed-dose packages with a "one-size-fit-all" dosing approach for the past 40 years. With this study, we continue to show how the flexible dosing of PEG and Gatorade allows the needs of a diverse patient population to be met. Patients willing to consume a split-dose preparation do well with 306 g of PEG, patients who want a day-prior preparation require 357 g of PEG and we have observed patients with a history of a borderline inadequate preparation doing well with 374 g of PEG given as a spit-dose. Now we report 459 g of PEG given as an extended split-dose preparation works well for those who failed standard dose preparations and 612 g of PEG works well for those who failed 1.5 times the standard preparation.

Polyethylene glycol (PEG)—chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC) efficacy, safety, dose, and certainty are summarized as follows: PEG is approved at a dose of 17 g daily and is widely available OTC, and studies using PEG with and without electrolytes demonstrated greater efficacy in increasing CSBMs, SBMs, response rate, stool form, straining, and global relief vs placebo, with no abdominal pain. No conclusive statements could be made about risks of serious adverse events with PEG, and the overall certainty of evidence for PEG was moderate. Individuals treated with PEG may experience bloating, flatulence, and diarrhea, and it is stated that it is reasonable to use PEG earlier in the CIC management algorithm, either after or with fiber supplementation.

### Polyethylene glycol 3350 with electrolytes versus polyethylene glycol 4000 for constipation: a randomized, controlled trial [^9f5741d8]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2018). Low credibility.

One year after inclusion, approximately half of subjects in both groups were successfully treated. This appears to be somewhat lower than reported in most previous studies investigating the efficacy of PEG for childhood constipation, although reported response rates vary widely (,–). A potential explanation for the relatively low response rate may be our long follow-up compared to other studies, considering that a large proportion of children with constipation will eventually relapse after successful treatment. However, in the present study, therapeutic effect appeared to gradually increase over time. Furthermore, the response rate may also be an underestimation, resulting from conservative handling of missing data with respect to treatment success.

Recently, concerns have been raised regarding the long-term safety of PEG. Therefore, safety was an important secondary outcome of this study. Both PEG3350 + E and PEG4000 were well tolerated. Although the majority of subjects in both groups experienced an adverse event, only a small proportion of subjects experienced drug-related adverse events, and none of these were severe. Although these findings are reassuring, results from an ongoing study will help definitively determine whether long-term use of PEG in children is safe.

Strengths of our study are its prospective, randomized, double-blind, head-to-head nature and the long follow-up. To our knowledge, our study has the longest prospective follow-up of the efficacy and safety of laxatives in childhood constipation. A weakness is the high proportion of withdrawals and incomplete baseline data. Furthermore, Rome criteria—often considered a criterion standard for the diagnosis of pediatric functional constipation—were not used for the selection of subjects. However, almost all included subjects fulfilled Rome III criteria for functional constipation. Another limitation is that the TSS was used as a primary outcome measure, which has never been used previously. Indeed, the value of the TSS in determining the outcome of treatment for functional constipation remains to be determined. However, there is no consensus on how the efficacy of treatment for childhood constipation should be assessed, and a wide variety of outcome measures are used.

In conclusion, PEG3350 + E and PEG4000 are efficacious and well tolerated in the treatment of pediatric functional constipation. No significant differences with respect to efficacy and safety were found between both treatments. However, noninferiority of PEG3350 + E compared to PEG4000 regarding long-term constipation related symptoms could not be demonstrated, probably related to the small sample size.

### PEG3350 in the treatment of childhood constipation: a multicenter, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial [^ffe236ca]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To establish the efficacy and best starting dose of polyethylene glycol (PEG)3350 in the short-term treatment of children with functional constipation.

Study Design

Prospective, randomized, multicenter, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study of PEG3350 in children with functional constipation. Patients were randomly assigned to either placebo or 0.2 g/kg per day, 0.4 g/kg per day, or 0.8 g/kg per day of PEG3350 after a 1 week run-in period, followed by 2 weeks of treatment. All received behavior modification. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with a successful treatment response: >or=3 bowel movements (BM) in the second week.

Results

103 children (mean, 8.5 +/- 3.1 years) were enrolled. 77%, 74%, and 73% of the 0.2, 0.4, and 0.8 g/kg groups were successfully treated, as compared with 42% receiving placebo (P < .04). There was a significant increase in BM (P < .001) and straining improvement (P < .05) with the different PEG3350 doses. Stool consistency improved significantly for doses 0.4 g/kg or higher (P < .001). There was more abdominal pain and fecal incontinence in patients receiving 0.8 g/kg. PEG3350 was well tolerated.

Conclusions

This placebo-controlled study confirms the efficacy and safety of PEG3350 for the short-term treatment of children with functional constipation. We recommend a starting dose of 0.4 g/kg per day.

A total of 51 children were included in this randomised double-blind crossover study that was carried out in six paediatric outpatient centres.All were aged between 2 and 11 years and had at least a 3-month history of ⩽2 complete defaecations per week combined with one or more of the following: pain on defaecation on ⩾25% of days, ⩾25% of bowel movements with straining or ⩾25% of movements with hard/lumpy stools. Patients with current or previous faecal impaction were excluded, as were those taking high doses of stimulant laxatives with no effect.

Patients were randomised to receive either PEG 3350+electrolytes (PEG+E) for 2 weeks, followed by placebo, after a 2-week washout period, or the reverse. Dose was titrated according to age and response and ranged from one to nine 6.9 g PEG+E sachets daily. Randomisation was by computer allocation and blinding was maintained using a double dummy approach. The primary outcome measure was the number of complete defaecations per week.

At the end of 6 weeks, four children failed to provide sufficient bowel movement data for inclusion. Based on the remaining 47 participants, mean PEG dosage used was 0.6 g/kg in 2–6-year-old children and 0.7 g/kg in 7–11-year-old children. There was a significant difference in the number of complete defaecations: 3.12 vs 1.45, mean difference 1.64, p<0.001 and all defaecations 5.68 vs 4.10, mean difference 1.58, p = 0.003.

The authors also provided a per protocol analysis, which was restricted to those with at least 7 days of data from each treatment period and no concomitant laxative use. For this subgroup of 36 patients, the benefit was somewhat enhanced: mean defaecations 3.63 vs 1.63, mean difference 1.96, p<0.001.

### High-dose polyethylene glycol-3350 and gatorade solutions for patients with previous inadequate bowel preparations for colonoscopy are safe and effective [^e100828e]. BMC Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Three-step high-dose bowel preparation protocol (top) with the contents of the bowel preparations obtained from the package inserts (below) compared to 4 L SF PEG-ELS (NuLYTELY) and our standard preparation of 306 g PEG in 64 oz of Gatorade

Poorly Absorbed mOsm is estimated by adding the number of mOsms of Phosphate plus 2.2 multiplied by the mOsm of PEG. The actual number mOsm reaching the colon may differ from this estimate since some phosphate is absorbed and the effective osmolarity of PEG rises more than expected as its concentration increases. Water includes the volume of the preparation and any clear liquids required to be consumed with the preparation.

L indicates liters; mOsm, milliosmoles. SF, sulfate free; ELS, electrolyte solution; PEG, polyethylene glycol-3350

All patients were instructed to omit fruits and vegetables with seeds or foods that are high in fiber from their diet for 3 days-prior to their colonoscopy and to consume a clear liquid diet starting the day-prior (our standard dietary instructions for all patients undergoing colonoscopy). The patient instructions for the bowel preparations are provided in Additional file 1. A gastroenterologist provided face-to-face education on the bowel preparation protocol and the physician on-call was available to answer any questions during the preparation for all control subjects, the 59 subjects who had their previous inadequate preparation in our clinic and all subjects consuming a study preparation. It is unknown what education was received by the 10 subjects who had their previous inadequate preparation elsewhere.

The study was designed to include a total of up to 100 subjects, but recruitment would terminate after 5 years if at least 50 subjects had enrolled. A subject was allowed to withdraw from the study until the day-prior to their colonoscopy. Beginning the day-prior to the colonoscopy, all subjects were evaluated on an intention-to-treat basis no matter what bowel preparation they actually used. Subjects could be switched to another bowel cleaning regimen chosen by the physician on-call if they could not tolerate the one assigned to them.

A physician (DPG) was responsible for monitoring the data for any adverse outcomes.

Regarding surgical interventions for small bowel obstruction, more specifically with respect to adhesion barriers, WSES 2018 guidelines recommend to recognize that hyaluronate carboxymethylcellulose reduces adhesion formation and the risk of subsequent reoperations of adhesive SBO and its use seems cost-effective in open colorectal surgery.

### Treatment of faecal impaction with polyethelene glycol plus electrolytes (PGE + E) followed by a double-blind comparison of PEG + E versus lactulose as maintenance therapy [^3248398a]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2006). Low credibility.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy of polyethylene glycol 3350 plus electrolytes (PEG + E; Movicol) as oral monotherapy in the treatment of faecal impaction in children, and to compare PEG + E with lactulose as maintenance therapy in a randomised trial.

Patients and Methods

An initial open-label study of PEG + E in the inpatient treatment of faecal impaction (phase 1), followed by a randomised, double-blind comparison between PEG + E and lactulose for maintenance treatment of constipation over a 3-month period (phase 2) in children aged 2 to 11 years with a clinical diagnosis of faecal impaction.

Results

Disimpaction on PEG + E was achieved in 58 (92%) of 63 of children (89% of 2-4 year olds and 94% of 5-11 year olds) without additional interventions. A maximum dose of 4 sachets (for 2-4 year olds) or 6 sachets (for 5-11 year olds) was required; median time to disimpaction was 6 days (range, 3-7 days). Seven children (23%) reimpacted whilst taking lactulose, whereas no children reimpacted while taking PEG + E (P = 0.011). The total incidence rate of adverse events seen was higher in the lactulose group (83%) than in the PEG + E group (64%).

Conclusions

PEG + E is safe and highly effective in the management of childhood constipation. It allows a single orally administered laxative to be used for disimpaction without recourse to invasive interventions. It is significantly more effective than lactulose as maintenance therapy, both in efficacy in treating constipation and efficacy in preventing the recurrence of faecal impaction.
