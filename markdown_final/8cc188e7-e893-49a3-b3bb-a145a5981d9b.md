Post cardaic areest care

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about post-cardiac arrest care. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the immediate stabilization priorities after ROSC. Then, I should verify the current stance on targeted temperature management and fever prevention. Next, I will assess hemodynamic optimization and individualized MAP targets, followed by cardiac and non-cardiac etiologic evaluation. After that, I need to review neurological management, systemic supportive care, and prognostication timing. Finally, I should consider long-term secondary prevention, highlight key controversies and evidence gaps, and synthesize a concise algorithm, carefully cross-checking each point against high-credibility guidelines and statements as I go.

> Let me first confirm the immediate post-ROSC priorities — airway, breathing, circulation, and temperature monitoring — and ensure I'm not overstating the need for universal intubation; most comatose patients require airway control and mechanical ventilation, and oxygenation should avoid both hypoxia and hyperoxia with SpO2 typically targeted around 94–98% to limit secondary brain injury, while early invasive blood pressure and ECG monitoring are essential to avoid hypotension, with AHA 2020 guidance suggesting SBP ≥ 90 mmHg and MAP ≥ 65 mmHg as initial safeguards while more data-driven, individualized targets are determined, and continuous core temperature monitoring should begin immediately to enable fever prevention and temperature control policies in comatose survivors [^114Kiatt] [^112Aejuc] [^117WRogc] [^115RTjxQ].

> Wait, let me verify the temperature control stance because this is often misunderstood; the field has shifted from routine deep hypothermia toward active fever prevention and targeted normothermia, with ERC/ESICM 2022 recommending active fever prevention and continuous core temperature monitoring, and TTM2 demonstrating no advantage of 33°C over normothermia with fever prevention, so the practical emphasis is preventing temperatures above approximately 37.7°C, with optional TTM in the 32–36°C range if used, and avoiding active rewarming in spontaneously mildly hypothermic comatose patients after ROSC [^116Ep4nE] [^112Aejuc] [^114d6Q2B] [^1138yu45] [^114316K5].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of neuromuscular blockade; routine continuous NMB after ROSC has not shown benefit on lactate kinetics or outcomes, so it should not be used reflexively, but targeted, protocolized use is reasonable to suppress refractory shivering that threatens temperature targets, with SCCM guidance to couple NMB administration with structured assessment including peripheral nerve stimulation when used during therapeutic hypothermia, and I need to ensure we explicitly say to use the lowest effective dose and daily re-evaluation to minimize complications [^116Cgnbk] [^115VtwzW] [^116jhZ6p] [^116jhZ6p] [^111tu6tK] [^112veiqk].

> I will now examine hemodynamic optimization beyond the first few hours; post-arrest myocardial dysfunction is common yet not tightly correlated with survival or neurological outcome, so aggressive, supportive ICU care remains worthwhile, and I need to emphasize individualized MAP targets rather than fixed thresholds when feasible, leveraging echocardiography, markers of cardiac function, and where available, cerebrovascular autoregulation-guided approaches to approximate an optimal MAP that balances cerebral perfusion needs with cardiac strain in each patient [^117EBZMn] [^117WRogc] [^113HBNwP].

> Next, I should review metabolic and laboratory surveillance; serial lactate, blood gases, electrolytes — especially potassium and magnesium — and glucose are necessary, with prompt correction of derangements while avoiding extremes such as hypoglycemia and severe hyperglycemia, and I need to ensure we state a practical glycemic goal of roughly 140–180 mg/dL consistent with broad critical care practice and AHA statements, recognizing the limited arrest-specific certainty of evidence but the importance of preventing secondary insults [^117WRogc] [^115RTjxQ] [^114zDfCY].

> Let me consider the evaluation for cardiac etiology and timely intervention; if there is STEMI, immediate coronary angiography with PCI is indicated, while in patients without STEMI but with suspected ongoing ischemia or electrical instability, ESC 2022 supports emergency angiography, and I should confirm that ACC/AHA/SCAI endorse revascularization to improve survival in those with significant CAD presenting with VF/polymorphic VT or arrest, noting that for comatose non-STEMI survivors routine immediate angiography remains institution- and physiology-dependent and should be individualized [^115wxj7z] [^112xrzrw] [^117EBZMn].

> I need to check non-cardiac precipitants when the cause is unclear; ESC 2022 recommends considering brain and chest CT when clinical features, ECG, and echo do not localize a cardiac cause, and obtaining toxicology at presentation can be informative, particularly in younger or unexplained cases, while thorough evaluation for profound electrolyte disturbances, acid-base derangements, or endocrine crises should proceed in parallel to avoid missing reversible contributors [^111aExtT] [^113vEHMJ] [^114zDfCY].

> Next, I should review comprehensive neurological management throughout the ICU stay; maintain the chosen temperature strategy consistently for at least 24 hours with controlled rewarming, couple this with continuous EEG in comatose patients to detect and treat electrographic seizures, and keep sedation as light and short-acting as feasible to enable serial exams, while also acknowledging heterogeneity in post–cardiac arrest brain injury and the emerging rationale for phenotype-driven approaches to monitoring and therapy rather than one-size-fits-all strategies [^112Aejuc] [^117WRogc] [^1134uD8L] [^113hV24y].

> But wait, what about broader supportive care across organ systems; lung-protective ventilation with avoidance of both hyperoxia and hypocapnia/hypercapnia, early recognition and management of acute kidney injury, diligent line care and early sepsis detection in the context of post-arrest immune dysregulation, cautious glucose control avoiding hypoglycemia, and early enteral nutrition once stable are all integral, and I should confirm that these system-level measures are repeatedly emphasized in multidisciplinary statements because they mitigate secondary injury across the post–cardiac arrest syndrome [^117WRogc] [^115RTjxQ] [^113WtdwJ].

> I should double-check prognostication timing to avoid self-fulfilling bias; definitive neurological prognostication should be deferred for at least 72 hours after arrest, and longer if TTM, sedatives, or NMB could confound the exam, and a multimodal approach — clinical brainstem reflexes and motor response, EEG/SSEP, serum biomarkers such as NSE, and neuroimaging for diffuse anoxic injury — should be integrated rather than relying on any single test, with explicit caution against premature withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy [^117WRogc] [^115RTjxQ] [^1174BziC].

> Let me verify long-term management and secondary prevention; ICD implantation should be considered for survivors with appropriate indications such as ischemic cardiomyopathy with reduced EF, select non-ischemic etiologies including cardiac amyloidosis when meaningful survival exceeds one year, genetic arrhythmia syndromes like Brugada or high-risk early repolarization with syncope/family history, and coronary spasm, while structured cardiac rehabilitation and survivorship programs addressing cognitive and emotional sequelae are recommended, and I should note that regionalization to cardiac arrest centers has face validity though contemporary randomized data show neutral survival for expedited transfer in non-ST-elevation OHCA, so center selection should be individualized based on available capabilities [^113oQU8p] [^112tDbx1] [^111vG29m] [^114pfsd9] [^116CGoGa] [^115wZ6Ut].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions without acknowledging controversies and evidence gaps; temperature management priorities are shifting toward fever prevention and individualized use of TTM given neutral TTM2 results and lack of a clearly superior target temperature, blood pressure targets are moving from fixed thresholds to autoregulation-informed strategies where feasible, the timing and selection for coronary angiography in non-STEMI remain debated, routine neuromuscular blockade lacks supportive outcome data, and emerging PCABI phenotyping suggests that future trials and care pathways should be stratified to mechanism and severity, all within a literature base that often carries low certainty, necessitating protocolized yet adaptable care [^1138yu45] [^114316K5] [^113HBNwP] [^117EBZMn] [^1134uD8L] [^113hV24y].

> Let me synthesize a concise, time-based algorithm to ensure internal consistency: in the immediate 0–6 hours, secure airway and controlled oxygenation/ventilation, avoid hypotension with initial SBP ≥ 90 mmHg or MAP ≥ 65 mmHg while planning individualized targets, initiate continuous core temperature monitoring and active fever prevention, obtain ECG and early echo; in 6–24 hours, optimize hemodynamics and temperature control, evaluate for coronary angiography based on STEMI, ischemia, or instability, begin EEG monitoring in comatose patients; in 24–72 hours, maintain temperature strategy with controlled rewarming, lighten sedation to enable exam, and perform multimodal prognostication at or after 72 hours while avoiding premature WLST; for discharge planning, address ICD candidacy, rehabilitation, and survivorship follow-up, ideally within systems capable of comprehensive postarrest care [^114Kiatt] [^112Aejuc] [^117WRogc] [^114zDfCY].

Post-cardiac arrest care aims to prevent secondary injury and improve neurologic outcomes through **early, structured critical care**. Key priorities include **hemodynamic stabilization** (MAP ≥ 65 mmHg, SBP ≥ 90 mmHg) [^114Kiatt], targeted temperature management with strict fever prevention (maintain ≤ 37.5°C [^113qMPAW], avoid > 37.7°C) [^116Ep4nE], and early coronary angiography for suspected ischemia [^115wxj7z]. Ventilation should target **normoxia and normocapnia**, and seizures must be promptly treated. Multimodal neurologic prognostication should be delayed until ≥ 72 hours after rewarming or sedation clearance [^1174BziC]. Early ICU admission, continuous monitoring, and multidisciplinary care are essential to reduce secondary brain injury and improve survival with good neurologic function [^113HBNwP].

---

## Immediate stabilization and monitoring

- **Airway and breathing**: Secure airway and provide mechanical ventilation targeting normoxia (PaO2 75–100 mmHg) and normocapnia (PaCO2 35–45 mmHg) to prevent secondary brain injury.

- **Circulation**: Maintain MAP ≥ 65 mmHg and SBP ≥ 90 mmHg using fluids and vasopressors/inotropes as needed [^114Kiatt].

- **Continuous monitoring**: Implement continuous ECG, invasive arterial pressure, core temperature, and frequent neurologic assessments.

---

## Targeted temperature management (TTM)

- **Temperature control**: Maintain core temperature ≤ 37.5°C [^113qMPAW] and actively prevent fever (> 37.7°C) in comatose patients after ROSC [^116Ep4nE].

- **Cooling methods**: Use surface or endovascular devices; avoid active rewarming in mild hypothermia [^114d6Q2B].

- **Shivering management**: Treat shivering with sedation, analgesia, and neuromuscular blockade as needed [^112veiqk] [^114316K5].

---

## Hemodynamic optimization

- **Blood pressure targets**: Maintain MAP ≥ 65 mmHg and SBP ≥ 90 mmHg to ensure adequate perfusion [^114Kiatt].

- **Vasoactive support**: Use norepinephrine or epinephrine for vasopressor support; consider inotropes for myocardial dysfunction.

- **Echocardiography**: Perform early echocardiography to assess cardiac function and guide therapy.

---

## Neurologic management and prognostication

Seizure management includes **continuous EEG monitoring** with **prompt antiepileptic treatment**. Prognostication should be delayed until **≥ 72 hours after rewarming or clearance of sedation** [^1174BziC] and should use a **multimodal assessment** (clinical exam, EEG, imaging, biomarkers).

---

## Identification and treatment of underlying causes

Coronary angiography should be performed **early** in patients with suspected myocardial ischemia or ongoing instability, with **revascularization when indicated** [^115wxj7z]. Other causes should also be evaluated and treated, including **reversible factors** such as electrolyte disturbances, hypoxia, and toxins [^113vEHMJ].

---

## Multidisciplinary care and rehabilitation

Multidisciplinary team involvement should occur **early**, engaging cardiology, neurology, critical care, and rehabilitation specialists. Rehabilitation should begin **early**, with **psychological support** for patients and families [^114pfsd9].

---

## Complications and outcomes

Complications commonly include **neurologic injury, myocardial dysfunction, infections, and metabolic disturbances** [^1179irgH]. Outcomes depend on the **initial rhythm**, **arrest duration**, and on the **quality of post-arrest care** [^114Kiatt].

---

Post-cardiac arrest care requires a structured, multidisciplinary approach focused on stabilization, temperature control, hemodynamic optimization, and early identification of underlying causes to **improve survival and neurologic outcomes** [^115RTjxQ].

### Post-cardiac arrest care [^114zDfCY]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2023). Low credibility.

A structured approach to post-cardiac arrest care is needed. Immediate goals include obtaining a blood pressure reading and an ECG immediately after the return of spontaneous circulation. More advanced goals involve minimizing CNS injury, managing cardiovascular dysfunction, reducing systemic ischemic/reperfusion injury, and identifying and treating the underlying cause of the arrest. This article summarizes the understanding of the hemodynamic, neurologic, and metabolic abnormalities encountered in post-arrest patients.

### Critical care management of patients after cardiac arrest: A scientific statement from the American Heart Association and Neurocritical Care Society [^117WRogc]. Neurocritical Care (2024). High credibility.

Cardiac arrest (CA) affects over 600,000 people annually in the United States, with a worldwide annual incidence of 30 to 97 individuals per 100,000 population. Intensive care management of CA survivors is crucial as it significantly influences survival and neurological outcomes. Although there has been improvement in the outcomes of patients with sudden CA, overall survival rates remain low, impacting the quality of life for survivors. In 2020, the overall survival to hospital discharge for adults resuscitated from out-of-hospital CA was 9%, whereas it was 23% for those with in-hospital CA.

Research and advancements in care have concentrated on the chain of survival measures to enhance CA resuscitation: these include the recognition of CA and activation of emergency response, early cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) with a focus on high-quality chest compressions, early defibrillation, basic and advanced life support, post-CA care, and recovery. There is a strong focus on early response with the objective of achieving a return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) as swiftly as possible. However, achieving ROSC is only the beginning of comprehensive, multisystem care for CA survivors. Upon achieving ROSC, the majority of CA survivors remain unresponsive, indicating significant brain injury. Unfortunately, the overall certainty of evidence supporting the benefit of many interventions post-ROSC is limited.

Guidelines offer few strong recommendations regarding post-CA care due to the scope of available literature and limited certainty of evidence. The process of drafting guidelines involves a structured framework to convert evidence into practice.

### Meta-analysis of the usefulness of therapeutic hypothermia after cardiac arrest [^115pq1w6]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2020). High credibility.

Despite guidelines recommending therapeutic hypothermia (TH) for post-cardiac arrest comatose patients, its use remains limited. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have also reported conflicting results on the efficacy of TH. Therefore, we conducted an updated meta-analysis to evaluate the effect of TH in post-cardiac arrest patients. We searched electronic databases for RCTs comparing TH (32°C to 34°C) with controls (normothermia or temperature ≥ 36°C) in comatose patients who sustained cardiac arrest. Mortality and neurological outcomes were the outcomes of interest. We used random effect meta-analysis to estimate risk ratio (RR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI). Eight RCTs with a total of 2,026 patients (TH n = 1,025 and control n = 1,001) were included. Irrespective of initial rhythm, TH was associated with a significant reduction in poor neurological outcomes (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.77 to 0.98; p = 0.02) without any difference in mortality (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.03; p = 0.17).

In patients with initial shockable rhythm compared with control, TH reduced mortality (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.99; p = 0.04) and poor neurological outcomes (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.99; p = 0.04). Whereas, in patients with initial nonshockable rhythm, TH was associated with decreased poor neurological outcomes after excluding one trial (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.00; p = 0.05). In conclusion, TH is associated with improved neurological outcomes in all patients sustaining cardiac arrest and with decreased mortality in patients with an initial shockable rhythm.

### Cardiac arrest in pigs with 48 hours of post-resuscitation care induced by 2 methods of myocardial infarction: A methodological description [^113C8DE1]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

Recent systematic reviews have shown that cardiac arrest animal research is lacking clinically relevant features and is often judged as having a high risk of bias. Clinical relevance in the setting of cardiac arrest concerns, among other aspects, the induction method of cardiac arrest, basic and advanced life support, as well as post-cardiac arrest care. The most prevalent cause of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest is myocardial infarction. Despite this, the most commonly used induction methods in cardiac arrest animal models are pacing-induced arrhythmias and asphyxia. In a review of 490 studies, myocardial infarction was used in only 2% of all studies. The same review found, related to post-resuscitation care, that only 13% used organ-supportive measures, 4% targeted temperature management (TTM), and for the large animal models, the median post-resuscitation observation time was merely 4 hours. Hence, there is an unmet need for clinically relevant large-animal cardiac arrest models to make sure that promising interventions are rigorously tested before translation into clinical studies.

There is a growing number of randomized clinical trials testing cardiac arrest interventions. Despite this, only a minority of pre-clinically tested pharmacological interventions actually advance to clinical testing, and experimental positive results often translate unsuccessfully. If the quality of results from preclinical studies could be improved, it could increase the likelihood of translation of positive results to clinical trials. Conducting high-quality, clinically relevant experimental animal research is crucial.

### ERC-ESICM guidelines on temperature control after cardiac arrest in adults [^113NN5P9]. Intensive Care Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for cardiac arrest, specifically in the context of post-resuscitation care and temperature control, the ERC/ESICM 2022 guidelines indicate that there is insufficient evidence to make specific recommendations for, or against maintaining a target temperature of 32–36 °C in subpopulations of patients with cardiac arrest or utilizing early cooling.

### Risk-standardizing rates of return of spontaneous circulation for in-hospital cardiac arrest to facilitate hospital comparisons [^115TXNZS]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

In-hospital cardiac arrest is common and is associated with a low overall survival rate of 20% to 25%. Hospital initiatives to improve outcomes have primarily focused on the acute resuscitation period, with an emphasis on minimizing interruptions and maximizing the quality of chest compressions, as well as ensuring the timely delivery of defibrillation and vasoactive medications. Companies, in turn, have introduced devices to better monitor the quality of cardiopulmonary resuscitation and deliver more consistent cardiopulmonary resuscitation.

- **Risk adjustment necessity**: Unlike process-of-care measures for resuscitation (e.g. timely defibrillation), which do not require risk adjustment as their performance should be independent of patient characteristics, survival outcomes require risk standardization to account for variations in patient case-mix across sites to facilitate a more unbiased comparison across hospitals. Although risk-standardized rates of survival to discharge exist for in-hospital cardiac arrest, they may not reflect the direct impact of quality improvement initiatives focused on the intra-arrest period, as overall survival is affected by both acute and post-resuscitation care.

- **Quality improvement interventions**: This is particularly critical for quality improvement interventions that focus on the delivery of higher-quality cardiopulmonary resuscitation, where the return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) is the most proximal patient outcome. Developing a validated model to risk-standardize hospital rates of acute resuscitation survival, defined as ROSC that is sustained for at least 20 consecutive minutes.

### Pre-arrest and intra-arrest prognostic factors associated with survival after in-hospital cardiac arrest: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^11726sqQ]. BMJ (2019). Low credibility.

Cardiac arrest refers to the cessation of mechanical heart function and effective blood circulation, typically categorized as either out-of-hospital cardiac arrest or in-hospital cardiac arrest. Although evidence from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest is often extrapolated to in-hospital cardiac arrest, the epidemiology is different, and the determinants of success might differ accordingly. In comparison to out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, data on incidence and survival after in-hospital cardiac arrest are limited. Most studies report an incidence of one to six events per 1000 hospital admissions. Survival to discharge ranges between 12% and 25%, with increased survival recently reported. One-year outcomes are similar, with only modest increases over the past decade.

Prognostic factors associated with survival after in-hospital cardiac arrest are an important focus of ongoing research. Patients admitted to the hospital have increasingly complex conditions and present unique challenges when managing in-hospital cardiac arrest. Clinicians must rapidly process many factors related to preadmission status, including age, sex, and comorbidities, and factors related to the arrest itself, such as whether the arrest was witnessed or monitored and the initial rhythm, to determine the effectiveness of ongoing cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Additionally, clinicians need to discuss the expected prognosis after in-hospital cardiac arrest with patients at the time of hospital admission to inform care plans and decide whether to include cardiopulmonary resuscitation in the event of cardiac arrest.

### Continuous neuromuscular blockade following successful resuscitation from cardiac arrest: A randomized trial [^116Cgnbk]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). High credibility.

In this trial, early, continuous neuromuscular blockade (NMB) compared with usual care following cardiac arrest was not associated with a decrease in serum lactate levels over the first 24 hours after trial enrollment. There was no between-group difference in any secondary clinical outcome.

### Clinical practice guidelines for sustained neuromuscular blockade in the adult critically ill patient [^1112o79X]. Critical Care Medicine (2016). High credibility.

The 2016 Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM) guidelines address follow-up and surveillance for cardiac arrest, particularly in the context of post-resuscitation care involving neuromuscular blockade. These guidelines indicate that there is insufficient evidence to recommend obtaining peripheral nerve stimulation to monitor the degree of blockade in patients undergoing therapeutic hypothermia.

### Door-to-targeted temperature management initiation after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: A new quality metric in postresuscitation care [^113r3fAF]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

The timing of hypothermia initiation after ROSC has been extensively evaluated. Although animal data suggested an incremental benefit with cooling initiated as early as within 15 minutes from ROSC, human observation studies have reported mixed results. Although some reports suggested that TTM administration in this setting was time-sensitive, others failed to identify such an association. The excitement about faster TTM initiation after ROSC was tempered by the negative results of seven randomized studies comparing prehospital cooling, either during arrest or shortly after, against standard hospital initiation of TTM. The interpretation of these trials was hampered by important design flaws, including small sample sizes, lack of blinding of outcomes assessment, absence of mandated rewarming protocols, and a significant proportion of patients who did not receive the intended treatment. In addition, concerns exist that the prehospital induction with large volumes of ice-cold solution, as the designated test intervention, might have adverse consequences that confounded the results. Consequently, whether earlier initiation with TTM provides incremental benefit in cardiac arrest survivors remains debatable.

### Risk-standardizing rates of return of spontaneous circulation for in-hospital cardiac arrest to facilitate hospital comparisons [^1144JXpH]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

Within a large national registry, we derived and validated a risk-adjustment model for hospital rates of sustained return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) after in-hospital cardiac arrest. The model was based on 10 clinical variables that are common in clinical care and easy to collect. Moreover, the model had good discrimination and excellent calibration. Importantly, our study adhered to recommended standards employed for public reporting by using hierarchical models and was based on a contemporary cohort of patients with in-hospital cardiac arrest. This risk-standardization methodology provides a mechanism to compare rates of ROSC across hospitals and assess the impact of hospital resuscitation initiatives on rates of ROSC.

The American Heart Association's Get With The Guidelines-Resuscitation national registry has developed several target benchmarks to highlight hospitals with exceptional performance. Most of these performance metrics relate to processes of care, such as time to defibrillation or epinephrine, and time to initiation of cardiopulmonary resuscitation, which should be independent of patient case mix. However, survival outcomes, such as ROSC after in-hospital cardiac arrest, may be heavily influenced by patient case mix, especially by variables such as age, initial cardiac arrest rhythm, and illness severity at the time of cardiac arrest. As a result, differences in unadjusted hospital rates of ROSC could simply be due to differences in patient case mix. At the time of writing, a risk-standardization model to facilitate comparisons of ROSC rates across hospitals does not exist.

### Clinical heterogeneity and phenotyping of post cardiac arrest brain injury: One size may not fit all [^115p1YhW]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

Post-cardiac arrest brain injury (PCABI) arises during and following resuscitation from cardiac arrest. Amongst survivors, it is the most common determinant of clinical outcome. PCABI is associated with high mortality and significant long-term neuropsychiatric sequelae, ranging from states of impaired consciousness to psychiatric illness encompassing depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, and anxiety. These long-term consequences are linked to a significant increase in healthcare costs and a burden for patients and their families. Recently, the incidence of PCABI has been increasing with aging populations worldwide and widespread increases in overdose-related cardiac arrest.

Small improvements in PCABI outcomes are attributed to on-scene interventions, such as immediate cardiopulmonary resuscitation and defibrillation. Regrettably, outcomes related to interventions in the intensive care setting have not appreciably improved, despite advancements in other major critical illnesses, such as sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome. This finding is likely attributed to a paucity of efficacious therapies and management strategies for PCABI. Recent PCABI clinical trials have yielded numerous neutral trial results, which could be due to underpowered studies and overly optimistic effect sizes. However, it is possible that between-patient heterogeneity of PCABI has also been underappreciated.

A central theme in the provision of healthcare in critical care is providing consistent medical interventions to all patients; however, it is increasingly recognized that this approach may not be suitable for managing PCABI.

### Impact of therapeutic hypothermia onset and duration on survival, neurologic function, and neurodegeneration after cardiac arrest [^116ntZE8]. Critical Care Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Post-cardiac-arrest therapeutic hypothermia improves outcomes in comatose cardiac arrest survivors. This study tests the hypothesis that the efficacy of post-cardiac-arrest therapeutic hypothermia is dependent on the onset and duration of therapy.

- **Design**: Prospective randomized laboratory investigation.

- **Setting**: University research laboratory.

- **Subjects**: A total of 268 male Long Evans rats.

- **Interventions**: Post-cardiac-arrest therapeutic hypothermia.

- **Measurements and main results**: Adult male Long Evans rats that achieved return of spontaneous circulation following a 10-minute asphyxial cardiac arrest were block randomized to normothermia (37°C ± 1°C) or therapeutic hypothermia (33°C ± 1°C) initiated 0, 1, 4, or 8 hours after return of spontaneous circulation and maintained for 24 or 48 hours. Therapeutic hypothermia initiated 0, 1, 4, and 8 hours after return of spontaneous circulation resulted in 7-day survival rates of 45%*, 36%*, 36%*, and 14%, respectively, compared to 17% for normothermic controls and survival with good neurologic function rates of 24%*, 24%*, 19%*, and 0%, respectively, compared to 2% for normothermic controls (✱ p < .05 vs. normothermia). These outcomes were not significantly different when therapeutic hypothermia was maintained for 24 versus 48 hours. In contrast, hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neuron counts were 53% ± 27%*, 53% ± 19%*, 51% ± 24%*, and 65% ± 16%* of normal, respectively, when therapeutic hypothermia was initiated 0, 1, 4, or 8 hours after return of spontaneous circulation compared to 9% in normothermic controls (✱ p < .01 vs. normothermia).

### The immunology of the post-cardiac arrest syndrome [^113WtdwJ]. Resuscitation (2022). Low credibility.

Patients successfully resuscitated from cardiac arrest often experience brain injury, myocardial dysfunction, and systemic ischemia-reperfusion injury, collectively termed the post-cardiac arrest syndrome (PCAS). To improve outcomes, potential therapies must be administered early in the post-arrest course and provide broad cytoprotection, as ischemia-reperfusion injury affects all organ systems. Our understanding of the immune system's contributions to PCAS has expanded, with animal models detailing biologically plausible mechanisms of secondary injury, the protective effects of available immunomodulatory drugs, and how immune dysregulation underlies infection susceptibility after arrest.

In this narrative review, we discuss the dysregulated immune response in PCAS, human trials of targeted immunomodulation therapies, and future directions for immunomodulation following cardiac arrest.

### 2022 ESC guidelines for the management of patients with ventricular arrhythmias and the prevention of sudden cardiac death [^111aExtT]. European Heart Journal (2022). High credibility.

Regarding the follow-up and surveillance for cardiac arrest, specifically in the context of post-resuscitation evaluation for extra-cardiac causes, the ESC 2022 guidelines recommend considering the use of brain and chest CT scans in sudden cardiac arrest survivors when patient characteristics, ECG, and echocardiography do not consistently point to a cardiac cause.

### Post-resuscitation care in the NICU [^1169xna1]. Seminars in Perinatology (2024). Low credibility.

Post-cardiac arrest syndrome is a unique pathophysiologic condition that is well described in adult and pediatric populations. Early, goal-directed care after cardiac arrest can mitigate ongoing injury, improve clinical outcomes, and prevent re-arrest. There is a paucity of evidence about post-cardiac arrest care in the NICU; however, pediatric principles and guidelines can be applied in the NICU in the appropriate clinical context.

### Outcome measures utilized in clinical trials of interventions for post-cardiac arrest syndrome: a systematic review [^111QZMxt]. Resuscitation (2009). Low credibility.

The post-cardiac arrest syndrome, which is the period of critical illness following the return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), represents a promising window of opportunity for clinical trials of therapeutic interventions aimed at improving outcomes from cardiac arrest. However, the methodological rigor of post-ROSC trials and the ability to compare or pool data on treatment effects across studies requires consistent and appropriate outcome measures. We aimed to determine the degree of uniformity of outcome measures in clinical trials of post-ROSC interventions.

- **Methods**: We conducted a systematic review of the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, conference proceedings, and clinical trial registrations using a comprehensive strategy. We identified experimental or quasi-experimental trials testing post-ROSC interventions in adults. Four authors independently extracted data and assessed study quality using standardized instruments.

- **Results**: The search yielded 33 potential studies, of which 13 randomized controlled trials (n = 1937) were included in the final analysis. Seven trials tested pharmacologic therapies and six tested non-pharmacologic therapies. Our main finding is that heterogeneity in the selection and reporting of outcomes limited comparability of results across studies. No two trials used exactly the same primary outcome, and the timing of measurement varied widely. We found only two commonalities: (1) indices of functional survival were used rather than survival alone, and (2) ordinal scales of neurological function were collapsed into clinically meaningful groups, such as "good".

### Methods of the 7 national audit project (NAP7) of the Royal College of Anaesthetists: Peri-operative cardiac arrest [^116FtuWu]. Anaesthesia (2022). Low credibility.

The review panel refers to published guidelines as indications for best practices, including, but not limited to, those from the Resuscitation Council (UK) and European Resuscitation Council for adult and paediatric advanced life support, Association of Anaesthetists Quick Reference Handbook, and specialist society guidelines (e.g. cardiac advanced life support), and guidance covering treatment escalation plans and end‐of‐life care (e.g. ReSPECT). The panel judged the overall quality of care as 'good', 'poor', 'good and poor' or 'unclear' based on guidelines, the specific circumstances of the case, and ultimately by panel consensus.

Previous NAPs have reviewed approximately 200 cases. In NAP7, up to 1000 cases may be reported. Once the review process is established, a complimentary rapid review process will be used to allow learning from all cases to be incorporated into the final report. Rapid review cases will be assessed by two panel members independently. Where the case requires subspecialty expertise, one reviewer will be from the relevant stakeholder group. The review outcome will focus on the quality of care and learning points. If either panel member records that the case should be reviewed by the full panel or there is notable disagreement between panel members in their assessment, the case will be submitted for full panel review.

### Critical care management of patients after cardiac arrest: A scientific statement from the American Heart Association and Neurocritical Care Society [^117EBZMn]. Neurocritical Care (2024). High credibility.

Although post-cardiac arrest (CA) myocardial dysfunction is common, it is not correlated with survival or neurological outcome, indicating that patients can still have good outcomes with aggressive critical care management of their cardiac disease. The critical care management of patients with post-CA cardiac dysfunction lacks high-certainty evidence-based guidance. Here, we address important topics such as the use of echocardiography to guide hemodynamic resuscitation after CA, the emerging field of mechanical circulatory support after CA, and the determination of which patients without ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction may be considered for catheterization.

- **Hemodynamics, monitoring, and mechanical circulatory support**: As discussed in the section, "Neurological Management in the Intensive Care Unit: Brain Oxygenation, Perfusion, Edema, and ICP", the optimal blood pressure target to improve CA outcomes and how to achieve said targets have been of research interest over the past decade. Recent studies have focused on the association between blood pressure and neurological function, specifically evaluating surrogates of brain perfusion and oxygenation under the premise that using physiological data points that assess cerebral oxygen delivery and perfusion may help guide blood pressure thresholds and improve neurological outcomes. Individual patient characteristics, including the degree of myocardial dysfunction, underlying cause of shock, baseline pre-arrest blood pressure, and concomitant brain injury, are evaluated when post-CA mean arterial pressure (MAP) targets are set.

### Improving outcomes after post-cardiac arrest brain injury: A scientific statement from the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation [^1134uD8L]. Resuscitation (2024). Low credibility.

This scientific statement presents a conceptual framework for the pathophysiology of post-cardiac arrest brain injury, explores reasons for previous failures to translate preclinical data to clinical practice, and outlines potential paths forward. Post-cardiac arrest brain injury is characterized by four distinct but overlapping phases: ischemic depolarization, reperfusion repolarization, dysregulation, and recovery and repair.

Previous research has been challenging due to the limitations of laboratory models, heterogeneity in patient populations enrolled, overoptimistic estimation of treatment effects leading to suboptimal sample sizes, timing and route of intervention delivery, limited or absent evidence that the intervention has engaged the mechanistic target, and heterogeneity in postresuscitation care, prognostication, and withdrawal of life-sustaining treatments. Future trials must tailor their interventions to the subset of patients most likely to benefit and deliver this intervention at the appropriate time, through the appropriate route, and at the appropriate dose.

The complexity of post-cardiac arrest brain injury suggests that monotherapies are unlikely to be as successful as multimodal neuroprotective therapies. Biomarkers should be developed to identify patients with the targeted mechanism of injury, to quantify its severity, and to measure the response to therapy. Studies need to be adequately powered to detect effect sizes that are realistic and meaningful to patients, their families, and clinicians. Study designs should be optimized to accelerate the evaluation of such interventions.

### Post-resuscitation care following out-of-hospital and in-hospital cardiac arrest [^115wZ6Ut]. Heart (2015). Low credibility.

Cardiac arrest is a leading cause of death in developed countries. Although the majority of cardiac arrest patients die during the acute event, a substantial proportion of deaths occur in patients following successful resuscitation due to the development of post-cardiac arrest syndrome. There is growing recognition that integrated post-resuscitation care, encompassing targeted temperature management (TTM), early coronary angiography, and comprehensive critical care, can improve patient outcomes.

TTM has been shown to improve survival and neurological outcomes in patients who remain comatose, especially following out-of-hospital cardiac arrest due to ventricular arrhythmias. Early coronary angiography and revascularisation, if needed, may also be beneficial during the post-resuscitation phase, based on data from observational studies. In addition, resuscitated patients usually require intensive care, which includes mechanical ventilator support, haemodynamic support, and close monitoring of blood gases, glucose, electrolytes, seizures, and other disease-specific interventions.

Efforts should be made to avoid premature withdrawal of life-supporting treatment, especially in patients treated with TTM. Given that not all hospitals have the resources and personnel needed to provide high-quality post-resuscitation care, professional societies have recommended the regionalisation of such care in specialised 'cardiac arrest centres' as a strategy to improve outcomes.

### Safely completed therapeutic hypothermia in postpartum cardiac arrest survivors [^1142Wt9b]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Recently, therapeutic hypothermia (TH) has been used as one of the most important treatments for post–cardiac arrest care. Although TH induces several complications, it is performed across various medical fields. This series of case studies describes two cases of postpartum cardiac arrest treated with TH without serious complications. One patient exhibited coagulopathy and bleeding tendencies; however, this report suggests further application for TH. Therefore, emergency physicians should consider TH for the treatment of postpartum cardiac arrest.

### Targeted temperature management in postresuscitation care after incorporating results of the TTM2 trial [^1138yu45]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). High credibility.

Cardiac arrest remains a significant cause of cardiovascular-related deaths and is associated with a high risk of neurological injury and poor quality of life among survivors. Critical factors influencing survival and long-term functional status after cardiac arrest include the timely initiation of cardiopulmonary resuscitation and the use of an external defibrillator for patients with a shockable rhythm. Despite continuous efforts to enhance cardiac arrest response systems and develop comprehensive postresuscitation algorithms, outcomes remain unsatisfactory.

Targeted temperature management, ranging from 32 °C to 36 °C, has been a key therapeutic strategy to improve neurological outcomes in postresuscitation care. This recommendation was primarily based on two small randomized trials conducted 20 years ago. However, recent findings from the TTM2 (Targeted Hypothermia Versus Targeted Normothermia After Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest) trial, which included 1,861 patients, challenge this approach. The trial demonstrated no advantage of targeted hypothermia at 33 °C over normothermia at 36 °C to 37.5 °C with fever prevention. Given that lower temperature management also correlated with an increased risk of side effects without any added benefit in the TTM2 trial, it may be necessary to modify guidelines to harmonize temperature management towards normothermia.

### Clinical practice guidelines for sustained neuromuscular blockade in the adult critically ill patient [^116jhZ6p]. Critical Care Medicine (2016). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for cardiac arrest, specifically concerning post-resuscitation care (neuromuscular blockade), SCCM 2016 guidelines recommend obtaining peripheral nerve stimulation in conjunction with an assessment of other clinical findings, such as triggering of the ventilator and degree of shivering. This helps assess the degree of neuromuscular blockade in patients undergoing therapeutic hypothermia.

### Clinical heterogeneity and phenotyping of post cardiac arrest brain injury: One size may not fit all [^111Zedqd]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

Post-cardiac arrest brain injury (PCABI) emanates from the injurious pathophysiologic sequelae that occur during and after resuscitation from cardiac arrest. Regrettably, the identification of efficacious management strategies to mitigate PCABI has been disappointing, with numerous well-conducted randomized control trials yielding neutral results. The reasons for this observation are likely multifactorial. However, increasingly, patient and disease-specific heterogeneity is recognized as a crucial factor in clinical decision-making. Traditionally, PCABI has been stratified based on simple historical characteristics (e.g. location of cardiac arrest, initial rhythm, witnessed vs. unwitnessed) that inadequately reflect in vivo PCABI severity or responses to clinical interventions within individual patients. It is therefore increasingly clear that this approach to PCABI is insufficient.

In other syndromes, such as sepsis or acute respiratory distress syndrome, attempts to identify early "phenotypes" of patients reflect growing recognition of considerable between-patient heterogeneity in the disease mechanisms and response to therapeutic interventions. A similar approach should be taken with PCABI. In this review, we described the clinical heterogeneity and phenotypes of PCABI as related to the underlying pathophysiology, selective anatomical vulnerability, and electrographic patterns. The overarching aim of the review is to propose a shift to expeditious phenotyping of PCABI severity that focuses on assessing in vivo severity and patterns of injury that could be used for future clinical applications.

### Risk-standardizing survival for in-hospital cardiac arrest to facilitate hospital comparisons [^114oszkM]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2013). High credibility.

The purpose of this study is to develop a method for risk-standardizing hospital survival after cardiac arrest. A foundation with which hospitals can improve quality is to be able to benchmark their risk-adjusted performance against other hospitals, something that cannot currently be done for survival after in-hospital cardiac arrest.

Within the Get With the Guidelines (GWTG)-Resuscitation registry, we identified 48,841 patients admitted between 2007 and 2010 with an in-hospital cardiac arrest. Using hierarchical logistic regression, we derived and validated a model for survival to hospital discharge and calculated risk-standardized survival rates (RSSRs) for 272 hospitals with at least 10 cardiac arrest cases.

The survival rate was 21.0% and 21.2% for the derivation and validation cohorts, respectively. The model had good discrimination (C-statistic 0.74) and excellent calibration. Eighteen variables were associated with survival to discharge, and a parsimonious model contained 9 variables with minimal change in model discrimination. Before risk adjustment, the median hospital survival rate was 20% (interquartile range: 14% to 26%), with a wide range (0% to 85%). After adjustment, the distribution of RSSRs was substantially narrower: median of 21% (interquartile range: 19% to 23%; range 11% to 35%). More than half (143 [52.6%]) of hospitals had at least a 10% positive or negative absolute change in percentile rank after risk standardization, and 50 (23.2%) had a ≥ 20% absolute change in percentile rank.

### Brain injury after cardiac arrest: Pathophysiology, treatment, and prognosis [^116cjR81]. Intensive Care Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Post-cardiac arrest brain injury (PCABI) is caused by initial ischaemia and subsequent reperfusion of the brain following resuscitation. In those admitted to the intensive care unit after cardiac arrest, PCABI manifests as coma and is the main cause of mortality and long-term disability. This review describes the mechanisms of PCABI, its treatment options, outcomes, and the suggested strategies for outcome prediction.

### Association between duration of resuscitation and favorable outcome after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: Implications for prolonging or terminating resuscitation [^11145arS]. Circulation (2016). Low credibility.

Little evidence guides the appropriate duration of resuscitation in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, and case features justifying longer or shorter durations are ill-defined. We estimated the impact of resuscitation duration on the probability of a favorable functional outcome in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest using a large, multicenter cohort.

- **Methods**: This was a secondary analysis of a North American, single-blind, multicenter, cluster-randomized clinical trial (ROC-PRIMED [Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium Prehospital Resuscitation Using an Impedance Valve and Early Versus Delayed]). It included consecutive adults with nontraumatic, emergency medical services-treated out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. The primary exposure was the duration of resuscitation in minutes (from the onset of professional resuscitation to return of spontaneous circulation [ROSC] or termination of resuscitation). The primary outcome was survival to hospital discharge with a favorable outcome (modified Rankin scale [mRS] score of 0–3). Subjects were additionally classified as survival with unfavorable outcome (mRS score of 4–5), ROSC without survival (mRS score of 6), or without ROSC. Subject accrual was plotted as a function of resuscitation duration, and the dynamic probability of a favorable outcome at discharge was estimated for the whole cohort and subgroups. Adjusted logistic regression models tested the association between resuscitation duration and survival with a favorable outcome.

- **Results**: The primary cohort included 11,368 subjects (median age, 69 years [interquartile range, 56–81 years]; 7,121 men [62.6%]). Of these…

### Door-to-targeted temperature management initiation after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: A new quality metric in postresuscitation care [^116otdcW]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). High credibility.

The administration of targeted temperature management (TTM) is considered standard of care in the treatment of comatose cardiac arrest survivors, particularly those with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest arising from a shockable rhythm. Despite the lack of high-quality evidence, resuscitation guidelines encourage that TTM also be considered for unresponsive survivors of in-hospital cardiac arrest or cardiac arrest stemming from a nonshockable rhythm, as the intervention appears to provide a net overall benefit.

Despite advances in postresuscitative care and routine use of TTM, the prognosis of comatose arrest survivors continues to be dismal. The dominant mechanism of death following a cardiac arrest is related to brain injury arising from the combination of ischemia during the arrest and ensuing ischemia-reperfusion injury on return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). The remaining deaths after an arrest are a consequence of circulatory collapse in the setting of shock, resulting from initial cardiac dysfunction accompanied by profound vasodilation and multiorgan failure.

The observed benefits of TTM in cardiac arrest are mainly attributed to the reduction of brain metabolism and attenuation of the ischemia-reperfusion cascade, with some proposing an adjunctive cardioprotective effect. Although a class I recommendation, the optimal TTM prescription for unresponsive arrest survivors remains largely unknown, and practice predominantly mirrors landmark trial proceedings with minor adaptations.

### Management of the post-cardiac arrest syndrome [^114GYijj]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Recent advances in resuscitation science have revolutionized the care of cardiac arrest patients. Dramatic departures from time-honored advanced cardiac life support therapies, such as cardiocerebral resuscitation and bundled post-arrest care, have given rise to a new paradigm of resuscitation practices, which has boosted the rate of neurologically intact survival.

- **Objectives**: This article reviews the pathophysiology of the post-cardiac arrest syndrome, the collective pathophysiology after the return of spontaneous circulation, and presents management pearls specifically for the emergency physician. This growing area of scientific inquiry must be managed appropriately to sustain improved outcomes.

- **Discussion**: The emergency physician must understand this pathophysiology, manage resuscitated patients according to the latest evidence, and coordinate with appropriate inpatient resources.

- **Conclusion**: The new approach to cardiac arrest care is predicated on a chain of survival that spans the spectrum of care from the prehospital arena through the emergency, intensive, and inpatient settings. The emergency physician is a crucial link in this chain.

### Association between a hospital's quality performance for in-hospital cardiac arrest and common medical conditions [^115yMD2a]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2013). Low credibility.

Public reporting on hospital quality has been widely adopted for common medical conditions, and adding a measure of inpatient survival after cardiac arrest is being considered. It is unknown whether this measure would be redundant, given evidence that hospital organization and culture can have hospital-wide effects on quality. Therefore, we sought to evaluate the correlation between inpatient survival after cardiac arrest and 30-day risk-standardized mortality rates for common medical conditions.

- **Methods and results**: Using data between 2007 and 2010 from a national in-hospital cardiac arrest registry, we calculated risk-standardized in-hospital survival rates for cardiac arrest at each hospital. We obtained risk-standardized 30-day mortality rates for acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, and pneumonia from Hospital Compare for the same period. The relationship between a hospital's performance on cardiac arrest and these other medical conditions was assessed using weighted Pearson correlation coefficients. Among 26,270 patients with in-hospital cardiac arrest at 130 hospitals, survival rates varied across hospitals, with a median risk-standardized hospital survival rate of 22.1% and an interquartile range of 19.7% to 24.2%. There were no significant correlations between a hospital's outcomes for its cardiac arrest patients and its patients admitted for acute myocardial infarction (correlation, -0.12; P = 0.16), heart failure (correlation, -0.05; P = 0.57), or pneumonia (correlation, -0.15; P = 0.10).

- **Conclusions**: Hospitals that performed better on publicly reported metrics do not necessarily perform better in in-hospital cardiac arrest survival.

### Expedited transfer to a cardiac arrest centre for non-ST-elevation out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (ARREST): A UK prospective, multicentre, parallel, randomised clinical trial [^116CGoGa]. Lancet (2023). High credibility.

Three participants in the cardiac arrest centre group and one in the standard care group did not have known mortality status at 30 days because they were discharged between days 11 and 21 without follow-up; therefore, primary outcome data were available in 411 (95%) of 431 participants in the cardiac arrest centre group and 412 (96%) of 431 participants in the standard care group (Table 3).

- **30-day all-cause mortality**: 258 (63%) of 411 in the cardiac arrest centre group and 258 (63%) of 412 in the standard care group (unadjusted RR for survival 1.00 [95% CI 0.90 to 1.11], p = 0.96; risk difference 0.2% [95% CI –6.5 to 6.8]).

- **3-month all-cause mortality**: There was no difference between the two groups (RR 1.02 [95% CI 0.92 to 1.12]; risk difference 1.0% [95% CI –5.6 to 7.5]).

The Kaplan-Meier plot for all-cause mortality at 3 months is provided in Figure 2.

### Sudden cardiac arrest survivorship: A scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^114pfsd9]. Circulation (2020). Low credibility.

Cardiac arrest systems of care are successfully coordinating community, emergency medical services, and hospital efforts to improve the process of care for patients who have had a cardiac arrest. As a result, the number of people surviving sudden cardiac arrest is increasing. However, physical, cognitive, and emotional effects of surviving cardiac arrest may linger for months or years. Systematic recommendations stop short of addressing partnerships needed to care for patients and caregivers after medical stabilization. This document expands the cardiac arrest resuscitation system of care to include patients, caregivers, and rehabilitative healthcare partnerships, which are central to cardiac arrest survivorship.

### Temperature control after cardiac arrest [^114316K5]. Resuscitation (2023). High credibility.

Managing temperature is an important part of post-cardiac arrest care. Fever or hyperthermia during the first few days after cardiac arrest is associated with worse outcomes in many studies. Clinical data have not determined any target temperature or duration of temperature management that clearly improves patient outcomes. Guidelines and recent reviews recommend controlling temperature to prevent hyperthermia. Higher temperatures can lead to secondary brain injury by increasing seizures, brain edema, and metabolic demand. Some data suggest that targeting a temperature below normal could benefit select patients where this pathology is common.

Clinical temperature management should address the physiology of heat balance. Core temperature reflects the heat content of the head and torso, and changes in core temperature result from changes in the balance of heat production and heat loss. Clinical management of patients after cardiac arrest should include measurement of core temperature at accurate sites and monitoring signs of heat production, including shivering. Multiple methods can increase or decrease heat loss, including external and internal devices. Heat loss can trigger compensatory reflexes that increase stress and metabolic demand. Therefore, any active temperature management should include specific pharmacotherapy or other interventions to control thermogenesis, especially shivering. More research is required to determine whether individualized temperature management can improve outcomes.

### Pediatric post-cardiac arrest care: A scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^112576vY]. Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Successful resuscitation from cardiac arrest results in a post-cardiac arrest syndrome, which can evolve in the days to weeks after the return of sustained circulation. The components of post-cardiac arrest syndrome are brain injury, myocardial dysfunction, systemic ischemia/reperfusion response, and persistent precipitating pathophysiology. Pediatric post-cardiac arrest care focuses on anticipating, identifying, and treating this complex physiology to improve survival and neurological outcomes.

This scientific statement on post-cardiac arrest care is the result of a consensus process that included pediatric and adult emergency medicine, critical care, cardiac critical care, cardiology, neurology, and nursing specialists who analyzed the past 20 years of pediatric cardiac arrest, adult cardiac arrest, and pediatric critical illness peer-reviewed published literature. The statement summarizes the epidemiology, pathophysiology, management, and prognostication after the return of sustained circulation following cardiac arrest and provides consensus on the evidence supporting elements of pediatric post-cardiac arrest care.

### Pre-arrest predictors of survival after resuscitation from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in the elderly: A systematic review [^116MkyGL]. BMC Geriatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), developed in the 1950s, is a treatment for cardiac arrest, a potentially lethal condition. Unfortunately, the success rates for CPR are poor. The percentage of patients who leave the hospital alive following the procedure varies from 0% to 20% and has not significantly improved in the last 30 years. This might be caused by the increasing age of the population, longer EMS response time intervals attributable to urbanization and population growth, and the declining incidence of ventricular fibrillation arrests.

With increasing age, the prevalence of morbidity and disability clearly increases, while perceived health status and physical well-being decrease. The question arises whether CPR is appropriate for elderly patients who are multiply impaired and have limited life expectancy, given their reduced likelihood of survival with a reasonable quality of life.

Many studies and reviews have reported on the chances of success. Sasson et al. studied the survival of out-of-hospital cardiopulmonary resuscitation and found that the success rate depends on arrest factors, such as witnessed arrest, provision of bystander CPR, shockable cardiac rhythm, time to arrival of ambulance, and recovery of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) before hospital admission. However, all or most of these factors are unknown when the decision about CPR is made. A recent meta-analysis by Ebell et al. identified several pre-arrest predictors of failure to survive cardiopulmonary resuscitation for the in-hospital setting, although these factors remain incompletely understood.

### Postresuscitation care after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: Clinical update and focus on targeted temperature management [^1138tpd3]. Anesthesiology (2019). Low credibility.

Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest is a major cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide. With the introduction of targeted temperature management more than a decade ago, postresuscitation care has attracted increased attention. In this review, we discuss best practice hospital management of unconscious out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients with a special focus on targeted temperature management.

What is termed post-cardiac arrest syndrome affects all organs and mandates access to specialized intensive care. All patients require a secured airway, and most need hemodynamic support with fluids and/or vasopressors. Immediate coronary angiography and percutaneous coronary intervention, when indicated, have become essential parts of postresuscitation treatment.

Targeted temperature management with controlled sedation and mechanical ventilation is the most important neuroprotective strategy. It should be initiated as quickly as possible, and according to international guidelines, maintained at 32° to 36°C for at least 24 hours, with rewarming not exceeding 0.5°C per hour. However, uncertainty remains regarding components of targeted temperature management, warranting further research into the optimal cooling rate, target temperature, duration of cooling, and rewarming rate.

Moreover, targeted temperature management is associated with some adverse effects. The risk of infection and bleeding is moderately increased, as is the risk of hypokalemia and magnesemia. Continuous circulation monitoring is necessary.

### Critical care management of patients after cardiac arrest: A scientific statement from the American Heart Association and Neurocritical Care Society [^115RTjxQ]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Cardiac arrest (CA) affects over 600,000 people in the United States annually, with a worldwide incidence ranging from 30 to 97 individuals per 100,000 population. Intensive care management of CA survivors is crucial and influences survival and neurological outcomes. Although there have been improvements in the outcomes of patients with sudden CA, overall survival remains low, and the quality of life for survivors is affected. In 2020, overall survival to hospital discharge for adults resuscitated from out-of-hospital CA was 9%, while for those with in-hospital CA, it was 23%.

Research and advancements in care have focused on the chain of survival measures to improve CA resuscitation: recognition of CA and activation of emergency response, early cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) with an emphasis on high-quality chest compressions, early defibrillation, basic and advanced life support, post-CA care, and recovery. The emphasis has been on early response with the goal of achieving the return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) as soon as possible. Achieving ROSC is just the beginning of comprehensive, multisystem care for survivors of CA. Upon achieving ROSC, the majority of CA survivors remain unresponsive, indicating significant brain injury. Unfortunately, the overall certainty of evidence for the benefit of many interventions post-ROSC is limited.

Guidelines provide few strong recommendations about post-CA care due to the limited certainty of evidence and the scope of available literature. The guidelines writing process consists of a structured framework to transform evidence into clinical practice recommendations.

This focused review explores strategies for mitigating the effects of PCAS after the return of spontaneous circulation. We examine the evidence for controlled oxygenation, strategies for blood-pressure targets, the timing of coronary reperfusion, and the efficacy of temperature control and seizure treatment. Despite several large trials investigating specific strategies to improve outcomes post-cardiac arrest, many questions remain unanswered. Some study results suggest interventions may benefit specific subgroups of cardiac arrest patients; however, the optimal timing and duration of many interventions remain unknown. The role of intracranial pressure monitoring has been minimally studied, and its benefits remain unclear. Research aimed at improving the management of PCAS is ongoing.

### Clinical heterogeneity and phenotyping of post cardiac arrest brain injury: One size may not fit all [^114YbexH]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

Post-cardiac arrest brain injury (PCABI) emanates from the injurious pathophysiologic sequelae that take place during and after resuscitation from cardiac arrest. Regrettably, identification of efficacious management strategies to mitigate PCABI has been disappointing, with numerous well-conducted randomized control trials yielding neutral results. The reasons for this observation are likely multifactorial. However, increasingly, patient and disease-specific heterogeneity is recognized as a crucial factor in clinical decision-making.

Traditionally, PCABI has been stratified based upon simple historical characteristics, such as the location of cardiac arrest, initial rhythm, and whether it was witnessed or unwitnessed. These methods inadequately reflect in vivo PCABI severity or responses to clinical interventions within individual patients. It is, therefore, increasingly clear that this approach to PCABI is insufficient.

In other syndromes, such as sepsis or acute respiratory distress syndrome, attempts to identify early "phenotypes" of patients reflect growing recognition of considerable between-patient heterogeneity in the disease mechanisms and response to therapeutic interventions. A similar approach should be taken with PCABI. In this review, we describe the clinical heterogeneity and phenotypes of PCABI as related to the underlying pathophysiology, selective anatomical vulnerability, and electrographic patterns. The overarching aim of the review is to propose a shift to expeditious phenotyping of PCABI severity that focuses on assessing in vivo severity and patterns of injury that could be used for future research.

### Target temperature management after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest — a randomized, parallel-group, assessor-blinded clinical trial — rationale and design [^1125dWdg]. American Heart Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Experimental animal studies and previous randomized trials suggest an improvement in mortality and neurologic function with induced hypothermia after cardiac arrest. International guidelines advocate the use of a target temperature management of 32°C to 34°C for 12 to 24 hours after resuscitation from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. A systematic review indicates that the evidence for recommending this intervention is inconclusive, and the GRADE level of evidence is low. Previous trials were small with a high risk of bias, evaluated select populations, and did not treat hyperthermia in the control groups. The optimal target temperature management strategy is not known.

- **Methods**: The TTM trial is an investigator-initiated, international, randomized, parallel-group, and assessor-blinded clinical trial designed to enroll at least 850 adult, unconscious patients resuscitated after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest of a presumed cardiac cause. Patients will be randomized to a target temperature management of either 33°C or 36°C after return of spontaneous circulation. In both groups, the intervention will last 36 hours. The primary outcome is all-cause mortality at maximal follow-up. The main secondary outcomes are the composite outcome of all-cause mortality and poor neurologic function (cerebral performance categories 3 and 4) at hospital discharge and at 180 days, cognitive status and quality of life at 180 days, and assessment of safety and harm.

- **Discussion**: The TTM trial will investigate the potential benefit and harm of two target temperature strategies, both avoiding hyperthermia's potential effects.

### ERC-ESICM guidelines on temperature control after cardiac arrest in adults [^112Aejuc]. Intensive Care Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for cardiac arrest, more specifically with respect to post-resuscitation care and temperature control, the ERC/ESICM 2022 guidelines recommend obtaining continuous monitoring of core temperature in patients remaining comatose after the return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) from cardiac arrest.

### Prognosis of cardiac arrest-peri-arrest and post-arrest considerations [^1174BziC]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2023). Low credibility.

There has been only a small improvement in survival and neurologic outcomes in patients with cardiac arrest in recent decades. The type of arrest, length of total arrest time, and location of arrest alter the trajectory of survival and neurologic outcome.

In the post-arrest phase, clinical markers such as blood markers, pupillary light response, corneal reflex, myoclonic jerking, somatosensory evoked potential, and electroencephalography testing can be used to help guide neurological prognostication. Most of the testing should be performed 72 hours post-arrest, with special considerations for longer observation periods in patients who underwent TTM or who had prolonged sedation and/or neuromuscular blockade.

### Post-cardiac arrest physiology and management in the neonatal intensive care unit [^111UhiFH]. Resuscitation (2021). Low credibility.

The importance of high-quality post-cardiac arrest care is well-described in adult and pediatric populations, but data are lacking to inform post-cardiac arrest care in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). The objective of this study was to describe post-cardiac arrest physiology and management in a quaternary NICU.

- **Methods**: Retrospective descriptive study of post-cardiac arrest physiology and management. Data were abstracted from electronic medical records and an institutional resuscitation database. A cardiac arrest was defined as ≥ 1 minute of chest compressions. Only index arrests were analyzed. Descriptive statistics were used to report patient, intra-arrest, and post-arrest characteristics.

- **Results**: There were 110 index cardiac arrests during the 5-year study period from 1/2017–2/2021. The majority (69%) were acute respiratory compromise leading to cardiopulmonary arrest (ARC-CPA), and 26% were primary cardiopulmonary arrests (CPA). Vital sign monitoring within 24 hours post-arrest was variable, especially non-invasive blood pressure frequency (median 5, range 1–44 measurements). There was a high prevalence of hypothermia (73% of arrest survivors). There was substantial variability in laboratory frequency within 24 hours post-arrest. Patients with primary CPA received significantly more lab testing and had a higher prevalence of acidosis (pH < 7.2) than those with ARC-CPA.

- **Conclusions**: We identified significant variation in post-arrest management and a high prevalence of hypothermia. These data highlight the need for post-arrest management guidelines specific to the NICU setting.

### Post-cardiac arrest brain injury: Pathophysiology and treatment [^112ixQNf]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2012). Low credibility.

Cardiac arrest is a leading cause of death that affects more than a million individuals worldwide every year. Despite recent advancements in the field of cardiac arrest and resuscitation, the management and prognosis of post-cardiac arrest brain injury remain suboptimal. The pathophysiology of post-cardiac arrest brain injury involves a complex cascade of molecular events, most of which remain unknown. Considering that a potentially broad therapeutic window for neuroprotective drug therapy is offered in most successfully resuscitated patients after cardiac arrest, further research is imperative. The aim of this article is to present the major pathophysiological disturbances leading to post-cardiac arrest brain injury, as well as to review the available pharmacological therapies.

### Postcardiac arrest management [^113ZsNX3]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Cardiac arrest afflicts more than 300,000 persons annually in North America alone. Advances in systematic, regimented post-resuscitation care have lowered mortality and improved neurologic outcomes in select cohorts of patients over the last decade. Postcardiac arrest care now comprises its own link in the chain of survival. For most patients, high-quality postcardiac arrest care begins in the emergency department. This article reviews the evidence and offers treatment strategies for the key components of postcardiac arrest care.

### Improving survival from cardiac arrest: A review of contemporary practice and challenges [^1156sjiX]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Cardiac arrest is a common and lethal condition frequently encountered by emergency medicine providers. Resuscitation of persons after cardiac arrest remains challenging, and outcomes remain poor overall. Successful resuscitation hinges on timely, high-quality cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The optimal method of providing chest compressions and ventilator support during cardiac arrest remains uncertain. Prompt and effective defibrillation of ventricular arrhythmias is one of the few effective therapies available for the treatment of cardiac arrest.

Despite numerous studies over several decades, no specific drug delivered during cardiac arrest has been shown to improve neurologically intact survival. Extracorporeal circulation can rescue a minority of highly selected patients with refractory cardiac arrest. Management of pulseless electrical activity is associated with poor outcomes, but it is hoped that a more targeted diagnostic approach, based on electrocardiography and bedside cardiac ultrasonography, may improve survival.

The evolution of postresuscitation care appears to have improved cardiac arrest outcomes in patients who are successfully resuscitated. The initial approach to early stabilization includes standard measures such as support of pulmonary function, hemodynamic stabilization, and rapid diagnostic assessment. Coronary angiography is often indicated because of the high frequency of unstable coronary artery disease in comatose survivors of cardiac arrest and should be performed early after resuscitation. Optimizing and standardizing these practices may further enhance outcomes.

### Do out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients have increased chances of survival when transported to a cardiac resuscitation center [^115Cj3ip]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

The initial electronic search yielded 2,727 references. A title and abstract screening left 31 potentially eligible citations. The search of gray literature, the second electronic search, and communications with authors of potentially eligible articles yielded an additional 5 citations, for a total of 36 included for the full-text review. Among these articles, a total of 24 were excluded for the following reasons: absence of comparison between cardiac centers and noncardiac centers (17), unknown availability of TTM (2), only abstract published (2), review article (1), availability of more recently published data from the same cohort (1), and included in-hospital cardiac arrest (1). A total of 12 studies were included in the narrative review and 11 in the meta-analysis.

- **Included studies**: All included articles were nonrandomized observational studies. It was possible to extract data regarding survival for 10 studies and regarding neurologic outcomes for 5 studies. One study only provided hazard ratios, which prevented its inclusion in the meta-analysis. Despite some adjusted results being available for all included studies, unadjusted results needed to be used in some analyses or sensitivity analyses for 2 studies because they were not provided for all the outcomes or populations pertaining to the present study.

### Risk-standardizing rates of return of spontaneous circulation for in-hospital cardiac arrest to facilitate hospital comparisons [^114uCv6n]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

Sustained return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) is the most direct measure of acute resuscitation quality in hospitals. However, currently, there are no validated tools for benchmarking hospital rates of ROSC following in-hospital cardiac arrest.

- **Methods and results**: Within the national Get With The Guidelines-Resuscitation registry, we identified 83,206 patients admitted from 335 hospitals from 2014 to 2017 with in-hospital cardiac arrest. We used hierarchical logistic regression to derive and validate a model for ROSC, defined as spontaneous and sustained ROSC for ≥ 20 consecutive minutes, from 24 pre-arrest variables. We calculated rates of risk-standardized ROSC for each hospital. Overall, the rates of ROSC were 72.0% and 72.7% for the derivation and validation cohorts, respectively. The model in the derivation cohort demonstrated moderate discrimination (C-statistic 0.643) and excellent calibration (R² of 0.996). Seventeen variables were associated with ROSC, and a parsimonious model retained 10 variables. Before risk adjustment, the median hospital ROSC rate was 70.5% (interquartile range: 64.7–76.9%; range: 33.3–89.6%). After adjustment, the distribution of risk-standardized ROSC rates was narrower, with a median of 71.9% (interquartile range: 68.2–76.4%; range: 42.2–84.6%). Overall, 56 (16.7%) of 335 hospitals experienced at least a 10% absolute change in percentile rank after risk standardization: 27 (8.0%) with a ≥ 10% negative percentile change and 29 (8.7%) with a ≥ 10% positive percentile change.

- **Conclusions**: We have derived and validated a model for assessing ROSC rates in hospitals.

### Temporal trends in characteristics and outcomes associated with in-hospital cardiac arrest: A 20-year analysis (1999–2018) [^115aL2iA]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). High credibility.

Tremendous advances in resuscitative as well as post–cardiac arrest care have been made over the past two decades, which is reflected by this analysis. The study of a nationally representative population reflects a gradual shift in in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) toward a younger albeit sicker population. This increase has been most marked in patients in the lowest quartile of median income. A clear transition in proportions of IHCA cases from larger-sized, rural hospitals toward smaller and medium-sized urban teaching hospitals is noted. Furthermore, we also observed an increased burden of comorbidities among patients with IHCA, which is consistent with recent data from the Get With The Guidelines registry.

Interestingly, the proportion of IHCAs associated with noncardiac admissions, such as sepsis, has increased substantially, whereas cardiac disorders such as acute myocardial infarction and heart failure have gradually declined. This is perhaps a consequence of advances in medical management of acute myocardial infarction and heart failure over the past two decades.

IHCA-related survival rates, especially in the setting of pulseless electrical activity (PEA)–asystole, have increased significantly over the past two decades, in alignment with reports by Thompson et al. and recent data from a Swedish registry. Ventricular tachycardia (VT)/ventricular fibrillation (VF)-related survival has plateaued in recent years after rapid initial improvements in outcomes at the turn of the century. These survival rates correlate well with data from the Get With The Guidelines registry, prior National Inpatient Sample (NIS)-based studies, and data from a Swedish registry, but were lower compared with the UK National Audit Project.

### Critical care management of patients after cardiac arrest: A scientific statement from the American Heart Association and Neurocritical Care Society [^113HBNwP]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

The complex physiological interplay among neurological, cardiac, and pulmonary systems necessitates individualized management of the patient after cardiac arrest (CA).

A more nuanced approach to identify individualized mean arterial pressure (MAP) targets for patients after CA may be through the assessment of cerebrovascular autoregulation to identify the threshold MAP below which autoregulation is lost (lower limit of autoregulation) and the optimal MAP (MAP OPT) at which cerebral perfusion is the least influenced by MAP fluctuations. Several studies have offered preliminary evidence that individual determination of MAP OPT in comatose post-CA survivors is a promising strategy to optimize cerebral perfusion and potentially minimize secondary brain injury.

Advances in invasive and noninvasive multimodal neuromonitoring may allow future approaches that optimize brain perfusion and oxygenation while balancing the potential concomitant cardiac and pulmonary effects of such interventions. For example, a lower MAP target may be beneficial in a patient after CA whose primary post-CA syndrome pathology is dominated by ongoing coronary ischemia and heart failure refractory to inotropic support. However, a higher MAP target may be beneficial in a patient after CA whose primary post-CA syndrome pathology is dominated by intracranial hypertension and brain hypoxia. Multimodal neuromonitoring may enable greater optimization of both neurological and systemic targets.

The role of neuromonitoring in titrating post-CA care to individuals is an important consideration in achieving optimal outcomes.

### Excluding the elephant in the room: Cardiac arrest [^112Z9DZ1]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

What are the barriers to creating parallel efforts for patients with cardiac arrest? Guideline recommendations for patients with cardiac arrest and postresuscitation ST elevations on ECG are limited but exist. They call for targeted temperature management as soon as possible and immediate angiography and percutaneous coronary intervention when indicated. These guidelines have been supported and codified by recently published performance and quality measures for acute myocardial infarction. However, even these recommendations are debated among practitioners and are challenging to measure. Readily identifiable, measurable, and achievable goals for postarrest care in STEMI are not yet established, and they require further and more comprehensive evaluation of both therapies and processes of care.

Preliminary and ongoing studies are evaluating potential strategies and metrics for postarrest care, ranging from prehospital targeted temperature management to direct transport of patients with arrest to percutaneous coronary intervention–capable hospitals. These studies carry promise, but much work remains to be done. Standards of care and measurable quality metrics are needed for cardiac arrest, like those that have been established for STEMI. Perhaps existing quality improvement networks, like Mission: Lifeline, can be leveraged to help identify these standards and metrics. Expanding data collection or specifying specific elements for patients with cardiac arrest within existing or emerging registries may help identify opportunities to improve care.
