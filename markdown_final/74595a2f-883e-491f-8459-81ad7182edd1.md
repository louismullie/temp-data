## Question

Mild-to-moderate spondylosis at multiple levels, with no central spinal stenosis or subluxation. At L4-L5, a small right subarticular disk herniation compresses the traversing right L5 nerve roots.

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the meaning and implications are, and how to manage an L4-L5 right subarticular disc herniation compressing the traversing right L5 nerve root, in the context of mild-to-moderate spondylosis at multiple levels with no central spinal stenosis or subluxation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the anatomic-imaging correlation to ensure the lesion explains L5 radiculopathy. Then, I should verify clinical correlation with history and examination and remember imaging can be positive even in asymptomatic patients. Next, I will review expected natural history and prognosis. After that, I will outline first-line conservative care and when to consider injections. Then, I will define clear surgical indications, choose among surgical approaches, and set outcome expectations with risks and costs. Finally, I will frame shared decision-making, follow-up, and red flags for urgent reassessment.

> Let me first confirm the anatomic pattern on imaging makes sense clinically, because a right subarticular or lateral recess L4-L5 herniation typically impinges the descending L5 root on its way to the L5-S1 foramen, producing an L5 radiculopathy distribution, and the report's absence of central canal stenosis or subluxation argues against syndromes like cauda equina or instability-driven symptoms in this case.

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions and label this L5 radiculopathy solely based on MRI, because abnormalities on lumbar MRI are common even in people without symptoms, so I should verify concordant clinical features such as lateral thigh and leg pain to the dorsum of the foot and great toe, first web-space paresthesia, and weakness of ankle and great-toe dorsiflexion, with exam maneuvers like a positive supine straight leg raise or Lasègue sign supporting the diagnosis when combined with dermatomal pain and neurologic findings [^113pSq1m] [^1136ySRX] [^117X8FP5].

> Wait, let me verify that the exam truly localizes to L5 and that I am not missing mimics or atypical patterns, because ipsilateral reflex changes can occur but are less reliable at L5, contralateral symptoms can rarely occur with ipsilateral herniation, and musculoskeletal mimics or peripheral neuropathies may confound the picture, which is why consistent dermatomal pain, provocation with cough or sneeze, and subjective weakness strengthen the pretest probability of true radiculopathy [^113pSq1m] [^114pJtVH] [^117X8FP5].

> I need to check imaging appropriateness and red flags as well, because uncomplicated acute radiculopathy often improves without immediate advanced imaging, but once symptoms persist beyond a trial of conservative care or if interventional or surgical pathways are considered, lumbar MRI without contrast is appropriate, and any red flags such as bowel or bladder dysfunction, progressive motor deficit, fever, or cancer history would necessitate accelerated imaging and referral [^1152weWt] [^1151j7Un].

> Next, I should review the natural history, since most lumbar disc herniations improve spontaneously over weeks to months, with surgery providing faster relief of leg pain in the short term but similar outcomes by one to two years compared with nonoperative care in many trials and systematic reviews, which sets important expectations for timing and thresholds of escalation [^115p4U5u].

> Let me think about prognosis specific to this case, because a small focal herniation without central stenosis or instability generally carries a favorable outlook, and I should also consider modifiable and nonmodifiable risk factors like BMI, smoking, and occupational lumbar load that are associated with incident LDH with radiculopathy, which can inform counseling and mitigation strategies during recovery [^115jxqtX] [^112NU18V] [^111yrhGS] [^116DeQZV].

> I will now examine first-line management, and I need to ensure the plan emphasizes education on the benign course, continuation of activity with avoidance of painful heavy flexion and lifting, NSAIDs or other simple analgesics as needed, and early, targeted physical therapy using directional preference and core stabilization while avoiding bed rest, which is supported by occupational medicine guidelines and expert consensus on staged conservative care across acute and subacute phases [^113bh6P7].

> Let me reconsider the role of injections if symptoms persist despite initial therapy, because a transforaminal epidural steroid injection targeting the L5 root can be considered to reduce inflammation and pain, and anatomical studies of the anterolateral epidural periradicular space support low-volume targeted delivery, though clinical decision-making should weigh benefits against transient risks and be integrated with ongoing rehabilitation [^113bh6P7] [^111rVzqj] [^1156awfv].

> Hold on, I should verify surgical indications and timing carefully, since absolute indications include cauda equina syndrome and progressive motor deficit that require urgent decompression, whereas relative indications in this scenario are persistent disabling leg-dominant pain with concordant imaging after about four to six weeks of appropriate conservative care, with surgery primarily expediting pain relief rather than changing long-term outcomes for most acute presentations [^113bh6P7] [^112nUiaX] [^1152weWt].

> Next, I should review the operative options matched to this pathology, because standard microdiscectomy remains the most evidence-based approach for a small subarticular L4-L5 herniation with L5 compression, minimally invasive tubular techniques achieve comparable long-term outcomes with potentially less tissue disruption, endoscopic techniques are evolving and can be effective in selected hands, and fusion is not indicated without deformity or instability in routine primary discectomy [^113Yzrjn] [^111AjsN3] [^113LFLyL] [^116LwMUt] [^1169Kw5h].

> I should double-check outcome expectations to counsel accurately, because surgery reduces leg pain more than nonoperative care in the first six months while functional differences are modest and often converge by one to two years, although in chronic sciatica persisting four to twelve months, randomized data show sustained superiority of microdiscectomy through at least one to two years, which can influence timing decisions if symptoms are prolonged [^115p4U5u] [^111CPR4z] [^111nR1Ks].

> I need to ensure the patient understands risks, trade-offs, and costs, as discectomy has low but real risks such as infection, dural tear, or nerve injury, reoperation for recurrence occurs in a minority, and cost-effectiveness analyses generally support surgery for appropriately selected patients seeking faster relief, while acknowledging that many will improve without surgery over time [^115p4U5u].

> But wait, what if the patient prioritizes avoiding surgery despite slower relief, or conversely needs a quicker return to heavy manual work, since preferences and occupational demands can reasonably shift the threshold toward continued conservative care versus earlier surgery after a structured four to six week trial with reassessment of pain and function, aligned with guideline recommendations [^114kY8YK] [^112nUiaX].

> Next, I should review follow-up and monitoring, planning early check-ins to ensure analgesia, activity progression, and physical therapy adherence, with formal reassessment around six weeks to quantify improvement and consider injection or surgical referral if progress is limited, while educating on urgent red flags such as new bowel or bladder dysfunction, saddle anesthesia, fever, or rapidly progressive weakness that require immediate evaluation [^1152weWt] [^114kY8YK].

> In summary, I should confirm that the diagnosis is L5 radiculopathy due to a small right subarticular L4-L5 herniation with favorable prognosis, initiate guideline-concordant conservative care with staged escalation, consider a targeted transforaminal epidural steroid injection if needed, reserve microdiscectomy or a minimally invasive equivalent for persistent, disabling leg-dominant pain after an adequate trial or for evolving neurologic deficit, avoid fusion in the absence of instability, and emphasize that most patients improve substantially without surgery while acknowledging that surgery offers faster pain relief when clinically and anatomically concordant [^115p4U5u] [^114kY8YK] [^112nUiaX] [^115p4U5u] [^1169Kw5h].

A small right subarticular L4-L5 disc herniation compressing the traversing right L5 nerve root can cause **L5 radiculopathy** with pain, sensory changes, and motor weakness in the L5 distribution [^117X8FP5]. Most patients improve with **conservative care** (NSAIDs, physical therapy, and selective nerve root blocks), but surgery is indicated for persistent or severe deficits [^115p4U5u] [^114kY8YK] [^111CPR4z]. Prognosis is **generally favorable**, with most patients regaining function and pain relief [^111nR1Ks]; however, recurrence is possible, so ongoing management and risk reduction remain important [^115p4U5u].

---

## Clinical significance and symptoms

Compression of the traversing right L5 nerve root typically causes **L5 radiculopathy**, characterized by [^117X8FP5]:

- **Pain**: Radiating from the lower back into the buttock, lateral thigh, lateral calf, and dorsum of the foot, often described as sharp, burning, or electric [^113pSq1m].

- **Sensory changes**: Numbness or tingling in the lateral leg and dorsum of the foot, particularly the great toe [^1136ySRX].

- **Motor weakness**: Weakness of ankle dorsiflexion (foot drop), toe extension, and hip abduction, affecting gait and balance [^113pSq1m].

- **Reflexes**: Reflexes are typically normal, but subtle changes may occur [^113pSq1m].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

Accurate diagnosis relies on correlating clinical findings with imaging [^1152weWt]. A focused neurologic examination, including straight leg raise and crossed straight leg raise, helps localize radiculopathy [^1136ySRX]. MRI is the **preferred modality** to confirm disc herniation and nerve root compression [^1151j7Un]. Electrodiagnostic studies (EMG and nerve conduction) can confirm radiculopathy and exclude mimics [^111hJa24].

---

## Conservative management

Initial management is **conservative**, as most patients improve without surgery [^115p4U5u] [^114m2weD]:

- **Medications**: NSAIDs, acetaminophen, and short-term muscle relaxants for pain control [^113bh6P7].

- **Physical therapy**: Core strengthening, flexibility, and aerobic conditioning to reduce pain and improve function [^113bh6P7].

- **Epidural steroid injections**: Selective nerve root blocks for persistent radicular pain [^113bh6P7] [^111rVzqj].

- **Activity modification**: Avoid heavy lifting and prolonged sitting; ergonomic adjustments at work [^113bh6P7].

---

## Indications for surgical intervention

Surgery is considered when **conservative measures fail** or severe deficits develop [^112nUiaX]:

- **Persistent symptoms**: Radiculopathy persisting beyond 6–12 weeks despite conservative care [^114kY8YK] [^111CPR4z].

- **Progressive neurological deficits**: Worsening motor weakness or sensory loss [^114kY8YK] [^112nUiaX].

- **Severe pain**: Intractable pain significantly impairing daily function [^114kY8YK].

- **Cauda equina syndrome**: Rare but urgent indication (not present in this case) [^112RMQdb].

---

## Surgical options and outcomes

The primary surgical option is **lumbar microdiscectomy**, which removes the herniated fragment to decompress the nerve root. Microdiscectomy is effective for **rapid pain relief and functional recovery** with low complication rates [^112nUiaX] [^111CPR4z]. Minimally invasive techniques offer comparable outcomes with less tissue disruption and faster recovery [^113Yzrjn]. Overall, most patients experience significant pain relief and functional improvement after surgery [^111nR1Ks]; recurrence rates are 5–15% [^112nUiaX].

---

## Prognosis and long-term outcomes

Prognosis is **generally favorable**. With conservative management, most patients improve within 6–12 weeks, though some have residual symptoms [^114m2weD] [^1152weWt]. Surgical management typically provides rapid relief and functional recovery; while recurrence can occur, it is often manageable [^112nUiaX] [^111CPR4z]. Long-term, most maintain good function and pain control; ongoing management helps reduce recurrence risk [^114m2weD] [^111nR1Ks].

---

## Potential complications if untreated

Untreated nerve root compression can lead to **chronic radicular pain** that diminishes quality of life [^114m2weD]. It may cause permanent neurological deficits — such as motor weakness, sensory loss, or foot drop [^111CPR4z] — as well as functional impairment, including reduced mobility, balance problems, and disability [^111nR1Ks]. Psychological impacts such as anxiety and depression further reduce quality of life [^114m2weD].

---

## Risk factors and preventive measures

Risk factors for lumbar disc herniation include age (middle-aged adults 30–50 years); occupational exposures such as heavy lifting, repetitive bending, and prolonged sitting; and lifestyle factors including smoking, obesity, and physical inactivity [^111yrhGS] [^115jxqtX] [^115Q14bg]. Preventive measures include regular **exercise** with core strengthening and aerobic activity, **ergonomic adjustments** and proper lifting techniques at work, and a **healthy lifestyle** with weight management and smoking cessation [^115jxqtX].

---

A small right subarticular L4-L5 disc herniation compressing the traversing right L5 nerve root can cause significant radiculopathy, but **most patients improve with conservative care**; surgery is reserved for persistent or severe deficits, and long-term outcomes are generally favorable [^111CPR4z] [^115p4U5u].

### Lumbar disc herniation: Diagnosis and management [^114m2weD]. The American Journal of Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

Lumbar disc herniations are common causes of lower back pain, neurological dysfunction, and buttock/leg pain. Herniation refers to the displacement of the nucleus pulposus of the intervertebral disc through the annulus fibrosus, thereby causing pressure on the neural elements. The sequelae of lumbar disc herniations range in severity from mild low back and buttock pain to severe cases of inability to ambulate and cauda equina syndrome. Diagnosis is achieved with a thorough history and physical examination along with advanced imaging. Treatment plans are dictated by corresponding patient symptoms, examination findings, and imaging results. Most patients can experience relief with nonsurgical measures; however, if symptoms persist or worsen, surgery may be appropriate.

### Surgical management of lumbar radiculopathy: A systematic review [^115p4U5u]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Lumbar radiculopathy is characterized by radiating pain with or without motor weakness or sensory disturbances; the point prevalence ranges from 1.6 to 13.4%. The objective of this review was to determine the efficacy, safety, and cost of surgical versus nonsurgical management of symptomatic lumbar radiculopathy in adults.

- **Methods**: We searched PubMed from January 1, 2007, to April 10, 2019, with hand searches of systematic reviews for studies prior to 2007. One reviewer extracted data and a second checked for accuracy. Two reviewers completed independent risk of bias and strength of evidence ratings.

- **Results**: We included seven RCTs (N = 1158) and three cost-effectiveness analyses. Surgery reduced leg pain by 6 to 26 points more than nonsurgical interventions, as measured on a 0- to 100-point visual analog scale of pain at up to 26 weeks follow-up; differences between groups did not persist at 1 year or later. The evidence was somewhat mixed for function and disability in follow-up through 26 weeks (standardized mean difference [SMD] -0.16 [95% CI, -0.30 to -0.03]); minimal differences were observed at 2 years (SMD -0.06 [95% CI, -0.20 to 0.07]). There were similar improvements in quality of life, neurologic symptoms, and return to work. No surgical deaths occurred, and surgical morbidity was infrequent. The incidence of reoperations ranged from 0 to 10%. The average cost per quality-adjusted life year gained from a healthcare payor perspective ranged from $51,156 to $83,322 for surgery compared to nonsurgical interventions.

### Musculoskeletal mimics of lumbosacral radiculopathy [^117X8FP5]. Muscle & Nerve (2025). Low credibility.

Radiculopathy is a syndrome of neurological impairment of sensory and/or motor function of a spinal nerve root that arises from nerve root injury or compression. Patients' symptoms and signs vary depending on which nerve root is affected, as outlined in Table 1 and Figure 1. Although the precise frequency of lumbosacral radiculopathies is unknown, the vast majority involve the L5 and/or S1 nerve roots, as the L4/L5 and L5/S1 intervertebral discs are the most likely to herniate. Depending on the direction of herniation, either the L5 and/or S1 nerve root can be affected. Like radiculopathy from disc herniation, radiculopathy due to other etiologies, including degenerative spondyloarthropathy, typically resolves spontaneously in weeks to months but may persist in some patients.

- **Common features of radiculopathies by level**: Radiculopathy often, but not always, includes radiating pain and/or sensory loss along dermatomal territories, and can be termed "sciatica" by patients and healthcare providers. The character of the pain may be neuropathic — burning, electric — or may be described as dull or aching. Patients may or may not have concomitant low back pain. Factors in history that correlate highly with nerve root impingement on imaging and/or radiculopathy on electrodiagnostic (EDX) testing include pain that radiates within a specific dermatome (odds ratio [OR] 4.1), pain with coughing or sneezing (OR 3.2), subjective muscle weakness (OR 2.2), and subjective sensory loss (OR 2.1).

### Invasive treatments for low back disorders [^114kY8YK]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for lumbar spinal stenosis, more specifically with respect to spinal decompression, the ACOEM 2021 guidelines recommend considering offering lumbar discectomy to speed recovery in patients with radiculopathy due to ongoing nerve root compression. This is particularly advised when there is a failure to improve significantly after 4–6 weeks of appropriate conservative therapy.

### Physical examination for lumbar radiculopathy due to disc herniation in patients with low-back pain [^1136ySRX]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Low-back pain with leg pain (sciatica) may be caused by a herniated intervertebral disc exerting pressure on the nerve root. Most patients will respond to conservative treatment; however, in carefully selected patients, surgical discectomy may provide faster relief of symptoms. Primary care clinicians use patient history and physical examination to evaluate the likelihood of disc herniation and select patients for further imaging and possible surgery.

- **Objectives**:
	1. To assess the performance of tests performed during physical examination (alone or in combination) to identify radiculopathy due to lower lumbar disc herniation in patients with low-back pain and sciatica.
	2. To assess the influence of sources of heterogeneity on diagnostic performance.

- **Search strategy**: We searched electronic databases for primary studies: PubMed (includes MEDLINE), EMBASE, and CINAHL, as well as systematic reviews: PubMed and Medion (all from the earliest until 30 April 2008), and checked references of retrieved articles.

- **Selection criteria**: We considered studies if they compared the results of tests performed during physical examination on patients with back pain with those of diagnostic imaging (MRI, CT, myelography) or findings at surgery.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors assessed the quality of each publication using the QUADAS tool and extracted details on patient and study design characteristics, index tests, and reference standard, as well as the diagnostic two-by-two table. We presented information on sensitivities and specificities with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI).

### Endoscope-assisted retroperitoneal prepsoas approach to lumbar intervertebral disk decompression. Technical note [^113LFLyL]. Operative Neurosurgery (2022). Low credibility.

Increasingly, there is an impetus on the part of surgeons to find more minimally invasive approaches to treat spinal pathologies. Retroperitoneal prepsoas and transpsoas approaches to the lumbar spine are one such example gaining increased attention. Endoscope-assisted approaches may help further reduce soft tissue dissection.

- **Objective**: To describe an endoscope-assisted lateral retroperitoneal prepsoas approach for lumbar diskectomy.

- **Methods**: Two fresh-frozen thoracolumbar cadaveric specimens were obtained and placed in the right lateral decubitus position. Using a left-sided, retroperitoneal prepsoas approach to the lumbar spine and under endoscopic visualization, diskectomies were performed at the L2/3, L3/4, L4/5, and L5/S1 intervertebral spaces. A qualitative assessment of the extent of central and contralateral foraminal decompression was performed.

- **Results**: The endoscope was found to provide effective visualization at all disk spaces and, combined with the anterior retroperitoneal prepsoas approach, allowed for effective decompression of all explored disk spaces. Both operators noted difficulty obtaining visualization of the ipsilateral foramen, but adequate central and contralateral foraminal decompression was achievable for central, paracentral, and contralateral far lateral disk protrusions.

- **Conclusion**: Endoscope assistance may improve visualization of the lumbar intervertebral disk spaces during retroperitoneal prepsoas approaches and thereby help to expand the surgical indication for anterior and oblique lumbar interbody fusion.

### Incidence of and risk factors for lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy in adults: a systematic review [^112NU18V]. European Spine Journal (2025). Low credibility.

What are the risk factors for LDH with radiculopathy in adults?

Our best evidence synthesis includes 25 cohort studies and 28 case-control studies informing on risk factor evidence (summarised in Tables 1 and 2, and fully detailed in Appendix 5 [Online Supplementary Material]). We report findings according to hierarchical phases of evidence, with phase III studies presenting the strongest (confirmatory) evidence of association. Throughout this section, we highlight risk factor estimates (point and 95% CI estimates) from low risk of bias phase III studies.

- **Infographic summarising findings**: The main findings of the systematic review are summarized, showing limits of annual incidence 95% CIs and modifiable risk factors for LDH with radiculopathy in adults. The lower and upper bound limits of the 95% CIs ranged from 0.3 to 2.7 per 1,000 persons for surgical case definitions, from 0.04 to 1.5 per 1,000 persons for hospital-based case definitions, and from 0.1 to 298.3 per 1,000 persons for clinical case definitions.

- **Potential modifiable risk factors**: Higher BMI, smoking, cardiovascular risk factors (in women), lower education, greater cumulative occupational lumbar load by forward bending postures and manual materials handling, increased time pressure at work, lower decision latitude at work, regular or irregular three-shift work, and regular night work (in women) are highlighted as modifiable risk factors for LDH with radiculopathy.

### Invasive treatments for low back disorders [^112nUiaX]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for low back pain, particularly in relation to spinal decompression, ACOEM 2021 guidelines recommend considering lumbar discectomy to expedite recovery in patients with radiculopathy due to persistent nerve root compression that does not significantly improve after 4–6 weeks of appropriate conservative therapy.

### Full-endoscopic visualized foraminoplasty and discectomy under general anesthesia in the treatment of L4-L5 and L5-S1 disc herniation [^111AjsN3]. Spine (2019). Low credibility.

This study was a retrospective analysis of clinical records aimed at evaluating the clinical outcomes and neurological complications of full-endoscopic visualized foraminoplasty and discectomy performed under general anesthesia for treating L4-L5 and L5-S1 disc herniation.

Full-endoscopic visualized foraminoplasty and discectomy, a newly developed technique, has been employed in the treatment of lumbar disc herniation and lumbar spinal stenosis. However, the clinical effect, safety, and neurological complications of the procedure when performed under general anesthesia remain uncertain.

Between May 2015 and April 2017, 84 patients with lumbar disc herniation were included in the study and divided into L4-L5 and L5-S1 groups based on the discectomy segment. The procedures were conducted under general anesthesia, with operative time, fluoroscopy time, hospitalization time, and complications all recorded. Patients were followed for a minimum of 12 months. Visual analog scale scores for leg and back pain, as well as Oswestry Disability Index scores, were evaluated preoperatively and at 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively. The modified MacNab criteria were also utilized to assess surgical effectiveness.

The results showed no significant difference in mean operative time, fluoroscopy time, or hospitalization time between the L4-L5 and L5-S1 groups. Additionally, there was a significant improvement in mean visual analog scale and Oswestry Disability Index scores postoperatively.

### Guideline update for the performance of fusion procedures for degenerative disease of the lumbar spine. Part 8: Lumbar fusion for disc herniation and radiculopathy [^116LwMUt]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine (2014). Low credibility.

Patients suffering from a lumbar herniated disc typically present with signs and symptoms consistent with radiculopathy. They may also experience low-back pain, although the source of this pain is less certain, as it may result from the degenerative process that led to the herniation. The surgical alternative of choice remains lumbar discectomy, but fusions have been performed for both primary and recurrent disc herniations.

In the original guidelines, the inclusion of a fusion for routine discectomies was not recommended. This recommendation continues to be supported by more recent evidence. Based on low-level evidence, the incorporation of a lumbar fusion may be considered an option when herniation is associated with evidence of spinal instability, chronic low-back pain, and/or severe degenerative changes, or if the patient participates in heavy manual labor.

For recurrent disc herniations, there is low-level evidence to support the inclusion of lumbar fusion for patients with evidence of instability or chronic low-back pain.

### Moderators of cognitive outcomes from an exercise program in people with mild to moderate dementia [^116RVWRL]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2020).

Our aim was to estimate whether baseline participant variables were able to moderate the effect of an exercise intervention on cognition in patients with mild to moderate dementia.

- **Design**: Subgroup analysis of a multicenter pragmatic randomized controlled trial.

- **Setting**: Community-based gym/rehabilitation centers.

- **Participants**: A total of 494 community-dwelling participants with mild to moderate dementia.

- **Intervention**: Participants were randomized to a moderate- to high-intensity aerobic and strength exercise program or a usual care control group. Experimental group participants attended twice-weekly 60- to 90-minute gym sessions for 4 months. Participants were prescribed home exercises for an additional hour per week during the supervised period and 150 minutes each week after the supervised period.

- **Measurements**: Multilevel regression model analyses were undertaken to identify individual moderators of cognitive function measured through the Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale score at 12 months.

- **Results**: When tested for a formal interaction effect, only cognitive function assessed by the baseline number cancellation test demonstrated a statistically significant interaction effect (-2.7 points; 95% confidence interval = -5.14 to -0.21).

- **Conclusion**: People with worse number cancellation test scores may experience greater progression of cognitive decline in response to a moderate- to high-intensity exercise program. Further analyses to examine whether these findings can be replicated in planned sufficiently powered analyses are indicated.

### Evaluation and treatment of lumbar facet cysts [^116GAMMH]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2016). Low credibility.

Lumbar facet cysts are a rare but increasingly common cause of symptomatic nerve root compression and can lead to radiculopathy, neurogenic claudication, and cauda equina syndrome. The cysts arise from the zygapophyseal joints of the lumbar spine and commonly demonstrate synovial herniation with mucinous degeneration of the facet joint capsule. Lumbar facet cysts are most common at the L4-L5 level and often are associated with spondylosis and degenerative spondylolisthesis. Advanced imaging studies have increased the diagnosis of the cysts; however, optimal treatment of the cysts remains controversial. First-line treatment is nonsurgical management consisting of oral NSAIDs, physical therapy, bracing, epidural steroid injections, and/or cyst aspiration. Given the high rate of recurrence and the relatively low satisfaction with nonsurgical management, surgical options, including hemilaminectomy or laminotomy to excise the cyst and decompress the neural elements, are typically performed. Recent studies suggest that segmental fusion of the involved levels may decrease the risks of cyst recurrence and radiculopathy.

### Discectomy compared with standardized nonoperative care for chronic sciatica due to a lumbar disc herniation: A secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial with 2-year follow-up [^111nR1Ks]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery. American Volume (2021). High credibility.

Randomized controlled trials evaluating acute sciatica have not demonstrated prolonged improvements in terms of patient-reported pain and function. For chronic sciatica, however, microdiscectomy has been found to be superior at 1 year. Whether this effect persists during the second year is not known. The purpose of this study was to report the 2-year outcomes following lumbar microdiscectomy as compared with standardized nonoperative care for the treatment of chronic sciatica resulting from a lumbar disc herniation.

- **Methods**: The study is a secondary analysis of a previously reported randomized controlled trial with extension to 2 years of follow-up. Patients with radiculopathy for 4 to 12 months resulting from an L4-L5 or L5-S1 disc herniation were randomized to microdiscectomy or 6 months of nonoperative care, followed by surgery if needed. Intention-to-treat analysis was performed at 2 years for the primary outcome (the intensity of leg pain) (range of possible scores, 0 [no pain] to 10 [worst pain]) as well as for secondary outcomes, including the Oswestry Disability Index score, the intensity of back pain, and quality of life.

- **Results**: One hundred and twenty-eight patients were randomized in the study. Twenty-four (38%) of the 64 patients who had been randomized to nonoperative care crossed over to surgical treatment by 2 years following enrollment. At the 2-year time point, the follow-up rate was approximately 70%. At 2 years, the operative group had less leg pain than the nonoperative group (mean, 2.8 ± 0.4 compared with 4.2 ± 0.4).

### Ten-step minimally invasive treatment of lumbar giant disc herniation via unilateral tubular laminotomy for bilateral decompression: 2-dimensional operative video [^111LenyA]. Operative Neurosurgery (2021). Low credibility.

Giant disc herniation (GDH) is generally defined as a lumbar disc herniation that obstructs 50% or more of the space in the spinal canal. Common treatment options for GDH include unilateral interlaminar approach, bilateral approach, or open full laminectomy. Surgical treatment of GDH may be challenging because severe bilateral compression of neural elements in the spinal canal increases the risk of iatrogenic injury to nerve roots and dura. The surgical approach can be further complicated by calcification, hardening, and dehydration of the GDH tissue. The prevailing opinion in the literature is that giant disc herniations cannot safely be treated via tubular minimally invasive approaches.

In this video, we present a case of a 52-year-old male patient with a history of progressive low back pain that radiates bilaterally from the buttocks toward the posterior legs and knees for 2 years due to a GDH at the L4–5 level. The patient was treated via a tubular "over-the-top" minimally invasive decompression to first provide generous bilateral decompression of neural elements and dura. After sufficient decompression at the surgical level, the discectomy was performed via an ipsilateral piecemeal resection of the GDH. The "over-the-top" contralateral mobilization of disc herniation was also achieved with this approach, facilitating the removal of the entire disc fragment. Patient consent was obtained prior to performing the procedure. Therefore, GDH should not be considered a contraindication for tubular decompression when this modified technique is performed.

### Minimally invasive lumbar foraminotomy [^111x343x]. Neurosurgical Focus (2013). Low credibility.

Lumbar radiculopathy is a common problem where nerve root compression can occur along various parts of the nerve root's course, including in the foramina. Minimally invasive approaches facilitate easier exposure of the lateral foramina and decompression of the nerve root within the foramina. This video demonstrates a minimally invasive technique to decompress the lumbar nerve root in the foramina, utilizing a lateral to medial decompression.

### Incidence of and risk factors for lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy in adults: a systematic review [^115jxqtX]. European Spine Journal (2025). High credibility.

Lumbar disc herniation (LDH) with radiculopathy is associated with greater pain, disability, healthcare use, and costs compared with nonspecific low back pain. Reliable information about its incidence and risk factors was lacking.

- **Questions**: (1) What is the incidence of lumbar disc herniation (LDH) with radiculopathy in adults? (2) What are the risk factors for LDH with radiculopathy in adults?

- **Methods**: Systematic review. We searched five electronic databases from 1970 to September 2023. Eligible cohort and case-control studies were identified and independently assessed for risk of bias. A qualitative best evidence synthesis of low and moderate risk of bias studies was conducted.

- **Results**: We critically reviewed 87 studies and synthesized data from 59 (68%) studies; 12 were of low and 47 of moderate risk of bias. The lower and upper bound limits of the 95% confidence intervals of annual incidence estimates ranged from 0.3 to 2.7 per 1000 persons for surgical case definitions, from 0.04 to 1.5 per 1000 persons for hospital-based case definitions, and from 0.1 to 298.3 per 1000 persons for clinical case definitions. Factors associated with the development of LDH with radiculopathy included middle age (30–50 years), smoking, higher BMI, presence of cardiovascular risk factors (in women), and greater cumulative occupational lumbar load due to forward bending postures and manual materials handling, with effect sizes ranging from 1.1 (1.0–1.3) to 3.7 (2.3–6.0).

- **Conclusions**: Incidence of LDH varies in different populations and according to case definition. Risk factors are identified based on this systematic review.

### Incidence of and risk factors for lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy in adults: a systematic review [^111yrhGS]. European Spine Journal (2025). Low credibility.

We found evidence that mid-age (30–50 years compared with younger adults) was associated with the development of lumbar disc herniation (LDH) with radiculopathy, with the strength of associations ranging from 1.3 (1.2–1.5) to 1.8 (1.5–2.0). Jhawar et al. reported an association of LDH with radiculopathy and smoking in women (vs. nonsmokers), with a risk ratio of 1.4 (1.3–1.5). High cholesterol, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, a higher BMI, and a positive family history of coronary heart disease were also associated with the risk of LDH with radiculopathy in women, with associations ranging from 1.1 (1.0–1.3) to 1.5 (1.2–2.0). The associations between LDH with radiculopathy and greater cumulative occupational lumbar load by forward bending postures and manual materials handling ranged from 1.6 (1.1–2.7) to 3.7 (2.3–6.0). Two studies found weak to moderate associations of LDH with radiculopathy and whole-body vibration, with 95% confidence intervals indicating both narrow (OR 1.4 [1.1–1.6]) and wide (OR 1.8 [0.4–9.0]) ranges of plausible true risk estimates. Prolonged sitting combined with moderate-to-vigorous physical activity in leisure time was also associated with LDH, with risk estimates ranging from 1.3 (1.1–1.6) to 2.2 (1.1–4.2).

The strength of associations for LDH with radiculopathy in males (vs. females) ranged from 1.3 to 2.2 (1.3–6.3) in low risk of bias studies. Mattila et al. reported an increased risk for LDH in persons participating in sports 4–5 times per week (vs. never; HR 2.7 [1.1–6.3]). Mental stress and the number of psychological distress symptoms were also associated.

### The unique characteristics of "upper" lumbar disc herniations [^1125kqNm]. Neurosurgery (2004). Low credibility.

To compare the characteristics, presentation, and surgical outcomes of patients with microdiscectomies at L1-L2 and L2-L3 with those treated at L3-L4, we conducted a study. We further sought to compare these results with those reported in the literature for discectomies at the L4-L5 and L5-S1 levels.

- **Methods**: We reviewed the clinical data collected from 69 patients who had 72 L1-L2, L2-L3, and L3-L4 microdiscectomies performed from 1989 to 1999 at the New York University Medical Center. Patients who had surgery at L1-L2 or L2-L3 were grouped and compared with those treated at the L3-L4 level. Patients' charts were retrospectively reviewed at a mean of 12.9 months after surgery for presenting signs and symptoms, patient characteristics, and surgical outcomes. Long-term follow-up via telephone interview was obtained at an average of 81.3 months after surgery.

- **Results**: In the L1-L2 + L2-L3 group, 58% of the patients had previous lumbar disc surgery, compared with only 10% of those in the L3-L4 group. Additionally, 20% in the L1-L2 + L2-L3 group required a fusion during the procedure compared with only 10% in the L3-L4 group. These differences are both statistically significant. The short-term chart review demonstrates that only 58% and 53% of patients in the L1-L2 + L2-L3 group were improved with regard to radicular and back pain, respectively. In contrast, those in the L3-L4 group reported 94% and 87% rates of improvement in the same categories, both highly statistically significant findings. The long-term follow-up confirmed a highly statistically significantly worse outcome in the L1-L2 + L2-L3 group.

### Rates of future lumbar fusion in patients with cauda equina syndrome treated with decompression [^112RMQdb]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. Global Research & Reviews (2022). High credibility.

Cauda equina syndrome (CES) is a rare but serious condition that results from compression of the lumbar and sacral nerve roots. The most common cause is lumbar disk herniation, although a variety of etiologies, including spinal neoplasm, abscess, epidural hematoma, and trauma, have been reported. Patients experiencing CES often present with an array of symptoms, including low back pain; lower extremity weakness; perianal hypoesthesia; and bowel, bladder, or sexual dysfunction.

Management of CES centers around decompression of the spinal nerve roots. CES caused by disk herniation is commonly treated with laminectomy and diskectomy at the level of the herniation. However, a number of decompression techniques can be conducted, varying by the specific compressive pathology. A full or wide laminectomy with generous bone removal is often conducted in patients with CES, as compared with a partial laminectomy for uncomplicated disk herniation or lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS). The timing of decompression for CES is also of considerable interest in the literature. The generally accepted view is that decompression should be conducted within 48 hours of the onset of symptoms because multiple studies have demonstrated improved neurological outcomes when treatment occurs within this indicated window. Thus, these potentially challenging operations are often conducted on an urgent basis with less-than-optimal conditions.

Although concomitant lumbar fusion may be conducted during the index decompression procedure, most patients with CES are treated with decompression alone.

### Anatomical and surgical study of volume determination of the anterolateral epidural space nerve root L5/S1 under the aspect of epidural perineural injection in minimal invasive treatment of lumbar nerve root compression [^1156awfv]. European Spine Journal (2011). Low credibility.

The living measurement during operation aimed to distinguish potential differences between volume determination in cadavers and living humans. Beyond the collected experimental data using the dental filling procedure in the anatomical laboratory, operative measurements were performed in the theatre. All patients provided informed consent, and operations were undertaken by one of two experienced senior spine surgeons.

Measurements were conducted on patients undergoing spine surgery for the removal of herniated discs in the L5/S1 segment. Post-operation, the available anterolateral epidural space L5/S1 was filled with 0.9% saline using a bulb-headed cannula under visual control. Significant bleeding during surgery was a criterion for exclusion from volume determination. A total of 21 measurements were performed, with saline volume ranging from 0.6 to 1.5 mL and a mean value of 0.9 ml. The saline fluid level remained constant within the filled epidural space. This interesting finding is interpreted by our group as indicative of the anatomical closeness of the anterolateral epidural space.

### Decompression alone versus decompression with instrumented fusion in the treatment of lumbar degenerative spondylolisthesis: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised trials [^115RBKWX]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2023). High credibility.

The search strategy was modeled based on the North American Spine Society's Diagnosis and Treatment of Degenerative Lumbar Spondylolisthesis. It was modified by information specialists and validated by clinical experts and an evidence synthesis expert. A three-step search strategy was used to identify both published and unpublished studies.

A limited search was conducted in MEDLINE (Ovid) and EMBASE (Ovid), using the keywords and index terms 'lumbar spondylolisthesis' and 'fusion'. The analysis of the text words in the title and abstract and the index terms used to describe articles followed.

In May 2022, an information specialist conducted a comprehensive search including MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase (Ovid), Emcare (Ovid), Cochrane Library, CINAHL (EBSCO), and Scopus. Sources of grey literature included ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global and registers of clinical trials: ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (see online supplemental appendix A). The reference lists of relevant publications were screened for additional eligible studies. No time, study design, language, geographical, or other restrictions were applied. Retrieved records were imported into Endnote V.X9.2 (Clarivate Analytics, Pennsylvania), and duplicates were removed according to the method described by Bramer et al. Search strategies were downloaded or manually copied from each database or register and saved in a Microsoft Word document.

Two reviewers (LK and DT) independently screened the titles and abstracts, as well as the full texts of the potentially eligible studies.

### Altered function of lumbar nerve roots in patients with transitional lumbosacral vertebrae [^114u6dvi]. Spine (2004). Low credibility.

A retrospective study was conducted focusing on the preoperative neurologic symptoms of patients with lumbar herniated discs. The objective was to evaluate the possibility that the muscle innervation pattern and the sensory dermatomes of lumbar nerve roots are altered when a lumbosacral transitional vertebra is present. In 1962, McCulloch et al. suggested with intraoperative recordings that the innervation pattern of the lumbar nerve roots may be altered when a lumbosacral transitional vertebra is present; however, this result was not replicated in the study by Young et al. in 1983.

We retrospectively reviewed the charts of 62 consecutive patients who underwent microdiscectomy for lumbar herniated discs. Lumbarized S1 vertebra was present in 10 of these 62 patients (16%). Among these 10 patients, 8 had herniated discs at L5-S1 compressing the S1 nerve root. In the 52 patients with a normal configuration, 22 had herniated discs at L5-S1 compressing the S1 nerve root, and 15 had herniated discs at L4-L5 compressing the L5 nerve root. The preoperative neurologic symptoms caused by the S1 nerve root compression in the patients with lumbarized S1 vertebrae were compared with those caused by either L5 or S1 nerve root compression in the patients with a normal configuration.

The distribution of motor weakness caused by the S1 nerve root compression was significantly different between the patients with lumbarized S1 and those with the normal configuration.

### The current role and future directions of imaging in failed back surgery syndrome patients: an educational review [^112kzYba]. Insights into Imaging (2022). Low credibility.

- **MRI findings**: MRI of the lumbar spine demonstrates a large disk herniation at level L5–S1. A sagittal T2-weighted MRI depicts disk protrusion at this level, showing a close relation with the cauda equina roots. An axial T2-weighted MRI shows the protruding disk at level L5–S1 occupying part of the central zone and right subarticular zone, displacing the cauda equina roots to the contralateral side of the dural sac.

- **Postoperative imaging**: Axial MRI of the postoperative lumbar spine at level L4–L5 includes:
	- **Axial T2-weighted image**: Soft tissue occupies the subarticular zone bilaterally, with intermediate signal intensity. The cauda equina roots are displaced and course more centrally in the dural sac.
	- **Axial T1-weighted image**: Shows the tissue characteristics of the known soft tissue in the bilateral subarticular zone. Native T1-weighted images reveal an intermediate signal intensity.
	- **Post-contrast axial T1-weighted image**: Displays homogeneous enhancement of the known soft tissue in the subarticular zone bilaterally. Based on this enhancement, a suggestion of postoperative epidural fibrosis was made.

### Surgical techniques for sciatica due to herniated disc, a systematic review [^1143HHux]. European Spine Journal (2012). Low credibility.

- **Risk of bias assessment**: Risk of bias was assessed with the 12-item criteria list recommended by the Cochrane Back Review Group (CBRG). These criteria are given in Table 3, including operationalization. The items were scored with 'yes' (+), 'no' (-), or 'unsure' (?). Studies were categorized as having a 'low risk of bias' when at least six of the 12 criteria were met, and the study had no serious methodological flaws, such as extensive loss to follow-up or invalidating trial stop.

	- The risk of bias was assessed independently by two review authors (SR, MvM), who met again to reach consensus. If consensus could not be reached, a third review author (BK) was consulted to resolve the disagreement. The risk of bias assessment in the Cochrane review did not include all items of the tool used within the Cochrane Back Review Group. Selective outcome reporting, similarity of groups at baseline, and co-interventions were additionally assessed for this review.

### Incidence of and risk factors for lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy in adults: a systematic review [^115Q14bg]. European Spine Journal (2025). High credibility.

Our review was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 statement. Details of our protocol were registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO No. CRD42011001197). This review was initially conducted in partial fulfillment of a doctoral dissertation in epidemiology as an unpublished manuscript, which we updated through September 2023.

- **Data sources and search strategy**: We systematically searched Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central Trials Registry, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Database of Abstracts Related to Effects; initially from 1970 to March 2016. In February 2022, we conducted an update and identified records published between April 2016 and January 2022. We ran a final search update to 21 September 2023. Search strategies combined terms from three key concepts: intervertebral disc herniation, lumbar spine, and etiology, and were developed in consultation with an experienced information specialist (Appendix 1 in Online Supplementary Material). The reference lists of all eligible studies were also searched for additional relevant studies.

- **Eligibility criteria**: Eligible studies were published in English, French, or Spanish and used cohort, case–control, or randomised trial designs (only potentially eligible for risk factor evidence) to examine the incidence of and/or risk factors for lumbar disc herniation (LDH) with radiculopathy in adults aged 18 years or older. We excluded studies of asymptomatic LDH, or LDH due to neoplasm, infection, fracture, dislocation, or surgery complications.

### An algorithmic approach to treating lumbar spinal stenosis: An evidenced-based approach [^113wgqNn]. Pain Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Endoscopic decompression (for foraminal stenosis)

Minimally invasive discectomy can achieve decompression through nucleotomy and indirectly relieve pressure on the exiting nerve root, whereas minimally invasive transforaminal endoscopic decompression procedures can achieve spinal decompression through either a direct or an indirect approach. These techniques may vary according to the type of stenosis, including interlaminar, transforaminal percutaneous endoscopic decompression, or endoscopic lumbar foraminotomy.

Sclafani et al. performed a post hoc analysis of an intracanal endoscopic decompression technique evaluating 86 patients with disc herniation or foraminal stenosis. The authors showed that there was a significant improvement in pain and functional outcome scores up to one year after the procedure. Patients with foraminal stenosis showed improvement in back and leg pain at one year but did not show an overall improvement in ODI scores, with a one-year re-operation rate of 28% compared with 2% in patients with disc herniation.

In another study, patients who underwent percutaneous endoscopic transforaminal lumbar spinal canal decompression for LSS were evaluated and showed significant improvement in terms of pain relief and ODI scores at final follow-up when compared with baseline values. Two (3%) of the patients had a relapse and had subsequent open decompression surgery. Similar pain relief and functional improvement was found for lateral recess stenosis in geriatric patients using the same percutaneous endoscopic decompression via transforaminal approach.

### Musculoskeletal mimics of lumbosacral radiculopathy [^113pSq1m]. Muscle & Nerve (2025). Low credibility.

Physical examination tests have poor sensitivity and/or specificity for identifying radiculopathy when used in isolation, whether radiculopathy is due to disc herniation or other causes. Nevertheless, recommended physical examination maneuvers for the diagnosis of lumbosacral radiculopathy include manual muscle testing (positive predictive value [PPV] of ankle dorsiflexion weakness 69% and lateral four toe extension weakness 76% for L4/5 radiculopathy), sensory testing (PPV 76% and 50% for sensory abnormalities in the L5 and S1 dermatomes, respectively), supine straight leg raise (sensitivity 0.67, superior to the seated straight leg raise, sensitivity 0.41), supine Lasegue's sign (sensitivity 0.77–0.83), and supine crossed Lasegue's sign (specificity 0.74–0.89).

Other physical examination maneuvers which may aid in diagnosing lumbosacral radiculopathy include reflexes at the patellar and Achilles tendons. Ipsilateral absent or reduced reflexes at the patellar tendon (sensitivity 0.18–0.67; specificity 0.66–0.90) and Achilles tendon (sensitivity 0.14–0.67; specificity 0.60–0.93) suggest patients may have L4 or L5/S1 radiculopathies, respectively.

Imaging modalities, particularly MRI, are frequently used to investigate low back pain and/or suspected radiculopathy. However, abnormalities on MRI are highly prevalent even among persons who are asymptomatic. Consequently, resource stewardship organizations such as Choosing Wisely USA and Choosing Wisely Canada, as well as numerous specialty societies, recommend judicious selection of patients who require imaging.

### Anatomical and surgical study of volume determination of the anterolateral epidural space nerve root L5/S1 under the aspect of epidural perineural injection in minimal invasive treatment of lumbar nerve root compression [^111rVzqj]. European Spine Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Herniated intervertebral discs cause numerous cases of lumbar nerve root compression, especially in the L5/S1 segment. Other contributors to lumbar spinal root stress include spinal canal stenosis and postdiscotomy syndrome. For patients without neurological deficiencies, conservative treatments incorporate various epidural injection techniques, commonly utilizing steroids. A precise injection method requiring a small drug volume is the epidural perineural approach, which employs a special two-needle technique. The anatomical spaces of the nerve roots have historically received limited attention in therapeutic contexts.

We determined the anterolateral epidural space nerve volume of the nerve root L5/S1 and compared data collected in an anatomical study with operative measurements during discectomy procedures. Volume determination in human cadavers was conducted by filling the anterolateral space with liquid silicone following dissection. In vivo measurements were acquired during surgery at the anterolateral space site post-discectomy. Anatomical studies provided a mean volume value of 1.1 ml, while surgical volume determinations resulted in a mean volume of 0.9 ml.

A better understanding of the anterolateral epidural space may facilitate a reduction in injection volume for conservative treatment of nerve root compression. This is particularly relevant when using the epidural perineural technique, as it can help avoid the side effects associated with high doses of steroids.

### Comparison of neuropathic pain and neuronal apoptosis following nerve root or spinal nerve compression [^1124TteH]. European Spine Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Although lumbar radiculopathy leads to nociceptive pain, its mechanisms are not completely known. Animal models indicate that axonal degeneration following peripheral nerve injury causes neuropathic pain, but demyelination alone does not. These effects are related to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha. TNF-alpha expression is upregulated in endoneurial macrophages and Schwann cells following axonal injury and results in neuropathic pain. Injection of epidural, subcutaneous, or intraneural TNF-alpha produces allodynia. The application of TNF-alpha to the nerve roots also produces neuropathologic changes and behavior deficits. Further evidence that TNF-alpha is important in radiculopathy is the finding that inhibition of TNF-alpha by selective antibody therapy prevents changes in nerve pathology, such as thrombus formation and intraneural edema, reduction of nerve conduction velocity, and pain behavior.

TNF-alpha is an important mediator of apoptosis of peripheral and central neurons because TNF-alpha receptor 1 (p55 receptor), which is associated with apoptosis and cytokine production, is upregulated in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) after peripheral nerve injury. Nerve crush injury 2 mm distal to the DRG induces Wallerian degeneration and DRG apoptosis. Likewise, nerve injury 2 mm proximal to the DRG induces apoptosis in the spinal cord and pain behavior, which anti-TNF-alpha therapy reduces. We have reported previously that compression of the cauda equina (more than 2 mm proximal to the DRG) induces either demyelination.

### Anatomical and surgical study of volume determination of the anterolateral epidural space nerve root L5/S1 under the aspect of epidural perineural injection in minimal invasive treatment of lumbar nerve root compression [^111Y2DpM]. European Spine Journal (2011). Low credibility.

The volume determination was performed with liquid silicone, a material regularly used by dental surgeons to perform dental impressions. This impression material is fluid and, to start the time-dependent curing procedure, the components are mixed in a cylinder to form a soft crosslinked material layer. The application is done directly from the cylinder (Fig. 2). The method's advantages include the dispersion of the viscous material only under pressure and visual control by the examiner. The hardening process is fast, and once set, the dental silicone is easy to remove. It does not adhere to anatomical structures, allowing complete removal of the silicone filling in one piece using a forceps for the removal of herniated discs (Fig. 3).

- **Filling and removal process**:
	- Fig. 2 demonstrates the filling of the anterolateral epidural space with dental silicone. Fig. 3 illustrates the removal of silicone for measurement using forceps.

The volume measurement was performed using the principle of water displacement. The graduated measuring glass had a volume of 5 mL and was scaled in 0.1 mL intervals. Each epidural space of 11 spinal cadavers underwent the complete procedure four times. One cadaver was measured only on the right side, as the left side was damaged during dissection and excluded from further investigation. All registrations were performed independently by a second examiner.

### Incidence of and risk factors for lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy in adults: A systematic review [^116DeQZV]. European Spine Journal (2025). High credibility.

Our review highlights existing gaps in the knowledge of the etiology of lumbar disc herniation (LDH) with radiculopathy. Better quality, low-risk-of-bias descriptive and analytic investigations are needed, as the incidence and risk factors of this disabling and costly condition have not been adequately described or examined in the literature, especially in the general population. Furthermore, incidence density rates are preferable to cumulative incidence estimates since they provide a more accurate measure of the population-time at risk and a more accurate estimate of the rate at which an outcome occurs.

Future research should clearly and explicitly describe their source and target populations and issues related to their sampling frames. Accurate and complete ascertainment of both the cases developing the outcome and the at-risk population (i.e. the population at risk of experiencing the outcome) are required to produce valid incidence estimates. To reduce the amount of information bias surrounding the diagnosis and case definitions of LDH with radiculopathy, there is a need for workable clinical and surveillance definitions of LDH with radiculopathy and subsequent validation studies. For example, in their 1997 study evaluating the accuracy of diagnostic codes for identifying spinal disorders in health administrative databases, Faciszewski et al. reported that hospital discharge codes for LDH had a high positive predictive value (93%) compared with physician chart review. More recently, Genevay and colleagues developed and validated clinical classification criteria to identify patient.

### Minimally invasive discectomy versus microdiscectomy/open discectomy for symptomatic lumbar disc herniation [^113Yzrjn]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Microdiscectomy or open discectomy (MD/OD) are standard procedures for symptomatic lumbar disc herniation. They involve removing the portion of the intervertebral disc compressing the nerve root or spinal cord, with or without the aid of a headlight loupe or microscope magnification. Potential advantages of newer minimally invasive discectomy (MID) procedures over standard MD/OD include less blood loss, less postoperative pain, shorter hospitalization, and earlier return to work.

- **Objectives**: To compare the benefits and harms of MID versus MD/OD for management of lumbar intervertebral discopathy.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (November 2013), MEDLINE (1946 to November 2013), and EMBASE (1974 to November 2013) with no language restrictions. We also contacted experts in the field for additional studies and reviewed reference lists of relevant studies.

- **Selection criteria**: We selected randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-randomized controlled trials (QRCTs) that compared MD/OD with a MID (percutaneous endoscopic interlaminar or transforaminal lumbar discectomy, transmuscular tubular microdiscectomy, and automated percutaneous lumbar discectomy) for treatment of adults with lumbar radiculopathy secondary to discopathy. We evaluated the following primary outcomes: pain related to sciatica or low back pain (LBP) as measured by a visual analogue scale, sciatic specific outcomes such as neurological deficit of lower extremity or bowel/urinary incontinence, and functional outcomes.

### Invasive treatments for low back disorders [^116djsME]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for low back pain, more specifically with respect to spinal decompression, the ACOEM 2021 guidelines recommend not offering discectomy to treat acute, subacute, or chronic low back pain without radiculopathy.

### T1-t2 disk herniation presenting with Horner syndrome: A case report with literary review [^114W9Zeo]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Surgical approaches to thoracic disk herniations correlate with patient anatomy, location of nerve root compression, and surgeon familiarity. While the anterior approach tends to be more familiar to most spine surgeons, certain anatomic restrictions may limit its use for T1-T2. Posterior approach surgery has most commonly been used for laminectomy and/or foraminotomy. Adequate disk access of more central disk herniations may not be accomplished without excessive facet resection leading to hypermobility. Successful Smith-Robinson approaches to T1-T2 have been achieved, whereas partial sternotomy has been used in others. Thoracic disk herniations can be approached posteriorly when little to no retraction of the spinal cord is necessary for disk access. Central disk herniations or those that compromise up to 50% across the disk space are often approached through an anterior approach, as effective decompression cannot be completed from a posterior-only approach. With this technique, there is no retraction of the neural elements, no sacrifice of the nerve roots, and the pedicles are spared. When considering anterior surgery, identify the level of the clavicles, sternum, and breast tissue in relation to the upper thoracic levels for adequate preoperative planning. Anterior approaches are useful but more involved. A modified anterior approach to the cervicothoracic junction with clavicle resection or combined cervicothoracic approach for diskectomy has proven useful as well.

Overall, outcomes for T1 disk herniations treated surgically are favorable. Most studies report improved results.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® low back pain: 2021 update [^1152weWt]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2021). High credibility.

In the United States, acute low back pain, with or without radiculopathy, is the leading cause of years lived with disability and the third-ranking cause of disability-adjusted life-years. Uncomplicated acute low back pain and/or radiculopathy is a benign, self-limited condition that does not warrant any imaging studies. Imaging is considered in those patients who have had up to six weeks of medical management and physical therapy that resulted in little or no improvement in their back pain. It is also considered for those patients presenting with red flags, raising suspicion for a serious underlying condition, such as cauda equina syndrome, malignancy, fracture, or infection.

- **American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria®**: These are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### An algorithmic approach to treating lumbar spinal stenosis: An evidence-based approach [^113yMDUN]. Pain Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

In general, although open decompression surgery allows for direct visualization of the decompression site and has been shown to be safe and effective in the majority of patients, the procedure is also associated with higher morbidity, secondary spinal instability, longer recovery time, and more risks, and might be less tolerated in patients with advanced age. The decision of whether to perform decompression surgery alone or to combine it with fusion is largely based on the clinical judgment of the surgeon. Generally, multilevel spinal stenosis involving foraminal and lateral stenosis with significant central canal stenosis, compounded with multilevel spondylosis and significant segmental dynamic instability, will require extensive multilevel decompression, including medial facetectomy and multilevel spinal fusion.

### Anatomical and surgical study of volume determination of the anterolateral epidural space nerve root L5/S1 under the aspect of epidural perineural injection in minimal invasive treatment of lumbar nerve root compression [^112axRQo]. European Spine Journal (2011). Low credibility.

The study involved the dissection of twelve human cadaver spines from the cranial level Th12 to the cranial third of the sacral spine. The segments L5/S1 were marked with a needle, and the correct needle position was controlled radiologically in three planes. A radiograph of the complete dissected spine was performed to prove regular anatomical spine structure. Cadavers exhibiting diseases, scoliosis, M. Bechterew, and fracture deformity were excluded from the study.

The topographic anatomy of the nerve roots L5/S1 is illustrated in Fig. 1. The preparation of the L5/S1 area was conducted using a dorsal approach. Soft tissue was meticulously removed until the Ligamentum flavum was reached, and the epidural fat pad was dissected carefully. The vertebral arches were preserved, forming a cavity with the following borders: cranial - the nerve root L5; caudal - the sacral bone; lateral - the complex of the facet; medial - the dural sheath and the S1 root.

- **Fig. 1**: Lumbar spine specimen in a left laterodorsal view after removal of the laminae and the facet joints. The roots L5/S1 and the upper part of the sacral bone form a triangle with the disc in the lower part. Between the pedicles L5 and the sacral bone, the nerve root L5 exits the vertebral foramen L5/S1. The S1 root traverses the disc L5/S1 in its dorsolateral part. The nerve root L5 is situated at the disc level only in the lateral part of the vertebral foramen. The triangle formed by nerve root L5, nerve root S1, and the upper part of the sacral bone creates the anterolateral space L5/S1. This space is prone to issues related to lumbar nerve root compression.

### Decompression alone versus decompression with instrumented fusion in the treatment of lumbar degenerative spondylolisthesis: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised trials [^116SZuHH]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2023). High credibility.

According to the latest recommendations of the North American Spine Society from 2016, based on older observational data, simple decompression may be considered for symptomatic degenerative spondylolisthesis (DS) with low-grade (up to 20% anteroposterior caudal vertebral body) slip unresponsive to conservative treatment. The authors noted that in cases preserving medial structures, results equivalent to those of instrumented decompression can be achieved. Based on the available evidence, it was not possible to make recommendations for, or against supplementing fusion in these patients or to predict the success of surgery in terms of age, comorbidities, duration of symptoms, or body mass index.

In 2020, Sharif et al. published the consensus of the World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies Spine Committee on indications for lumbar spine fusion in DS. They recommended isolated decompression for patients with spinal stenosis without signs of instability and predominant leg pain. Lumbar fusion may be added in patients with unstable symptomatic DS or spinal deformity and in those undergoing bilateral facetectomy of over 50%. Our results support these recommendations, indicating that fusion generally provides no added benefit in DS. However, we could not analyze the outcome according to the level of vertebral slip or instability.

Despite the consensus of professional societies and our findings, survey studies demonstrate significant discrepancies among spine surgeons in the surgical management of DS. For instance, Spina et al. found that 40% of surgeons would always perform fusion in stable DS.

### Higher preoperative Oswestry disability index is associated with better surgical outcome in upper lumbar disc herniations [^114m5Fg2]. European Spine Journal (2008). Low credibility.

To evaluate the surgical outcome in terms of functional and subjective recovery, patients who needed discectomies at the L1-L2, L2-L3, and L3-L4 levels were compared with an age and sex-matched group of patients who required L4-L5 and L5-S1 discectomies. We prospectively enrolled 50 consecutive patients, referred to our center, who had L1-L2, L2-L3, and L3-L4 herniations and required surgical intervention. Likewise, a comparative group of 50 consecutive patients with herniations at L4-L5 and L5-S1 were selected. All 100 patients were treated and followed for a 1-year period.

Physical examination findings as well as the Oswestry Disability Questionnaire before surgery were recorded. After 1 year, patients were requested to fill out the same questionnaire. A significant decline in the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) scores was considered to be a measure of functional improvement and recovery. The mean age of patients with upper lumbar disc herniation (L1-L2, L2-L3, L3-L4) was 45.7 years, and patients with lower lumbar disc herniation (L4-L5, L5-S1) had a mean age of 41.2 years. There was no statistically significant difference in age between the two groups. The preoperative Oswestry Disability Index score had a statistically significant impact on ODI score improvement after surgery in both lower and upper lumbar disc groups. All 100 patients with either lower or upper lumbar disc herniation had a statistically significant ODI change after surgical intervention (P < 0.0001 for both groups). However, patients with upper disc herniations and moderate preoperative disability (ODI of 21–40%).

### Anatomical and surgical study of volume determination of the anterolateral epidural space nerve root L5/S1 under the aspect of epidural perineural injection in minimal invasive treatment of lumbar nerve root compression [^117Gn2yz]. European Spine Journal (2011). Low credibility.

The topographic conditions of the anatomy in the anterolateral epidural space L5/S1 are convenient. An experienced and trained physician can reach this area without the help of image-guided techniques using the two-needle with the epidural–perineural injection technique. The common lumbar spine irritations of the roots L5 and S1 can be treated using small volumes and small means of antiphlogistic substances (one drop only).

The cranial nerve roots (L4 and higher) are not adapted to a dorsal interlaminar approach of the anterolateral epidural space because of a defined transdural passage of the needle. These infrequent nerve root compression syndromes are treated with transforaminal techniques.

We recommend the improvement of the learning curve of the technical procedures in cadaver workshops using an image intensifier. The described technique using the 29-gauge needle is not painful for the patient, needs no radiological support, and requires only small drug amounts to anesthetize the nerve root and perform an antiphlogistic effect.

### Lumbar discectomy outcomes vary by herniation level in the Spine Patient Outcomes Research Trial [^114fWWAQ]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery. American Volume (2008). Low credibility.

The Spine Patient Outcomes Research Trial demonstrated an overall advantage of operative over nonoperative treatment for lumbar disc herniations. Notably, a recent randomized trial showed no benefit for operative treatment at the lumbosacral junction (L5-S1). This prompted a review of subgroups in the Spine Patient Outcomes Research Trial to assess the effect of herniation level on outcomes of both operative and nonoperative care.

- **Methods**: The combined randomized and observation cohorts of the Spine Patient Outcomes Research Trial were analyzed based on the actual treatment received and stratified by the level of disc herniation. A total of 646 L5-S1 herniations, 456 L4-L5 herniations, and 88 upper lumbar (L2-L3 or L3-L4) herniations were evaluated. The primary outcome measures included the Short Form-36 bodily pain and physical functioning scales, along with the modified Oswestry Disability Index, assessed at six weeks, three months, six months, one year, and two years. Treatment effects, defined as the improvement in the operative group minus the improvement in the nonoperative group, were estimated using longitudinal regression models, adjusting for important covariates.

- **Results**: At two years, patients with upper lumbar herniations (L2-L3 or L3-L4) exhibited a significantly greater treatment effect from surgery compared to patients with L5-S1 herniations across all outcome measures: 24.6 and 7.1 for bodily pain (p = 0.002); 23.4 and 9.9 for Short Form-36 physical functioning (p = 0.014); and -19 and -10.3 for the Oswestry Disability Index (p = 0.033). There was a trend toward greater treatment effects in patients with upper lumbar herniations.

### What are long-term predictors of outcomes for lumbar disc herniation? A randomized and observational study [^117H3Gip]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2015). Low credibility.

Although previous studies have illustrated improvements in surgical cohorts for patients with intervertebral disc herniation, there are limited data on predictors of long-term outcomes comparing surgical and nonsurgical outcomes.

- **Questions/purposes**: We assessed outcomes of operative and nonoperative treatment for patients with intervertebral disc herniation and symptomatic radiculopathy at 8 years from the Spine Patient Outcomes Research Trial. We specifically examined subgroups to determine whether certain populations had a better long-term outcome with surgery or nonoperative treatment.

- **Methods**: Patients with symptomatic lumbar radiculopathy for at least 6 weeks associated with nerve root irritation or neurologic deficit on examination and a confirmed disc herniation on cross-sectional imaging were enrolled at 13 different clinical sites. Patients consenting to participate in the randomized cohort were assigned to surgical or nonoperative treatment using variable permuted block randomization stratified by site. Those who declined randomization entered the observational cohort group based on treatment preference but were otherwise treated and followed identically to the randomized cohort. Of those in the randomized cohort, 309 of 501 (62%) provided 8-year data, and in the observational group, 469 of 743 (63%). Patients were treated with either surgical discectomy or usual nonoperative care. By 8 years, only 148 of 245 (60%) of those randomized to surgery had undergone surgery, whereas 122 of 256 (48%) of those randomized to nonoperative treatment had undergone…

### Treatment options for prostate cancer: Evaluating the evidence [^115Bvhjo]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Controversy surrounds the management options for localized prostate cancer, including conservative management, prostatectomy, and radiation. Choosing among these options is difficult due to long-term side effects that include sexual, urinary, and bowel dysfunction. Some recent studies suggest that patients who choose treatment, such as radical prostatectomy or radiation, have longer disease-free survival compared to those who opt for conservative management, like watchful waiting.

However, several biases may artificially enhance the perceived value of treatment and make the interpretation of studies on treatment outcomes difficult. Sources of bias include lead time, length time, and patient selection. Because of the uncertain efficacy of management options and the risk of long-term treatment complications, family physicians need to engage their patients in the decision-making process.

### Is that lumbar disc symptomatic? Herniated lumbar disc associated with contralateral radiculopathy [^114pJtVH]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Low credibility.

A herniated lumbar disc may be asymptomatic or associated with lower limb radiculopathy. Most spinal surgeons would offer surgery following a period of conservative measures if the radiological and clinical findings correlate. However, the existing dictum that lumbar radiculopathy should correlate with ipsilateral lumbar disc herniation may not be accurate, as it can rarely present with contralateral sciatica. Literature regarding this phenomenon is scarce. Therefore, we report a patient with a herniated lumbar disc presenting with predominantly contralateral motor weakness radiculopathy, which resolved after discectomy.

### Surgery versus conservative care for persistent sciatica lasting 4 to 12 months [^111CPR4z]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2020). High credibility.

The treatment of chronic sciatica caused by herniation of a lumbar disk has not been well-studied in comparison with acute disk herniation. Data are needed on whether diskectomy or a conservative approach is better for sciatica that has persisted for several months.

- **Methods**: In a single-center trial, we randomly assigned patients with sciatica that had lasted for 4 to 12 months and lumbar disk herniation at the L4-L5 or L5-S1 level in a 1:1 ratio to undergo microdiskectomy or to receive 6 months of standardized nonoperative care, followed by surgery if needed. Surgery was performed by spine surgeons who used conventional microdiskectomy techniques. The primary outcome was the intensity of leg pain on a visual analogue scale (ranging from 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating more severe pain) at 6 months after enrollment. Secondary outcomes were the score on the Oswestry Disability Index, back and leg pain, and quality-of-life scores at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year.

- **Results**: From 2010 through 2016, a total of 790 patients were screened; of those patients, 128 were enrolled, with 64 in each group. Among the patients assigned to undergo surgery, the median time from randomization to surgery was 3.1 weeks; of the 64 patients in the nonsurgical group, 22 (34%) crossed over to undergo surgery at a median of 11 months after enrollment. At baseline, the mean score for leg-pain intensity was 7.7 in the surgical group and 8.0 in the nonsurgical group. The primary outcome of the leg-pain intensity score at 6 months was 2.8 in the surgical group and 5.2 in the nonsurgical group.

### Musculoskeletal mimics of lumbosacral radiculopathy [^111hJa24]. Muscle & Nerve (2025). Low credibility.

Musculoskeletal disorders are common in patients referred to electrodiagnostic medicine specialists. Not all pain that radiates to the buttock, thigh, leg, or foot arises from compression of one or more lumbosacral spinal nerve roots. Recognition of musculoskeletal disorders that may mimic radiculopathy is important to avoid unnecessary diagnostic testing, potentially inappropriate invasive procedures, and to improve patient care and satisfaction.

### Conservative management for lumbar radiculopathy based on the stage of the disorder: a Delphi study [^113bh6P7]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2023). Low credibility.

The conservative management of lumbar radiculopathy is the first treatment option. At the time of writing, systematic reviews and clinical practice guidelines have not considered the most appropriate timing of management. This study aimed to establish consensus on effective conservative treatment modalities across different stages (i.e. acute, sub-acute, or chronic) of lumbar radiculopathy.

Materials and methods: Through an iterative multistage Delphi process, experts rated agreement with proposed treatment modalities across stages of lumbar radiculopathy and could suggest additional treatment modalities. The agreement was measured using a 5-point Likert scale. Descriptive statistics were used to measure agreement (median, interquartile ranges, and percentage of agreement). Consensus criteria were defined a priori for each round.

- **Results**: Fourteen panelists produced a consensus list of effective treatment modalities across stages of lumbar radiculopathy. Acute stage management should focus on providing patients with information about the condition, including pain education, individualized physical activity, and directional preference exercises, supported with NSAIDs. In the sub-acute stage, strength training and neurodynamic mobilization could be added, and transforaminal/epidural injections considered. In the chronic stage, spinal manipulative therapy, specific exercise, and function-specific physical training should be combined with individualized vocational, ergonomic, and postural advice.

- **Conclusions**: Experts agree the effectiveness of interventions differs through the evolution of lumbar radiculopathy.

### Clinical evaluation and surgical decision making for patients with lumbar discogenic pain and facet syndrome [^1131AqJ6]. European Journal of Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

In industrialized countries, more than two-thirds of the population suffers from low back pain (LBP) in their lifetime. LBP associated with lumbar disc herniation, stenosis, and instability is a well-known and documented entity. On the other hand, lumbar discogenic pain and facet syndrome are difficult to clearly identify and are not always detectable by imaging. This article describes the causes of these painful syndromes, which are typically without a radicular component, explains the modern diagnostic procedures, and provides guidelines for surgical decision making.

### Therapeutic approaches for the no-option refractory angina patient [^111jbsvw]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Interventions (2021). Low credibility.

The combination of an aging population and improved survival rates among patients with coronary artery disease has resulted in an increase in the number of patients with refractory angina or anginal equivalent symptoms despite maximal medical therapy. Patients with refractory angina are often referred to the cardiac catheterization laboratory; however, they have often exhausted conventional revascularization options; thus, this population is often deemed as having "no options".

We review the definition, prevalence, outcomes, therapeutic options, and treatment considerations for no-option refractory angina patients and focus on novel therapies for this complex and challenging population. We propose a multidisciplinary team approach for the evaluation and management of patients with refractory angina, ideally in a designated clinic. The severe limitations and symptomatology experienced by these patients highlight the need for additional research into the development of innovative treatments.

### Incidence of and risk factors for lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy in adults: A systematic review [^114Pz3TU]. European Spine Journal (2025). Low credibility.

Lumbar disc herniation (LDH) with radiculopathy is associated with greater pain, disability, healthcare use, and costs compared with nonspecific low back pain. Reliable information about its incidence and risk factors was lacking.

- **Questions**: (1) What is the incidence of lumbar disc herniation (LDH) with radiculopathy in adults? (2) What are the risk factors for LDH with radiculopathy in adults?

- **Methods**: A systematic review was conducted. Five electronic databases were searched from 1970 to September 2023. Eligible cohort and case–control studies were identified and independently assessed for the risk of bias. A qualitative best evidence synthesis of low and moderate risk of bias studies was conducted.

- **Results**: Eighty-seven studies were critically reviewed, and data were synthesized from 59 (68%) studies; 12 were of low and 47 of moderate risk of bias. The lower and upper bound limits of the 95% CIs of annual incidence estimates ranged from 0.3 to 2.7 per 1,000 persons for surgical case definitions, from 0.04 to 1.5 per 1,000 persons for hospital-based case definitions, and from 0.1 to 298.3 per 1,000 persons for clinical case definitions. Factors associated with the development of LDH with radiculopathy included middle age (30–50 years), smoking, higher BMI, presence of cardiovascular risk factors (in women), and greater cumulative occupational lumbar load by forward bending postures and manual materials handling, with effect sizes ranging from 1.1 (1.0–1.3) to 3.7 (2.3–6.0).

- **Conclusions**: The incidence of LDH varies in different populations and according to case definition.
