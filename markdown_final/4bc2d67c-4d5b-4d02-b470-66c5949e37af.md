## Question

Hemaglobin 7.9 and clots in urine

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about a patient with hemoglobin 7.9 g/dL and clots in the urine, integrating differential diagnosis, stabilization, diagnostics, and management with citations throughout. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate stabilization and transfusion thresholds. Then, I should verify the significance of clots and risk of clot retention. Next, I will construct a prioritized differential diagnosis and outline the initial workup. After that, I need to check imaging and endoscopic priorities, followed by targeted management pathways. Finally, I will consider special populations, follow-up, and a concise decision algorithm, ensuring each step aligns with current guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the clinical severity and stabilization needs. A hemoglobin of 7.9 g/dL in the setting of active gross hematuria with clots constitutes moderate anemia with potential ongoing blood loss; I should not jump to conclusions about stability without assessing vitals, orthostatics, and symptoms, but this level is below restrictive transfusion thresholds in most non-cardiac contexts, so I need to ensure hemodynamic stability and consider transfusion if symptomatic or if bleeding continues, with a typical target of 7–8 g/dL in stable adults and higher in those with cardiovascular disease or ongoing active bleeding, per ACC and BCSH guidance, and the restrictive 7 g/dL threshold supported in UGIB literature as a reasonable analog for bleeding patients without ACS, acknowledging that higher targets may be needed in ACS or massive hemorrhage scenarios [^114e8agN] [^113JjGta] [^1139Yjvs].

> Wait, let me verify the significance of clots in the urine. Clots indicate substantial bleeding and raise concern for clot retention, which can precipitate acute urinary retention and obstructive nephropathy; I should grade severity using the hemorrhagic cystitis scale where clots without obstruction are Grade III and obstruction requiring instrumentation is Grade IV, and I should anticipate the need for urgent urologic intervention if retention occurs, including manual or endoscopic clot evacuation and continuous bladder irrigation, with percutaneous nephroureteral diversion reserved for refractory cases to stabilize renal drainage and reduce transfusion needs [^114M6mR4] [^112wRC3p] [^1173U82T].

> I will now examine the differential diagnosis, but hold on, I should prioritize life-threatening causes first. In adults, painless gross hematuria mandates evaluation for malignancy until proven otherwise, so bladder and upper tract urothelial carcinoma are high on the list; I should also consider stones, infection, and trauma, and I must not overlook coagulopathy or medication effects, including anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents that increase hematuria risk, with warfarin and DOACs variably implicated and antiplatelet agents less often causal but still contributory in some series [^114r1D75] [^115TpSPw] [^115kf7WR].

> Let me think about glomerular versus non-glomerular sources. If I see proteinuria, dysmorphic RBCs, or RBC casts, I should consider glomerulonephritis or other medical renal disease and involve nephrology; otherwise, non-glomerular etiologies such as urothelial malignancy, stones, infection, or vascular lesions are more likely, and the presence of clots strongly favors a lower tract bleeding source like the bladder or prostate rather than pure glomerular bleeding [^116UCChT].

> Next, I should review the initial workup to avoid missing time-sensitive diagnoses. I need a CBC with differential, comprehensive metabolic panel including creatinine and eGFR, PT/INR and aPTT, and a type and screen; I should confirm true hematuria with microscopic urinalysis, assess for proteinuria and RBC morphology, obtain urine culture if infection is suspected, and consider hemolysis labs if tea-colored urine or hemoglobinuria is present, including LDH, haptoglobin, indirect bilirubin, and a peripheral smear, because hemolysis-associated hemoglobin cast nephropathy can mimic or exacerbate hematuria and AKI [^112UvnFL] [^111kLtJd] [^112CtGTu].

> Hold on, I should verify imaging and endoscopic priorities. For gross hematuria, cystoscopy is indicated to visualize the bleeding source in the urethra and bladder, and upper tract imaging with CT urography is preferred to evaluate for stones, masses, or vascular anomalies; ultrasound can be a first-line alternative if contrast is contraindicated or in pregnancy, but I need to ensure that if malignancy is suspected, CT urography is obtained when feasible because of superior sensitivity for upper tract lesions [^113cNqcM] [^1116eVP2].

> I need to ensure I do not overuse adjunctive tests. Urine cytology and urine-based tumor markers should not be used routinely in the initial evaluation of microhematuria and are not substitutes for cystoscopy; they may be considered selectively in intermediate-risk patients who wish to avoid cystoscopy after counseling, but they should not delay definitive visualization when malignancy risk is nontrivial [^111aLfmk] [^112K99jT].

> Let me consider management pathways based on likely etiologies. If malignancy is suspected or found, I should expedite urologic oncology referral for biopsy and stage-appropriate treatment; if stones are identified, urology should guide extraction or lithotripsy; if infection is present, treat and then repeat urinalysis to confirm resolution, proceeding to risk-based urologic evaluation if hematuria persists; if coagulopathy is contributory, coordinate with hematology for reversal or factor replacement as indicated, recognizing that anticoagulant-related hematuria still warrants standard urologic evaluation rather than dismissal [^117Eoaeg] [^114MSbvc] [^1123LifR].

> But wait, what if clot retention occurs. I should double-check for signs of urinary retention and flank pain, and if present, I must act urgently with Foley or suprapubic catheterization, manual or endoscopic clot evacuation, and continuous bladder irrigation; if these fail or bleeding remains intractable, percutaneous nephroureteral tubes can provide diversion and stabilization, and in select refractory cases, intravesical agents such as aminocaproic acid may be considered with caution for fibrinolysis-related bleeding after consulting urology and hematology [^112wRC3p] [^1173U82T] [^notfound].

> I should confirm transfusion strategy and thresholds. In stable, non-cardiac patients without ongoing massive hemorrhage, a restrictive approach targeting hemoglobin around 7–8 g/dL is reasonable, whereas patients with cardiovascular disease, particularly acute coronary syndrome, may benefit from a higher threshold around 8–9 g/dL; in massive hemorrhage or exsanguination, activate a massive transfusion protocol and use goal-directed resuscitation with TEG or ROTEM when available, and monitor ionized calcium and fibrinogen to guide component therapy [^114e8agN] [^1139Yjvs] [^111NtXpR].

> Let me reconsider special populations and contexts. In pregnancy, I should favor ultrasound and MRI without gadolinium for imaging and avoid radiation, while still pursuing cystoscopy if gross hematuria persists; in children, glomerular disease is more common and malignancy less likely, so I should tailor toward nephrology input and avoid unnecessary radiation; in patients with ADPKD, hematuria is often benign but malignancy risk is not zero, so I should maintain vigilance; in patients on antithrombotics, I should not dismiss hematuria and must follow standard risk-based evaluation pathways [^1116eVP2] [^1119aojP] [^112r1Bs5] [^1123LifR].

> Next, I should review follow-up and surveillance. If a risk-based evaluation is negative, shared decision-making about repeating urinalysis is appropriate; if hematuria resolves and later recurs, or if gross hematuria develops, I should re-open evaluation; for low-risk microhematuria, repeating urinalysis in about 6 months is preferred over immediate cystoscopy or imaging, with escalation if persistence is documented [^116tVVqC] [^115LpRp2] [^112njtLh].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought a hemoglobin of 7.9 g/dL might automatically trigger transfusion, but I should correct that. Transfusion decisions should be individualized by symptoms, ongoing bleeding, hemodynamic status, and comorbidities, and in many stable adults without active ischemia, a hemoglobin near 7–8 g/dL is acceptable without transfusion, whereas symptomatic patients or those with cardiovascular disease may warrant earlier transfusion, consistent with restrictive strategies in contemporary bleeding guidelines [^114e8agN] [^113JjGta] [^1139Yjvs].

> To synthesize, I need to ensure a stepwise approach: stabilize and transfuse based on symptoms and comorbidity, assess for clot retention and decompress the bladder if needed, execute a focused workup including labs and urinalysis, obtain cystoscopy and CT urography for gross hematuria, manage the underlying cause with specialty input, and arrange close follow-up with clear return precautions; this sequence balances early control of life-threatening entities like malignancy and clot retention with judicious use of resources and patient-centered risk stratification [^114r1D75] [^113cNqcM] [^114MSbvc].

Hemoglobin 7.9 g/dL with clots in urine indicates **moderate anemia from significant urinary blood loss** and a high risk of clot retention/obstruction [^114M6mR4]. Immediate priorities are to **stabilize hemodynamics**, confirm true hematuria with microscopy [^114yLxJ6], and **evaluate for life-threatening causes** such as malignancy, severe infection, or coagulopathy [^114r1D75]. Management includes transfusion to maintain hemoglobin ≥ 7 g/dL [^114e8agN], bladder irrigation or catheterization for clots [^114M6mR4], and urgent urology consultation for cystoscopy and imaging (CT urography) [^113cNqcM] [^1116eVP2]. Hospitalization is indicated for ongoing bleeding, hemodynamic instability, or inability to secure follow-up [^114r1D75].

## Clinical significance of hemoglobin 7.9 g/dL with clots in urine

- **Severity of anemia**: Hemoglobin 7.9 g/dL represents moderate anemia and reflects significant blood loss or chronic blood loss with impaired red cell production [^notfound].

- **Presence of clots**: Clots in urine indicate substantial bleeding, increasing the risk of urinary tract obstruction, clot retention, and acute urinary retention [^114M6mR4].

- **Potential complications**: Untreated, this can lead to hypovolemic shock, acute kidney injury, and significant morbidity [^notfound].

---

## Differential diagnosis

The differential diagnosis for hematuria with clots and moderate anemia includes:

| **Category** | **Common causes** |
|-|-|
| Malignancy | - Bladder cancer <br/> - Renal cell carcinoma <br/> - Prostate cancer [^115TpSPw] |
| Infectious | - Severe urinary tract infection <br/> - Pyelonephritis <br/> - Prostatitis [^115TpSPw] |
| Inflammatory | - Glomerulonephritis <br/> - Interstitial cystitis [^115TpSPw] |
| Trauma | - Renal trauma <br/> - Bladder injury <br/> - Urethral injury [^115TpSPw] |
| Vascular | - Renal artery aneurysm <br/> - Arteriovenous malformation <br/> - Nutcracker syndrome [^115TpSPw] |
| Coagulopathy | - Anticoagulant use <br/> - Hemophilia <br/> - Thrombocytopenia [^114ezjPA] |
| Stones | - Nephrolithiasis <br/> - Ureteral stones [^115TpSPw] |

## Immediate clinical evaluation

### History and physical examination

History should cover the onset, duration, and severity of hematuria; associated symptoms (pain, fever, dysuria, weight loss); recent trauma or surgery; anticoagulant or antiplatelet use; and personal/family bleeding history [^117YCanz]. Physical examination should assess vital signs and hemodynamic stability; look for pallor, bruising, or petechiae; perform an abdominal exam for masses or tenderness; and conduct a focused genitourinary exam [^117YCanz].

---

### Laboratory investigations

- **Complete blood count (CBC)**: Confirm anemia, assess leukocytosis, platelet count [^116DbepM].

- **Coagulation profile**: PT, aPTT, INR, fibrinogen [^114e8agN].

- **Renal function tests**: Serum creatinine, BUN, eGFR [^117YCanz].

- **Urinalysis**: Confirm true hematuria, assess proteinuria, RBC morphology, presence of casts [^114yLxJ6].

- **Type and crossmatch**: Prepare for potential transfusion [^notfound].

---

### Imaging studies

Imaging should include **renal and bladder ultrasound as an initial modality** to detect stones, masses, or structural abnormalities [^1116eVP2]. Use **CT urography** for detailed evaluation of the upper urinary tract, particularly when malignancy is suspected [^113cNqcM]. Reserve MRI for patients with contraindications to CT or when further soft-tissue detail is needed [^notfound].

---

## Management strategies

### Stabilization and supportive care

- **Hemodynamic stabilization**: Intravenous fluids, transfusion to maintain hemoglobin ≥ 7 g/dL [^114e8agN].

- **Bladder irrigation**: Continuous bladder irrigation (CBI) to prevent clot retention and obstruction [^111Xzcg8].

- **Catheterization**: Three-way Foley catheter for clot evacuation and irrigation [^notfound].

---

### Definitive management

- **Urology consultation**: Cystoscopy for direct visualization and management of bleeding source [^113cNqcM].

- **Endoscopic interventions**: Electrocautery, laser coagulation, or transurethral resection of bleeding lesions [^112wRC3p].

- **Angiographic embolization**: For refractory bleeding from vascular abnormalities [^114HbVmm].

- **Surgical intervention**: Partial or radical nephrectomy, cystectomy, or prostatectomy for malignancy or severe refractory bleeding [^111Xzcg8].

---

### Addressing underlying causes

Treat infections with appropriate antibiotics and manage stones with medical expulsion, **extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy**, or ureteroscopy [^117Eoaeg]. For coagulopathies, correct underlying disorders with factor replacement, **anticoagulant reversal**, or platelet transfusion [^114e8agN]. Malignancy requires oncologic evaluation and management, including surgery, **chemotherapy**, or radiation therapy [^notfound].

---

## Indications for hospitalization

Hospitalization is warranted for **hemodynamic instability** — hypotension, tachycardia, or ongoing bleeding — or for **inability to achieve hemodynamic stability** despite initial resuscitation. Admission is also indicated for suspected or confirmed malignancy requiring urgent intervention, severe infection such as pyelonephritis or prostatitis, coagulopathy needing close monitoring and correction, and inability to secure close outpatient follow-up or reliable care [^notfound].

---

## Prognosis and outcomes

Prognosis depends on the underlying cause, severity of anemia, and timeliness of intervention. With prompt diagnosis and appropriate management, most patients experience **favorable outcomes**; however, delayed treatment can result in significant morbidity and mortality [^114ezjPA].

---

Hemoglobin 7.9 g/dL with clots in urine reflects **significant urinary blood loss** and a high risk of complications. Immediate evaluation, stabilization, and targeted management are essential to prevent morbidity and mortality [^113VR3kr].

### The approach to the patient with hematuria [^114r1D75]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Hematuria is common; whether gross or microscopic, it is incumbent on emergency providers to consider life-threatening and benign processes when evaluating these patients. Most workup is driven by a focused history and physical, including laboratory studies and diagnostic imaging. The cause originates in the genitourinary tract and, as long as the patient remains stable, they can be discharged with close outpatient follow-up. The importance of this cannot be stressed enough because hematuria, especially in the elderly, frequently signals the presence of urologic malignancy. In addition, the workup occasionally yields a nongenitourinary tract cause, and these patients often require emergent management.

### Acquired hemophilia presenting as profound hematuria: evaluation, diagnosis, and management of elusive cause of bleeding in the emergency department setting [^114ezjPA]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

There are numerous causes of bleeding that may present to the Emergency Department (ED). Although rare, acquired hemophilia is a potentially life-threatening bleeding disorder, with reported mortality rates ranging from 6% to 8% among patients who received proper diagnosis and treatment. Approximately two thirds of patients with this condition will present with major bleeding, the magnitude of which may necessitate urgent evaluation and care.

Objectives

The aim of this article is to provide an overview of the evaluation, differential diagnosis, and management of acquired hemophilia for the emergency physician.

Case Report

A case report of a patient who presented to the ED with gross hematuria secondary to undiagnosed acquired hemophilia is described to facilitate a review of the laboratory evaluation, differential diagnosis, and treatment of acquired hemophilia.

Conclusion

Patients with acquired hemophilia-related bleeding may present to the ED for care, given the often serious nature of their bleeding. Delayed diagnosis may postpone the initiation of targeted, effective treatments for achieving hemostasis, with potentially catastrophic consequences, particularly in patients who require emergent invasive procedures. Recognition of the potential for an underlying bleeding disorder and subsequent consultation with a hematologist are critical first steps in effectively identifying and managing a patient with acquired hemophilia who presents with bleeding.

### Hematuria [^116UCChT]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

The emergency physician can expect to commonly evaluate patients with hematuria, and the differential diagnosis will include both benign and life-threatening causes. This differential is divided into the following categories: glomerular or nonglomerular, coagulopathy-related, traumatic, and factitious causes. Nonglomerular causes account for the majority of hematuria evaluated in the ED, with infection and stones being the most prevalent diagnoses. Glomerular causes will have associated red cell casts and proteinuria present on urinalysis. Painless atraumatic gross hematuria in the elderly is caused by a malignancy until proven otherwise. A focused history, physical exam, and appropriate diagnostic testing in the ED usually yields a diagnosis. If the patient is discharged home, proper follow-up with the primary care physician, urologist, or nephrologist is indicated, depending upon the diagnosis.

Objective

The purpose of this article is to describe the current consensus guidelines for nonimaging triage and ultimate preferred imaging approach for the patient with unexplained hematuria.

Conclusion

Numerous consensus guidelines from varying societies have outlined preferred imaging pathways for the patient with unexplained urologic causes of hematuria. Future guidelines will need to take into account disease prevalence, radiation considerations, and cost.

### Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura presenting as bilateral flank pain and hematuria: a case report [^115wXDKv]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a rare disease whose incidence is now increasing. We present a case of a 37-year-old man who presented with bilateral flank pain and hematuria, subsequently diagnosed with TTP. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura has classically been characterized by the pentad of fever, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, neurologic symptoms, renal dysfunction, and thrombocytopenia. The pathogenesis of the disease has been a mystery until recently. We review the current literature regarding the pathophysiology and management of this disorder. Our discussion focuses on the importance of understanding this disease while considering the differential diagnosis of a patient presenting with anemia and thrombocytopenia because the common pitfall of rapidly administering platelets to a patient with TTP may lead to a disastrous outcome.

### Hemolytic anemia: evaluation and differential diagnosis [^111kLtJd]. American Family Physician (2018). Low credibility.

Hemolytic anemia is defined by the premature destruction of red blood cells, and can be chronic or life-threatening. It should be part of the differential diagnosis for any normocytic or macrocytic anemia. Hemolysis may occur intravascularly, extravascularly in the reticuloendothelial system, or both. Mechanisms include poor deformability leading to trapping and phagocytosis, antibody-mediated destruction through phagocytosis or direct complement activation, fragmentation due to microthrombi or direct mechanical trauma, oxidation, or direct cellular destruction. Patients with hemolysis may present with acute anemia, jaundice, hematuria, dyspnea, fatigue, tachycardia, and possibly hypotension. Laboratory test results that confirm hemolysis include reticulocytosis, as well as increased lactate dehydrogenase, increased unconjugated bilirubin, and decreased haptoglobin levels. The direct antiglobulin test further differentiates immune causes from nonimmune causes. A peripheral blood smear should be performed when hemolysis is present to identify abnormal red blood cell morphologies. Hemolytic diseases are classified into hemoglobinopathies, membranopathies, enzymopathies, immune-mediated anemias, and extrinsic nonimmune causes. Extrinsic nonimmune causes include the thrombotic microangiopathies, direct trauma, infections, systemic diseases, and oxidative insults. Medications can cause hemolytic anemia through several mechanisms. A rapid onset of anemia or significant hyperbilirubinemia in the neonatal period should prompt consideration of a hemolytic anemia.

### Asymptomatic microscopic hematuria in adults: summary of the AUA best practice policy recommendations [^115sJyBv]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

The American Urological Association (AUA) convened the Best Practice Policy Panel on Asymptomatic Microscopic Hematuria to formulate policy statements and recommendations for the evaluation of asymptomatic microhematuria in adults. The recommended definition of microscopic hematuria is three or more red blood cells per high-power microscopic field in urinary sediment from two of three properly collected urinalysis specimens. This definition accounts for some degree of hematuria in normal patients, as well as the intermittent nature of hematuria in patients with urologic malignancies. Asymptomatic microscopic hematuria has causes ranging from minor findings that do not require treatment to highly significant, life-threatening lesions. Therefore, the AUA recommends that an appropriate renal or urologic evaluation be performed in all patients with asymptomatic microscopic hematuria who are at risk for urologic disease or primary renal disease. At this time, there is no consensus on when to test for microscopic hematuria in the primary care setting, and screening is not addressed in this report. However, the AUA report suggests that the patient's history and physical examination should help the physician decide whether testing is appropriate.

### Acetohydroxamic acid (Lithostat) [^117UUECC]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

WHAT IS LITHOSTAT? LITHOSTAT®is a drug which prevents the excessive buildup of ammonia in your urine, which controls the acidity and alkalinity (pH) of your urine. The cause of excessive ammonia and alkalinity in your urine is a bacterial infection.

WHAT CAN LITHOSTAT DO? Treatment with LITHOSTAT®is prescribed to decrease urinary ammonia. This may increase the chance of controlling your infection with antibiotics and may help the treatment of your kidney stones. Dissolution of existing stones is unlikely.

LITHOSTAT®should not be used in place of surgical treatment. Surgical removal of all stones and elimination of all infection with antibiotics offers the possibility of curative treatment. LITHOSTAT®is likely to be more effective after large stones or obstructing stones have been removed.

WHAT ARE THE PROBLEMS OR SIDE EFFECTS WITH LITHOSTAT? The complete spectrum of side effects induced by LITHOSTAT®(acetohydroxamic acid) is unknown. However, some side effects which have been reported to date have been headaches, abdominal discomfort, nausea, loss of hair, shakiness, and anemia. Lifethreatening problems (blood clot in the legs) occurred in several patients with advanced disease in early investigation. In more extensive later investigations, this problem has not occurred. No patient has died as a consequence of taking LITHOSTAT®. The most serious side effects seem to occur in patients with poor kidney function and/or in patients with a previous history of these conditions.

### Assessment of microscopic hematuria in adults [^115UnMZX]. American Family Physician (2006). Low credibility.

Microscopic hematuria, a common finding on routine urinalysis of adults, is clinically significant when three to five red blood cells per high-power field are visible. Etiologies of microscopic hematuria range from incidental causes to life-threatening urinary tract neoplasm. The lack of evidence-based imaging guidelines can complicate the family physician's decision about the best way to proceed. Patients with proteinuria, red cell casts, and elevated serum creatinine levels should be referred promptly to a nephrology subspecialist. Microscopic hematuria with signs of urinary tract infection should resolve with appropriate treatment of the underlying infection. Patients with asymptomatic microscopic hematuria or with hematuria persisting after treatment of urinary tract infection also need to be evaluated. Because upper and lower urinary tract pathologies often coexist, patients should be evaluated using cytology plus intravenous urography, computed tomography, or ultrasonography. When urine cytology results are abnormal, cystoscopy should be performed to complete the investigation.

### Hematuria as a marker of occult urinary tract cancer: advice for high-value care from the American College of Physicians [^113VR3kr]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The presence of blood in the urine, or hematuria, is a common finding in clinical practice and can sometimes be a sign of occult cancer. This article describes the clinical epidemiology of hematuria and the current state of practice and science in this context and provides suggestions for clinicians evaluating patients with hematuria.

Methods

A narrative review of available clinical guidelines and other relevant studies on the evaluation of hematuria was conducted, with particular emphasis on considerations for urologic referral.

High-Value Care Advice 1

Clinicians should include gross hematuria in their routine review of systems and specifically ask all patients with microscopic hematuria about any history of gross hematuria.

High-Value Care Advice 2

Clinicians should not use screening urinalysis for cancer detection in asymptomatic adults.

High-Value Care Advice 3

Clinicians should confirm heme-positive results of dipstick testing with microscopic urinalysis that demonstrates 3 or more erythrocytes per high-powered field before initiating further evaluation in all asymptomatic adults.

High-Value Care Advice 4

Clinicians should refer for further urologic evaluation in all adults with gross hematuria, even if self-limited.

High-Value Care Advice 5

Clinicians should consider urology referral for cystoscopy and imaging in adults with microscopically confirmed hematuria in the absence of some demonstrable benign cause.

High-Value Care Advice 6

Clinicians should pursue evaluation of hematuria even if the patient is receiving antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy.

High-Value Care Advice 7

Clinicians should not obtain urinary cytology or other urine-based molecular markers for bladder cancer detection in the initial evaluation of hematuria.

### Updates to microhematuria: AUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^114MSbvc]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Microhematuria initial evaluation — in patients with microhematuria, clinicians should perform a history, physical examination including blood pressure measurement, and serum creatinine to assess risk factors for genitourinary malignancy, medical renal disease, gynecologic, and non-malignant genitourinary causes of microhematuria; clinicians should perform the same evaluation of patients with microhematuria who are taking antiplatelet agents or anticoagulants (regardless of the type or level of therapy) as patients not on these agents; in patients with findings suggestive of a gynecologic or non-malignant urologic etiology, clinicians should evaluate the patients with appropriate physical examination techniques and tests to identify such an etiology; in patients diagnosed with gynecologic or non-malignant genitourinary sources of microhematuria, clinicians should repeat urinalysis following resolution of the gynecologic or non-malignant genitourinary cause, and if microhematuria persists or the etiology cannot be identified, clinicians should perform risk-based urologic evaluation; in patients with hematuria attributed to a urinary tract infection, clinicians should obtain a urinalysis with microscopic evaluation following treatment to ensure resolution of the hematuria; and clinicians should refer patients with microhematuria for nephrological evaluation if medical renal disease is suspected. However, risk-based urologic evaluation should still be performed.

### Severe hematuria in a patient receiving bevacizumab and pembrolizumab for metastatic cervical cancer: a case report [^112CM9ud]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Bevacizumab is a monoclonal antibody drug targeting Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF), which binds to VEGF receptors to inhibit vascular endothelial cell proliferation and angiogenesis, thus inhibiting tumorigenesis. Pembrolizumab is a monoclonal antibody that can bind to the programmed death-1 (PD-1) receptor, which can block the binding of the PD-1 receptor to its ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2, and release PD-1 pathway-mediated suppression of immune responses. By blocking the activity of PD-1, the purpose of inhibiting tumor growth is achieved.

Case Presentation

We report a severe hematuria of bevacizumab plus pembrolizumab, in a 58-year-old woman with metastatic cervical cancer. After three cycles every three weeks of consolidation chemotherapy (carboplatin, paclitaxel, bevacizumab) and following three cycles consolidation chemotherapy (carboplatin, paclitaxel, bevacizumab, pembrolizumab), the patient presented a worsening state. Manifested as massive gross hematuria with blood clots. After stopping chemotherapy, cefoxitin, tranexamic acid and hemocoagulase atrox therapy was administered resulting in rapid clinical improvement. The patient was a cervical cancer with bladder metastasis that increases the risk of development of hematuria. Inhibition of VEGF, which has anti-apoptotic, anti-inflammatory, and pro-survival influences on endothelial cells, weakens their regenerative capacity and increases expression of proinflammatory genes leading to weakened supporting layers of blood vessels and, hence, to damaged vascular integrity. In our patient, the development of hematuria may result from the anti-VEGF effect of bevacizumab. In addition, pembrolizumab may also cause bleeding, and the mechanism of bleeding caused by pembrolizumab is currently unclear, which may be related to immune mediation.

Conclusion

To our knowledge, this is the first case reporting on the development of severe hematuria during bevacizumab plus pembrolizumab treatment, which should alert the clinicians in case of bleeding adverse events onset in older patients under bevacizumab plus pembrolizumab therapy.

### Hemolysis-associated hemoglobin cast nephropathy results from a range of clinicopathologic disorders [^112CtGTu]. Kidney International (2019). Medium credibility.

Intravascular hemolysis is relatively rare but can lead to acute kidney injury (AKI), from increased destruction of erythrocytes and release of free hemoglobin. Since hemolysis and hemoglobinuria are known causes of acute kidney injury we sought to define clinicopathologic findings and outcomes of patients with hemolysis-associated hemoglobin cast nephropathy through a retrospective analysis of 27 cases. The mean patient age was 47 years (range 19–79) and the female-to-male ratio was 1.3:1. All patients presented with AKI with a mean serum creatinine of 8.0 (range 2.9–17.0) mg/dL. Etiologies included autoimmune hemolytic anemia (30%), medication (26%), paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (7%), procedural/mechanical causes (7%), transfusion of incompatible blood (4%), toxin ingestion (4%), disseminated intravascular coagulation (4%), and hemoglobinopathy (4%). All biopsies showed acute tubular injury and pigmented, proteinaceous casts characterized by positive hemoglobin immunohistochemistry. After a mean follow-up of nine months (range 0.5–26), the mean serum creatinine was 1.3 (range 0.6–3.3) mg/dL, with 78% of patients returning to normal kidney function. Thus, based on our clinicopathologic case series, hemolysis-associated hemoglobin cast nephropathy is an important entity for clinicians and pathologists to recognize as treatment hinges upon elimination of the pathogenic driver of intravascular hemolysis.

### HFSA / SAEM / ISHLT clinical expert consensus document on the emergency management of patients with ventricular assist devices [^115jXdWo]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2019). High credibility.

Pump thrombosis in ventricular assist device patients — recognition and initial management are summarized as follows: Suspect pump thrombosis with lasting increases in pump power by > 50% accompanied by elevated, inaccurate flow estimates, and hemolysis manifested as an LDH elevation, and note that hemolysis may present as hemoglobinuria with dark, "tea-colored" or frankly bloody urine, and urinalysis may be positive for blood without red blood cells. Hemolysis may be detected by elevations in serum LDH (> 600 mg/dl or 2.5 times baseline depending on the assay used) and elevated free hemoglobin (> 40 mg/dl), with additional markers including increased total and indirect bilirubin or reduced haptoglobin levels, and non-occlusive thrombi can result in significant hemolysis in the absence of hemodynamic instability. When pump thrombosis is suspected or diagnosed, patients should be transported as soon as possible to the nearest VAD center where pump exchange or lysis can be performed if urgently required; proper management begins with hospitalization and systemic anti-coagulation, usually with unfractionated heparin or a direct thrombin inhibitor, and admission to an intensive care unit with inotropic support and diuretic therapy may be appropriate during a period of watchful waiting to determine if the situation reverses.

Haematuria can be a troublesome symptom with various different methods of presentation and aetiologies. Microscopic haematuria is a common coincidental finding often found when the patient has presented for another reason. We will discuss the subject of haematuria but will focus the majority of this article on the discussion of microscopic haematuria, including a definition, the important features to cover in the history and examination, aetiologies to suspect in children and infants, and a suggested approach to assessing these patients in secondary care.

### Updates to microhematuria: AUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^114yLxJ6]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Microhematuria — dipstick versus microscopy: Clinicians should not define microhematuria by positive dipstick testing alone, and a positive urine dipstick test (trace blood or greater) should prompt formal microscopic evaluation of the urine; this is a Strong Recommendation with Evidence Level: Grade C. The Panel emphasizes that a positive dipstick merits microscopic examination of the urinary sediment but does not warrant full evaluation unless microscopic evaluation confirms ≥ 3 RBC/HPF, and if suspicion persists, repeat microscopic testing may be reasonable after assessing patient risk and preference. Supporting data note that in a series of 237 female patients with a positive dipstick, 20.3% had a normal urinalysis, and amongst 54 patients referred for microhematuria evaluations based solely on a positive dipstick, only 14 (26%) had a positive urinalysis result.

### Incidence of visible hematuria among antithrombotic agents: a systematic review of over 175, 000 patients [^115kf7WR]. Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the probability of visible hematuria with antithrombotic agents and to evaluate association of urologic etiology in antithrombotic-related hematuria.

Methods

Preferred Reporting Items in Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines were followed to conduct a systematic review using search engines PUBMED and SCOPUS with the terms "(hematuria) OR (haematuria) OR urinary bleeding)) AND ((anticoagulants) OR anticoagulation) OR noac) OR novel anticoagulants) OR antiplatelet) OR dabigatran) OR rivaroxaban) OR apixaban) OR warfarin) OR aspirin) OR heparin) OR dipyridamole)". Raw data were used to perform a pooled analysis. Chi-square and logistic regression analysis were used for statistical analyses.

Results

Twenty-two studies describing 175,114 patients met inclusion criteria. Odds ratio of hematuria with warfarin to rivoraxaban was 33 and warfarin to dabigatran was 16. The odds ratio of hematuria for oral anticoagulant (26.7%) to prophylactic parenteral anticoagulant (1.1%) agents was 9.6. Antiplatelet agents are 76 times less likely to cause hematuria compared to anticoagulants. Odds of hematuria with aspirin were 6.7 times the odds with clopidogrel and 3.5 times the odds with ticagrelor. Dabigatran was 198 times more likely to cause major hematuria compared to warfarin, whereas clopidogrel is 1.2 times more likely to cause major hematuria compared to aspirin. Urologic pathology was identified in 44% (234/532) of cases, malignancy in 24%.

Conclusion

Warfarin use poses the greatest risk for hematuria but is unlikely to cause major hematuria, whereas novel antithrombotic agents are more commonly associated with major hematuria. This review further characterizes the risk profile of antithrombotic agents and associated hematuria to equip clinicians with knowledge to choose an appropriate antithrombotic agent in patients with high-risk hematuria.

Microhematuria — diagnostic evaluation context: Most experts agree that patients with gross hematuria (GH) should be evaluated with cystoscopy, upper tract imaging and urinary cytology, but variability exists across guidelines regarding microhematuria. The 2012 AUA Guideline recommended computed tomography (CT) urography and cystoscopy in all patients over 35 years of age with microhematuria and was crafted without regard to an individual patients' risk of malignancy, and its principal goal was to minimize the likelihood of missing a malignancy diagnosis.

### ACG clinical guideline: upper gastrointestinal and ulcer bleeding [^1139Yjvs]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Red blood cell transfusion in upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) — we suggest a restrictive policy of red blood cell (RBC) transfusion with a threshold for transfusion at a hemoglobin of 7 g/dL for patients with UGIB (conditional recommendation, low-quality evidence). A threshold of 7 g/dL was chosen because the randomized controlled trial (RCT) demonstrating benefit of restrictive transfusion in UGIB used 7 g/dL, and a meta-analysis found no significant mortality difference between trials using a restrictive threshold of 8–9 g/dL (RR = 1.05, 0.78–1.40) and those using 7 g/dL (RR = 0.94, 0.74–1.19). Given the exclusion of exsanguinating UGIB from these RCTs, the panel agreed it is reasonable to transfuse in hypotensive patients before hemoglobin reaches 7 g/dL. A threshold of 8 g/dL is reasonable in patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease; this population must be differentiated from those who present with acute coronary syndrome, in whom a threshold higher than 7 g/dL may be considered, based on very limited evidence. Conclusion notes that a restrictive RBC transfusion policy with a threshold of 7 g/dL seems to reduce further bleeding and death.

Bleeding resuscitation and transfusion thresholds — initial measures and targets: Aggressive volume resuscitation using intravenous isotonic crystalloids such as 0.9% NaCl or Ringer's lactate is recommended, and patients with symptomatic anemia or active bleeding should receive RBC transfusions to maintain a hemoglobin ≥ 7 g/dL; in underlying coronary artery disease, particularly acute coronary syndromes, guidelines recommend a target hemoglobin ≥ 8 g/dL. Platelets should be transfused to maintain a platelet count ≥ 50 × 10⁹/L and cryoprecipitate to maintain a fibrinogen > 100 mg/dL. For patients requiring ≥ 3 units of packed RBCs within 1 hour, activation of a massive transfusion protocol should be considered; protocols vary and many centers use goal-directed transfusion with TEG or ROTEM. Ionized calcium levels should be monitored; if abnormal, administration of calcium is indicated. Early administration of tranexamic acid for trauma patients within the first 3 hours is associated with decreased bleeding and overall mortality and should be considered, and the writing committee recommends further resuscitation using a goal-directed strategy guided by laboratory results.

### Hematuria in children [^112iqPgs]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Children with hematuria require a thorough history and physical examination. Not all children with hematuria require the same investigations. The only laboratory test uniformly required for children with the various presentations of hematuria is a complete urinalysis with a microscopic examination. The rest of the evaluation is tailored according to the pertinent history, physical examination, and other abnormalities on the urinalysis. This article has provided a brief summary of the more common causes of pediatric hematuria and suggestions for tailoring the patient's evaluation according to the presentation. Most causes of hematuria in pediatrics represent medical conditions that often require referral to a pediatric nephrologist. Indications for referral to a urologist are more limited and include stones that do not pass spontaneously or are more than 5 mm in diameter, renal injury from trauma, anatomic abnormalities, or gross hematuria that seems to originate from the urinary tract and is without an identified cause.

Microhematuria — follow-up after negative evaluation: In patients with a negative risk-based hematuria evaluation, clinicians should engage in shared decision-making regarding whether to repeat urinalysis in the future (Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C). For patients with a prior negative hematuria evaluation and subsequent negative urinalysis, clinicians may discontinue further evaluation for microhematuria (Conditional Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C). For patients with a prior negative hematuria evaluation who have persistent or recurrent microhematuria at the time of repeat urinalysis, clinicians should engage in shared decision-making regarding the need for additional evaluation (Expert Opinion). For patients with a prior negative hematuria evaluation who develop gross hematuria, significant increase in degree of microhematuria, or new urologic symptoms, clinicians should initiate further evaluation (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C).

Cases of hemolytic anemia in patients treated with hydroxyurea for myeloproliferative diseases have been reported [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Patients who develop acute jaundice or hematuria in the presence of persistent or worsening of anemia should have laboratory tests evaluated for hemolysis (e.g., measurement of serum lactate dehydrogenase, haptoglobin, reticulocyte, unconjugated bilirubin levels, urinalysis, and direct and indirect antiglobulin [Coombs] tests). In the setting of confirmed diagnosis of hemolytic anemia not related to the disease and in the absence of other causes, discontinue SIKLOS.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® hematuria [^1116eVP2]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Hematuria is a common reason for patients to be referred for imaging of the urinary tract. All patients diagnosed with hematuria should undergo a thorough history and physical examination, urinalysis, and serologic testing prior to any initial imaging. Ultrasound, CT, and MRI are the most common imaging modalities used to evaluate hematuria. This document discusses the following clinical scenarios for hematuria: initial imaging of microhematuria without risk factors or history of recent vigorous exercise, or presence of infection, or viral illness, or present or recent menstruation; initial imaging of microhematuria in patients with known risk factors and no history of recent vigorous exercise, or presence of infection, or viral illness, or present or recent menstruation or renal parenchymal disease; initial imaging of microhematuria in the pregnant patient and initial imaging of gross hematuria. Follow-up of normal or abnormal findings is beyond the scope of this review. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Nutcracker syndrome and sickle cell trait: a perfect storm for hematuria [^116sXsgp]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

We describe the case of a 27-year-old woman with a history of sickle cell trait (SCT) who presented with several months of hematuria and was found to have nutcracker syndrome (NCS). While SCT is a common cause of hematuria resulting from renal papillary necrosis, our patient had concomitant abdominal pain and anemia, prompting further evaluation and the subsequent diagnosis of NCS. Interestingly, the anoxia in the left renal vein from NCS predisposes patients with SCT to sickling. Our case highlights key clinical features of both NCS and SCT and the relationship between the two disease processes.

### Evaluation of gross hematuria [^114qg7k6]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

Gross hematuria in children is a common complaint that often leads patients to seek urgent care. The diagnostic evaluation can be chosen based on specific patient history and physical examination. When a patient is asymptomatic, hypercalciuria and mild forms of glomerulonephritis are common causes of gross hematuria. Although they are less common in children, special care should be taken to investigate for renal and bladder tumors.

### Red-colored urine in the cardiac surgical patient-diagnosis, causes, and management [^111UDbqk]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2021). Medium credibility.

Red-colored urine occurring in the intraoperative and early postoperative periods after cardiac surgery is often a cause for concern. This observation may be a result of hematuria from pathology within the urinary tract, anticoagulant-related nephropathy, drug-induced acute interstitial nephropathy, excretion of heme pigment-containing proteins, such as myoglobin and hemoglobin, and hemolysis occurring during extracorporeal circulation. Within the kidneys, heme-containing compounds result in pigment nephropathy, which is a significant contributory factor to cardiac surgery-associated acute kidney injury. Concerted efforts to reduce red blood cell damage during cardiopulmonary bypass, together with early recognition of the at-risk patient and the institution of prompt therapeutic intervention, may improve outcomes. This review addresses the diagnosis, causes, and management of red-discolored urine occurring during and after cardiac surgery.

### Evaluation of asymptomatic, atraumatic hematuria in children and adults [^111W429b]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2010). Medium credibility.

Asymptomatic, atraumatic hematuria is a worrisome clinical sign for a patient that usually prompts a visit to a urologist. Hematuria is classified as microscopic versus gross; the evaluation for gross hematuria differs from that for microscopic hematuria, and the most important differentiating factor is the patient's age. The major causes of hematuria differ between children and adults, and the evaluation should reflect this. Renal disease is more common in children and malignancy more common in adults. The application and utility of laboratory tests, radiological studies, and cystoscopy are well established in adults but are more variable in children. Follow-up of hematuria after a negative evaluation is becoming more limited in adults but should be routine for children.

Microhematuria: AUA/SUFU Guideline (2020, Amended 2025) — purpose and methodology are outlined as follows: The purpose of this guideline is to provide a clinical framework for the diagnosis, evaluation, and follow-up of microhematuria (MH). OVID was used to systematically search MEDLINE and EMBASE databases for articles evaluating hematuria using criteria determined by the expert panel; the initial draft evidence report included evidence published from January 2010 through February 2019, and a second search included studies published up to December 2019. Five systematic reviews and 91 primary literature studies met the study selection criteria and were chosen to form the evidence base. When sufficient evidence existed, the body of evidence for a particular modality was assigned a strength rating of A (high), B (moderate), or C (low); and evidence-based statements of Strong, Moderate, or Conditional Recommendation were developed, with additional information provided as Clinical Principles and Expert Opinions when insufficient evidence exists. In 2024, this Guideline was reviewed via the AUA update literature review (ULR) process, which identified 82 studies for full-text review that were published between December 2019 and June 7, 2024; of those 82 studies, 23 met inclusion criteria for qualitative synthesis, and the subsequent amendment is based on data released since the initial 2020 publication of this Guideline.

### Guidelines for the diagnosis, prevention and management of chemical-and radiation-induced cystitis [^114M6mR4]. Journal of Clinical Urology (2014). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "Grading of hemorrhagic cystitis" for chemical- and radiation-induced hemorrhagic cystitis and BK polyomavirus-associated hemorrhagic cystitis.

The grading system for hemorrhagic cystitis is a clinical tool designed to categorize the severity of this condition based on urine findings. The primary purpose of this grading system is to facilitate standardized communication among clinicians about the patient's condition, guide treatment decisions, and provide a basis for prognostic considerations.

The grading system is based on four primary components, each corresponding to a specific grade of severity. Grade I is assigned when non-visible hematuria is present. Grade II is designated for cases with macroscopic hematuria. The presence of macroscopic hematuria with small clots elevates the condition to Grade III. The most severe form, Grade IV, is characterized by gross hematuria with clots causing urinary tract obstruction that requires instrumentation for clot evacuation.

The result is determined by the most severe symptom present, with each grade representing an escalating level of severity. This grading system provides a clear, concise method for assessing the severity of hemorrhagic cystitis, aiding in the management and treatment of the condition.

This tool evaluates the severity of hemorrhagic cystitis based on urine findings, determining one of four possible grades. By selecting the description that best matches the urine's appearance, the tool categorizes the condition as follows:

- **Non-visible hematuria** indicates Grade I, representing the mildest form of the condition without visible blood in the urine.
- **Macroscopic hematuria** corresponds to Grade II, where blood is visibly present in the urine.
- **Macroscopic hematuria with small clots** is classified as Grade III, showing noticeable clots along with visible blood.
- **Gross hematuria with clots causing urinary tract obstruction requiring instrumentation for clot evacuation** is assigned Grade IV. This represents the most severe form, where clots have accumulated to the point of blocking urine flow, necessitating medical intervention to clear the obstruction.

Understanding these grades helps in recognizing the severity and potential complications associated with hemorrhagic cystitis, guiding appropriate medical response.

### ACR appropriateness criteriaHematuria-child [^114bDi9D]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Hematuria is the presence of red blood cells in the urine, either visible to the eye (macroscopic hematuria) or as viewed under the microscope (microscopic hematuria). The clinical evaluation of children and adolescents with any form of hematuria begins with a meticulous history and thorough evaluation of the urine. The need for imaging evaluation depends on the clinical scenario in which hematuria presents, including the suspected etiology. Ultrasound and CT are the most common imaging methods used to assess hematuria in children, although other imaging modalities may be appropriate in certain instances. This review focuses on the following clinical variations of childhood hematuria: isolated hematuria (nonpainful, nontraumatic, and microscopic versus macroscopic), painful hematuria (ie, suspected nephrolithiasis or urolithiasis), and renal trauma with hematuria (microscopic versus macroscopic). The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Heavy hematuria requiring cystectomy in a patient with hemophilia A: a case report and literature review [^111Xzcg8]. BMC Urology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Hemophilia A is an X-linked recessive disorder caused by a deficiency in factor VIII. Hemophilia A affects 1 in 5,000–10,000 males. Hematuria is frequent in hemophilia. Hematuria in hemophilia is generally considered benign and manageable with conservative therapy; however, severe hematuria requiring surgical therapy has rarely been reported.

Case Presentation

A 60-year-old male with hemophilia A presented with persistent gross hematuria of unknown cause. He was treated with recombinant factor VIII products, followed by several conservative therapies as follows: clot evacuation by vesicoclysis, continuous bladder irrigation with normal saline, and intravesical instillation of aluminum hydroxide/magnesium hydroxide (Maalox); however, these failed to resolve the hemorrhaging. The patient was offered and consented to cystectomy with an ileal conduit. Intraoperative clotting was normal with the infusion of adequate recombinant factor VIII products and transfusion of fresh-frozen plasma, and the procedure was performed safely. After surgery, the patient had blood in his stool several times. No bleeding site was demonstrated in the colon by colonoscopy and (99m)Technetium-human serum albumin-diethylenetriaminepenta-acetic acid scintigraphy demonstrated that the extravasation of radioactive isotope was detected at the anal side of terminal ileum but not at the oral side. These findings were suspected to be bleeding from the ileoileal anastomosis. However, the bleeding was managed with recombinant factor VIII products.

Conclusions

Cystectomy in hemophilia may be safe, if monitored appropriately. Urinary diversion using the intestine may be avoided because anastomotic hemorrhage may become a problem.

### Updates to microhematuria: AUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^111bup6H]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Microhematuria follow-up after a negative evaluation: in patients with a negative risk-based hematuria evaluation, clinicians should engage in shared decision-making regarding whether to repeat urinalysis in the future (Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C). For patients with a prior negative hematuria evaluation and subsequent negative urinalysis, clinicians may discontinue further evaluation for microhematuria (Conditional Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C). For patients with a prior negative hematuria evaluation who have persistent or recurrent microhematuria at the time of repeat urinalysis, clinicians should engage in shared decision-making regarding the need for additional evaluation (Expert Opinion). For patients with a prior negative hematuria evaluation who develop gross hematuria, significant increase in degree of microhematuria, or new urologic symptoms, clinicians should initiate further evaluation (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C). Most patients who have an appropriate risk-stratified negative hematuria evaluation do not require ongoing urologic monitoring and may be safely discharged from the urology clinic after shared decision-making and discussion of the best available evidence, and for these patients a future UA may be considered.

### Evaluation of hematuria in children [^113qC96H]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

The detection of blood in a child's urine is alarming and often prompts many laboratory studies. Hematuria is one of the most important signs of renal or bladder disease, but proteinuria often is a more important diagnostic and prognostic finding. The physician should ensure that serious conditions are not overlooked, avoid unnecessary laboratory studies, reassure the family, and provide guidelines for additional studies if there is a change in the child's course. This article provides an approach to the evaluation and management of hematuria in a child. Many tests have been recommended for the child with hematuria, but no consensus exists on a systematic evaluation.

### Renal infarction without hematuria: two case reports [^115ywGxU]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Clinical cases of renal infarction are rarely seen and often either misdiagnosed or initially treated as something else. In most circumstances, renal infarctions are discovered accidentally, not due to a consideration of the diagnosis. A review of the literature reveals that we ought to search for the entity in patients with risk factors such as atrial fibrillation, infarction history or potential, mitral stenosis, infective endocarditis, atrial or ventricular septal defect, hypertension and ischemic heart diseases. In addition, the rise of LDH (lactate dehydrogenase) in serum and the presence of hematuria serves as a good indicator of the malady. We present two cases we encountered early this year in our Emergency Department. In both cases, white blood cell count and LDH showed significant increases, but there was no hematuria present. Both were successfully treated with LMWH (low-molecular-weight heparin). Upon discharge, both patients regained normal renal function.

### Updates to microhematuria: AUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^112njtLh]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Microhematuria — low/negligible-risk initial evaluation: In low/ negligible-risk patients with microhematuria, clinicians should obtain repeat urinalysis within six months rather than perform immediate cystoscopy or imaging (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C). Thus, given the low risk of malignancy and the potential harms of over-evaluation, the Panel recommends against routine cystoscopy and imaging for the initial evaluation of patients in the low-risk category and has renamed the category as low/negligible-risk to emphasize this point. The Panel acknowledges, however, that there may be scenarios in which cystoscopy in low/negligible-risk patients may be warranted based on symptoms, clinical suspicion or patient preference, and given the intermittent nature of hematuria, the Panel recommends a repeat UA with subsequent risk-based evaluation predicated on those results. Supporting validation studies found extremely low rates of malignancy among patients in the low-risk category (0%, 0.4% and 0%, respectively), and one study followed low-risk patients for a median of 26 months with no additional cancers identified.

### Percutaneous nephroureteral tube: a useful tool for management of intractable hematuria [^1173U82T]. Urology (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

To describe our experience using percutaneous nephroureteral (PCNU) tube placement for the management of intractable gross hematuria.

Methods

We identified patients at our institution who underwent PCNU tube placement from August 2011 to October 2017 for management of gross hematuria who had previously failed management with manual irrigation, continuous bladder irrigation, and cystoscopy with clot evacuation. The primary outcome measured was cessation of bleeding obviating the need for further blood transfusion in a 30 day follow-up period.

Results

Six patients were treated with PCNU tube placement for intractable hematuria from either malignant or nonmalignant etiologies. In all patients after PCNU tube placement, hematocrit value remained stable, there were no further transfusions requirements within 30 days, and no immediate or periprocedural complications were encountered. In no instance did a PCNU become obstructed by blood clots and in all cases the bladder and both kidneys were adequately drained.

Conclusion

In patients with hematuria refractory to conventional management techniques, the placement of a PCNU tube allows for cessation of bleeding, successfully diverts urine with no immediate complications and is not subsequent to clot obstruction of the tube. The use of PCNU tube is a viable treatment in the algorithm of intractable hematuria, specifically before resorting to more morbid and potentially irreversible treatments.

Upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) initial assessment and risk stratification — hemodynamic status should be assessed immediately upon presentation and resuscitative measures begun as needed (Strong recommendation). Blood transfusions should target hemoglobin ≥ 7 g/dl, with higher hemoglobins targeted in patients with clinical evidence of intravascular volume depletion or comorbidities, such as coronary artery disease (Conditional recommendation). Risk assessment should be performed to stratify patients into higher and lower risk categories and may assist in initial decisions such as timing of endoscopy, time of discharge, and level of care (Conditional recommendation). Discharge from the emergency department without inpatient endoscopy may be considered in patients with urea nitrogen < 18.2 mg/dl; hemoglobin ≥ 13.0 g/dl for men (12.0 g/dl for women), systolic blood pressure ≥ 110 mm Hg; pulse < 100 beats/min; and absence of melena, syncope, cardiac failure, and liver disease, as they have < 1% chance of requiring intervention (Conditional recommendation).

### Refractory hematuria in an oliguric patient after pancreas transplantation with exocrine pancreas bladder drainage [^112wRC3p]. European Urology (2011). Low credibility.

A 52-yr-old man presented with hematuria and clot retention. He had undergone simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplantation with exocrine pancreas bladder drainage 16 yr ago. The patient suffered from progressive transplant kidney failure with gradually decreasing urine output and needed hemodialysis every other day. Gross hematuria persisted after removal of all blood clots. Cystoscopy showed multiple small, flat ulcers of the bladder mucosa. Some bled discretely and were coagulated cautiously. However, hematuria was refractory to multiple urological interventions, which eventually necessitated an enteric diversion of the exocrine pancreas. Hematuria ceased following an uneventful postoperative course.

### An evidence-based microscopic hematuria care pathway optimizes decision-making among providers [^112PYwCc]. International Urogynecology Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction and Hypothesis

Microscopic hematuria (MH) has many etiologies in women and requires specific gynecologic evaluation. We created a standardized MH pathway to serve as an evidence-based decision aid for providers in our practice.

Methods

Using a modified Delphi process, a multidisciplinary team reviewed existing guidelines for MH diagnosis and treatment to reach consensus on care pathway components.

Results

Entry into the care pathway by an advanced practice provider is determined by the finding of ≥ 3 red blood cells per high-power field (RBC/HPF) on microscopic urinalysis. Initial evaluation includes history and physical exam. If there are signs of a gynecologic cause of MH, the conditions are treated and repeat urinalysis is performed in 6 months. If repeat urinalysis shows persistent MH or there are no other apparent causes for MH, we proceed with risk stratification. Through shared decision-making, low-risk patients may undergo repeat urinalysis in 6 months or cystoscopy with urinary tract ultrasound. For intermediate-risk patients, cystoscopy and urinary tract ultrasound are recommended. For high-risk patients, cystoscopy and axial upper urinary tract imaging are recommended. If evaluation is positive, urology referral is provided. If evaluation is negative, low-risk patients are released from care, but intermediate-risk or high-risk patients undergo repeat urinalysis in 12 months. If repeat urinalysis is positive, shared decision-making is used to determine a plan.

Conclusions

We developed an MH care pathway to standardize care of women with MH across a multidisciplinary group. This pathway serves as a component of value-based care and supports evidence-based care by providers.

Haematuria in patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is a very common manifestation. The cause of haematuria is often benign with the most common cause being haemorrhage within the renal cyst. But haematuria may also be caused by a coincident malignancy, the diagnosis of which may be missed if not investigated thoroughly. Herein, we present a case of ADPKD who presented to us with haematuria and was later found to have bladder cancer.

G2 is Hgb 10.0 to 8.0 g/dL; < 6.2 to 4.9 mmol/L; < 100 to 80 g/L with guidance to Hold ICPi and strongly consider permanent discontinuation. Administer 0.5–1 mg/kg/d prednisone equivalents. G3 is Hgb < 8.0 g/dL; < 4.9 mmol/L; < 80 g/L; transfusion indicated with Permanently discontinue ICPi, Prednisone 1–2 mg/kg/d (oral or IV equivalent depending on symptoms or speed of development), and transfusion precautions including Do not transfuse more than the minimum number of RBC units necessary to relieve the symptoms of anemia or to return a patient to a safe hemoglobin range (7–8 g/dL in stable, noncardiac inpatients), and Should offer patients supplementation with folic acid 1 mg daily. G4 is Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated with Permanently discontinue ICPi, IV prednisone corticosteroids 1–2 mg/kg/d, consideration of other immunosuppressive drugs if no improvement, and RBC transfusion per existing guidelines with Discuss with blood bank team before transfusions that a patient with possible ICPi SAE is in the hospital. Additional considerations include Monitor hemoglobin levels weekly until the steroid tapering process is complete. Thereafter, less frequent testing is needed.

### Surgical management of stones: American Urological Association / endourological society guideline, PART I [^116GLYCG]. The Journal of Urology (2016). Medium credibility.

Patients not considered candidates for PCNL — In patients not considered candidates for PCNL, clinicians may offer staged URS (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level Grade C). Relative contraindications to PCNL include use of anti-coagulation or anti-platelet therapy that cannot be discontinued or the presence of contractures, flexion deformities, or other anatomic derangements that may preclude positioning for PCNL. In these clinical scenarios, URS is a viable option, although it may require staged or repeated procedures to treat large stone volumes and may not render patients completely stone free, and URS can be safely performed in fully anticoagulated patients and in those on anti-platelet agents, although the risk of gross hematuria and clot retention/colic is higher.

### Evaluation of the patient with asymptomatic microscopic hematuria [^112zzZRS]. Academic Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

Asymptomatic microscopic hematuria (AMH) is relatively common in clinical practice but the etiology remains unclear in the majority of patients; it is rarely related to genitourinary malignancies. The 2012 guidelines of the American Urological Association recommend an evaluation after a single positive urinalysis with mandatory upper tract evaluation in all patients, preferably with CT urography (CTU). The likelihood of detecting significant upper track abnormalities, particularly malignancies is low with CTU, while incidental extraurinary abnormalities are often found, the majority of which are not clinically significant. The workup for these incidental findings has significant financial and clinical implications. Primary care physicians, who are most apt to encounter patients with AMH, have a low rate of adherence to the AUA guidelines, possibly as a result of the broadening of criteria for AMH evaluation by the AUA, with resultant uncertainty amongst primary care physicians about the appropriate candidates for such evaluation. Selection of subgroups of patients with risk factors for GU malignancies who may benefit from a complete evaluation is essential, as opposed to evaluation of all patients classified as having AMH.

### Aminocaproic acid [^117Pswex]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Aminocaproic Acid Injection, is useful in enhancing hemostasis when fibrinolysis contributes to bleeding. In life-threatening situations, fresh whole blood transfusions, fibrinogen infusions, and other emergency measures may be required.

Fibrinolytic bleeding may frequently be associated with surgical complications following heart surgery (with or without cardiac bypass procedures), and portacaval shunt; hematological disorders such as aplastic anemia; acute and life-threatening abruptio placentae; hepatic cirrhosis; and neoplastic disease such as carcinoma of the prostate, lung, stomach, and cervix.

Urinary fibrinolysis, usually a normal physiological phenomenon, may frequently be associated with life-threatening complications following severe trauma, anoxia, and shock. Symptomatic of such complications is surgical hematuria (following prostatectomy and nephrectomy) or nonsurgical hematuria (accompanying polycystic or neoplastic diseases of the genitourinary system).

### Rare causes of hematuria associated with various vascular diseases involving the upper urinary tract [^114HbVmm]. Radiographics (2008). Low credibility.

Hematuria is a commonly encountered symptom of a wide spectrum of diseases, including calculi, tumors, and vascular abnormalities. In rare cases, hematuria is caused by life-threatening vascular diseases. When hematuria is encountered, physicians sometimes fail to include vascular diseases in the differential diagnosis because of their rare association with hematuria. Likewise, radiologists often fail to do so because of the low frequency of occurrence of these diseases. Multidetector computed tomography performed with the bolus injection technique should be the first-line diagnostic test when vascular disease is suspected. Radiologists should be familiar with the various imaging findings of hematuria caused by vascular disease. They should also be familiar with the management options (including endovascular techniques) for hematuria caused by vascular disease, since in some cases affected patients can be treated with interventional procedures.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for microhematuria, more specifically with respect to urine cytology, AUA/SUFU 2025 guidelines recommend to consider offering urine cytology or validated urine-based tumor markers to appropriately counseled intermediate-risk patients who wish to avoid cystoscopy and accept the risk of forgoing direct visual inspection of the bladder urothelium. Obtain renal and bladder ultrasound in these cases.

### Management of anaemia and iron deficiency in patients with cancer: ESMO clinical practice guidelines [^113phhGj]. Annals of Oncology (2018). Medium credibility.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for cancer-related anemia, more specifically with respect to RBC transfusion, ESMO 2018 guidelines recommend to consider performing RBC transfusion without delay in patients with hemoglobin < 7–8 g/dL and/or severe anemia-related symptoms (even at higher hemoglobin levels) and requiring immediate hemoglobin and symptom improvement.

### Redefining clinically significant hematuria after holmium enucleation of the prostate [^116WygSB]. Journal of Endourology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction and Objective: Holmium laser enucleation of the prostate (HoLEP) is often offered for symptomatic prostatic enlargement at high risk for bleeding. However, prior studies define clinically significant hematuria (CSH) narrowly as the need for blood transfusion or significant decrease in hemoglobin. We sought to evaluate risk factors contributing to a broader definition of CSH, which may contribute to alteration of clinical course. Methods: We analyzed 164 patients in a prospectively maintained database who underwent HoLEP at a single institution across two surgeons from November 2020 to April 2023. HoLEP was performed using Moses 2.0 (Boston Scientific) laser and the Piranha enucleation system (Richard Wolf). We defined CSH broadly as follows: clot retention, return to operating room, perioperative management variation due to hematuria, or continued gross hematuria past 1 month postoperatively. Univariable and multivariable ANOVAs were used. Multivariable analysis of CSH risk based on the use of antiplatelet (AP) agents or anticoagulants included correction for age, enucleation time (surrogate for case difficulty), and prostate volume. Results: 17.7% (29/164) of our patients developed CSH after HoLEP. Longer enucleation time was a mild risk factor for developing CSH (multivariate odds ratio [OR] 1.01, p = 0.02). The strongest predictor of CSH was the use of anticoagulation or AP agents (OR 2.71 p < 0.02 on univariable analysis, OR 2.34 p < 0.02 on multivariable analysis), even when aspirin 81mg was excluded. Conclusion: With a broadened definition, 18% of patients developed CSH following HoLEP, which impacted the clinical course. Our data suggest that the current definition of significant hematuria is too narrow and does not capture many patients whose clinical course is affected by hematuria. While safe, anticoagulants and APs significantly predicted an increased CSH risk, and patients should be counseled accordingly.

### Approach to the child with hematuria [^1119aojP]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

The causes of macroscopic and microscopic hematuria overlap; both are often caused by urinary tract infections or urethral/bladder irritation. Coexistent hypertension and proteinuria should prompt investigation for glomerular disease. The most common glomerulonephritis in children is postinfectious glomerulonephritis. In most patients, and especially with isolated microscopic hematuria, the diagnostic workup reveals no clear underlying cause. In those cases whereby a diagnosis is made, the most common causes of persistent microscopic hematuria are thin basement membrane nephropathy, immunoglobulin A nephropathy, or idiopathic hypercalciuria. Treatment and long-term prognosis varies with the underlying disease.
