## Question

what imaging should be done?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what imaging should be done. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical question and how to frame it using a PICO approach. Then, I should verify the highest-credibility guidelines and appropriateness criteria for the specific scenario. Next, I will appraise the evidence hierarchy and weigh benefits versus risks, including radiation, contrast, and downstream effects. After that, I should consider patient-specific modifiers such as age, pregnancy, renal function, and comorbidities. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stepwise recommendation and note uncertainties or areas where shared decision-making is essential, anchoring to ACR Appropriateness Criteria and major society guidelines where available [^064c1412] [^e66e465c].

> Let me first confirm the clinical question framing, because if I get the PICO wrong, the imaging choice will be off. I need to specify the Population, the clinical Indication or suspected diagnosis, the Comparator modalities under consideration, and the Outcomes that matter — diagnostic yield, management change, radiation exposure, cost, and patient-centered outcomes — so that I can align the test with what will actually change care [^064c1412] [^1b0e2d37].

> Next, I should review the highest-credibility guidance for the scenario. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should verify whether the ACR Appropriateness Criteria directly address this indication and, if not, look for specialty society guidelines. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria cover hundreds of clinical scenarios and are updated regularly, and major cardiology, emergency medicine, and oncology guidelines often provide modality-specific recommendations that complement ACR AC, so I will prioritize those sources first [^064c1412] [^e66e465c] [^0abf2e6f].

> I will now examine the evidence hierarchy and appraise the strength of recommendations. Wait, let me verify whether the guidance is based on RCTs, meta-analyses, or primarily expert consensus; many imaging appropriateness criteria rely on Delphi processes and GRADE-style ratings when direct comparative trials are sparse, so I should flag areas where the evidence base is weak and where shared decision-making is especially important [^064c1412] [^1b0e2d37] [^9e564b0f].

> I need to ensure I weigh benefits versus risks for each modality. Benefits include diagnostic accuracy, likelihood of changing management, and prognostic value, whereas risks include radiation exposure, contrast-related nephrotoxicity or allergy, false positives leading to cascade testing, sedation needs, and cost; in pediatrics, radiation risks are magnified, so I should double-check pediatric-specific guidance and dose-optimization principles before recommending CT or nuclear studies [^c2787a0f] [^7ac11ef3] [^69ef28a9].

> Let me consider patient-specific modifiers that can pivot the choice. Age, pregnancy status, renal function, body habitus, hemodynamic stability, and device compatibility can shift the optimal modality; for example, MRI may be contraindicated with certain implants, CT may be limited by contrast or obesity, and ultrasound may be operator-dependent or limited by body habitus, so I should confirm these constraints before finalizing the order [^26c6dc09] [^7b040c3c] [^c2787a0f].

> Now, I should synthesize a stepwise recommendation. First, confirm whether imaging is indicated at all using guideline triggers and red flags; if not, avoid imaging. Second, if imaging is indicated, select the modality with the best diagnostic yield for the specific question while minimizing harm; if multiple modalities are reasonable, choose the lowest-risk option that answers the question. Third, tailor technique and protocol to the patient and local expertise. Fourth, document the clinical question and rationale to support appropriateness and facilitate future care coordination [^064c1412] [^1b0e2d37] [^e66e465c].

> But wait, what if the scenario is acute chest pain with intermediate pretest probability of coronary disease? I should confirm that contemporary guidelines support either coronary CCTA or noninvasive stress testing, with PET preferred over SPECT when available, and emphasize shared decision-making and patient preferences in test selection; this aligns with ACC/AHA/ASE chest pain guidance and the multimodality imaging AUCs [^e66e465c] [^479e5302] [^ca8f8434].

> Hold on, I should verify pediatric nuances. For pediatric abdominal pain, ultrasound is first-line for suspected appendicitis; for pediatric trauma, plain radiography is often appropriate initially, with CT reserved for high-risk mechanisms or unstable patients and MRI considered for ligamentous or cord injuries; for pediatric sepsis, ultrasound and radiography are prioritized to localize infection while minimizing radiation, consistent with AAP policy and ACR AC [^88e1d68e] [^e6ea1e33] [^6db87138] [^c2787a0f].

> I should double-check that I am not overpromising on evidence quality. Many imaging recommendations rest on expert consensus rather than RCTs, so I need to communicate uncertainty transparently and engage in shared decision-making when the benefit-harm balance is close or when patient values differ from default pathways; this is especially true for emerging modalities or when incidental findings are likely [^9e564b0f] [^785f334e].

> Finally, I need to ensure system-level considerations are addressed. Local availability, expertise, and turnaround times matter; if the optimal modality is unavailable or delayed, a reasonable alternative that answers the clinical question may be preferred, and I should document why I deviated from the ideal pathway. I should also consider CDS integration to reduce low-value imaging and track appropriateness over time [^064c1412] [^21283565].

The right imaging test depends on the **clinical question** [^064c1412], patient factors (age, pregnancy, comorbidities) [^69ef28a9], and local resources [^26c6dc09]. Use **ACR Appropriateness Criteria** [^064c1412] or specialty guidelines to match indication to modality, and prefer the lowest-risk, highest-yield option first (e.g. ultrasound or MRI when appropriate) [^69ef28a9]. Avoid routine imaging without a clear indication [^e811b5cd], and apply shared decision-making when benefits and risks are balanced [^e66e465c].

---

## General principles for selecting imaging modalities

- **Clinical question**: Define the diagnostic or therapeutic question clearly [^064c1412].
- **Patient factors**: Consider age, pregnancy, comorbidities, and preferences [^69ef28a9].
- **Modality strengths**: Match modality to the clinical scenario (e.g. ultrasound for biliary symptoms, CT for acute abdomen, MRI for soft tissue or neurologic disease) [^0abf2e6f].
- **Risk–benefit balance**: Weigh radiation, contrast, and sedation risks against diagnostic yield [^69ef28a9].
- **Guideline adherence**: Use ACR Appropriateness Criteria [^064c1412] or specialty guidelines to guide selection [^e66e465c].

## Common clinical scenarios and recommended imaging modalities

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended imaging modality** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| Acute chest pain (intermediate risk) | Coronary CT angiography (CCTA) or stress testing | Noninvasive coronary evaluation; patient-specific selection [^e66e465c] [^479e5302] |
| Suspected pulmonary embolism | CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA) | High sensitivity and specificity [^notfound] |
| Acute abdominal pain | CT abdomen/pelvis with contrast | Rapid, comprehensive evaluation [^notfound] |
| Suspected appendicitis (pediatric) | Ultrasound first-line | Avoids radiation; high sensitivity in children [^88e1d68e] |
| Suspected stroke | Noncontrast CT head followed by CT angiography/perfusion | Rapid exclusion of hemorrhage; guides thrombolysis [^notfound] |
| Suspected malignancy | MRI or CT depending on site | Superior soft tissue contrast (MRI) or whole-body staging (CT) [^notfound] |
| Routine screening | Mammography, colonoscopy, low-dose CT lung | Evidence-based screening programs [^notfound] |

---

## Special considerations

- **Pediatric patients**: Minimize radiation; ultrasound or MRI preferred when feasible [^c2787a0f] [^7ac11ef3].
- **Pregnant patients**: Avoid ionizing radiation; ultrasound or MRI preferred [^c47adc60].
- **Contrast allergies**: Use non-contrast alternatives or premedication when contrast is essential [^26c6dc09].
- **Resource limitations**: Adapt modality choice to local availability and expertise [^26c6dc09].

## Role of clinical decision support systems (CDSS)

CDSS can reduce inappropriate imaging by embedding **guideline-based prompts** [^21283565] into order entry, though uptake varies and requires workflow integration [^e9e57d6b].

---

## Conclusion

Imaging selection should be **indication-driven**, patient-centered, and evidence-based [^064c1412]. Use the lowest-risk, highest-yield modality first, align with guidelines, and apply shared decision-making when benefits and risks are balanced [^e66e465c].

### Imaging of heart disease in women: review and case presentation [^fc7831e5]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

This review highlights sex-specific considerations that are critical for selecting the most appropriate cardiac imaging modality — with particular focus on challenges and opportunities of contemporary CVD management in women. Indeed, awareness about female attributes in cardiac imaging, considering technical implications and female-specific conditions, might help alleviate the burden of CVD in this subpopulation. Consequently, there is an urgent need for imaging guidelines that are tailored to women and men. While efforts have been made in this direction, substantial knowledge gaps still exist. Future imaging studies and recommendations require the integration of sex as an algorithm-modifying variable. In the era of precision medicine, accounting for sex disparities seems crucial to provide the best possible cardiovascular care to women and men.

### Optimum imaging strategies for advanced prostate cancer: ASCO guideline [^9afcfec8]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Provide evidence- and expert-based recommendations for optimal use of imaging in advanced prostate cancer. Due to increases in research and utilization of novel imaging for advanced prostate cancer, this guideline is intended to outline techniques available and provide recommendations on appropriate use of imaging for specified patient subgroups.

Methods

An Expert Panel was convened with members from ASCO and the Society of Abdominal Radiology, American College of Radiology, Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging, American Urological Association, American Society for Radiation Oncology, and Society of Urologic Oncology to conduct a systematic review of the literature and develop an evidence-based guideline on the optimal use of imaging for advanced prostate cancer. Representative index cases of various prostate cancer disease states are presented, including suspected high-risk disease, newly diagnosed treatment-naïve metastatic disease, suspected recurrent disease after local treatment, and progressive disease while undergoing systemic treatment. A systematic review of the literature from 2013 to August 2018 identified fully published English-language systematic reviews with or without meta-analyses, reports of rigorously conducted phase III randomized controlled trials that compared ≥ 2 imaging modalities, and noncomparative studies that reported on the efficacy of a single imaging modality.

Results

A total of 35 studies met inclusion criteria and form the evidence base, including 17 systematic reviews with or without meta-analysis and 18 primary research articles.

Recommendations

One or more of these imaging modalities should be used for patients with advanced prostate cancer: conventional imaging (defined as computed tomography [CT], bone scan, and/or prostate magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) and/or next-generation imaging (NGI), positron emission tomography [PET], PET/CT, PET/MRI, or whole-body MRI) according to the clinical scenario.

### ACR appropriateness criteria pelvic floor dysfunction [^c62db857]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

Pelvic floor dysfunction is a common and potentially complex condition. Imaging can complement physical examination by revealing clinically occult abnormalities and clarifying the nature of the pelvic floor defects present. Imaging can add value in preoperative management for patients with a complex clinical presentation, and in postoperative management of patients suspected to have recurrent pelvic floor dysfunction or a surgical complication. Imaging findings are only clinically relevant if the patient is symptomatic. Several imaging modalities have a potential role in evaluating patients; the choice of modality depends on the patient's symptoms, the clinical information desired, and the usefulness of the test. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions; they are reviewed every 3 years by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and review include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer-reviewed journals, and the application of a well-established consensus methodology (modified Delphi) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures by the panel. In instances in which evidence is lacking or not definitive, expert opinion may be used to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Pediatric radiology demystified: a bird' s-eye view of diagnostic imaging [^9dffcf66]. Pediatrics in Review (2025). Medium credibility.

Pediatric patients present unique diagnostic challenges due to their developing anatomy and distinct disease patterns. The field of pediatric radiology is integral to nearly every clinical specialty for bridging the gap between clinical evaluation and diagnosis. Imaging children requires careful consideration of each imaging modality to ensure diagnostic accuracy while minimizing risk to the child. Advances in diagnostic imaging have transformed our ability to visualize anatomy and pathology in pediatric patients. Navigating this diverse array of imaging options can be daunting for clinicians, as each modality comes with its own set of advantages, limitations, and safety considerations. Incorporating education and collaboration between pediatricians and radiologists can help ensure imaging is used effectively. We offer an overview of pediatric diagnostic imaging modalities, comparing their applications and best practices. By clarifying their appropriate use, we aim to empower clinical providers to make informed decisions that optimize patient care.

### American college of radiology appropriateness criteria: advancing evidence-based imaging practice [^064c1412]. Seminars in Nuclear Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

ACR Appropriateness Criteria (ACR AC) are evidence-based guidelines to assist referring physicians, other providers, and patients in making the most appropriate imaging or treatment decision for a specific clinical condition. The ACR AC are created by expert panels consisting of multidisciplinary physicians, using principles outlined by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality as designed by the Institute of Medicine. The ACR AC are qualified appropriate use criteria as designated under the Protecting Access to Medicare Act legislation of 2014. The ACR AC development process includes topic selection, literature search, evidence table development, appropriateness (risk-benefit) assessment, patient and public input, document publication and ACR AC content dissemination through clinical decision support mechanisms, and periodic review. These criteria benchmark the selection of the most appropriate imaging or treatments, as well as educating radiology, nuclear medicine, and other clinical discipline trainees.

### ACR appropriateness criteriaSoft-tissue Masses [^f7177b16]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Imaging is an integral component of the evaluation of patients with a suspected soft-tissue mass. Imaging can not only confirm the presence of a mass but can provide essential information necessary for diagnosis, local staging, and biopsy planning. Although the objectives of the evaluation have not changed, the choices available for imaging of musculoskeletal masses have evolved dramatically in recent years. The purpose of this document is to identify the most common clinical scenarios and the most appropriate imaging for their assessment on the basis of the current literature and to provide general guidance for those scenarios that are not specifically addressed. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### ACR appropriateness criteria low back Pain [^ebf9c160]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

Most patients presenting with uncomplicated acute low back pain (LBP) and/or radiculopathy do not require imaging. Imaging is considered in those patients who have had up to 6 weeks of medical management and physical therapy that resulted in little or no improvement in their back pain. It is also considered for those patients presenting with red flags raising suspicion for serious underlying conditions, such as cauda equina syndrome, malignancy, fracture, and infection. Many imaging modalities are available to clinicians and radiologists for evaluating LBP. Application of these modalities depends largely on the working diagnosis, the urgency of the clinical problem, and comorbidities of the patient. When there is concern for fracture of the lumbar spine, multidetector CT is recommended. Those deemed to be interventional candidates, with LBP lasting for > 6 weeks having completed conservative management with persistent radiculopathic symptoms, may seek MRI. Patients with severe or progressive neurologic deficit on presentation and red flags should be evaluated with MRI. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (the RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances in which evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® anorectal disease [^fe8f7753]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

This review summarizes the relevant literature for the selection of the initial imaging in 4 clinical scenarios in patients with suspected inflammatory disease or postoperative complication of the anorectum. These clinical scenarios include suspected perianal fistula or abscess; rectovesicular or rectovaginal fistula; proctitis or pouchitis; and suspected complication following proctectomy, coloproctectomy, or colectomy with a pouch or other anastomosis. The appropriateness of imaging modalities as they apply to each clinical scenario is rated as usually appropriate, may be appropriate, and usually not appropriate to assist the selection of the most appropriate imaging modality in the corresponding clinical scenarios of anorectal disease. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Do clinicians use the American college of radiology appropriateness criteria in the management of their patients? [^f9060acf]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to investigate the use of the American College of Radiology (ACR) appropriateness criteria by referring physicians during decision making about imaging in the management of their patients.

Conclusion

There is a low utilization of the ACR appropriateness criteria by clinicians when ordering imaging studies for their patients. The ACR has invested a great deal of resources in these criteria and should therefore be aware of information regarding utilization. Our findings may have implications about how the ACR appropriateness criteria are reviewed, revised, and disseminated.

### Neuroimaging and diagnostic workup for headache [^b3c7feff]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

Neuroimaging can play a vital role in headache evaluation, though its utilization must be judicious and evidence-based. While a comprehensive clinical assessment is always fundamental, imaging is essential for the diagnosis of many headache disorders. There exist several guidelines for headache imaging, but overutilization of imaging and missed diagnoses due to inappropriate imaging selection remain a significant challenge. This article examines the role of neuroimaging in primary and secondary headache disorders, discusses the strengths and limitations of different imaging modalities, and provides a practical framework for optimizing imaging utilization while maintaining resource efficiency.

### Imaging in childhood cancer: a society for pediatric radiology and children's oncology group joint task force report [^521c1475]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

Contemporary medical imaging is a cornerstone of care for children with cancer. As 5-year survival rates for children with cancer exceed 80%, imaging technologies have evolved in parallel to include a wide array of modalities. Here, we overview the risks and benefits associated with commonly used imaging modalities and survey the current landscape of medical imaging for children with cancer. We find evidence-based imaging guidelines to assist in protocol development and to guide decision-making for optimal patient care are often lacking. The substantial variation in protocol-based recommendations for imaging both during and following therapy may hinder optimal clinical research and clinical care for children with cancer.

### Imaging of acute ischemic stroke [^f81785e0]. Emergency Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

For decades, imaging has been a critical component of the diagnostic evaluation and management of patients suspected of acute ischemic stroke (AIS). With each new advance in the treatment of AIS, the role of imaging has expanded in scope, sophistication, and importance in selecting patients who stand to benefit from potential therapies. Although the field of stroke imaging has been evolving for many years, there have been several major recent changes. Most notably, in late 2017, the window for treatment expanded to 24 h from onset of stroke symptoms in selected patients. Furthermore, for those patients in expanded time windows, guidelines issued in early 2018 now recommend the use of "advanced" imaging techniques in the acute setting, including CT perfusion and MRI, to guide therapeutic decision-making. With these and other changes, the emergency radiologist must be prepared to handle a growing volume and complexity of AIS imaging. This article reviews the various imaging modalities and techniques employed in the imaging of AIS patients, with an emphasis on recommendations from recent randomized controlled trials and national consensus guidelines.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® nontraumatic aortic disease [^c1ae7867]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Nontraumatic aortic disease can be caused by a wide variety of disorders including congenital, inflammatory, infectious, metabolic, neoplastic, and degenerative processes. Imaging examinations such as radiography, ultrasound, echocardiography, catheter-based angiography, CT, MRI, and nuclear medicine examinations are essential for diagnosis, treatment planning, and assessment of therapeutic response. Depending upon the clinical scenario, each of these modalities has strengths and weaknesses. Whenever possible, the selection of a diagnostic imaging examination should be based upon the best available evidence. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment. The purpose of this document is to assist physicians select the most appropriate diagnostic imaging examination for nontraumatic aortic diseases.

### Clinical quantitative coronary artery stenosis and coronary atherosclerosis imaging: a consensus statement from the quantitative cardiovascular imaging study group [^830d6843]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2023). High credibility.

The detection and characterization of coronary artery stenosis and atherosclerosis using imaging tools are key for clinical decision-making in patients with known or suspected coronary artery disease. In this regard, imaging-based quantification can be improved by choosing the most appropriate imaging modality for diagnosis, treatment and procedural planning. In this Consensus Statement, we provide clinical consensus recommendations on the optimal use of different imaging techniques in various patient populations and describe the advances in imaging technology. Clinical consensus recommendations on the appropriateness of each imaging technique for direct coronary artery visualization were derived through a three-step, real-time Delphi process that took place before, during and after the Second International Quantitative Cardiovascular Imaging Meeting in September 2022. According to the Delphi survey answers, CT is the method of choice to rule out obstructive stenosis in patients with an intermediate pre-test probability of coronary artery disease and enables quantitative assessment of coronary plaque with respect to dimensions, composition, location and related risk of future cardiovascular events, whereas MRI facilitates the visualization of coronary plaque and can be used in experienced centres as a radiation-free, second-line option for non-invasive coronary angiography. PET has the greatest potential for quantifying inflammation in coronary plaque but SPECT currently has a limited role in clinical coronary artery stenosis and atherosclerosis imaging. Invasive coronary angiography is the reference standard for stenosis assessment but cannot characterize coronary plaques. Finally, intravascular ultrasonography and optical coherence tomography are the most important invasive imaging modalities for the identification of plaques at high risk of rupture. The recommendations made in this Consensus Statement will help clinicians to choose the most appropriate imaging modality on the basis of the specific clinical scenario, individual patient characteristics and the availability of each imaging modality.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding: 2024 update [^972e7426]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

This document summarizes the relevant literature for the selection of the initial imaging in five clinical scenarios in patients with suspected or known nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). These clinical scenarios include suspected nonvariceal UGIB without endoscopy performed; endoscopically confirmed nonvariceal UGIB with clear source but treatment not possible or continued bleeding after endoscopic treatment; endoscopically confirmed nonvariceal UGIB without a confirmed source; suspected nonvariceal UGIB with negative endoscopy; and postsurgical or post-traumatic nonvariceal UGIB when endoscopy is contraindicated. The appropriateness of imaging modalities as they apply to each clinical scenario is rated as usually appropriate, may be appropriate, and usually not appropriate to assist the selection of the most appropriate imaging modality in the corresponding clinical scenarios of nonvariceal UGIB. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

### Variation in pediatric cervical spine imaging across trauma centers – A cause for concern? [^e6ea1e33]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Cervical spine injury is rare in the pediatric trauma patient but also particularly difficult to diagnose and devastating when missed. We found that less than 4% of pediatric trauma patients included in the TQIP database received any cervical spine imaging but that when it was performed, the most common modality was a cervical spine CT. Despite validated protocols intended to guide cervical spine imaging decisions in the care of pediatric trauma patients, our findings substantiated the hypothesis that there is persistent variation in the use of cervical spine imaging in the initial evaluation of these children.

Our findings should be contextualized with respect to the established algorithms intended to guide clinicians toward the best practice for initial cervical spine imaging of pediatric (and adult) trauma patients. While a single gold standard does not exist, the American College of Radiology does release their annually updated Appropriateness Criteria for Suspected Spinal Trauma in the Child. This comprehensive report, which reviews the latest literature and draws upon the validated NEXUS, PECARN, and Pierretti-Vanmarcke clinical decision rules, as well as the expert opinion of a multidisciplinary panel when evidence is lacking or conflicted, promulgates the appropriateness of each imaging modality for various presenting characteristics of trauma patients. Notably, plain radiography is the only modality with a favorable risk-to-benefit ratio established for nearly all clinical scenarios warranting cervical spine imaging.

While cervical spine CT is the most sensitive and, hence, preferred imaging modality for suspected adult CSI, its utility for the pediatric population is debated. Pediatric trauma patients who are obtunded, experienced polytrauma, or were injured by a high-risk mechanism are likely to benefit from cervical spine CT. As older pediatric patients have cervical spine anatomy, physiology, and biomechanics more similar to adults, clinicians may opt more often for cervical spine CT in these patients as well. It is important to note, however, that negative cervical spine CT scans, like negative cervical spine plain radiography, cannot exclude all cervical spine injuries. In particular, spinal cord injury without radiographic abnormality (SCIWORA) presents without fracture nor dislocation on both radiography and CT, and is more common in pediatric patients, particularly those younger than 8 years. Because of this, clinicians are urged to have a low threshold for cervical spine MRI use — MRI's superior soft tissue and bone visualization capabilities are better suited for the cervical spine anatomy (e.g. ligamentous laxity) and injury patterns of the pediatric population; indeed, MRI has the highest sensitivity and specificity for acute pediatric CSI.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® sepsis [^6db87138]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Sepsis is defined as a life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. A search for the underlying cause of infection typically includes radiological imaging as part of this investigation. This document focuses on thoracic and abdominopelvic causes of sepsis. In 2017, the global incidence of sepsis was estimated to be 48.9 million cases, with 11 million sepsis-related deaths (accounting for nearly 20% of all global deaths); therefore, understanding which imaging modalities and types of studies are acceptable or not acceptable is imperative. The 5 variants provided include the most commonly encountered scenarios in the setting of sepsis along with recommendations and data for each imaging study. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

### Approaches to enhancing radiation safety in cardiovascular imaging: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^69ef28a9]. Circulation (2014). Medium credibility.

Justification and patient-centered imaging in cardiac imaging emphasizes that appropriate selection of patients is the first step toward enhancing radiation safety and that when imaging is used appropriately its clinical benefits almost always outweigh radiation risks; however, if a comparable test that does not use ionizing radiation can provide needed information with comparable accuracy, cost, and convenience but lower overall risk, then it may be preferred. A key objective of patient-centered imaging is to individualize the decision and imaging type to provide incremental information that, when added to clinical judgment, improves outcomes, taking into account patient age, sex, presence or absence of symptoms, and presence or absence of known coronary artery disease; patient preferences should be elicited and considered; the imaging protocol should be tailored to the patient; every effort should be made to avoid unnecessary serial imaging; clinicians should obtain and review prior records to avoid repeated procedures; and repeat studies, including duplicate imaging and "layered" testing, should only be requested for appropriate indications with clear documentation and communication of the indication and reason for repeating the test.

Imaging modality selection for stable chest pain — triage, modality choice, and patient engagement are outlined as follows: contemporary randomized trials support that candidates for elective coronary angiography may be safely triaged using coronary computed tomographic angiography (CCTA) or noninvasive stress testing, and patient characteristics and existing contraindications for a given test modality should be considered when choosing a diagnostic test. In patients selected for stress imaging who are able to exercise, exercise testing is preferred over pharmacologic stress to improve the diagnostic and prognostic information of the test, and although positron emission tomography (PET) and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) are grouped together, PET has improved diagnostic and prognostic performance, especially when quantitative assessment of myocardial blood flow (MBF) can be performed. For evaluation and testing decisions, the patient should be engaged in a process of shared decision-making before determining the final choice of the cardiac test modality and in guiding the pathway for treatment decisions.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2020). High credibility.

Congenital heart disease (CHD) follow-up imaging — general principles and assumptions: Radiation dose estimates from cardiac computed tomography (CCT) scans in children are highly variable and related to scanner platforms and the aggressiveness of radiation dose optimization, and for cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) an implanted electronic device must be thoroughly evaluated to ensure that it does not pose a significant safety risk, with the comprehensive risk profile of imaging modalities carefully factored into decisions for each clinical scenario. This document refers to patients as infants, children, or adults, and adolescents are not specifically mentioned; however, indications that include CMR and CCT for adults may be applied to compliant adolescents. It is assumed that a comprehensive history and physical examination have been performed by a qualified clinician with signs and symptoms accurately reflecting current status, and that tests are ordered by clinicians knowledgeable in CHD and performed and interpreted by qualified personnel in facilities compliant with national standards. Clinicians should use their best judgment and available clinical practice guidelines to assess clinical significance and severity before classifying indications, with clear documentation of the reason for testing in the medical record; if the reason for a test can be assigned to more than 1 indication, the justification should be classified under the most clinically significant indication. Indications related to routine surveillance have a specified time range, which does not imply that an imaging modality rated Appropriate is mandatory at every follow-up visit, and clinicians and patients should have flexibility to obtain the test at a time reasonably close to the specified period; for some indications a broad time range is presented to cover a wider spectrum of symptomatic patients, and clinicians should use their best judgment and weigh risks and benefits of modalities before ordering a test. Cost is considered implicitly in the appropriate use determination, with clinical benefits considered first and costs considered in relationship to these benefits to convey net value.

Appropriate use definition — applied across technologies and procedures — is described as follows. The document states, "A consistent definition of appropriate use that includes consideration of risks and benefits is applied across technologies and procedures". It defines that "An appropriate diagnostic or therapeutic procedure is one in which the expected clinical benefit exceeds the risks of the procedure by a sufficiently wide margin, such that the procedure is generally considered acceptable or reasonable care". For diagnostic imaging, "benefits include incremental information, which when combined with clinical judgment, augments efficient patient care", and "These benefits are weighed against the expected negative consequences (risks include the potential hazard of missed diagnoses, radiation, contrast, and/or unnecessary downstream procedures)". It also notes, "The risks and benefits correspond with the different classes of cardiovascular services".

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Medium credibility.

Imaging modality selection and patient risk factors — patient risk factors, including patient age, comorbidities, and natural life expectancy, should be considered. For younger patients without comorbidities, radiation-based imaging is less preferred than for older patients with limited life expectancies, and physicians should employ the ACC appropriate use criteria as a point of departure in making these judgments. When feasible, particularly in younger patients, an alternative imaging procedure that does not use ionizing radiation may be preferable (e.g., cardiovascular magnetic resonance or echocardiography).

### Optimizing advanced imaging of the pediatric patient in the emergency department: policy statement [^c2787a0f]. Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

American Academy of Pediatrics policy statement — advanced imaging in the pediatric emergency department states that advanced imaging, including ultrasonography, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), is an integral component to the evaluation and management of ill and injured children in the emergency department, but the benefits and potential impacts on management must be weighed against the risks. The statement notes important considerations specific to the pediatric patient for the ordering and interpretation of advanced imaging and provides guidelines for institutions and those who care for children to optimize use in the emergency department; the intent is to guide decision-making where children may access care. The introduction emphasizes that advanced imaging is commonly used in the emergency department (ED) and has increased dramatically over time as modalities have become more accurate, faster, and more widely available, while risks include radiation exposure, false-positive and incidental findings with downstream testing, increases in ED length of stay, sedation, transport away from the ED, overall health care costs, and the possibility that studies may need to be repeated if not optimally performed.

### Optimizing diagnostic imaging in the emergency department [^c2cc3bc2]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

While emergency diagnostic imaging use has increased significantly, there is a lack of evidence for corresponding improvements in patient outcomes. Optimizing emergency department (ED) diagnostic imaging has the potential to improve the quality, safety, and outcomes of ED patients, but to date, there have not been any coordinated efforts to further our evidence-based knowledge in this area. The objective of this article is to discuss six aspects of diagnostic imaging to provide background information on the underlying framework for the 2015 Academic Emergency Medicine consensus conference, "Diagnostic Imaging in the Emergency Department: A Research Agenda to Optimize Utilization". The consensus conference aims to generate a high priority research agenda for emergency diagnostic imaging that will inform the design of future investigations. The six components herein will serve as the group topics for the conference: 1) patient-centered outcomes research; 2) clinical decision rules; 3) training, education, and competency; 4) knowledge translation and barriers to image optimization; 5) use of administrative data; and 6) comparative effectiveness research: alternatives to traditional CT use.

### Society for endocrinology clinical practice guideline for the evaluation of androgen excess in women [^b5263216]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). Medium credibility.

Overall, comprehensive data directly comparing differing imaging approaches in the evaluation of severe androgen excess are lacking; therefore, clinical presentation in tandem with reasoned biochemical evaluation are crucial to determining which imaging modality is most appropriate.

Recommendations
When there is a high index of suspicion for PCOS, transvaginal ultrasound is the first‐line imaging modality in selected patients and where culturally acceptable. Imaging is not necessary if two Rotterdam criteria are otherwise met (i.e. androgen excess and oligomenorrhoea) unless there are otherwise atypical clinical and biochcemical features.
If clinical indications suggest non‐PCOS pathology, cross‐sectional imaging of the ovaries and/or adrenals should be undertaken as appropriate
MRI pelvis should be undertaken if an ovarian tumour is strongly suspected.
Urgent cross‐sectional imaging (CT or MRI) should be undertaken if an adrenal pathology is suspected.

Imaging in the trauma patient who is morbidly obese — key points emphasize that obesity compromises the clinical examination and all imaging modalities, and CT remains the mainstay for diagnostic imaging in trauma patients with morbid obesity; if the facility's capability to image is inadequate, imaging outsourcing or transfer of care may be required, and facilities treating trauma patients must know the weight and size limits of their radiologic equipment and regularly review and update radiologic technology to minimize the impact on care to patients with obesity. Epidemiology notes that one in 3 adults in the United States is obese (BMI of 30 kg/m² or higher) and that nearly 7 percent of the United States population is morbidly obese (BMI greater than 40 kg/m²).

### Pregnancy-associated breast cancer: why breast imaging during pregnancy and lactation matters [^c47adc60]. Journal of Breast Imaging (2023). Medium credibility.

Pregnancy-associated breast cancer is characterized as breast cancer diagnosed during pregnancy, within the first postpartum year, or during lactation. It usually presents as a palpable mass, although the large majority of palpable masses during pregnancy are benign. Breast cancer is the most common invasive malignancy diagnosed during pregnancy and lactation, and its incidence is increasing as more women delay childbearing. Understanding the appropriate methods for screening and diagnostic workup of breast findings in this population is imperative for radiologists to promptly diagnose pregnancy-associated breast cancer. Use of available imaging modalities should be tailored to patient-specific factors, with US typically the first-line modality due to patient age and decreased sensitivity of mammography in the setting of lactational changes. This article illustrates the spectrum of imaging appearances of pregnancy-associated breast cancer, the appropriate diagnostic imaging workup, and the unique challenges encountered in evaluation of this patient population.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® on renal failure [^173fe1c2]. The American Journal of Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Imaging plays a role in the management of patients with acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease. However, clinical circumstances strongly impact the appropriateness of imaging use. In patients with newly detected renal dysfunction, ultrasonography can assess for reversible causes, assess renal size and echogenicity, and thus, establish the chronicity of disease. Urinary obstruction can be detected, but imaging is most useful in high-risk groups or in patients in whom there is a strong clinical suspicion for obstruction. Computed tomography, computed tomography or magnetic resonance arteriography, and percutaneous ultrasound-guided renal biopsy are valuable in other clinical situations. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed every 3 years by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and review include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of a well-established consensus methodology (modified Delphi) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures by the panel. In those instances where evidence is lacking or not definitive, expert opinion may be used to recommend imaging or treatment.

### American college of radiology appropriateness criteria ®: a bibliometric analysis of panel members [^14ad6951]. Insights Into Imaging (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The use of imaging studies in medicine has dramatically increased over the past two decades. As patients receive medical care in multiple settings and hospitals, there is increased concern over ordering of imaging studies for indications that may not meet evidence-based guidelines. Previous studies have shown that 20–50% of all the advanced imaging studies performed do not make a significant difference in patient care. Clinical practice guidelines and education have been shown to be key factors in reducing low-value imaging. In 2016, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) recognized ACR as a "qualified Provider-Led Entity" (qPLE), approving the American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria® (ACR-AC) as the Medicare Appropriate Use Criteria (AUC). Through this provision, providers are required to make a documented AUC consult using a CMS qualified clinical decision support system (CDSS) prior to ordering advanced imaging investigations like CT, MRI, PET scan, etc. to fulfill the Protecting Access to Medicare Act (PAMA) requirements for reimbursement of these studies by Medicare. The ACR-AC are currently the most comprehensive national guidelines that aim to guide providers to use imaging modalities in the most appropriate and judicious manner and avoid inappropriate utilization of radiological imaging. The European Society of Radiology (ESR) also adapted the ACR criteria for use in the European clinical decision support (CDS) platform ESR iGuide.

The ACR-AC are developed and reviewed by "expert panels with leaders in radiology and other specialties". The methodology relies on combination of evidence, and when the data from scientific and technology assessment studies are insufficient, "expert consensus". As per the ACR, the methodology for evidence is based on the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach along with the National Institute of Medicine's publication "Clinical Practice Guidelines We Can Trust". The GRADE approach emphasizes grading the quality (or certainty) of evidence and strength of recommendations. GRADE recommends assessing the certainty in evidence for each important outcome using categories, and evidence summaries should be the basis for judgements about certainty in evidence and strength of recommendations. The ACR-AC provides recommendations in terms of appropriateness of imaging but does not provide the certainty in evidence for the readers. Lack of transparency about strength of evidence raises concern for dependence on the degree of "expert" opinion and consensus on the formulation of criteria.

### Meeting the needs of patient preferences in imaging [^785f334e]. Academic Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Healthcare continues to transition toward a patient-centered paradigm, where patients are active in medical decisions. Fully embracing this new paradigm means updating how clinical guidelines are formulated, accounting for patient preferences for medical care. Recently, several societies have incorporated patient preference evidence in their updated clinical practice guidelines, and patients in their expert panels. To fully transition to a patient-centered-paradigm, imaging organizations should rethink the formulation of clinical guidelines, accounting for patient preference evidence.

### Types of evidence needed to assess the clinical value of diagnostic imaging [^9e564b0f]. NEJM Evidence (2024). Medium credibility.

AbstractThe evidence underlying the use of advanced diagnostic imaging is based mainly on diagnostic accuracy studies and not on well-designed trials demonstrating improved patient outcomes. This has led to an expansion of low-value and potentially harmful patient care and raises ethical issues around the widespread implementation of tests with incompletely known benefits and harms. Randomized clinical trials are needed to support the safety and effectiveness of imaging tests and should be required for clearance of most new technologies. Large, diverse cohort studies are needed to quantify disease risk associated with many imaging findings, especially incidental findings, to enable evidence-based management. The responsibility to minimize the use of tests with unknown or low value requires engagement of clinicians, medical societies, and the public.

### Summary of the proceedings of the international forum 2016: "Imaging referral guidelines and clinical decision support-how can radiologists implement imaging referral guidelines in clinical routine? " [^21283565]. Insights Into Imaging (2017). Low credibility.

The use of high-tech diagnostic imaging procedures, like magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), positron emission tomography (PET), and nuclear cardiology tests, has seen double-digit increases annually in the last decade. While remarkable technological advances have enabled precise imaging of many complex physiologies and often ensure more accurate diagnostics, concerns are being raised that the sharp increase in these tests does not necessarily correspond proportionately to improved patient outcomes.

The ACR Appropriateness Criteria®, in existence for more than 20 years, define guidelines for the most appropriate medical imaging exam for a patient's condition, if any imaging is needed at all. These comprehensive criteria cover 215 topics and more than 1080 clinical indications. Appropriateness criteria use has been shown to improve quality, reduce unnecessary imaging and lower costs. They are widely accepted because they are created and continually updated by panels of physician experts from many different medical specialties. Implementation of a CDS system (CDSS) in the USA is needed because of the legal obligations, but the interest is considerable in other parts of the world.

The development of European guidelines started at the end of 2014, with the scientific review of ACR Select™ content by ESR experts and the adaptation of ACR appropriateness criteria to European standards of practice was performed. The process in Europe is developing quite fast. In the other parts of the world, the situation is diverse, but radiologists generally recognize advantages of imaging referral guidelines and CDS in clinical practice, but are also aware of potential drawbacks.

### Imaging and evaluation of patients with high-risk prostate cancer [^2766f45e]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2015). Medium credibility.

Approximately 15% of men with newly diagnosed prostate cancer have high-risk disease. Imaging is critically important for the diagnosis and staging of these patients, and also for the selection of management. While established prostate cancer staging guidelines have increased the appropriate use of imaging, underuse for high-risk prostate cancer remains substantial. Several factors affect the utility of initial diagnostic imaging, including the variable definition of high-risk prostate cancer, variable guideline recommendations, poor accuracy of existing imaging tests, and the difficulty in validating imaging findings. Conventional imaging modalities, including CT and radionuclide bone scan, have been employed for local and metastatic staging, but their performance characteristics have generally been poor. Emerging modalities including multiparametricMRI, positron emission tomography (PET)-CT, and PET-MRI have shown increased diagnostic accuracy and could improve accuracy in staging patients with high-risk prostate cancer.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® adrenal mass evaluation: 2021 update [^bd9f3315]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

The appropriate evaluation of adrenal masses is strongly dependent on the clinical circumstances in which it is discovered. Adrenal incidentalomas are masses that are discovered on imaging studies that have been obtained for purposes other than adrenal disease. Although the vast majority of adrenal incidentalomas are benign, further radiological and biochemical evaluation of these lesions is important to arrive at a specific diagnosis. Patients with a history of malignancy or symptoms of excess hormone require different imaging evaluations than patients with incidentalomas. This document reviews imaging approaches to adrenal masses and the various modalities utilized in evaluation of adrenal lesions. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Position statement and best practice recommendations on the imaging use of ultrasound from the European Society of Radiology ultrasound subcommittee [^2c9a3fb3]. Insights Into Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

Ultrasound is pivotal in diagnostic practice, often representing the initial imaging examination of patients. In this current era where radiology is anxious to enhance the "visibility" of the specialty to the general public, the opportunity for direct radiologist contact with patients during ultrasound examinations emphasises radiology as a clinical discipline, and demonstrates that it is the radiologist, not the machine, that makes the diagnosis.

It can be argued that a non-radiologist physician experienced in ultrasound is better able to correlate ultrasound findings with the patient's clinical symptoms and signs. However, it is precisely the radiologist's greater imaging experience, and their familiarity with other imaging modalities, with an appreciation of imaging anatomy, which may complete the diagnostic process that allows the achievement of a more accurate diagnosis, ultimately rendering a precise answer to the clinical question. It should be fully appreciated that the radiologist is not a "technician" but a clinical medical specialist with imaging expertise, perfectly capable of correlating images with the patient's clinical picture.

This document is intended as a best practice checklist for the provision of an ultrasound service that is "fit-for-purpose". Faced with growing discrepancies between ultrasound scanning methodologies, reporting processes for each body region, and the variable emphasis attributed by different operators to various aspects of ultrasound imaging, it was felt necessary to propose standardisation of ultrasound imaging examination technique, and to identify "standards" which anyone using the modality should observe.

Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2020). Medium credibility.

The American College of Cardiology (ACC) collaborated with the American Heart Association, American Society of Echocardiography, Heart Rhythm Society, International Society for Adult Congenital Heart Disease, Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions, Society of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography, Society for Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance, and the Society of Pediatric Echocardiography to develop Appropriate Use Criteria (AUC) for multimodality imaging during the follow-up care of patients with congenital heart disease (CHD). This is the first AUC to address cardiac imaging in adult and pediatric patients with established CHD. A number of common patient scenarios (also termed "indications") and associated assumptions and definitions were developed using guidelines, clinical trial data, and expert opinion in the field of CHD. 1 The indications relate primarily to evaluation before and after cardiac surgery or catheter-based intervention, and they address routine surveillance as well as evaluation of new-onset signs or symptoms. The writing group developed 324 clinical indications, which they separated into 19 tables according to the type of cardiac lesion. Noninvasive cardiac imaging modalities that could potentially be used for these indications were incorporated into the tables, resulting in a total of 1,035 unique scenarios. These scenarios were presented to a separate, independent panel for rating, with each being scored on a scale of 1 to 9, with 1 to 3 categorized as "Rarely Appropriate", 4 to 6 as "May Be Appropriate", and 7 to 9 as "Appropriate". Forty-four percent of the scenarios were rated as Appropriate, 39% as May Be Appropriate, and 17% as Rarely Appropriate. This AUC document will provide guidance to clinicians in the care of patients with established CHD by identifying the reasonable imaging modality options available for evaluation and surveillance of such patients. It will also serve as an educational and quality improvement tool to identify patterns of care and reduce the number of Rarely Appropriate tests in clinical practice.

With the ability to noninvasively image and monitor molecular processes within tumors, molecular imaging represents a fundamental tool for cancer scientists. In the current review, we describe emergent optical technologies for molecular imaging. We aim to provide the reader with an overview of the fundamental principles on which each imaging strategy is based, to introduce established and future applications, and to provide a rationale for selecting optical technologies for molecular imaging depending on disease location, biology, and anatomy. To accelerate clinical translation of imaging techniques, we also describe examples of practical applications in patients. Elevating these techniques into standard-of-care tools will transform patient stratification, disease monitoring, and response evaluation.

Congenital heart disease follow-up imaging — availability, alternatives, and risk — notes that use of imaging modalities may be influenced by local availability of technology and qualified professional staff, but that the level of appropriateness does not consider issues of local availability or expertise for a given modality. X-ray angiography during cardiac catheterization has been excluded from this document, and when a modality has known limitations, alternative modalities should be considered and may take precedence on the basis of the clinician's judgment. Comprehensive risk assessment is assumed, including combined and cumulative risks of anesthesia, vascular access, contrast agents, and radiation exposure; anesthesia risk includes the potential for adverse long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes, vascular access for noninvasive imaging via peripheral intravenous catheter insertion has been shown to be safe in patients of all ages with a low rate of complications such as extravasation, contrast agent risks include allergic reaction or renal toxicity from iodinated agents and nephrogenic systemic fibrosis and the undefined risk of neuronal deposition with gadolinium-based agents, and radiation exposure in children has been linked to later development of cancer.

Joint replacement procedures have improved dramatically during the past 30 years fueled by the changes in techniques for hips and knees. Joint replacements in other anatomic regions also have become more popular. It is essential to understand the importance of pre- and postoperative imaging for evaluating patients. Preoperative images are used in concert with clinical data to select the appropriate patients and components. Postoperative imaging is critical for evaluating position and potential complications. Appropriate selection of imaging modalities is essential to provide optimal, cost-effective patient care.

Cardiovascular imaging case selection — To reduce radiation exposure, "the most effective way to reduce patient radiation exposure is not to perform the radiation-based procedure altogether"; a radiation-based procedure should be used only when it is the preferred choice among alternative modalities that do not involve radiation exposure, and if equivalent diagnostic information can be obtained by the alternative imaging modality, that study should be selected in preference to a radiation-based procedure, which is particularly important in children and adolescents. It is critical to utilize appropriate use criteria, and when choosing between a radiation-based modality and one that does not use ionizing radiation, one must weigh both the clinical efficacy, including sensitivity and specificity of each alternative modality, and importance of the risk to the particular patient conferred by the radiation exposure, while not withholding appropriate studies due to undue concern of the radiation-related risk.

### Guidelines: congress of neurological surgeons systematic review and evidence-based guideline for the diagnosis of patients with positional plagiocephaly: the role of imaging [^e63eda74]. Neurosurgery (2016). Low credibility.

Background

No evidence-based guidelines exist for the imaging of patients with positional plagiocephaly.

Objective

The objective of this systematic review and evidence-based guideline is to answer the question, Is imaging necessary for infants with positional plagiocephaly to make a diagnosis?

Methods

The National Library of Medicine Medline database and the Cochrane Library were queried with the use of MeSH headings and key words relevant to imaging as a means to diagnose plagiocephaly. Abstracts were reviewed, and an evidentiary table was assembled summarizing the studies and the quality of evidence (Classes I-III). Based on the quality of the literature, a recommendation was rendered (Level I, II, or III).

Results

A total of 42 full-text articles were selected for review. Of these, 10 were eliminated; thus, 32 full-text were manuscripts selected. There was no Class I evidence, but 2 Class II and 30 Class III studies were included. Three-dimensional cranial topographical imaging, ultrasound, skull x-rays, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging were investigated.

Conclusion

Clinical examination is most often sufficient to diagnose plagiocephaly (quality, Class III; strength, Level III). Within the limits of this systematic review, the evidence suggests that imaging is rarely necessary and should be reserved for cases in which the clinical examination is equivocal. Many of the imaging studies were not designed to address the diagnostic utility of the imaging modality, and authors were actually assessing the utility of the imaging in longitudinal follow-up, not initial diagnosis. For this reason, some of the studies reviewed were downgraded in Level of Evidence. When needed, 3-dimensional cranial topographical photo, skull x-rays, or ultrasound imaging is almost always sufficient for definitive diagnosis. Computed tomography scanning should not be used to diagnose plagiocephaly, but it may be necessary to rule out craniosynostosis.

### Summary of the proceedings of the international forum 2016: "Imaging referral guidelines and clinical decision support-how can radiologists implement imaging referral guidelines in clinical routine? " [^d2a45113]. Insights Into Imaging (2017). Low credibility.

The situation in India

O.P. Bansal presented the situation in India and the point of view of the IRIA.

Dr. Bansal pointed out that the duty of radiologists is to provide safe patient care services which improve the outcome of the patient. The IRIA is in line with other organizations with regard to imaging referral guidelines for radiologists, and believe they are needed because of the overuse and inappropriate use of imaging, increasing costs and radiation exposure risks. The IRIA also recognizes that some of its members may find aspects of imaging referral guidelines challenging in the current scenario. The guidelines should assist them to address the challenges, and to achieve the common goal of ensuring that primary care has proper access to high-quality imaging services as a negative investigation can exclude disease and put the patient at risk. Criteria for developing guidelines should take into account modality and age, issues of optimizing radiation dose and cost-effectiveness. Imaging technique guidelines are needed for different modalities, and also for different clinical situations, as well as for reporting.

The referral pattern in India is such that the treating physician refers the case to the radiologist with a request to carry out a specific diagnostic investigation. Generally, the case is not discussed with the radiologist prior to sending the patient to decide the appropriate modality of investigation. The radiologist generally carries out the investigation desired by the physician and writes a report; recommendations regarding further investigations are also given, if required. The IRIA has nominated academics of repute as heads of various subspecialties, who were asked to prepare a white paper regarding imaging guidelines for various common clinical scenarios prevalent in Indian settings. The academic wing of the IRIA is engaged in formulating imaging guidelines for a wide variety of conditions and there is a regular interaction between the referring clinician and the radiologist by inviting them to various conferences and CME organized by the IRIA to make them aware of the recent advances in radiology and help them to choose the appropriate investigation in a given clinical setting.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® preprocedural planning for left atrial procedures in atrial fibrillation [^e2879a95]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

This document summarizes the relevant literature for the selection of preprocedural imaging in three clinical scenarios in patients needing endovascular treatment or cardioversion of atrial fibrillation. These clinical scenarios include preprocedural imaging prior to radiofrequency ablation; prior to left atrial appendage occlusion; and prior to cardioversion. The appropriateness of imaging modalities as they apply to each clinical scenario is rated as usually appropriate, may be appropriate, and usually not appropriate to assist the selection of the most appropriate imaging modality in the corresponding clinical scenarios. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

### Updated appropriate use criteria for amyloid and tau PET: a report from the Alzheimer's association and society for nuclear medicine and molecular imaging workgroup [^e818f31c]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

The decision to pursue amyloid or tau PET should result from shared decision making between the ordering clinician, patient, and family and should take into account the patient's and family's desire to know the amyloid/tau status in light of each possible test outcome (including positive, negative, or indeterminate results). Although current data, obtained primarily in research settings, suggest that amyloid PET results can be disclosed safely and do not typically cause psychological harm, the individual mental health circumstances and support networks of the imaging candidate should be considered. Finally, as insurance coverage for amyloid and tau PET remains uncertain for many patients, the decision‐making process should address the potential for co‐payment and other out‐of‐pocket costs.

Although the workgroup sought to highlight the most common clinical scenarios under which amyloid and tau PET may be considered, a limited number of standardized scenarios can never capture the heterogeneity of patients in clinical practice, nor convey the complexity of clinical decision making for individual patients. Therefore, the criteria presented here should be considered as guidelines for clinicians, but not as a substitute for careful clinician judgment that considers the full clinical context for each patient who presents with cognitive complaints. In developing the scenarios, the workgroup considered the degree to which PET results would inform patient diagnosis and care from the available literature most relevant to the scenario's clinical circumstance.

8.3 Clinical scenarios and appropriateness ratings for amyloid and tau PET IMAGING

The appropriateness scores (based on majority vote on the appropriateness scale at the conclusion of the Delphi process) for each clinical scenario are presented in Table 2. The overall categorizations of each scenario as appropriate, uncertain, or rarely appropriate for each modality are presented in Table 3. It is important to note that each of the ratings for the clinical scenarios presented below reflect the level of appropriate use of each modality by itself: amyloid imaging independent or in the absence of tau imaging, and tau imaging independent or in the absence of amyloid imaging. The use of both modalities in combination is discussed later in the document (see Section 9: Value of Tau PET Imaging in Combination with Amyloid PET Imaging). In addition, although several studies have evaluated the clinical impact of amyloid PET, there is a paucity of data about clinical uses of tau PET, which to date has primarily been used in research studies. As a result, workgroup recommendations regarding tau PET were often based on expert opinion and are not yet supported by empirical evidence. Therefore, the workgroup generally had lower confidence in the appropriateness of tau PET in most scenarios.

### 2021 AHA / ACC / ASE / CHEST / SAEM / SCCT / SCMR guideline for the evaluation and diagnosis of chest pain: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^479e5302]. Journal of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography (2021). High credibility.

Chest pain diagnostic modality selection — age, obesity, and exercise capacity guide test choice: Patients ≥ 65 years of age have a higher likelihood of ischemia and obstructive coronary artery disease, and contemporary randomized trials support that candidates for elective coronary angiography may be safely triaged using coronary computed tomographic angiography (CCTA) or noninvasive testing. Imaging of obese patients, especially those with morbid obesity (body mass index > 40), can be challenging and requires careful consideration of available equipment. In patients selected for stress imaging who are able to exercise, exercise testing is preferred over pharmacologic stress to improve diagnostic and prognostic information. Although positron emission tomography (PET) and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) are grouped together, PET has improved diagnostic and prognostic performance, especially when quantitative assessment of myocardial blood flow (MBF) can be performed. Irrespective of the test performed, an overarching goal is to identify those who would benefit from guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT), and the patient should be engaged in a process of shared decision-making before determining the final choice of the cardiac test modality and in guiding the pathway for treatment decisions.

### 2013 appropriate utilization of cardiovascular imaging: a methodology for the development of joint criteria for the appropriate utilization of cardiovascular imaging by the American college of cardiology foundation and American college of radiology [^b6ab9daf]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2013). Low credibility.

The American College of Radiology (ACR) and the American College of Cardiology Foundation (ACCF) have jointly developed a method to define appropriate utilization of cardiovascular imaging. The primary role of this method is to create a series of documents to define the utility of cardiovascular imaging procedures in relation to specific clinical questions, with the aim of defining what, if any, imaging tests are indicated to help to determine diagnosis, treatment, or outcome. The methodology accomplishes this aim through the application of systematic evidence reviews integrated with expert opinion by means of a rigorous Delphi process. By obtaining broad input during the development process from radiologists, cardiologists, primary care physicians, and other stakeholders, these documents are intended to provide practical evidence-based guidance to ordering providers, imaging laboratories, interpreting physicians, patients, and policymakers as to optimal cardiovascular imaging utilization. This document details the history, rationale, and methodology for developing these joint documents for appropriate utilization of cardiovascular imaging.

### Evaluating acute image ordering for real-world patient cases via language model alignment with radiological guidelines [^e9e57d6b]. Communications Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Ordering diagnostic imaging studies is an increasingly common task in the emergency department (ED) and other acute-care settings, and is associated with high cognitive burden for clinicians –. While diagnostic imaging can play a crucial role in the acute workup of patients, ordering imaging studies with limited clinical utility has raised concerns regarding resource utilization, radiation exposure, and financial burden to both patients and healthcare systems –. Recent estimates suggest that up to 30% of diagnostic imaging studies ordered in the ED setting could be replaced with more appropriate alternatives at the time the order was placed.

Multiple factors contribute to the challenge of ordering appropriate and clinically indicated imaging studies. Importantly, emergency medicine physicians often need to make rapid diagnostic decisions with limited clinical context while simultaneously managing high patient volumes and complex patient presentations. Furthermore, there is considerable variability between healthcare providers in imaging ordering patterns: recent studies have documented significant differences in the utilization rates of different imaging studies between individual emergency physicians, suggesting that factors beyond strict clinical necessity influence imaging decisions –.

To help clinicians make more informed, evidence-based decisions in image ordering and simultaneously address inter-provider variability in imaging practices, the American College of Radiology (ACR) released the ACR Appropriateness Criteria® (ACR AC), which are a set of evidence-based guidelines that assist referring physicians in ordering the most appropriate diagnostic imaging studies for specific clinical conditions. As of June 2024, the ACR AC contains 224 unique imaging topics (i.e. patient scenarios).

However, despite the widespread availability of the ACR AC, low utilization of these guidelines remains a challenge in many emergency departments and inpatient settings. Bautista et al. showed that there is low utilization of the ACR AC by clinicians in practice: less than 1% of physicians interviewed in their study use the ACR AC as a first-line resource when ordering diagnostic imaging studies. The limited usage of the ACR AC may be partly due to how the Appropriateness Criteria are made accessible to clinicians; the evidence-based criteria are dense and can be difficult to interpret even for physician experts — especially in acute healthcare settings such as the emergency department where decision making is both time-sensitive and critical.

### Imaging for planning of cardiac resynchronization therapy [^c6cb159c]. JACC: Cardiovascular Imaging (2012). Low credibility.

Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is a novel therapy for patients with refractory heart failure (HF). Large clinical trials evaluating CRT have demonstrated significant improvements in cardiac survival, decreases in recurrent HF hospitalization, and improvements in indexes of quality of life. Although numerous mechanisms are involved in CRT's therapeutic effects, correction of both interventricular and intraventricular mechanical dyssynchrony has been postulated as the key mechanism. To date, most large randomized controlled trials evaluating CRT have identified dyssynchronous patients on the basis of prolongation of the QRS complex from the baseline electrocardiogram. Concerns have been raised regarding the use of this measure for patient selection, stemming from a significant 30% to 40% nonresponse rate to CRT. Because of the cost and invasive nature of CRT, optimal patient selection for this therapy has become a priority for HF specialists and electrophysiologists. Cardiac imaging modalities have attempted to fulfill this need to improve patient selection by identifying mechanical dyssynchrony. Although early echocardiographic studies reported promising results, more recent larger scale studies have curtailed this enthusiasm, with a lack of established selection criteria for CRT in the current practice guidelines. This review summarizes the evidence to date and the potential role of imaging modalities in the selection and care of patients with HF referred for CRT.

### Imaging in locoregional management of breast cancer [^1e46dd01]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2020). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, diagnostic imaging methods are tools that can help improve treatment decisions. The impact of these tools on improved patient care depends not only on the diagnostic accuracy of the respective method but also on the expertise of the multidisciplinary team that incorporates the tools into practice. Breast radiologists and surgeons, as well as medical and radiation oncologists, have the opportunity to embrace contemporary imaging in clinical care and treatment trials to support personalized treatment of the diverse spectrum of BC. A number of ongoing and future trials, along with existing evidence on how to appropriately use available methods of precision imaging, will refine the role of imaging in breast cancer to optimize the locoregional management and quality of life in women diagnosed with BC.

### The role of chest imaging in patient management during the COVID-19 pandemic: a multinational consensus statement from the Fleischner society [^316e914f]. Chest (2020). High credibility.

Fleischner Society COVID-19 imaging — main recommendations: Imaging is not routinely indicated as a screening test for COVID-19 in asymptomatic individuals. Imaging is not indicated for patients with mild features of COVID-19 unless they are at risk for disease progression (scenario 1). Imaging is indicated for patients with moderate to severe features of COVID-19 regardless of COVID-19 test results (scenarios 2 and 3). Imaging is indicated for patients with COVID-19 and evidence of worsening respiratory status (scenarios 1, 2, and 3). In a resource-constrained environment where access to computed tomography (CT) is limited, chest radiography may be preferred for patients with COVID-19 unless features of respiratory worsening warrant the use of CT (scenarios 2 and 3).

### European Association of Urology guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of urolithiasis [^6a14fa8d]. European Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Objective

The European Association of Urology urolithiasis guidelines provide evidence-based recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of urinary stone disease. Given the complexity and variability of stone formation, individualised patient management is emphasised.

Methods

The guidelines incorporate evidence from the latest research and focus on risk assessment, imaging techniques, pharmacological management, and surgical interventions. A research librarian conducted literature searches for urolithiasis in the Cochrane Library, Medline, and Embase databases via Dialog-Datastar. The strength of recommendations is also rated.

Key Findings and Limitations

Diagnosis relies on a combination of clinical history, biochemical evaluation, and imaging, with ultrasound as the first-line modality and low-dose computed tomography as the gold standard for precise stone assessment. Stone composition and burden influence treatment decisions with algorithms primarily based on stone size, location, and composition. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are recommended for first-line pain management, with opioids reserved as a secondary option. Medical expulsive therapy with α-blockers may be considered for selected patients with ureteral stones. Extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy, ureteroscopy, and percutaneous nephrolithotomy remain the primary intervention modalities, with selection based on stone characteristics and patient factors. Advances in multiplanar imaging have improved assessment of the stone burden, although further research is needed to refine predictive models. Genetic testing is recommended for high-risk patients to guide personalised treatment.

Conclusions and Clinical Implications

The guidelines provide a framework for clinical decision-making while acknowledging the need for continued advances in urolithiasis.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2020). High credibility.

Congenital heart disease follow-up imaging — modality assumptions — explains that although the document examines imaging modalities in specific scenarios, it does not address the specific techniques associated with each modality and assumes that a comprehensive transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) examination may include 2-dimensional, 3-dimensional, M-mode, and strain imaging; color, spectral, and tissue Doppler imaging; and use of contrast agents for opacification, when applicable. The document defines stress imaging to include echocardiography and myocardial perfusion imaging performed with exercise or pharmacological stress designed to provoke ischemia, may also refer to echocardiography performed with exercise or dobutamine to assess the severity of valvular or outflow tract obstruction or changes in Doppler-derived RV pressure estimates, specifies that these tests should be considered under stress imaging rather than the underlying modality, and notes that other diagnostic tests such as electrocardiography, chest x-ray, and imaging of noncardiovascular structures are not addressed.

### Best practices guidelines in imaging [^8117d2d2]. ACS (2018). Medium credibility.

Radiation exposure — radiation exposure remains a factor in determining the best utilization of MDCT imaging, and MDCT technology dose-adjusting software based on body region, patient body habitus, and iterative reconstruction methodologies has reduced radiation exposure significantly on modern scanners. The potential deleterious impact of radiation exposure is of greatest concern for pediatric and pregnant patient populations, and close cooperation with the radiologist for proper technique adjustment is encouraged. Expert consensus currently does not specify a definitive lifetime risk for malignancy, though it is likely to be exceedingly small, and providers need to understand this issue and balance the diminutive risk of exposure against the risk from potential missed or delayed diagnosis. Bedside ultrasound is a portable non-ionizing imaging modality with limited utility in the stable trauma patient but may be helpful in the unstable patient, and alternative non-ionizing modalities such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) carry significant inherent risks including remote transport for imaging, frequent requirement for sedation, limited availability for patient monitoring and resuscitation, and longer acquisition times.

### Making the best value of clinical radiology: iRefer guidelines, 8th edition [^3b147fa7]. Clinical Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

New uses of medical imaging as well as over-diagnosis and wasteful imaging have led to a 10% per annum growth in computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Personalised value to the patient will be helped by referral guidelines for the best test first, adding evidence-based technical value to the investigation to answer the clinical question, thus providing allocative value to the commissioners of medical imaging. Appropriate imaging is driven by the need for effective decisions, radiation safety, and cost awareness. The eighth edition of The Royal College of Radiologists' iRefer guidelines addresses 270 common clinical settings providing imaging referral advice, particularly for primary care practitioners. There is a new section addressing asymptomatic individuals for screening and health assessment. Multiple formats, including print and web formats, will be augmented by a clinical decision support tool to bring guidance closer to referrers. Established evidence identified a reduction in requested examination numbers by typically 20%, with more recent studies showing appropriate imaging in 80–90% of cases, correctly allowing some flexibility for individual circumstances. The perceived value of referral guidance may be judged by the mandated use in the USA, the requirement for availability in Europe, and the wish by many elsewhere to avail their patients of best imaging practice.

### Imaging-based screening: maximizing benefits and minimizing harms [^0f9f1fe2]. Clinical Imaging (2015). Low credibility.

Advanced imaging technologies play a central role in screening asymptomatic patients. However, the balance between imaging-based screening's potential benefits versus risks is sometimes unclear. Radiologists will have to address ongoing concerns, including high false-positive rates, incidental findings outside the organ of interest, overdiagnosis, and potential risks from radiation exposure. In this article, we provide a brief overview of these recurring controversies and suggest the following as areas that radiologists should focus on in order to tip the balance toward more benefits and less harms for patients undergoing imaging-based screening: interpretive variability, abnormal finding thresholds, and personalized, risk-based screening.

### Radiation safety in children with congenital and acquired heart disease: a scientific position statement on multimodality dose optimization from the image gently alliance [^7ac11ef3]. JACC: Cardiovascular Imaging (2017). Low credibility.

OPTIMIZATION AND JUSTIFICATION

The principles of justification and optimization form the backbone of medical imaging dose management recommendations. Justification, when discussed in the context of the individual patient, suggests that a medical procedure is both appropriately indicated and that the anticipated clinical benefits exceed all anticipated risks, including radiation risk. In adult cardiology, where there are established appropriate use criteria, a significant percentage (from ~5% to > 45%, depending on the study and imaging modality) of cardiac imaging studies has questionable justification. Similar appropriate use criteria have not been developed for pediatric cardiac imaging procedures that utilize ionizing radiation, and it is unclear what proportion of medical imaging procedures would generally be considered justified in these patients. Justification is an indispensable part of radiation protection in children, on the basis of the ethical principles of nonmaleficence and beneficence.

As defined in the preceding text, optimization entails that the radiation dose to the patient is suitable for the intended medical purpose, and radiation that is clinically unnecessary or unproductive is avoided. Regardless of the imaging modality, optimization strategies almost always vary depending on the patient size or body habitus. Strategies for dose optimization in adults typically cannot simply be applied to children. For practitioners engaged in pediatric medical imaging procedures that use ionizing radiation, it is necessary to understand the unique needs of children and the challenges of optimized imaging across the spectrum of pediatric patients from the premature neonate to the adult-sized adolescent.

### Approaches to enhancing radiation safety in cardiovascular imaging: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^dadc068b]. Circulation (2014). Medium credibility.

Optimization — cardiac imaging with ionizing radiation emphasizes that once a cardiac imaging study is deemed appropriate and clinically necessary, the study should be performed in a manner that minimizes radiation exposure while maintaining high diagnostic accuracy, and patients should be exposed to the amount of radiation necessary to produce images adequate for the clinical purpose, but not substantially more or less. Justification is highlighted, as a determination of the appropriateness of imaging is the first, cardinal step, and even if cardiac imaging with ionizing radiation is appropriate, there may be comparable diagnostic tests without radiation, and in some patients, this may be the preferred approach, especially in younger patients in whom the projected lifetime attributable risk of radiogenic cancer is higher. Appropriate use criteria (AUC) can only serve as a tool for promoting appropriate use and limiting inappropriate use of procedures if they are meaningfully integrated into clinical decision making.

### Defining and measuring imaging appropriateness in low back pain studies: a scoping review [^c65c6998]. European Spine Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Patients with low back pain (LBP) rarely have serious underlying pathology but frequently undergo inappropriate imaging. A range of guidelines and red flag features are utilised to characterise appropriate imaging. This scoping review explores how LBP imaging appropriateness is determined and calculated in studies of primary care practice.

Methods

This scoping review builds upon a previous meta-analysis, incorporating articles identified that were published since 2014, with an updated search to capture articles published since the original search. Electronic databases were searched, and citation lists of included papers were reviewed. Inclusion criteria were studies assessing adult LBP imaging appropriateness in a primary care setting. Twenty-three eligible studies were identified.

Results

A range of red flag features were utilised to determine imaging appropriateness. Most studies considered appropriateness in a binary manner, by the presence of any red flag feature. Ten guidelines were referenced, with 7/23 (30%) included studies amending or not referencing any guideline. The method for calculating the proportion of inappropriate imaging varied. Ten per cent of the studies used the total number of patients presenting with LBP as the denominator, suggesting most studies overestimated the rate of inappropriate imaging, and did not capture where imaging is not performed for clinically suspicious LBP.

Conclusion

Greater clarity is needed on how we define and measure imaging appropriateness for LBP, which also accounts for the problem of failing to image when indicated. An internationally agreed methodology for imaging appropriateness studies would ultimately lead to an improvement in the care delivered to patients.

### Imaging algorithm for COVID-19: a practical approach [^be5cf7d9]. Clinical Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

The global pandemic of COVID-19 pneumonia caused by the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has strained healthcare resources across the world with emerging challenges of mass testing, resource allocation and management. While reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test is the most commonly utilized test and considered the current gold standard for diagnosis, the role of chest imaging has been highlighted by several studies demonstrating high sensitivity of computed tomography (CT). Many have suggested using CT chest as a first-line screening tool for the diagnosis of COVID-19. However, with advancement of laboratory testing and challenges in obtaining a CT scan without significant risk to healthcare providers, the role of imaging in diagnosis has been questioned. Several imaging societies have released consensus statements and guidelines on utilizing imaging resources and optimal reporting. In this review, we highlight the current evidence on various modalities in thoracic imaging for the diagnosis of COVID-19 and describe an algorithm on how to use these resources in an optimal fashion in accordance with the guidelines and statements released by major imaging societies.

### Knowledge translation and barriers to imaging optimization in the emergency department: a research agenda [^ad89ed39]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Researchers have attempted to optimize imaging utilization by describing which clinical variables are more predictive of acute disease and, conversely, what combination of variables can obviate the need for imaging. These results are then used to develop evidence-based clinical pathways, clinical decision instruments, and clinical practice guidelines. Despite the validation of these results in subsequent studies, with some demonstrating improved outcomes, their actual use is often limited. This article outlines a research agenda to promote the dissemination and implementation (also known as knowledge translation) of evidence-based interventions for emergency department (ED) imaging, i.e., clinical pathways, clinical decision instruments, and clinical practice guidelines. We convened a multidisciplinary group of stakeholders and held online and telephone discussions over a 6-month period culminating in an in-person meeting at the 2015 Academic Emergency Medicine consensus conference. We identified the following four overarching research questions: 1) what determinants (barriers and facilitators) influence emergency physicians' use of evidence-based interventions when ordering imaging in the ED; 2) what implementation strategies at the institutional level can improve the use of evidence-based interventions for ED imaging; 3) what interventions at the health care policy level can facilitate the adoption of evidence-based interventions for ED imaging; and 4) how can health information technology, including electronic health records, clinical decision support, and health information exchanges, be used to increase awareness, use, and adherence to evidence-based interventions for ED imaging? Advancing research that addresses these questions will provide valuable information as to how we can use evidence-based interventions to optimize imaging utilization and ultimately improve patient care.

### Impact and effect of imaging referral guidelines on patients and radiology services: a systematic review [^7f46198e]. European Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Furthermore, the existing imaging referral guidelines do not address several common clinical scenarios. Similarly, the guidelines for paediatric imaging lacked coverage in two-thirds of clinical scenarios involving children. Indeed, the lack of coverage in the guidelines, for instance, for patients with neoplasm, might result in cases classified as 'Not included in the guideline' instead of 'Appropriate' or 'Inappropriate'. In such situations, it may be necessary to follow local protocols and consensus, or defer to expert opinion when there is a lack of evidence or ambiguity. These underlying issues could have implications for systemic use.

There were also substantial numbers of imaging referral guidelines supported by expert opinion, whereas a smaller number were based on evidence from well-designed randomised controlled trials or high-quality meta-analyses. According to Sardanelli et al, "strong evidence does not always produce a strong recommendation"; this notion can hinder the optimisation of the advantages provided by guidelines. The basis of expert opinion, together with the sum of evidence, can result in a variation of opinion. These differences may cause challenges in the acceptance of imaging referral guidelines by referring clinicians or even among radiologists.

Although the studies that were included did not specifically explore the effects of imaging referral guidelines on healthcare sustainability, there exists a potential for the radiology field to actively contribute to healthcare sustainability through this intervention. In their study, Alshqaqeeq et al examined the application of ACR appropriateness criteria as an approach to mitigating hospital energy consumption and identified imaging modalities that have a reduced environmental impact while maintaining the same level of patient care quality. The findings of the study align with the conclusions reported by McAlister et al who conducted a study into the carbon footprint associated with hospital diagnostic imaging in Australia. Their findings indicate that clinicians have the potential to reduce carbon emissions from diagnostic imaging through two primary strategies: firstly, by minimising the incidence of ordering unnecessary imaging procedures; and secondly, by selecting low-impact imaging modalities such as X-ray and ultrasound instead of high-impact options like MRI and CT, but only when it is clinically appropriate.

### Advanced image analysis to select patients for prostate specific membrane antigen radioligand therapy and assess treatment response [^e2eab4a1]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this case series we have presented an image analysis tool that provides quantitative information not readily available in most clinical settings. This tool can quantify PET images on both a patient-level and individual metastasis level, compare images of different modalities to assess concordance/discordance between modalities (eg, between CT and PET or PSMA PET and FDG PET), and compare sequential PET images to assess treatment response both qualitatively and quantitatively. As a supplement and with confirmation from clinical PET imaging review, the consolidation of information in this image analysis report, particularly quantitative data, can greatly aid in clinical decision making for patients being treated with radiopharmaceutical therapies, including selecting patients most appropriate for therapy and quantitatively assessing treatment response.

The first 2 cases demonstrate the ability of this tool to help select patients appropriate for PSMA-directed radiopharmaceutical therapy. The SUV mean on a patient level is known to be a predictive marker of response to PSMA-directed radiopharmaceutical therapy, but is difficult to measure on a practical, reproducible and repeatable fashion across many scanners, readers, and institutions. The TRAQinform IQ tool readily provides this metric, and in the 2 cases here the SUV mean proved predictive of the patients' responses to therapy. TRAQinform IQ also provides individual lesion SUV mean values. This will be critical as a tool to identify specific metastases that may not respond, and that warrant extra attention on follow-up and possibly additional interventions, particularly as nonresponding lesions have the potential to drive overall progression.

### 2022 ACC / AHA guideline for the diagnosis and management of aortic Disease: a report of the American Heart Association / American college of cardiology joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^26c6dc09]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

Aortic imaging modalities and selection considerations — synopsis and supportive measurement guidance emphasize protocolized imaging and modality choice. Optimized depiction of aortic anatomy and pathology requires dedicated aortic imaging protocols, and computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) and transesophageal echocardiography (TEE), and abdominal aortic ultrasound all have important roles in these evaluations. Selection of an imaging modality may be based on patient-specific factors, including hemodynamic stability, contrast allergy, renal function, and patient tolerance (eg, given relatively longer examination times and the confined space associated with MRI, occasionally requiring sedation), and the institutional availability of an imaging modality or an expert imaging physician may also direct modality selection. The ubiquity of CT scanners, combined with rapid acquisition of intuitive, high-resolution 3-dimensional (3D) imaging data sets, has led to the wide adoption of this modality for the assessment of suspected aortic pathology and for periprocedural vascular evaluation, in most cases supplanting diagnostic catheter angiography. Measurements should be obtained perpendicular to the long axis of the aorta at specified segmental locations, with measurements also taken at the locations of any abnormalities, and if a 3D data set has been acquired, dedicated multiplanar reformats orthogonal to aortic flow axis should be created at each level of measurement.

### Personalized versus evidence-based medicine with PET-based imaging [^e0eb4b60]. Nature Reviews: Clinical Oncology (2010). Medium credibility.

In this Perspective the feasibility, scope and impact of integrating PET-based personalized medicine into the evidence-based clinical practice of oncology is discussed. The basic concepts of 'evidence-based medicine' and 'personalized medicine' at times seem contradictory; however, I will discuss, with specific clinical situations as examples, a synergistic and probably incremental link between the two and propose that the result of such integration will ultimately improve patient management. Tailoring therapeutic approaches and regimens by molecular imaging, with PET at its forefront, would enable disease management at the individual level and this modification would hopefully further strengthen the evidence-based approach in oncology.

### Measuring appropriateness of diagnostic imaging: a scoping review [^9e07db2d]. Insights Into Imaging (2023). Medium credibility.

Our review also has some limitations. Firstly, as with most scoping reviews, our analysis focused on the big picture with a high degree of aggregation and as a result, we may have missed specific details related to examinations that were rated as "maybe appropriate". Secondly, certain factors that could be associated with appropriateness, such as the quality of referrals, the nature of the disease (acute or chronic), and the type of disease or symptoms were not analyzed.

This review revealed heterogeneities in current evidence concerning study design, statistical methods, reporting and the appropriateness rating itself. This results in challenges regarding the appraisal of study validity due to small sample sizes, conflicting results and lack of reporting. Therefore, the following needs for further research and clinical practice can be derived from this review:
An inevitable prerequisite for the measurement of appropriateness rates are evidence-based guidelines. Most studies used clinical data to assess the appropriateness of an imaging procedure. So far, clinical data entail difficulties as they are not standardised. As a consequence, clinical data sets are hard to compare within a single study and especially over several studies. Structured data might be a way forward to gain comparability and transparency. Furthermore, structured data or at least automated data are the very basis for intelligent tools like clinical decision support, which is requested by radiological societies such as the ESR.
A clear methodological pathway is needed for the measurement of appropriateness rates to obtain more valid data. In this review a high percentage of individual expert opinions were used to define appropriateness. International comparisons of appropriateness rates are impaired by the usage of different national guidelines.
Thresholds should be defined while creating certain guidelines to establish awareness for both, the referrer and the radiologist. This could be applied to guidelines for very common indications. To discover applicable numbers, single and specific indications need to be subject of further studies. The design of these studies should include a large number of patients and elaborate specific key performance indicators for different modalities.

Based on this standardization, national audits as well as benchmarking of appropriateness in diagnostic imaging might be feasible. In summary, the following methodological standards should be met in future research or audits about imaging appropriateness to achieve a high level of evidence:
Implementation of multicentric studies, preferably with randomized controlled or interventional design;
Focus on clinical picture, not body regions, to create an inference to specific guidelines;
Consideration of the presence and quality of referrals for diagnostic imaging, as well as the existence of preliminary examinations;
Double independent readings of appropriateness;
High transparency regarding the rating results;
Analytical statistics with clearly defined influencing factors.

### Measuring appropriateness of diagnostic imaging: a scoping review [^ebfee7d0]. Insights Into Imaging (2023). Medium credibility.

In radiology, the justification of diagnostic imaging is a key performance indicator. To date, specific recommendations on the measurement of appropriateness in diagnostic imaging are missing. To map the study literature concerning the definition, measures, methods and data used for analyses of appropriateness in research of diagnostic imaging. We conducted a scoping review in Medline, EMBASE, Scopus and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Two independent reviewers undertook screening and data extraction. After screening 6021 records, we included 50 studies. National guidelines (n = 22/50) or American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria (n = 23/50) were used to define and rate appropriateness. 22/50 studies did not provide methodological details about the appropriateness assessment. The included studies varied concerning modality, amount of reviewed examinations (88–13,941) and body regions. Computed tomography (27 studies, 27,168 examinations) was the most frequently analyzed modality, followed by magnetic resonance imaging (17 studies, 6559 examinations) and radiography (10 studies, 7095 examinations). Heterogeneous appropriateness rates throughout single studies (0–100%), modalities, and body regions (17–95%) were found. Research on pediatric and outpatient imaging was sparse. Multicentric, methodologically robust and indication-oriented studies would strengthen appropriateness research in diagnostic imaging and help to develop reliable key performance indicators.

D. Limitations — scope and evidence base: The document acknowledges limitations, noting that recommendations for groups of clinical scenarios may not fit individual situations and may therefore require deviation from proposed decision trees. It further states that published data are limited and based on relatively small, single-center experience with a lack of large randomized prospective trials, and that the clinical presentation, diagnostic considerations, and therapeutic interventions described would apply only in part to care of patients in developed countries and not necessarily developing countries.
