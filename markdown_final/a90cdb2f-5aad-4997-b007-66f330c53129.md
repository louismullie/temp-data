Sudden deafness

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL), specifically how to approach its definition, diagnosis with audiometry, distinguishing it from conductive causes at the bedside, identifying red flags that affect management, conducting a retrocochlear workup, reviewing evidence-based treatment options and timing (including steroids, intratympanic salvage, and hyperbaric oxygen therapy), confirming follow-up and outcomes assessment, considering special populations, and providing patient counseling along with a concise algorithm summary.

> Let me first confirm the definition and diagnostic threshold. SSNHL is defined as a sensorineural hearing loss of at least 30 dB at three contiguous frequencies occurring within 72 hours, and the diagnosis must be confirmed by formal audiometry as soon as possible, ideally within 14 days of symptom onset, because clinical impressions alone are insufficient and delays can worsen outcomes [^113YDpA5] [^113HGVdS] [^111HCeRi].

> Wait, let me verify the initial bedside differentiation from conductive hearing loss. I should use otoscopy to exclude cerumen, otitis media, or tympanic membrane pathology, and then use tuning fork tests (Weber lateralizes to the unaffected ear in SSNHL. Rinne is positive) to support a sensorineural pattern before audiometric confirmation, because misclassifying conductive loss as sensorineural leads to mismanagement and missed opportunities for recovery [^111b7Y1H] [^111yLNaT] [^115DVHvR].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about etiology. I need to check for modifying factors in history and exam that suggest non-idiopathic causes: bilateral sudden loss, recurrent episodes, fluctuating hearing, focal neurologic deficits, vesicles in the ear canal or facial palsy, or systemic features suggesting autoimmune disease, infection, ototoxic exposure, or vascular disease, because these findings alter the workup and urgency of management [^113bM5dh] [^113B8CYK] [^115mdbu1].

> I should confirm the retrocochlear evaluation strategy. For unilateral SSNHL without red flags, MRI of the internal auditory canals with contrast is preferred to exclude vestibular schwannoma or other posterior fossa lesions; if MRI is contraindicated, auditory brainstem response (ABR) is an alternative, though MRI has higher sensitivity and is generally preferred when available [^113waj5F] [^111zJBPB].

> Next, I will examine first-line treatment and timing. Systemic corticosteroids are an option within 2 weeks of onset, typically prednisone 60 mg daily with a taper over 10–14 days. However, I should double-check the evidence strength, as guidelines frame this as an option rather than a mandate due to conflicting RCT data, so shared decision-making is essential, especially in patients with diabetes or other steroid-contraindicated conditions [^113fkLNL] [^115gLMcf] [^113BDtoH].

> Let me consider salvage therapy for incomplete recovery. If there is incomplete recovery after 2–6 weeks, intratympanic steroid perfusion is recommended as salvage. I need to ensure timing is not delayed beyond this window, as most RCTs initiated intratympanic therapy within about 7 days of completing systemic treatment, and the balance of benefit over local risks supports offering this modality [^1166JvBr] [^112mKSKW].

> I should review hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT). HBOT combined with steroids may be offered within 2 weeks of onset as initial therapy or within 1 month as salvage; a recent meta-analysis of randomized trials showed an approximately 10 dB mean hearing gain advantage over control therapies, but access and logistics vary, so I need to discuss uncertainties and practicalities with the patient [^116iFuPV] [^1134nba9].

> But wait, what about other medications. I need to ensure I do not routinely prescribe antivirals, vasodilators, thrombolytics, or vasoactive substances, as these lack supportive evidence and carry potential harms; I should reserve any off-label use for individualized scenarios with shared decision-making and clear documentation of rationale [^113RHqiW] [^116pBiNg].

> Next, I should review what to avoid in the initial workup. Routine head CT and routine laboratory testing are not recommended in presumptive SSNHL. Targeted imaging or labs are reasonable only when clinical features suggest a specific alternative diagnosis, so I must resist low-yield testing that delays care and increases cost [^113Qz91y] [^1169ApaQ].

> I will now examine follow-up and outcomes assessment. Follow-up audiometry should be obtained at the conclusion of treatment and again within 6 months to document recovery, detect delayed improvement or progression, and guide rehabilitation. Recovery should be categorized using standardized criteria comparing to the unaffected ear, with complete recovery typically defined as within 10 dB and word recognition within 5–10% of the contralateral ear [^1118sMYX] [^112xiXre].

> Let me think about rehabilitation and supportive care. Patients with residual hearing loss and/or tinnitus should be counseled on amplification options, including hearing aids, CROS/BiCROS, and assistive technologies, and referred for audiologic rehabilitation. For severe to profound persistent loss, cochlear implantation may be appropriate after allowing time for spontaneous recovery, typically not before 3–6 months, with preoperative counseling on expectations and alternatives [^111nPgcT] [^117TnSfm] [^1134gFNj].

> I should confirm special populations and contexts. In children, SSNHL is rare and evidence is limited. Adult protocols are often extrapolated, but a high index of suspicion and early steroid therapy are reasonable while ensuring appropriate pediatric workup. Post-COVID SSNHL has been reported and warrants the same urgent steroid-based approach when no other cause is identified. Simultaneous bilateral SSNHL is uncommon and should prompt evaluation for systemic or vascular etiologies, including vertebrobasilar insufficiency or AICA territory ischemia, given the worse prognosis and different pathophysiology [^111wx59s] [^111Yqt5f] [^113axch1] [^115KAQip].

> Hold on, I should verify prognostic factors to guide counseling. Worse baseline hearing thresholds, flat or downsloping audiometric configurations, presence of vertigo, older age, and longer delays to treatment are associated with poorer recovery. Importantly, spontaneous recovery occurs in roughly one-third to two-thirds of untreated patients, with a meta-analytic mean gain of about 24 dB at 2–3 months, which underscores the need for cautious interpretation of treatment effects and transparent counseling about natural history [^114H5kbu] [^116kvSAX] [^1165qX6H].

> Let me reconsider the overall algorithm to ensure coherence. First, distinguish SSNHL from conductive loss at the bedside and confirm with urgent audiometry. Second, screen for modifying factors and pursue MRI or ABR for retrocochlear pathology. Third, offer systemic steroids within 2 weeks as an option with shared decision-making. Fourth, if incomplete recovery, provide intratympanic salvage at 2–6 weeks and consider HBOT within the appropriate windows. Fifth, avoid low-value tests and medications. And sixth, arrange structured follow-up audiometry and rehabilitation referrals to optimize functional outcomes [^112i7Fz6] [^111yLNaT] [^113fkLNL] [^1166JvBr] [^116iFuPV] [^1118sMYX].

Sudden deafness, or sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL), is a rapid, unexplained loss of hearing of at least 30 dB across three contiguous frequencies within 72 hours [^113YDpA5], most often unilateral and idiopathic [^112oREWC]. It is an **otologic emergency** [^112LubvV] requiring immediate evaluation and treatment to maximize recovery [^111LLmK3]. Early **corticosteroids** (systemic and/or intratympanic) [^113fkLNL] are first-line [^113fkLNL]; hyperbaric oxygen therapy is a guideline-supported adjunct [^1134nba9] [^116iFuPV]. Audiometry should be obtained within 14 days [^113HGVdS] to confirm the diagnosis, and MRI or ABR is used to exclude retrocochlear pathology [^113waj5F]. Spontaneous recovery occurs in 32–65% [^1165qX6H], but delays in treatment reduce the likelihood of improvement [^116YJ1A6]; persistent loss may require rehabilitation or cochlear implantation [^114GZ1mE].

---

## Definition and clinical presentation

- **Definition**: SSNHL is defined as a sensorineural hearing loss of ≥ 30 dB [^113YDpA5] in three contiguous frequencies occurring within 72 hours [^113YDpA5].

- **Clinical features**: Typically unilateral [^112oREWC], often accompanied by tinnitus, aural fullness, and vertigo [^112oREWC] [^111b7Y1H].

- **Incidence**: Estimated at 5–27 per 100,000 people annually in the United States [^111LLmK3], with approximately 66,000 new cases per year [^115N5fFw].

---

## Etiology and risk factors

SSNHL is **idiopathic in most cases** [^112oREWC], but proposed mechanisms include viral infection, vascular compromise, autoimmune inflammation, and cochlear membrane rupture [^112yanou]. Risk factors include **age**, **male sex**, cardiovascular risk factors (hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia), and recent viral infections [^notfound].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

- **Audiometry**: Obtain audiometry as soon as possible (within 14 days) [^113HGVdS] to confirm the diagnosis and assess severity [^111HCeRi].

- **Imaging**: MRI or auditory brainstem response (ABR) [^113waj5F] to evaluate for retrocochlear pathology (e.g. vestibular schwannoma) [^111zJBPB].

- **Laboratory tests**: Routine laboratory tests are not recommended unless indicated by clinical suspicion of systemic disease [^115DVHvR].

---

## Treatment

- **Corticosteroids**: Systemic corticosteroids (oral or intratympanic) are first-line therapy [^113fkLNL] and should be initiated within 2 weeks of symptom onset [^115gLMcf].

- **Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT)**: Considered as adjunctive therapy within 2 weeks of onset, particularly in combination with corticosteroids [^1134nba9] [^116iFuPV].

- **Salvage therapy**: Intratympanic corticosteroids are recommended for patients with incomplete recovery 2–6 weeks after onset [^112mKSKW].

---

## Prognosis

Spontaneous recovery occurs in **32–65%** of patients, usually within the first two weeks [^1165qX6H] [^115cxbES]. Factors associated with a poorer prognosis include **profound hearing loss**, **flat audiometric configuration**, **vertigo**, and **delayed treatment** [^114H5kbu].

---

## Complications

Persistent hearing loss can significantly affect **communication**, **social interactions**, and **quality of life** [^116YJ1A6]. Tinnitus is common and may persist even after hearing recovery [^1165qX6H]. Psychological effects, including anxiety, depression, and social isolation, are frequent [^notfound].

---

## Prevention and follow-up

Prevention focuses on risk-factor modification (e.g. cardiovascular risk management) and prompt treatment of infections. Follow-up should include **audiometric evaluation** at the conclusion of treatment and within 6 months [^1118sMYX], with counseling on rehabilitation options for residual hearing loss or tinnitus [^111nPgcT].

---

Sudden deafness is a **medical emergency** characterized by rapid, unexplained hearing loss. Early diagnosis and treatment — particularly with **corticosteroids** and adjunctive **hyperbaric oxygen therapy** — are critical for improving outcomes. Persistent hearing loss and tinnitus are common complications, necessitating ongoing follow-up and rehabilitation.

Prior episodes or fluctuating hearing — most cases of SSNHL are not preceded by fluctuating hearing, so this history should raise suspicion for a nonidiopathic case; patients with a history of fluctuating hearing loss presenting with SSNHL should be evaluated for causes such as Ménière's disease, autoimmune inner ear disease, Cogan's syndrome, and hyperviscosity syndrome, with Ménière's disease the most common cause, and autoimmune inner ear disease and Cogan's syndrome notable for bilateral involvement being common at onset.

Objective

Sudden hearing loss is a frightening symptom that often prompts an urgent or emergent visit to a health care provider. It is frequently, but not universally, accompanied by tinnitus and/or vertigo. Sudden sensorineural hearing loss affects 5 to 27 per 100,000 people annually, with about 66,000 new cases per year in the United States. This guideline update provides evidence-based recommendations for the diagnosis, management, and follow-up of patients who present with sudden hearing loss. It focuses on sudden sensorineural hearing loss in adult patients aged 18 and over and primarily on those with idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss. Prompt recognition and management of sudden sensorineural hearing loss may improve hearing recovery and patient quality of life. The guideline update is intended for all clinicians who diagnose or manage adult patients who present with sudden hearing loss.

Purpose

The purpose of this guideline update is to provide clinicians with evidence-based recommendations in evaluating patients with sudden hearing loss and sudden sensorineural hearing loss, with particular emphasis on managing idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss. The guideline update group recognized that patients enter the health care system with sudden hearing loss as a nonspecific primary complaint. Therefore, the initial recommendations of this guideline update address distinguishing sensorineural hearing loss from conductive hearing loss at the time of presentation with hearing loss. They also clarify the need to identify rare, nonidiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss to help separate those patients from those with idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss, who are the target population for the therapeutic interventions that make up the bulk of the guideline update. By focusing on opportunities for quality improvement, this guideline should improve diagnostic accuracy, facilitate prompt intervention, decrease variations in management, reduce unnecessary tests and imaging procedures, and improve hearing and rehabilitative outcomes for affected patients.

Methods

Consistent with the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation's Clinical Practice Guideline Development Manual, Third Edition, the guideline update group was convened with representation from the disciplines of otolaryngology-head and neck surgery, otology, neurotology, family medicine, audiology, emergency medicine, neurology, radiology, advanced practice nursing, and consumer advocacy. A systematic review of the literature was performed, and the prior clinical practice guideline on sudden hearing loss was reviewed in detail. Key action statements (KASs) were updated with new literature, and evidence profiles were brought up to the current standard. Research needs identified in the original clinical practice guideline and data addressing them were reviewed. Current research needs were identified and delineated.

Results

The guideline update group made strong recommendations for the following: clinicians should distinguish sensorineural hearing loss from conductive hearing loss when a patient first presents with sudden hearing loss (KAS 1); clinicians should educate patients with sudden sensorineural hearing loss about the natural history of the condition, the benefits and risks of medical interventions, and the limitations of existing evidence regarding efficacy (KAS 7); and clinicians should counsel patients with sudden sensorineural hearing loss who have residual hearing loss and/or tinnitus about the possible benefits of audiological rehabilitation and other supportive measures (KAS 13). These strong recommendations were modified from the initial clinical practice guideline for clarity and timing of intervention. The guideline update group made strong recommendation against the following: clinicians should not order routine computed tomography of the head in the initial evaluation of a patient with presumptive sudden sensorineural hearing loss (KAS 3); clinicians should not obtain routine laboratory tests in patients with sudden sensorineural hearing loss (KAS 5); and clinicians should not routinely prescribe antivirals, thrombolytics, vasodilators, or vasoactive substances to patients with sudden sensorineural hearing loss (KAS 11). The guideline update group made recommendations for the following: clinicians should assess patients with presumptive sudden sensorineural hearing loss through history and physical examination for bilateral sudden hearing loss, recurrent episodes of sudden hearing loss, and/or focal neurologic findings (KAS 2); in patients with sudden hearing loss, clinicians should obtain, or refer to a clinician who can obtain, audiometry as soon as possible (within 14 days of symptom onset) to confirm the diagnosis of sudden sensorineural hearing loss (KAS 4); clinicians should evaluate patients with sudden sensorineural hearing loss for retrocochlear pathology by obtaining a magnetic resonance imaging or auditory brainstem response (KAS 6); clinicians should offer, or refer to a clinician who can offer, intratympanic steroid therapy when patients have incomplete recovery from sudden sensorineural hearing loss 2 to 6 weeks after onset of symptoms (KAS 10); and clinicians should obtain follow-up audiometric evaluation for patients with sudden sensorineural hearing loss at the conclusion of treatment and within 6 months of completion of treatment (KAS 12). These recommendations were clarified in terms of timing of intervention and audiometry, as well as method of retrocochlear workup. The guideline update group offered the following KASs as options: clinicians may offer corticosteroids as initial therapy to patients with sudden sensorineural hearing loss within 2 weeks of symptom onset (KAS 8); clinicians may offer, or refer to a clinician who can offer, hyperbaric oxygen therapy combined with steroid therapy within 2 weeks of onset of sudden sensorineural hearing loss (KAS 9a); and clinicians may offer, or refer to a clinician who can offer, hyperbaric oxygen therapy combined with steroid therapy as salvage therapy within 1 month of onset of sudden sensorineural hearing loss (KAS 9b).

Differences From Prior Guideline

Incorporation of new evidence profiles to include quality improvement opportunities, confidence in the evidence, and differences of opinion Included 10 clinical practice guidelines, 29 new systematic reviews, and 36 new randomized controlled trials Highlights the urgency of evaluation and initiation of treatment, if treatment is offered, by emphasizing the time from symptom occurrence Clarification of terminology by changing potentially unclear statements; use of the term sudden sensorineural hearing loss to mean idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss to emphasize that over 90% of sudden sensorineural hearing loss is idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss and to avoid confusion in nomenclature for the reader Changes to the key action statements (KASs) from the original guideline: KAS 1: When a patient first presents with sudden hearing loss, conductive hearing loss should be distinguished from sensorineural. KAS 2: The utility of history and physical examination when assessing for modifying factors is emphasized. KAS 3: The word routine is added to clarify that this statement addresses a nontargeted head computed tomography scan that is often ordered in the emergency room setting for patients presenting with sudden hearing loss. It does not refer to targeted scans such as a temporal bone computed tomography scan to assess for temporal bone pathology. KAS 4: The importance of audiometric confirmation of hearing status as soon as possible and within 14 days of symptom onset is emphasized. KAS 5: New studies were added to confirm the lack of benefit of nontargeted laboratory testing in sudden sensorineural hearing loss. KAS 6: Audiometric follow-up is excluded as a reasonable workup for retrocochlear pathology. Magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography scan if magnetic resonance imaging cannot be done, or, secondarily, auditory brainstem response evaluation are the modalities recommended. A time frame for such testing is not specified, nor is it specified which clinician should be ordering this workup; however, it is implied that it would be the general or subspecialty otolaryngologist. KAS 7: The importance of shared decision making is highlighted, and salient points are emphasized. KAS 8: The option for corticosteroid intervention within 2 weeks of symptom onset is emphasized. KAS 9: Changed to KAS 9a and 9b; hyperbaric oxygen therapy remains an option but only when combined with steroid therapy for either initial treatment (9a) or for salvage therapy (9b). The timing is within 2 weeks of onset for initial therapy and within 1 month of onset of sudden sensorineural hearing loss for salvage therapy. KAS 10: Intratympanic steroid therapy for salvage is recommended within 2 to 6 weeks following onset of sudden sensorineural hearing loss. The time to treatment is defined and emphasized. KAS 11: Antioxidants were removed from the list of interventions that the clinical practice guideline recommends against using. KAS 12: Follow-up audiometry at conclusion of treatment and also within 6 months posttreatment is added. KAS 13: This statement on audiologic rehabilitation includes patients who have residual hearing loss and/or tinnitus who may benefit from treatment. Addition of an algorithm outlining KASs Enhanced emphasis on patient education and shared decision making with tools provided to assist in the same.

### Altered contralateral auditory cortical morphology in unilateral sudden sensorineural hearing loss [^113CngDq]. Otology & Neurotology (2015). Low credibility.

Sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL), commonly known as sudden deafness, can be associated with tinnitus and vertigo and is defined as mostly unilateral decline of hearing function of more than 30 dB in at least three sequential frequencies over 3 days or less. The incidence of SSNHL was reported to range from 3.9 to 27.5 per 100,000 per year and is considered to be an otologic emergency. Although some pathophysiological mechanisms have been proposed, the precise cause of SSNHL is still unknown. Hearing loss is usually unilateral and has no side preference, and only less than 5% of the SSNHL patients were reported to have bilateral involvement. What is worse is that it has been reported that the hearing function of the SSNHL patients will not be improved even after high-quality appropriate therapy, which indicates that perhaps there already exists some type of irreversible brain structural damage in these SSNHL patients.

Brain structural alterations have been reported in patients with auditory impairment such as tinnitus, unilateral hearing loss, or deafness in auditory and nonauditory areas. However, the results of SSNHL studies vary because of some inhomogeneous experimental factors such as the sample age, disease duration, and the side of the hearing impairments. For example, Yang et al. investigated regional brain structural alterations in 14 patients with 14.2 years of right-sided unilateral sudden hearing loss and found decreased gray matter volume in the bilateral posterior cingulate gyrus and precuneus, left superior/middle/inferior temporal gyrus, right parahippocampal gyrus, and lingual gyrus compared with healthy controls, which suggests that chronic unilateral sudden hearing loss could induce brain morphological changes. Boyen et al. found GM increases in the superior and middle temporal gyrus and decreases in the superior frontal gyrus, occipital lobe, and hypothalamus in 16 hearing loss patients compared with 24 healthy controls. Although there were already some studies that reported the brain atrophy and impaired microstructure induced by unilateral sudden sensorineural hearing loss, whether these changes already exist during the acute period is still unknown. The inconsistencies between previous studies of unilateral SSNHL and the lack of the brain structure alterations in the acute period prompted us to set up a new voxel-based morphometry (VBM) study to gain more insight into the neuroanatomical differences that are related to unilateral SSNHL.

### Alert cards to improve awareness of an otological emergency [^113adegS]. BMJ Open Quality (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL) is a distressing condition that may lead to permanent disability with severe/profound deafness and tinnitus. While the aetiology varies, and is often idiopathic, urgent audiological assessment and management improves likelihood of hearing recovery. Bilateral vestibular schwannomas (VS) are a hallmark feature of neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) occurring in over 95% of patients. Up to 12% of patients with VS may present with SSNHL. Sudden hearing loss should be urgently assessed to determine if conductive or sensorineural using physical examination, otoscopy, tuning fork tests or audiometry. If found to be sensorineural, urgent treatment with high-dose oral and/or intratympanic steroids are indicated.

It is recognised that presentation of SSNHL to an ENT specialist is often delayed, with resulting delay in treatment which may lead to reduced chance of recovery. The reasons for this delay in presentation are likely to be multifactorial and may include a lack of awareness among patients and clinicians for the potential of sudden hearing loss to be sensorineural and a medical emergency. This most likely occurs due to the understandable initial assumption that new-onset hearing loss is most commonly due to a conductive cause such as wax impaction or glue ear following an upper respiratory illness. However, patients with NF2 are at significant increased risk of SSNHL due to their VS and the assumption that sudden hearing loss is most likely to be conductive is not appropriate and may lead to suboptimal management and outcomes for this otological emergency.

Alert Cards have been shown to improve patient and clinician response in other medical emergencies. We hypothesised therefore that use of a patient Alert Card would increase patient and clinician understanding of the need for urgent audiological assessment of sudden hearing loss in our at-risk population with the potential to reduce morbidity.

We aimed to determine if the introduction of a patient Alert Card would improve patient awareness of the need for urgent assessment of sudden hearing loss.

### Clinical practice guideline: sudden hearing loss (update) [^113bM5dh]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Statement 2 — Modifying factors in presumptive sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL) — states that clinicians should assess patients through history and physical examination for bilateral sudden hearing loss (SHL), recurrent episodes of SHL, and/or focal neurologic findings; this is a Recommendation based on observational studies with a preponderance of benefit over harm. The Action Statement Profile 2 notes a quality improvement opportunity to identify patients with potentially serious alternative conditions; rates the aggregate evidence quality as Grade C with level of confidence in the evidence High; lists benefits as identification of patients with a high likelihood of alternative and potentially serious underlying cause requiring specialized assessment and management; notes risks, harms, costs as time of assessment; and assesses benefits-harm as a preponderance of benefit over harm with policy level Recommendation.

### Bilateral sudden on chronic hearing loss as an auditory manifestation of mitochondrial DNA mutations [^112qKump]. The Laryngoscope (2025). Medium credibility.

We presented a series of patients with a mitochondrial DNA mutation who presented to our clinic with sudden bilateral sudden on chronic sensorineural hearing loss; these patients responded well to cochlear implantation. In cases of sudden sensorineural hearing loss-particularly when clinical features raise suspicion for an underlying mitochondrial disorder-genetic testing may offer valuable diagnostic insight and assist in guiding appropriate management strategies.

### Clinical practice guideline: sudden hearing loss (update) [^111yLNaT]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Sudden hearing loss guideline — diagnostic evaluation: Clinicians should distinguish sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) from conductive hearing loss (CHL) when a patient first presents with sudden hearing loss (SHL). In patients with SHL clinicians should obtain, or refer to a clinician who can obtain, audiometry as soon as possible (within 14 days of symptom onset) to confirm the diagnosis of sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL). Clinicians should not order routine computed tomography (CT) of the head in the initial evaluation of a patient with presumptive SSNHL, and clinicians should not obtain routine laboratory tests in patients with SSNHL. Clinicians should evaluate patients with SSNHL for retrocochlear pathology by obtaining an MRI or auditory brainstem response (ABR).

### Sudden hearing loss [^114EVcZf]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Sudden sensorineural hearing loss is a medical emergency in search of an appropriate treatment. Almost all aspects of this disease process are disputed in the literature. The natural course of the disease process has not been well defined, although spontaneous recovery in a percentage of patients appears well accepted. Little scientific data exist to develop an evidence-based treatment protocol. The more common elements of treatment in the United States include oral steroid therapy, transtympanic steroid therapy, and potentially oral antiviral therapy. Other therapies are used with great frequency, and their potential should not be discounted.

### Evidence-based practice: management of adult sensorineural hearing loss [^111Lw2ru]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Sensorineural hearing loss is a complex disease state influenced by genetics, age, noise, and many other factors. This article reviews our current knowledge regarding the causes of sensorineural hearing loss and reviews the more challenging clinical presentations of sensorineural hearing loss. We have reviewed the latest medical literature in an attempt to provide an evidence-based strategy for the assessment and management of sudden sensorineural hearing loss, rapidly progressive sensorineural hearing loss, and asymmetric/unilateral sensorineural hearing loss.

### Altered contralateral auditory cortical morphology in unilateral sudden sensorineural hearing loss [^113hJWrz]. Otology & Neurotology (2015). Low credibility.

In summary, we found that detectable decreased contralateral auditory cortical morphological changes have occurred in unilateral SSNHL patients within the acute period by voxel-based morphometry methods. The gray matter volumes of these brain areas also perform a negative correlation with the duration of the disease, which suggests a gradual brain structural impairment after the progression of the disease. These findings could help to better characterize unilateral SSNHL and provide insights for the potential pathophysiology of unilateral SSNHL, which will ultimately assist in providing a better diagnosis and more accurate and effective treatment of unilateral SSNHL. It is hoped that this study will alert audiologists to not only focus on the abnormal in the peripheral auditory system but also be aware of the alteration of the gray matter in the cerebral cortex that the unilateral SSNHL patients might have.

### Clinical practice guideline: sudden hearing loss (update) [^112xiXre]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Outcomes assessment in sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL) — Unless a preevent asymmetry of hearing was known or suspected, the unaffected ear should be used as the standard against which recovery should be compared. A complete recovery requires return to within 10 dB HL of the unaffected ear and recovery of WRSs to within 5% to 10% of the unaffected ear. Partial recovery should be defined in 2 ways based on whether the degree of initial hearing loss after the event of SSNHL rendered the ear nonserviceable (per AAO-HNSF definition) or not. Anything less than a 10–dB HL improvement should be classified as no recovery. For ears that were rendered nonserviceable by the episode of SSNHL, return to serviceable hearing should be considered a significant improvement, and whether or not this level of recovery occurs should be recorded. For ears with SSNHL to hearing levels that are still in the serviceable range, an improvement of > 10 dB in pure tone thresholds or an improvement in WRS of ≥ 10% should be considered partial recovery and recorded. For future studies of treatment outcomes, the panel urges the use of the standardized format for reporting hearing outcomes detailed in Gurgel et al.

### Natural history of untreated idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss [^116kvSAX]. The Laryngoscope (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

Although corticosteroids and other treatments for idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss (ISSNHL) have been described, understanding its prognosis without intervention provides valuable information for patient management. The objective of this study is to provide a comprehensive, quantitative statistical analysis of the natural history of untreated idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss (ISSNHL).

Study Type and Design

A systematic review and meta-analyses.

Methods

Two independent searches of PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases up to June 30, 2022, were performed. Adults with idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss who received placebo or were untreated and had audiometric outcome measures in all study types were reviewed. These data indicative of the natural history of ISSNHL were analyzed, as were study characteristics related to risk of bias. Heterogeneity as assessed via I 2 and random effects analyses were performed.

Results

Six studies meeting the inclusion criteria yielded 319 untreated patients whose natural history could be assessed. Heterogeneity among studies was moderate, with a variety of reported outcomes. A hearing improvement of at least 30dB HL was observed in 36% (95% CI 0.28–0.44) of untreated patients, and of at least 10dB HL was observed in 70% (95% CI 0.57–0.82) of untreated patients at 3months. The mean hearing gain among untreated patients was 24.0dB HL (95% CI 2.65–45.37) at 2–3months.

Conclusions

The observed natural history of ISSNHL suggests that patients can regain some hearing without active treatment. In the absence of future studies collecting prospective natural history data from untreated or placebo-treated ISSNHL patients, the data presented here provide the best available historical control data for reconsideration of results in past ISSNHL studies, as well as a roadmap for design and interpretation of future ISSNHL treatment clinical trials. Furthermore, knowing there is a statistically significant mean hearing gain of 24.0dB HL in the untreated/placebo group provides an ethical basis for future placebo study of ISSNHL. The current status on ISSNHL management calls for a multi-institutional, randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial with validated outcome measures to provide science-based treatment guidance.

Importance

Sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL) is an acute, usually unilateral deficit. Systemic and intratympanic steroids are accepted treatments. Although evidence suggests that hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) may be beneficial, it is not widely offered.

Objectives

To review and evaluate recent evidence of the association of HBOT with hearing outcomes in SSNHL and to determine if HBOT should be a single or part of a combination treatment regimen.

Data Sources

Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, Web of Science, CAB, ICTRP, Google Scholar, Clinicaltrials.gov, and ISRCTN databases were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published in English from January 1, 2000, and April 30, 2020.

Study Selection

Prospective RCTs involving only adult participants (≥ 18 years) with SSNHL and comparing HBOT, as a single or combination therapy, with control therapies, such as steroids and/or placebo. Only RCTs that used the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery's diagnostic criteria for SSNHL were included.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Data were extracted independently by 2 researchers. A fixed-effects model was used for analysis and performed from November 30, 2020, to May 20, 2021.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The mean difference in absolute hearing gain recorded by pure-tone audiometric (PTA) thresholds averaged across 4 low (0.5, 1, 2, and 3 or 4 kHz) or 3 high (3 or 4, 6, and 8 kHz) frequencies was the primary outcome. The secondary outcomes were the odds ratio of hearing recovery defined as a hearing gain of ≥ 10 decibels (dB) in PTA average and treatment-related adverse effects.

Results

Of the 826 records initially identified, 358 duplicates and 451 articles were excluded based on article type, title, and abstract. The full texts of 17 articles were reviewed, of which 14 were excluded because they were either not prospective RCTs (11 articles), the participants were less than 18 years old (2 articles), or the PTA was not reported at frequencies of interest (1 article). Three prospective RCTs with a total of 88 participants who received HBOT in the intervention groups and 62 participants who received only medical therapy in the control groups were studied. The intergroup difference in mean absolute hearing gain (mean difference, 10.3 dB; 95% CI, 6.5–14.1 dB; I2 = 0%) and the odds ratio of hearing recovery (4.3; 95% CI, 1.6–11.7; I2 = 0%) favored HBOT over the control therapy.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, HBOT as part of a combination treatment was significantly associated with improved hearing outcomes in patients with SSNHL over control treatments.

### Clinical practice guideline: sudden hearing loss (update) [^111gL97u]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Differences from prior guideline — scope updates and KAS clarifications: The update included 10 clinical practice guidelines, 29 new systematic reviews, and 36 new randomized controlled trials, and clarified terminology to use the term sudden sensorineural hearing loss to mean idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss to emphasize that > 90% of sudden sensorineural hearing loss is idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss. It highlights the urgency of evaluation and initiation of treatment, if treatment is offered, by emphasizing the time from symptom occurrence. Changes include KAS 1 stating that when a patient first presents with sudden hearing loss, conductive hearing loss should be distinguished from sensorineural; KAS 3 clarifying the word "routine" to address nontargeted head computerized tomography scans and that this does not refer to targeted scans such as temporal bone computerized tomography scan; KAS 4 emphasizing audiometric confirmation as soon as possible and within 14 days of symptom onset; and KAS 6 specifying retrocochlear workup modalities including magnetic resonance imaging, computerized tomography scan if magnetic resonance imaging cannot be done, and, secondarily, auditory brainstem response evaluation.

### Sudden sensorineural hearing loss in children: clinical characteristics, etiology, treatment outcomes, and prognostic factors [^116jWKJY]. Otology & Neurotology (2019). Medium credibility.

Sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL) is a unilateral or bilateral sensorineural hearing loss with at least 30 dB decrease in threshold in three contiguous test frequencies occurring over 72 hours or less. In the United States, the incidence of SSNHL has been reported to be 27 per 100,000 per year. The age of SSNHL mainly occurred in 25–60-year-old patients, of whom 46–49 years old was the most common. Studies of SSNHL in children are rare in the literature. There were 6.6% of patients with SSNHL under 18 years of age. Due to the low incidence of SSNHL in children, its clinical characteristics, etiology, treatment outcomes, and prognosis have been most likely deemed to be less relevant. At present, the etiology of childhood SSNHL still remains unclear. It has been reported in the literature that childhood SSNHL is mostly idiopathic and may be related to viral infections (cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus type 1 and type 2, rubella virus, etc.), congenital causes (large vestibular aqueduct syndrome, Mondini deformity), trauma, tumors (acoustic neuroma, multiple myeloma, etc.), autoimmune diseases, systemic immune diseases (SLE, Cogan's syndrome, Wegener's granulomatosis, etc.), ototoxic drugs, vascular diseases, metabolic disease, Meniere's disease, central deafness, etc. Currently, there are no specific tests or diagnostic criteria for children with SSNHL caused by viral infections, autoimmune diseases, systemic diseases, vascular diseases and metabolic diseases. In the present study, a series of laboratory tests were performed on pediatric patients with SSNHL in an attempt to find out the possible causes of hearing loss.

### Predictors of delays in the management of idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss [^113dDgWM]. The Laryngoscope (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss (ISSNHL) is a medical emergency defined by the National Institute of Deafness and other Communication Disorders as a sensorineural hearing loss of at least 30 dB in each of three or more consecutive speech frequencies occurring within the 3 days preceding presentation. These criteria were adopted by the 2019 Clinical Practice Guideline of Sudden Hearing Loss by the American Academy of Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery. The reported incidence of ISSNHL is highly variable, with rates of 27 and 60 per 100,000/year in the United States and the European Union, respectively, have been cited. This number might be higher because many patients recover spontaneously without seeking medical attention. Steroids comprise the mainstay of treatment, and they can be administered either systemically or locally by injection through the middle ear.

Several prognostic factors have been defined regarding ISSNHL recovery, including the patient's age, audiogram configuration at presentation, presence of vertigo, comorbidities, and total delay. Total delay can be subdivided into patient‐dependent delay (also called "presentation" delay as well as "time from ISSNHL onset to seeking first medical advice"), diagnostic delay, and treatment delay. Although all factors other than total delay are defined by the patient or the pathology and are uncontrollable, total delay can be modified.

The combination of diagnostic and treatment delays is called a "system delay" (Fig. 1). Although several studies have aimed to reduce system delays in the setting of ISSNHL, none have similarly studied patient delay. The aim of this paper is to study correlations between epidemiological and demographic characteristics and various delays in order to better define the causes for total delay and identify patients with ISSNHL who are at high risk for total delay to initiating empiric treatment with steroids.

### Effectiveness of treatment for sudden sensorineural hearing loss… [^112yanou]. JAMA Network (2000). Excellent credibility.

KAREN H. CALHOUNMDRONALD B. KUPPERSMITHMDFrom the Division of Otology/Neurotology, Department of Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery, University of Michigan Health System, Ann Arbor. Sudden-onset unilateral sensorineural hearing loss has no effective treatment. The phenomenon of sudden-onset, unilateral sensorineural hearing loss has been recognized and well described for some time. Whether it represents a single pathophysiologic entity or is the common end point of numerous, varied pathologic processes remains unknown. Many different causes of SSNHL have been hypothesized: viral infection of the labyrinth or cochlear nerve; vascular insult; perilymphatic hypoxia; intralabyrinthine membrane rupture; inflammatory and metabolic causes; and others. However, none has been shown to cause all, or even most, cases of SSNHL. There is not even universal acceptance of a standard definition of SSNHL.

Although many authors define SSNHL as loss of at least 30 decibels in 3 contiguous frequencies over a period of 3 days or less, some investigators use more or less stringent criteria. This article reviews the most significant published data on treatment of SSNHL and attempts to synthesize them and draw reasonable conclusions on optimal treatment of this difficult problem.

### Metachronous sudden sensorineural hearing loss: patient characteristics and treatment outcomes [^1133ygyZ]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss (ISSNHL) is a distressing condition that can significantly affect quality of life. Unilateral ISSNHL, occurring first in 1 ear and then the contralateral ear at a separate and discrete time, is a rare presentation that we refer to as metachronous ISSNHL. Our objective was to characterize the presentation of metachronous ISSNHL and report on management and hearing outcomes.

Study Design

Retrospective case series.

Setting

Otology clinic at an academic tertiary referral center.

Subjects and Methods

Patients ≥ 18 years old presenting with metachronous ISSNHL between April 2008 to November 2017 were identified through review of the clinic electronic medical record. Metachronous ISSNHL was defined as unilateral ISSNHL occurring in temporally discrete episodes (> 6 months apart) affecting both ears. Patients with identifiable causes for sudden hearing loss were excluded. Patient demographics, comorbidities, management, and audiologic outcomes were recorded.

Results

Eleven patients with metachronous ISSNHL were identified out of 558 patients with ISSNHL. In patients with metachronous ISSNHL, the mean ± standard deviation age at the time of ISSNHL in the second ear was 58.6 ± 15.2 years (range, 31–77 years). The mean interval between episodes was 9.6 ± 7.5 years (range, 1–22 years). Patients were treated with systemic and intratympanic steroids with variable hearing recovery; 5 patients with resultant bilateral severe to profound hearing loss underwent successful cochlear implantation.

Conclusion

Metachronous ISSNHL is uncommon. Treatment is similar to ISSNHL, and cochlear implantation can successfully restore hearing in individuals who do not experience recovery.

Table 1. Definitions of common terminology — sudden hearing loss: Sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL) is defined as "a subset of SHL that (a) is sensorineural in nature, (b) occurs within a 72-hour window, and (c) consists of a decrease in hearing of ≥ 30 decibels affecting at least 3 consecutive frequencies", and salvage therapy is "any therapy offered after 2 weeks from symptom onset (even if initial therapy was observation)"; the guideline notes that "expanding the definition to cases with < 30 decibels of hearing loss may be considered". It also defines sudden hearing loss (SHL) as "a rapid-onset subjective sensation of hearing impairment in one or both ears", sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) as "hearing loss resulting from abnormal function of the cochlea, auditory nerve, or higher aspects of central auditory perception or processing", conductive hearing loss (CHL) as "hearing loss resulting from a problem conducting sound waves anywhere along the route through the outer ear, tympanic membrane, or middle ear", mixed hearing loss (MHL) as "hearing loss resulting from both SNHL and CHL occurring in the same ear", and idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss (ISSNHL) as "SSNHL with no identifiable cause despite adequate investigation".

### Prognostic significance of early posttreatment audiometry in idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss [^114H5kbu]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss (ISSHL) is characterized by a sensorineural hearing loss of ≥ 30 dB within 72 hours without any identifiable cause. Although ISSHL is often viewed as a clinical symptom associated with various conditions, its exact underlying cause remains unknown. Typically, ISSHL is managed with a course of systemic or injected steroids.

The prognosis for hearing recovery after ISSHL was shown to be negatively affected by young or advanced age, the patient's initial hearing levels, the time elapsed from onset to treatment, and the presence of tinnitus or vertigo. Furthermore, other reports have indicated that sex, the pattern of hearing loss, hearing levels on the opposite side, caloric test results, thyroid stimulating hormone levels, and diabetes are also related to the prognosis.

The audiometry results obtained before treatment initiation have demonstrated a strong association with predicting recovery outcomes. Worse hearing levels at the time of diagnosis have consistently been identified as negative predictors of recovery. Laird and Wilson showed that approximately 16% of patients with profound hearing loss recover, whereas about 55% of patients with the moderate type of audiogram at diagnosis recover. Enache and Sarafoleanusuggested that even with effective treatment, a hearing loss exceeding 50 to 60 dB on an audiogram typically results in only a moderate recovery, often not exceeding 20 to 30 dB. Generally, the greater the degree of hearing loss, the more unfavorable the recovery prognosis, as it may indicate an irreversible lesion. The shape of the hearing curve has also been linked to prognosis. Flat or downward sloping audiograms predict poor outcomes, while up‐curve audiograms and those characterized by low‐frequency or mid‐frequency hearing losses are associated with better hearing recovery. Nevertheless, there is limited research on the prognostic factors related to audiometry findings after the initiation of treatment.

### Clinical practice guideline: sudden hearing loss (update) [^1165qX6H]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Guideline scope and natural history — sudden sensorineural hearing loss: The update is intended for "all clinicians who diagnose or manage adult patients (aged ≥ 18 years) who present with SHL", and emphasizes that "the distinction between SSNHL and sudden conductive or mixed hearing loss is one that should be made by the initial treating health care provider for early diagnosis and management to be instituted". Natural history data note that "32% to 65% of cases of SSNHL may recover spontaneously", but "long-term follow-up is recommended, as some patients (up to one-third) will have an underlying cause that is eventually identified but was not evident at initial presentation", and that "tinnitus is a frequent comorbidity that may persist and, with time, may become the patient's primary concern".

### Clinical practice guideline: sudden hearing loss (update) [^112i7Fz6]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Sudden hearing loss clinical practice guideline algorithm — initial steps for a patient with sudden hearing loss (SHL) are Exclude Conductive Hearing Loss (CHL), Confirm Sensorineural Hearing Loss (SNHL) by Audiogram, and Assess for Retrocochlear Pathology with Auditory Brainstem Responses (ABR) or Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Early directives include Do Not Obtain Routine Head Computed Tomography (CT) and Do Not Prescribe Antibiotics. Time-sensitive care uses onset-based branches: Is Patient Within Two Weeks of Onset of Hearing Loss? If yes, May Offer: Corticosteroids and Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy (HBOT), and Reassess Hearing Within Two to Six Weeks of Onset of Hearing Loss. Subsequent branching asks Is Patient Within One Month of Onset of Hearing Loss?, after which salvage options are Offer Transtympanic Steroids for Salvage Treatment and May Offer HBOT as Salvage Treatment If Not Done as Primary Treatment; the algorithm also includes Counsel Hearing Rehabilitation Options.

### Bilateral sudden sensorineural hearing loss: a distinct phenotype entity [^113axch1]. Otology & Neurotology (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

To investigate the clinical phenotype and hearing prognosis of patients with unilateral and bilateral (simultaneous and nonsimultaneous) sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL).

Study Design

Retrospective cohort.

Setting

Otology outpatient clinic of a tertiary university hospital.

Patients

Three hundred eighty-five medical records from patients with SSNHL.

Main Outcome Measures

Comparison of demographic, clinical, and audiometric (pretreatment and posttreatment) data of patients with unilateral and bilateral SSNHL.

Results

Our final analysis comprised of 239 medical records of patients with SSNHL. Most patients had unilateral SSNHL (186, 77.82%). We identified a potential underlying cause for the SSNHL in 105 (43.9%) of the cases, being more frequent in cases of bilateral simultaneous SSNHL (100%) as compared with unilateral (45.6%) and nonsimultaneous bilateral SSNHL (22.7%). Cases of simultaneous bilateral SSNHL presented more frequently with severe or profound hearing loss (89%; unilateral SSNHL 50.5%; nonsimultaneous bilateral SSNL, 59.1%) and had a significantly worse hearing recovery prognosis as compared with unilateral or nonsimultaneous bilateral SSNHL (p = 0.002).

Conclusion

We observed a high heterogeneity of clinical presentations of SSNHL, the most common being unilateral SSNHL. Our results demonstrate that the clinical and audiological prognosis of simultaneous bilateral SSNHL differed significantly from unilateral and nonsimultaneous bilateral SSNHL, suggesting that simultaneous cases of bilateral SSNHL may be a part of a different disease process. The presence of a simultaneous, bilateral SSNHL indicates the need to investigate the presence of an underlying systemic disease.

### Clinical practice guideline: sudden hearing loss (update) [^1122s78U]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

Sudden hearing loss is a frightening symptom that often prompts an urgent or emergent visit to a health care provider. It is frequently but not universally accompanied by tinnitus and/or vertigo. Sudden sensorineural hearing loss affects 5 to 27 per 100,000 people annually, with about 66,000 new cases per year in the United States. This guideline update provides evidence-based recommendations for the diagnosis, management, and follow-up of patients who present with sudden hearing loss. It focuses on sudden sensorineural hearing loss in adult patients aged ≥ 18 years and primarily on those with idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss. Prompt recognition and management of sudden sensorineural hearing loss may improve hearing recovery and patient quality of life. The guideline update is intended for all clinicians who diagnose or manage adult patients who present with sudden hearing loss.

Purpose

The purpose of this guideline update is to provide clinicians with evidence-based recommendations in evaluating patients with sudden hearing loss and sudden sensorineural hearing loss, with particular emphasis on managing idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss. The guideline update group recognized that patients enter the health care system with sudden hearing loss as a nonspecific primary complaint. Therefore, the initial recommendations of this guideline update address distinguishing sensorineural hearing loss from conductive hearing loss at the time of presentation with hearing loss. They also clarify the need to identify rare, nonidiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss to help separate those patients from those with idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss, who are the target population for the therapeutic interventions that make up the bulk of the guideline update. By focusing on opportunities for quality improvement, this guideline should improve diagnostic accuracy, facilitate prompt intervention, decrease variations in management, reduce unnecessary tests and imaging procedures, and improve hearing and rehabilitative outcomes for affected patients.

Methods

Consistent with the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation's "Clinical Practice Guideline Development Manual, Third Edition" (Rosenfeld et al. Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg. 2013;148[1]:S1-S55), the guideline update group was convened with representation from the disciplines of otolaryngology-head and neck surgery, otology, neurotology, family medicine, audiology, emergency medicine, neurology, radiology, advanced practice nursing, and consumer advocacy. A systematic review of the literature was performed, and the prior clinical practice guideline on sudden hearing loss was reviewed in detail. Key Action Statements (KASs) were updated with new literature, and evidence profiles were brought up to the current standard. Research needs identified in the original clinical practice guideline and data addressing them were reviewed. Current research needs were identified and delineated.

Results

The guideline update group made strong recommendations for the following: (KAS 1) Clinicians should distinguish sensorineural hearing loss from conductive hearing loss when a patient first presents with sudden hearing loss. (KAS 7) Clinicians should educate patients with sudden sensorineural hearing loss about the natural history of the condition, the benefits and risks of medical interventions, and the limitations of existing evidence regarding efficacy. (KAS 13) Clinicians should counsel patients with sudden sensorineural hearing loss who have residual hearing loss and/or tinnitus about the possible benefits of audiologic rehabilitation and other supportive measures. These strong recommendations were modified from the initial clinical practice guideline for clarity and timing of intervention. The guideline update group made strong recommendations against the following: (KAS 3) Clinicians should < u > not < /u > order routine computed tomography of the head in the initial evaluation of a patient with presumptive sudden sensorineural hearing loss. (KAS 5) Clinicians should < u > not < /u > obtain routine laboratory tests in patients with sudden sensorineural hearing loss. (KAS 11) Clinicians should < u > not < /u > routinely prescribe antivirals, thrombolytics, vasodilators, or vasoactive substances to patients with sudden sensorineural hearing loss. The guideline update group made recommendations for the following: (KAS 2) Clinicians should assess patients with presumptive sudden sensorineural hearing loss through history and physical examination for bilateral sudden hearing loss, recurrent episodes of sudden hearing loss, and/or focal neurologic findings. (KAS 4) In patients with sudden hearing loss, clinicians should obtain, or refer to a clinician who can obtain, audiometry as soon as possible (within 14 days of symptom onset) to confirm the diagnosis of sudden sensorineural hearing loss. (KAS 6) Clinicians should evaluate patients with sudden sensorineural hearing loss for retrocochlear pathology by obtaining magnetic resonance imaging or auditory brainstem response. (KAS 10) Clinicians should offer, or refer to a clinician who can offer, intratympanic steroid therapy when patients have incomplete recovery from sudden sensorineural hearing loss 2 to 6 weeks after onset of symptoms. (KAS 12) Clinicians should obtain follow-up audiometric evaluation for patients with sudden sensorineural hearing loss at the conclusion of treatment and within 6 months of completion of treatment. These recommendations were clarified in terms of timing of intervention and audiometry and method of retrocochlear workup. The guideline update group offered the following KASs as options: (KAS 8) Clinicians may offer corticosteroids as initial therapy to patients with sudden sensorineural hearing loss within 2 weeks of symptom onset. (KAS 9a) Clinicians may offer, or refer to a clinician who can offer, hyperbaric oxygen therapy combined with steroid therapy within 2 weeks of onset of sudden sensorineural hearing loss. (KAS 9b) Clinicians may offer, or refer to a clinician who can offer, hyperbaric oxygen therapy combined with steroid therapy as salvage therapy within 1 month of onset of sudden sensorineural hearing loss.

Incorporation of new evidence profiles to include quality improvement opportunities, confidence in the evidence, and differences of opinion Included 10 clinical practice guidelines, 29 new systematic reviews, and 36 new randomized controlled trials Highlights the urgency of evaluation and initiation of treatment, if treatment is offered, by emphasizing the time from symptom occurrence Clarification of terminology by changing potentially unclear statements; use of the term sudden sensorineural hearing loss to mean idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss to emphasize that > 90% of sudden sensorineural hearing loss is idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss and to avoid confusion in nomenclature for the reader Changes to the KASs from the original guideline: KAS 1-When a patient first presents with sudden hearing loss, conductive hearing loss should be distinguished from sensorineural. KAS 2-The utility of history and physical examination when assessing for modifying factors is emphasized. KAS 3-The word "routine" is added to clarify that this statement addresses nontargeted head computerized tomography scan that is often ordered in the emergency room setting for patients presenting with sudden hearing loss. It does not refer to targeted scans, such as temporal bone computerized tomography scan, to assess for temporal bone pathology. KAS 4-The importance of audiometric confirmation of hearing status as soon as possible and within 14 days of symptom onset is emphasized. KAS 5-New studies were added to confirm the lack of benefit of nontargeted laboratory testing in sudden sensorineural hearing loss. KAS 6-Audiometric follow-up is excluded as a reasonable workup for retrocochlear pathology. Magnetic resonance imaging, computerized tomography scan if magnetic resonance imaging cannot be done, and, secondarily, auditory brainstem response evaluation are the modalities recommended. A time frame for such testing is not specified, nor is it specified which clinician should be ordering this workup; however, it is implied that it would be the general or subspecialty otolaryngologist. KAS 7-The importance of shared decision making is highlighted, and salient points are emphasized. KAS 8-The option for corticosteroid intervention within 2 weeks of symptom onset is emphasized. KAS 9-Changed to KAS 9A and 9B. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy remains an option but only when combined with steroid therapy for either initial treatment (9A) or salvage therapy (9B). The timing of initial therapy is within 2 weeks of onset, and that of salvage therapy is within 1 month of onset of sudden sensorineural hearing loss. KAS 10-Intratympanic steroid therapy for salvage is recommended within 2 to 6 weeks following onset of sudden sensorineural hearing loss. The time to treatment is defined and emphasized. KAS 11-Antioxidants were removed from the list of interventions that the clinical practice guideline recommends against using. KAS 12-Follow-up audiometry at conclusion of treatment and also within 6 months posttreatment is added. KAS 13-This statement on audiologic rehabilitation includes patients who have residual hearing loss and/or tinnitus who may benefit from treatment. Addition of an algorithm outlining KASs Enhanced emphasis on patient education and shared decision making with tools provided to assist in same.

### Lyme disease associated with sudden sensorineural hearing loss: case report and literature review [^1124K6Hn]. Otology & Neurotology (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

Is sudden sensorineural hearing loss associated with Lyme disease in adults?

Study Design

A retrospective case report and a systematic literature search in PubMed and Embase were performed.

Results

We describe a patient presenting with sudden sensorineural hearing loss, followed by a facial paralysis, which could be attributed to Lyme disease confirmed by positive serology and a positive immunoblot. She was successfully treated with ceftriaxone, with recovery of the facial paralysis, although no recovery of the hearing loss was observed. A systematic literature search resulted in 4 relevant and valid articles revealing that confirmed positive serology for Borrelia burgdorferi varies from 0% to 21.3%, suggesting active Lyme disease as a cause in patients with sudden sensorineural hearing loss. Two studies demonstrated a significantly higher incidence of confirmed positive serology for Borrelia burgdorferi as compared with the incidence in the general local population.

Conclusion

Literature suggests that sudden sensorineural hearing loss may coincide with Borrelia burgdorferi infection. A higher incidence of confirmed positive serology for Borrelia burgdorferi in patients with sudden deafness seems to be depending on the country and on the tests used to confirm Lyme disease. This should be taken into account if serologic testing for Lyme disease in patients with sudden deafness is considered.

### Mobile hearing testing applications and the diagnosis of sudden sensorineural hearing loss: a cautionary tale [^113T8Dyh]. Otology & Neurotology (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

Mobile hearing applications (apps) are available for hearing testing, personal sound amplification, as well as hearing aid modulation. Hearing testing apps are gaining popularity, especially in resource-limited settings. The reliability of mobile hearing testing apps, however, is not well characterized.

Patients/Interventions

A case study of a single patient with a complaint of sudden hearing loss presenting to a tertiary-care hospital.

Main Outcome Measure

Comparison of a mobile hearing testing app results with standard audiogram.

Results

A commercially available mobile hearing testing app was used after hours to determine if a patient's hearing complaints were consistent with sudden sensorineural hearing loss. The hearing app produced a rudimentary audiogram that was consistent with unilateral SSNHL. Given contraindications to oral treatment, preparations for possible intratympanic dexamethasone after a full audiometric evaluation were completed. Confirmatory audiogram the following day demonstrated normal hearing without evidence of hearing loss. Steroid treatment was aborted and appropriate counseling provided.

Conclusion

While mobile hearing testing apps offer improved access to hearing screening in resource-limited settings, caution must be exercised when interpreting data and making clinical decisions based upon results. The role of professional audiologists remains critical. Further testing and validation of specific apps is required.

### Sudden sensorineural hearing loss in children: clinical characteristics, etiology, treatment outcomes, and prognostic factors [^1137CfUv]. Otology & Neurotology (2019). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Reports on SSNHL in the pediatric population are scarce in the literature. This may not only be related to the low incidence of sudden deafness in this population group but also to poor language expression in children. Currently, no guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of children with SSNHL exist, and so far diagnosis and treatment protocols of childhood SSNHL have been extrapolated from guidelines for the management of sudden hearing loss in adults.

As reported in the literature, unilateral SSNHL was common while bilateral occurrence was rare. In this study, unilateral prevalence rates of sudden deafness in children and adults were 96.0% and 93.3%, respectively. Our finding in the pediatric age group is consistent with that reported by Li et al. who found a unilateral SSNHL prevalence of 80.1% in children. Similarly, Qian et al. reported a unilateral incidence of 96% in children with SSNHL. There is no relevant report on the difference in the onset of sudden unilateral deafness between children and adults. However, in our study, the incidence of pediatric unilateral SSNHL was higher on the right side, and no difference was noted between the right and left side for adult SSNHL patients. This finding is likely due to the relatively small sample size of pediatric patients compared to adult patients.

### Clinical practice guideline: sudden hearing loss (update) [^115cxbES]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Table 9 — Frequently asked questions/patient education for sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL) states that routine labs and x-rays are not recommended and a hearing test should be done; your provider may order magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to screen for tumors and, if the auditory brainstem response (ABR) is abnormal, good practice requires an MRI. Prognosis notes that approximately one-third to two-thirds of patients may recover some hearing within 2 weeks, those who recover half of their hearing in the first 2 weeks have a better prognosis, and patients with minimal change within the first 2 weeks are unlikely to show significant recovery. For management, watchful waiting is an option because between one-third and two-thirds may recover on their own; based on current research, clinicians may offer corticosteroids as initial therapy, hyperbaric oxygen may also be offered within 2 weeks of the initial diagnosis or up to 1 month in conjunction with steroids, and clinicians should offer salvage therapy (usually intratympanic steroids) for incomplete recovery after initial therapy; antivirals have insufficient evidence of effectiveness. Clinicians should obtain follow up audiometry within 6 months of initial diagnosis of SSNHL.

### Ethics of placebo control in trials for idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss [^113BDtoH]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss (ISSHL) involves sudden loss of hearing from cochlear or retrocochlear origin of unknown cause. Systemic corticosteroids may be considered in the management of ISSNHL. However, an updated Cochrane systematic review concludes that "the value of steroids in the treatment of idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss remains unclear since the evidence obtained from randomized controlled trials is contradictory in outcome". Therefore, a new clinical trial that addresses this question is mandatory. A first step in its design is to determine if placebo control would be ethically acceptable. We conclude that there is equipoise (uncertainty) about the use of corticosteroids for ISSHL. A new trial is justified-but with the inclusion of interim analyses to detect early imbalances on efficacy or safety and with the ability to stop the trial if needed.

### Analysis of adherence to AAO-HNSF clinical practice guidelines for sudden hearing loss [^116YJ1A6]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Sudden hearing loss (SHL) is an emergent condition that requires prompt and thorough evaluation to determine the diagnosis. A common type of SHL is sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL), which can occur in up to 27 out of 100,000 people. It is typically unilateral and may be accompanied by tinnitus or vertigo. For some patients, there is an identifiable cause, but in many cases, it is considered to be idiopathic. Early workup and treatment are critical, as individuals with hearing loss may be more likely to have emotional, social, and communication dysfunctions and decreased quality of life (QOL).

In 2019, the American Academy of Otolaryngology‐Head and Neck Surgery (AAO‐HNSF) released clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) for the diagnosis and management of SHL and SSNHL.CPGs are established to ensure adequate workup and optimal patient care. They include action statements accompanied by explanations and supporting evidence. Each statement is given a recommendation for or against it. These guidelines emphasize urgent workup with audiometric testing as a missed or late diagnosis and treatment may lead to a poorer prognosis. This study aimed to assess the adherence to clinical practice guidelines for SHL on a national scale.

### Clinical practice guideline: sudden hearing loss (update) [^111HCeRi]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Sudden hearing loss — Statement 4, audiometric confirmation: In patients with SHL clinicians should obtain, or refer to a clinician who can obtain, audiometry as soon as possible (within 14 days of symptom onset) to confirm the diagnosis of SSNHL. Policy level is Recommendation, with aggregate evidence quality Grade C and a high level of confidence. Risks include potential delay in treatment until audiometry is obtained and direct cost. Exceptions note that when audiometry is not available, clinical judgment based on history, examination, and tuning fork evaluation should be used, and lack of audiometry should not preclude discussion of, and initiation of, treatment. Differences of opinion on timing were noted, with some members preferring within 72 hours and others within 2 weeks. Supporting text states that audiometry is mandatory for definitively diagnosing SSNHL and that a hearing loss ≥ 30 dB at 3 consecutive frequencies occurring within a 72-hour period is a commonly used definition.

### Congress of neurological surgeons systematic review and evidence-based guidelines on the treatment of adults with vestibular schwannomas: executive summary [^111zJBPB]. Neurosurgery (2018). Medium credibility.

Congress of Neurological Surgeons vestibular schwannoma (VS) screening — magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) indications and diagnostic yield are summarized as follows: The first rendition of guidelines ultimately favored the use of MRI for patients with sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) > 10 dB of interaural difference at 2 or more contiguous frequencies or ≥ 15 dB at one frequency, sudden SNHL regardless of how profound, and unilateral tinnitus, and these recommendations were based on level 3 evidence. For tinnitus and sudden SNHL, the recommendations identified that the diagnostic yield of MRI for VS in these cohorts approached 1%, though image screening was advocated to minimize undiagnosed tumors, and recent data sets support an incidence in otologic-complaint cohorts up to 1–3% likely reflecting more liberal screening. MRI offers a high degree of sensitivity such that an existing VS will be detected in virtually all scenarios, and generous screening protocols may therefore lead to MRIs with low diagnostic yields given the presenting symptoms. In isolation, unilateral tinnitus or sudden SNHL have an exceedingly low chance of being caused by a VS (1.56% and 3.66%, respectively), and the chance of VS as a causative lesion in a patient presenting with SNHL > 10 dB at 2 or more contiguous frequencies or ≥ 15 dB at one frequency is merely 1.66%, though in conjunction with tinnitus the risk profile does mildly increase.

### Clinical practice guideline: sudden hearing loss (update) [^113RHqiW]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL) — other pharmacologic therapy: Clinicians should not routinely prescribe antivirals, thrombolytics, vasodilators, or vasoactive substances to patients with SSNHL (strong recommendation). The action statement profile reports aggregate evidence quality as Grade B based on systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials with a high level of confidence, and lists benefits as avoidance of unnecessary treatment, avoidance of adverse events from unnecessary treatment, and cost saving, with risks, harms, and costs noted as none and a benefits-harm assessment of preponderance of harm over benefit. The guideline highlights a quality improvement opportunity in avoiding ineffective treatments and associated risks, complications, side effects, costs, and potential adverse interactions with effective therapies, and clarifies intentional vagueness: the word "routine" is used because there may be patient-specific indications for ≥ 1 of these therapies that may be reasonable to try on an individualized basis with shared decision making. Supporting text states the purpose is to discourage clinicians from routinely using pharmacologic agents that have potential side effects and no documented efficacy in SSNHL.

### Clinical practice guideline: sudden hearing loss [^116aMHji]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

Sudden hearing loss (SHL) is a frightening symptom that often prompts an urgent or emergent visit to a physician. This guideline provides evidence-based recommendations for the diagnosis, management, and follow-up of patients who present with SHL. The guideline primarily focuses on sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL) in adult patients (aged 18 and older). Prompt recognition and management of SSNHL may improve hearing recovery and patient quality of life (QOL). Sudden sensorineural hearing loss affects 5 to 20 per 100,000 population, with about 4000 new cases per year in the United States. This guideline is intended for all clinicians who diagnose or manage adult patients who present with SHL.

Purpose

The purpose of this guideline is to provide clinicians with evidence-based recommendations in evaluating patients with SHL, with particular emphasis on managing SSNHL. The panel recognized that patients enter the health care system with SHL as a nonspecific, primary complaint. Therefore, the initial recommendations of the guideline deal with efficiently distinguishing SSNHL from other causes of SHL at the time of presentation. By focusing on opportunities for quality improvement, the guideline should improve diagnostic accuracy, facilitate prompt intervention, decrease variations in management, reduce unnecessary tests and imaging procedures, and improve hearing and rehabilitative outcomes for affected patients.

Results

The panel made strong recommendations that clinicians should (1) distinguish sensorineural hearing loss from conductive hearing loss in a patient presenting with SHL; (2) educate patients with idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss (ISSNHL) about the natural history of the condition, the benefits and risks of medical interventions, and the limitations of existing evidence regarding efficacy; and (3) counsel patients with incomplete recovery of hearing about the possible benefits of amplification and hearing-assistive technology and other supportive measures. The panel made recommendations that clinicians should (1) assess patients with presumptive SSNHL for bilateral SHL, recurrent episodes of SHL, or focal neurologic findings; (2) diagnose presumptive ISSNHL if audiometry confirms a 30-dB hearing loss at 3 consecutive frequencies and an underlying condition cannot be identified by history and physical examination; (3) evaluate patients with ISSNHL for retrocochlear pathology by obtaining magnetic resonance imaging, auditory brainstem response, or audiometric follow-up; (4) offer intratympanic steroid perfusion when patients have incomplete recovery from ISSNHL after failure of initial management; and (5) obtain follow-up audiometric evaluation within 6 months of diagnosis for patients with ISSNHL. The panel offered as options that clinicians may offer (1) corticosteroids as initial therapy to patients with ISSNHL and (2) hyperbaric oxygen therapy within 3 months of diagnosis of ISSNHL. The panel made a recommendation against clinicians routinely prescribing antivirals, thrombolytics, vasodilators, vasoactive substances, or antioxidants to patients with ISSNHL. The panel made strong recommendations against clinicians (1) ordering computerized tomography of the head/brain in the initial evaluation of a patient with presumptive SSNHL and (2) obtaining routine laboratory tests in patients with ISSNHL.

### Clinical practice guideline: sudden hearing loss (update) [^115gLMcf]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL) initial corticosteroids — Clinicians may offer corticosteroids as initial therapy to patients with SSNHL within 2 weeks of symptom onset, categorized as an Option based on systematic reviews of RCTs and new RCTs and a balance of benefit and harm. Aggregate evidence quality is Grade C and the level of confidence in the evidence is Medium, with the benefit of hearing improvement. Risks for systemic steroids include suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and Cushing's-like syndrome (minimal with 10- to 14-day treatment), aseptic necrosis of the hip, and hyperglycemia, whereas IT corticosteroids have minimal systemic effect but can cause local reactions of pain, tympanic membrane perforation, and transient dizziness, and entail high cost and multiple office visits. Exceptions for systemic steroids include medical conditions affected by corticosteroids, such as insulin-dependent or poorly controlled diabetes, tuberculosis, and peptic ulcer disease. There is a large role for shared decision making with patients, and although several group members were reluctant to endorse the 2-week time frame, the time frame of 2 weeks was retained to encourage early care. The majority of trials use a 1- to 2-week window from symptom onset as the initial therapy.

### Sudden sensorineural hearing loss [^112oREWC]. Lancet (2010). Excellent credibility.

Sudden sensorineural hearing loss is usually unilateral and can be associated with tinnitus and vertigo. In most cases the cause is not identified, although various infective, vascular, and immune causes have been proposed. A careful examination is needed to exclude life threatening or treatable causes such as vascular events and malignant diseases, and patients should be referred urgently for further assessment. About half of patients completely recover, usually in about 2 weeks. Many treatments are used, including corticosteroids, antiviral drugs, and vasoactive and oxygen-based treatments. Although no treatment is proven, we recommend a short course of oral high-dose corticosteroids. There is much to learn about pathogenesis of sudden sensorineural hearing loss, and more clinical trials are needed to establish evidence-based management.

### Rare cause of bilateral sudden deafness [^117DbtPX]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

In this paper, we describe the case of a 62-year-old female with recurring episodes of sudden deafness with vertigo and facial paresis. Within a month's time, this resulted in bilateral deafness and vestibular areflexia. Erroneously, the patient was diagnosed with sudden deafness of unknown origin and subsequently with neuroborreliosis (Lyme disease). The true diagnosis of relapsing polychondritis (RP) was revealed 9months after initial presentation. The diagnostic delay is in part explained by the fact that, by definition, the disease has to relapse before the diagnosis can be made, but also by its pluriform clinical presentation. Timely identification of RP as the cause of this profound sensorineural hearing loss proved to be important. It was key in instigating adequate follow-up, and allowed for cochlear implantation before total cochlear obliteration, which might have hampered optimal hearing rehabilitation.

### Hearing loss in adults: differential diagnosis and treatment [^115DVHvR]. American Family Physician (2019). Medium credibility.

More than 30 million U.S. adults have hearing loss. This condition is underrecognized, and hearing aids and other hearing enhancement technologies are underused. Hearing loss is categorized as conductive, sensorineural, or mixed. Age-related sensorineural hearing loss (i.e., presbycusis) is the most common type in adults. Several approaches can be used to screen for hearing loss, but the benefits of screening are uncertain. Patients may present with self-recognized hearing loss, or family members may observe behaviors (e.g., difficulty understanding conversations, increasing television volume) that suggest hearing loss. Patients with suspected hearing loss should undergo in-office hearing tests such as the whispered voice test or audiometry. Patients should then undergo examination for cerumen impaction, exostoses, and other abnormalities of the external canal and tympanic membrane, in addition to a neurologic examination. Sudden sensorineural hearing loss (loss of 30 dB or more within 72 hours) requires prompt otolaryngology referral. Laboratory evaluation is not indicated unless systemic illness is suspected. Computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging is indicated in patients with asymmetrical hearing loss or sudden sensorineural hearing loss, and when ossicular chain damage is suspected. Treating cerumen impaction with irrigation or curettage is potentially curative. Other aspects of treatment include auditory rehabilitation, education, and eliminating or reducing use of ototoxic medications. Patients with sensorineural hearing loss should be referred to an audiologist for consideration of hearing aids. Patients with conductive hearing loss or sensorineural loss that does not improve with hearing aids should be referred to an otolaryngologist. Cochlear implants can be helpful for those with refractory or severe hearing loss.

### Corticosteroid treatment of idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss: randomized triple-blind placebo-controlled trial [^116f7S9A]. Otology & Neurotology (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the effect of Prednisolone and placebo on the recovery of unilateral idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss.

Study Design

Prospective, randomized, triple-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter trial.

Setting

Four tertiary and 10 secondary referral centers.

Patients

Of 103 patients randomly assigned, 93 were included in the modified intention-to-treat analysis. The patients, aged 18 to 80 years, were seeking care within 1 week after onset of acute unilateral sensorineural hearing loss with a mean decrease of 30 dB or greater in the 3 most affected contiguous frequencies.

Intervention

Patients were randomly assigned in permuted blocks of 10 to receive Prednisolone or placebo in tapering doses from 60 mg for 3 days and, thereafter, 10 mg less each day until Day 8. If complete recovery, no more medication given, otherwise medication continued at 10 mg per day until Day 30. Final follow-up was after 3 months with audiogram; 47 patients received Prednisolone and 46 placebo.

Main Outcome Measure

The primary endpoint was efficacy of treatment on recovery at Day 90. Secondary endpoints were prognostic factors for hearing recovery. Analyses were by modified intention-to-treat and per protocol.

Results

Hearing improvement for 47 Prednisolone-treated patients was 25.5 ± 27.1 dB compared to 26.4 ± 26.2 dB for 46 placebo-treated patients at Day 8 and 39 ± 20.1 dB versus 35.1 ± 38.3 dB after 3 months. Vertigo had significant negative effect on hearing improvement and inflammatory signs in the laboratory workup-a positive prognostic effect, irrespective of treatment.

Conclusion

Prednisolone in customary dosage does not seem to influence recovery of idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss.

### Diagnosis and treatment of sudden-onset sensorineural hearing loss: a study of 51 patients [^11225zL1]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

The study purpose was to determine the efficacy of steroid and antiviral therapy in the management of idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL).

Study Design and Setting

We conducted a retrospective study of patients presenting to an academic tertiary care center. Fifty-one patients were evaluated. All patients were placed on the same treatment protocol.

Results

Thirty-seven patients (73%) had recovery of hearing. Ninety-one percent of patients with vertigo and all patients with mid-frequency hearing loss and up-sloping hearing loss recovered with treatment (P < 0.05). Recovery was significantly related to age, onset of hearing loss, and audiogram type; however outcome was not significantly related to gender, vertigo, tinnitus, or laterality (P < 0.05).

Conclusion

Our treatment protocol produced a recovery rate, which exceeds the spontaneous recovery rate. Unlike prior studies, all patients with up-sloping and mid-frequency SSNHL had recovery. In addition, vertigo did not indicate a poor prognosis.

Significance

Antiviral therapy and increased length of steroid treatment may play a role in the improved recovery rates.

### MR imaging in sudden sensorineural hearing loss. time to talk [^113VccUE]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2017). Low credibility.

Sudden sensorineural hearing loss is defined as acute hearing loss of the sensorineural type of at least 30 dB over 3 contiguous frequencies that occurs within a 72-hour period. Although many different causative factors have been proposed, sudden sensorineural hearing loss is still considered "idiopathic" in 71%-85% of cases, and treatments are empiric, not based on etiology. MR imaging implemented with a 3D FLAIR sequence has provided new insights into the etiology of sudden sensorineural hearing loss. Herein, we review the current management trends for patients with sudden sensorineural hearing loss, from the initial clinical diagnosis to therapeutic strategies and diagnostic work-up. We focused primarily on MR imaging assessment and discuss the relevance that MR imaging findings might have for patient management, pointing out different perspectives for future clinical research.

### Prognostic significance of early posttreatment audiometry in idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss [^113SqUQg]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Our study has several limitations. First, it is a retrospective, relatively small cohort from a single center. As such, it is exposed to selection bias and missing data and may not accurately represent other medical centers. Nevertheless, since all patients were treated with a unanimous protocol and underwent hearing tests in the same institute, we were able to create a homogenous group of ISSHL for comparison. Since ISSHL is, by nature, a relatively rare condition, the magnitude of the cohort is limited.

### Bilateral sudden deafness as a prodrome of anterior inferior cerebellar artery infarction… [^115KAQip]. JAMA Network (2001). Excellent credibility.

A magnetic resonance angiogram showed moderately severe stenosis of the distal vertebral artery and middle third of the basilar artery. The patient's right limb coordination and gait improved steadily over several weeks, but there was no improvement in hearing in his right ear. Conclusions The relatively isolated onset of deafness as well as the severity and persistence of the hearing loss led us to conclude that the hearing loss in this case was likely due to prominent hypoperfusion of the internal auditory artery, with labyrinthine infarction as the earliest event. Vertebrobasilar occlusive disease should be considered in the differential diagnosis of sudden bilateral deafness. SUDDEN DEAFNESS may be defined as more than 20 dB of sensorineural hearing loss occurring over minutes to hours. 1 Sudden deafness occurs unilaterally in most cases, and bilateral, simultaneous, sudden deafness is a rare condition, accounting for 0. 44% to
3. 4%2, 3 of cases of sudden deafness.

Unilateral, sudden deafness in a young patient is usually idiopathic and is often thought to be viral4, 5or autoimmune6 in origin. On the other hand, sudden deafness in an older patient with known cerebrovascular occlusive disease suggests the likelihood of ischemia in the distribution of the internal auditory artery, ordinarily a branch of the anterior inferior cerebellar artery. 7–10 Characteristically, sudden bilateral deafness due to AICA ischemia. Report of a case A 66-year-old man with type 2 diabetes mellitus suddenly developed bilateral hearing loss, tinnitus in his right ear, and vertigo, all of which he noticed when he got up in the morning. He did not have dysarthria, weakness, ataxia, diplopia, dysphagia, Horner syndrome, or sensory loss. On examination, he had a spontaneous left-beating nystagmus with a horizontal-torsional component in primary position and with gaze to the right or left.

There was diminished right-sided facial sensation, a right-sided facial palsy with peripheral features, and dysmetria of the right limbs. Audiometry showed moderate sensorineural hearing loss of 55 dB with 100% speech discrimination on the right and 45 dB with 100% speech discrimination on the left. Electronystagmography showed no response to caloric stimulation of the right ear; and oculomotor testing showed asymmetrical abnormalities of both smooth pursuit and optokinetic nystagmus.

### Sudden hearing loss in children [^111wx59s]. Clinical Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSHL) is defined as a unilateral or bilateral sensorineural hearing loss with at least 30 dB decrease in threshold in 3 contiguous test frequencies occurring over 72 hours or less. It is very rare in children. Sudden hearing loss is a symptom that suggests that there is a problem in the inner ear, surrounding structures, or the whole organism. The etiology and development of this disorder are still not fully understood. The literature contains numerous models of the pathogenesis of SSHL, with childhood SSHL having certain peculiarities. In practical terms, the multifactorial nature of SSHL is important in the choice of diagnostic methods and treatment methods. It is important to determine the cause and effect relationship between the underlying disease and hearing loss.

### Recurrent sudden sensorineural hearing loss sensitive to transtympanic and systemic steroid treatment: case report [^1149ss98]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL) is a rare otologic emergency. Recurrence of this pathology is extremely rare, and its incidence remains unknown. We report the case of a previously healthy 28-year-old man with normal findings on bilateral ear examination who presented with severe unilateral SSNHL. Audiometry demonstrated a pure-tone average of 70 dB and a speech discrimination score of 0% in the affected ear. The patient was treated within hours of the onset of symptoms with an intratympanic injection of dexamethasone and then started on a tapered course of oral prednisone. He experienced a full recovery based on repeat audiometric testing 7 days later. However, 1 year later, the patient experienced a repeat episode of SSNHL in the same ear. Management again included an intratympanic injection and an oral steroid course with good results. A complete metabolic and radiographic evaluation failed to identify a cause of the hearing loss. This case represents a highly unusual instance of recurrent SSNHL of unknown etiology.

An African American man in his 40s initially presented with a sudden-onset unilateral hearing loss with associated vertigo and tinnitus. His medical history was unremarkable, and he specifically had no history of any auditory or vestibular symptoms. Results from his physical examination were also unremarkable and demonstrated normal otoscopic and neurologic findings. Audiometry results revealed a moderate right-sided sensorineural hearing loss across all frequencies. Prior audiograms were unavailable for comparison. The patient was treated with tapered prednisone therapy and scheduled for magnetic resonance imaging radiographic evaluation. Subsequent clinical and audiology evaluations at 1 week and 1 month demonstrated an almost complete resolution of his hearing loss and vertigo symptoms. His MRI was obtained 2 months after onset of his symptoms with the enhancement pattern shown. Jardine DA, Recupero WD, Conley GS. An Unusual Cause of Sudden Hearing Loss.

### Oral steroid regimens for idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss [^113ZNB5X]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine hearing recovery in patients with idiopathic sudden hearing loss treated with varying amounts of oral steroids.

Study Design and Setting

A retrospective chart review (n = 75) in a tertiary care clinic examined sudden hearing loss patients treated with 1 60-mg prednisone taper, 1 course of steroid less than a 60-mg taper, or any 2 courses of oral steroid.

Results

Overall, 35% of the patients recovered a clinically significant amount of hearing. Recovery was associated with immediate treatment (within 2 weeks from onset), better hearing at the onset of treatment, and treatment with the higher dose of prednisone in patients with just 1 additional symptom (dizziness or tinnitus). Patients tended to continue to experience some recovery in hearing up to 4 months after treatment.

Conclusion

Immediate treatment of patients with unilateral idiopathic sudden hearing loss and additional symptoms (dizziness or tinnitus) with a 14-day course of 60 mg prednisone (with taper) is recommended.

Ebm Rating

### Clinical practice guideline: sudden hearing loss (update) [^111ZAz6N]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Guideline scope and purpose — this multidisciplinary update provides evidence-based recommendations for evaluating sudden hearing loss (SHL), with emphasis on sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL), and is intended for clinicians who diagnose and manage adults aged ≥ 18 years in any setting. Initial recommendations address distinguishing sensorineural from conductive hearing loss (CHL) at the time of presentation, including the use of tuning forks, and the purpose is not to present an exhaustive approach to managing CHL. The recommendations are not intended to represent the standard of care or to limit treatment for individual patients, and the guideline is not intended to replace individualized patient care or clinical judgment. This is a multidisciplinary and interprofessional update that will provide evidence-based recommendations based on multidisciplinary consensus and careful consideration of benefits versus harms, aiming to improve diagnostic accuracy, facilitate prompt intervention, decrease inappropriate variations in management, reduce unnecessary tests and imaging procedures, and improve hearing and rehabilitative outcomes for affected patients.

Background

Description of the condition

Idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss (ISSNHL) is a sudden decrease in sensorineural hearing sensitivity of unknown aetiology. It is usually unilateral and the degree of severity can vary from mild hearing loss to total deafness. It may also be accompanied by vertigo and tinnitus.

There is no international consensus on the definition of ISSNHL in terms of the degree of hearing threshold change or the number of specific frequencies that are affected on pure tone audiological testing. A definition that is commonly used is "loss of at least 30 dB in three connected frequencies within 72 hours" (Chandrasekhar 2019; NIDCD 2018). However, this definition is not universally accepted. It does not specify the frequencies and the frequency range, the rational for choosing this threshold is not known and it is often not used as an inclusion criterion in clinical trials on ISSNHL. Although for mild and moderate hearing losses, statistical floor effects complicate the evaluation of recovery (Chen 2003), it appears justified to expand the definition to cases with less than 30 dB of hearing loss (Chandrasekhar 2019; Plontke 2007). There is also a lack of consensus on the most appropriate outcome criteria for clinical studies (Plontke 2007).

The incidence of sudden sensorineural hearing loss has been estimated to be 5 to 20 per 100,000 per year in industrial countries (Byl 1977; Hughes 1996; Stokroos 1996). However, according to studies in Germany, the incidence may be much higher: Olzowy 2005 estimated the incidence at 160 per 100,000 per year and Klemm 2009 estimated it at 400 per 100,000 per year. This discrepancy may be due to the absence of international consensus on the audiological definition and outcome criteria. The mean age of patients included in randomised controlled trials (RCTs) is between 45 and 55. Men and women are equally affected. ISSNHL in childhood is rare (Desloovere 1988; Klemm 2007; Mösges 2009; Plontke 2007; Probst 1992; Tucci 2002; Tran Ba Huy 2005). Idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss, particularly when accompanied by tinnitus and dizziness, results in a significant reduction in quality of life (Carlsson 2011; Stachler 2012).

### Sudden sensorineural hearing loss and vertebrobasilar insufficiency… [^114yxzWc]. JAMA Network (2016). Excellent credibility.

Sudden sensorineural hearing loss is an acute unexplained hearing loss that is often unilateral. The US National Institute for Deafness and Communication Disorders1 defines SSNHL as an idiopathic hearing loss of at least 30 dB over at least 3 test frequencies occurring during a 72-hour period. Vertebrobasilar insufficiency can lead to a wide variety of symptoms, such as vertigo, visual disturbances, drop attack, numbness or tingling, slurred or lost speech, confusion, and swallowing disturbance, mainly owing to impaired perfusion. A conditional logistic regression model was used to estimate the adjusted odds ratios and 95% CIs as a measure of the association between SSNHL and VBI. Potential risk factors for the development of sudden deafness included in the model were hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. Symptoms of VBI vary depending on the severity of the condition.

Common symptoms of VBI include vertigo, transient loss of vision, tinnitus, and numbness. Some patients with SSNHL experience vertigo and tinnitus, in addition to loss of hearing. In those patients, vertigo and tinnitus can persist for months or years after their hearing condition improves following treatment. Sudden sensorineural hearing loss has been shown to be associated with several circulatory system diseases, such as stroke and myocardial infarction. Lin et al10 reported that 12. 7% of 1423 patients with SSNHL had a stroke within 5 years of receiving the diagnosis. In addition, Lee et al18 and Lee and Baloh19 found that sudden deafness with cochlear audiometric features can be the initial presentation of VBI and noted that it was an important sign for the diagnosis of anterior inferior cerebellar artery infarction. The most common causes of VBI are atherosclerosis, embolism, penetrating artery disease, and arterial dissection.

Symptoms depend on the arteries involved and include vertigo, headache, loss of vision, numbness, and weakness. Cases of VBI-related SSNHL have been reported. In a retrospective analysis of 333 patients treated for SSNHL in a tertiary care center during 1999 to 2002, Sauvaget et al17 found that vertebrobasilar occlusive disorders were the cause of SSHL in 4 patients.

### Sudden irreversible hearing loss post COVID-19 [^111Yqt5f]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

Sudden onset sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL) is frequently seen by otolaryngologists. The exact pathophysiology of the disease is still unknown, with the most likely causative factor being following a viral infection. Immediate steroids are the best treatment to improve prognosis. Despite a plethora of papers in the literature describing SSNHL, there are only a few reported cases of hearing loss following COVID-19, none of which have been reported in the UK. This paper presents the first UK case of SSNHL following COVID-19. Physical examination and imaging excluded any other cause of hearing loss. A literature review showed that four other cases have been previously described. Hearing loss can be a significant cause of morbidity and can easily be missed in the intensive care setting. Being aware and screening for SSNHL following COVID-19 enables an early course of steroids, which offers the best chance of recovering hearing.

Sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL) — otoacoustic emissions (OAE) may be used to assess cochlear function and screen for greater-than-mild hearing loss, and in greater-than-mild SSNHL may help distinguish sensory from neural hearing loss, noting that normal responses are usually not obtained with hearing loss greater than 30–40 dB except in those with a neural hearing loss.

### Efficacy and safety of AM-111 in the treatment of acute unilateral sudden deafness – A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled phase 3 study [^116g7Nxj]. Otology & Neurotology (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective:

To confirm the efficacy and safety of AM-111 (brimapitide), a cell-penetrating c-Jun N-terminal Kinase (JNK) inhibitor, in patients suffering from severe to profound acute unilateral idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss (ISSNHL).

Study design:

Prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled phase 3 study with follow-up visits on Days 3, 7, 28, and 91.

Setting:

Fifty-one European and Asian sites (tertiary referral centers, private ENT practices).

Patients:

Two hundred fifty-six patients aged 18 to 65 years presenting within 72 hours following ISSNHL onset with mean hearing loss ≥ 40 dB and mean threshold ≥ 60 dB at the 3 worst affected contiguous test frequencies.

Interventions:

Single-dose intratympanic injection of AM-111 (0.4 or 0.8 mg/ml) or placebo; oral prednisolone as reserve therapy if hearing improvement < 10 dB at Day 7.

Main outcome measures:

Hearing improvement to Day 28 was the primary efficacy endpoint; complete hearing recovery, frequency of reserve therapy used, complete tinnitus remission, improvement in word recognition were secondary endpoints. Safety was evaluated by the frequency of clinically relevant hearing deterioration and adverse events.

Results:

While the primary efficacy endpoint was not met in the overall study population, post-hoc analysis showed a clinically relevant and nominally significant treatment effect for AM-111 0.4 mg/ml in patients with profound ISSNHL. The study drug and the administration procedure were well tolerated.

Conclusions:

AM-111 provides effective otoprotection in case of profound ISSNHL. Activation of the JNK stress kinase, AM-111's pharmacologic target, seems to set in only following pronounced acute cochlear injury associated with large hearing threshold shifts.

### Sudden sensorineural hearing loss in children: a report of 75 cases [^112C3Jqb]. Otology & Neurotology (2018). Low credibility.

Sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL) is rare in children. It is an abrupt hearing loss of more than 30 dB that affects at least three consecutive frequencies with no identifiable cause. The optimum period for speech and language development in children is between the ages of 1 and 6 years; therefore, without immediate treatment, SSNHL can cause serious disorders such as permanent hearing loss and can severely affect children's speech and cognitive development, resulting in psychiatric sequelae that increase the burden on families and society.

SSNHL indicates an abnormality of the cochlea, auditory nerve, or higher aspects of central auditory perception or processing. Up to 90% of SSNHL is idiopathic at presentation and is presumptively attributed to vascular, viral, immunizing, or multiple etiologies. Approximately, 32 to 65% of patients with SSNHL recover spontaneously.

The definitive etiology of SSNHL is unknown, and its treatment is thus controversial. Many studies report therapy options such as systemic and topical steroids, antiviral agents, diuretics, and hyperbaric oxygen treatments for adults. The prognosis for recovery depends on a number of factors including, patient age; presence of vertigo at onset; degree of hearing loss; audiometric configuration; and the time between the onset of hearing loss and treatment. The pathogenesis of SSNHL with various audiometric curves may be different. Treatment options should be based on the audiometric configuration.

Many studies have investigated the causes, treatments, and prognostic factors of SSNHL in adults, but few studies on children have been reported because of the low incidence of SSNHL in this population. Current guidelines for SSNHL diagnosis and treatment are proposed for adults. The lack of standardization in approaches to the diagnosis and treatment of SSNHL in children leaves them vulnerable to the most efficacious therapy during a critical window of their lives. Pediatric literatures on children have discussed only the benefits of oral steroids in a small number of patients, and the data on intratympanic or postauricular steroid administration are lack.

We retrospectively analyzed the data of 75 cases of SSNHL in children to study the clinical characteristics, efficacy, treatment, and prognostic factors associated with different audiometric configurations.
