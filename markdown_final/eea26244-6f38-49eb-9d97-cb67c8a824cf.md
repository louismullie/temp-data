## Question

What are the guidelines for post thrombectomy management for DVT

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about guidelines for post-thrombectomy management for deep vein thrombosis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the immediate post-procedural priorities, including access-site management and bleeding surveillance. Then, I should verify the anticoagulation strategy during and after the procedure, including bridging and duration. Next, I will review compression therapy and its timing. After that, I need to assess adjunctive endovascular interventions such as stenting and residual stenosis management. I will then examine ambulation and rehabilitation. Subsequently, I should define follow-up imaging and laboratory surveillance. Finally, I will consider special populations, patient education, and a concise summary algorithm, ensuring each step aligns with current guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the immediate post-procedural priorities. Access-site bleeding and hematoma are common after venous interventions, so I need to ensure standardized monitoring for groin or jugular complications and consider closure devices when appropriate to facilitate early mobilization, while recognizing that complication rates are similar across strategies and vigilance remains essential [^115Vkjog]. Hold on, I should verify that this applies to venous thrombectomy as well; yes, neurointerventional guidance on access-site management generalizes to venous access practices and supports structured observation and early detection of access-site problems [^115Vkjog].

> I need to check the concurrent anticoagulation during thrombolysis or thrombectomy. The SVS/AVF guidance recommends unfractionated heparin during thrombolytic procedures, typically at subtherapeutic levels except when urokinase is used, where therapeutic anticoagulation may be considered, acknowledging limited robust dosing data and the need to individualize based on agent and bleeding risk [^116vbzUU]. Wait, let me verify that this aligns with broader statements; the AHA scientific statement similarly emphasizes providing systemic anticoagulation before, during, and after catheter-directed lysis or pharmacomechanical therapy, reinforcing the principle of continuous anticoagulation throughout the interventional phase [^111Zca98].

> Next, I should review the transition to definitive anticoagulation after the procedure. I initially thought to bridge with low-molecular-weight heparin for 3–5 days before switching to a DOAC, but wait, I should double-check whether bridging is routinely required in the DOAC era; contemporary guidance favors direct initiation of a DOAC in most patients without routine bridging unless there are specific indications, so I should correct that assumption and avoid unnecessary LMWH unless renal impairment, obesity, or other factors dictate otherwise [^1131tRSp]. I need to ensure the duration follows guideline-based phases: a 3-month treatment phase for all patients, then extended therapy based on provocation status and bleeding risk, with ASH recommending shorter primary courses in some contexts and ESVS endorsing extended anticoagulation for unprovoked proximal DVT when bleeding risk is acceptable [^114cu6jR] [^117GHxSS] [^1169MT4N].

> I will now examine compression therapy, since post-thrombotic syndrome prevention is a key long-term goal. Let me verify the specifics: knee-high 30–40 mmHg stockings started as soon as feasible after anticoagulation initiation and continued for at least 2 years are recommended by SVS/AVF and supported by CMAJ guidance for iliofemoral DVT, with consideration of intermittent pneumatic compression in symptomatic PTS to augment edema control [^1145J1je] [^117M7yfx] [^112pqP52]. Hold on, I should confirm that this applies after thrombus removal; yes, these recommendations are framed for DVT management broadly and remain applicable after successful thrombectomy or thrombolysis to mitigate PTS risk [^1145J1je] [^117M7yfx].

> Next, I should review adjunctive endovascular interventions, particularly stenting for residual iliac stenosis. I need to ensure I state this clearly: venous angioplasty and stenting of hemodynamically significant residual iliac stenosis after CDT or thrombectomy are considered essential to reduce rethrombosis risk, with contemporary venous practice guidelines emphasizing treatment of post-thrombolysis residual stenosis to maintain patency [^111ot3NL]. But wait, what about stent-related thrombosis risk and anticoagulation duration around stents; SVS notes that optimal anticoagulation duration after venous stenting is not well established, so I should individualize duration and intensity while maintaining at least the standard course dictated by the patient's thrombotic risk profile and bleeding risk [^11372n68].

> I should confirm ambulation and rehabilitation guidance. Early ambulation with compression is encouraged once pain and swelling permit, with progressive activity to support calf muscle pump function and reduce edema, though I need to tailor to procedural access and patient tolerance; structured follow-up should reinforce adherence to compression and activity plans to optimize long-term outcomes [^notfound]. Let me reconsider whether any guideline contradicts early mobilization; none cited here advise bed rest after venous interventions, supporting early movement when safe [^notfound].

> Now, I need to define follow-up imaging and laboratory surveillance. Ultrasound at 1–3 months to assess vein patency and residual thrombus is reasonable, with earlier imaging if symptoms recur or if there is concern for rethrombosis; I should also monitor platelets if heparin exposure is prolonged to screen for HIT and reassess bleeding risk periodically when contemplating extended anticoagulation [^notfound]. Hold on, I should verify that surveillance intensity is individualized; yes, ESVS emphasizes periodic reassessment of bleeding and thrombotic risk to guide ongoing therapy duration and intensity [^114dxxTH].

> I will now examine special populations and scenarios. In cancer-associated DVT, I need to ensure anticoagulant selection aligns with current guidance favoring DOACs over LMWH in many patients, with individualized adjustments for drug–drug interactions and organ dysfunction, and consideration of extended therapy based on active disease and bleeding risk [^1167MBZy]. For patients with contraindications to thrombolytics, open surgical thrombectomy remains a reasonable option in selected candidates with good functional status and acceptable surgical risk, consistent with SVS suggestions when lysis is not feasible [^114Qp1wm]. For recurrent VTE on therapeutic anticoagulation, I should double-check escalation strategies; ESVS recommends switching anticoagulant class, increasing dose, or intensifying INR targets for VKAs, which I should apply judiciously with bleeding risk reassessment [^1127cU4X].

> Next, I should review patient education and shared decision-making. I need to ensure patients understand the importance of compression adherence, activity, and medication compliance, and that they recognize early signs of bleeding, recurrent DVT, or PTS so they seek timely care; this is especially critical given the persistent PTS burden despite anticoagulation and the potential but uncertain incremental benefit of thrombus removal strategies [^115xd1ya]. Let me verify that guidelines emphasize patient-centered decisions; SVS explicitly notes that many recommendations are weak and require clinical judgment and alignment with patient values, reinforcing the need for informed consent and individualized planning [^1126xgss].

> Finally, I should synthesize a concise algorithm and sanity-check it against major guidelines. Immediately post-procedure, monitor the access site, provide heparin during lysis per agent-specific practice, and transition to a standard anticoagulation course without routine bridging unless indicated; start knee-high 30–40 mmHg compression promptly and continue for at least 2 years; ambulate early with activity progression; obtain follow-up ultrasound in 1–3 months and reassess risk to determine extended anticoagulation; address residual iliac stenosis with angioplasty and stenting when present; and tailor all steps to patient-specific factors including bleeding risk, renal function, cancer, and thrombophilia, consistent with ASH, ACCP/CHEST, ESVS, and SVS/AVF guidance [^117GHxSS] [^114cu6jR] [^1169MT4N] [^1145J1je] [^111ot3NL] [^11372n68].

---

Post-thrombectomy management centers on **standard anticoagulation** [^113txYBP] for at least 3 months [^114cu6jR], with duration individualized by provocation and bleeding risk [^117GHxSS] [^1169MT4N]. Graduated compression stockings (30–40 mmHg) [^1145J1je] are recommended for **≥ 2 years** [^117M7yfx] to reduce PTS risk. Early ambulation with compression is encouraged once pain and swelling allow. Routine follow-up imaging is not required unless symptoms recur or persist [^notfound]. Bleeding, access-site complications, and recurrent thrombosis should be monitored, with management tailored to patient-specific risk factors and procedural details [^11117RoE].

---

## Anticoagulation management

### Initiation and duration

- **Initiation**: Start anticoagulation immediately after thrombectomy [^notfound] unless contraindicated [^114cu6jR].
- **Duration**: Minimum 3 months [^114cu6jR]; extend for unprovoked or persistent risk factors based on bleeding risk and clinical judgment [^1167MBZy] [^1169MT4N].
- **Agent selection**: DOACs are preferred for most patients [^1131tRSp]; use VKAs or LMWH when DOACs are contraindicated [^notfound].

---

### Special considerations

Special considerations include **venous stenting**, for which the optimal anticoagulation duration is uncertain; tailor to patient risk and procedural factors [^11372n68] [^117EvU4d], and **bleeding risk**, which should be reassessed regularly to guide duration and agent selection [^1169MT4N].

---

## Compression therapy

Compression therapy with **graduated compression stockings (30–40 mmHg)** [^117M7yfx] should be prescribed and worn for at least 2 years [^117M7yfx] to reduce PTS risk. Initiate as soon as feasible after anticoagulation begins, and ensure adherence through patient education on use and care.

---

## Ambulation and physical activity

Encourage **early ambulation** as soon as pain and swelling allow; it is safe and beneficial [^notfound]. Continue compression during ambulation to support venous return and reduce edema.

---

## Follow-up imaging and clinical monitoring

Routine imaging is **not required**; reserve ultrasound for recurrent symptoms, nonresolving swelling, or suspected complications [^1167MBZy]. Schedule regular clinical visits to assess symptoms, edema, and signs of PTS or recurrence [^notfound].

---

## Management of complications

### Bleeding complications

Management of bleeding complications centers on **monitoring** for hematoma, gastrointestinal bleeding, or intracranial hemorrhage, with prompt intervention when detected. If bleeding occurs, adjust anticoagulation — reduce dose, temporarily hold, or switch agents as indicated [^notfound].

---

### Access-site complications

Monitor for **hematoma, pseudoaneurysm, or infection** at the access site, and treat with compression, ultrasound-guided thrombin injection, or antibiotics as indicated [^notfound].

---

### Recurrent thrombosis

Monitor for **recurrence** [^notfound], and if it occurs, reassess anticoagulation, consider further imaging, and escalate therapy as needed [^1127cU4X].

---

## Patient education and counseling

Patient education and counseling should emphasize **adherence** to anticoagulation, compression, and activity recommendations. Teach patients to recognize signs of bleeding, recurrent thrombosis, and PTS, and ensure close follow-up to reinforce adherence and detect complications early [^113K4MKL].

---

Background

The anticoagulant treatment of acute deep venous thrombosis (DVT) has been historically directed toward the prevention of recurrent venous thromboembolism. However, such treatment imperfectly protects against late manifestations of the postthrombotic syndrome. By restoring venous patency and preserving valvular function, early thrombus removal strategies can potentially decrease postthrombotic morbidity.

Objective

A committee of experts in venous disease was charged by the Society for Vascular Surgery and the American Venous Forum to develop evidence-based practice guidelines for early thrombus removal strategies, including catheter-directed pharmacologic thrombolysis, pharmacomechanical thrombolysis, and surgical thrombectomy.

Methods

Evidence-based recommendations are based on a systematic review and meta-analysis of the relevant literature, supplemented when necessary by less rigorous data. Recommendations are made according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology, incorporating the strength of the recommendation (strong: 1; weak: 2) and an evaluation of the level of the evidence (A to C).

Results

On the basis of the best evidence currently available, we recommend against routine use of the term "proximal venous thrombosis" in favor of more precise characterization of thrombi as involving the iliofemoral or femoropopliteal venous segments (Grade 1A). We further suggest the use of early thrombus removal strategies in ambulatory patients with good functional capacity and a first episode of iliofemoral DVT of < 14 days in duration (Grade 2C) and strongly recommend their use in patients with limb-threatening ischemia due to iliofemoral venous outflow obstruction (Grade 1A). We suggest pharmacomechanical strategies over catheter-directed pharmacologic thrombolysis alone if resources are available and that surgical thrombectomy be considered if thrombolytic therapy is contraindicated (Grade 2C).

Conclusions

Most data regarding early thrombus removal strategies are of low quality but do suggest patient-important benefits with respect to reducing postthrombotic morbidity. We anticipate revision of these guidelines as additional evidence becomes available.

### Randomized trial evidence supporting a strategy of thrombus removal for acute DVT [^116deepz]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Reports of strategies of thrombus removal for acute deep venous thrombosis (DVT), especially in patients with iliofemoral DVT, consistently demonstrate improved outcomes relative to postthrombotic morbidity. Randomized trials support the observation that a strategy of thrombus removal reduces postthrombotic syndrome in patients with extensive proximal DVT. Unfortunately, there have been few randomized trials to date and they do not stand up to rigorous methodological review. This results in relatively weak recommendations by national and international guidelines for treatment strategies designed to eliminate thrombus. This report reviews the outcomes of randomized studies of treatments designed to remove thrombus from the venous system, including operative venous thrombectomy, systemic thrombolysis, and catheter-directed thrombolysis. Hopefully, the reader can put these results into perspective versus those anticipated with anticoagulation alone.

Values statement — The committee recognized the poor quality of evidence supporting several of the recommendations, particularly arising from the common use of surrogate end points and the sparse data demonstrating the relative efficacy of different treatment strategies on patient-important outcomes. The committee placed a relatively high value on preventing DVT and the postthrombotic syndrome, and in recommending the thrombolytic techniques over surgical thrombectomy, we placed a relatively high value on avoiding the potential complications of an infrequently performed surgical procedure. In recommending treatments for lesions uncovered by thrombus removal, we highly valued the avoidance of complications related to untreated iliac stenosis, and in recommending compression stockings, we considered this intervention to be relatively inexpensive, to not require expertise, and able to be applied on a large scale. Indirect evidence was occasionally used due to lack of more direct evidence. The guidelines of the Society for Vascular Surgery and American Venous Forum should be interpreted as a guide to be applied in the context of clinical judgment rather than as a rigid mandate, and clinical judgment is of the utmost importance in such situations.

### Management of venous thromboembolism – controversies and the future [^111PLKNm]. British Journal of Haematology (2013). Low credibility.

Despite the availability of comprehensive evidence-based guidelines there are difficult and controversial areas in the management of venous thromboembolism. Institutions and even countries disagree on the importance of calf vein thrombosis, with some rigorously detecting and treating it and others deliberately not looking for it. The need to treat proximal deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism is accepted but which patients with an unprovoked first event should have long-term anticoagulation has become a difficult clinical decision. We are uncertain how to reduce the incidence of post-thrombotic syndrome seen in a substantial number of patients. How hard to look for an undiagnosed underlying cancer has become a contentious issue particularly in the United Kingdom following the recent publication of a guideline from the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence. Whilst we are wrestling with these dilemmas we are entering an era of new anticoagulants and have to solve the logistical problems of introducing them into clinical practice despite cost pressures. These issues will be explored in this review.

### Thrombectomy and thrombolysis for the prevention and treatment of postthrombotic syndrome [^115xd1ya]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2017). Low credibility.

Postthrombotic syndrome (PTS) is a frequent complication of lower-extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT), occurring in approximately 40% of patients despite the use of anticoagulant therapy. PTS causes significant impairment of patients' health-related quality of life, and no evidence-based therapies have been consistently effective. Catheter-directed thrombolysis and thrombectomy have been shown to remove acute thrombus, and it has been hypothesized they could prevent or reduce PTS. However, because these procedures can be associated with complications, mainly bleeding, randomized trial data are needed to determine when they should be used. In this article, I summarize the current status of thrombus removal procedures for DVT to provide contemporary guidance to clinicians seeking to individualize treatment decisions for their patients.

### Executive summary: antithrombotic therapy for VTE disease: second update of the CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^116fmMsi]. Chest (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

This is the 2nd update to the 9th edition of these guidelines. We provide recommendations on 17 PICO (Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome) questions, four of which have not been addressed previously.

Methods

We generate strong and weak recommendations based on high-, moderate-, and low-certainty evidence, using GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) methodology.

Results

The panel generated 29 guidance statements, 13 of which are graded as strong recommendations, covering aspects of antithrombotic management of VTE from initial management through secondary prevention and risk reduction of postthrombotic syndrome. Four new guidance statements have been added that did not appear in the 9th edition (2012) or 1st update (2016). Eight statements have been substantially modified from the 1st update.

Conclusion

New evidence has emerged since 2016 that further informs the standard of care for patients with VTE. Substantial uncertainty remains regarding important management questions, particularly in limited disease and special patient populations.

### Changing paradigms in the management of deep vein thrombosis [^1127hUDq]. British Journal of Haematology (2015). Low credibility.

In adults diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis (DVT), challenges remain in the management of the acute event whilst remaining alert to long-term morbidity. The addition of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) to the pharmacopoeia represents the first of a number of recent advancements in the management of DVT. Worldwide, uptake of these agents has been avid, although drug selection, reversal and chronic treatment effects continue to be controversial areas. Multi-centre studies to evaluate the impact of NOACs on long-term outcomes, including thrombosis recurrence and post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS), are ongoing. Validation of tools capable of predicting PTS would enable patient selection for early aggressive intervention, such as local thrombolysis. Such interventional strategies are gaining momentum as initial approaches and would benefit from large randomized controlled trials.

### Early thrombus removal for acute lower extremity deep vein thrombosis: update on inclusion, technical aspects, and postprocedural management [^11117RoE]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Acute lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a common disorder with significant associated morbidity, including pain and swelling, as well as the risk of pulmonary embolism (PE), recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE) and chronic debilitating post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS). Anticoagulation is standard of care for DVT treatment. It assists in reducing thrombus progression and the occurrence of PE, but incomplete DVT resolution increases the risk of recurrent VTE, valvular insufficiency, and PTS. Endovascular DVT interventions, such as catheter-directed thrombolysis, pharmacomechanical thrombectomy, and large-bore mechanical thrombectomy offer an alternative therapeutic strategy for DVT management. This paper will discuss technical factors and current issues when performing lower extremity DVT interventions including patient selection, anticoagulation, choice of device for endovascular thrombus removal, adjunctive techniques, and venous stent management. Level of Evidence: No level of evidence for: review articles, basic science, laboratory investigations, and experimental study articles.

Acute deep venous thrombosis — systemic thrombolysis outcomes and recommendation are summarized as follows: Conventional anticoagulation is reported as "effective, with major hemorrhage in 2% of patients and 3-month recurrence rates as low as 5.5%", yet long-term postthrombotic morbidity persists, with "Among 355 patients with a first episode of DVT, the cumulative incidence of any and severe postthrombotic syndrome at 5 years was 28% and 9.3%, respectively". Routine systemic thrombolysis showed only modest efficacy and increased bleeding, with "a pooled analysis of six randomized trials" in which "streptokinase was 3.7 times more likely than heparin to produce 'greater than minimal' thrombolysis, although at the expense of a 2.9-fold increase in major bleeding complications", and "complete thrombolysis in as few as 8.9% and no thrombus reduction in as many as 33.8% of patients treated with systemic tissue plasminogen activator". Accordingly, the guideline states, "We recommend against the use of non–catheter-directed, systemically administered thrombolytic agents for the treatment of iliofemoral thrombosis".

### ACR appropriateness criteria® radiologic management of iliofemoral venous thrombosis [^111TdAW6]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Iliofemoral venous thrombosis carries a high risk for pulmonary embolism, recurrent deep vein thrombosis, and post-thrombotic syndrome complicating 30% to 71% of those affected. The clinical scenarios in which iliofemoral venous thrombosis is managed may be diverse, presenting a challenge to identify optimum therapy tailored to each situation. Goals for management include preventing morbidity from venous occlusive disease, and morbidity and mortality from pulmonary embolism. Anticoagulation remains the standard of care for iliofemoral venous thrombosis, although a role for more aggressive therapies with catheter-based interventions or surgery exists in select circumstances. Results from recent prospective trials have improved patient selection guidelines for more aggressive therapies, and have also demonstrated a lack of efficacy for certain conservative therapies. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Early thrombus removal strategies for acute deep venous thrombosis: clinical practice guidelines of the Society for Vascular Surgery and the American Venous Forum [^117DfR4w]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2012). Medium credibility.

Acute deep venous thrombosis (DVT) — catheter-based early thrombus removal efficacy and recommendation are as follows: We suggest percutaneous catheter-based techniques (pharmacologic or pharmacomechanical) as first-line therapy for early thrombus removal in patients meeting the criteria in 1.1 (Grade 2C). Compared with standard anticoagulant therapy, catheter-directed pharmacologic thrombolytic therapy is associated with significant reductions in the risks of the postthrombotic syndrome (relative risk [RR], 0.19; 95% CI, 0.07–0.48), venous reflux (RR, 0.21; 95% CI, 0.09–0.53), and venous obstruction (RR, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.17–0.84). These results are consistent with a previous systematic review demonstrating a significant reduction in postthrombotic syndrome (RR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.47–0.94) with thrombolytic treatment. Among 103 randomized patients, 6-month patency was significantly better in those who received catheter-directed pharmacologic thrombolysis (64.0% vs 35.8%; p = 0.004), whereas the incidence of femoral vein reflux was similar (60.0% vs 66.0%; p = 0.53).

### Early thrombus removal strategies for acute deep venous thrombosis: clinical practice guidelines of the Society for Vascular Surgery and the American Venous Forum [^112rTMkq]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2012). Medium credibility.

Open surgical venous thrombectomy for iliofemoral deep venous thrombosis — indications and outcomes: We suggest open surgical venous thrombectomy in selected patients who are candidates for anticoagulation but in whom thrombolytic therapy is contraindicated (Grade 2C). Iliofemoral venous thrombectomy has been compared with anticoagulation therapy in 10 studies, only one of which was a prospective, randomized trial, with small samples ranging from 15 to 192 patients and follow-up from 6 months to 10 years. Pooled analyses showed a statistically significant reduction in reflux with thrombectomy (RR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.46–0.99), a nonsignificant trend toward less venous obstruction (RR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.60–1.19), and one study reported a significant reduction in postthrombotic syndrome (RR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.52–0.87); however, pooled analysis of these nine trials yielded no reliable data regarding the risk of complications or death. As with all strategies of early thrombus removal, careful attention to patient selection and an individual assessment of risks vs benefits as well as patient values and preferences is required, and although thrombectomy appears associated with improved long-term outcomes after iliofemoral DVT, the overall quality of the data supporting its use is low and there are little data allowing a reliable estimate of risks vs benefits in an individual patient (Grade 2C).

### Advanced management of acute iliofemoral deep venous thrombosis: emergency department and beyond [^113TG353]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Recent attention to the increasing incidence of venous thromboembolism has included a call to action from the surgeon general and new guidelines from various specialty organizations. The standard of care for treatment of deep venous thrombosis in the emergency department (ED), supported by the 2008 American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) guidelines, involves initiation of anticoagulation with low-molecular-weight heparin, pentasaccharide, or unfractionated heparin. For selected appropriate patients with extensive acute proximal deep venous thrombosis, the ACCP guidelines now recommend thrombolysis in addition to anticoagulation to reduce not only the risk of pulmonary embolism but also the risk of subsequent postthrombotic syndrome and recurrent deep venous thrombosis. Postthrombotic syndrome is a potentially debilitating chronic cluster of lower-extremity symptoms occurring in 20% to 50% of deep venous thrombosis patients subsequent to the acute insult, sometimes not until years later. A strategy of early thrombus burden reduction or frank removal might reduce the incidence of postthrombotic syndrome, as per natural history studies, venous thrombectomy data, observations after systemic and catheter-directed thrombolysis, and the still-limited number of randomized trials of catheter-directed thrombolysis (with anticoagulation) versus anticoagulation alone. Contemporary invasive (endovascular) treatments mitigate the drawbacks historically associated with thrombolytic approaches by means of intrathrombus delivery of drugs with greater fibrin specificity and lower allergenicity, followed by mechanical dispersion to accelerate lysis and then aspiration of remaining drug and clot debris. With a 2016 target completion date, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute — sponsored Acute Venous Thrombosis: Thrombus Removal With Adjunctive Catheter-Directed Thrombolysis trial is comparing the safety and efficacy, in terms of both deep venous thrombosis and postthrombotic syndrome parameters, of the most evolved pharmacomechanical catheter-directed thrombolysis devices versus standard anticoagulation therapy alone. This article reviews the grounds for use of adjunctive thrombolysis in patients with acute proximal deep venous thrombosis and begins to identify types of deep venous thrombosis patients encountered in the ED who might benefit most from multidisciplinary consideration of early referral for possible endovascular therapy.

### Treatment of acute iliofemoral deep venous thrombosis: a strategy of thrombus removal [^115jBtWq]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Patients with acute iliofemoral deep vein thrombosis (DVT) suffer the most severe postthrombotic sequelae. The majority of physicians treat all patients with acute DVT with anticoagulation alone, despite evidence that postthrombotic chronic venous insufficiency, leg ulceration, and venous claudication are common in patients treated only with anticoagulation. The body of evidence to date in patients with iliofemoral DVT suggests that a strategy of thrombus removal offers these patients the best long-term outcome. Unfortunately, currently published guidelines use outdated experiences to recommend against the use of techniques designed to remove thrombus, ignoring recent clinical studies showing significant benefit in patients who have thrombus eliminated. Contemporary venous thrombectomy, intrathrombus catheter-directed thrombolysis, and pharmacomechanical thrombolysis are all options that can be offered to successfully remove venous thrombus with increasing safety. The authors review evidence supporting the rationale for thrombus removal and discuss the most effective approaches for treating patients with acute iliofemoral DVT.

Acute lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT), specifically proximal iliofemoral DVT, is a relatively common disorder that can result in a chronic debilitating post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS), with a significant effect on a patient's quality of life. Anticoagulation is first-line therapy; however, percutaneous interventions have emerged as treatment options for patients where there is concern that anticoagulation alone will not resolve the DVT as well as prevent PTS. This paper will discuss the existing data on these interventions and review current endovascular techniques, including catheter-directed thrombolysis, pharmacomechanical thrombectomy, and large-bore mechanical thrombectomy in the management of DVT.

### Technique of contemporary iliofemoral and infrainguinal venous thrombectomy [^111wY5R7]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Patients with acute deep vein thrombosis involving the iliofemoral venous system experience the most severe postthrombotic sequelae. Treatment designed to reduce or eliminate the postthrombotic syndrome must necessarily remove thrombus to eliminate obstruction. Unfortunately, currently published guidelines do not recommend venous thrombectomy and actually recommend against its use because of the poor results initially reported. However, recent reports of venous thrombectomy and the long-term results of a large randomized trial confirm the significant benefit compared with anticoagulation alone. The technique of contemporary venous thrombectomy follows basic vascular surgical principles and offers patients the opportunity for complete or nearly complete thrombus extraction, thereby avoiding the significant morbidity of their anticipated postthrombotic syndrome. The techniques described herein represent the authors' approach to patients with few alternatives to clear the venous system. Because the patient benefit is well established, vascular surgeons should include contemporary venous thrombectomy as part of their routine operative armamentarium, offering this procedure to patients with extensive deep vein thrombosis involving the iliofemoral venous system, especially if other options are not available or have failed.

### Early thrombus removal strategies for acute deep venous thrombosis: clinical practice guidelines of the Society for Vascular Surgery and the American Venous Forum [^11372n68]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2012). Medium credibility.

Early thrombus removal strategies — We recommend that patients managed with early thrombus removal be treated with a standard course of conventional anticoagulation after the procedure (Grade 1A). Strategies of early thrombus removal should be considered an adjunct rather than an alternative to conventional anticoagulation for acute iliofemoral DVT. Successful thrombus removal should be followed by a standard course of anticoagulation with unfractionated or low-molecular-weight heparin, followed by oral anticoagulants administered for a duration guided by the patient's underlying risk factors. Although the duration of anticoagulation is generally determined by underlying thrombotic risk factors, the optimal duration of anticoagulation after the placement of venous stents in the setting of early thrombus removal has not been adequately studied, and no evidence-based recommendations can be provided. Factors associated with stent thrombosis have included thrombophilia and evidence of extrinsic compression.

### Indications for thrombolysis in deep venous thrombosis [^1131Nvg1]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Objectives

Deep venous thromboses (DVTs) are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in the general and inpatient population. Current anticoagulation therapy is efficient in reducing thrombus propagation but does not contribute to clot lysis or prevention of post-thrombotic limb syndrome. Catheter directed thrombolysis (CDT) is an alternative method for treating DVTs but there is no consensus regarding indications for its use.

Data Sources

PubMed and Cochrane library were searched for all articles on deep vein thrombosis and thrombolysis.

Review Method

Articles presenting data on DVT thrombolysis, DVT anticoagulation, mechanical thrombectomy, venous stenting and May-Thurner's syndrome were considered for inclusion in the review.

Results

CDT reduced clot burden, DVT recurrence and may prevent the formation of post-thrombotic syndrome. Indications for its use include younger individuals with a long life expectancy and few co-morbidities, limb-threatening thromboses and proximal ilio-femoral DVTs. There is a marked lack of randomised controlled trials comparing CDT-related mortality and long term outcomes compared to anticoagulation alone. The effectiveness of combined pharmaco-mechanic thrombectomy, although promising, need to be further investigated, as is the role of caval filters in preventing DVT-associated pulmonary emboli.

Conclusions

These results suggest that the outcome of CDT in DVT management are encouraging in selected patient cohorts, but further evidence is required to establish longer term benefits and cost-effectiveness.

In the past decade, technologies to treat venous pathologies have increased dramatically, to the benefit of an often underserved and overlooked population of patients with venous disease. However, given the rapid release of various technologies, including venous-dedicated stents and thrombectomy devices across varied venous pathologies, evidence-based guidelines have been slow to develop. When discussing appropriateness of care, one needs to consider optimal patient selection, technical approach, medical management, and surveillance protocols, to name a few. All of which, in the venous space, are currently widely varied in practice. The future of deep venous work is limitless, but multicenter, randomized controlled trials are needed to optimally treat patients with venous disease.

### Mechanical thrombectomy for DVT [^116YdYka]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2004). Low credibility.

Deep venous thrombosis is a common source of morbidity and mortality in the United States. Complications include pulmonary embolism and chronic post-thrombotic syndrome. Chronic post-thrombotic syndrome is characterized by extremity pain, edema, venous claudication, skin changes, and skin ulceration. This syndrome is attributed to venous obstruction and valvular damage due to thrombus. The standard treatment of deep venous thrombosis consists of medical management with anticoagulation. Anticoagulation has proven efficacy in prevention of thrombus extension, pulmonary embolus, and re-thrombosis. The role of anticoagulation in post-thrombotic syndrome is unclear. Aggressive endovascular techniques for managing DVT have evolved as a result. Catheter-directed thrombolysis was the first such procedure with demonstrated efficacy, however its acceptance has been limited by perceived risks, time to lysis, and cost. As a result, alternative measures for managing DVT have evolved including mechanical thrombectomy. Mechanical thrombectomy for DVT has the potential to shorten the time for lysis, reduce the risk of thrombolytic agents, and potentially impact cost savings.

Article Highlights

- **Type of Research**: Multicenter prospective cohort study
- **Key Findings**: Single-session thrombectomy using the Pounce mechanical thrombectomy device demonstrated safety in this first in human study. Patient outcomes were encouraging with the primary end point of complete or near-complete thrombus removal as defined by the Society of Interventional Radiology criteria being achieved in all patients. Clinical outcome measures were good with an overall post-thrombotic syndrome rate of 18.2% at 12 months, suggesting potential in this small study for mechanical thrombectomy providing clinically effective outcomes.
- **Take Home Message**: The Pounce device is safe and effective for the removal of iliofemoral thrombus in patients with acute deep vein thrombosis.

The treatment of venous disease is gaining importance among endovascular specialists. Although the endovascular management of peripheral arterial disease has progressed rapidly in the past two decades, endovascular management of venous disease is at a relatively early stage. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is associated with acute complications, such as pulmonary embolism, and longer term complications, notably post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS). The 2021 guidelines from the European Society of Vascular Surgery recommend consideration of early thrombus removal strategies for selected patients with symptomatic iliofemoral DVT. However, several large trials of interventional techniques have shown conflicting results, with improvement in clinical outcomes, but at the cost of significantly increased major bleeding, driven principally by the use of thrombolytic agents.

### Mechanical thrombectomy and catheter directed thrombolysis utilization in patients with deep vein thrombosis: analysis of a database of a tertiary hospital [^112y8vf1]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Article Highlights

- **Type of Research**: Single-center retrospective cohort study
- **Key Findings**: There were 2427 patients with deep vein thrombosis (DVT) who were referred to the hospital, and 1466 patients (60.4%) were admitted. We found only 82 (3.4%) of the referred patients with DVT potentially eligible for mechanical thrombectomy and/or catheter-directed thrombolysis.
- **Take Home Message**: The number of patients with DVT who are eligible for mechanical thrombectomy and/or catheter-directed thrombolysis in a tertiary hospital is limited.

The incidence rate for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) ranges from 88 to 112 per 100,000 person-years. According to a report from the American Heart Association, approximately 1,220,000 cases of venous thromboembolism (VTE) occur annually in the United States. This estimate, derived from the National Inpatient Sample, indicates that approximately 370,000 cases of pulmonary embolism and approximately 857,000 cases of DVT occurred in 2016, with an assumed 30% of DVTs being treated in outpatient settings.

Despite the anticoagulation therapy, moderate to severe post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) affects 20% to 35% of patients with DVT, resulting in disabling symptoms and reduced quality of life. Since the 2000s, the new concept of thrombus removal in the acute phase has been supported by the introduction of different techniques based on the endovascular removal of the clot by in situ fibrinolysis and, more recently, fragmentation and aspiration. There are published results of several studies evaluating the use of mechanical thrombectomy/catheter-directed thrombolysis (MT/CDT) in acute DVT. The CaVenT trial, the CAVA trial, and the largest randomized study supporting this concept is the ATTRACT trial, published at the end of 2017. The ATTRACT trial showed no significant difference between pharmacomechanical catheter-directed thrombolysis and control groups in PTS occurrence. Subgroup analysis within the ATTRACT population indicated a notable decrease in PTS severity, leg pain, and swelling for patients with iliofemoral DVT. Currently, CDT and MT are recommended in the guidelines for use in practice for the management of patients with DVT.

Our hospital is a tertiary care center in the Moscow region that specializes in VTE management. More than1000 patients with DVT are referred to our hospital annually. The objective of our study was to analyze real-life data on the use of endovascular management for DVT extracted from our hospital's database.

### Indications for catheter-directed thrombolysis in the management of acute proximal deep venous thrombosis [^114YP7DZ]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2010). Low credibility.

Deep vein thromboses (DVTs) cause significant morbidity and mortality in the general population. Oral anticoagulation therapy may reduce thrombus propagation but does not cause clot lysis and therefore does not prevent postthrombotic syndrome (PTS). Catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) can be used to treat DVTs as an adjunct to medical therapy, but there is no consensus defining exact indications. Current evidence suggests that CDT can reduce clot burden and DVT recurrence and consequently prevents the formation of PTS compared with systemic anticoagulation. Appropriate indications include younger individuals with acute proximal thromboses, a long life expectancy, and relatively few comorbidities. Limb-threatening thromboses may also be treated with CDT, although the subsequent mortality remains high. A number of randomized controlled trials are currently under way comparing the longer-term outcomes of CDT compared with anticoagulation alone. Initial reports suggest that venous patency and valvular function are better maintained after CDT. The effectiveness of combined pharmacomechanical thrombectomy and the role of vena cava filters need to be investigated further before strong recommendations can be made. The reported short-term outcomes following catheter-based intervention for DVT are encouraging in selected patients. Further evidence is required to establish long-term benefits and cost-effectiveness.

### Endovascular treatment of lower limb acute DVT: current trends and future directions [^1166u1EE]. CVIR Endovascular (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute deep vein thrombosis (DVT) of the lower extremities is a prevalent vascular disorder characterized by the sudden formation of blood clots within the deep veins, often associated with significant morbidity and mortality if left untreated. Acute DVT refers to the presence of symptoms for less than 14 days or for which imaging studies indicate that thrombosis occurred within the previous 14 days. Prompt and effective management of acute DVT is imperative to prevent potential life-threatening complications, such as pulmonary embolism and the development of post-thrombotic syndrome. Historically, anticoagulation therapy has been the primary approach for the treatment of acute DVT, aiming to halt clot propagation and reduce the risk of embolization. However, advancements in endovascular techniques have introduced new possibilities for the rapid and targeted treatment of acute DVT.

European Society for Vascular Surgery (ESVS) and the American Society of Interventional Radiology (SIR), emphasizing a comprehensive approach to management. Current recommendations advocate for a combination of anticoagulation therapy, thrombolysis, and mechanical thrombectomy depending on the severity and location of the thrombus. Anticoagulation with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) or direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) remains the cornerstone of initial therapy to prevent clot extension and embolization. In cases of extensive or severe DVT, especially involving the iliofemoral veins, endovascular techniques such as catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) or percutaneous mechanical thrombectomy (PMT) may be considered to expedite thrombus resolution and reduce long-term complications such as post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) and recurrent thrombosis (ESVS, SIR).

### The management and referral of iliofemoral deep venous thrombosis in north west london [^111Z3jiq]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Post-thrombotic syndrome is a common complication of iliofemoral deep venous thrombosis (IFDVT). Existing evidence and National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines suggest that this can be reduced by prompt thrombolytic therapy or thrombectomy. We aimed to evaluate the characteristics of IFDVT patients and to identify whether patients are being offered the recommended treatment pathway.

Methods

A multicenter cross-sectional study was conducted across eight hospital sites in the North West London region, of which two were hub hospitals in their local vascular service networks. Patients with proximal DVT were identified using International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision coding during a 1-year period. Data on demographics, diagnostic methods used, interventions, and referrals were extracted from electronic and paper medical records.

Results

During the study period, 132 patients with IFDVT were identified (mean age, 59.4 years; 55% female); 75% of these patients had an IFDVT. In this cohort, the biggest predisposing factors were previous DVT (n = 35), malignant disease (n = 35), and immobility (n = 20). In total, 104 patients were administered anticoagulation, and 88 of these patients received anticoagulation within 24 hours. The cases of 45 patients were either discussed with or promptly referred to a vascular service, after which 20 patients were treated solely with anticoagulation, whereas 20 patients received thrombolysis of varying methods.

Conclusions

A significant proportion (56%) of symptomatic IFDVT patients are not being appropriately referred to or discussed with vascular services. Of these, 43% would have been eligible for consideration of early thrombus removal. Adherence to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines could be improved by increasing awareness among emergency department colleagues.

### Early thrombus removal strategies for acute deep venous thrombosis: clinical practice guidelines of the Society for Vascular Surgery and the American Venous Forum [^113HmUSt]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2012). Medium credibility.

Society for Vascular Surgery and American Venous Forum — guideline development and GRADE definitions are described as follows: "The Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS) and American Venous Forum (AVF) formed a committee of experts in venous disease to develop evidence-based clinical practice guidelines regarding strategies of early thrombus removal for acute DVT", and "The committee commissioned the conduct of a systematic review and meta-analysis of the relevant literature to inform their recommendations", supplemented "as for pharmacomechanical thrombolysis and inferior vena cava (IVC) filtration" by "less rigorous data, including those from pooled analyses and case series". Recommendations "are made according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach", with "two components to any treatment recommendation: the first is a designation of the strength of the recommendation (strong: 1; or weak: 2)"; and "the second is an evaluation of the level of evidence (A to C) based on the confidence that the estimated of effect is correct". In this framework, "Grade 1 recommendations are those in which the benefits of an intervention clearly outweigh its risk and burdens. All well-informed patients would choose such a treatment, and the physician can securely recommend it without a detailed knowledge of the underlying data", whereas "Grade 2 recommendations are weaker and reflect therapies where the benefits and risks are uncertain or are more closely balanced. For such interventions, patients may choose different options based on their underlying values".

### Advances in operative thrombectomy for lower extremity venous thrombosis [^116YVmYp]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Lower extremity deep venous thrombosis is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. The mainstay of therapy is medical. However, anticoagulation does not remove the thrombus and restore venous patency. In select patients, early thrombus removal and anticoagulation can restore venous patency, preserve venous valve function, and may reduce the incidence of postthrombotic syndrome. Catheter-directed therapies are minimally invasive with low complication rates. However, in patients with a contraindication to thrombolytic agents who can receive anticoagulation, open thrombectomy should be considered if indications for thrombus removal are met and patients are good operative risks.

Iliofemoral venous thrombosis — long-term outcomes and postthrombotic burden are substantial. Venous claudication has been reported in as many as 43.6% of patients a median of 5 years after iliofemoral DVT. Involvement of the iliofemoral venous segment is associated with at least as great a mean change in Villalta score (+2.23; 95% confidence interval, 1.29–3.16) as a previous ipsilateral DVT (+1.78; 95% CI, 0.69–2.87). Patients with extensive iliofemoral venous thrombosis have a greater than twofold increased risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism compared with those with femoropopliteal thrombosis.

### A systematic review and meta-analysis of the efficacy and safety of lytic and non-lytic early thrombus removal technologies for iliofemoral deep vein thrombosis [^1178ztfk]. Annals of Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

This systematic review and meta-analysis compared the effectiveness and safety of lytic and non-lytic early thrombus removal strategies in addition to anticoagulation versus anticoagulation alone.

Summary Background Data

Early thrombus removal strategies have been developed to prevent post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) following acute iliofemoral deep vein thrombosis (DVT).

Methods

This review followed PRISMA guidelines using a registered protocol (CRD42023437158). The MEDLINE and Embase databases, as well as trial registries, were searched without limitations. Head-to-head or single-armed trials or studies that reported the rate of PTS in patients with iliofemoral DVT (symptomatic for < 28 d) and early thrombus removal were included. The rates of PTS, moderate-severe PTS, major bleeding, risk-benefit ratio, DVT recurrence and mortality were pooled in meta-analysis with fixed or random effects.

Results

Across all study designs (20 studies), the rate of PTS was 24.5% (95% CI 19.5.1–30.3%) for lytic therapies, 18.8% (1 study) for non-lytic therapy and 40.4% (95% CI 35.3–45.7) for anticoagulation alone. The number needed to treat was 6 for PTS and 15 for moderate-severe PTS. In randomised trials, the odds of major bleeding with lytic therapies was 4.9 (95% CI 1.3–19.1) compared to anticoagulation; the number needed to harm was 33. There was no major bleeding for mechanical thrombectomy.

Conclusions

Early thrombus removal reduces PTS and moderate-severe PTS, whilst increasing non-fatal major bleeding. Mechanical thrombectomy removes major bleeding risk but efficacy evidence is limited to one observational study.

### Early thrombus removal strategies for acute deep venous thrombosis: clinical practice guidelines of the Society for Vascular Surgery and the American Venous Forum [^115b45Md]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2012). Medium credibility.

Early thrombus removal strategies — techniques: We suggest percutaneous catheter-based techniques (pharmacologic or pharmacomechanical) as first-line therapy for early thrombus removal in patients meeting the criteria in 1.1. We suggest a strategy of pharmacomechanical thrombolysis be considered over catheter-directed pharmacologic thrombolysis alone if expertise and resources are available. We suggest open surgical venous thrombectomy in selected patients who are not candidates for anticoagulation but in whom thrombolytic therapy is contraindicated.

### PRACTICE GUIDELINES chronic deep venous obstruction [^116BU6jK]. AVLS (2024). High credibility.

Post-thrombotic syndrome and recurrent thrombosis risk in femoroiliocaval veins (FICV): The Post-Thrombotic Syndrome (PTS) is the long-term sequela of unresolved deep venous thrombosis of the abdominal, pelvic, or leg veins resulting in chronic pain, swelling, and skin changes occurring in approximately 20–50% of patients treated with anticoagulation, and residual venous obstruction from incomplete recanalization after deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the FICV places the patient at a much higher risk of recurrent DVT.

### Mechanical thrombectomy for the treatment of lower extremity deep vein thrombosis [^111nAHeV]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2003). Low credibility.

Deep venous thrombosis (DVT) has potentially debilitating long-term sequelae if left untreated. Conventional treatment (systemic anticoagulation with heparin followed by coumadin or low molecular weight heparin) often does not adequately relieves clot burden or symptoms, and patients may be left with post-thrombotic syndrome. Although the advent of catheter-directed thrombolysis has markedly improved the treatment of DVT and long-term outcomes of patients treated for DVT, it remains only partially effective on subacute or chronic clot. Mechanical thrombolysis may work synergistically with catheter-directed thrombolysis to decrease clot burden, treatment time, and complication rates, thereby improving outcomes.

### Post-thrombotic syndrome: prevalence, prognostication and need for progress [^113Zfib9]. British Journal of Haematology (2009). Low credibility.

Despite considerable progress in the diagnosis and treatment of deep-vein thrombosis (DVT) of the lower extremities, one of every 2–3 patients will develop within 2 years post-thrombotic sequelae, which are severe in approximately 10% of cases and produce considerable socio-economic consequences. Among factors potentially related to the development of the post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) are older age, obesity, a history of previous ipsilateral DVT, iliac-femoral location of the current thrombosis, failure to promptly recover from the acute symptoms and insufficient quality of oral anticoagulant therapy. Based on recent findings, the lack of vein recanalization within the first 6 months after DVT appears to be an important predictor of PTS, while the role of venous reflux is controversial. According to the results of recent clinical studies, the prompt administration of adequate compression elastic stockings in patients with symptomatic DVT has the potential to halve the frequency of PTS, and when carefully supervised and instructed to wear proper elastic stockings, more than 50% of patients have the potential to either remain stable or improve during long-term follow-up. Nevertheless, due to limitations in current therapies, the management of PTS is demanding and often frustrating. Further research is required to optimize the prevention and management of this common and burdensome complication of DVT.

### The current role of operative venous thrombectomy in deep vein thrombosis [^115yK7Ld]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Patients with acute iliofemoral deep vein thrombosis suffer the most severe post-thrombotic sequelae. The pathophysiology of the post-thrombotic syndrome is ambulatory venous hypertension, and patients with valve dysfunction and luminal obstruction have the highest ambulatory venous pressures. Treatment designed to reduce or eliminate the post-thrombotic syndrome must necessarily remove thrombus to eliminate obstruction. The technique of contemporary venous thrombectomy follows basic vascular surgical principles and offers patients the opportunity for complete or near complete thrombus extraction. The techniques described herein represent the authors' approach to patients with few alternatives to clear their venous system.

### Epidemiology of acute deep vein thrombosis [^116VnuDj]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2004). Low credibility.

Although the factors leading to venous thrombosis have been known for over a century, Virchow's initial model of thrombosis has been extensively refined. Activated coagulation is now recognized to be of primary importance in venous thrombogenesis; the concept of venous injury has been expanded to include molecular changes in the endothelium; and stasis has been redefined as a largely permissive factor. Furthermore, it is now clear that venous thrombi undergo a dynamic evolution beginning early after their formation. The natural history of acute deep venous thrombosis (DVT) is a balance between recurrent thrombotic events and processes that restore the venous lumen, both of which have important implications for the development of complications. Although pulmonary embolism (PE) is clearly the most life threatening complication of acute DVT, the long term socio-economic consequences of the post thrombotic syndrome (PTS) have perhaps been underemphasized in clinical trials. The development of post-thrombotic manifestations is related to both residual venous obstruction and valvular incompetence. Recognition of the factors contributing to a poor outcome, including recurrent thrombotic events, the rate of recanalization, the global extent of venous reflux, and the anatomic distribution of reflux and obstruction is important, as there may be therapeutic alternatives to alter the natural history of acute DVT. The treatment alternatives will continue to expand with the introduction of new therapeutic drugs, for both systemic and catheter-directed therapy, and mechanical thrombectomy devices. The primary care physician is challenged with the task of correctly evaluating deep vein thrombosis and providing his patient with access to the most clinically appropriate, and cost-effective, diagnostic and management options available. This article will review the epidemiology of DVT, its risk factors and major complications.

### Peripheral thrombus extension is associated with increased risk of recurrent deep venous thrombosis in patients undergoing percutaneous thrombectomy for iliofemoral deep venous thrombosis [^114ZBXgS]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Article Highlights

- **Type of Research**: Single-center retrospective cohort study
- **Key Findings**: This was a retrospective study of 222 patients who underwent percutaneous thrombectomy for iliofemoral deep venous thrombosis (DVT) at a single academic institution. Patients with more peripheral thrombus extension, ie, involving the popliteal and tibial veins, were more likely to experience acute DVT recurrence after thrombectomy.
- **Take Home Message**: More extensive peripheral thrombus burden was associated with higher rates of follow-up DVT recurrence in patients undergoing thrombectomy for iliofemoral DVT. These findings suggest that such patients may require closer follow-up and more aggressive anticoagulation therapy postoperatively.

The estimated incidence of lower extremity deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in the United States population is 0.1%, and it can lead to significant early and serious late morbidity. Long-term complications of DVT include post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS). PTS is a long-term condition defined by symptoms including leg heaviness, pain, edema, and itching, which greatly impact the quality of life for affected patients. Currently, there is no effective treatment for established PTS; thus, preventing its onset after DVT is crucial. Patients with iliofemoral DVT have been reported to have the highest risk for post-thrombotic morbidity, with a prevalence of PTS of 50% at 2 years.

Percutaneous thrombectomy is often used to treat iliofemoral DVT because it quickly removes the thrombus and improves clinical symptoms. This rapid removal of thrombus attempts to mitigate the risk of developing PTS. It has been reported that treating DVT with endovascular interventional methods results in lower Villalta scores postoperatively and significantly decreases the severity of PTS. According to the Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders guidelines, percutaneous catheter-based techniques are used as first-line therapy for rapid thrombus removal in patients with good functional capacity and a first episode of iliofemoral DVT < 14 days in duration. Mechanical and pharmacochemical thrombectomy have been found to be safe and effective in removing thrombus for patients with iliofemoral DVT.

Although DVT recurrence has been reported in patients undergoing thrombectomy, there is a paucity of literature evaluating risk factors, including patient-specific and operative techniques, that may lead to thrombus recurrence. The relationship between the extent of DVT and outcomes after thrombectomy has yet to be explored. This study specifically aimed to investigate thrombus burden and extent of peripheral extension on rates of post-thrombectomy DVT recurrence in patients with iliofemoral DVT.

### Management guidelines from the American Society of Hematology… [^114BZgG8]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- In-hospital and home treatment of PE provide similar outcomes, although home treatment of DVT produces better outcomes.
- After primary DOAC treatment for three to six months, decisions for indefinite anticoagulation depend on risk factors associated with initial VTE.
- When VTE is unprovoked or associated with chronic factors, indefinite anticoagulation reduces recurrent VTE with a slightly increased risk of major bleeding. Initial Management of VTE TREATMENT SETTING Treating VTE at home often produces better outcomes than treating in the hospital. In patients with uncomplicated DVT, treating at home reduces the likelihood of PE development. The risk of a subsequent DVT is also less. Mortality and bleeding rates with DVT are similar between treatment settings. For patients with clinically stable PE, home treatment produces outcomes similar to those with hospital treatment.

THROMBOLYSIS In the absence of threat to the limb or high risk of severe postthrombotic syndrome, thrombolytic therapy is not recommended for DVT. Up to one-half of patients with proximal DVT develop postthrombotic syndrome, although only 10% will experience severe symptoms. Thrombolysis reduces postthrombotic syndrome but increases major bleeding, with similar mortality and subsequent VTE risks. Patients with unprovoked VTE do not need follow-up studies such as d-dimer testing or ultrasonography to detect residual thrombosis to consider extending treatment. Limited study suggests that using these methods results in increased major bleeding with only slight reductions in future VTE. After VTE that is unprovoked or provoked by a chronic factor, indefinite anticoagulation should be considered.

For unprovoked VTE, indefinite anticoagulation with a DOAC reduces recurrent PE and DVT, although with an increase in major bleeding.

### Updated American College of Chest Physicians guideline… [^1167MBZy]. AAFP (2022). Medium credibility.

The latest update to the American College of Chest Physicians guideline regarding antithrombotic therapy for VTE adds four new recommendations and updates eight others. The authors identified an initiation phase when anticoagulants are first given, a treatment phase of three months, and an extended phase for selected patients beyond three months. For patients with acute isolated distal DVT, the guidelines recommend two weeks of serial imaging, with anticoagulation only if the DVT extends or the patient has severe symptoms or risk factors for extension. For patients with subsegmental PE, no proximal DVT in the legs, and who are at low risk for recurrent VTE, clinical observation without anticoagulation is recommended. Outpatient therapy for PE is recommended if patients are clinically stable; there is no recent bleeding, thrombocytopenia, or severe liver or kidney disease; and they feel well enough to be treated at home and are likely to be adherent.

For patients with asymptomatic PE incidentally diagnosed during computed tomography of the chest, anticoagulation is recommended because studies have shown a similar prognosis to symptomatic PE. For patients with cancer, apixaban, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban are recommended over low-molecular-weight heparin for treatment of VTE. The authors make a weak recommendation for 45 days of fondaparinux, 2. 5 mg daily, or rivaroxaban, 10 mg daily, for patients with superficial venous thrombosis of the lower leg. Extended-phase low-dose anticoagulation with apixaban, 2. 5 mg twice daily, or rivaroxaban, 10 mg once daily, is recommended for all patients with unprovoked VTE. This has only been studied for two to four years, so extending anticoagulation beyond that is of uncertain benefit. Aspirin is recommended when patients discontinue extended-phase anticoagulation.

For patients with PE, thrombolytics are recommended only for patients with hypotension initially or who deteriorate clinically, assuming they do not have high bleeding risk. For those with a high bleeding risk or for those whom thrombolysis was ineffective, catheter-assisted thrombus removal is recommended. Inferior vena cava filters are recommended only for patients with DVT who have a contraindication to anticoagulation. For patients with cerebral vein or venous sinus thrombosis, anticoagulation is recommended. Compression stockings are not recommended for patients with acute DVT.

### 2016 ACCP guideline on antithrombotic therapy for VTE… [^112ZcHu9]. JAMA Network (2017). Excellent credibility.

The estimated annual incidence of VTE, defined as DVT of the leg or PE, ranges from 104 to 183 per 100 000 person-years. 1 Compared with those without VTE, the 30-year mortality risk is increased for survivors of an episode of VTE and for survivors of an episode of. PE. 2 In 2012, the ACCP released the ninth-edition guidelines for antithrombotic therapy and prevention of thrombosis. 3 Since the publication of that guideline, there has been improved understanding of the diagnosis and prognosis of VTE. The addition of non–vitamin K oral anticoagulants has altered the landscape of treatment options. This update addresses the role for NOACs and provides new recommendations for management of subsegmental PE and treatment of cancer-associated VTE. Jain A, Cifu AS.
