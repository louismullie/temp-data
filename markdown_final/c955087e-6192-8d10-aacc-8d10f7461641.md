## Question

What labs do you get to check for diabetes type one?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which laboratory tests are used to check for type 1 diabetes. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and whether we are diagnosing overt diabetes, classifying diabetes type, or screening for presymptomatic disease. Then, I should verify the core diagnostic tests for hyperglycemia and their limitations. Next, I will examine islet autoantibodies for classification and staging. After that, I need to consider C-peptide for assessing insulin deficiency and timing of testing. I should also review when and how to use oral glucose tolerance testing, including alternatives. Finally, I will integrate special populations, assay quality, and a practical algorithm, while double-checking areas where older guidance conflicts with newer standards and correcting them explicitly.

> Let me first confirm the clinical contexts because the lab panel differs by scenario: diagnosing overt diabetes, classifying diabetes type in someone already diagnosed, screening for presymptomatic type 1 diabetes in high-risk individuals, and monitoring disease progression in those with early-stage disease. I need to ensure I tailor the tests to each context rather than mixing them indiscriminately [^6a64d0e6] [^805a3c31] [^04207b46].

> Next, I should review the core diagnostic tests for hyperglycemia that establish diabetes regardless of type. Wait, let me verify the ADA-endorsed options: fasting plasma glucose, 2-hour plasma glucose during a 75-g OGTT, random plasma glucose with classic symptoms, or A1C using a certified method, with confirmatory testing unless unequivocal hyperglycemia is present. I should also remember that A1C has lower sensitivity early in type 1 diabetes and can be normal at diagnosis in a substantial fraction, so a normal A1C does not exclude type 1 diabetes when clinical suspicion is high [^6a64d0e6] [^32e06943] [^77d28767].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of islet autoantibodies because they are central to classification and staging. The key antibodies are GADA, IA-2A, and ZnT8A, with insulin autoantibodies useful when measured before insulin exposure. IAA loses specificity once exogenous insulin is started, so timing matters. Multiple confirmed autoantibodies indicate high risk of progression, and standardized assays with participation in quality programs are essential to avoid false positives and negatives. I need to ensure I emphasize that a negative panel does not fully exclude type 1 diabetes, especially in adults, where 5–10% can be antibody negative at onset [^14151e2a] [^254c4d6d] [^a657e39c].

> I will now examine C-peptide, since it helps distinguish insulin deficiency from preserved endogenous insulin. Let me think about timing: within 3 years of diagnosis, C-peptide may still be substantial even in type 1 diabetes due to residual beta-cell function, so interpretation is tricky. Beyond 3 years, nonfasting C-peptide less than about 0.2 nmol/L supports severe insulin deficiency consistent with type 1 diabetes, whereas values above about 0.6 nmol/L suggest preserved endogenous insulin and argue against type 1 diabetes. I should double-check that I note exceptions like hypoglycemia or recent hyperglycemic crises that can transiently suppress C-peptide and confound interpretation [^602c24e8] [^0e2a001e] [^7f649bb4].

> Next, I should review oral glucose tolerance testing, because it remains the gold standard for detecting dysglycemia in presymptomatic type 1 diabetes. Wait, I initially thought CGM could replace OGTT for staging, but I need to correct that: CGM is promising for screening and risk stratification but is not yet a replacement for blood-based staging. OGTT with fasting and 2-hour glucose, and in some protocols 30–90 minute values, helps identify stage 2 disease and guide eligibility for disease-modifying therapy and surveillance frequency [^f4e993b8] [^989dcb64] [^92f5c4bc].

> Let me consider special populations and contexts. In children and adolescents, I should prioritize autoantibodies at diagnosis and remember the high DKA risk, which justifies early insulin initiation when type 1 diabetes is suspected. In adults with atypical features or rapid progression, I should obtain autoantibodies and consider C-peptide if uncertainty persists. For presymptomatic screening, I need to ensure I target high-risk groups such as first-degree relatives or those with high genetic risk, and if multiple autoantibodies are found, arrange surveillance with periodic A1C and OGTT and consider referral for trials or approved delay therapy [^254c4d6d] [^5517ae30] [^04207b46].

> I should confirm assay quality and logistics because misclassification is common with nonstandardized tests. Autoantibody assays should meet performance standards and participate in programs like IASP, and results should be confirmed with repeat testing when positive. Point-of-care A1C is not acceptable for diagnosis unless the device is FDA-cleared for diagnostic use and operated in a CLIA-certified lab, so I need to ensure I send A1C to a certified laboratory when used diagnostically [^254c4d6d] [^9f05259f] [^b00d1a27].

> But wait, what if the presentation is classic for type 1 diabetes with DKA or marked hyperglycemia and symptoms? In that scenario, I should not delay insulin while waiting for autoantibodies or C-peptide. I can obtain those tests concurrently and use them to refine classification later, recognizing that early C-peptide may be misleadingly preserved and that antibody titers can wane over time, so a negative panel does not overturn a clear clinical picture [^14151e2a] [^602c24e8].

> Let me synthesize a practical approach. For suspected overt diabetes, I should obtain plasma glucose and/or A1C to confirm diabetes, then add GADA, IA-2A, and ZnT8A to classify as type 1 versus type 2, and consider C-peptide if classification remains uncertain or to guide long-term therapy. For presymptomatic screening in high-risk individuals, I should obtain a standardized autoantibody panel and, if positive, proceed with A1C and OGTT to stage disease and initiate surveillance. For monitoring progression, I should repeat A1C about every 6 months and OGTT annually, adjusting frequency to age, antibody number and type, and glycemic metrics [^6a64d0e6] [^14151e2a] [^04207b46].

> Finally, I need to ensure I address common pitfalls. Misclassification of adult-onset type 1 diabetes as type 2 diabetes is frequent, so I should maintain a low threshold to test autoantibodies in adults under about 40–45 years or those with atypical features. I should also remember that monogenic diabetes remains a consideration in antibody-negative, young-onset cases with preserved C-peptide, prompting genetic testing when suspicion is high. And I should counsel that early detection of presymptomatic type 1 diabetes enables education, surveillance, and potential delay of clinical disease with approved therapy, which is why standardized screening pathways are increasingly emphasized [^2ae1d77a] [^ef7a3a3c] [^2156b45d].

To check for type 1 diabetes, order **fasting plasma glucose** or a **random plasma glucose** with symptoms, and confirm with **A1C** if needed [^6a64d0e6]. If classification is uncertain, add **islet autoantibodies** (GADA, IA-2A, ZnT8A) [^14151e2a] and consider **C-peptide** to assess insulin deficiency [^602c24e8]. Use **OGTT** when early dysglycemia is suspected or to stage presymptomatic disease [^f4e993b8] [^989dcb64]. Routine genetic testing is not recommended for diagnosis [^377d8402].

---

## Initial diagnostic tests

### Plasma glucose tests

- **Fasting plasma glucose (FPG)**: ≥ 126 mg/dL (7.0 mmol/L) on two occasions confirms diabetes [^6a64d0e6].
- **Random plasma glucose**: ≥ 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) with classic symptoms (polyuria, polydipsia, weight loss) supports diabetes [^6a64d0e6].
- **Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT)**: 2-hour plasma glucose ≥ 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) after a 75-g glucose load confirms diabetes [^6a64d0e6].

---

### Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c)

HbA1c **≥ 6.5% (48 mmol/mol)** using a certified, NGSP-aligned method confirms diabetes [^6a64d0e6]; however, it has lower sensitivity in T1D and may be normal at onset, so a normal A1C does not exclude T1D when clinical suspicion is high [^32e06943].

---

## Autoantibody tests for classification

Islet autoantibodies distinguish T1D from other diabetes types; **multiple autoantibodies** indicate autoimmune T1D [^7fd4116c].

| **Autoantibody** | **Frequency in t1d** | **Clinical significance** |
|-|-|-|
| GADA (glutamic acid decarboxylase) | 70–80% | - Most sensitive single marker <br/> - Persists longer [^a657e39c] |
| IA-2A (insulinoma-associated antigen 2) | 60–70% | Common in childhood-onset T1D [^a657e39c] |
| ZnT8A (zinc transporter 8) | 60–70% | Useful when GADA/IA-2A are negative [^notfound] |
| IAA (insulin autoantibodies) | 50–70% (mainly in children) | Less specific after insulin exposure [^a657e39c] |

---

Testing for **multiple autoantibodies** improves sensitivity and specificity; a single autoantibody has limited predictive value and may be transient [^a657e39c].

---

## C-peptide test for insulin deficiency

C-peptide reflects endogenous insulin production and helps distinguish T1D (absolute insulin deficiency) from T2D (relative deficiency). Low C-peptide (** < 0.2 nmol/L**) in a nonfasting state suggests severe insulin deficiency and supports T1D, whereas higher levels indicate preserved beta-cell function and favor T2D or other types [^0e2a001e]. Testing is most informative **after 3 years** of disease, as early C-peptide may be misleading due to residual function [^602c24e8].

---

## Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) for early dysglycemia

OGTT detects early dysglycemia in presymptomatic T1D and is the **gold standard** for staging [^f4e993b8]. Impaired fasting glucose (100–125 mg/dL) or impaired glucose tolerance (140–199 mg/dL at 2 hours) indicates stage 2 T1D and a high risk of progression [^989dcb64].

---

## Genetic testing (not routine)

Genetic testing (e.g. HLA typing) is **not recommended for routine diagnosis** but may be considered in research or when monogenic diabetes is suspected [^377d8402] [^ef7a3a3c].

---

## Summary of recommended laboratory tests

| **Test** | **Purpose** | **Indication** |
|-|-|-|
| Fasting plasma glucose | Diagnose diabetes | Initial test |
| Random plasma glucose | Diagnose diabetes | Symptomatic patients |
| HbA1c | Diagnose/monitor diabetes | Confirm diagnosis; monitor control |
| GADA, IA-2A, ZnT8A | Classify diabetes | Uncertain type; adult-onset |
| C-peptide | Assess insulin deficiency | Uncertain type; > 3 years duration |
| OGTT | Detect early dysglycemia | Presymptomatic staging |

---

## Clinical considerations

- **Age of onset**: T1D can occur at any age; adult-onset T1D is often misclassified as T2D [^2ae1d77a].
- **Body mass index (BMI)**: Overweight/obesity does not exclude T1D [^7f649bb4].
- **Family history**: Increases risk but is present in only ~10% of T1D cases [^254c4d6d].

---

## Conclusion

A comprehensive approach includes plasma glucose or A1C to diagnose diabetes, **autoantibodies** to confirm autoimmune T1D, and **C-peptide** to assess insulin deficiency. OGTT is used for early dysglycemia or staging, and genetic testing is reserved for select cases.

Background

Numerous laboratory tests are used in the diagnosis and management of diabetes mellitus. The quality of the scientific evidence supporting the use of these assays varies substantially.

Approach

An expert committee compiled evidence-based recommendations for laboratory analysis in screening, diagnosis, or monitoring of diabetes. The overall quality of the evidence and the strength of the recommendations were evaluated. The draft consensus recommendations were evaluated by invited reviewers and presented for public comment. Suggestions were incorporated as deemed appropriate by the authors (see Acknowledgments). The guidelines were reviewed by the Evidence Based Laboratory Medicine Committee and the Board of Directors of the American Association for Clinical Chemistry and by the Professional Practice Committee of the American Diabetes Association.

Content

Diabetes can be diagnosed by demonstrating increased concentrations of glucose in venous plasma or increased hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) in the blood. Glycemic control is monitored by the people with diabetes measuring their own blood glucose with meters and/or with continuous interstitial glucose monitoring (CGM) devices and also by laboratory analysis of HbA1c. The potential roles of noninvasive glucose monitoring, genetic testing, and measurement of ketones, autoantibodies, urine albumin, insulin, proinsulin, and C-peptide are addressed.

Summary

The guidelines provide specific recommendations based on published data or derived from expert consensus. Several analytes are found to have minimal clinical value at the present time, and measurement of them is not recommended.

### International expert committee report on the role of the A1c assay in the diagnosis of diabetes [^09f9e67b]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

What are the practical issues related to A1C testing?

A1C tests to diagnose diabetes should be performed using clinical laboratory equipment. Point-of-care instruments have not yet been shown to be sufficiently accurate or precise for diagnosing diabetes. Although this International Expert Committee has concluded that the attributes of the A1C assay with regard to diagnosing diabetes and detecting individuals at high risk support its use over the FPG or 2HPG tests, the superiority of A1C testing does not invalidate the diagnostic criteria based on glucose testing. In circumstances when A1C testing cannot be performed, the diagnostic glucose tests are acceptable alternatives.

Whichever of the three different tests now available to diagnose diabetes (A1C, FPG, and 2HPG) is used, both initial and confirmatory testing should be performed with the same test. As the three tests are not completely concordant, using different tests could easily lead to confusion. The only exception to the need to confirm the diagnosis of diabetes with the same test would be the presence of clinical symptoms characteristic of diabetes and glucose levels > 200 mg/dl (> 11.1 mmol/l). Confirmatory testing is also not required to establish risk status in individuals identified as in the highest-risk group for diabetes (A1C of 6.0 to < 6.5%).

Most cases of type 1 diabetes, particularly in children and adolescents, are diagnosed by the classical symptoms of polyuria, polydipsia, polyphagia, unexplained weight loss, and a casual glucose > 200 mg/dl. If diabetes is suspected in the absence of those conditions, A1C testing is warranted.

### Guidelines and recommendations for laboratory analysis in the diagnosis and management of diabetes mellitus [^dab88435]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Multiple laboratory tests are used to diagnose and manage patients with diabetes mellitus. The quality of the scientific evidence supporting the use of these tests varies substantially.

Approach

An expert committee compiled evidence-based recommendations for the use of laboratory testing for patients with diabetes. A new system was developed to grade the overall quality of the evidence and the strength of the recommendations. Draft guidelines were posted on the Internet and presented at the 2007 Arnold O. Beckman Conference. The document was modified in response to oral and written comments, and a revised draft was posted in 2010 and again modified in response to written comments. The National Academy of Clinical Biochemistry and the Evidence-Based Laboratory Medicine Committee of the American Association for Clinical Chemistry jointly reviewed the guidelines, which were accepted after revisions by the Professional Practice Committee and subsequently approved by the Executive Committee of the American Diabetes Association.

Content

In addition to long-standing criteria based on measurement of plasma glucose, diabetes can be diagnosed by demonstrating increased blood hemoglobin A(1c) (HbA(1c)) concentrations. Monitoring of glycemic control is performed by self-monitoring of plasma or blood glucose with meters and by laboratory analysis of HbA(1c). The potential roles of noninvasive glucose monitoring, genetic testing, and measurement of autoantibodies, urine albumin, insulin, proinsulin, C-peptide, and other analytes are addressed.

Summary

The guidelines provide specific recommendations that are based on published data or derived from expert consensus. Several analytes have minimal clinical value at present, and their measurement is not recommended.

A critical point is that early‐stage type 1 diabetes, particularly Stage 1, is diagnosed entirely based on laboratory tests. This makes the establishment of clear diagnostic criteria essential. Accurate criteria are vital to avoid overdiagnosis (false positives: individuals who do not develop clinical type 1 diabetes) and underdiagnosis (false negatives: individuals who develop clinical type 1 diabetes without an early‐stage diagnosis). In the strictest sense, true early‐stage type 1 diabetes should reliably progress to clinical type 1 diabetes, with diagnostic tests minimizing both false positives and false negatives.

### Type 1 diabetes risk factors, risk prediction and presymptomatic detection: evidence and guidance for screening [^02fd6f1e]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Type 1 diabetes is recognized as a chronic disease with a presymptomatic phase that does not require insulin therapy and a clinical phase where insulin treatment becomes necessary. The presymptomatic phase is characterized by the presence of autoantibodies targeting pancreatic islet beta cell antigens (islet autoantibodies). This phase is further classified into three stages: Stage 1, defined by normoglycaemia; Stage 2, characterized by dysglycaemia; and Stage 3, marked by hyperglycaemia, which typically presents clinically and necessitates insulin therapy. The prospect of therapies to delay the onset of clinical disease and insulin treatment has been a driver of research into the presymptomatic phase since the discovery of islet autoantibodies. With the recent approval of teplizumab as a therapy to delay disease progression, attention has increasingly focused on diagnosing individuals with Stage 1 and Stage 2 type 1 diabetes. However, diagnosing an asymptomatic condition that affects fewer than 1 in 200 individuals poses significant challenges. As we enter this new era of diagnosis, it is crucial to refine diagnostic approaches to ensure accuracy and effectiveness. This review summarizes current evidence and guidance while emphasizing the need for continued research alongside broader application of screening. PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY: Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease that affects approximately 0.5% of individuals. In this publication, the authors provide a comprehensive overview of strategies for identifying individuals in the pre-symptomatic, early stages of the disease. Early-stage type 1 diabetes can be detected by the presence of autoantibodies against specific proteins in the blood, signaling an ongoing disease process before clinical symptoms appear. Genetic factors also contribute to the development of these autoantibodies and the disease itself. The paper explores how these markers are used for early identification, emphasizing optimal screening ages and the role of confirmation tests in preventing misdiagnosis. A key consideration in early diagnosis is that disease progression varies-some individuals develop clinical diabetes rapidly, while others may take many years. The authors discuss additional tests that can help predict how soon a diagnosed individual may require insulin treatment. Finally, the paper highlights ongoing challenges in optimizing screening for wider application and the complexities of integrating research-based screening into routine clinical practice.

C. Screening for type 1 diabetes

Generally, people with type 1 diabetes present with acute symptoms of diabetes and markedly elevated blood glucose levels, and most cases are diagnosed soon after the onset of hyperglycemia. However, evidence from type 1 prevention studies suggests that measurement of islet autoantibodies identifies individuals who are at risk for developing type 1 diabetes. Such testing may be appropriate in high-risk individuals, such as those with prior transient hyperglycemia or those who have relatives with type 1 diabetes, in the context of clinical research studies (see, for example). Widespread clinical testing of asymptomatic low-risk individuals cannot currently be recommended, as it would identify very few individuals in the general population who are at risk. Individuals who screen positive should be counseled about their risk of developing diabetes. Clinical studies are being conducted to test various methods of preventing type 1 diabetes, or reversing early type 1 diabetes, in those with evidence of autoimmunity.

### Testing methods used to predict disease progression in children with early-stage type 1 diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^f4e993b8]. Diabetic Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

General population screening programs that identify children and young people (CYP) with early‐stage type 1 diabetes are increasing worldwide. These identify individuals with two or more islet autoantibodies (IA) with normoglycaemia (stage 1), dysglycaemia (stage 2), or a blood glucose above the diagnostic threshold of ≥ 11.1 mmol/L (stage 3). An accompanying follow‐up pathway is needed to see the benefits of screening, including a reduction in the rate of hospitalisation and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) at diagnosis and to identify individuals eligible for preventative therapies.,

The oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) is the current gold standard method to stage and monitor disease progression. Other tests are available to assess beta‐cell function, directly or indirectly, but uncertainty remains about their predictive value. A recent international consensus recognised the need to offer less invasive testing, suggesting practical alternatives to support monitoring in clinical care. This study aims to synthesize the evidence on the value of tests to predict progression to stage 3 type 1 diabetes in children with ≥ 2 IA.

### Diagnosis and classification of diabetes: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^254c4d6d]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Type 1 diabetes risk — presentation, autoantibody progression, and confirmation are described as follows: People with type 1 diabetes often present with acute symptoms of diabetes and markedly elevated blood glucose levels, and 25–50% are diagnosed with life-threatening DKA; the majority, ~90%, of individuals who develop type 1 diabetes do not have a known relative with the disease. Of the 585 children who developed more than two autoantibodies, nearly 70% developed type 1 diabetes within 10 years and 84% within 15 years. Such screening, coupled with education about diabetes symptoms and close follow-up, has been shown to enable earlier diagnosis and to prevent DKA. In several cohort studies, up to 50% of children with only a single autoantibody revert to being islet autoantibody negative during follow-up; therefore, it is recommended that the first autoantibody-positive test be confirmed with a second test within 3 months, preferably in a laboratory that meets the performance standards set by the Islet Autoantibody Standardization Program (IASP). In a simulation using one such genetic risk score, the majority of those who would go on to develop type 1 diabetes, > 77%, could be identified within just 10% of the general population.

### Diagnosis and classification of diabetes: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^568cafd9]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Type 1 diabetes natural history and progression risk indicate that stage 1, defined by the presence of two or more autoantibodies and normoglycemia, carries a 5-year risk of developing symptomatic type 1 diabetes of ~44%. In stage 2, risk is ~60% by 2 years and ~75% within 5 years of developing a clinical diagnosis of type 1 diabetes. A consensus group provides expert recommendations on what should be monitored and how often these factors should be monitored in individuals with presymptomatic type 1 diabetes.

### Type 1 diabetes screening and diagnosis [^3def963c]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Those with concerning signs or symptoms should be evaluated for type 1 diabetes (T1D). Those with first-degree relatives with T1D or based on the presence of high-risk genes are at increased risk and benefit from screening. Universal screening should be considered in light of new potential therapies to delay disease progression. Although oral glucose tolerance test is the gold standard for T1D staging, there are multiple tools available when oral glucose tolerance test is not feasible. Risk score calculations increase the ability to predict disease progression. Testing should be repeated when symptoms of overt diabetes mellitus are not present.

### Screening and prevention of type 1 diabetes: where are we? [^f3f8645a]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

A diagnosis of type 1 diabetes (T1D) and the subsequent requirement for exogenous insulin treatment is associated with considerable acute and chronic morbidity and a substantial effect on patient quality of life. Importantly, a large body of work suggests that early identification of presymptomatic T1D can accurately predict clinical disease, and when paired with education and monitoring, can yield improved health outcomes. Furthermore, a growing cadre of effective disease-modifying therapies provides the potential to alter the natural history of early stages of T1D. In this mini review, we highlight prior work that has led to the current landscape of T1D screening and prevention, as well as challenges and next steps moving into the future of these rapidly evolving areas of patient care.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for diabetes mellitus type 1, more specifically with respect to indications for screening (T1DM), ADA 2025 guidelines recommend to obtain standardized islet autoantibody tests for classification of diabetes in adults having phenotypic risk factors overlapping with T1DM (such as younger age at diagnosis, unintentional weight loss, ketoacidosis, or short time to insulin treatment).

### Standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^2707176d]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for diabetes mellitus type 1, more specifically with respect to HbA1c and blood glucose, ADA 2025 guidelines recommend to evaluate for the possibility of a problem or interference with either test when there is consistent and substantial discordance between blood glucose values and A1C test results.

### Standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^bc33815b]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for diabetes mellitus type 1, more specifically with respect to indications for screening (T1DM), ADA 2025 guidelines recommend to recognize that having multiple confirmed islet autoantibodies is a risk factor for clinical diabetes. Consider testing for dysglycemia to further forecast near-term risk. Consider referring patients with identified multiple islet autoantibodies to a specialized center for further evaluation and/or consideration of a clinical trial or approved therapy to potentially delay development of clinical diabetes.

Combining laboratory tests with clinical features.

Measurement of beta‐cell autoantibodies and C‐peptide are valuable in distinguishing T1D from other forms of diabetes. However, neither is perfect and we strongly advise that these tests are used and interpreted within the context of time since diagnosis and clinical likelihood of T1D to minimise false positives and negatives (Figure 1).
Beta‐cell autoantibodies. Measurement of autoantibodies to beta‐cell antigens (GADA, IA2A and ZnT8A) is valuable at diagnosis(or no later than 3 years after diagnosis when measurement of C‐peptide level is more appropriate — see below) in adults who are likely to have T1D on clinical criteria or have rapid glycaemic progression following diagnosis of T2D. Patients with positive beta‐cell autoantibodies in this context are likely to have autoimmune T1D. Whilst negative beta‐cell autoantibodies do not exclude T1D (sensitivity with the three autoantibodies is approximately 90%), they should prompt consideration of T2D in older adults, and of MODY in those diagnosed in the age ≤ 35. The probability of MODY based on clinical features can be assessed using the MODY calculator (app/ModyCalculator). We do not recommend routine testing in the absence of clinical suspicion of T1D or deteriorating glucose control, as false positives are common. Islet cell antigen (ICA) antibody measurement is not recommended, as this test is difficult to standardize, has poor sensitivity and does not offer additional information above the combination of GADA, IA‐2A and ZnT8A. We recommend testing all three autoantibodies to minimise the possibility of false negatives. Where there are logistic difficulties, a sequential approach is acceptable with testing for GADA first, as this identifies 60%–80% of T1D patients. Where GADA is negative or borderline, additional testing is recommended for IA2A and ZnT8A as this clarifies diagnosis in a further 10%–20% of people.
C‐peptide. Beta‐cell autoantibody positivity declines with diabetes duration, and as time passes from diagnosis, the diagnosis of T1D and need for insulin therapy is best determined by the level of insulin deficiency rather than the presence of autoimmunity. Hence, C‐peptide is the preferred initial test in patients with long duration diabetes. Beyond 3 years after diagnosis, where there is uncertainty about the diabetes type, and a patient is insulin treated, measurement of serum C‐peptide levels is valuable to establish treatment requirements. We recommend that C‐peptide is assessed on a non‐fasting blood sample, ideally within 1–5 h of a carbohydrate containing meal. Glucose should be measured alongside C‐peptide. C‐peptide values are approximately 2.5 times higher post meal compared to fasting. If the glucose is < 8mmol/L and C‐peptide < 0.6 nmol consider repeating the test, as falsely low levels may result from inadequate stimulation. Very low levels (< 0.08 nmol/L) do not need to be repeated.C‐peptide should not be tested during a period of hypoglycaemia or within 2 weeks of a hyperglycaemic emergency, as levels may be temporarily suppressed. Absolute cut‐off values are hard to define. However, non‐fasting serum C‐peptide ≥ 0.6 nmol/L (or equivalent urine C‐peptide creatinine ratio (UCPCR)) more than 3 years after diagnosis is strongly suggestive of T2D and lack of requirement for insulin. In this situation, replacement of insulin with other agents should be consideredwith careful monitoring of glycaemic control. A non‐fasting serum C‐peptide level of ≤ 0.2 nmol/l in the absence of hypoglycaemia (at the time of testing) is suggestive of severe insulin deficiency and should be considered to be secondary to T1D in the absence of severe underlying pancreatic pathology. More than 3 years after diagnosis, serum values of > 0.2 nmol/L should prompt consideration of MODY in the presence of negative beta‐cell autoantibodies and age of diagnosis < 35 years.C‐peptide testing may assist management before 3 years; however, a high C‐peptide level at this time should be treated with considerable caution when differentiating between diabetes types as T1D patients may still produce substantial amounts of endogenous insulin shortly after diagnosis.

### Diagnosis and classification of diabetes: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^805a3c31]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Type 1 diabetes — presymptomatic screening and classification recommendations indicate that screening for presymptomatic type 1 diabetes may be done by the detection of autoantibodies to insulin, glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), islet antigen 2 (IA-2), or zinc transporter 8 (ZnT8); autoantibody-based screening for presymptomatic type 1 diabetes should be considered in relatives of people with a family history of type 1 diabetes or otherwise known elevated genetic risk; having multiple confirmed islet autoantibodies is a risk factor for clinical diabetes and, when multiple islet autoantibodies are identified, referral to a specialized center for further evaluation and/or consideration of a clinical trial or approved therapy to potentially delay development of clinical diabetes should be considered; and standardized islet autoantibody tests are recommended for classification of diabetes in adults who have phenotypic risk factors that overlap with those for type 1 diabetes (e.g., younger age at diagnosis, unintentional weight loss, ketoacidosis, or short time to insulin treatment).

FIGURE 1
Algorithm for diagnosing Type 1 diabetes in adults.

Despite advances in tools for clarifying aetiology, there may be yet unidentified forms of diabetes that can be very challenging to classify in a simple algorithm. However, outside of specific forms of sulphonylurea‐sensitive monogenic diabetes, glycaemic treatment requirements are largely driven by the degree of insulin deficiency, rather than underlying disease aetiology. Therefore, most patients can be pragmatically and safely managed based on their endogenous insulin production, that is, C‐peptide levels, even if disease aetiology remains unclear.

1. Type 1 diabetes.

Genetic markers are currently of limited clinical value in evaluating and managing patients with diabetes; however, mutational analysis is rapidly emerging for classifying diabetes in the neonate and in young patients with a dominant family history of diabetes, often referred to as "maturity-onset diabetes of the young" (MODY). Type 1 or autoimmune diabetes is strongly associated with HLA-DR (major histocompatibility complex, class II, DR) and HLA-DQ (major histocompatibility complex, class II, DQ) genes. HLA-DQA1 and HLA-DQB1 genotyping can be useful to indicate the absolute risk of diabetes. The HLA DQA1 *0301– DQB1 *0302 and DQA1 *0501– DQB1 *0201 haplotypes, alone or in combination, may account for up to 90% of children and young adults with type 1 diabetes. These two haplotypes may be present in 30%–40% of a Caucasian population, and HLA is therefore necessary but not sufficient for disease. The HLA-DQ and HLA-DR genetic factors are by far the most important determinants of type 1 diabetes risk. HLA typing may be used in combination with islet autoantibody analyses to exclude type 1 diabetes in assisting in the diagnosis of genetic forms of diabetes.

As indicated below, HLA-DR/DQ typing can be useful to indicate a modified risk of type 1 diabetes in persons positive for islet cell autoantibodies, because protective alleles do not prevent the appearance of islet cell autoantibodies (most often as single autoantibodies) but may delay the onset of clinical diabetes. Typing of the class II major histocompatibility antigens or HLA-DRB1, -DQA1, and -DQB1 is not diagnostic for type 1 diabetes. Some haplotypes induce susceptibility, however, whereas others provide significant delay or even protection. Thus, HLA-DR/DQ typing can be used only to increase or decrease the probability of type 1 diabetes presentation and cannot be recommended for routine clinical diagnosis or classification.

The precision in the genetic characterization of type 1 diabetes may be extended by typing for polymorphisms in several genetic factors identified in genome-wide association studies. Non-HLA genetic factors include the INS (insulin), PTPN22 [protein tyrosine phosphatase, non-receptor type 22 (lymphoid)], and CTLA4 (cytotoxic T-lymphocyte–associated protein 4) genes and several others. These additional genetic factors may assist in assigning a probability for a diagnosis of type 1 diabetes of uncertain etiology.

### Prevention of type 1 diabetes: the time has come [^7a00f0ed]. Nature Clinical Practice: Endocrinology & Metabolism (2008). Medium credibility.

Improved understanding of the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes mellitus has completely changed our view of this disease in the past 25 years-from an acute, fulminant disease, to a chronic, autoimmune process. Information on genetic and serologic markers has increased our ability to identify individuals at risk. Prospectively gathered data indicate that, with a combination of immunologic and metabolic studies, children with a 6-year risk of disease higher than 90% can be identified due to an ongoing immune process. They differ from children with overt disease only in the time it will take for glucose levels to rise above a diagnostic threshold. Therapies to change the progression of beta-cell loss have been tested in patients with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes. With improved predictive capabilities and agents that can have longer-lasting effects than those tested more than 10 years ago, new prevention studies are underway. These studies are large and costly but the risks posed by such interventions compare favorably with those of developing hyperglycemia and of future complications portended by the diagnosis of diabetes. In this Review we discuss risk-stratification techniques and how they are applied, other diagnostic criteria, and outcomes from diabetes-prevention trials.

### Predicting type 1 diabetes using biomarkers [^55b640d0]. Diabetes Care (2015). Low credibility.

Clinical type 1 diabetes is preceded by an asymptomatic phase that can be identified by serum islet autoantibodies. This perspective proposes that there is now sufficient evidence to allow a broader use of islet autoantibodies as biomarkers to diagnose type 1 diabetes that is already at an asymptomatic stage, so that attempts to prevent clinical hyperglycemia become a feature of disease management. Prediction would first, therefore, shift toward the use of genetic and other biomarkers to determine the likelihood that islet autoimmunity will develop in an infant, and second, toward metabolic assessment to stage and biomarkers to determine the rate of progression to hyperglycemia in children in whom islet autoimmunity is diagnosed. A case is presented for future comprehensive risk assessment that commences at birth and includes attempts to predict, stage, and prevent initiation and progression of the disease process at multiple stages. The biomarkers required achieving this level of sophistication and dissemination are discussed.

2. Testing frequency.

There is no consensus on the optimal frequency of HbA 1c testing. The ADA recommends, "For any individual patient, the frequency of A1C testing should be dependent on the clinical situation, the treatment regimen used, and the judgment of the clinician". In the absence of well-controlled studies that suggest a definite testing protocol, expert opinion recommends HbA 1c testing "at least two times a year in patients who are meeting treatment goals (and who have stable glycemic control)… and quarterly in patients whose therapy has changed or who are not meeting glycemic goals". These testing recommendations are for nonpregnant patients with either type 1 or type 2 diabetes. In addition, all patients with diabetes who are admitted to a hospital should have HbA 1c measured if the results of testing in the previous 2–3 months are not available. Diabetes quality-assurance programs [e.g. Provider Recognition Program and HEDIS (Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set)] have generally required documentation of the percentage of diabetic patients who have had at least one HbA 1c measurement during the preceding year. Studies have established that serial HbA 1c measurements (quarterly for 1 year) produce large improvements in HbA 1c values in patients with type 1 diabetes.

3. Interpretation.

HbA 1c values in patients with diabetes constitute a continuum. They range from within the reference interval in a small percentage of patients whose mean plasma glucose concentrations are close to those of nondiabetic individuals, to markedly increased values (e.g. two- to threefold increases in some patients) that reflect an extreme degree of hyperglycemia. A proper interpretation of HbA 1c test results requires that physicians understand the relationship between HbA 1c values and mean plasma glucose, the kinetics of HbA 1c, and specific assay limitations/interferences. Small changes in HbA 1c (e.g. ± 0.3% HbA 1c) over time may reflect assay imprecision rather than a true change in glycemic status.

5. Emerging considerations

RECOMMENDATION: HbA 1c MAY BE USED FOR THE DIAGNOSIS OF DIABETES, WITH VALUES ≥ 6.5% BEING DIAGNOSTIC. AN NGSP-CERTIFIED METHOD SHOULD BE PERFORMED IN AN ACCREDITED LABORATORY. ANALOGOUS TO ITS USE IN THE MANAGEMENT OF DIABETES, FACTORS THAT INTERFERE WITH OR ADVERSELY AFFECT THE HbA 1c ASSAY WILL PRECLUDE ITS USE IN DIAGNOSIS A (moderate).

RECOMMENDATION: POINT-OF-CARE HbA 1c ASSAYS ARE NOT SUFFICIENTLY ACCURATE TO USE FOR THE DIAGNOSIS OF DIABETES B (moderate).

4 STAGING AND PROGRESSION TO CLINICAL DISEASE

The diagnosis of early‐stage type 1 diabetes is a step that identifies individuals who are likely to develop clinical type 1 diabetes later in life. Diagnosis activates and requires proper clinical care. A key aspect of this care, particularly in the context of potential therapies to delay progression, is the accurate diagnosis of Stage 1, which is associated with less than 20% 2‐year progression to clinical diabetes or Stage 2, which is associated with a 50% 2‐year progression rate. The defining distinction between these stages is glycaemic status: normoglycaemia in Stage 1 and dysglycaemia in Stage 2.

Over the past decade, the definition of dysglycaemia in early‐stage type 1 diabetes has evolved. Initially, it relied solely on impaired oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) values and subsequent confirmation. Later, it incorporated impaired HbA1c values and aligned the definition of impaired fasting glucose with those used in pre‐type 2 diabetes. A comparison of diagnostic criteria has revealed significant differences in the rates of progression to Stage 3 type 1 diabetes depending on the number and type of impaired values. While this variability could raise concerns, it also presents an opportunity to improve risk stratification (Table 2). Indeed, risk within Stage 2 type 1 diabetes can be stratified on the basis of the number and persistence of glycaemia abnormalities as well as the combination of abnormalities by blood glucose and HbA1c. Nevertheless, the OGTT is influenced by several factors — some controllable and others not — and there is sub‐optimal compliance in some studies. Alternative markers such as c‐peptide values during an OGTT, proinsulin‐c‐peptide ratios and values derived from continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) devices have been investigated. Although thresholds for dysglycaemia from these measurements have been proposed, this is still in its infancy, with substantial variability within and between studies, particularly for CGM. Nevertheless, we expect that once standardized, CGM will become a useful component for staging and stratification of risk in early‐stage type 1 diabetes.

American Diabetes Association Standards of Care in Diabetes — diagnostic tests and recommendations state that "Diabetes may be diagnosed based on A1C or plasma glucose criteria", with plasma glucose criteria including the fasting plasma glucose (FPG), 2-h plasma glucose (2-h PG) during a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), or random glucose accompanied by classic hyperglycemic symptoms or hyperglycemic crises (diabetic ketoacidosis [DKA] and/or hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state [HHS]). Recommendation 2.1a (B) directs to "Diagnose diabetes based on A1C or plasma glucose criteria" with these plasma glucose options, and recommendation 2.1b (B) states that "In the absence of unequivocal hyperglycemia (e.g., hyperglycemic crises), diagnosis requires confirmatory testing"; additionally, "FPG, 2-h PG during 75-g OGTT, and A1C are appropriate for screening and diagnosis".

### Guidelines and recommendations for laboratory analysis in the diagnosis and management of diabetes mellitus [^ac99c401]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Class II MHC molecules are involved in antigen presentation to CD4 helper cells, and the associations outlined above are likely to be explained by defective affinities to islet cell antigenic peptides, leading to persistence of T-helper cells that escape thymic ablation. Class I HLA molecules are also implicated in type 1 diabetes. Multiple non-HLA loci also contribute to susceptibility to type 1 diabetes. For example, the variable nucleotide tandem repeat (VNTR) upstream from the INS gene on chromosome 11q is useful for predicting the development of type 1 diabetes, with alleles with the longest VNTR having protective effects. Typing newborn infants for both HLA-DR and HLA - DQ — and to a lesser degree the INS gene — allows prediction of type 1 diabetes to better than 1 in 10 in the general population. The risk of type 1 diabetes in HLA-identical siblings of a proband with type 1 diabetes is 1 in 4, whereas siblings who have HLA haplotype identity have a 1 in 12 risk and those with no shared haplotype have a 1 in 100 risk. Genome-wide association studies have confirmed that the following non-HLA genetic factors increase the risk for type 1 diabetes, both in first-degree relatives of type 1 diabetic patients and in the general population: INS, VNTR, CTLA4, PTPN22, and others.

5. Emerging considerations

The sequencing of the human genome and the formation of consortia have produced advances in the identification of the genetic bases for both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. This progress should ultimately lead to family counseling, prognostic information, and the selection of optimal treatments.

No therapeutic intervention that will prevent diabetes has been identified. Therefore, although several islet cell autoantibodies have been detected in individuals with type 1 diabetes, their measurement has limited use outside of clinical studies. Currently, islet cell autoantibodies are not used in routine management of patients with diabetes. This section focuses on the pragmatic aspects of clinical laboratory testing for islet cell autoantibodies.

1. Diagnosis.

In type 1 diabetes, the pancreatic islet β-cells are destroyed and lost. In the vast majority of these patients, the destruction is mediated by an autoimmune attack. This disease is termed "type 1A" or "immune-mediated diabetes" (Table 1). Islet cell autoantibodies comprise autoantibodies to islet cell cytoplasm (ICA), to native insulin [referred to as "insulin autoantibodies" (IAA)], to the 65-kDa isoform of glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD65A), to two insulinoma antigen 2 proteins [IA-2A and IA-2βA (also known as phogrin)], and to three variants of zinc transporter 8 (ZnT8A). Autoantibody markers of immune destruction are usually present in 85% to 90% of individuals with type 1 diabetes when fasting hyperglycemia is initially detected. Autoimmune destruction of β-cells has multiple genetic predispositions and is modulated by undefined environmental influences. The autoimmunity may be present for months or years before the onset of hyperglycemia and subsequent symptoms of diabetes. After years of type 1 diabetes, some antibodies fall below detection limits, but GAD65A usually remains increased. Patients with type 1A diabetes have a significantly increased risk of other autoimmune disorders, including celiac disease, Graves disease, thyroiditis, Addison disease, and pernicious anemia. As many as 1 in 4 females with type 1 diabetes have autoimmune thyroid disease, whereas 1 in 280 patients develop adrenal autoantibodies and adrenal insufficiency. A minority of patients with type 1 diabetes (type 1B, idiopathic) have no known etiology and no evidence of autoimmunity. Many of these patients are of African or Asian origin.

### How do we identify people at high risk of type 2 diabetes and help prevent the condition from developing? [^08205087]. Diabetic Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Identification

While the diagnostic thresholds for Type 2 diabetes are accepted, international consensus on whether and how to classify those at high risk of Type 2 diabetes has not been achieved. Identifying those at high risk of developing Type 2 diabetes requires a detailed understanding of the relationships between epidemiological and clinical risk factors, in addition to laboratory test results. At a global level these relationships are likely to vary within and between countries and populations in ways which are not yet fully understood 1. There is ongoing debate about which test to use and each test's corresponding inclusion threshold, where the balance of clinical benefits and harms sit when defining such a threshold, and how affordability of subsequent appropriate preventative interventions might influence the derivation of such thresholds in different populations.

Formal classifications have tended to rely on laboratory test results. One or more of three tests are used to define the diagnostic thresholds for Type 2 diabetes diagnosis, and a second lower inclusion threshold to define high risk. The three tests are: the 2‐h 75‐g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) glucose value, fasting plasma glucose (FPG) value, and HbA 1c value. Test values between the high risk inclusion and diagnostic thresholds for any one of the tests may be used to classify individuals as high risk, and eligible for targeted interventions to prevent Type 2 diabetes. Table 1 outlines the different descriptors of high risk using each test or combination of tests, and their definitions.

### Standardizing T-Cell biomarkers in type 1 diabetes: challenges and recent advances [^ad85ecd9]. Diabetes (2019). Medium credibility.

Type 1 diabetes (T1D) results from the progressive destruction of pancreatic β-cells in a process mediated primarily by T lymphocytes. The T1D research community has made dramatic progress in understanding the genetic basis of the disease as well as in the development of standardized autoantibody assays that inform both disease risk and progression. Despite these advances, there remains a paucity of robust and accepted biomarkers that can effectively inform on the activity of T cells during the natural history of the disease or in response to treatment. In this article, we discuss biomarker development and validation efforts for evaluation of T-cell responses in patients with and at risk for T1D as well as emerging technologies. It is expected that with systematic planning and execution of a well-conceived biomarker development pipeline, T-cell-related biomarkers would rapidly accelerate disease progression monitoring efforts and the evaluation of intervention therapies in T1D.

3.2 Diagnosis of diabetes

At symptomatic stages, diabetes diagnosis is traditionally made based on measurements of dysglycaemia. This includes elevated haemoglobin A1c levels, as well as elevated fasting or random plasma glucose levels (Table 2). The haemoglobin A1c is a measure of glycated haemoglobin, an indirect measure of glucose exposure, that can estimate the average glucose level over the preceding 2–3 months. Although convenient as a screening tool, it has lower sensitivity than other methods and limited utility in individuals with certain hemoglobinopathies or increased red blood cell turnover, such as pregnant women or those with anaemia. It can also be affected by liver or kidney disease and certain medications. Diagnosis can also be made based on plasma glucose levels measured fasting, as part of an oral glucose tolerance test, or with elevated random levels in the setting of symptomatic hyperglycaemia. Given that fasting and random glucose levels can also be influenced by transient factors such as physical activity levels, illness, or acute stress response, oral glucose tolerance testing may be required to identify individuals with mild or moderate hyperglycaemia.

TABLE 2
Clinical tools used for the diagnosis and classification of diabetes.

The oral glucose tolerance test is typically performed by measuring plasma glucose levels 2 hours after administering a 75‐gram glucose load to a fasting patient. The increased sensitivity makes the oral glucose tolerance test preferable for screening certain individuals, including those at risk for cystic fibrosis‐related diabetes and post‐transplant diabetes. It is also the recommended diagnostic tool for gestational diabetes, although the glucose loads, timing, and diagnostic criteria differ for gestational diabetes. Oral glucose tolerance testing is also now being used to screen individuals with positive islet autoantibodies for dysglycaemia, aiming to identify individuals with Stage 2 type 1 diabetes who may benefit from teplizumab therapy to delay the onset of symptomatic diabetes. Multiple strategies have been suggested to implement screening programmes to identify high‐risk individuals who would benefit from ongoing autoantibody and oral glucose tolerance test screening for early‐stage type 1 diabetes and dysglycaemia. Although continuous glucose monitors are now widely used in the management of diabetes, they are not currently recommended for use in diagnosis. However, there is increasing evidence that because they provide more longitudinal data, the use of continuous glucose monitors may be more effective, even than oral glucose tolerance testing, in detecting early dysglycaemia in early stages of type 2 diabetes and in other high‐risk populations.

### A practical review of C-peptide testing in diabetes [^ae066f7c]. Diabetes Therapy (2017). Low credibility.

C-peptide is a widely used measure of pancreatic beta cell function. It is produced in equimolar amounts to endogenous insulin but is excreted at a more constant rate over a longer time. Methods of estimation include urinary and unstimulated and stimulated serum sampling. Modern assays detect levels of c-peptide which can be used to guide diabetes diagnosis and management. We explore the evidence behind the various tests available. We recommend the glucagon stimulation c-peptide testing owing to its balance of sensitivity and practicality. C-peptide levels are associated with diabetes type and duration of disease. Specifically a c-peptide level of less than 0.2 nmol/l is associated with a diagnosis of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). C-peptide level may correlate with microvascular and macrovascular complications and future use of insulin therapy, as well as likely response to other individual therapies. We explore the potential uses of c-peptide measurement in clinical practice.

2. Screening.

Only about 15% of patients with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes have a first-degree relative with the disease. The risk of developing type 1 diabetes in relatives of patients with the disease is approximately 5%, which is 15-fold higher than the risk in the general population (1 in 250–300 lifetime risk). Screening relatives of type 1 diabetic patients for islet cell autoantibodies can identify those at high risk for the disease; however, as many as 1%–2% of healthy individuals have a single autoantibody against insulin, IA-2, GAD65, or ZnT8 and are at low risk of developing type 1 diabetes. Because of the low prevalence of type 1 diabetes (approximately 0.3% in the general population), the positive predictive value of a single islet cell autoantibody will be low. The presence of multiple islet cell autoantibodies (IAA, GAD65A, IA-2A/IA-2βA, or ZnT8A) is associated with a > 90% risk of type 1 diabetes; however, until cost-effective screening strategies can be developed for young children and until effective intervention therapy to prevent or delay the onset of the disease becomes available, such testing cannot be recommended outside of a research setting.

Children with certain HLA-DR and/or HLA-DQB1 chains (*0602/✱0603/✱0301) are mostly protected from type 1 diabetes, but not from developing islet cell autoantibodies. Because islet cell autoantibodies in these individuals have substantially reduced predictive significance, they are often excluded from prevention trials.

Approximately 5%–10% of adult Caucasian patients who present with a type 2 diabetes phenotype also have islet cell autoantibodies, particularly GAD65A, which predict insulin dependency. This condition has been termed "latent autoimmune diabetes of adulthood" (LADA), "type 1.5 diabetes", or "slowly progressive IDDM". Although GAD65A-positive diabetic patients progress faster to absolute insulinopenia than do antibody-negative patients, many antibody-negative (type 2) diabetic adults also progress (albeit more slowly) to insulin dependency with time. Some of these patients may show T-cell reactivity to islet cell components. Islet cell autoantibody testing in patients with type 2 diabetes has limited utility, because the institution of insulin therapy is based on glucose control.

### The pathophysiology, presentation and classification of type 1 diabetes [^8b94c77a]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Despite this complexity, certain characteristics in presentation and clinical tools can be utilized for the classification and phenotypic characterization of individual patients, guiding clinical decision‐making (see Table 2). Although both type 1 and type 2 diabetes can present at any age, the age of onset and initial presentation often help in classifying type 1 diabetes. Most individuals with type 1 diabetes present with symptoms of hyperglycaemia, but younger patients present more commonly with diabetic ketoacidosis. At initial diagnosis, 25%–50% of children present in diabetic ketoacidosis, as opposed to 6%–21% of adults. Though use of GRS has not yet been incorporated into standard clinical practice, measuring serum levels of islet autoantibodies and confirming low C‐peptide levels can also aid in classifying type 1 diabetes. Some of these classic phenotypic features, including age, body mass index, and race, have even been shown to predict autoantibody positivity in individuals with type 1 diabetes upon presentation. Current recommendations for classification in adults acknowledge the importance of incorporating multiple tools in patients who are autoantibody negative, including clinical features, C‐peptide testing, and, in some cases, genetic testing for monogenic diabetes.

Variability in the intensity and timing of autoimmune β‐cell destruction is a significant source of heterogeneity in type 1 diabetes. Many individuals experience a brief period of partial remission, known as the honeymoon period, after initiating insulin therapy. However, disease in younger children appears to be commonly associated with a higher number of autoantibodies, fewer insulin‐containing islets, and lower serum C‐peptide concentrations. These individuals also tend to have high‐risk HLA haplotypes. While a more intense autoimmune attack is often associated with a younger age at diagnosis, it is unclear whether increased susceptibility of the developing islets and β‐cells may also contribute to earlier decline in functional β‐cell mass. In contrast, adults diagnosed with type 1 diabetes often have a slower time course of autoimmune β‐cell destruction, leading to older age at onset of symptoms. Some of these adults with classic presenting symptoms and absolute insulin deficiency do not have autoantibodies on diagnosis and are referred to as having idiopathic type 1 diabetes. Although it is presumed that their pathology is due to autoimmunity, with potential negative seroconversion, it is unclear whether some of these cases represent alternative β‐cell pathology. However, to distinguish these individuals from those with monogenic diabetes, genetic testing for monogenic diabetes can be considered in paediatric or adult individuals who are antibody negative and have a milder clinical course, with lower insulin requirements and without ketosis.

Type 1 diabetes — autoantibody natural history and early detection highlight that the persistent presence of two or more islet autoantibodies is a near-certain predictor of clinical diabetes; in at-risk cohorts followed from birth or a very young age, seroconversion rarely occurs before 6 months of age with a peak between 9 and 24 months of age; and glucose and A1C changes (e.g., changes in fasting plasma glucose [FPG] or 2-h plasma glucose [2-h PG]) can occur about 6 months before diagnosis, enabling diagnosis before clinical onset.

### Current and future efforts toward the prevention of type 1 diabetes [^370672dd]. Pediatric Diabetes (2016). Low credibility.

Great strides have been made in our understanding of the natural history of 'pre-type 1' diabetes as well as in the post diagnosis period. For now, an inability to successfully prevent the disease limits screening outside of the research setting. While studies of both humans with various levels of risk for type 1 diabetes as well as animal models for the disease have increased our understanding of the disorder, the development of a safe and effective therapeutic intervention capable of reversing or preventing type 1 diabetes remains elusive. Worldwide primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention studies have been undertaken and both past and current studies are extensively reviewed in this manuscript. Intervention studies in new-onset and established type 1 diabetes patients have to date shown fairly limited success with most effects seen within the first 6–12 months post therapy. Long-term outcome remains to be determined. Improved and innovative trial designs, more rapid testing of both antigen specific and combination therapies in different populations (at-risk, new-onset, and established type 1 diabetes), continuing to fill the mechanistic voids in the etiopathogenesis of type 1 diabetes, and the development of validated biomarkers will hasten efforts toward reversing and preventing the disease. For successful prevention, therapy must be safe and must target not only effective control of the autoimmune process culminating in type 1 diabetes but also protection or replacement of lost β-cell function.

Table 2.4 — Staging of type 1 diabetes defines three stages by autoimmunity and glycemia. Stage 1 includes autoimmunity with normoglycemia and is presymptomatic, with multiple islet autoantibodies and no impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) or impaired fasting glucose (IFG), normal A1C. Stage 2 includes autoimmunity with dysglycemia and is presymptomatic; diagnostic criteria include islet autoantibodies (usually multiple) plus dysglycemia defined by IFG: FPG 100–125 mg/dL (5.6–6.9 mmol/L), or IGT: 2-h PG 140–199 mg/dL (7.8–11.0 mmol/L), or A1C 5.7–6.4% (39–47 mmol/mol) or ≥ 10% increase in A1C. Stage 3 includes autoimmunity with overt hyperglycemia and symptomatic disease; diagnostic criteria are diabetes by standard criteria, and autoantibodies may become absent. Alternate additional stage 2 criteria used in trials are 30-, 60-, or 90-min plasma glucose on oral glucose tolerance test ≥ 200 mg/dL (≥ 11.1 mmol/L) with confirmatory testing in those aged ≥ 18 years; dysglycemia can be defined by one or more criteria.

4. Interpretation

GAD65A may be present in approximately 60%–80% of patients with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes, but the frequency varies with sex and age. GAD65A is associated with HLA DR3–DQA1✱0501–DQB1✱0201 in both patients and healthy individuals. IA-2As may be present in 40%–50% of patients with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes, but the frequency is highest in the young. The frequency decreases with increasing age. IA-2As are associated with HLA DR4–DQA1✱0301–DQB1✱0302. IAA positivity occurs in > 70%–80% of children who develop type 1 diabetes before 5 years of age but occurs in < 40% of individuals who develop diabetes after the age of 12 years. IAAs are associated with HLA DR4–DQA1✱0301–DQB1✱0302 and with INS VNTR. ICA is found in about 75%–85% of new-onset patients.

The ICA assay is labor-intensive and difficult to standardize, and marked interlaboratory variation in sensitivity and specificity has been demonstrated in workshops. Few clinical laboratories are likely to implement this test. The immunoassays are more reproducible and are amenable to standardization. Measurement of T-cell reactivity in peripheral blood is theoretically appealing, but the imprecision of such assays precludes their use from a clinical setting. Autoantibody positivity (by definition) occurs in healthy individuals despite an absence of a family history of autoimmune diseases. Islet cell autoantibodies are no exception. If one autoantibody is found, the others should be assayed, because the risk of type 1 diabetes increases if an individual tests positive for two or more autoantibodies.

The following suggestions have been proposed as a rational approach to the use of autoantibodies in diabetes: 1) antibody assays should have a specificity > 99%; 2) proficiency testing should be documented; 3) multiple autoantibodies should be assayed; and 4) sequential measurement should be performed. These strategies will reduce false-positive and false-negative results.

### Glycemia testing to diagnose type 2 diabetes mellitus… [^0c3fdbe4]. AAFP (2003). Low credibility.

Diabetes is a major medical problem with high morbidity and mortality. The American Diabetes Association divides diabetes into two types: the more common type 2 diabetes, which occurs most frequently among obese older adults and is characterized by insulin resistance and slightly decreased insulin secretion, and type 1 diabetes, which occurs among younger persons and is characterized by clearly deficient insulin production. Barr and associates reviewed the diagnostic tests for diabetes. The most recent ADA guidelines made fasting plasma glucose the main tool to diagnose diabetes in nonpregnant adults and defined a new category of "impaired fasting glucose". Current diagnostic tests of diabetes include random plasma glucose, fasting plasma glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin. Casual is defined as any time of day without regard to time since last meal. The classic symptoms of diabetes include polyuria, polydipsia, and unexplained weight loss. |.

The authors conclude that an HbA 1c level that is two standard deviations above the mean is highly suggestive of diabetes, but that the diagnosis requires confirmation by finding either a random plasma glucose level higher than 200 mg per dL or a fasting plasma glucose level higher than 126 mg per dL. This might easily be done in the office setting by testing random glucose and HbA 1c levels at the same time. If both tests are positive, the diagnosis is made. If only one test is positive, a fasting test can evaluate for diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance.

1. Use

RECOMMENDATION: HbA 1c SHOULD BE MEASURED ROUTINELY IN ALL PATIENTS WITH DIABETES MELLITUS TO DOCUMENT THEIR DEGREE OF GLYCEMIC CONTROL A (moderate).

Measurement of glycated proteins, primarily HbA 1c, is widely used for routine monitoring of long-term glycemic status in patients with diabetes. [The terms "glycated hemoglobin", "glycohemoglobin", "glycosylated" (which should not be used), "glucosylated hemoglobin", "HbA 1", and "HbA 1c " have all been used to refer to hemoglobin that has been modified by the nonenzymatic addition of glucose. These terms are not interchangeable, however. The current acceptable term for glycation of hemoglobin in general is "glycated hemoglobin" (GHb). HbA 1c is the specific glycated species that is modified by glucose on the N terminus of the hemoglobin β chain. "HbA 1c " is also the internationally accepted term for reporting all GHb results. Assay methods that measure total GHbs (e.g. boronate affinity methods) should be calibrated to report an equivalent HbA 1c and be reported as HbA 1c for purposes of harmonization of results. HbA 1 is composed of HbA 1a, HbA 1b, and HbA 1c and should not be measured or reported. The term "A1C test" is used by the ADA in place of HbA 1c to facilitate communication with patients. As described in the text, most of the clinical-outcome data that are available for the effects of metabolic control on complications (at least for the DCCT and UKPDS) involved the use of assay methods that quantified HbA 1c. In this report, we use the abbreviation GHb to include all forms of glycated hemoglobin.] HbA 1c is used both as an index of mean glycemia and as a measure of risk for the development of diabetes complications. HbA 1c testing and maintenance of specified concentrations during pregnancy in patients with preexisting type 1 or type 2 diabetes are important for maximizing the health of the newborn and decreasing perinatal risks for the mother. Specifically, stringent control of HbA 1c values during pregnancy decreases the risk of congenital malformations, large-for-date infants, and the complications of pregnancy and delivery that can otherwise occur when glycemic control is not carefully managed. A recent consensus statement recommends an HbA 1c value of < 6% (42 mmol/mol) in these patients if it can be achieved without excessive hypoglycemia. HbA 1c is also being used increasingly by quality-assurance programs to assess the quality of diabetes care (e.g. requiring that healthcare providers document the frequency of HbA 1c testing in patients with diabetes and the proportion of patients with HbA 1c values below a specified value).

5. Emerging considerations

Immunoassays for IAA, GAD65A, IA-2A/IA-2βA, and ZnT8A are now available, and a panel of these autoantibodies is currently used in screening studies. Because ICA assays are difficult to standardize, their use has declined substantially.

It is likely that other islet cell antigens will be discovered, and such discoveries could lead to additional diagnostic and predictive tests for type 1 diabetes. Autoantibody screening of dried spots obtained from finger-stick blood samples appears quite feasible in the future. For individuals who are positive for islet cell autoantibodies, HLA-DR / HLA-DQ genotyping will help define the absolute risk of type 1 diabetes.

Several clinical trials to prevent or intervene with type 1 diabetes are being actively pursued. Such trials can now be done with relatives of patients with type 1 diabetes or in the general population on the basis of the islet cell autoantibody and HLA-DR / HLA-DQ genotype status. Risk can be assessed by islet cell autoantibodies alone, without the need for evaluating endogenous insulin reserves, as was done for the U.S. DPT-1 trial. Rates of islet cell autoantibody positivity are distinctly lower in the general population than in relatives of individuals with type 1 diabetes; consequently, trials with the latter group are more economical. Potential interventional therapies (for type 1 diabetes) undergoing clinical trials include oral insulin or nasal insulin given to nondiabetic (but islet cell autoantibody–positive) relatives of individuals with type 1 diabetes or to children with islet cell autoantibodies and HLA genotypes conferring increased risk. Phase II clinical trials with alum-formulated GAD65 have reported no adverse events and some preservation of endogenous insulin production in GAD65A-positive diabetic patients. Additional trials of other antigen-based immunotherapies, adjuvants, cytokines, and T-cell accessory molecule–blocking agents are likely in the future. Decreased islet cell autoimmunity will be one important outcome measure of these therapies.

ALBUMINURIA (FORMERLY MICROALBUMINURIA)

Albuminuria (formerly microalbuminuria) are a well-established cardiovascular risk marker, in which increases over time to macroalbuminuria (> 300 mg/day) are associated with kidney disease and an increased risk for progression to end-stage renal disease. Annual testing for albuminuria is recommended by all major guidelines for patients with diabetes and/or kidney disease. To be useful, semiquantitative or qualitative screening tests must be shown to be positive in > 95% of patients with albuminuria. Positive results of such tests must be confirmed by quantitative testing in an accredited laboratory.

3 PRACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR SCREENING

3.1 The importance of a priori risk — The case for multiple tests

Most medical diagnoses rely on multiple clinical or biomarker values to ensure certainty of disease. The mathematics are simple and based on Bayes' theorem, which, for our purpose, infers that the likelihood that a positive test accurately indicates disease increases when the test is applied in populations with high disease prevalence. For instance, a test for diagnosing disease in individuals with classic symptoms typically yields high diagnostic certainty. Conversely, applying the same test in a low‐prevalence population, such as screening for a disease with a prevalence of 3 in 1000, results in more false positives than true positives (Figure 1). The trade‐off between certainty (positive predictive value) and sensitivity (the proportion of true cases detected) often defines the diagnostic strategy. For severe, highly contagious diseases requiring immediate action, high sensitivity is prioritized, even at the cost of certainty. Conversely, in conditions where treatment can be delayed or has significant side effects, high diagnostic certainty is preferred, even at the expense of sensitivity. The first would require a test that identifies close to 100% of cases quickly and the second can perform multiple tests consecutively to reach a diagnosis. Diagnosing early‐stage type 1 diabetes falls into the high‐certainty category and is best achieved through multiple sequential tests.

FIGURE 1
Effect of a priori probability on screening. The example shows the application of an islet autoantibody screening test that has a threshold for positivity set to the 99th centile of healthy controls (99% specificity). The threshold identifies 90% of the disease group (90% sensitivity). In a case‐control setting often used to evaluate the performance of a test (A), false positives are infrequent. Case B shows the performance of the same test in general population screening, where the a priori disease prevalence is 0.4% (4000 from 1 million tested). With 99% specificity in health and 90% sensitivity in disease, the test is expected to identify 3600 type 1 diabetes cases (90% of the total cases) plus another 9960 who will not develop type 1 diabetes, with a positive predictive value (PPV) of 27%.

Pancreatic Autoantibodies

Pancreatic autoantibodies are characteristic of type 1 diabetes. Highly sensitive laboratory measurements capture ∼98% of individuals with autoantibodies at diagnosis. Unfortunately, most commercial laboratories do not have reliably sensitive or specific assays that measure all five autoantibodies: GADA, islet cell antibodies (ICA), insulin autoantibodies (IAA), protein tyrosine phosphatase antibodies (ICA512 or IA2A), and zinc transporter protein (ZnT8). Thus, it may be inappropriate to report a patient as autoantibody negative. Another cause of "false-negative" autoantibodies is testing far out from diagnosis as antibody titers diminish over time (Fig. 1). It appears that there is an increased incidence of type 1 diabetes in ethnic populations where autoantibody markers may be of variable utility, such as in Asians where autoantibodies are often negative.

Figure 1
The percentage of antibody-positive subjects is affected by the duration of type 1 diabetes for GADA (A) and IA2A (B). Given an increase in the scatter (due to lower numbers of subjects), the x-axis is truncated at a duration of 30 years. Reproduced with permission from Tridgell et al.

Family History

Type 1 diabetes has a genetic predilection and, in some cases, can be predicted in family members. The overall prevalence of type 1 diabetes in the U.S. is ∼0.3%, but if a first-degree relative has diabetes, the empiric risk of being affected is ∼5%, representing a 15-fold increase among family members. Studies evaluating children at risk for developing type 1 diabetes have shown that the presence of more than two autoantibodies was associated with a nearly 70% risk for disease development within 10 years and 84% within 15 years. Evaluating at-risk individuals in the clinical setting is not yet recommended due to limited clinical interventions; however, ongoing research studies are identifying at-risk individuals through genetic testing in both the lower-risk general population and in the higher-risk population of relatives of people with type 1 diabetes.

The diagnostic performance of various diabetes indicators is in need of careful evaluation. Redefining a lower threshold for HbA 1c will be more optimal for diagnosing diabetes. Further understanding of the relationship between known markers of clinical disease (HbA 1c, FPG, random glucose, and OGTT) and T1D symptoms and complications with a focus on when to initiate treatment is needed. Until then, the OGTT, a sensitive indicator of diabetes and an early marker of impaired glucose homeostasis, is the better diagnostic option for T1D.

### Type 1 diabetes presenting in adults: trends, diagnostic challenges and unique features [^2ae1d77a]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Type 1 diabetes (T1D) has been historically regarded as a childhood-onset disease; however, recent epidemiological data indicate that adult-onset T1D accounts for a substantial proportion of cases worldwide. There is evidence that adult-onset T1D is associated with the classic T1D triad of elevated genetic risk, the presence of islet-specific autoantibodies and progression to severe insulin deficiency. In this article, we review our understanding of the commonalities and differences between childhood and adult-onset T1D, and we highlight significant knowledge gaps in our understanding of the diagnosis, incidence, trajectory and treatment of adult-onset T1D. Compared to children, adults presenting with T1D exhibit differences in genetic risk, immunologic profiles and metabolic outcomes, including differences in the type and number of autoantibodies present, genetic associations and total genetic burden, rates of C-peptide decline, the persistence of C-peptide in long-duration disease and glycaemic control. In addition, obesity and metabolic syndrome are increasingly common in adults, which not only blurs the clinical distinction of adult-onset T1D from type 2 diabetes (T2D) but also likely contributes to differences in metabolic outcomes and rates of progression. Because T2D is so prevalent in the adult population, adult-onset T1D is misclassified as T2D in at least one in three cases, leading to delays in appropriate treatment. Current diagnostic tools, including autoantibody testing and C-peptide measurement, are underutilised or lack specificity in distinguishing adult-onset T1D from atypical T2D. Additionally, the impact of different responses to disease-modifying therapy between adults and children is unclear. Addressing these knowledge gaps requires expanded epidemiological studies, diverse patient registries and refined classification criteria to improve early detection and treatment strategies. A deeper understanding of adult-onset T1D will be critical to reduce the burden of misdiagnosis, lead to earlier diagnosis and treatment and optimise population-based screening approaches in this under-recognised population. PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY: Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease that causes metabolic and nutritional complications due to the destruction of insulin-producing pancreatic β cells. T1D was formerly known as "juvenile diabetes" because it was assumed that most cases occurred in childhood; however, recent epidemiological data show that nearly half of all T1D cases are diagnosed in adulthood. Despite the high prevalence of adult-onset T1D, there are challenges with correctly diagnosing T1D in adulthood, and significant knowledge gaps remain regarding the incidence, trajectory, and treatment of adult-onset T1D. In this article, we summarize the current understanding of commonalities and differences between childhood and adult-onset T1D. Particularly, we highlight age-related differences in genetic risk, immunologic profiles, and metabolic outcomes and complications. Finally, we highlight key gaps in our understanding of adult-onset T1D that need to be addressed to reduce the burden of misdiagnosis and allow for better screening and treatment of T1D in adulthood.

### Type 1 diabetes prevention: a goal dependent on accepting a diagnosis of an asymptomatic disease [^18e1563b]. Diabetes (2016). Low credibility.

Type 1 diabetes, a disease defined by absolute insulin deficiency, is considered a chronic autoimmune disorder resulting from the destruction of insulin-producing pancreatic β-cells. The incidence of childhood-onset type 1 diabetes has been increasing at a rate of 3%-5% per year globally. Despite the introduction of an impressive array of therapies aimed at improving disease management, no means for a practical "cure" exist. This said, hope remains high that any of a number of emerging technologies (e.g., continuous glucose monitoring, insulin pumps, smart algorithms), alongside advances in stem cell biology, cell encapsulation methodologies, and immunotherapy, will eventually impact the lives of those with recently diagnosed or established type 1 diabetes. However, efforts aimed at reversing insulin dependence do not address the obvious benefits of disease prevention. Hence, key "stretch goals" for type 1 diabetes research include identifying improved and increasingly practical means for diagnosing the disease at earlier stages in its natural history (i.e., early, presymptomatic diagnosis), undertaking such efforts in the population at large to optimally identify those with presymptomatic type 1 diabetes, and introducing safe and effective therapeutic options for prevention.

B. Monitoring/prognosis.

No acceptable therapy has been demonstrated to prolong the survival of islet cells once diabetes has been diagnosed or to prevent the clinical onset of diabetes in islet cell autoantibody–positive individuals. Thus, the use of repeated testing for islet cell autoantibodies to monitor islet cell autoimmunity is not clinically useful at present. In islet cell or pancreas transplantation, the presence or absence of islet cell autoantibodies may clarify whether subsequent failure of the transplanted islets is due to recurrent autoimmune disease or to rejection. When a partial pancreas has been transplanted from an identical twin or other HLA-identical sibling, the appearance of islet cell autoantibodies may raise consideration regarding the use of immunosuppressive agents to try to halt the recurrence of diabetes. Notwithstanding these theoretical advantages, the value of this therapeutic strategy has not been established.

Some experts have proposed that testing for islet cell autoantibodies may be useful in the following situations: 1) to identify a subset of adults initially thought to have type 2 diabetes but who have islet cell autoantibody markers of type 1 diabetes and who progress to insulin dependency; 2) to screen nondiabetic family members who wish to donate a kidney or part of their pancreas for transplantation; 3) to screen women with GDM to identify those at high risk of progression to type 1 diabetes; and 4) to distinguish type 1 from type 2 diabetes in children to institute insulin therapy at the time of diagnosis. For example, some pediatric diabetologists now treat children thought to have type 2 diabetes with oral medications but treat autoantibody-positive children immediately with insulin. It is possible, however, to follow patients who are islet cell autoantibody positive to the point of metabolic decompensation and then institute insulin therapy. The Diabetes Prevention Trial of Type 1 Diabetes (DPT-1) study failed to show a protective effect of parenteral insulin.

Two major accomplishments in the field of prediction and prevention have had important implications for type 1 diabetes (T1D), as well as other immune-mediated diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). First, individuals destined to develop T1D can now be identified by testing for the presence of autoantibodies, long before signs or symptoms of clinical disease. Second, there is now an FDA-approved therapy to delay disease progression. These accomplishments were made possible by more than 4 decades of multicenter research, sustained commitments from funders, a culture of collaboration that enabled international standardization of autoantibody measurements, and common entry criteria and outcome measures for clinical trials. Robust data find that essentially everybody with 2 or more autoantibodies will eventually progress to clinical disease. This concept is now codified as stages of T1D, whereby those with multiple autoantibodies are considered to have early-stage disease. This provided a pathway for regulatory approval by clarifying that therapy was aimed at treating people with disease in contrast to preventing disease in healthy individuals and has helped antibody-positive individuals understand risk. Translating these scientific accomplishments into clinical practice remains challenging, but the availability of an approved therapy to delay T1D onset suggests that such translation is on the horizon for T1D and ultimately for other immune-mediated diseases.

### Type 1 diabetes risk factors, risk prediction and presymptomatic detection: evidence and guidance for screening [^9602a031]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

8 CONCLUSION

Significant progress has been made in understanding early‐stage type 1 diabetes and establishing screening protocols, which allow screening for early‐stage type 1 diabetes to be introduced into regular health care. Alongside this, much work remains to ensure that screening is applied effectively and equitably. It will be essential to continue research into the psychological, economic and global aspects of screening, as well as to address the logistical challenges associated with its widespread implementation. If we aim to maximize the benefits of early detection and delay clinical onset, coordinated efforts and substantial investment are necessary to ensure the success and sustainability of these screening programmes.

### C-peptide determination in the diagnosis of type of diabetes and its management: a clinical perspective [^7f649bb4]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

4.1.2 Clinical outlook in classical type 1 diabetes

Heterogeneity of C‐peptide levels exists before, and at the time of clinical diagnosis of type 1 diabetes. The assessment of C‐peptide during the prodromic phase of type 1 diabetes (i.e. after seroconversion but before clinical onset) has been proposed as a marker to predict progression towards the disease in at‐risk children. After clinical onset, measurement of C‐peptide may be helpful to confirm insulin deficiency in patients with signs of diabetes‐related autoimmunity, without having a clear phenotype for type 1 diabetes, or who have a strong family history of diabetes suggesting monogenic diabetes. In this regard, it is estimated that about 15%‐40% of people with type 1 diabetes are no longer lean, having become overweight or frankly obese, and there is concern that the percentage of people with type 1 diabetes who become overweight is increasing globally. Some people with obesity and type 1 diabetes develop characteristics of the metabolic syndrome and require high doses of insulin. This phenotype has also been named 'double diabetes' because the phenotype mimics both type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes.

3.2 Decision trees and the 2 × 2 × 2 principle to diagnose early‐stage type 1 diabetes

The application of sequential testing in screening resembles a decision tree with a series of AND and OR commands. Certain factors, such as family history of type 1 diabetes or age, can be considered early in the decision tree without requiring a sample or test. The sequence of tests is usually determined by factors such as cost, ease of application and test sensitivity. Highly sensitive tests are often used sequentially with AND commands, while less sensitive tests can be combined using OR commands to improve overall sensitivity. For example, 'first‐degree relative with type 1 diabetes' alone has low sensitivity but combining it with 'PRS > 90th percentile' in an OR command yields high sensitivity for detecting early‐stage type 1 diabetes. Decision trees should be simple and practical. Two examples of childhood screening strategies are discussed (Figure 2).

FIGURE 2
Early‐stage type 1 diabetes screening strategy decision tree options. Option A starts with islet autoantibody testing in all children with a series of AND commands leading to second assays and samples depending upon the screening test and confirmation test results. Option B includes an a priori selection based on genetic risk with OR commands that identify a subset of the population to be tested for islet autoantibodies following the AND command decision tree. The efficiency of screening, and in particular for option B, is dependent upon the recall rates achieved for autoantibody testing.

The first approach begins with autoantibody testing. Timing is critical: screening too late misses cases of clinical type 1 diabetes that manifest early, while screening too early fails to capture those who seroconvert later. Current estimates, suggest:
Screening at age 3 years identifies ~35% of cases progressing to clinical type 1 diabetes by age 18.
Screening at ages 2 and 6 years captures ~65% of cases.
Screening at ages 2, 6 and 10 years identifies approximately 80% of cases.

### New advances in type 1 diabetes [^581d9071]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune condition resulting in insulin deficiency and eventual loss of pancreatic β cell function requiring lifelong insulin therapy. Since the discovery of insulin more than 100 years ago, vast advances in treatments have improved care for many people with type 1 diabetes. Ongoing research on the genetics and immunology of type 1 diabetes and on interventions to modify disease course and preserve β cell function have expanded our broad understanding of this condition. Biomarkers of type 1 diabetes are detectable months to years before development of overt disease, and three stages of diabetes are now recognized. The advent of continuous glucose monitoring and the newer automated insulin delivery systems have changed the landscape of type 1 diabetes management and are associated with improved glycated hemoglobin and decreased hypoglycemia. Adjunctive therapies such as sodium glucose cotransporter-1 inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists may find use in management in the future. Despite these rapid advances in the field, people living in under-resourced parts of the world struggle to obtain necessities such as insulin, syringes, and blood glucose monitoring essential for managing this condition. This review covers recent developments in diagnosis and treatment and future directions in the broad field of type 1 diabetes.

### C-peptide determination in the diagnosis of type of diabetes and its management: a clinical perspective [^0e2a001e]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

4.3 C‐peptide to differentiate type 2 diabetes from autoimmune diabetes?

A joint ADA/EASD consensus report on the management of type 1 diabetes in adultsrecommended the evaluation of C‐peptide beyond 3 years after diabetes diagnosis in autoantibody‐negative adults receiving insulin treatment, with C‐peptide values of less than 0.20 nmol/L suggesting a diagnosis of type 1 diabetes and values of more than 0.60 nmol/L indicating type 2 diabetes. The consensus also highlighted that C‐peptide concentrations of 0.20‐0.60 nmol/L should be interpreted with caution, as no absolute value in this range is clearly discriminatory between autoimmune or monogenic diabetes, but can also be observed in people with insulin‐treated type 2 diabetes. However, guidelines for management 3 years postdiagnosis are of limited clinical value when faced with a recently diagnosed case of uncertain pathogenesis and natural history. To emphasize these uncertainties, another review considered C‐peptide estimates within 3 years postdiagnosis and used minimally different values, suggesting that insulin treatment be offered to individuals with random C‐peptide values of less than 0.30 nmol/L.

### The use of continuous glucose monitoring to diagnose stage 2 type 1 diabetes [^92f5c4bc]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2025). Medium credibility.

This consensus report evaluates the potential role of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) in screening for stage 2 type 1 diabetes (T1D). CGM offers a minimally invasive alternative to venous blood testing for detecting dysglycemia, facilitating early identification of at-risk individuals for confirmatory blood testing. A panel of experts reviewed current evidence and addressed key questions regarding CGM's diagnostic accuracy and screening protocols. They concluded that while CGM cannot yet replace blood-based diagnostics, it holds promise as a screening tool that could lead to earlier, more effective intervention. Metrics such as time above range > 140 mg/dL could indicate progression risk, and artificial intelligence (AI)-based modeling may enhance predictive capabilities. Further research is needed to establish CGM-based diagnostic criteria and refine screening strategies to improve T1D detection and intervention.

### Type 1 diabetes [^a0444308]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

Type 1 diabetes is a chronic autoimmune disease characterised by insulin deficiency and resultant hyperglycaemia. Knowledge of type 1 diabetes has rapidly increased over the past 25 years, resulting in a broad understanding about many aspects of the disease, including its genetics, epidemiology, immune and β-cell phenotypes, and disease burden. Interventions to preserve β cells have been tested, and several methods to improve clinical disease management have been assessed. However, wide gaps still exist in our understanding of type 1 diabetes and our ability to standardise clinical care and decrease disease-associated complications and burden. This Seminar gives an overview of the current understanding of the disease and potential future directions for research and care.

Implications of all the available evidence

Late-onset type 1 diabetes is difficult to diagnose in people aged 31–60 years because it represents only a small minority of patients diagnosed with diabetes; its misdiagnosis as type 2 diabetes results in inappropriate treatment. Patients with older-onset type 1 diabetes have been excluded from almost every major study of the biology of type 1 diabetes and, hence, little is known about its aetiopathology.

Biomarkers, such as C-peptide and islet-specific autoantibodies, can be used to distinguish type 1 diabetes from type 2 diabetes, but are not routinely measured or completely discriminatory. Progression to absolute insulin deficiency, defined by measurement of serum C-peptide concentration, can be used to identify type 1 diabetes, but is only useful 3–5 years after diagnosis. No studies to date have tested C-peptide in sufficiently large cohorts of patients. Autoantibodies to the islet antigen glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) have been used for diagnosis, but are only present in 70% of patients with type 1 diabetes. The low incidence (5%) of type 1 diabetes compared with type 2 diabetes in people older than 30 years means that the proportion of people who have a true-positive autoantibody test (about 3.5% of all cases) is similar to the proportion with a false-positive test (around 2.5% of all cases because the definition of antibody positive is based on a 97.5th centile cutoff for a population without diabetes). Therefore, slightly less than half of autoantibody-positive patients older than 30 years will have type 2 diabetes and not type 1 diabetes. Clinical diagnosis based on a patient's clinical features, such as age of diagnosis and BMI, does not have sufficient discriminatory power because of the low prevalence of type 1 diabetes. These difficulties in accurate diagnosis mean that, although older-onset type 1 diabetes is recognised, accurate assessment of the proportion of type 1 diabetes that occurs at older ages and identification of its clinical features is challenging.

### Diabetes mellitus: diagnosis and screening [^5f61bcf1]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Based on etiology, diabetes is classified as type 1 diabetes mellitus, type 2 diabetes mellitus, latent autoimmune diabetes, maturity-onset diabetes of youth, and miscellaneous causes. The diagnosis is based on measurement of A1C level, fasting or random blood glucose level, or oral glucose tolerance testing. Although there are conflicting guidelines, most agree that patients with hypertension or hyperlipidemia should be screened for diabetes. Diabetes risk calculators have a high negative predictive value and help define patients who are unlikely to have diabetes. Tests that may help establish the type of diabetes or the continued need for insulin include those reflective of beta cell function, such as C peptide levels, and markers of immune-mediated beta cell destruction (e.g., autoantibodies to islet cells, insulin, glutamic acid decarboxylase, tyrosine phosphatase [IA-2a and IA-2beta]). Antibody testing is limited by availability, cost, and predictive value.

6 COUNSELLING, EDUCATION AND MONITORING

The diagnosis of early‐stage type 1 diabetes must be accompanied by appropriate care. Several consensus groups have proposed guidelines, ranging from minimal care to more intensive research protocols. A practical framework for care is one that considers the likelihood of imminent progression to clinical type 1 diabetes while minimizing the intensity of testing for individuals.

Counselling and education are often underappreciated aspects of clinical care. One of the challenges we face, particularly with genetic pre‐screening, is the substantial number of individuals who require counselling after receiving information about their elevated risk for type 1 diabetes. While we acknowledge the potential negative psychosocial effects of informing families that their child may have a disease with no current symptoms, — one that may not manifest for many years — there are also clear benefits to early‐stage diagnosis. If islet autoantibody testing is done properly, the majority of those diagnosed (approximately 0.3%–0.5% of the population) will eventually develop clinical type 1 diabetes. This is not the case for genetic pre‐screening, where 10%–20% of screened individuals may be selected for follow‐up testing and informed about a risk for type 1 diabetes that is 1.5%–2.5%, leading to more widespread counselling.

### Comparison of several survey-based algorithms to ascertain type 1 diabetes among US adults with self-reported diabetes [^7dea9a36]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2020). High credibility.

While survey research presents unique challenges, defining type 1 diabetes can be challenging even with rigorous laboratory testing. A study from the SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth study found that most youth fell into the traditional categories for type 1 and type 2 diabetes (70.4%), but the etiology of the remaining participants was unknown or would warrant further testing.

A strength of this study was the use of a nationally representative sample, which allowed for generalization to the US civilian adult non-institutionalized population. In addition, there were numerous questionnaire items related to diabetes, which permitted us to analyze several different algorithms for type 1 diabetes. Limitations of this study were that all data were self-reported and type of diabetes could not be validated by medical records or laboratory measures. However, medical records may be limited in information on type of diabetes, and laboratory measures (eg, autoantibodies, C-peptide) fluctuate and may not capture occurrence during the natural history of the disease. Cognitive testing showed that respondents often had limited knowledge with respect to type of diabetes and type of glycemic medication treatment. For example, some respondents based their response to their diabetes type on sometimes inaccurate ideas they had about the different types, such as type 1 only occurring at younger ages, or that diabetes progresses in stages in a similar way to cancer (with type 2 being a more severe type of diabetes than type 1). Respondents diagnosed at young ages or those very recently diagnosed could give an exact age of diagnosis, while most of those diagnosed as adults estimated their age of diagnosis. Generally, respondents knew if they were taking diabetes medication, but some thought pills were a type of insulin. As a result, the prelude 'Insulin can be taken by shot or pump' was added to the question about insulin use. As shown throughout our results, self-reported type of diabetes alone should not be used to define type of diabetes.

The findings from this study may inform future diabetes research that uses survey data. A wide range of prevalence estimates and characteristic distributions were found according to algorithms used to define type 1 diabetes as well as potential misclassification. Using the results of this study as a foundation, future research may link survey questions to medical records, providing additional information on which algorithms perform best for classifying type 1 diabetes using survey data.

### Diabetic subjects diagnosed through the diabetes prevention trial-type 1 (DPT-1) are often asymptomatic with normal A1c at diabetes onset [^32e06943]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Laboratory tests at diagnosis

Several laboratory results were examined for those diagnosed during the study. Of the 246 people diagnosed, 177 (72.0%) had an A1C within 30 days of diagnosis, and 158 (89.3%) of these A1C tests were within 1 week of diagnosis. The mean A1C was 6.41 ± 1.15%, with 2 of 177 (1.13%) having an A1C > 10%, and 90 subjects (50.8%) had a A1C in the normal range (< 6.2%) near the time of diagnosis. The mean A1C of the group with normal A1C at onset of diabetes was 5.7% and ranged from 4.9–6.1%. A1C at diagnosis was normal for 53% percent of subjects less than 18 years of age and 39% of those greater than 18 years of age. A1C at diagnosis was compared with the last reported A1C of individuals randomized in the study but not diagnosed with diabetes. The mean A1C for this group was 5.38 ± 0.41% (P < 0.0001) compared with those diagnosed with diabetes (Fig. 1 A). ROC analysis identified an A1C of 6.05% as achieving the optimal sensitivity (53.7%) and specificity (96.7%) (Fig. 1 B).

Description

The American Diabetes Association (ADA) annually updates Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes to provide clinicians, patients, researchers, payers, and other interested parties with evidence-based recommendations for the diagnosis and management of patients with diabetes.

Methods

For the 2017 Standards of Care, the ADA Professional Practice Committee did MEDLINE searches from 1 January 2016 to November 2016 to add, clarify, or revise recommendations on the basis of new evidence. The committee rated the recommendations as A, B, or C, depending on the quality of evidence, or E for expert consensus or clinical experience. The Standards of Care were reviewed and approved by the Executive Committee of the ADA Board of Directors, which includes health care professionals, scientists, and laypersons. Feedback from the larger clinical community informed revisions.

Recommendation

This synopsis focuses on recommendations from the 2017 Standards of Care about monitoring and pharmacologic approaches to glycemic management for type 1 diabetes.

### Establishing screening programs for presymptomatic type 1 diabetes: practical guidance for diabetes care providers [^70e5e4ae]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease with two presymptomatic stages (stages 1 and 2) that precede its clinical onset (stage 3). The presymptomatic stages of T1D are characterized by circulating autoantibodies that can be reliably detected by autoantibody screening panels. Identifying people in the presymptomatic stages of T1D can allow for monitoring and prevention of diabetic ketoacidosis. A disease-modifying therapy that has been shown to delay onset of stage 3 T1D is now also available for individuals with stage 2 disease, highlighting the importance of early detection. This intervention may delay the onset of stage 3 T1D. Updated guidance and protocols are needed to integrate autoantibody screening into standard practice. This report provides guidance for endocrinology providers on establishing clinical autoantibody screening programs within their practices, institutions, healthcare networks, and/or communities. Key steps include nominating a champion for the program, building a team to implement screening, and motivating other providers to participate. Implementation of screening requires standardizing several steps in the screening process, including communicating with individuals at risk, integrating screening into existing workflows, and streamlining logistics such as ordering and coding for autoantibody panels. Providers must have a plan to interpret and communicate results and to ensure that individuals may be appropriately followed in the future. Here, common barriers to screening are addressed, and practical solutions to facilitate the adoption and success of screening initiatives are offered.

### Screening for type 1 diabetes in the general population: a status report and perspective [^3dc4a42a]. Diabetes (2022). Medium credibility.

Most screening programs to identify individuals at risk for type 1 diabetes have targeted relatives of people living with the disease to improve yield and feasibility. However, ∼90% of those who develop type 1 diabetes do not have a family history. Recent successes in disease-modifying therapies to impact the course of early-stage disease have ignited the consideration of the need for and feasibility of population screening to identify those at increased risk. Existing population screening programs rely on genetic or autoantibody screening, and these have yielded significant information about disease progression and approaches for timing for screening in clinical practice. At the March 2021 Type 1 Diabetes TrialNet Steering Committee meeting, a session was held in which ongoing efforts for screening in the general population were discussed. This report reviews the background of these efforts and the details of those programs. Additionally, we present hurdles that need to be addressed for successful implementation of population screening and provide initial recommendations for individuals with positive screens so that standardized guidelines for monitoring and follow-up can be established.

### Impact of routine clinic measurement of serum C-peptide in people with a clinician-diagnosis of type 1 diabetes [^5ae001e5]. Diabetic Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Aims/Hypothesis

The aim of this study was to determine the impact of the routine use of serum C-peptide in an out-patient clinic setting on individuals with a clinician-diagnosis of type 1 diabetes.

Methods

In this single-centre study, individuals with type 1 diabetes of at least 3 years duration were offered random serum C-peptide testing at routine clinic review. A C-peptide ≥ 200 pmol/L prompted further evaluation of the individual using a diagnostic algorithm that included measurement of islet cell antibodies and genetic testing. Where appropriate, a trial of anti-diabetic co-therapies was considered.

Results

Serum C-peptide testing was performed in 859 individuals (90% of the eligible cohort), of whom 114 (13.2%) had C-peptide ≥ 200 pmol/L. The cause of diabetes was reclassified in 58 individuals (6.8% of the tested cohort). The majority of reclassifications were to type 2 diabetes (44 individuals; 5.1%), with a smaller proportion of monogenic diabetes (14 individuals; 1.6%). Overall, 13 individuals (1.5%) successfully discontinued insulin, while a further 16 individuals (1.9%) had improved glycaemic control following the addition of co-therapies. The estimated total cost of the testing programme was £23,262 (~€26,053), that is, £27 (~€30) per individual tested. In current terms, the cost of prior insulin therapy in the individuals with monogenic diabetes who successfully stopped insulin was approximately £57,000 (~€64,000).

Conclusions/Interpretation

Serum C-peptide testing can easily be incorporated into an out-patient clinic setting and could be a cost-effective intervention. C-peptide testing should be strongly considered in individuals with a clinician-diagnosis of type 1 diabetes of at least 3 years duration.

### Diagnosis and classification of diabetes mellitus [^785b8a8d]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

On the other hand, when two different tests are available in an individual and the results are discordant, the test whose result is above the diagnostic cut point should be repeated, and the diagnosis is made on the basis of the confirmed test. That is, if a patient meets the diabetes criterion of the A1C (two results ≥ 6.5%) but not the FPG (< 126 mg/dl or 7.0 mmol/l), or vice versa, that person should be considered to have diabetes. Admittedly, in most circumstance the "nondiabetic" test is likely to be in a range very close to the threshold that defines diabetes.

Since there is preanalytic and analytic variability of all the tests, it is also possible that when a test whose result was above the diagnostic threshold is repeated, the second value will be below the diagnostic cut point. This is least likely for A1C, somewhat more likely for FPG, and most likely for the 2-h PG. Barring a laboratory error, such patients are likely to have test results near the margins of the threshold for a diagnosis. The healthcare professional might opt to follow the patient closely and repeat the testing in 3–6 months.

The decision about which test to use to assess a specific patient for diabetes should be at the discretion of the health care professional, taking into account the availability and practicality of testing an individual patient or groups of patients. Perhaps more important than which diagnostic test is used, is that the testing for diabetes be performed when indicated. There is discouraging evidence indicating that many at-risk patients still do not receive adequate testing and counseling for this increasingly common disease, or for its frequently accompanying cardiovascular risk factors. The current diagnostic criteria for diabetes are summarized in Table 3.

### How do I diagnose maturity onset diabetes of the young in my patients? [^58d2615e]. Clinical Endocrinology (2022). Medium credibility.

3 IF DIAGNOSING MODY IS IMPORTANT, WHO SHOULD I REFER FOR MODY GENETIC TESTING?

This is the most important question for clinicians diagnosing MODY in paediatric and young adult populations — how to identify patients for MODY genetic testing from the much higher background prevalence of young onset polygenic type 1 and type 2 diabetes. There are no simple clinical criteria that will accurately identify all MODY patients, and there is overlap with young onset polygenic type 1 and type 2 diabetes with regard to age of diabetes onset, BMI, history of parental diabetes, HbA1c levels and treatment. The traditional clinical diagnostic criteria for MODY (diagnosed < 25 years, not insulin treated and a parent affected with diabetes) results in a genetic diagnosis in less than half of cases. Diagnosis is further hindered by the fact that within routine diabetes care there is a lack of genetics training and awareness of MODY, with an emphasis on treatment rather than diagnosis. As a result, the majority of MODY patients go unrecognized and are managed suboptimally.

Diabetes in children is predominantly autoimmune mediated, and the most common consideration is the discrimination between type 1 diabetes and MODY. Islet autoantibodies are a highly sensitive and specific biomarker of type 1 diabetes; they are detected in ~90% of children with type 1 diabetes but are detected in only 1% with a genetic diagnosis of MODY. Systematic screening strategies for MODY in paediatric populations using antibody tests are therefore highly effective; in the ~10% of children with negative antibodies at diagnosis, approximately one in seven will have a genetic diagnosis of MODY. Positivity for a single antibody should be exclusion criteria for MODY testing. A minimum of three antibodies should be tested — GAD, IA2 and ZnT8 are preferred. IAA is not widely performed and cannot be used once insulin treatment is given, and ICA antibody testing using primate or rodent pancreatic tissue should not be performed due to a high false‐negative rate. Clinicians should seek additional antibody testing if only GAD and/or ICA are offered. Laboratories should determine the thresholds for antibody positivity based on centiles derived from nondiabetic and type 1 diabetes populations to avoid false‐positive results.

### Standards of medical care in diabetes – 2010 [^4a7837cd]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

The appropriate interval between tests is not known. The rationale for the 3-year interval is that false negatives will be repeated before substantial time elapses, and there is little likelihood that an individual will develop significant complications of diabetes within 3 years of a negative test result.

Because of the need for follow-up and discussion of abnormal results, testing should be carried out within the health care setting. Community screening outside a health care setting is not recommended because people with positive tests may not seek, or have access to, appropriate follow-up testing and care. Conversely, there may be failure to ensure appropriate repeat testing for individuals who test negative. Community screening may also be poorly targeted, i.e. it may fail to reach the groups most at risk and inappropriately test those at low risk (the worried well) or even those already diagnosed.

B. Testing for type 2 diabetes in children

The incidence of type 2 diabetes in adolescents has increased dramatically in the last decade, especially in minority populations, although the disease remains rare in the general pediatric population. Consistent with recommendations for adults, children and youth at increased risk for the presence or the development of type 2 diabetes should be tested within the health care setting. The recommendations of the ADA consensus statement on type 2 diabetes in children and youth, with some modifications, are summarized in Table 5.

Table 5
Testing for type 2 diabetes in asymptomatic children

C. Screening for type 1 diabetes

Generally, people with type 1 diabetes present with acute symptoms of diabetes and markedly elevated blood glucose levels, and most cases are diagnosed soon after the onset of hyperglycemia. However, evidence from type 1 diabetes prevention studies suggests that measurement of islet autoantibodies identifies individuals who are at risk for developing type 1 diabetes. Such testing may be appropriate in high-risk individuals, such as those with prior transient hyperglycemia or those who have relatives with type 1 diabetes, in the context of clinical research studies (see, for example). Widespread clinical testing of asymptomatic low-risk individuals cannot currently be recommended, as it would identify very few individuals in the general population who are at risk. Individuals who screen positive should be counseled about their risk of developing diabetes. Clinical studies are being conducted to test various methods of preventing type 1 diabetes or reversing early type 1 diabetes in those with evidence of autoimmunity.

### Islet autoantibodies as precision diagnostic tools to characterize heterogeneity in type 1 diabetes: a systematic review [^ae705ec0]. Communications Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Islet autoantibodies form the foundation for type 1 diabetes (T1D) diagnosis and staging, but heterogeneity exists in T1D development and presentation. We hypothesized that autoantibodies can identify heterogeneity before, at, and after T1D diagnosis, and in response to disease-modifying therapies.

Methods

We systematically reviewed PubMed and EMBASE databases (6/14/2022) assessing 10 years of original research examining relationships between autoantibodies and heterogeneity before, at, after diagnosis, and in response to disease-modifying therapies in individuals at-risk or within 1 year of T1D diagnosis. A critical appraisal checklist tool for cohort studies was modified and used for risk of bias assessment.

Results

Here we show that 152 studies that met extraction criteria most commonly characterized heterogeneity before diagnosis (91/152). Autoantibody type/target was most frequently examined, followed by autoantibody number. Recurring themes included correlations of autoantibody number, type, and titers with progression, differing phenotypes based on order of autoantibody seroconversion, and interactions with age and genetics. Only 44% specifically described autoantibody assay standardization program participation.

Conclusions

Current evidence most strongly supports the application of autoantibody features to more precisely define T1D before diagnosis. Our findings support continued use of pre-clinical staging paradigms based on autoantibody number and suggest that additional autoantibody features, particularly in relation to age and genetic risk, could offer more precise stratification. To improve reproducibility and applicability of autoantibody-based precision medicine in T1D, we propose a methods checklist for islet autoantibody-based manuscripts which includes use of precision medicine MeSH terms and participation in autoantibody standardization workshops.

Autoimmune diseases in type 1 diabetes — screening recommendations: 4.6 Screen people with type 1 diabetes for autoimmune thyroid disease soon after diagnosis and thereafter at repeated intervals if clinically indicated. 4.7 Adults with type 1 diabetes should be screened for celiac disease in the presence of gastrointestinal symptoms, signs, laboratory manifestations, or clinical suspicion suggestive of celiac disease. People with type 1 diabetes are at increased risk for other autoimmune diseases, with thyroid disease, celiac disease, and pernicious anemia (vitamin B12 deficiency) being among the most common.

### Advances in the prediction and natural history of type 1 diabetes [^a0fc6cbf]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

Type 1 diabetes (T1D) has the hallmark characteristics of autoimmunity superimposed on genetic susceptibility. Both genes (HLA) and immune markers (autoantibodies) have been validated as predictive markers of the subsequent development of the disease in higher-risk relatives and the lower-risk general population. Over the last three decades, using a combination of genes, immune, and metabolic markers, clinicians are now able to quantify an individual's disease risk from 1 in 100,000 to more than 1 in 2. This article reviews these biomarkers and T1D prediction strategies, and discusses potential implications of prediction and natural history for the pathogenesis of T1D.

### How do I diagnose maturity onset diabetes of the young in my patients? [^127d31ee]. Clinical Endocrinology (2022). Medium credibility.

Maturity Onset Diabetes of the Young (MODY) is a monogenic form of diabetes diagnosed in young individuals that lack the typical features of type 1 and type 2 diabetes. The genetic subtype of MODY determines the most effective treatment and this is the driver for MODY genetic testing in diabetes populations. Despite the obvious clinical and health economic benefits, MODY is significantly underdiagnosed with the majority of patients being inappropriately managed as having type 1 or type 2 diabetes. Low detection rates result from the difficulty in identifying patients with a likely diagnosis of MODY from the high background population of young onset type 1 and type 2 diabetes, compounded by the lack of MODY awareness and education in diabetes care physicians. MODY diagnosis can be improved through (1) access to education and training, (2) the use of sensitive and specific selection criteria based on accurate prediction models and biomarkers to identify patients for testing, (3) the development and mainstream implementation of simple criteria-based selection pathways applicable across a range of healthcare settings and ethnicities to select the most appropriate patients for genetic testing and (4) the correct use of next generation sequencing technology to provide accurate and comprehensive testing of all known MODY and monogenic diabetes genes. The creation and public sharing of educational materials, clinical and scientific best practice guidelines and genetic variants will help identify the missing patients so they can benefit from the more effective clinical care that a genetic diagnosis brings.

### Developing services to support the delivery of care to people with early-onset type 2 diabetes [^f2694a91]. Diabetic Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

6.3 A diagnostic hub service

Each locality should identify how best to deliver specialist tests (and their interpretation) to support accurate diagnoses in those with a putative diagnosis of early‐onset type 2 diabetes. Many guidelines already advocate the use of pancreatic autoantibody testing in specific populations where type 1 diabetes is suspectedand it is recognised that the use of clinical features, for example, BMI, is not adequate to segregate a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes from type 1 diabetes. Pancreatic autoantibody testing is best undertaken at diagnosis, whereas the use of C‐peptide has more value in discriminating subtypes, years after diagnosis. In line with international paediatric guidelines for youth‐onset type 2 diabetes and adult guidelines for type 1 diabetes, routine autoantibody testing in adults presenting with diabetes < 40 years is could be recommended for preventing misdiagnosis of type 1 diabetes.

Tests for type 1 diabetes and MODY genetic testing are usually routinely available, but the pathway to access these tests may not be clear at a practice level and there may be additional challenges, for example, the need to transport C‐peptide samples on ice or the need for genetic counselling. The concept of a diagnostic hub within an Integrated Care System or Primary Care Network could be a useful concept, such that general practitioners are supported to (1) determine when these tests are appropriate, (2) have a streamlined pathway for accessibility and (3) have the availability of relevant specialists, when required. A suitably qualified clinician, a diabetes consultant working in the community setting or indeed a laboratory specialist could be in a position to support this if they have relevant expertise.

6.4 Consideration of patient engagement

Consideration should be given to the development of non‐traditional ways to engage with people that have early‐onset type 2 diabetes. Several studies outline that younger people with type 1 diabetes are less likely to engage with healthcare services and there is evidence this may also apply to those with early‐onset type 2 diabetes. This may partially be related to education and employment pressures or feelings of distress around chronic disease management. Novel approaches are important to encourage participation in weight loss programmes and medication reviews. Consideration should also be given to participation in local remission programmes. Digital platforms are likely to have appeal in this younger age group both for consultation purposes but also in relation to behaviour change, however, alternatives for those with barriers to accessing digital solutions, should also be provided.

### Standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^4f9e99ca]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for diabetes mellitus type 1, more specifically with respect to screening for CVD, ADA 2025 guidelines recommend to consider obtaining screening with a natriuretic peptide (BNP or NT-proBNP) to facilitate the prevention of stage C HF in adult patients with diabetes, as they are at increased risk for the development of asymptomatic cardiac structural or functional abnormalities (stage B HF) or symptomatic (stage C) HF.
