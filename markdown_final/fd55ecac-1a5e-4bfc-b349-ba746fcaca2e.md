## Question

Lumbar radiculopathy

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about diagnosing and managing lumbar radiculopathy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the clinical diagnosis from history and examination. Then, I should verify red flags and the role of imaging. Next, I will classify severity and stage the disorder to guide conservative versus interventional or surgical choices. After that, I will map evidence-based conservative management by stage, evaluate when to consider injections, define surgical indications and expected outcomes, appraise special populations, and finally summarize cost-effectiveness and follow-up to close the loop.

> Let me first confirm the clinical diagnosis, because management hinges on correlating dermatomal/myotomal leg pain with mechanical triggers and a positive straight leg raise or femoral nerve stretch test, while also checking reflexes and strength asymmetries that align with the suspected root level; if the history and exam fit, the pretest probability is high and I can proceed confidently, but wait, let me verify that I'm not anchoring on a mimic like peripheral neuropathy or hip pathology before moving on [^116D8nb2] [^114YqKZn].

> Hold on, I should verify red flags before anything else: cauda equina, progressive motor deficit, infection, malignancy, and fracture mandate urgent imaging and surgical or oncologic pathways; MRI is preferred for emergent cases, but if MRI is contraindicated, CT myelography is an acceptable alternative, and I need to ensure that imaging is obtained promptly when these features are present [^1172qyrP] [^114ttJtW].

> Next, I should review when to image otherwise stable patients; most with uncomplicated radiculopathy do not need immediate imaging, and routine early MRI increases false positives without changing management, so I should confirm persistence beyond 4–6 weeks with failed conservative care before obtaining MRI to guide decisions, while keeping in mind that a careful history and exam raise the pretest probability and reduce false-positive imaging results when I do order it [^1172qyrP] [^116D8nb2].

> I will now classify severity to guide urgency and level of care: mild to moderate disease lacks motor deficit or red flags and is appropriate for conservative care, whereas severe disease with progressive weakness, intractable pain, or cauda equina requires urgent or emergent surgical consultation; but wait, I should double-check that "severe" truly includes objective neurologic deficit or disabling pain refractory to appropriate conservative therapy, aligning with guideline language [^1172qyrP] [^112nUiaX].

> Let me think about staging, because the optimal conservative mix varies by time course: acute (< 4 weeks) focuses on education, staying active, and NSAIDs; subacute (4–12 weeks) adds strength training and neurodynamic mobilization and considers transforaminal/epidural injections; chronic (> 12 weeks) incorporates spinal manipulative therapy, function-specific training, and vocational/ergonomic counseling; I should confirm this stage-based consensus because it directly informs referrals and modalities [^113bh6P7].

> For acute management, I should confirm that we prioritize pain education and activity rather than rest, using NSAIDs for analgesia while avoiding routine opioids, and consider short, staged physical therapy emphasizing directional preference; I need to ensure we are not inadvertently reinforcing fear-avoidance or over-medicalizing early recovery [^113bh6P7] [^114DCQ6Y].

> In the subacute phase, I should verify that core stabilization and progressive strengthening are introduced, and I must be cautious with epidural injections; evidence shows at best modest, short-term benefit and no long-term advantage over saline in chronic radiculopathy, though transforaminal routes may outperform caudal or interlaminar in the short term, so I should frame injections as a bridge during active rehabilitation rather than disease-modifying therapy [^1112ohwQ] [^114Cgqp7] [^114q3QHi].

> For chronic symptoms, I should review multimodal options: spinal manipulation can offer clinically meaningful improvements over physiotherapy alone in subacute and chronic cases, function-specific exercise and graded exposure are key, and I need to consider work-focused rehabilitation; I should confirm that expectations are set that long-term outcomes with structured conservative care can approximate surgical outcomes in many patients, albeit with slower initial relief [^115hUwke] [^113bh6P7] [^111vZKhm].

> Wait, let me verify injection decision points so I don't overuse them: after a fair trial of 6–12 weeks of conservative care with persistent severe radicular pain, a single transforaminal epidural steroid injection may provide short-term relief and facilitate participation in therapy, but I should counsel that long-term superiority over placebo is unproven and that repeated injections without functional gains are not justified; selective nerve root blocks can be both diagnostic and therapeutic in selected cases [^114q3QHi] [^117STC9L] [^113obguX].

> I need to ensure surgical indications are clear and timing is appropriate: persistent, function-limiting radiculopathy beyond roughly 6–12 weeks despite structured conservative care, progressive neurologic deficit, or cauda equina syndrome are accepted indications; hold on, I initially thought there was high-certainty evidence that early surgery improves long-term outcomes, but I should correct that — high-quality RCTs show faster short-term improvement with surgery, with convergence of outcomes by 1–2 years, so shared decision-making is essential [^115p4U5u] [^112nUiaX].

> Let me consider surgical choices and expected outcomes: standard microdiscectomy remains the reference procedure with high success and favorable cost-effectiveness profiles; sequestrectomy can be effective when appropriate, but fusion is generally not indicated for routine primary disc herniation with radiculopathy unless instability or recurrent herniation with specific risk factors is present; I should double-check that this aligns with both guideline and cost-effectiveness data [^117EdyFS] [^113qv7mK] [^116LwMUt].

> I should confirm special populations and modifiers: in workers' compensation or litigation contexts, outcomes with nonoperative care are worse and progression to surgery is more likely; older adults often improve substantially with conservative care, and given higher surgical risk, I should favor a longer conservative trial unless deficits progress; in diabetics, metformin has been associated with reduced radicular pain in retrospective cohorts, but I must not over-interpret observational data without prospective trials [^1114FL6T] [^116ZsSFX] [^111EoaUA].

> Next, I should review cost-effectiveness to inform timing and access: in chronic radiculopathy (4–12 months), early microdiscectomy is cost-effective versus 6 months of nonoperative care at commonly accepted thresholds; more broadly, microdiscectomy demonstrates favorable cost per QALY across multiple analyses, reinforcing timely surgical access for appropriately selected patients after a fair conservative trial [^117WUWkp] [^113qv7mK].

> But wait, what if the presentation is actually a mimic; I need to check for hip osteoarthritis, peripheral neuropathy, vascular claudication, and plexopathies, especially when the exam and imaging are discordant, because mislabeling as radiculopathy can derail management; a careful review of systems and targeted testing help avoid misdiagnosis [^113PT2TN].

> I should double-check the natural history so I counsel accurately: most radiculopathies improve spontaneously over weeks to months, which supports initial conservative care, yet a substantial minority have persistent symptoms beyond a year, which is why structured rehabilitation and judicious escalation are important rather than passive observation alone [^115hdpkj] [^1112ohwQ].

> Finally, I will outline follow-up cadence and metrics: reassess at 2–4 weeks to confirm trajectory, at 6–8 weeks to decide on imaging if not improving, and at 12 weeks to pivot toward injections or surgical referral if pain and function remain unacceptable; I need to ensure we track leg pain intensity, Oswestry Disability Index, straight leg raise improvement, and any neurologic change, adjusting the plan accordingly and aligning with patient preferences and occupational demands [^113bh6P7] [^112nUiaX].

Lumbar radiculopathy is best managed with a **stepwise approach** [^114DCQ6Y] [^112qiq8H]: begin with conservative care (education, activity, NSAIDs, and physical therapy) [^113bh6P7] [^114yyKtJ] for most patients; reserve **MRI** [^1172qyrP] for persistent or severe symptoms, red flags, or surgical planning; and consider **epidural steroid injections** [^117STC9L] for persistent radicular pain after 4–6 weeks [^notfound]. Surgery (microdiscectomy) is indicated for **progressive neurologic deficits, cauda equina, or refractory symptoms** after 6–12 weeks of conservative care, with faster relief but similar long-term outcomes versus nonoperative care [^115p4U5u] [^117EdyFS] [^112nUiaX]. Prognosis is favorable, with 70–90% improving within 4–12 weeks; however, recurrence is common, so patient education and activity maintenance are essential [^115hdpkj] [^116ZsSFX].

---

## Clinical presentation and diagnosis

Typical symptoms include **radiating leg pain** [^114YqKZn], sensory changes, weakness, and reflex loss in a dermatomal pattern [^114YqKZn] [^116ZsSFX]; the straight leg raise test is sensitive for L4–S1 radiculopathy [^notfound]. MRI is the **preferred imaging modality** [^111oyoPe] to confirm disc herniation and nerve root compression, with CT or CT myelography as alternatives when MRI is contraindicated [^114ttJtW]. Electrodiagnostic studies (EMG/NCS) are reserved for atypical presentations or diagnostic uncertainty [^114YqKZn].

---

## Conservative management

Conservative care is **first-line** [^113bh6P7] for most patients, with education, activity, NSAIDs, and physical therapy [^113bh6P7]; 70–90% improve within 4–12 weeks [^notfound]. Physical therapy emphasizes **mechanical diagnosis and therapy (MDT)** [^11511YKP], core stabilization, and progressive loading [^111vZKhm]; spinal manipulation may benefit acute cases [^112RqiW7] [^111uJQGi]. Epidural steroid injections provide **short-term relief** for persistent radicular pain but do not improve long-term outcomes [^117STC9L] [^114Cgqp7].

---

## Indications for surgical intervention

Surgery is indicated for:

- **Progressive neurologic deficit**: Motor weakness or reflex loss [^112qTvd9].
- **Cauda equina syndrome**: Saddle anesthesia, bladder/bowel dysfunction [^113DavSM].
- **Refractory symptoms**: Persistent pain after 6–12 weeks of conservative care [^notfound].

Microdiscectomy is the **standard procedure**, with faster symptom relief but similar long-term outcomes versus nonoperative care [^115p4U5u] [^111vZKhm].

---

## Prognosis and recurrence

Prognosis is **generally favorable**, with most patients improving within 4–12 weeks [^116ZsSFX]; however, recurrence is common (7–18%), so education and activity maintenance are important [^112qiq8H].

---

## Emerging therapies and research

Emerging options include **minimally invasive techniques**, biologics, and neuromodulation, but evidence remains limited and these are not yet standard care [^117MRDea] [^115cK5Fz].

---

Lumbar radiculopathy is common and often self-limited; a **stepwise approach** — conservative care first, then selective imaging, injections, and surgery for refractory or severe cases — balances efficacy and safety, with patient education and activity as key drivers of recovery [^114DCQ6Y] [^112qiq8H].

### Surgical management of lumbar radiculopathy: a systematic review [^115p4U5u]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Lumbar radiculopathy is characterized by radiating pain with or without motor weakness or sensory disturbances; the point prevalence ranges from 1.6 to 13.4%. The objective of this review was to determine the efficacy, safety, and cost of surgical versus nonsurgical management of symptomatic lumbar radiculopathy in adults.

Methods

We searched PubMed from January 1, 2007, to April 10, 2019 with hand searches of systematic reviews for studies prior to 2007. One reviewer extracted data and a second checked for accuracy. Two reviewers completed independent risk of bias and strength of evidence ratings.

Results

We included seven RCTs (N = 1158) and three cost-effectiveness analysis. Surgery reduced leg pain by 6 to 26 points more than nonsurgical interventions as measured on a 0- to 100-point visual analog scale of pain at up to 26 weeks follow-up; differences between groups did not persist at 1 year or later. The evidence was somewhat mixed for function and disability in follow-up through 26 weeks (standardized mean difference [SMD] -0.16 (95% CI, -0.30 to -0.03); minimal differences were observed at 2 years (SMD -0.06 (95% CI, -0.20 to 0.07). There were similar improvements in quality of life, neurologic symptoms, and return to work. No surgical deaths occurred and surgical morbidity was infrequent. The incidence of reoperations ranged from 0 to 10%. The average cost per quality-adjusted life year gained from a healthcare payor perspective ranged from $51,156 to $83,322 for surgery compared to nonsurgical interventions.

Discussion

Most findings are based on a body of RCT evidence graded as low to very low certainty. Compared with nonsurgical interventions, surgery probably reduces pain and improves function in the short- and medium-term, but this difference does not persist in the long-term. Although surgery appears to be safe, it may or may not be cost-effective depending on a decision maker's willingness to pay threshold.

### Conservative management for lumbar radiculopathy based on the stage of the disorder: a Delphi study [^113bh6P7]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Conservative management of lumbar radiculopathy (LR) is the first treatment option. To date, systematic reviews and clinical practice guidelines have not considered the most appropriate timing of management. This study aimed to establish consensus on effective conservative treatment modalities across different stages (i.e., acute, sub-acute, or chronic) of LR.

Materials and Methods

Through an iterative multistage Delphi process, experts rated agreement with proposed treatment modalities across stages of LR and could suggest additional treatment modalities. The agreement was measured using a 5-point Likert scale. Descriptive statistics were used to measure agreement (median, interquartile ranges, and percentage of agreement). Consensus criteria were defined a priori for each round.

Results

Fourteen panelists produced a consensus list of effective treatment modalities across stages of LR. Acute stage management should focus on providing patients with information about the condition including pain education, individualized physical activity, and directional preference exercises, supported with NSAIDs. In the sub-acute stage, strength training and neurodynamic mobilization could be added and transforaminal/epidural injections considered. In the chronic stage, spinal manipulative therapy, specific exercise, and function-specific physical training should be combined with individualized vocational, ergonomic and postural advice.

Conclusions

Experts agree effectiveness of interventions differs through the evolution of LR. IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATIONTo date clinical guideline for conservative management of lumbar radiculopathy do not consider the evolution of the condition. Acute stage management of lumbar radiculopathy should focus on providing information about the condition and support individualized physical activity with pain medication. Sub-acute management should add neurodynamic mobilization to strength training, while transforaminal and/or epidural injections could be considered. Chronic stage management should consider spinal manipulative therapy and focus on restoring personalized functional capacity.

### An evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy [^112X8knx]. The Spine Journal (2014). Medium credibility.

Lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy — introduction and scope state that the guideline provides evidence-based recommendations to address key clinical questions surrounding the diagnosis and treatment of lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy and was developed as an educational tool to assist practitioners who treat these patients. The patient population encompasses adults (18 years or older) with a chief complaint of leg pain, numbness or weakness in a dermatomal or myotomal distribution as a result of a primary lumbar disc herniation. The document clarifies that it does not represent a "standard of care", is not a fixed treatment protocol, should not be seen as prescribing the type, frequency or duration of intervention, and should not be used as the sole reason for denial of treatment and services.

### Spinal manipulation or mobilization for radiculopathy: a systematic review [^112RqiW7]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

In this systematic review, we present a comprehensive and up-to-date systematic review of the literature as it relates to the efficacy and effectiveness of spinal manipulation or mobilization in the management of cervical, thoracic, and lumbar-related extremity pain. There is moderate quality evidence that spinal manipulation is effective for the treatment of acute lumbar radiculopathy. The quality of evidence for chronic lumbar spine-related extremity symptoms and cervical spine-related extremity symptoms of any duration is low or very low. At present, no evidence exists for the treatment of thoracic radiculopathy. Future high-quality studies should address these conditions.

Lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy — future research needs for physical therapy/structured exercise emphasize trial design. An RCT with long-term follow-up and validated outcome measures would assist in providing adequate evidence to assess the efficacy of physical therapy/structured exercise, and when ethically possible, this would be compared to an untreated control group or other active treatment groups as a comparative group; the physical therapy/structured exercise program should be standardized.

Lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy — comparative outcomes of surgery versus manipulation and research needs are noted: Manipulation "responded as well to treatment as surgically treated patients at 12 weeks", yet "because of the small sample size, along with the significant crossover and lack of a metaanalysis, this potential Level I study provides Level II therapeutic evidence that short-term outcomes in patients with lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy may be superior in surgically treated patients compared to patients treated with manipulation". For future research, "in the absence of clinical equipoise, it is impractical to demand additional randomized controlled trials comparing surgical intervention to 'usual nonoperative care'. Randomized controlled trials focusing on specific alternative treatments may be useful to identify effective alternatives to surgical intervention".

### National clinical guidelines for non-surgical treatment of patients with recent onset low back pain or lumbar radiculopathy [^112qiq8H]. European Spine Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

To summarise recommendations about 20 non-surgical interventions for recent onset (< 12 weeks) non-specific low back pain (LBP) and lumbar radiculopathy (LR) based on two guidelines from the Danish Health Authority.

Methods

Two multidisciplinary working groups formulated recommendations based on the GRADE approach.

Results

Sixteen recommendations were based on evidence, and four on consensus. Management of LBP and LR should include information about prognosis, warning signs, and advise to remain active. If treatment is needed, the guidelines suggest using patient education, different types of supervised exercise, and manual therapy. The guidelines recommend against acupuncture, routine use of imaging, targeted treatment, extraforaminal glucocorticoid injection, paracetamol, NSAIDs, and opioids.

Conclusion

Recommendations are based on low to moderate quality evidence or on consensus, but are well aligned with recommendations from international guidelines. The guideline working groups recommend that research efforts in relation to all aspects of management of LBP and LR be intensified.

### Microdiscectomy is more cost-effective than a 6-month nonsurgical care regimen for chronic radiculopathy [^117WUWkp]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

A recent randomized controlled trial (RCT), performed by the authors, comparing early surgical microdiscectomy with 6 months of nonoperative care for chronic lumbar radiculopathy showed that early surgery resulted in improved outcomes. However, estimates of the incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR), which is often expressed as the cost of gaining one quality-adjusted life year (QALY), of microdiscectomy versus nonsurgical management have varied. Radiculopathy lasting more than 4 months is less likely to improve without surgical intervention and may have a more favorable ICUR than previously reported for acute radiculopathy.

Question/Purpose

In the setting of chronic radiculopathy caused by lumbar disc herniation, defined as symptoms and/or signs of 4 to 12 months duration, is surgical management more cost-effective than 6 months of nonoperative care from the third-party payer perspective based on a willingness to pay of less than CAD 50,000/QALY?

Methods

A decision analysis model served as the vehicle for the cost-utility analysis. A decision tree was parameterized using data from our single-center RCT that was augmented with institutional microcost data from the Ontario Case Costing Initiative. Bottom-up case costing methodology generates more accurate cost estimates, although institutional costs are known to vary. There were no major surgical cost drivers such as implants or bone graft substitutes, and therefore, the jurisdictional variance would be minimal for tertiary care centers. QALYs derived from the EuroQoL-5D were the health outcome and were derived exclusively from the RCT data, given the paucity of studies evaluating the surgical treatment of lumbar radiculopathy lasting 4 to 12 months. Cost-effectiveness was assessed using the ICUR and a threshold of willingness to pay CAD 50,000 (USD 41,220) per QALY in the base case. Sensitivity analyses were performed to account for the uncertainties within the estimate of cost utility, using both a probabilistic sensitivity analysis and two one-way sensitivity analyses with varying crossover rates after the 6-month nonsurgical treatment had concluded.

Results

Early surgical treatment of patients with chronic lumbar radiculopathy (defined as symptoms of 4 to 12 months duration) was cost-effective, in that the cost of one QALY was lower than the CAD 50,000 threshold (note: the purchasing power parity conversion factor between the Canadian dollar (CAD) and the US dollar (USD) for 2019 was 1 USD = 1.213 CAD; therefore, our threshold was USD 41,220). Patients in the early surgical treatment group had higher expected costs (CAD 4118 [95% CI 3429 to 4867]) than those with nonsurgical treatment (CAD 2377 [95% CI 1622 to 3518]), but they had better expected health outcomes (1.48 QALYs [95% CI 1.39 to 1.57] versus 1.30 [95% CI 1.22 to 1.37]). The ICUR was CAD 5822 per QALY gained (95% CI 3029 to 30,461). The 2-year probabilistic sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the likelihood that early surgical treatment was cost-effective was 0.99 at the willingness-to-pay threshold, as did the one-way sensitivity analyses.

Conclusion

Early surgery is cost-effective compared with nonoperative care in patients who have had chronic sciatica for 4 to 12 months. Decision-makers should ensure adequate funding to allow timely access to surgical care given that it is highly likely that early surgical intervention is potentially cost-effective in single-payer systems. Future work should focus on both the clinical effectiveness of the treatment of chronic radiculopathy and the costs of these treatments from a societal perspective to account for occupational absences and lost patient productivity. Parallel cost-utility analyses are critical so that appropriate decisions about resource allocation can be made.

Despite its classic clinical presentation, and even when confirmed by compatible imaging findings of a herniated disc, the radiculopathy diagnosis provides only limited assistance for making decisions about treatment. The 2003 Medicare data revealed an eightfold variation in the rates of lumbar laminectomy and discectomy across geographic regions. In an effort to address this uncertainty in care, this article describes the management paradigm known as Mechanical Diagnosis and Therapy and its usefulness in decision-making for patients with lumbar radiculopathies, and reviews the relevant literature.

### Conservative management of lumbar disc herniation with associated radiculopathy: a systematic review [^111vZKhm]. Spine (2010). Low credibility.

Study Design

A systematic review of randomized controlled trials.

Objective

To determine the efficacy and adverse effects of conservative treatments for people who have lumbar disc herniation with associated radiculopathy (LDHR).

Summary Of Background Data

Although conservative management is commonly used for people who have LDHR, the efficacy and adverse effects of conservative treatments for this condition are unclear.

Methods

We searched 10 computer databases for trials published in English between 1971 and 2008. Trials focusing on people with referred leg symptoms and radiologic confirmation of a lumbar disc herniation were included if at least 1 group received a conservative and noninjection treatment.

Results

Eighteen trials involving 1671 participants were included. Seven (39%) trials were considered of high quality. Meta-analysis on 2 high-quality trials revealed that advice is less effective than microdiscectomy surgery at short-term follow-up, but equally effective at long-term follow-up. Individual high-quality trials provided moderate evidence that stabilization exercises are more effective than no treatment, that manipulation is more effective than sham manipulation for people with acute symptoms and an intact anulus, and that no difference exists among traction, laser, and ultrasound. One trial showed some additional benefit from adding mechanical traction to medication and electrotherapy methods. Adverse events were associated with traction (pain, anxiety, lower limb weakness, and fainting) and ibuprofen (gastrointestinal events).

Conclusion

Advice is less effective than microdiscectomy in the short term but equally effective in the long term for people who have LDHR. Moderate evidence favors stabilization exercises over no treatment, manipulation over sham manipulation, and the addition of mechanical traction to medication and electrotherapy. There was no difference among traction, laser, and ultrasound. Adverse events were associated with traction and ibuprofen. Additional high-quality trials would allow firmer conclusions regarding adverse effects and efficacy.

### The use of metformin is associated with decreased lumbar radiculopathy pain [^111EoaUA]. Journal of Pain Research (2013). Low credibility.

Lumbar radiculopathy pain represents a major public health problem, with few effective long-term treatments. Preclinical neuropathic and postsurgical pain studies implicate the kinase adenosine monophosphate activated kinase (AMPK) as a potential pharmacological target for the treatment of chronic pain conditions. Metformin, which acts via AMPK, is a safe and clinically available drug used in the treatment of diabetes. Despite the strong preclinical rationale, the utility of metformin as a potential pain therapeutic has not yet been studied in humans. Our objective was to assess whether metformin is associated with decreased lumbar radiculopathy pain, in a retrospective chart review. We completed a retrospective chart review of patients who sought care from a university pain specialist for lumbar radiculopathy between 2008 and 2011. Patients on metformin at the time of visit to a university pain specialist were compared with patients who were not on metformin. We compared the pain outcomes in 46 patients on metformin and 94 patients not taking metformin therapy. The major finding was that metformin use was associated with a decrease in the mean of "pain now", by -1.85 (confidence interval: -3.6 to -0.08) on a 0–10 visual analog scale, using a matched propensity scoring analysis and confirmed using a Bayesian analysis, with a significant mean decrease of -1.36 (credible interval: -2.6 to -0.03). Additionally, patients on metformin showed a non-statistically significant trend toward decreased pain on a variety of other pain descriptors. Our proof-of-concept findings suggest that metformin use is associated with a decrease in lumbar radiculopathy pain, providing a rational for larger retrospective trials in different pain populations and for prospective trials, to test the effectiveness of metformin in reducing neuropathic pain.

### Surgical treatment and outcomes of lumbar radiculopathy [^113DavSM]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Lumbar disk herniation is a significant cause of lumbar radiculopathy and results in billions of dollars in health care expenditure. Herniated lumbar disks cause mechanical and chemical irritation of the nerve roots leading to complaints of sciatica. Surgeons have several surgical options when approaching herniated disks, including various microsurgical procedures. The 3 most prominent studies to date on surgical and nonsurgical management of herniated disks agree on the efficacy of surgery over medical management in the short term but have some discrepancies when looking at long-term results. Cauda equina syndrome is a variation of lumbar disk herniation in which patients experience a combination of saddle anesthesia, abnormal lower extremity reflexes, and neurogenic bowel or bladder symptoms.

### The use of metformin is associated with decreased lumbar radiculopathy pain [^112RHz4B]. Journal of Pain Research (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Lumbar radiculopathy pain is one of the most common forms of chronic pain in developed nations and is challenging to treat with existing therapeutics. Many drugs are prescribed as treatment, but few have been shown to be effective in retrospective or prospective trials. Commonly prescribed drugs for this condition include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), opiates, anticonvulsants, antidepressants, benzodiazepines, corticosteroids, muscle relaxants, and transdermal anesthetics. The majority of patients with this condition are seen by primary care doctors, with only a small percentage referred to see a pain specialist. Lumbar radiculopathy pain can be disabling, negatively affecting a patient's ability to function and altering his or her quality of life. Only one in four patients with neuropathic pain as a result of lumbar radiculopathy receives a 50% relief from pain, indicating there is a great need for more effective therapies for this and similar conditions.

The oral biguanide metformin has been widely used for the treatment of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes for several decades. It is an orally available drug with a long history of safe use in a diverse patient population, now estimated to reach at least the tens of millions. It is known to suppress hepatic gluconeogenesis and increase insulin sensitivity. More recently, metformin's mechanism of action was found to involve the activation of adenosine monophosphate activated protein kinase (AMPK). Metformin regulates AMPK via inhibition of mitochondrial complex I, and its effects on AMPK are thought to be crucial for its beneficial effects on metabolism, although recently, a novel mechanism of action for metformin has been proposed, involving the inhibition of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) accumulation in adipocytes. An end result of AMPK activation by metformin is the inhibition of cellular anabolic processes, including the inhibition of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. AMPK can also be regulated by more potent and specific experimental tools, such as 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide (AICAR) and A769662. These drugs have been shown to mimic the effects of metformin in laboratory animals, further suggesting that the clinical effects of metformin are mediated by AMPK activation.

### Nonoperative treatment for lumbosacral radiculopathy: what factors predict treatment failure? [^1114FL6T]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Prior studies of nonoperative treatment for lumbosacral radiculopathy have identified potential predictors of treatment failure, defined by persistent pain, persistent disability, lack of recovery, or subsequent surgery. However, few predictors have been replicated, with the exception of higher leg pain intensity, as a predictor of subsequent surgery.

Questions/Purposes

We asked two research questions: (1) Does higher baseline leg pain intensity predict subsequent lumbar surgery? (2) Can other previously identified "candidate" predictors of nonoperative treatment failure be replicated?

Methods

Between January 2008 and March 2009, 154 participants with acute lumbosacral radicular pain were enrolled in a prospective database; 128 participants (83%) received nonoperative treatment and 26 (17%) received surgery over 2-year followup. Ninety-four nonoperative participants (73%) responded to followup questionnaires. We examined associations between previously identified "candidate" predictors and treatment failure defined as (1) subsequent surgery; (2) persistent leg pain on a visual analog scale; (3) persistent disability on the Oswestry Disability Index; or (4) participant-reported lack of recovery over 2-year followup. Confounding variables including sociodemographics, clinical factors, and imaging characteristics were evaluated using an exploratory bivariate analysis followed by a multivariate analysis.

Results

With the numbers available, higher baseline leg pain intensity was not an independent predictor of subsequent surgery (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.22 per point of baseline leg pain; 95% confidence interval, 0.98–1.53; p = 0.08). Prior low back pain (aOR, 4.79; 95% CI, 1.01–22.7; p = 0.05) and a positive straight leg raise test (aOR, 4.38; 95% CI, 1.60–11.9; p = 0.004) predicted subsequent surgery. Workers compensation claims predicted persistent leg pain (aOR, 9.04; 95% CI, 1.01–81; p = 0.05) and disability (aOR, 5.99; 95% CI, 1.09–32.7; p = 0.04). Female sex predicted persistent disability (aOR, 3.16; 95% CI, 1.03–9.69; p = 0.05) and perceived lack of recovery (aOR, 2.44; 95% CI, 1.02–5.84; p = 0.05).

Conclusions

Higher baseline leg pain intensity was not confirmed as a predictor of subsequent surgery. However, the directionality of the association seen was consistent with prior reports, suggesting Type II error as a possible explanation; larger studies are needed to further examine this relationship. Clinicians should be aware of potential factors that may predict nonoperative treatment failure, including prior low back pain or a positive straight leg raise test as predictors of subsequent surgery, workers compensation claims as predictors of persistent leg pain and disability, and female sex as a predictor of persistent disability and lack of recovery.

### ACR appropriateness criteria low back Pain [^1172qyrP]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

Most patients presenting with uncomplicated acute low back pain (LBP) and/or radiculopathy do not require imaging. Imaging is considered in those patients who have had up to 6 weeks of medical management and physical therapy that resulted in little or no improvement in their back pain. It is also considered for those patients presenting with red flags raising suspicion for serious underlying conditions, such as cauda equina syndrome, malignancy, fracture, and infection. Many imaging modalities are available to clinicians and radiologists for evaluating LBP. Application of these modalities depends largely on the working diagnosis, the urgency of the clinical problem, and comorbidities of the patient. When there is concern for fracture of the lumbar spine, multidetector CT is recommended. Those deemed to be interventional candidates, with LBP lasting for > 6 weeks having completed conservative management with persistent radiculopathic symptoms, may seek MRI. Patients with severe or progressive neurologic deficit on presentation and red flags should be evaluated with MRI. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (the RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances in which evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Natural history of radiculopathy [^115hdpkj]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Radicular pain is a frequent complaint of patients presenting to outpatient primary care and musculoskeletal clinics. Most cases of radiculopathy are self-limiting, and symptoms resolve over the course of weeks to months. There is spontaneous resolution of disc herniations, and clinical improvement correlates with morphologic resolution. Knowledge of the natural history of radiculopathy is crucial for the health care provider to appropriately counsel and treat patients with this disorder. Although each patient should be managed individually, the favorable prognosis of radiculopathy based on the natural history supports a conservative approach for the initial weeks to months for most patients.

### Anti-tumor necrosis factor antagonists in the treatment of low back pain and radiculopathy: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115cK5Fz]. Pain Physician (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Low back pain, with or without radiculopathy, is an important cause of disability and economic expenditure. However, many patients are not achieving optimal pain control with existing medications. Tumor necrosis factor antagonists (anti-TNFα) could be an alternative drug treatment.

Objectives

Systematic review the efficacy and safety of anti-TNFα in the treatment of low back pain with or without radiculopathy.

Study Design

Inclusion criteria were observational studies with safety as an outcome, and randomized or nonrandomized controlled trial (RCT) studies on efficacy and/or safety of anti-TNFα drugs on low back pain. Exclusion criteria included patients with auto-immune conditions or osteoporosis.

Results

Studies were assessed independently by 2 authors regarding inclusion/exclusion criteria, risk of bias, clinical relevance, quality, and strength of evidence (GRADE approach). Of the 1,179 studies retrieved, all duplicates were excluded and then the inclusion/exclusion criteria was applied. One observational study (n = 143) and 11 RCTs remained (n = 539): 8 for etanercept (n = 304), one for adalimumab (n = 61), one for adalimumab and etanercept (n = 60), one for infliximab (n = 40) and one for REN-1654 (n = 74). Only 3 etanercept and 2 adalimumab studies showed statistically significant pain relief when compared to placebo. There was no difference in the overall incidence of adverse effects when comparing anti-TNF-α and placebo.

Limitations

Despite the statistically significant effect, this meta-analysis has important limitations, such as high heterogeneity and high use of outcome imputation.

Conclusions

There is low evidence that epidural etanercept has a low-to-moderate effect size when compared to placebo for pain due to discogenic lumbar radiculopathy (5 studies, n = 185), with a standardized mean difference = -0.43 (95% confidence interval [CI] -0.84 to -0.02). There is moderate evidence that epidural etanercept does not have a higher adverse effects incidence rate when compared to placebo for discogenic lumbar radiculopathy (5 studies, n = 185) with a relative risk (RR) = 0.84 (95% CI 0.53 to 1.34). There is moderate evidence that anti-TNFα does not have a higher adverse effects incidence rate when compared to placebo for low back pain (10 studies, n = 343) with an RR = 0.93 (95% CI 0.56 to 1.55). We strongly suggest that anti-TNFα continue to be studied in experimental settings for the treatment of low back pain. We cannot currently recommend this therapy in clinical practice. New research could shed some light on the efficacy of anti-TNFα and change this recommendation in the future.

### An evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy [^114q3QHi]. The Spine Journal (2014). Medium credibility.

Lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy — epidural steroid injection approach (interlaminar, transforaminal, caudal) has insufficient evidence for a recommendation, with the guideline stating there is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against the effectiveness of one injection approach over another and grading this as I (Insufficient Evidence). In a randomized controlled trial of 90 patients with 30 per group, outcomes at 24 weeks showed the transforaminal group had significantly more patients reporting complete (30%) or partial relief (53%), with complete or partial pain relief reported in 25, 18 and 17 patients in the transforaminal, interlaminar and caudal groups, respectively, and no differences between groups in depression and functional outcomes; patients had an average of 1.5, 2.2 and 2.5 injections in the transforaminal, interlaminar and caudal groups. This study provides Level I therapeutic evidence that transforaminal injections are more effective than caudal or interlaminar injections. Another randomized trial comparing nerve root sheath versus interspinous glucocorticoid injection included 30 patients (17 vs 13), assessed outcomes at 28 days and again at a mean of eight months, found improvement in both groups with no significant difference, and at the eight-month follow-up three patients in each group had surgery and the remaining patients were pain free.

### Effect of caudal epidural steroid or saline injection in chronic lumbar radiculopathy: multicentre, blinded, randomised controlled trial [^1112ohwQ]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Chronic lumbar radiculopathy is defined as a clinical syndrome of back and leg pain accompanied by sensory, reflex, or motor deficits in a nerve root distribution lasting for more than 12 weeks. The lifetime prevalence of lumbar radiculopathy has been reported to be 5.3% in men and 3.7% in women. Lumbar radiculopathy due to a prolapsed disc resolves spontaneously in 23–48% of patients, but up to 30% will still have pronounced symptoms after one year, 20% will be out of work, and 5–15% will undergo surgery.

Epidural steroid injections for lumbar radiculopathy have been used since 1953. Along with mechanical compression of nerve roots, lumbar radiculopathy can be triggered by different proinflammatory chemical agents, causing ectopic neuron firing. Steroids injected into the epidural space or around the affected nerve root are thought to inhibit these inflammatory mediators. However, there is conflicting evidence for a potential benefit of epidural steroid injections. Some studies have shown a moderate short term benefit, whereas others have shown little difference between epidural steroid and placebo injections. Studies comparing epidural steroid injections with epidural saline or local anaesthetic injections have shown less benefit from steroidsthan those comparing epidural steroid injections with sham or soft tissue injections. Furthermore, recent studies have concluded that epidural local anaesthetic or saline alone could have a positive effect by itself.

At the one year follow-up after epidural steroid injection, improvement of pain and disability has been reported for 36% to 43% of the patients. However, this outcome does not differ greatly from the natural history of the disease. The true effect of epidural steroid injections might be to reduce radicular pain before natural recovery occurs. Despite the lack of evidence for long term efficacy, the use of epidural steroid injection in the United States increased from 553 to 2055 per 100 000 patients from 1994 to 2001. In the United Kingdom, epidural steroid injection for lumbar radiculopathy was one of the most common therapeutic spine injection procedures in 2002–03.

We aimed to assess the effects of caudal epidural steroid and saline injections compared with subcutaneous sham injections in patients with chronic radiculopathy, by measuring improvements in physical function, health related quality of life, and pain at short term (6 weeks), intermediate term (12 weeks), and long term (52 weeks) follow-up.

### Surgical management of cervical and lumbosacral radiculopathies: indications and outcomes [^117MRDea]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

The most common indication for the surgical management of compressive cervical and lumbar radiculopathies is a herniated disc in a patient who has not improved with conservative management. Even though a herniated disk is a common condition, it is paramount that the examining physician considers an extensive differential diagnosis when evaluating radiculopathies, especially in patients with a history of cancer, multiple medical illnesses, secondary gain, or advanced age. This consideration has become even more important as imaging studies have improved, because previously undetected degenerative changes are now clearly visualized on MRI and CT scans. These improved studies, however, do not replace a thorough history and physical examination, because a patient's signs and symptoms may not correlate with the radiographic findings. The authors have presented a series of surgical techniques used to manage cervical and lumbar discectomies to the most recent "minimally invasive" percutaneous techniques. Much debate and controversy surround these more recent techniques. There is no controversy, however, in stating that achieving good outcomes, regardless of technique, is predicated on proper patient selection. Because patient selection is the most important predictor of outcome and because serious complications have been reported with "minimally invasive" percutaneous procedures, the authors continue to advocate the proven traditional surgical approaches until prospective, randomized studies demonstrate a clear benefit to using alternative techniques.

Lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy — cost-effectiveness of surgical options is supported, with microdiscectomy showing favorable value across multiple analyses; the committee "felt that there was strong and consistent evidence supporting the cost effectiveness of microdiscectomy for patients with symptomatic lumbar disc herniation who desired surgical treatment". In the SPORT cohort, Tosteson et al evaluated outcomes "at two and four years", finding that "at two years, lumbar discectomy compared to nonsurgical management was felt to be cost effective with a cost per QALY of between $35,000 and $70,000 depending upon the payer", and with continued follow-up "the cost per QALY of surgical intervention dropped to approximately $20,000 per QALY". In a prospective registry of "1822 workers", Hansson et al "estimated the cost per QALY of surgical intervention to be $4,648.00 and reported that surgical treatment had better cost utility than nonsurgical treatment". Malter et al reported that microdiscectomy was cost effective "with an estimated cost per QALY of $12,000–$30,000 depending upon the payer".

### Transforaminal injection of corticosteroids for lumbar radiculopathy: systematic review and meta-analysis [^117STC9L]. European Spine Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Transforaminal epidural injection of steroids is used to treat lumbar radicular pain. However, there are only a few well-designed randomized, controlled studies on the effectiveness of steroid injection.

Study Design

Hence, this study aims to assess the effectiveness of steroid injection to treat lumbar radicular pain using a meta-analysis of transforaminal epidural injection therapy for low back and lumbar radicular pain. The comparison was based on the mean difference in the Visual Analogue Score (VAS) and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) from baseline to the specified followed up.

Methods

The available literature of lumbar transforaminal epidural injections in managing low back and radicular pain was reviewed. Data sources included relevant literature of the English language identified through searches of PubMed and EMBASE from 1966 to 2009, and manual searches of the bibliographies of known primary and review articles. Finally, the search included the Current Controlled Trials Register and the Cochrane Database of Controlled Trials.

Results

The initial search identified 126 papers. After screening, five randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were studied for analysis and only three of these had followed-up patients systematically with pain and disability outcome scores to 3 months and of these, only one had follow up to 12 months. A total of 187 patients ('treatment group' receiving local anaesthetic/steroid injection) were compared with 181 patients ('control' group, receiving local anaesthetic only or saline injection). Improvement in pain (standardised mean difference in VAS 0.2 in favour of 'treatment'; 95%CI: -0.41 to 0.00, p = 0.05, I² 0%) but not disability (standardised mean difference in ODI 0; 95%CI: -0.21 to 0.20, p = 0.99, I² 0%) was observed between 'treatment' and 'control' groups; these differences were not significant. Additionally, the one study following patients to 12 months did not find any significant difference in VAS and ODI between treatment and control groups.

Conclusion

The current meta-analysis shows that transforaminal epidural steroid injections, when appropriately performed, should result in an improvement in pain, but not disability. The three RCTs that followed patients to 3 months (and the single study to 12 months) have found no benefit by the addition of steroids. The limitations of this study include the paucity of the available literature.

### An evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy [^116D8nb2]. The Spine Journal (2014). Medium credibility.

Lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy — diagnosis and imaging emphasizes core test accuracy concepts and appropriate use of imaging relative to clinical assessment. With tests that have a high sensitivity, a negative test effectively rules out the disease, and with tests that have a high specificity, a positive test effectively rules in the disease; additionally, the performance of a test depends on positive and negative predictive value, which depends directly on the prevalence of disease in the tested population. One of the purposes of a history and physical examination is to increase the prevalence of disease in patients seen for advanced diagnostic imaging/testing or offered surgery, and the review attempted to identify those symptoms or findings which have a high likelihood ratio for lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy. Cross-sectional imaging exams have a low intrinsic specificity with significant pathologic findings in asymptomatic populations, so results of any cross-sectional examination need to be closely correlated with the clinical examination. Direct visualization of intrinsic neurologic processes and neural impingement is noted as important in determining the etiology of radicular symptoms. Although the gold standard in the diagnosis of lumbar disc herniation is surgery, when assessing the validity of subjective complaints or physical examination findings, use of cross-sectional imaging as a gold standard may be considered an acceptable substitute, though the validity of surgery as a gold standard can be questioned as findings at surgery can be subjective. Additional sufficiently-powered observational studies of history/physical examination findings and diagnostic tests are needed to determine their value in influencing treatment assignment and outcome in patients with lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy.

Lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy — gabapentin: There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against the use of gabapentin in the treatment of lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy (Grade of Recommendation: I (Insufficient Evidence)). In a prospective case series, of the 78 patients included, 33 had lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy; patients received a titration of gabapentin three times daily to a maximum dose of 2400 mg/day, and outcomes at three months showed statistically significant improvements in VAS radicular pain, walking distance and Odom's criteria, with walking distance improving from 0–100 m in 29 patients to 1000 m in 24 patients and Odom's criteria good or excellent in 28 patients. This study provides Level IV therapeutic evidence that gabapentin three times daily titrated to a maximum dose of 2400 mg/day can significantly reduce radicular pain and improve function.

Lumbar intervertebral disc herniation — prospective comparative study found 743 patients were included, with 528 patients in the surgically treated group and 191 patients in the medical/interventional group; outcomes were assessed for up to two years and at three months the surgical group had statistically significant improvement in bodily pain, physical function and Oswestry Disability Index that narrowed at two years but remained statistically significant. Those who chose operative intervention reported greater improvements and the effects of surgery persisted at two-year follow-up; this study provides Level II therapeutic evidence that surgical treatment may result in earlier and greater improvement of symptoms compared to medical/interventional treatment.

### Positive medium-term influence of multimodal pain management on socioeconomic factors and health care utilization in patients with lumbar radiculopathy: a prospective study [^115u17dd]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Low back pain (LBP) is one of the most disabling health conditions in the world. In 10–20% of patients, LBP is associated with lumbar radiculopathy. Back pain is one of the most important causes of lifelong disability worldwide and results in enormous medical and social costs. Although all age groups are affected, elderly people are the largest population presenting with lumbar spine diseases. Irrespective of the type of health system, the growing number of people with back pain also presents a socioeconomic problem. The longer the patients are unable to work, the higher is the number of patient visits to a physician. The lower the number of effective treatment options available, the higher are the costs for public health systems. Therefore, it is very important to find the right treatment as quickly as possible to prevent pain chronificationand to avoid surgery if possible. Although comparing treatment options is difficult because of the lack of standardization, we could show the positive mid-term effect of an injection-based multimodal pain management (MPM) concept in patients with lumbar radiculopathy in a previously published study.

At the same time, concerns have been expressed in the media as well as in clinical studies with regard to the efficacy, cost, and overuse of low back injections.–Although evidence indicates that LBP injections for radiculopathy may delay more expensive surgical interventions and decrease the use of opiods, more and more health care providers and insurances try to avoid MPM as an inpatient option to save costs in the short term. In Germany, for example, patients have to fulfill 3 out of 5 criteria to be eligible for inpatient MPM; otherwise, treatment will not be paid for (Table 1).

Because of these contradictory facts and the positive mid-term results regarding clinical outcome shown by our group, this further investigation of our cohort aimed at showing the positive mid-term effects of a multimodal inpatient therapeutic concept on socioeconomic factors and health care utilization in patients with lumbar radiculopathy.

### The efficacy of therapeutic selective nerve block in treating lumbar radiculopathy and avoiding surgery [^113obguX]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Most patients with Lumbar radiculopathy usually improve on conservative treatment, considering that there are no red flags for urgent surgery. In intractable cases in which pain is persistent and fails to respond to any treatment, surgery is advised. One of the most common types of surgery is microdiscectomy, which is the surgical removal of part of the disc, performed with the use of an operating microscope or other magnifying tools. Other minimally invasive surgical techniques, such as endoscopic surgery, have recently been developed and are being a standard practice in many centers. Although there is evidence that early surgery in patients with sciatica provides for better short-term relief of back pain as compared to prolonged conservative care, the evidence is low quality, and no significant differences were found between surgery and usual conservative care in any of the clinical outcomes after 1 and 2 years.

Back surgery with little success is associated with significant healthcare costs and risks to patients. Many patients hesitate to undergo surgery or have a high risk for general anesthesia. The long waiting list for surgery remains an obstacle in many countries and centers, and it may take weeks or even months. For non-insured patients, the cost of surgery is another issue. In our institution, the average waiting time for a microdiscectomy is 2–3 months, and the average cost for non-insured patients is 3000 U.S. Dollars. Searching for a fast and reasonable alternative for such patients is necessary.

As a quick intervention that does not necessitate general anesthesia, SNRB can be used as a therapeutic procedure and a diagnostic procedure useful for selecting pain-mediating nerve roots. Its effect as a therapeutic procedure is unpredictable, mostly short-acting in most patients, and recurrences are expected. Still, it can create a time window for pain relief. Although long-lasting improvement is possible, the long-term effects of the medications cannot be predicted. Usually, the immediate effect is from the local anesthetic injected; this wears off in a few hours. The steroid starts working in about 2–3 days, and its effect can last for several days to a few months. However, it remains a good, fast, and less expensive alternative to surgery.

### Epidural steroids in the management of chronic spinal pain and radiculopathy [^117PxM8D]. Pain Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Epidural injections with or without steroids are used extensively in the management of chronic spinal pain. However, evidence is contradictory with continuing debate about the value of epidural steroid injections in chronic spinal syndromes. The objective of this systematic review is to determine the effectiveness of epidural injections in the treatment of chronic spinal pain. Data sources include relevant literature identified through searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE (Jan 1966- Mar 2003), manual searches of bibliographies of known primary and review articles, and abstracts from scientific meetings. Both randomized and non-randomized studies were included in the review based on the criteria established by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ). Studies were excluded from the analysis if they were simply review or descriptive and failed to meet minimum criteria. The results showed that there was strong evidence to indicate effectiveness of transforaminal epidural injections in managing lumbar nerve root pain. Further, evidence was moderate for caudal epidural injections in managing lumbar radicular pain. The evidence in management of chronic neck pain, chronic low back pain, cervical radiculopathy, spinal stenosis, and post laminectomy syndrome was limited or inconclusive. In conclusion, the evidence of effectiveness of transforaminal epidural injections in managing lumbar nerve root pain was strong, whereas, effectiveness of caudal epidural injections in managing lumbar radiculopathy was moderate, while there was limited or inconclusive evidence of effectiveness of epidural injections in managing chronic spinal pain without radiculopathy, spinal stenosis, post lumbar laminectomy syndrome, and cervical radiculopathy.

### Spinal manipulation for subacute and chronic lumbar radiculopathy: a randomized controlled trial [^115hUwke]. The American Journal of Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

We evaluated the efficacy of spinal manipulation for the management of nonacute lumbar radiculopathy.

Methods

In a university hospital we performed a randomized controlled trial with 2 parallel arms. Patients (n = 44) with unilateral radicular low back pain lasting more than 4 weeks were randomly allocated to manipulation and control groups. The primary outcome was the intensity of the low back pain on a visual analog scale. The secondary outcome was the Oswestry Disability Questionnaire score. We also measured spinal ranges of motion. The assessments were carried out at the baseline, immediately after intervention, and at 3 months' follow-up. All patients underwent physiotherapy. The manipulation group received three sessions of manipulation therapy 1 week apart. For manipulation, we used Robert Maigne's technique.

Results

Both groups experienced a decrease in back and leg pain significantly (all P ≤ 0.003). However, only the manipulation group showed significantly favorable results in the Oswestry scores (P < 0.001), and the straight leg raise test (P = 0.001). All ranges of motion increased significantly with manipulation (all P < 0.001), but the control group showed favorable results only in right and left rotations and in extension (all P < 0.001). Between-group analyses showed significantly better outcomes for manipulation in all measurements (all P ≤ 0.009) with large effect sizes.

Conclusion

Spinal manipulation improves the results of physiotherapy over a period of 3 months for patients with subacute or chronic lumbar radiculopathy.

### Effect of caudal epidural steroid or saline injection in chronic lumbar radiculopathy: multicentre, blinded, randomised controlled trial [^114Cgqp7]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

This randomised controlled trial compared caudal epidural steroid or saline injections with subcutaneous sham injections. The results confirm the null hypothesis that treatment of chronic lumbar radiculopathy with caudal epidural injection of steroids or isotonic saline has no clinically important effect. We did not find any significant differences between the treatment groups in need of physiotherapy or surgery and the patients receiving sickness benefit. We expected fear avoidance belief scores to be low at baseline and to fall during follow-up, because patients were informed about the favourable prognosis of the lumbar radiculopathy and were repeatedly encouraged to stay active.

Comparison with existing literature

There is conflicting evidence on whether epidural steroid injections are efficacious, and if so, what volume, composition, or concentration of injection is best. Two randomised studies found that transforaminal steroid injections, which deposit the medication directly over the affected nerve roots, are more effective than caudal epidural steroid injections in the short term. We did not address this issue in our study.

Four randomised placebo controlled trials published between 1971 and 2009 with at least 12 months' follow-up, including between 23 and 183 participants, found no long term effect of caudal epidural steroid injections. One study showed a positive effect of caudal epidural steroid injection. However, the reported effect size (change in Oswestry disability index score of 8.1 points) was smaller than what is considered to be the minimal clinically significant difference.

High volumes of epidural solutions have been thought to clear or dilute locally concentrated chemical irritants around the spinal nerve roots. In our study, the effect of a high volume, caudal epidural saline injection did not differ from a sham injection. Our results suggest that the effect attributed to isotonic saline probably reflects the spontaneous, natural course of lumbar radiculopathy.

### The efficacy of therapeutic selective nerve block in treating lumbar radiculopathy and avoiding surgery [^112qTvd9]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Lumbar radiculopathy is defined as pain in the lower back, radiating to the lower limb along the course of a certain lumbar nerve caused by a pathological process such as inflammation or mechanical compression of that nerve root. It can affect the quality of life and limit the activities of affected patients. It is mostly caused by lumbar disc prolapse (LDP) compressing the nerve root or nerve root foraminal stenosis. Sciatica is a pain in the distribution of the sciatic nerve. Radicular pain can be associated with numbness, paresthesia, tingling, muscle weakness, and loss of specific reflexes, but even without the presence of these symptoms, we cannot exclude the diagnosis.

The compression of the nerve root is mostly caused by herniated discs in approximately 90% of cases. Additionally, foraminal stenosis and, less often, tumors, cysts, inflammation, and/or nerve root injury are other possible causes.

Most sciatica cases can be treated conservatively with rest, muscle relaxants, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and physiotherapy. Failure of conservative management is usually considered in the case of continuity of the pain for at least six weeks. On the other hand, the exact timing needed for the patient to stay on the conservative care before switching to another treatment method has not been appropriately evaluated. Meanwhile, an immediate surgical intervention is required in acute settings, especially in those with acute drop foot or bladder incontinence. In the absence of these red flags, there is much disagreement about surgery's effectiveness in chronic sciatica. Moreover, many patients might be reluctant to undergo surgery or may not be fit for general anesthesia, making it crucial to search for alternative management like Selective Nerve Root Block.

Selective nerve root block (SNRB) is a procedure that can be used as a diagnostic and therapeutic method. SNRB can be used in multiple sites, including cervical and lumbar. Steroids are usually injected near the spinal nerve as it exits from the intervertebral foramen. The use of steroids is due to their ability to reduce inflammation and induce numbness to the pain transmission through the nerve. The procedure can be done under fluoroscopy or CT guidance. The use of SNRB in patients with severe pain can reduce their pain and thus reduce their need for surgery. The objective of our study is to investigate the effectiveness of the use of fluoroscopy-guided therapeutic SNRB as a non-surgical option for patients with sciatica due to lumbar disc herniation and/or foraminal stenosis.

### Deconstructing chronic low back pain in the older adult-step by step evidence and expert-based recommendations for evaluation and treatment. part VIII: lateral hip and thigh pain [^116ZsSFX]. Pain Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Management of lumbar radicular pain depends on whether neurologic deficit is present. The definition of lumbar radiculopathy is radicular pain in the setting of focal weakness and/or asymmetrically diminished deep tendon reflexes. Objective sensory impairment may be evident on examination, but it is not a criterion for defining radiculopathy. Electrodiagnostic studies, although not necessary to make the diagnosis, are abnormal in lumbar radiculopathy. Deep tendon reflexes are commonly diminished bilaterally in older adults; therefore, in our algorithm we only recommend pursuing management of radiculopathy if the patient has objective evidence of asymmetric weakness on exam.

Patients with radiculopathy are at risk for progressive and permanent neurologic damage. Therefore, if a clinician is concerned for lumbar radiculopathy based on history and physical exam, the patient would benefit from urgent imaging and referral. Advanced imaging such as lumbar spine MRI (or CT if MRI is contraindicated) is useful to plan interventions such as epidural corticosteroid injections and/or surgical decompression. When referring the patient for specialist care, we recommend initial evaluation by a non-operative musculoskeletal provider if available, because not all radiculopathy requires surgical management. Seventy percent of patients with lumbar radiculopathy will improve with conservative care within 4 weeks of the onset of symptoms, and up to 90% of patients with lumbar radiculopathy from a herniated disc (in the absence of significant lumbar spinal stenosis) treated with core stabilization exercises and education eventually achieve good or excellent outcomes. Especially in the aging population, avoiding unnecessary surgical procedures can help minimize associated morbidity and peri-operative complications. Nevertheless, this population will require close follow-up for patients who do not improve and in those with functionally significant weakness that may benefit from surgical decompression within the first 8 weeks of symptom onset.

### An update of comprehensive evidence-based guidelines for interventional techniques in chronic spinal pain. part II: guidance and recommendations [^114ZLMiJ]. Pain Physician (2013). Medium credibility.

Lumbar disc herniation and radiculopathy — about 95% of herniated discs occur at the lower lumbar spine (L4/5 and L5/S1 level); disc herniation above this level is more common in people aged over 55 years. The estimated prevalence of lumbar radiculopathy or sciatica has been described as 9.8 per 1,000 cases, 5.1 in men and 3.7 in women. Lumbar radiculopathy secondary to disc herniation resolves spontaneously in 23% to 48% of patients, but up to 30% to 70% will still have significant symptoms after one year, with 5% to 15% of patients undergoing surgery. Based on controlled evaluations, lumbar intervertebral discography has been shown to diagnose internal disc disruption in 39% of a younger cohort of patients with low back pain, and in a study without assessing internal disc disruption the reported prevalence rate of discogenic pain was 26%.

### Best practices for minimally invasive lumbar spinal stenosis treatment 2.0 (MIST): consensus guidance from the American Society of Pain and Neuroscience (ASPN) [^114znBxQ]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Treatment varies depending on the etiology and severity of symptoms, but usually begins with conservative management of symptoms. Oral medications including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), acetaminophen, and neuropathic agents, such as gabapentin and pregabalin, are often used first to treat radicular symptoms, and in severe cases opiates may be used sparingly. Nonpharmacologic interventions, including physical therapy, acupuncture, chiropractic manipulation and traction are often utilized in conjunction with oral medications to treat lumbosacral radiculopathy. Of note, the data supporting the use of these conservative treatment modalities is equivocal. After failure of conservative treatment modalities, interventional techniques, including ESIs and percutaneous disc decompression, are also commonly used. In refractory cases, where patients fail conservative interventional techniques, surgical decompression and spinal fusion may be needed.

### An evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy [^114ttJtW]. The Spine Journal (2014). Medium credibility.

Lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy — diagnostic imaging selection and accuracy: In patients with history and physical examination findings consistent with lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy, CT scan, myelography and/or CT myelography are recommended as appropriate tests to confirm the presence of lumbar disc herniation (Grade of Recommendation: A). In a prospective comparative study, MRI was the most accurate test with 76.5% accuracy, CT myelography was 76%, CT was 73.6% and myelography was 71.4%, with CT myelography having the lowest false negative rate at 27.2% and MRI the lowest false positive rate at 13.5%; CT myelography had the greatest sensitivity (72.8%) and MRI the greatest specificity (86.5%). In a prospective comparison of CT versus myelography in 185 consecutive surgically confirmed cases, the CT true positive rate was 92% versus 87% for myelography, the false negative rate 8% versus 13%, the true negative rate 78% versus 89%, and the false positive rate 22% versus 11%, providing Level I diagnostic evidence that CT and myelography show comparable rates of diagnosis. In a retrospective series, MRI accurately predicted 98/102 disc levels (96%), while myelography accuracy was 81% and post-myelogram CT scan 57%; when myelography and CT scan were combined, accuracy was 84%. The authors concluded that MRI is a clinically superior diagnostic test and that it should be the diagnostic study of choice when available; this study provides Level I diagnostic evidence that MRI provides the most sensitivity and specificity when compared to myelography or CT myelography.

### A systematic review of clinical practice guidelines for persons with non-specific low back pain with and without radiculopathy: identification of best evidence for rehabilitation to develop the WHO's package of interventions for rehabilitation [^114DCQ6Y]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

To Identify evidence-based rehabilitation interventions for persons with non-specific low back pain (LBP) with and without radiculopathy and to develop recommendations from high-quality clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) to inform the World Health Organization's (WHO) Package of Interventions for Rehabilitation (PIR).

Data Source

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, National Health Services Economic Evaluation Database, Health Technology Assessment Database, PEDro, the Trip Database, the Index to Chiropractic Literature and the gray literature.

Study Selection

Eligible guidelines were (1) published between 2009 and 2019 in English, French, Italian, or Swedish; (2) included adults or children with non-specific LBP with or without radiculopathy; and (3) assessed the benefits of rehabilitation interventions on functioning. Pairs of independent reviewers assessed the quality of the CPGs using AGREE II.

Data Synthesis

We identified 4 high-quality CPGs. Recommended interventions included (1) education about recovery expectations, self-management strategies, and maintenance of usual activities; (2) multimodal approaches incorporating education, exercise, and spinal manipulation; (3) nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs combined with education in the acute stage; and (4) intensive interdisciplinary rehabilitation that includes exercise and cognitive/behavioral interventions for persistent pain. We did not identify high-quality CPGs for people younger than 16 years of age.

Conclusion

We developed evidence-based recommendations from high-quality CPGs to inform the WHO PIR for people with LBP with and without radiculopathy. These recommendations emphasize the potential benefits of education, exercise, manual therapy, and cognitive/behavioral interventions.

### The use of metformin is associated with decreased lumbar radiculopathy pain [^112zsxUE]. Journal of Pain Research (2013). Low credibility.

Discussion

This is the first retrospective study of the effect of metformin on lumbar radiculopathy pain. Our proof-of-concept findings suggest that metformin may have a beneficial effect on pain in lumbar radiculopathy. The major finding of this study is that "pain now" was significantly decreased in lumbar radiculopathy pain patients who were taking metformin, using two separate propensity-scoring methods. While many of the other indices were not statistically significantly different from those of patients not on metformin, many patients reported less pain (ie, point estimates were negative). Importantly, this finding is supported by mechanistic and therapeutic studies in preclinical pain models.–We propose that the preponderance of current clinical and preclinical evidence warrants larger retrospective trials using EHR databases to continue to test the hypothesis that metformin might be effective for neuropathic or other types of pain. However, ultimately a prospective trial investigating the efficacy of metformin in chronic neuropathic pain conditions will be needed to exclude the potential confound of diabetic neuropathyin the patient population that takes metformin.

Lumbar Radiculopathies

Radiculopathy is related to inflammation or compression of a nerve root with treatment focused on reducing edema and/or inflammation. Lumbosacral radiculopathy has a constellation of symptoms secondary to mechanical and/or inflammatory involvement of at least one of the lumbosacral nerve roots. These symptoms include radiating pain, numbness, tingling, weakness and possible gait abnormalities of the lower extremities in a particular dermatome or myotome, depending on the nerve root(s) affected.

The incidence of radicular symptoms in patients presenting with low back pain ranges from 12% to 40%. Any process that causes irritation or compression of the spinal nerves can cause radicular symptoms, with the most common etiology being degenerative changes of the spine, followed by trauma and benign or malignant tumors. Evaluation of a patient with radiculopathy starts with a history and physical examination with incorporation of the straight leg test or Lasègue test. A positive test with reproduction of the patient's symptoms during passive movement between 30 and 60 degrees is suggestive of L4 to S1 nerve root involvement. A reverse straight leg test or Ely test will stretch the femoral nerve, with a positive result indicating involvement of the L2 to L4 nerve roots. In cases of radiculopathy symptoms that fail to resolve within 1 to 2 months, MRI is considered the gold standard in evaluation. For patients unable to undergo an MRI, CT scan is an acceptable alternative. In those patients where it is difficult to clinically distinguish lumbosacral radiculopathy from peripheral neuropathy or plexopathy, EMG and NC studies can be utilized to localize a lesion with relatively high diagnostic specificity.

### Electrodiagnosis of lumbar radiculopathy [^114UcwtS]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

The evaluation of patients with suspected lumbar radiculopathy is one of the most common reasons patients are referred for electrodiagnostic testing. The utility of this study depends on the expertise of the physician who plans, performs, and completes the study. This article reviews the strengths and weaknesses of electrodiagnosis to make this diagnosis, as well as the clinical reasoning of appropriate study planning. The current use of electrodiagnostic testing to determine prognosis and treatment outcomes is also discussed.

### The effect of spinal mobilization with leg movement in patients with lumbar radiculopathy – A double-blind randomized controlled trial [^113CEa9U]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate the effect of spinal mobilization with leg movement (SMWLM) on low back and leg pain intensity, disability, pain centralization, and patient satisfaction in participants with lumbar radiculopathy.

Design

A double-blind randomized controlled trial.

Setting

General hospital.

Participants

Adults (N = 60; mean age 44y) with subacute lumbar radiculopathy.

Interventions

Participants were randomly allocated to receive SMWLM, exercise and electrotherapy (n = 30), or exercise and electrotherapy alone (n = 30). All participants received 6 sessions over 2 weeks.

Main Outcome Measures

The primary outcomes were leg pain intensity and Oswestry Disability Index score. Secondary variables were low back pain intensity, global rating of change (GROC), straight leg raise (SLR), and lumbar range of motion (ROM). Variables were evaluated blind at baseline, post-intervention, and at 3 and 6 months of follow-up.

Results

Significant and clinically meaningful improvement occurred in all outcome variables. At 2 weeks the SMWLM group had significantly greater improvement than the control group in leg pain (MD 2.0; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.4–2.6) and disability (MD 3.9; 95% CI, 5.5–2.2). Similarly, at 6 months, the SMWLM group had significantly greater improvement than the control group in leg pain (MD 2.6; 95% CI, 1.9–3.2) and disability (MD 4.7; 95% CI, 6.3–3.1). The SMWLM group also reported greater improvement in the GROC and in SLR ROM.

Conclusion

In patients with lumbar radiculopathy, the addition of SMWLM provided significantly improved benefits in leg and back pain, disability, SLR ROM, and patient satisfaction in the short and long term.

### A randomized, sham-controlled trial on the efficacy and safety of electroacupuncture for lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy: rationale and study protocol [^117NZsBK]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Electroacupuncture, validated in preclinical studies, is a promising alternative approach for lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy (LDHR). This trial aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of electroacupuncture in patients with LDHR.

Methods

This randomized, single-blind, sham-controlled trial will enroll 170 participants diagnosed with LDHR and who present Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) scores ≥ 4 for both lower back and leg pain. Participants will be allocated at a 1:1 ratio to receive either electroacupuncture or sham electroacupuncture (superficial needling at nonacupoint sites). The sample size was determined based on pilot study data and power calculations. Treatments will be administered three times weekly over 8 weeks (24 sessions total), with blinding maintained throughout. An 18-week noninterventional follow-up will be extended to address the knowledge gap regarding the durability of neuromodulatory effects of electroacupuncture. The following outcomes will be evaluated: 1) primary outcome: the proportion of responders achieving ≥ a 2-point NRS reduction in both lower back and leg pain from baseline at weeks 8 and 24; 2) secondary outcomes: changes from baseline at weeks 4, 8, 16, and 24 in the intensity of low back pain and leg pain, level of disability, severity of depression and anxiety, sleep quality, as well as the incidence of lumbar spine surgery and the proportion of use of analgesics at weeks 8 and 24; and 3) safety outcome: the incidence of adverse events. The efficacy outcomes will be analyzed based on the full analysis set with the modified intention-to-treat principle. Treatment effects will be estimated using a generalized linear mixed-effects model for repeated measures. Blinding validity will be assessed via James's and Bang's indices.

Conclusion

This rigorously designed randomized controlled trial will generate confirmatory evidence to support the efficacy and safety of electroacupuncture in the treatment of LDHR.

### An evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy [^116RoBdT]. The Spine Journal (2014). Medium credibility.

Lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy — intravenous glucocorticoids: VAS sciatic leg improvement of 5.7 cm occurred on day one, but no durable benefit was observed at day 30 with a single intravenous bolus of glucocorticoids for any outcome, and a glucocorticoid bolus had no effect on functioning or objective signs of radicular irritation. This study provides Level I therapeutic evidence that a single intravenous infusion of glucocorticoids provides only temporary (three days) relief of pain, with the authors concluding that a single intravenous pulse of glucocorticoid provides a small and transient improvement in sciatic leg pain.

Lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy — Williams' sequestrectomy late outcomes from a retrospective case series reported 104 consecutive patients with outcomes assessed at an average of 5.3 years; success rates (excellent, good, and fair) were 92.5%, 94.7%, and 93.3% for lumbago, radicular pain, and neurological dysfunction, respectively. The authors concluded that sequestrectomy alone is a safe operative modality and should be used when possible, and this study provides Level IV Therapeutic evidence that sequestrectomy is effective treatment at five-year follow-up.

### Deconstructing chronic low back pain in the older adult-step by step evidence and expert-based recommendations for evaluation and treatment. part VIII: lateral hip and thigh pain [^113vnYX4]. Pain Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Contrary to lumbar radiculopathy, lumbar radiculitis describes nerve root irritation without objective findings of nerve root damage (i.e. weakness or reflexes changes). Patients may complain of altered sensation (i.e. pain or pins and needles), but electrodiagnostic testing is normal and therefore not a recommended part of the work-up for lumbar radiculitis. For patients with lumbar radiculitis, we recommend a longer trial of conservative management prior to considering referral because, unlike in radiculopathy, these patients are not at immediate risk of progressive, permanent neurologic damage. For first-line treatment of radiculitis, we recommend McKenzie physical therapy, which is a standardized approach to the assessment and management of radicular pain. Also called Mechanical Diagnosis and Therapy (MDT), in this method McKenzie-certified therapists help patients identify a "directional preference" of lumbar spine motion (i.e. extension, flexion, and/or side-bending) which helps reduce radicular pain, centralize the pain to the back, and minimize pain altogether. McKenzie therapy teaches simple exercises which the patient should perform several times throughout the day, and it does not emphasize passive modalities such as manual massage or manipulation. Patients who respond well to McKenzie therapy are likely to be able achieve adequate pain relief without operative intervention.

### An evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy [^111h3FQP]. The Spine Journal (2014). Medium credibility.

Lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy — randomized controlled trial of spinal manipulation versus chemonucleolysis (Burton et al): A prospective randomized controlled trial tested whether manipulative treatment provides at least equivalent 12 month outcomes to chemonucleolysis; of the 40 patients, 20 were randomly assigned to manipulation and 20 to chemonucleolysis. Outcomes were assessed at 12 months using the Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire, a pain thermometer (back and leg) and lumbar range of motion, and by 12 months both groups had significant improvements without significant differences between groups. The authors concluded that osteopathic manipulation can be considered a safe and effective option in the absence of clear surgical indications, and due to small sample size the potential Level II study provides Level III therapeutic evidence that spinal manipulation is as effective as chemonucleolysis.

### Interventional techniques: evidence-based practice guidelines in the management of chronic spinal pain [^1149MbpT]. Pain Physician (2007). Low credibility.

Background

The evidence-based practice guidelines for the management of chronic spinal pain with interventional techniques were developed to provide recommendations to clinicians in the United States.

Objective

To develop evidence-based clinical practice guidelines for interventional techniques in the diagnosis and treatment of chronic spinal pain, utilizing all types of evidence and to apply an evidence-based approach, with broad representation by specialists from academic and clinical practices.

Design

Study design consisted of formulation of essentials of guidelines and a series of potential evidence linkages representing conclusions and statements about relationships between clinical interventions and outcomes.

Methods

The elements of the guideline preparation process included literature searches, literature synthesis, systematic review, consensus evaluation, open forum presentation, and blinded peer review. Methodologic quality evaluation criteria utilized included the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) criteria, Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS) criteria, and Cochrane review criteria. The designation of levels of evidence was from Level I (conclusive), Level II (strong), Level III (moderate), Level IV (limited), to Level V (indeterminate).

Results

Among the diagnostic interventions, the accuracy of facet joint nerve blocks is strong in the diagnosis of lumbar and cervical facet joint pain, whereas, it is moderate in the diagnosis of thoracic facet joint pain. The evidence is strong for lumbar discography, whereas, the evidence is limited for cervical and thoracic discography. The evidence for transforaminal epidural injections or selective nerve root blocks in the preoperative evaluation of patients with negative or inconclusive imaging studies is moderate. The evidence for diagnostic sacroiliac joint injections is moderate. The evidence for therapeutic lumbar intraarticular facet injections is moderate for short-term and long-term improvement, whereas, it is limited for cervical facet joint injections. The evidence for lumbar and cervical medial branch blocks is moderate. The evidence for medial branch neurotomy is moderate. The evidence for caudal epidural steroid injections is strong for short-term relief and moderate for long-term relief in managing chronic low back and radicular pain, and limited in managing pain of postlumbar laminectomy syndrome. The evidence for interlaminar epidural steroid injections is strong for short-term relief and limited for long-term relief in managing lumbar radiculopathy, whereas, for cervical radiculopathy the evidence is moderate. The evidence for transforaminal epidural steroid injections is strong for short-term and moderate for long-term improvement in managing lumbar nerve root pain, whereas, it is moderate for cervical nerve root pain and limited in managing pain secondary to lumbar post laminectomy syndrome and spinal stenosis. The evidence for percutaneous epidural adhesiolysis is strong. For spinal endoscopic adhesiolysis, the evidence is strong for short-term relief and moderate for long-term relief. For sacroiliac intraarticular injections, the evidence is moderate for short-term relief and limited for long-term relief. The evidence for radiofrequency neurotomy for sacroiliac joint pain is limited. The evidence for intradiscal electrothermal therapy is moderate in managing chronic discogenic low back pain, whereas for annuloplasty the evidence is limited. Among the various techniques utilized for percutaneous disc decompression, the evidence is moderate for short-term and limited for long-term relief for automated percutaneous lumbar discectomy, and percutaneous laser discectomy, whereas it is limited for nucleoplasty and for DeKompressor technology. For vertebral augmentation procedures, the evidence is moderate for both vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty. The evidence for spinal cord stimulation in failed back surgery syndrome and complex regional pain syndrome is strong for short-term relief and moderate for long-term relief. The evidence for implantable intrathecal infusion systems is strong for short-term relief and moderate for long-term relief.

Conclusion

These guidelines include the evaluation of evidence for diagnostic and therapeutic procedures in managing chronic spinal pain and recommendations for managing spinal pain. However, these guidelines do not constitute inflexible treatment recommendations. These guidelines also do not represent a "standard of care".

### Guideline update for the performance of fusion procedures for degenerative disease of the lumbar spine. part 8: lumbar fusion for disc herniation and radiculopathy [^116LwMUt]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine (2014). Low credibility.

Patients suffering from a lumbar herniated disc will typically present with signs and symptoms consistent with radiculopathy. They may also have low-back pain, however, and the source of this pain is less certain, as it may be from the degenerative process that led to the herniation. The surgical alternative of choice remains a lumbar discectomy, but fusions have been performed for both primary and recurrent disc herniations. In the original guidelines, the inclusion of a fusion for routine discectomies was not recommended. This recommendation continues to be supported by more recent evidence. Based on low-level evidence, the incorporation of a lumbar fusion may be considered an option when a herniation is associated with evidence of spinal instability, chronic low-back pain, and/or severe degenerative changes, or if the patient participates in heavy manual labor. For recurrent disc herniations, there is low-level evidence to support the inclusion of lumbar fusion for patients with evidence of instability or chronic low-back pain.

### An evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy [^111zJvB6]. The Spine Journal (2014). Medium credibility.

Lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy — trial data on traction, ultrasound and low power laser: Unlu et al conducted a prospective randomized controlled trial comparing the outcomes of traction, ultrasound (US) and low power laser (LPL) therapies in patients with acute lower back pain and leg pain caused by lumbar disc herniation. Of the 60 consecutive patients included in the study, 20 were assigned to each treatment group: mechanical traction with 35–50% body weight, ultrasound and low power laser, and outcomes were assessed in three months. There were significant reductions in pain and disability scores between baseline and follow-up in all three groups, with a significant reduction in the size of the disc herniation on MRI after treatment, but there was no correlation between clinical findings, pain and disability scores, and change in lumbar disc herniation size. The authors concluded that traction, ultrasound and low power laser therapies were all effective; because the randomization method was not defined, along with the small sample size, this potential Level 1 study provides Level II evidence that pain and disability due to acute lumbar radiculopathy secondary to lumbar disc herniation may improve over three months in patients treated with low power laser or ultrasound; however, the improvement is equivalent to that from mechanical traction with 35–50% body weight. The study provides case series (Level IV) evidence that pain and disability due to acute lumbar radiculopathy secondary to LDH may improve over three months in patients undergoing ultrasound or low power laser treatment, and since the study did not include an untreated control group, the possibility of spontaneous improvement in this group of patients cannot be excluded.

### Mimickers of lumbar radiculopathy [^113PT2TN]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2015). Low credibility.

Orthopaedic surgeons frequently treat patients who report pain that radiates from the back into the lower extremity. Although the most common etiology is either a herniated disk or spinal stenosis, a myriad of pathologies can mimic the symptoms of radiculopathy, resulting in differences in the clinical presentation and the workup. Therefore, the clinician must be able to distinguish the signs and symptoms of lumbar radiculopathy from pathologies that may have a similar presentation. Being cognizant of these other possible conditions enables the physician to consider a breadth of alternative diagnoses when a patient presents with radiating lower extremity pain.

Study Overview Study Duration: Pre-randomization Phase: 14 days; Treatment Phase: 12 weeks; Extension Phase: Ongoing; Total Study Duration: Up to 14 weeks + the duration of the extension phase. For each subject, the study consists of three phases: Pre-randomization phase, Treatment Phase and an extension phase where subjects have the opportunity to receive lenalidomide treatment as long as benefit is derived from the drug. Subjects who complete all 12 weeks of the treatment phase may be eligible to initiate or continue to receive lenalidomide therapy in the extension phase. Subjects may continue in the extension phase as long as a benefit is derived from the drug.
- History of painful radiculopathy involving one or both of the distal lower extremities for greater than or equal to 6 months
- MRI or CT scan within the past 2 years or more recent if symptoms have changed
- Positive straight leg raising test in the index ipsilateral leg. In the presence of bilateral leg pain, the leg with the most severe pain will be designated the index leg. The two methods of contraception must include one highly effective method aspirin regimen], tubal ligation, partner's vasectomy) and one additional effective method. If a hormonal method or IUD is not medically possible for the subject, two of the barrier methods will be acceptable.
- Pain localized in the low back or other sites that is a greater component of subject's total pain problem than lower leg and foot pain
- Ankle or foot problems, which could interfere with the assessment of radiculopathy pain
- Unstable lumbar spinal segment
