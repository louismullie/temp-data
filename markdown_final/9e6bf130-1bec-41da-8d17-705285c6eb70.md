## Question

Beta-blockers benefits in heart failure

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the benefits of beta-blockers in heart failure. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and phenotypes of heart failure where beta-blockers are beneficial. Then, I should verify the magnitude and consistency of mortality and hospitalization benefits from randomized trials and meta-analyses. Next, I will examine which specific beta-blockers have proven benefit and whether there is a class effect. After that, I need to check guideline recommendations and how they differ by phenotype. I will then review special populations and safety/titration considerations. Finally, I should reconcile conflicting data in HFpEF and synthesize a practical, guideline-concordant bottom line with caveats and monitoring needs.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and phenotypes. Beta-blockers are foundational therapy in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF, LVEF ≤ 40%), with benefits extending to patients with mildly reduced ejection fraction (HFmrEF, LVEF 41–49%) in many analyses, whereas evidence in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF, LVEF ≥ 50%) remains limited and mixed, so I should be cautious not to overgeneralize beyond HFrEF where the data are strongest [^112mBNXd] [^115RZVLw] [^1113JZUw].

> I will now examine the magnitude of benefit in HFrEF. Multiple large randomized trials and meta-analyses consistently show about a 30–35% relative risk reduction in all-cause mortality and a roughly 40% reduction in heart failure hospitalizations, with benefits seen across NYHA class II–IV and in both ischemic and nonischemic etiologies; for example, MERIT-HF and CIBIS-II each demonstrated approximately 34% mortality reductions, and network meta-analyses confirm a class-level mortality benefit without clear superiority among agents, which reassures me that the effect is robust and reproducible [^1118P7Zm] [^111rkSJ4] [^115WnJKk] [^114Bskx1].

> Wait, let me verify which agents are truly evidence-based. Guidelines recommend only three beta-blockers with proven mortality benefit in HFrEF: carvedilol, bisoprolol, and metoprolol succinate (extended-release); I initially thought nebivolol might be in this core group, but hold on, I should correct that — while SENIORS suggested benefit across EF strata, nebivolol is not included among the three mortality-proven agents in contemporary U.S. guidelines, so I should not list it with carvedilol, bisoprolol, and metoprolol succinate when stating "proven" therapy [^112mBNXd] [^113roJAv] [^115HCxUD].

> Next, I should review guideline direction to ensure alignment. ACC/AHA/HFSA 2022 gives a Class I recommendation to initiate one of the three proven beta-blockers in symptomatic HFrEF to reduce mortality and hospitalizations, and ESC 2021 similarly recommends beta-blockers for stable NYHA II–IV HFrEF; for HFmrEF, guidelines suggest considering GDMT used in HFrEF, particularly toward the lower end of the EF spectrum, acknowledging extrapolated evidence rather than definitive RCTs [^112mBNXd] [^115Emj6D] [^115RZVLw].

> I need to check special populations and modifiers of benefit. In diabetes, beta-blockers remain beneficial but the absolute risk reduction is smaller than in nondiabetics, so I should not withhold therapy solely due to diabetes; in older adults, observational and quasi-experimental data show persistent benefit even in those ≥ 75 years, supporting use unless contraindicated; in COPD, cardioselective beta-1 blockers are generally safe with monitoring, though I should confirm airway status and start low and go slow [^113kUy51] [^113o9RoQ] [^114VXyAY].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about HFpEF. I should double-check the signal here. Some meta-analyses and observational cohorts suggest possible reductions in cardiovascular mortality with beta-blockers in HFpEF, but the certainty is low and not based on large, dedicated RCTs; moreover, a high-quality secondary analysis from TOPCAT found that beta-blocker use was associated with more heart failure hospitalizations in patients with EF ≥ 50%, whereas no such signal was seen in those with EF 45–49%, indicating potential harm in the highest EF stratum; thus, routine beta-blocker therapy for HFpEF is not guideline-recommended, though I may continue beta-blockers for compelling comorbid indications like CAD, AF rate control, or hypertension, and I should individualize decisions and monitor closely [^114ToofK] [^114q1j4h] [^1156h8GZ] [^111aBDwR].

> I should confirm dosing strategy and safety. Benefits are dose-related, so I need to titrate to target doses used in trials: carvedilol 25–50 mg twice daily, bisoprolol 10 mg once daily, and metoprolol succinate 200 mg once daily, starting at very low doses and increasing every 2 weeks as tolerated; real-world data show a persistent "titration gap", with most patients remaining on subtherapeutic doses, which likely attenuates benefit; I also need to ensure euvolemia before initiation, avoid starting in decompensated states, and monitor heart rate, blood pressure, and symptoms during up-titration [^111WJHYY] [^114p8N7W] [^1119ia2u] [^116LtvZ9].

> But wait, what if the patient is in atrial fibrillation — does beta-blocker benefit persist? A patient-level meta-analysis suggests mortality benefit in sinus rhythm but not in AF, likely reflecting different mechanisms of benefit and the limited impact of rate slowing alone in AF; nonetheless, beta-blockers remain appropriate for AF rate control in HFrEF, and I should balance rate targets with tolerance and consider alternatives like digoxin when needed, recognizing that rhythm-control strategies have not improved outcomes in HF populations broadly [^115AizU6] [^11488C8o].

> Let me reconsider the overall synthesis to ensure internal consistency. In HFrEF, beta-blockers confer substantial, reproducible reductions in mortality and hospitalizations across etiologies and symptom classes, with the clearest evidence for carvedilol, bisoprolol, and metoprolol succinate; in HFmrEF, benefits are plausible and guideline-supported toward the lower EF range; in HFpEF, evidence is insufficient and observational signals are conflicting, with potential harm at higher EF, so beta-blockers should not be initiated solely for HFpEF in the absence of another indication; across all groups, careful selection, slow titration to target doses, and vigilant monitoring are essential to realize the magnitude of benefit seen in trials [^112mBNXd] [^115RZVLw] [^114q1j4h] [^114p8N7W].

---

Beta-blockers are a cornerstone of HFrEF therapy [^112mBNXd] because they **reduce mortality by ~35%** [^1118P7Zm] and **hospitalizations by ~40%** [^111rkSJ4] in stable patients with LV systolic dysfunction. They improve symptoms, reverse remodeling, and lower sudden cardiac death risk [^116XfFTc], with benefits across ischemic and nonischemic etiologies [^114Bskx1] and in older adults [^113o9RoQ]. Use bisoprolol, carvedilol, or metoprolol succinate [^112mBNXd] and titrate to target doses [^114p8N7W]; avoid in decompensated HF or bradyarrhythmias [^1166nxHy]. Evidence in HFpEF is limited [^111aBDwR]; use only for compelling indications (e.g. AF, CAD) [^111aBDwR].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting beta-blocker use in heart failure

Multiple large RCTs and meta-analyses show **consistent mortality and morbidity benefits** in HFrEF:

- **MERIT-HF**: Metoprolol CR/XL reduced all-cause mortality by 34% and sudden death by 41%.
- **CIBIS-II**: Bisoprolol reduced all-cause mortality by 34% and HF hospitalizations by 32%.
- **COPERNICUS**: Carvedilol reduced all-cause mortality by 35% in severe HF.
- **Meta-analyses**: ~35% mortality reduction and ~40% hospitalization reduction [^111rkSJ4] [^1168VPy5].

---

## Mechanisms of benefit

Beta-blockers confer benefit through **neurohormonal modulation** and direct cardiac effects:

- **Reverse remodeling**: Reduce LV size and mass, improve EF [^1173xHAP].
- **Reduced sympathetic activity**: Lower heart rate, myocardial oxygen demand, and ischemia [^113YCX83].
- **Antiarrhythmic effects**: Lower sudden cardiac death risk [^116XfFTc].
- **Anti-ischemic effects**: Benefit both ischemic and nonischemic HF [^114Bskx1].

---

## Patient populations benefiting from beta-blocker therapy

Beta-blockers benefit a **broad range of HFrEF patients**, including:

| **Patient population** | **Evidence of benefit** |
|-|-|
| Ischemic cardiomyopathy | - Consistent mortality reduction [^114Bskx1] <br/> - Improved EF and symptoms [^1173xHAP] |
| Non-ischemic cardiomyopathy | - Similar mortality benefit [^114Bskx1] <br/> - Improved EF and symptoms [^1173xHAP] |
| Elderly patients (≥ 75 years) | - Reduced 90-day mortality and readmissions [^113o9RoQ] <br/> - Benefits persist with age [^113D8fAS] |
| Patients with diabetes mellitus | - Mortality benefit albeit slightly smaller than in non-diabetics [^113kUy51] <br/> - Improved insulin sensitivity with carvedilol [^113sx9d8] |

---

## Specific beta-blockers recommended

Guidelines recommend **only agents with proven mortality benefit**:

| **Beta-blocker** | **Recommended dose** | **Clinical evidence** |
|-|-|-|
| Bisoprolol | 1.25 mg → 10 mg daily | CIBIS-II [^111coyGC] |
| Carvedilol | 3.125 mg → 25–50 mg BID | COPERNICUS [^111coyGC] |
| Metoprolol succinate | 12.5–25 mg → 200 mg daily | MERIT-HF [^111coyGC] |

---

## Timing and titration of therapy

- **Initiation**: Start low, titrate every 2 weeks to target or maximally tolerated dose [^114p8N7W].
- **Timing**: Begin once stable, after decongestion and off IV inotropes [^1166nxHy].
- **Monitoring**: Watch for bradycardia, hypotension, and worsening HF during up-titration [^113Pdmji].

---

## Potential risks and contraindications

Beta-blockers are generally well tolerated, but **key risks and contraindications** include:

- **Bradycardia**: Avoid if baseline HR < 50 bpm.
- **Hypotension**: Use cautiously if SBP < 90 mmHg.
- **Worsening HF**: Avoid in decompensated HF or recent IV inotrope use [^1166nxHy].
- **Bronchospasm**: Use cardioselective agents cautiously in asthma/COPD [^114VXyAY].

---

## Beta-blockers in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF)

Evidence in HFpEF is limited and inconsistent; **no clear mortality benefit** has been demonstrated [^111aBDwR]. Consider beta-blockers in HFpEF only for **compelling indications** such as AF rate control, CAD, or hypertension [^114q1j4h].

---

## Comparison with other heart failure therapies

Beta-blockers are **complementary to ACEi/ARB/ARNI, MRAs, and SGLT2i**, each reducing mortality/hospitalizations via distinct mechanisms [^114uom3G]. Combined therapy yields additive benefits and is central to guideline-directed medical therapy [^111ydUJ1].

---

## Current guidelines and recommendations

Both ACC/AHA/HFSA and ESC give **Class I recommendations** to use bisoprolol, carvedilol, or metoprolol succinate in symptomatic HFrEF to reduce mortality and hospitalizations [^112mBNXd] [^115Emj6D].

---

Beta-blockers are foundational in HFrEF, **reducing mortality and hospitalizations** and improving symptoms and remodeling. Use evidence-based agents, titrate to target, and apply clinical judgment in HFpEF or when contraindications arise.

Context

Care of patients with heart failure has been revolutionized throughout the past decade. A paradigm shift in the strategy for treating heart failure caused by systolic dysfunction is in progress. Despite the initial perception about beta-blockers' safety, they are now the most extensively studied class of agents in the treatment of heart failure and have emerged as an important intervention to improve the clinical outcomes of heart failure patients.

Objective

To provide scientific rationale for the use of beta-blockers for patients with heart failure.

Data Sources

All English-language articles of large, randomized controlled clinical trials assessing the mortality benefits of beta-blockers in patients with heart failure were identified to provide the scientific rationale for the use of beta-blockers in heart failure. Basic science studies were reviewed to provide an overview of the potential physiologic role of beta-blockers in heart failure. Finally, clinical guidelines for the treatment of patients with heart failure were assessed to determine current recommendations for the use of these agents.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Randomized controlled clinical trials of beta-blockers that included more than 300 subjects and assessed mortality as a primary end point.

Data Synthesis

Of the 4 beta-blockers tested in large randomized controlled clinical trials of patients with heart failure, 3 are available in the United States, bisoprolol, carvedilol, and metoprolol; 2 of these, carvedilol and metoprolol, have Food and Drug Administration indications for the treatment of heart failure. Compared with placebo treatment, beta-blocker use is associated with a consistent 30% reduction in mortality and a 40% reduction in hospitalizations in patients with class II and III heart failure.

Conclusions

Tested in more than 10,000 patients, beta-blockers reduce morbidity and mortality in class II through IV heart failure. Along with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, digoxin, and diuretics, beta-blockers have strengthened the armamentarium to improve clinical outcomes of heart failure patients. The science supporting beta-blockers must be translated into practice safely and rationally if the agents are to achieve their full potential.

### Influence of β-blockers on mortality in chronic heart failure [^115HCxUD]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2000). Low credibility.

Objective

To briefly discuss the pathophysiology of heart failure and the rationale for the use of beta-blockers in the treatment of chronic heart failure. Key morbidity reduction trials are briefly mentioned, and recent mortality reduction trials are reviewed. General recommendations regarding the use of beta-blockers in heart failure are also included to guide clinical practice.

Study Selection/Data Extraction

Randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials and meta-analyses evaluating mortality reduction with beta-blockers in the treatment of heart failure were identified using a MEDLINE search from January 1993 to March 2000. Abstracts and presented results from recent scientific meetings were also considered.

Data Synthesis

Beta-blockers have been shown to decrease hospitalization for worsening heart failure, decrease the need for heart transplant, improve New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class, and increase left-ventricular ejection fraction. A mortality benefit has recently been demonstrated for patients with chronic heart failure. Carvedilol, bisoprolol, and controlled-release/extended-release metoprolol decreased the risk of dying by 65%, 34%, and 34%, respectively, in patients with primarily NYHA functional class II or III and systolic dysfunction. The benefit of these agents in patients with class IV heart failure or determining whether one agent has an advantage over another is being investigated in ongoing clinical trials.

Conclusions

Several beta-blockers have demonstrated mortality reduction in the treatment of patients with NYHA functional class II or III heart failure and systolic dysfunction. Beta-blockers should be considered in these patients when they are clinically stable and taking the current standard therapy of a diuretic plus an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or other vasodilator agent.

### Benefits of inpatient initiation of β-blockers [^111omfeZ]. American Heart Journal (2004). Low credibility.

Clinical trials have demonstrated that beta-blockers effectively reduce mortality in patients after a myocardial infarction (MI) and in patients with chronic heart failure. Treatment guidelines recommend that all patients after MI without a contraindication receive early beta-blocker treatment. Initiation of beta-blockers also should be considered for stable patients who are hospitalized with heart failure. Despite well-documented benefits, however, beta-blockers are still underused. Barriers that cause reluctance by physicians to initiate therapy include the traditional belief that beta-blockers are contraindicated in patients with left ventricular dysfunction, complexity of management, perceived risk of adverse events, and potential for short-term clinical deterioration. Intervention programs promoting beta-blockers for inpatients have increased their use at discharge and after long-term follow-up. Because of pharmacologic differences, agent selection is also critical. Agents must have proven clinical efficacy, an established dose-titration regimen, and desirable pharmacokinetic properties. Increasing the use of these life-saving agents has the potential for substantial clinical impact.

### Practical recommendations for the use of ACE inhibitors, β-blockers, aldosterone antagonists and angiotensin receptor blockers in heart failure: putting guidelines into practice [^11664hjw]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2005). Low credibility.

Surveys of prescribing patterns in both hospitals and primary care have usually shown delays in translating the evidence from clinical trials of pharmacological agents into clinical practice, thereby denying patients with heart failure (HF) the benefits of drug treatments proven to improve well-being and prolong life. This may be due to unfamiliarity with the evidence-base for these therapies, the clinical guidelines recommending the use of these treatments or both, as well as concerns regarding adverse events. ACE inhibitors have long been the cornerstone of therapy for systolic HF irrespective of aetiology. Recent trials have now shown that treatment with beta-blockers, aldosterone antagonists and angiotensin receptor blockers also leads to substantial improvements in outcome. In order to accelerate the safe uptake of these treatments and to ensure that all eligible patients receive the most appropriate medications, a clear and concise set of clinical recommendations has been prepared by a group of clinicians with practical expertise in the management of HF. The objective of these recommendations is to provide practical guidance for non-specialists, in order to increase the use of evidenced based therapy for HF. These practical recommendations are meant to serve as a supplement to, rather than replacement of, existing HF guidelines.

### Drug treatment effects on outcomes in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114ToofK]. Heart (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In trials enrolling patients with HFpEF, defined using an LV ejection fraction ≥ 40%, beta-blockers reduce all-cause and cardiovascular mortality by 22% and 25%, respectively. There was no significant effect of ACE inhibitors, ARB or MRA on the same outcomes. The effect of treatments on functional and quality of life outcomes was limited. Further adequately powered RCTs in beta-blocker therapy in this patient group is warranted to confirm this finding.

Key messages

What is already known on this subject?

There have been no individual large randomised controlled trials which demonstrate improvements in clinical outcomes for patients with heart failure and preserved ejection fraction. This is represented in the latest European Society of Cardiology Heart Failure guidelines, which advocate treatment of comorbidities and symptoms.

What might this study add?

This meta-analysis shows that pooled analysis of beta-blocker trials demonstrates reductions in all-cause and cardiovascular mortality by 22% and 25%, respectively, with no pooled effect seen in ACE inhibitor, angiotensin receptor blocker and mineralocorticoid antagonist trials. There may also be a small benefit in terms of quality of life with several of the drug classes tested, although no difference in functional outcomes.

How might this impact on clinical practice?

Clinicians should consider using beta-blockers when there is an existing indication for them. There may be benefit in repeating a randomised controlled trial of beta-blockers in heart failure with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction with contemporary patient cohorts.

Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Practical use of beta-blockers — selection of patients and initiation: Beta-blockers should be prescribed to all patients with stable HF due to reduced LVEF unless they have a contraindication or are unable to tolerate them, and treatment with a beta-blocker should be initiated as soon as left ventricular (LV) dysfunction is diagnosed. Therapy should not be delayed until symptoms return or disease progression is documented, and even patients with little disability should receive treatment with a beta-blocker to reduce the risk of disease progression, future clinical deterioration, and sudden death. Patients need not be taking high doses of ACEIs prior to starting a beta-blocker, and in those taking a low dose of an ACEI, adding a beta-blocker produces a greater improvement in symptoms and reduction in risk of death than increasing the ACEI dose to trial targets. In patients with a current or recent history of fluid retention, beta-blockers should not be prescribed without diuretics.

### Beta-blocker benefit according to severity of heart failure [^116tHBU9]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2003). Low credibility.

Background and Aims

Beta-blockers are an established treatment for chronic heart failure. However, the relationship between their benefit and the severity of the disease remains to be determined.

Methods and Results

We studied the relationship between amplitude of benefit of beta-blockers and severity of chronic heart failure, based on data for mortality and hospitalizations for worsening heart failure, using a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials, complementary subgroup analyses and analysis of individual data from the CIBIS II trial. In the meta-analysis, mortality was reduced by 22% (95%CI: 16 to 28) and hospitalizations for worsening heart failure by 24% (95%CI: 20 to 29). Benefit was similar with metoprolol, bisoprolol and carvedilol. After exclusion of bucindolol trials, due to the heterogeneity of results for mortality, the reduction in mortality was similar according to the severity of heart failure, assessed either by left ventricular ejection fraction or by New York Heart Association classification. In CIBIS II, beta-blockers induced a significant reduction in mortality of 45% (95%CI: 9 to 66), 41% (95%CI: 17 to 59) and 23% (95%CI: 1 to 40) in the low, intermediate and high risk groups, respectively. Hospitalizations were reduced by 35% (95%CI: 2 to 57), 41% (95%CI: 18 to 58) and 23% (95%CI: 0 to 41), there was no significant difference between the three score groups.

Conclusion

We conclude that the amplitude of benefit of the beta-blockers carvedilol, metoprolol and bisoprolol on mortality and morbidity is similar, regardless of the severity of chronic heart failure.

### Beta-blockers in patients without heart failure after myocardial infarction [^112Vp7kt]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Cardiovascular disease is the number one cause of death globally. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 7.4 million people died from ischaemic heart disease in 2012, constituting 15% of all deaths. Beta-blockers are recommended and are often used in patients with heart failure after acute myocardial infarction. However, it is currently unclear whether beta-blockers should be used in patients without heart failure after acute myocardial infarction. Previous meta-analyses on the topic have shown conflicting results. No previous systematic review using Cochrane methods has assessed the effects of beta-blockers in patients without heart failure after acute myocardial infarction.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of beta-blockers compared with placebo or no treatment in patients without heart failure and with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) greater than 40% in the non-acute phase after myocardial infarction.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, Science Citation Index - Expanded, BIOSIS Citation Index, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, ClinicalTrials.gov, European Medicines Agency, Food and Drug Administration, Turning Research Into Practice, Google Scholar, and SciSearch from their inception to February 2021.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomised clinical trials assessing effects of beta-blockers versus control (placebo or no treatment) in patients without heart failure after myocardial infarction, irrespective of publication type and status, date, and language. We excluded trials randomising participants with diagnosed heart failure at the time of randomisation.

Data Collection and Analysis

We followed our published protocol, with a few changes made, and methodological recommendations provided by Cochrane and Jakobsen and colleagues. Two review authors independently extracted data. Our primary outcomes were all-cause mortality, serious adverse events, and major cardiovascular events (composite of cardiovascular mortality and non-fatal myocardial reinfarction). Our secondary outcomes were quality of life, angina, cardiovascular mortality, and myocardial infarction during follow-up. We assessed all outcomes at maximum follow-up. We systematically assessed risks of bias using seven bias domains and we assessed the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We included 25 trials randomising a total of 22,423 participants (mean age 56.9 years). All trials and outcomes were at high risk of bias. In all, 24 of 25 trials included a mixed group of participants with ST-elevation myocardial infarction and non-ST myocardial infarction, and no trials provided separate results for each type of infarction. One trial included participants with only ST-elevation myocardial infarction. All trials except one included participants younger than 75 years of age. Methods used to exclude heart failure were various and were likely insufficient. A total of 21 trials used placebo, and four trials used no intervention, as the comparator. All patients received usual care; 24 of 25 trials were from the pre-reperfusion era (published from 1974 to 1999), and only one trial was from the reperfusion era (published in 2018). The certainty of evidence was moderate to low for all outcomes. Our meta-analyses show that beta-blockers compared with placebo or no intervention probably reduce the risks of all-cause mortality (risk ratio (RR) 0.81, 97.5% confidence interval (CI) 0.73 to 0.90; I² = 15%; 22,085 participants, 21 trials; moderate-certainty evidence) and myocardial reinfarction (RR 0.76, 98% CI 0.69 to 0.88; I² = 0%; 19,606 participants, 19 trials; moderate-certainty evidence). Our meta-analyses show that beta-blockers compared with placebo or no intervention may reduce the risks of major cardiovascular events (RR 0.72, 97.5% CI 0.69 to 0.84; 14,994 participants, 15 trials; low-certainty evidence) and cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.73, 98% CI 0.68 to 0.85; I² = 47%; 21,763 participants, 19 trials; low-certainty evidence). Hence, evidence seems to suggest that beta-blockers versus placebo or no treatment may result in a minimum reduction of 10% in RR for risks of all-cause mortality, major cardiovascular events, cardiovascular mortality, and myocardial infarction. However, beta-blockers compared with placebo or no intervention may not affect the risk of angina (RR 1.04, 98% CI 0.93 to 1.13; I² = 0%; 7115 participants, 5 trials; low-certainty evidence). No trials provided data on serious adverse events according to good clinical practice from the International Committee for Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH-GCP), nor on quality of life.

Authors' Conclusions

Beta-blockers probably reduce the risks of all-cause mortality and myocardial reinfarction in patients younger than 75 years of age without heart failure following acute myocardial infarction. Beta-blockers may further reduce the risks of major cardiovascular events and cardiovascular mortality compared with placebo or no intervention in patients younger than 75 years of age without heart failure following acute myocardial infarction. These effects could, however, be driven by patients with unrecognised heart failure. The effects of beta-blockers on serious adverse events, angina, and quality of life are unclear due to sparse data or no data at all. All trials and outcomes were at high risk of bias, and incomplete outcome data bias alone could account for the effect seen when major cardiovascular events, angina, and myocardial infarction are assessed. The evidence in this review is of moderate to low certainty, and the true result may depart substantially from the results presented here. Future trials should particularly focus on patients 75 years of age and older, and on assessment of serious adverse events according to ICH-GCP and quality of life. Newer randomised clinical trials at low risk of bias and at low risk of random errors are needed if the benefits and harms of beta-blockers in contemporary patients without heart failure following acute myocardial infarction are to be assessed properly. Such trials ought to be designed according to the SPIRIT statement and reported according to the CONSORT statement.

### Beta-blockers in congestive heart failure. A Bayesian meta-analysis [^111rkSJ4]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Purpose

Congestive heart failure is an important cause of patient morbidity and mortality. Although several randomized clinical trials have compared beta-blockers with placebo for treatment of congestive heart failure, a meta-analysis quantifying the effect on mortality and morbidity has not been performed recently.

Data Sources

The MEDLINE, Cochrane, and Web of Science electronic databases were searched from 1966 to July 2000. References were also identified from bibliographies of pertinent articles.

Study Selection

All randomized clinical trials of beta-blockers versus placebo in chronic stable congestive heart failure were included.

Data Extraction

A specified protocol was followed to extract data on patient characteristics, beta-blocker used, overall mortality, hospitalizations for congestive heart failure, and study quality.

Data Synthesis

A hierarchical random-effects model was used to synthesize the results. A total of 22 trials involving 10 135 patients were identified. There were 624 deaths among 4862 patients randomly assigned to placebo and 444 deaths among 5273 patients assigned to beta-blocker therapy. In these groups, 754 and 540 patients, respectively, required hospitalization for congestive heart failure. The probability that beta-blocker therapy reduced total mortality and hospitalizations for congestive heart failure was almost 100%. The best estimates of these advantages are 3.8 lives saved and 4 fewer hospitalizations per 100 patients treated in the first year after therapy. The probability that these benefits are clinically significant (> 2 lives saved or > 2 fewer hospitalizations per 100 patients treated) is 99%. Both selective and nonselective agents produced these salutary effects. The results are robust to any reasonable publication bias.

Conclusions

beta-Blocker therapy is associated with clinically meaningful reductions in mortality and morbidity in patients with stable congestive heart failure and should be routinely offered to all patients similar to those included in trials.

### Systematic review of the impact of beta blockers on mortality and hospital admissions in heart failure [^1168VPy5]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2001). Low credibility.

Heart failure is a common condition that carries a high burden of mortality and morbidity. Several randomised trials have evaluated the effects of beta blockers in heart failure. This paper gives a systematic overview of published randomised trials of beta blockers in heart failure using standard methods. In all, 22 randomised controlled trials were identified with a total of 10480 patients, and an average of 11 months of treatment. The average age was 61 years and 4% were female. Most studies excluded patients with severe heart failure. Death rates in patients randomised to receive beta blockers compared to controls were 458/5657 (8.0%) and 635/4951 (12.8%) respectively, odds ratio 0.63, 95% CI 0.55–0.72, P < 0.00001. Similar reductions were observed for hospital admissions for worsening heart failure (11.3 vs. 17.1%, respectively, odds ratio 0.63) and for the composite outcome of death or heart-failure hospital admission (19.4 vs. 26.9%, respectively, odds ratio 0.66). These results show that beta blockers reduce the risk of mortality or the need for heart-failure hospital admission by approximately one third. Absolute reductions of 5–6% in event rates were observed over approximately 1 year of treatment period. These important benefits should be implemented as a priority, since treatment with beta blockers is inexpensive and heart failure carries a high risk of death and disability. Further information on the effect of beta blockers in elderly patients and women would be helpful.

### Benefits of β blockers in patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction: network meta-analysis [^115WnJKk]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To clarify whether any particular β blocker is superior in patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction or whether the benefits of these agents are mainly due to a class effect.

Design

Systematic review and network meta-analysis of efficacy of different β blockers in heart failure.

Data Sources

CINAHL(1982–2011), Cochrane Collaboration Central Register of Controlled Trials (-2011), Embase (1980–2011), Medline/PubMed (1966–2011), and Web of Science (1965–2011).

Study Selection

Randomized trials comparing β blockers with other β blockers or other treatments.

Data Extraction

The primary endpoint was all cause death at the longest available follow-up, assessed with odds ratios and Bayesian random effect 95% credible intervals, with independent extraction by observers.

Results

21 trials were included, focusing on atenolol, bisoprolol, bucindolol, carvedilol, metoprolol, and nebivolol. As expected, in the overall analysis, β blockers provided credible mortality benefits in comparison with placebo or standard treatment after a median of 12 months (odds ratio 0.69, 0.56 to 0.80). However, no obvious differences were found when comparing the different β blockers head to head for the risk of death, sudden cardiac death, death due to pump failure, or drug discontinuation. Accordingly, improvements in left ventricular ejection fraction were also similar irrespective of the individual study drug.

Conclusion

The benefits of β blockers in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction seem to be mainly due to a class effect, as no statistical evidence from current trials supports the superiority of any single agent over the others.

Regarding medical management for heart failure, more specifically with respect to beta-blockers, ACC/AHA/HFSA 2022 guidelines recommend to initiate one of the three β-blockers proven to reduce mortality (bisoprolol, carvedilol, sustained-release metoprolol succinate) to reduce mortality and hospitalizations in patients with HFrEF with current or previous symptoms.

Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Chronic heart failure — trial populations and outcomes with beta-blockers: Beta-blockers have been evaluated in more than 20 000 patients across more than 20 published placebo-controlled trials, enrolling patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) defined as EF less than 35% to 45% who were already treated with diuretics and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), with or without digitalis. Trials generally excluded or underrepresented patients with preserved systolic function, low heart rates (less than 65 beats per min), low systolic blood pressure (less than 85 mm Hg), hospitalization, or class IV HF; one carvedilol trial enrolled clinically stable NYHA class III and IV patients free of edema and showed a mortality reduction similar to less advanced disease. Collectively, long-term beta-blocker therapy can lessen HF symptoms, improve clinical status and well-being, and reduce the risk of death and the combined risk of death or hospitalization, with benefits seen regardless of coronary artery disease or diabetes status and in women and black patients; favorable effects were also observed in patients already taking ACEIs, suggesting additive effects from combined blockade of the 2 neurohormonal systems.

Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Chronic heart failure — beta-blockers with proven mortality benefit and agent selection is summarized as follows: Three beta-blockers have been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of death in patients with chronic heart failure (HF): bisoprolol, sustained-release metoprolol (succinate), and carvedilol; positive findings with these 3 agents should not be considered a class effect, and patients who have Stage C HF should be treated with 1 of these 3 beta-blockers. In one head-to-head trial, carvedilol (target dose 25 mg twice daily) versus immediate-release metoprolol tartrate (target dose 50 mg twice daily) was associated with a significantly reduced mortality, and there have been no trials to explore whether the survival benefits of carvedilol are greater than those of sustained-release metoprolol when both are used at the target doses.

Rationale and recommendations for dosing of beta blockers in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction emphasize outcome benefits and titration to target or maximally tolerated doses. The rationale states that use of guideline-recommended beta blockers "has been proven to reduce morbidity and mortality in patients with HFrEF, and studies have supported a dose-response relationship of beta blockers with improved outcomes", and that "treating at less than the target dose may result in worse clinical outcomes" with "the percentage of patients achieving these doses is low and remains low over time". It adds, "Treatment with a beta blocker should be initiated at very low doses, followed by gradual incremental increases in dose if lower doses have been well tolerated. Clinicians should make every effort to achieve the target doses of the beta blockers shown to be effective in major clinical trials". The 2013 ACCF/AHA guideline specifies, "Use of 1 of the 3 beta blockers proven to reduce mortality (eg, bisoprolol, carvedilol, and sustained-release metoprolol succinate) is recommended for all patients with current or prior symptoms of HFrEF, unless contraindicated, to reduce morbidity and mortality" with "(Class I, Level of Evidence: A)". The 2017 ACC decision pathway adds, "After a diagnosis of heart failure is made, GDMT should be initiated and therapies should be adjusted no more frequently than every 2 weeks to target doses (or maximally tolerated doses)" and "To achieve the maximal benefits of GDMT in patients with chronic HFrEF, therapies must be initiated and titrated to maximally tolerated doses".

Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Practical use of beta-blockers — initiation and maintenance in chronic heart failure (HF) states that treatment with a beta-blocker should be initiated at very low doses, followed by gradual increments in dose if lower doses have been well tolerated, and patients should be monitored closely for changes in vital signs and symptoms during this uptitration period; physicians should ask patients to weigh themselves daily and to manage any increase in weight by immediately increasing the dose of concomitantly administered diuretic until weight is restored to pretreatment levels, and planned increments in the dose of a beta-blocker should be delayed until any side effects observed with lower doses have disappeared; most patients (approximately 85%) enrolled in clinical trials were able to tolerate short- and long-term treatment and achieve the maximum planned trial dose, beta-blockers can be safely started before discharge in patients hospitalized for HF provided they do not require intravenous therapy for HF, clinical responses are generally delayed and may require 2 to 3 months to become apparent, and abrupt withdrawal can lead to clinical deterioration and should be avoided.

### 2022 AHA / ACC / HFSA guideline for the management of heart failure: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^113roJAv]. Circulation (2022). High credibility.

Beta blockers for HFrEF — In patients with HFrEF, with current or previous symptoms, use of 1 of the 3 beta blockers proven to reduce mortality (bisoprolol, carvedilol, sustained-release metoprolol succinate) is recommended to reduce mortality and hospitalizations, and beta-blocker therapy provides high economic value. Treatment with beta blockers reduces the risk of death and the combined risk of death or hospitalization in patients with HFrEF. Beta blockers should be initiated at low doses with efforts to achieve target doses as tolerated, and they can be safely started before hospital discharge when patients are clinically stabilized and do not require intravenous inotropic therapy for HF. Even if symptoms or LVEF improve, long-term treatment with target doses should be maintained to reduce risk of progression, and abrupt withdrawal should be avoided unless indicated.

### Beta-blockers and inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system for chronic heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^1156h8GZ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Beta-blockers and inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system improve survival and reduce morbidity in people with heart failure with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction. There is uncertainty whether these treatments are beneficial for people with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction and a comprehensive review of the evidence is required.

Objectives

To assess the effects of beta-blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitors, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists in people with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and two clinical trial registries on 25 July 2017 to identify eligible studies. Reference lists from primary studies and review articles were checked for additional studies. There were no language or date restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials with a parallel group design enrolling adult participants with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, defined by a left ventricular ejection fraction of greater than 40 percent.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected studies for inclusion and extracted data. The outcomes assessed included cardiovascular mortality, heart failure hospitalisation, hyperkalaemia, all-cause mortality and quality of life. Risk ratios (RR) and, where possible, hazard ratios (HR) were calculated for dichotomous outcomes. For continuous data, mean difference (MD) or standardised mean difference (SMD) were calculated. We contacted trialists where neccessary to obtain missing data.

Main Results

37 randomised controlled trials (207 reports) were included across all comparisons with a total of 18,311 participants. Ten studies (3087 participants) investigating beta-blockers (BB) were included. A pooled analysis indicated a reduction in cardiovascular mortality (15% of participants in the intervention arm versus 19% in the control arm; RR 0.78; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.62 to 0.99; number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) 25; 1046 participants; 3 studies). However, the quality of evidence was low and no effect on cardiovascular mortality was observed when the analysis was limited to studies with a low risk of bias (RR 0.81; 95% CI 0.50 to 1.29; 643 participants; 1 study). There was no effect on all-cause mortality, heart failure hospitalisation or quality of life measures, however there is uncertainty about these effects given the limited evidence available.12 studies (4408 participants) investigating mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA) were included with the quality of evidence assessed as moderate. MRA treatment reduced heart failure hospitalisation (11% of participants in the intervention arm versus 14% in the control arm; RR 0.82; 95% CI 0.69 to 0.98; NNTB 41; 3714 participants; 3 studies; moderate-quality evidence) however, little or no effect on all-cause and cardiovascular mortality and quality of life measures was observed. MRA treatment was associated with a greater risk of hyperkalaemia (16% of participants in the intervention group versus 8% in the control group; RR 2.11; 95% CI 1.77 to 2.51; 4291 participants; 6 studies; high-quality evidence). Eight studies (2061 participants) investigating angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) were included with the overall quality of evidence assessed as moderate. The evidence suggested that ACEI treatment likely has little or no effect on cardiovascular mortality, all-cause mortality, heart failure hospitalisation, or quality of life. Data for the effect of ACEI on hyperkalaemia were only available from one of the included studies. Eight studies (8755 participants) investigating angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) were included with the overall quality of evidence assessed as high. The evidence suggested that treatment with ARB has little or no effect on cardiovascular mortality, all-cause mortality, heart failure hospitalisation, or quality of life. ARB was associated with an increased risk of hyperkalaemia (0.9% of participants in the intervention group versus 0.5% in the control group; RR 1.88; 95% CI 1.07 to 3.33; 7148 participants; 2 studies; high-quality evidence). We identified a single ongoing placebo-controlled study investigating the effect of angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitors (ARNI) in people with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction.

Authors' Conclusions

There is evidence that MRA treatment reduces heart failure hospitalisation in heart failure with preserverd ejection fraction, however the effects on mortality related outcomes and quality of life remain unclear. The available evidence for beta-blockers, ACEI, ARB and ARNI is limited and it remains uncertain whether these treatments have a role in the treatment of HFpEF in the absence of an alternative indication for their use. This comprehensive review highlights a persistent gap in the evidence that is currently being addressed through several large ongoing clinical trials.

### Β-blockers in heart failure: benefits of β-blockers according to varying male proportions of study patients [^111GVQdE]. Clinical Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

In patients with heart failure (HF), b-blockers reduce mortality. It's not known whether the beneficial effects of the b-blockers were associated with the differing male proportions of study patients. It also remains to be clarified regarding the true beneficial effects of the 3 b-blockers recommended by the guideline on mortality in the real world.

Hypothesis

The benefits of b-blockers in HF patients were sex-related different.

Methods

Randomized, placebo controlled clinical trials were included if they evaluated the beneficial effects of the three b-blockers on mortality and on hospital admissions on an intention-to-treat basis, and lasted at least 3 months.

Results

Twenty-eighty trials with 14,829 patients were included. The b-blockers significantly reduced all cause mortality by 29.6%, cardiac death by 29.8%, sudden death by 49.4%, respectively. The magnitude of benefits of b-blockers in HF patients was increased with the increased male proportion. A similar magnitude of reduction in all cause mortality was observed among the three b blockers. A trend toward to reduced cardiac death was observed among the three b blockers, but only in bisoprolol was this statistically different (RR, 0.72; 95%CI, [0.59–0.87]). Metoprolol was significantly superior to carvedilol (P = 0.008) or bisoprolol (P = 0.034) in reduced sudden death.

Conclusions

In patients with HF, the 3 commonly used b-blockers significantly reduced mortality. Greater benefits of b-blockers were observed in the higher male proportion studies. The metoprolol was significantly superior to carvedilol or bisoprolol in reduced sudden death. Additional trials are required to determine whether the benefits of b-blockers will be observed in female HF patients.

Patients with chronic reduction of LVEF but no symptoms — pharmacologic prevention: Long-term treatment with an ACEI has been shown to delay the onset of HF symptoms and decrease the risk of death and hospitalization for HF in asymptomatic patients with reduced LVEF, whether due to a remote ischemic injury or to a nonischemic cardiomyopathy. Although there are no studies that specifically addressed use of ARBs in asymptomatic patients with reduced LVEF, ARBs may be an appropriate alternative, particularly in patients who cannot tolerate an ACEI. Furthermore, although controlled clinical trials are lacking, the use of beta-blockers in patients with a low EF and no symptoms (especially those with coronary artery disease) is also recommended, and the same beta-blockers should be used that were employed in the large HF trials.

Background

Beta-blockers and inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system improve survival and reduce morbidity in people with heart failure with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF); a review of the evidence is required to determine whether these treatments are beneficial for people with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF).

Objectives

To assess the effects of beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitors, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists in people with HFpEF.

Search Methods

We updated searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and one clinical trial register on 14 May 2020 to identify eligible studies, with no language or date restrictions. We checked references from trial reports and review articles for additional studies. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials with a parallel group design, enrolling adults with HFpEF, defined by LVEF greater than 40%.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.

Main Results

We included 41 randomised controlled trials (231 reports), totalling 23,492 participants across all comparisons. The risk of bias was frequently unclear and only five studies had a low risk of bias in all domains. Beta-blockers (BBs) We included 10 studies (3087 participants) investigating BBs. Five studies used a placebo comparator and in five the comparator was usual care. The mean age of participants ranged from 30 years to 81 years. A possible reduction in cardiovascular mortality was observed (risk ratio (RR) 0.78, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.62 to 0.99; number needed to treat for an additional benefit (NNTB) 25; 1046 participants; three studies), however, the certainty of evidence was low. There may be little to no effect on all-cause mortality (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.00; 1105 participants; four studies; low-certainty evidence). The effects on heart failure hospitalisation, hyperkalaemia, and quality of life remain uncertain. Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) We included 13 studies (4459 participants) investigating MRA. Eight studies used a placebo comparator and in five the comparator was usual care. The mean age of participants ranged from 54.5 to 80 years. Pooled analysis indicated that MRA treatment probably reduces heart failure hospitalisation (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.98; NNTB = 41; 3714 participants; three studies; moderate-certainty evidence). However, MRA treatment probably has little or no effect on all-cause mortality (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.06; 4207 participants; five studies; moderate-certainty evidence) and cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.11; 4070 participants; three studies; moderate-certainty evidence). MRA treatment may have little or no effect on quality of life measures (mean difference (MD) 0.84, 95% CI -2.30 to 3.98; 511 participants; three studies; low-certainty evidence). MRA treatment was associated with a higher risk of hyperkalaemia (RR 2.11, 95% CI 1.77 to 2.51; number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) = 11; 4291 participants; six studies; high-certainty evidence). Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) We included eight studies (2061 participants) investigating ACEIs. Three studies used a placebo comparator and in five the comparator was usual care. The mean age of participants ranged from 70 to 82 years. Pooled analyses with moderate-certainty evidence suggest that ACEI treatment likely has little or no effect on cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.42; 945 participants; two studies), all-cause mortality (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.45; 1187 participants; five studies) and heart failure hospitalisation (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.15; 1019 participants; three studies), and may result in little or no effect on the quality of life (MD -0.09, 95% CI -3.66 to 3.48; 154 participants; two studies; low-certainty evidence). The effects on hyperkalaemia remain uncertain. Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) Eight studies (8755 participants) investigating ARBs were included. Five studies used a placebo comparator and in three the comparator was usual care. The mean age of participants ranged from 61 to 75 years. Pooled analyses with high certainty of evidence suggest that ARB treatment has little or no effect on cardiovascular mortality (RR 1.02, 95% 0.90 to 1.14; 7254 participants; three studies), all-cause mortality (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.11; 7964 participants; four studies), heart failure hospitalisation (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.02; 7254 participants; three studies), and quality of life (MD 0.41, 95% CI -0.86 to 1.67; 3117 participants; three studies). ARB was associated with a higher risk of hyperkalaemia (RR 1.88, 95% CI 1.07 to 3.33; 7148 participants; two studies; high-certainty evidence). Angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitors (ARNIs) Three studies (7702 participants) investigating ARNIs were included. Two studies used ARBs as the comparator and one used standardised medical therapy, based on participants' established treatments at enrolment. The mean age of participants ranged from 71 to 73 years. Results suggest that ARNIs may have little or no effect on cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.15; 4796 participants; one study; moderate-certainty evidence), all-cause mortality (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.11; 7663 participants; three studies; high-certainty evidence), or quality of life (high-certainty evidence). However, ARNI treatment may result in a slight reduction in heart failure hospitalisation, compared to usual care (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.00; 7362 participants; two studies; moderate-certainty evidence). ARNI treatment was associated with a reduced risk of hyperkalaemia compared with valsartan (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.01; 5054 participants; two studies; moderate-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

There is evidence that MRA and ARNI treatment in HFpEF probably reduces heart failure hospitalisation but probably has little or no effect on cardiovascular mortality and quality of life. BB treatment may reduce the risk of cardiovascular mortality, however, further trials are needed. The current evidence for BBs, ACEIs, and ARBs is limited and does not support their use in HFpEF in the absence of an alternative indication. Although MRAs and ARNIs are probably effective at reducing the risk of heart failure hospitalisation, the treatment effect sizes are modest. There is a need for improved approaches to patient stratification to identify the subgroup of patients who are most likely to benefit from MRAs and ARNIs, as well as for an improved understanding of disease biology, and for new therapeutic approaches.

### The new heart failure guidelines: strategies for implementation [^115b6ubi]. American Heart Journal (2007). Low credibility.

Several life-prolonging therapies are available for the treatment of heart failure, yet they are underutilized in many patients. A treatment gap exists between patients who are eligible for a therapy and the number of patients who actually receive them. Suboptimal prescribing rates for angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, beta-blockers, and aldosterone antagonists have been reported. Strategies are needed to increase the proportion of patients who are receiving evidence-based therapies. Predischarge initiation of evidence-based therapies has effectively increased utilization in the acute coronary syndrome population. Predischarge initiation of beta-blockade in patients hospitalized for heart failure has also been shown to be safe and effective for improving beta-blocker use at 60 days. Larger registry initiatives have demonstrated improved use of evidence-based therapies associated with implementation of a performance improvement process system. The mortality and morbidity associated with heart failure is strikingly high, and it is critical that proven therapies are prescribed to all eligible patients so that clinical outcomes can be improved. Systematic processes are effective approaches to ensuring appropriate evidence-based therapies are prescribed in most patients.

### Practical guidelines to optimize effectiveness of β-blockade in patients postinfarction and in those with chronic heart failure [^114UL57Z]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2004). Low credibility.

Antiadrenergic therapy reduces the risks of death and major morbidity in patients postinfarction and in those with chronic heart failure. Despite the common perception, these benefits are not attributable to a class effect, and clinical trials reveal evidence of specific agents that provide clinical advantages. To optimize patient outcome in the postinfarction setting, propranolol or timolol should be used in the setting of preserved ventricular function, and carvedilol should be used in patients with impaired ventricular function, with or without clinical evidence of heart failure. Patients with chronic heart failure are at lower risk of death when treated with carvedilol, which is also associated with a lower incidence of developing diabetes mellitus-related adverse events. This article reviews the scientific evidence for the hierarchy of antiadrenergic agents and addresses practical issues associated with initiation of therapy and long-term management.

### 2022 AHA / ACC / HFSA guideline for the management of heart failure: executive summary: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^114o8xWv]. Circulation (2022). High credibility.

Pre–heart failure (stage B) management to prevent clinical heart failure focuses on disease-modifying therapies and device prevention at specific left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) thresholds. In patients with LVEF ≤ 40%, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) should be used to prevent symptomatic HF and reduce mortality. In patients with a recent or remote history of myocardial infarction or acute coronary syndrome, statins should be used to prevent symptomatic HF and adverse cardiovascular events. In patients with a recent myocardial infarction and LVEF ≤ 40% who are intolerant to ACEI, angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) should be used to prevent symptomatic HF and reduce mortality. In patients with a recent or remote history of myocardial infarction or acute coronary syndrome and LVEF ≤ 40%, evidence-based beta blockers should be used to reduce mortality. In patients who are at least 40 days post–myocardial infarction with LVEF ≤ 30% and New York Heart Association (NYHA) class I symptoms while receiving GDMT and have reasonable expectation of meaningful survival for > 1 year, an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator is recommended for primary prevention of sudden cardiac death to reduce total mortality. In patients with LVEF ≤ 40%, beta blockers should be used to prevent symptomatic HF. In patients with LVEF < 50%, thiazolidinediones should not be used because they increase the risk of HF, including hospitalizations. In patients with LVEF < 50%, nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers with negative inotropic effects may be harmful.

Beta-blockers

Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction

Several landmark RCTs demonstrated significant mortality benefit with the use of beta-blockers in HFrEF. Seventeen non-randomized studies reported 18 estimates of beta-blocker 'treatment-effect'. Sixteen of these suggested beta-blocker use was associated with a lower mortality, and two did not, (Table 3).

Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction

The effect of beta-blockers on mortality was examined in one small randomized trialand a pre-specified subgroup analysis of a randomized trial which included patients with both HFrEF and HFpEF. Overall, we identified 13 non-randomized studies of beta-blockers in HFpEF, of which nine reported an association between beta-blocker use and better survival, whereas four did not, (Table 3).

Mixed/unspecified heart failure phenotype

One moderately large RCT evaluated the effects of nebivolol in patients with both HFrEF and HFpEF, demonstrating a neutral effect on mortality. We identified 17 observational studies reporting 19 estimates of the 'effect' of treatment, with 17 suggesting benefit, and two reporting no difference in outcome between those treated with and not treated with a beta-blocker(Table 3).

Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists

Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction

Two pivotal RCTs in HFrEF demonstrated the mortality and hospitalization benefits of MRAs. In contrast, of 12 non-randomized studies only one concluded MRAs were of benefit, with 10 finding a neutral effect, and one suggesting a harmful effect(Table 4).

Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction

One large RCT showed no effect of spironolactone on mortality in patients with HFpEF. Two observational studies also found a neutral effect, but a further non-randomized study reported an association between MRA use and lower mortality(Table 4).

Mixed/unspecified heart failure phenotype

Of five studies of patients with a mixed HF phenotype, two suggested benefit, and three reported a neutral effect, (Table 4).

Evidence in favor of beta-blocker treatment in HFpEF

Most patients (55%–87%) enrolled in HFpEF RCTs used open-label beta-blocker therapy despite sparse trial evidenceand mostly as background therapy for concomitant cardiovascular conditions with high heart rate, such as hypertension, ischemic heart disease, or atrial fibrillation. Therefore, designing prospective RCTs in HFpEF with no beta-blocker use in the placebo arm is virtually impossible.

The SENIORS trial with nebivololincluded HF patients not based on LVEF and demonstrated a beneficial beta-blocker effect independent of LVEF in a prespecified subgroup analysis. The effect on the composite primary outcome of all-cause mortality or cardiovascular hospital admission showed an overall HR of 0.86, and in the subgroup possessing LVEF ≥ 35%, HR was 0.82. Apart from this single RCT, the published literature in HFmrEF or HFpEF patients is based on observational cohorts, on which meta-analyses have also been made. An example is a meta-analysis on beta-blockers in HFmrEF and HFpEF (LVEF > 40%), which revealed that beta-blocker use was associated with reduced risk of mortality. Beta-blockers also have beneficial effects in HFpEF patients who are in sinus rhythm. A specific reason for the beneficial role of beta-blockers in HFpEF beyond their beneficial effects in patients with the concomitant diseases mentioned above is the increased sympathetic activity in this form of HF, whether patients have obesity or not. Another interesting aspect of assessing beta-blockers in HF is their effect on increasing natriuretic peptide (NP) concentrations, likely because of their heart rate-reducing properties. Thus, although beta-blockers continue to be a major therapy in patients with HFrEF, documented for bisoprolol, carvedilol, metoprolol, and nebivolol, it is unclear how the increase in NPs contributes to their benefits and whether NPs can be used for monitoring HF progression during beta-blocker treatment.

### Heart failure drug treatment [^1113JZUw]. Lancet (2019). Excellent credibility.

Heart failure is the most common cardiovascular reason for hospital admission for people older than 60 years of age. Few areas in medicine have progressed as remarkably as heart failure treatment over the past three decades. However, progress has been consistent only for chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. In acutely decompensated heart failure and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, none of the treatments tested to date have been definitively proven to improve survival. Delaying or preventing heart failure has become increasingly important in patients who are prone to heart failure. The prevention of worsening chronic heart failure and hospitalisations for acute decompensation is also of great importance. The objective of this Series paper is to provide a concise and practical summary of the available drug treatments for heart failure. We support the implementation of the international guidelines. We offer views on the basis of our personal experience in research areas that have insufficient evidence. The best possible evidence-based drug treatment (including inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and β blockers) is useful only when optimally implemented. However, implementation might be challenging. We believe that disease management programmes can be helpful in providing a multidisciplinary, holistic approach to the delivery of optimal medical care.

Prevention of cardiovascular events — acute MI and history of MI with normal LVEF: In patients with an acute MI, the infusion of a fibrinolytic agent or the use of percutaneous coronary intervention can decrease the risk of developing HF, and patients also benefit from both a beta-blocker and either an ACEI or ARB, which can decrease the risk of reinfarction or death when initiated within days after the ischemic event; combined neurohormonal blockade produces additive benefits. In patients with a history of MI but normal LVEF, both hypertension and hyperlipidemia should be treated vigorously, patients with a recent MI should also receive ACEIs and beta-blockers to reduce death risk, and evidence from 2 large-scale studies indicates that prolonged ACEI therapy can reduce major cardiovascular events even when started months or years after MI.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) and beta-blocker initiation — refractory heart failure (HF): treatment with either type of drug should not be initiated in patients who have systolic blood pressures less than 80 mm Hg or who have signs of peripheral hypoperfusion, and patients should not be started on a beta-blocker if they have significant fluid retention or if they recently required treatment with an intravenous positive inotropic agent. Treatment with an ACEI or beta-blocker should be initiated in very low doses, and patients should be monitored closely for signs or symptoms of intolerance, and clinical trials suggest that even low doses may provide important benefits. For patients who cannot tolerate ACEIs or beta-blockers, a combination of nitrates and hydralazine has been reported to have favorable effects on survival in mild to moderate symptoms not taking an ACEI or beta-blocker. Spironolactone has been reported to prolong life and reduce HF hospitalization in advanced disease, but the evidence was derived in patients with preserved renal function, and the drug can produce dangerous hyperkalemia in impaired renal function. Although angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are frequently considered as alternatives to ACEIs because of the low incidence of cough and angioedema, it is not clear that ARBs are as effective as ACEIs, and they are as likely as ACEIs to produce hypotension or renal insufficiency.

Pharmacological interventions for heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction

Pharmacological treatment for HFrEF is well established. Beta-adrenoceptor blockers, RAAS inhibitors, and mineralocorticoid receptor blockers can reduce morbidity and mortality in HFrEF patients. Large-scale clinical trials have been instituted to identify effective drugs based on the risk factors for HFpEF –, some of which are ongoing.

The beta (β)-adrenergic system is primarily located in the heart (β1) and smooth muscle (β2). When endogenous catecholamines activate the β1 signaling cascade, the heart contracts more rapidly and forcefully. However, aberrant activation of the neurohormonal system worsens cardiac remodeling in HFrEF, implying that β-adrenergic blockage is beneficial. The β-blockers allow the heart to rest through a significant reduction in cardiac load. Various studies using β-blockers have been conducted using different patient enrollment criteria. However, the overall outcome of β-blocker trials revealed no survival benefit for HFpEF patients. HFmrEF patients showed better survival than HFpEF patients with β-blocker treatment.

Treatment of stage A heart failure should focus on reducing modifiable risk factors, including management of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. To prevent symptomatic heart failure, ACE inhibitors and beta blockers should be used in all patients with stage B or C heart failure who have a reduced ejection fraction. Patients with stage C heart failure and fluid retention should be treated with diuretics in addition to ACE inhibitors and beta blockers.

### Prognostic benefit of β-blockers in patients not receiving ACE-inhibitors [^117E4Awi]. European Heart Journal (2005). Low credibility.

Aims

Beta-blockers (BBs) confer significant prognostic benefit in patients (pts) with systolic chronic heart failure (CHF). However, major trials have thus far studied BBs mainly in addition to ACE-Inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) as background therapy. The magnitude of the prognostic benefit of BBs in the absence of ACE-I or ARB has not as yet been determined.

Methods and Results

We performed a meta-analysis of all placebo-controlled BB studies in patients with CHF (n > 200). Trials were identified via Medline literature searches, meeting abstracts, and contact with study organizations. Results for all-cause mortality and death or heart failure hospitalization were pooled using the Mantel-Haenszel (fixed effects) method. The impact of BB therapy on all-cause mortality in CHF, in the absence (4.8%) and presence (95.2%) of ACE-I (or ARB), was determined from six trials of 13 370 patients. The risk ratio (RR) for BBs vs. placebo was 0.73 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.53–1.02] in the absence of ACE-I or ARB at baseline, compared with a RR of 0.76 (95% CI 0.71–0.83) in the presence of these agents. When ACE-Inhibitors were analysed in the same way (pre-BB), a RR of 0.89 (0.80–0.99) vs. placebo was observed in studies of > 90 days. The impact of BB therapy on death or HF hospitalization in systolic CHF, in the absence and presence of ACE-I, was determined from three trials of 8988 patients. The RR for BBs vs. placebo was 0.81 (95% CI 0.61–1.08) in the absence of ACE-I or ARB at baseline, compared with a RR of 0.78 (95% CI 0.74–0.83) in the presence of these agents. When ACE-Is were analysed in the same way (pre-BB), a RR of 0.85 (95% CI 0.78–0.93) vs. placebo was observed in studies of > 90 days.

Conclusion

The magnitude of the prognostic benefit conferred by BBs in the absence of ACE-I appears to be similar to those of ACE-Is in systolic CHF. These data therefore suggest that either ACE-Is or BBs could be used as first-line neurohormonal therapy in patients with systolic CHF. Prospective studies directly comparing these agents are required to definitively address this issue.

### American college of cardiology / American Heart Association chronic heart failure evaluation and management guidelines: relevance to the geriatric practice [^115yovp1]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Heart failure (HF) is the only cardiovascular disease with increasing incidence and prevalence. Most HF patients are older adults. With the aging of the population and effective treatment of hypertension and coronary artery disease, the two major underlying causes of HF, the number of older Americans with HF is expected to rise significantly in the coming decades. HF is the number one hospital discharge diagnosis for older adults. It is one of the causes of frequent hospital readmissions, reflecting acute decompensation and compromised quality of life for patients and increased cost and resource use for the healthcare system. It is also associated with approximately 300,000 deaths annually, most in older adults. Advances in the management of HF in the past several decades have significantly decreased the mortality and morbidity associated with this condition. Randomized controlled trials have demonstrated the beneficial effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, beta-blockers, and spironolactone on survival and quality of life of HF patients, but there is evidence of underuse of evidence-based care for HF. Several national guidelines have been published since 1994 that recommended evidence-based evaluation and management of HF. In 1995, the American College of Cardiologists (ACC) and the American Heart Association (AHA) published their first HF guidelines that recommended left ventricular (LV) function evaluation for all patients presenting with HF and use of ACE inhibitors for all patients with LV systolic dysfunction (LVSD) unless contraindicated. The guidelines recommended the use of hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate in patients who could not use ACE inhibitors. In addition, digoxin was recommended in patients with HF due to LVSD but not adequately responsive to ACE inhibitors and diuretics and in those with atrial fibrillation and rapid ventricular rates. Diuretic use was recommended for symptomatic patients with evidence of fluid overload. Use of anticoagulation was restricted to patients with atrial fibrillation or to those with a history of systemic or pulmonary embolism. Beta-blockers were reserved for HF patients after acute myocardial infarctions. Recent advances in the management of HF called for a revision of the guidelines.

Purpose

The purpose of revising the 1995 ACC/AHA guidelines was to incorporate recent advances in pharmacological and nonpharmacological approaches to HF treatment and to assist physicians in clinical decision-making in the management of HF.

Methods

The ACC/AHA invited representatives from the American College of Chest Physicians, the Heart Failure Society of America, the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation, the American Academy of Family Physicians, and the American College of Physicians-American Society of Internal Medicine to participate in the preparation of the guidelines. The writing committee searched pertinent medical literature in English using computerized databases such as MEDLINE and EMBASE and manually searching the bibliographies of the selected articles. The writing committee classified HF into four stages, including patients who are at high risk for developing HF. According to this new classification, Stage A and B represent asymptomatic patients, the former at high risk for developing HF but no structural disorder, the latter with structural disorders of the heart. Stage C encompasses patients with underlying structural heart disorders who are symptomatic, either currently or in the past. Stage D includes end-stage HF patients. This new classification is intended to complement the New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional classification of HF into Class I (asymptomatic), Class II (symptomatic on less than ordinary exertion), Class III (symptomatic on ordinary exertion), and Class IV (symptomatic at rest).

Results

The recommendations are categorized into those for evaluation and management.

### Beta-blocker efficacy across different cardiovascular indications: an umbrella review and meta-analytic assessment [^113H9m2z]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This umbrella review across cardiovascular indications used meta-analytic data to clarify the evidence basis for beta-blockers in contemporary clinical practice (Table 1, Fig. 5). In patients with coronary disease, there is a trade-off between benefit and risk. Beta-blockers reduced the risk of incident MI at the expense of higher rates of incident HF, with no effect on mortality. In patients with HFrEF in sinus rhythm, beta-blockers reduced morbidity and mortality, but they had no effect in HFrEF with concomitant atrial fibrillation or those with preserved LVEF. In perioperative patients, although beta-blockers reduced the risk of incident MI in those undergoing non-cardiac surgery, this was at the expense of increased mortality and stroke. Beta-blockers had no effect on any of the outcomes assessed in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. In hypertension, although beta-blockers had no significant effect compared to placebo or diuretics, they were inferior to RAS antagonists and CCB. These findings highlight the importance of an individualised assessment of indication, comorbidity and understanding of the goal of therapy before routine commencement of beta-blockers.

### Comparison of the beneficial effect of β-blockers on mortality in patients with ischaemic or non-ischaemic systolic heart failure: a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^114Bskx1]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2007). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Mechanisms by which beta-blockers bring benefit may differ according to the aetiology of heart failure (HF). It is uncertain whether the magnitude of the benefit of beta-blockers is the same in ischaemic or non-ischaemic HF.

Methods

We performed a systematic review of all randomised, placebo-controlled, parallel-design trials of beta-blockers in HF that collected data on mortality during follow-up.

Results

Among 26 randomised trials comparing beta-blockers with placebo in HF, 4 studies with 7250 patients provided information on the number of patients who died during follow-up in subgroups of ischaemic and non-ischaemic aetiology of HF. Two studies were performed with bisoprolol, one with carvedilol and one with metoprolol. HF was associated with ischaemic aetiology in 4746/7250 patients (65%) and non-ischaemic aetiology in 2504/7250 patients (35%). Mortality occurred in 301 patients. The risk ratio (RR) for beta-blockers versus placebo was 0.62 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.52–0.75, p < 0.00001) in ischaemic HF, compared with a RR of 0.62 (95% CI 0.45–0.84, p = 0.002) in the presence of non-ischaemic HF.

Conclusion

The magnitude of the prognostic benefit conferred by beta-blockers for overall mortality in non-ischaemic HF appears to be very similar to that in ischaemic HF.

Regarding medical management for heart failure, more specifically with respect to management of HFmrEF, ACC/AHA/HFSA 2022 guidelines recommend to consider initiating the following agents in patients with current or previous symptomatic HFmrEF (LVEF 41–49%) to reduce the risk of HF hospitalization and cardiovascular mortality, particularly among patients with LVEF on the lower end of this spectrum:

- evidence-based β-blockers for HFrEF

### The effects of β-blockers on morbidity and mortality in a population-based cohort of 11, 942 elderly patients with heart failure [^113D8fAS]. The American Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Purpose

Randomized trials have shown that beta-blockers prevent morbidity and mortality in heart failure. However, whether beta-blockers are effective in older patients or those with conditions that would have led to their exclusion from these trials remains unclear.

Subjects and Methods

The associations between beta-blocker use and outcomes were examined in a population-based cohort of 11,942 older (age ≥ 65 years) patients with incident heart failure between 1994 and 1999. Cox proportional hazards models were used to adjust for propensity scores, age, sex, comorbid conditions, and other medications.

Results

The mean (± SD) age of the patients was 79 ± 8 years, 5819 (49%) were men, and 2569 (22%) had Charlson comorbidity scores of at least 2. During follow-up (median, 21 months), 3539 patients were hospitalized for heart failure and 6757 died. Overall, 1162 patients received beta-blockers. After adjustment, beta-blocker use was associated with substantial reductions in all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.72; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.65 to 0.80), mortality due to heart failure (HR = 0.65; 95% CI: 0.47 to 0.90), and hospitalizations for heart failure (HR = 0.82; 95% CI: 0.74 to 0.92). These endpoints were less frequent in patients treated with beta-blockers than in untreated patients in all examined subgroups. All doses of beta-blockers were associated with benefit, but there was a trend towards greater benefit in patients prescribed higher doses.

Conclusions

The benefits of beta-blockers seen in randomized trials extend to older patients and to those with conditions that would have led to their exclusion from the trials. There is a need for a randomized trial comparing different doses of beta-blockers in heart failure.

### Influence of global region on outcomes in heart failure β-blocker trials [^113SmBRP]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2011). Low credibility.

Objectives

We sought to describe the United States and the rest of the world (ROW) outcomes from the major β-blocker heart failure (HF) trials.

Background

HF trials have demonstrated differences in outcomes by geographic region.

Methods

Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies that evaluated β-blockers in HF patients, had a primary endpoint of mortality, and enrolled U.S. patients were included. Relative risk (RR) was calculated for patients enrolled in the United States and ROW. Meta-analysis of the combined mortality rates was performed using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel statistic, stratified by study.

Results

A total of 8,988 patients were enrolled in the MERIT-HF (Metoprolol Controlled-Release Randomized Intervention Trial in Heart Failure), COPERNICUS (Carvedilol Prospective Randomized Cumulative Survival trial), and BEST (β-Blocker Evaluation of Survival Trial) combined; 4,198 (46.7%) were from the United States. In the U.S. cohort, the RR reduction for each β-blocker was of smaller magnitude than in the overall cohort and no longer significant, whereas in the ROW subgroup, the mortality benefit for β-blockade persisted. In the pooled analysis (n = 11,635), the RR of death was reduced by 23% (p < 0.001) with β-blockade compared with placebo. In contrast, the mortality reduction associated with β-blockade in the U.S. cohort was small and not statistically significant (RR: 0.92, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.82 to 1.02, p = 0.11). The survival benefit persisted in the ROW cohort (RR: 0.64, 95% CI: 0.56 to 0.72, p < 0.001).

Conclusions

Among patients enrolled in the United States, β-blockade was associated with a lower magnitude of survival benefit, whereas the ROW response was similar to the total study population. This geographic difference in treatment response may be a reflection of population differences, genetics, cultural or social differences in disease management, or low power and statistical chance.

Heart failure with mildly reduced ejection fraction (HFmrEF) — evidence for other guideline-directed therapies: Post hoc and subsets of analyses of HFrEF trials that included HFmrEF (LVEF 41%–49%) have suggested benefit from use of GDMT for HFrEF. The BBmeta-HF meta-analysis of 11 heart failure trials found that, in a subgroup of 575 patients with LVEF 40% to 49% in sinus rhythm, beta blockers reduced the primary outcome of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. In a subgroup analysis of PARAGON-HF for patients with LVEF 45% to 57% (lower range of EF in the trial), sacubitril-valsartan versus valsartan alone suggested benefit with a rate ratio of 0.78 (95% CI, 0.64–0.95).

Stage B (patients with pre-HF) — preventing clinical heart failure (HF) recommendations include: In patients with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤ 40%, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) should be used to prevent symptomatic HF and reduce mortality (Class 1, Level A). In patients with a recent or remote history of myocardial infarction (MI) or acute coronary syndrome (ACS), statins should be used to prevent symptomatic HF and adverse cardiovascular events (Class 1, Level A). In patients with a recent MI and LVEF ≤ 40% who are intolerant to ACEI, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) should be used to prevent symptomatic HF and reduce mortality (Class 1, Level B-R). In patients with a recent or remote history of MI or ACS and LVEF ≤ 40%, evidence-based beta blockers should be used to reduce mortality (Class 1, Level B-R). In patients who are at least 40 days post-MI with LVEF ≤ 30% and New York Heart Association (NYHA) class I symptoms while receiving guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) and have reasonable expectation of meaningful survival for > 1 year, an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) is recommended for primary prevention of sudden cardiac death (SCD) to reduce total mortality (Class 1, Level B-R). In patients with LVEF ≤ 40%, beta blockers should be used to prevent symptomatic HF (Class 1, Level C-LD). In patients with LVEF ≤ 50%, thiazolidinediones should not be used because they increase the risk of HF, including hospitalizations (Class 3: Harm, Level B-R). In patients with LVEF < 50%, nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers with negative inotropic effects may be harmful (Class 3: Harm, Level C-LD).

### Carvedilol in the failing heart [^1173xHAP]. Clinical Cardiology (2001). Low credibility.

Patients with chronic heart failure due to left ventricular systolic dysfunction of ischemic or nonischemic etiology have shown improvement in morbidity and mortality with carvedilol therapy. In patients with symptomatic (New York Heart Association class II-IV) heart failure, carvedilol improves left ventricular ejection fraction and clinical status, and slows disease progression, reducing the combined risk of mortality and hospitalization. Despite the overwhelming evidence for their benefit, there continues to be a large treatment gap between those who would derive benefit and those who actually receive the drug. In this article, the pharmacology, clinical trial evidence, and the potential differences between carvedilol and other beta blockers are discussed. Carvedilol provides powerful therapy in the treatment of chronic heart failure caused by a variety of etiologies and in a wide array of clinical settings.

### Beta-blockers for hypertension [^116ekrY6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Beta-blockers refer to a mixed group of drugs with diverse pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties. They have shown long-term beneficial effects on mortality and cardiovascular disease (CVD) when used in people with heart failure or acute myocardial infarction. Beta-blockers were thought to have similar beneficial effects when used as first-line therapy for hypertension. However, the benefit of beta-blockers as first-line therapy for hypertension without compelling indications is controversial. This review is an update of a Cochrane Review initially published in 2007 and updated in 2012.

Objectives

To assess the effects of beta-blockers on morbidity and mortality endpoints in adults with hypertension.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomized controlled trials up to June 2016: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2016, Issue 6), MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), and ClinicalTrials.gov. We checked reference lists of relevant reviews, and reference lists of studies potentially eligible for inclusion in this review, and also searched the the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform on 06 July 2015.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of at least one year of duration, which assessed the effects of beta-blockers compared to placebo or other drugs, as first-line therapy for hypertension, on mortality and morbidity in adults.

Data Collection and Analysis

We selected studies and extracted data in duplicate, resolving discrepancies by consensus. We expressed study results as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and conducted fixed-effect or random-effects meta-analyses, as appropriate. We also used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. GRADE classifies the certainty of evidence as high (if we are confident that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of effect), moderate (if the true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of effect), low (if the true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of effect), and very low (if we are very uncertain about the estimate of effect).

Main Results

Thirteen RCTs met inclusion criteria. They compared beta-blockers to placebo (4 RCTs, 23,613 participants), diuretics (5 RCTs, 18,241 participants), calcium-channel blockers (CCBs: 4 RCTs, 44,825 participants), and renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors (3 RCTs, 10,828 participants). These RCTs were conducted between the 1970s and 2000s and most of them had a high risk of bias resulting from limitations in study design, conduct, and data analysis. There were 40,245 participants taking beta-blockers, three-quarters of them taking atenolol. We found no outcome trials involving the newer vasodilating beta-blockers (e.g. nebivolol). There was no difference in all-cause mortality between beta-blockers and placebo (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.11), diuretics or RAS inhibitors, but it was higher for beta-blockers compared to CCBs (RR 1.07, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.14). The evidence on mortality was of moderate-certainty for all comparisons. Total CVD was lower for beta-blockers compared to placebo (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.79 to 0.97; low-certainty evidence), a reflection of the decrease in stroke (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.96; low-certainty evidence) since there was no difference in coronary heart disease (CHD: RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.07; moderate-certainty evidence). The effect of beta-blockers on CVD was worse than that of CCBs (RR 1.18, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.29; moderate-certainty evidence), but was not different from that of diuretics (moderate-certainty) or RAS inhibitors (low-certainty). In addition, there was an increase in stroke in beta-blockers compared to CCBs (RR 1.24, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.40; moderate-certainty evidence) and RAS inhibitors (RR 1.30, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.53; moderate-certainty evidence). However, there was little or no difference in CHD between beta-blockers and diuretics (low-certainty evidence), CCBs (moderate-certainty evidence) or RAS inhibitors (low-certainty evidence). In the single trial involving participants aged 65 years and older, atenolol was associated with an increased CHD incidence compared to diuretics (RR 1.63, 95% CI 1.15 to 2.32). Participants taking beta-blockers were more likely to discontinue treatment due to adverse events than participants taking RAS inhibitors (RR 1.41, 95% CI 1.29 to 1.54; moderate-certainty evidence), but there was little or no difference with placebo, diuretics or CCBs (low-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Most outcome RCTs on beta-blockers as initial therapy for hypertension have high risk of bias. Atenolol was the beta-blocker most used. Current evidence suggests that initiating treatment of hypertension with beta-blockers leads to modest CVD reductions and little or no effects on mortality. These beta-blocker effects are inferior to those of other antihypertensive drugs. Further research should be of high quality and should explore whether there are differences between different subtypes of beta-blockers or whether beta-blockers have differential effects on younger and older people.

### Heart failure due to reduced ejection fraction: medical management [^111idw9G]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Heart failure is an increasingly common condition resulting in high rates of morbidity and mortality. For patients who have heart failure and reduced ejection fraction, randomized clinical trials demonstrate consistent mortality benefit from angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, direct-acting vasodilators, beta blockers, and aldosterone antagonists. Additionally, some data show benefits from two new classes of drugs: angiotensin receptor blocker/neprilysin inhibitor and sinus node modulator. Diuretics and digoxin can be used as needed for symptom control. Statins are not recommended solely for treatment of heart failure. Implantable cardioverter-defibrillators and biventricular pacemakers improve mortality and function in selected patients. For patients who have been hospitalized for heart failure, disease management programs and telemonitoring can reduce hospitalizations and mortality.

Many drugs that antagonize endogenous neurohormonal systems reduce the risk of death in patients with heart failure and a reduced ejection fraction. Importantly, the magnitude of the survival benefit with each agent has not been influenced by concomitant treatment with other life-prolonging drugs. In the post-infarction patient, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors decreased the mortality rate in patients already receiving beta-blockers. Conversely, in patients with established heart failure due to systolic dysfunction, beta-blockers reduced the risk of death in patients already receiving ACE inhibitors. The mortality reduction with mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists in an early trial where few patients were treated with a beta-blocker was similar to that seen in a later trial where most patients were receiving a beta-blocker. In subgroup analyses of clinical trials, the survival benefits of a neurohormonal antagonist have not been meaningfully affected by the intensity of use of other important treatments for heart failure.

The concept that each neurohormonal antagonist exerts favourable effects that are independent of the benefits of other treatments is critically important to physicians. In clinical practice, most patients with heart failure and a reduced ejection fraction are treated with only a conventional inhibitor of the renin–angiotensin system and a beta-blocker, often in doses that are much smaller than the target doses that were effective in large-scale clinical trials. Presumably, some practitioners believe that such limited neurohormonal antagonism is sufficient, perhaps based on an assumption that a combination of an ACE inhibitor and a beta-blocker achieves adequate normalization of the neurohormonal environment. However, this belief is not supported by the available evidence. The addition of a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist and a neprilysin inhibitor to an ACE inhibitor and a beta-blocker leads to a further substantial reduction in the risk of death; modelling estimates suggest that mortality can be reduced by an additional 40–50% with more comprehensive neurohormonal blockade.

Advanced heart failure (HF) — utilization of neurohormonal inhibitors notes that controlled trials suggest that patients with advanced HF respond favorably to treatment with both ACEIs and beta-blockers in a manner similar to those with mild to moderate disease. Because neurohormonal mechanisms support circulatory homeostasis as HF progresses, neurohormonal antagonists may be less well tolerated by patients with severe symptoms than by patients with mild symptoms. Patients who are at the end stage of their disease are at particular risk of developing hypotension and renal insufficiency after the administration of an ACEI and of experiencing worsening HF after treatment with a beta-blocker, and as a result, patients with refractory HF may tolerate only small doses of these neurohormonal antagonists or may not tolerate them at all.

Heart failure — race‑related trial representation and therapy response notes underrepresentation, no justified deviation from standard care, and differential observations with ACE inhibitors and beta‑blockers. Blacks and other racial minorities with HF are underrepresented in most clinical trials of HF, and to date, there are no data to suggest that any significant treatment variance from standard care for HF should be acceptable in any particular group. Clinical experience suggests that Asian patients have a higher than average risk of cough during treatment with an ACEI, and retrospective analyses suggest black patients with HF may experience less efficacy than nonblacks from ACEIs. A matched‑cohort analysis confirmed greater numbers of HF hospitalizations in black versus matched white patients, with similar rates of death between black and nonblack patients. In beta‑blocker trials, bucindolol caused a nonsignificant increase in the risk of a serious clinical event in black patients but reduced deaths and hospitalizations in nonblack patients, whereas the benefit of carvedilol was apparent and of a similar magnitude in both black and nonblack patients with HF.

### Race and beta-blocker survival benefit in patients with heart failure: an investigation of self-reported race and proportion of African genetic ancestry [^1116p4JV]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

The landmark clinical trials that established the efficacy of beta‐blockers in patients with heart failure (HF) with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) predominately consisted of white patients (80–99%), 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 despite evidence that black patients have higher risk for developing and dying from HF. 7 Subgroup analyses of these pivotal trials show effect estimates that are consistent with treatment benefit across races (though very limited in terms of power), 8, 9 and consensus guidelines reasonably recommend beta‐blocker use in all patients with HFrEF unless contraindicated. 10 The extrapolation of clinical trial data from 1 patient race to another is an important issue because at least 29 medications (including beta‐blockers) are reported to have racial disparities in safety or efficacy, 11 and this is clearly salient in the setting of HF. 12 BEST (Beta Blocker Evaluation of Survival trial), which tested bucindolol in chronic HFrEF patients, showed differing effects depending on race with a trend toward harm among black patients. 13, 14 Moreover, some observational data sets have suggested reduced efficacy of approved beta‐blockers in black HFrEF patients. 15, 16

Objective

To review the literature assessing the differences in response to angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and beta-blockers in black patients compared with the response in non-black patients in the management of systolic heart failure.

Data Sources

A MEDLINE search (January 1966-May 2001) was performed using heart failure, blacks, Negroid race, adrenergic beta-antagonists, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors as key words. English-language articles were identified. Additional pertinent articles were identified from review of the references of these articles.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All identified references were reviewed. All articles deemed relevant to the subject of this article were included.

Data Synthesis

It has been suggested that the antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers may be less in black patients than in other racial groups. Retrospective reanalyses of major heart failure trials have suggested that black patients may not realize a significant benefit in morbidity or mortality when heart failure is managed with ACE inhibitors or beta-blockers. It has also been suggested that black patients may respond more favorably than non-black patients to the combination of hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate.

Conclusions

Published reanalyses of ACE inhibitor and beta-blocker trials in heart failure provide weak data to support a lack of benefit in black patients. The published literature on this topic is limited by its retrospective nature. Firm conclusions regarding the influence of race on effectiveness of ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers cannot be made until prospective trials, with planned analysis of the effect of race, have been performed.

### Managing the patient with diabetes mellitus and heart failure: issues and considerations [^113sx9d8]. The American Journal of Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Heart failure affects nearly 5 million Americans and is associated with high morbidity and mortality rates. It is now recognized that activation of multiple neurohormonal systems is intrinsic in the pathophysiology of heart failure. Patients with diabetes mellitus are at high risk for heart failure, and some of the complications of diabetes (e.g., insulin resistance) contribute to the development and progression of heart failure, partly because of their effects on neurohormonal systems. Pharmacologic intervention directed toward these systems (i.e., angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE] inhibition, use of aldosterone antagonists, and beta-adrenergic blockade) has been shown to decrease the morbidity and mortality associated with heart failure. Despite this knowledge, ACE inhibitors, aldosterone antagonists, and beta-blockers are grossly underused, and deaths and hospitalizations due to heart failure have steadily increased. Guidelines for the management of heart failure recommend the use of ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers in patients with mild, moderate, or severe disease. Aldosterone antagonists are recommended in severe heart failure, and recent data also support their use in mild to moderate heart failure. Concerns about the increased incidence of hypoglycemia, worsening dyslipidemia, and decreased insulin sensitivity with beta-blocker use may be preventing physicians from prescribing these agents for patients with diabetes with heart failure. Although evidence from earlier clinical trials justifies some of these concerns, newer vasodilating beta-blockers (e.g., carvedilol) have been shown to have a neutral or positive effect on dyslipidemia and insulin resistance. beta-Blockade in conjunction with ACE inhibition should be standard therapy for all patients with diabetes who have heart failure. Furthermore, early in-hospital initiation of neurohormonal intervention can provide earlier benefit to these patients.

### Contemporary use and implications of Beta-blockers in patients with HFmrEF or HFpEF: the DELIVER trial [^111qtQG1]. JACC: Heart Failure (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Although beta-blockers are not recommended for the treatment of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) according to the latest European Society of Cardiology and American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology/Heart Failure Society of America guidelines, these therapies remain commonly used for comorbidity management. There has been concern that beta-blockers may adversely influence clinical outcomes by limiting chronotropic response in HFpEF.

Objectives

This study sought to examine the contemporary use and implications of beta-blockers in patients with heart failure with mildly reduced ejection fraction (HFmrEF) or HFpEF.

Methods

In the DELIVER (Dapagliflozin Evaluation to Improve the Lives of Patients With Preserved Ejection Fraction Heart Failure) trial, a total of 6,263 patients with symptomatic heart failure (HF) with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) > 40% were randomized to dapagliflozin or placebo across 20 countries. In this prespecified analysis, efficacy and safety outcomes were examined according to beta-blocker use at randomization. The primary outcome was cardiovascular death or worsening HF.

Results

Overall, beta-blockers were used in 5,177 patients (83%), with wide variation by geographic region. Beta-blocker use was associated with a lower risk of the primary outcome in covariate-adjusted models (HR: 0.70; 95% CI: 0.60–0.83). Dapagliflozin consistently reduced the risk of the primary outcome in patients taking beta-blockers (HR: 0.82; 95% CI: 0.72–0.94) and in patients not taking beta-blockers (HR: 0.79; 95% CI: 0.61–1.03; P interaction = 0.85), with similar findings for key secondary endpoints. Adverse events were balanced between patients randomized to dapagliflozin and placebo, regardless of background beta-blocker use.

Conclusions

In patients with HFmrEF or HFpEF who were enrolled in DELIVER, 4 out of 5 participants were treated with a beta-blocker. Beta-blocker use was not associated with a higher risk of worsening HF or cardiovascular death. Dapagliflozin consistently and safely reduced clinical events, irrespective of background beta-blocker use.

Management of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction remains a clinical dilemma

The medical management of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) remains challenging, and no drug has demonstrated a clear benefit on morbidity and mortality in this population (Figure 1).

Figure 1
Kaplan Meier curve for the primary composite endpoint (all cause death, non fatal myocardial infarction, non fatal stroke and hospitalization for worsening heart failure) in the overall SUPPORT population.

The SUPPORT trial examined whether an additive treatment with an angiotensin receptor blocker, olmesartan, reduces the mortality and morbidity in hypertensive patients with chronic heart failure treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, beta blockers, or both. In this prospective randomized open-label study, 1147 patients were enrolled. Mean ejection fraction was 54%. During a median follow-up of 4.4 years, there was no statistical difference in the occurrence of the primary outcome made of all-cause death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, and hospitalization for worsening heart failure between the two groups (HR = 1.18; 95% CI, 0.96–1.46; p = 0.11), whereas a significant increase in worsening renal function was observed. The addition of olmesartan to patients treated by the combination of ACE inhibitors and beta blockers was, however, associated with a significant increase in the occurrence of the primary endpoint (HR = 1.47; 95% CI, 1.11–1.95; p = 0.006) all-cause death and renal dysfunction. These findings lead to the conclusion that combination therapy of ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor antagonists, and beta blockers is not recommended in HFpEF since it is associated with increased cardiovascular risk and increased risk of renal dysfunction.

OVERVIEW OF THE CURRENT DRUG TREATMENT OF HF IN PATIENTS WITH A PRESERVED EJECTION FRACTION

The objectives of HF treatment are to increase survival, reduce hospitalizations for worsening HF, and improve quality of life. To achieve these objectives, current Americanand EuropeanHF guidelines have developed specific treatment recommendations for patients with HFrEF. In contrast, most patients with a mildly reduced and a midrange LVEF, HFmrEF, and HFpEF, respectively, have been left with symptomatic supportive care due to an alleged lack of evidence. Due to data that have emerged from recent RCTs, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved new HF drugs, and American guidelines have been revised accordingly. Also, the European Medical Agency (EMA) and European HF Guidelines may follow, at least partly with the SGLT2Is but not with the traditional drug classes mentioned above.

The treatment recommendations for HFrEF include renin–angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors (ACEI or ARB, alternatively ARNI), selected beta-blockers, MRAs, and SGLT2Is. The results of major outcome trials and the scientific basis for using these drug classes, "cornerstones", in HFpEF, are summarized in Figure 3 and are further discussed based on information included in Tables 2 and 5.

Figure 3.
The cornerstones of drug treatment of heart failure. Abbreviations are defined in the footnotes in Table 1 and Figure 1.

Bisoprolol, carvedilol, metoprolol, and nebivolol are included because these beta-blockers have been proven to reduce mortality in HFrEF. Hypertensive patients with severe HF may have low blood pressure because of very high total peripheral resistance and may need careful in-hospital up-titration of medications from all 4 corners, as indicated in the lower part of Figure 3.

Cardio-oncology — baseline evaluation, monitoring, and prevention during potentially cardiotoxic therapy: In patients with cardiovascular risk factors or known cardiac disease being considered for potentially cardiotoxic anticancer therapies, pretherapy evaluation of cardiac function is reasonable to establish baseline cardiac function and guide the choice of cancer therapy. In patients with cardiovascular risk factors or known cardiac disease receiving potentially cardiotoxic anticancer therapies, monitoring of cardiac function is reasonable for the early identification of drug-induced cardiomyopathy. In patients at risk of cancer therapy–related cardiomyopathy, initiation of beta blockers and ACEI/ARB for the primary prevention of drug-induced cardiomyopathy is of uncertain benefit. In patients being considered for potentially cardiotoxic therapies, serial measurement of cardiac troponin might be reasonable for further risk stratification.

Asymptomatic post-MI or LV remodeling — risk and aldosterone antagonist: Patients without HF symptoms but who have had an MI or who have evidence of LV remodeling are at considerable risk of developing HF, and in such patients the incidence of HF can be decreased by reducing additional injury and by retarding LV remodeling. In this setting, the aldosterone antagonist eplerenone has been shown to reduce morbidity and mortality in patients with low EF and no HF after MI already treated with ACEIs and beta-blockers.

### A trial of the β-blocker bucindolol in patients with advanced chronic heart failure [^112aVLdh]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2001). Excellent credibility.

Background

Although beta-adrenergic-receptor antagonists reduce morbidity and mortality in patients with mild-to-moderate chronic heart failure, their effect on survival in patients with more advanced heart failure is unknown.

Methods

A total of 2708 patients with heart failure designated as New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class III (in 92 percent of the patients) or IV (in 8 percent) and a left ventricular ejection fraction of 35 percent or lower were randomly assigned to double-blind treatment with either bucindolol (1354 patients) or placebo (1354 patients) and followed for the primary end point of death from any cause.

Results

The data and safety monitoring board recommended stopping the trial after the seventh interim analysis. At that time, there was no significant difference in mortality between the two groups (unadjusted P = 0.16). The results presented here are based on complete follow-up at the time of study termination (average, 2.0 years). There were a total of 449 deaths in the placebo group (33 percent) and 411 deaths in the bucindolol group (30 percent; adjusted P = 0.13). The risk of the secondary end point of death from cardiovascular causes was lower in the bucindolol group (hazard ratio, 0.86; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.74 to 0.99), as was the risk of heart transplantation or death (hazard ratio, 0.87; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.77 to 0.99).

Conclusions

In a demographically diverse group of patients with NYHA class III and IV heart failure, bucindolol resulted in no significant overall survival benefit.

### Is bisoprolol underutilized in U.S. Heart Failure patients? [^112c81EF]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Recently, two randomized clinical trials have provided intriguing data regarding the effects of metoprolol and bisoprolol in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who did not have heart failure. BLOCK-COPD (Beta-Blockers for the Prevention of Acute Exacerbations of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease)randomized 532 patients without class I indications for β-blockers to either placebo or metoprolol succinate. BICS (Bisoprolol in COPD Study) randomized 519 patients to placebo or bisoprolol. The two trials share many similarities: they included patients with at least moderate airflow limitation and at least 1 (2 in the case of BICS) COPD exacerbation in the year preceding enrollment. The treatment drugs also were titrated up to equivalent maximal doses. BICS aimed for a maximum of 5 mg bisoprolol (half of the 10 mg maximum dose in the CIBIS-II [Cardiac Insufficiency Bisoprolol Study II] trial that proved a mortality benefit in patients with HFrEF). Similarly, BLOCK-COPD set a goal of 100 mg of metoprolol (again, half the 200 mg used in MERIT-HF [Metoprolol CR/XL Randomised Intervention Trial in Congestive Heart Failure]). Both trials were undertaken with the hope that a β-blocker would decrease the number of COPD exacerbations, based on associations reported in observational studies. Compared with placebo, metoprolol was actually associated with a significantly increased rate of COPD exacerbations that led to hospitalization, or hospitalization plus intubation (rate ratio: 1.6; 95% CI: 1.10–2.42). In BICS, bisoprolol was not associated with any such increase. Both trials reported a significant increase in patient's subjective feelings of dyspnea in the treatment group.

Hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus in heart failure — Approximately two thirds of patients with HF have a past or current history of hypertension, and approximately one third have diabetes mellitus. Little is known about the benefits of treating hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, or diabetes mellitus in patients with established reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and symptoms of HF. Nevertheless, it is prudent to manage hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and diabetes mellitus in patients with HF as if the patients did not have HF. Drugs that can both control blood pressure and treat HF should be preferred in patients with both conditions; this includes the use of diuretics, ACEIs, and beta-blockers, whereas physicians should avoid the use of most calcium channel blockers or potent direct-acting vasodilators such as minoxidil. The drugs routinely used in the management of HF in nondiabetic patients should be administered to those with diabetes mellitus, and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-blockers prevent the progression of HF in diabetic and nondiabetic patients. Physicians should not avoid the use of beta-blockers in diabetic patients despite fears that these drugs may mask symptoms of hypoglycemia or may exacerbate glucose intolerance or insulin resistance. Renal artery stenosis should be considered in patients with hypertension and HF, because renal artery stenting can treat both conditions. Thiazolidinediones have been associated with increased peripheral edema and symptomatic HF, the risk of developing edema with thiazolidinediones is dose related and higher in diabetic patients who are taking concomitant insulin therapy, and the incidence of thiazolidinedione-related fluid retention is low in patients with NYHA functional class I to II symptoms in whom these drugs can be administered safely with careful monitoring for fluid retention. Initiation of these drugs is not recommended in patients with NYHA functional class III to IV symptoms of HF. Clinical experience has shown that one side effect of several oral agents of the thiazolidinedione class is weight gain, which is due in part to fluid retention, and this effect may have the potential to precipitate or exacerbate HF in patients with reduced cardiac reserve; thiazolidinediones probably should be used with caution in such patients.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2016). Medium credibility.

Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) — renin-angiotensin system inhibition is recommended to reduce morbidity and mortality. The clinical strategy of inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), or an angiotensin receptor–neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI) in conjunction with evidence-based beta blockers and aldosterone antagonists in selected patients is recommended for patients with chronic HFrEF to reduce morbidity and mortality. In an RCT comparing valsartan/sacubitril with enalapril, the ARNI reduced the composite endpoint of cardiovascular death or heart failure (HF) hospitalization significantly, by 20%. The use of ARNI is associated with the risk of hypotension and renal insufficiency and may lead to angioedema, as well.

β‑Receptor antagonists (beta‑blockers) — pediatric HFrEF: In children with systemic LV systolic dysfunction, use of β‑blockers is reasonable (Class IIa, Level of Evidence C). Adult data show multiple randomized controlled trials with improved outcomes, whereas a multicenter, prospective pediatric RCT did not demonstrate improved outcomes with carvedilol versus placebo; despite differential receptor remodeling and animal data suggesting potential β1‑selective benefit in younger children, there is inadequate associated clinical evidence to support such specificity, and beta‑blockers are recommended for children with HFrEF with a systemic left ventricle.

### Drug therapy recommendations from the 2005 ACC / AHA guidelines for treatment of chronic heart failure [^117QtS7d]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To review and discuss key aspects of the drug therapy recommendations in the American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) 2005 Guideline Update for the Diagnosis and Management of Chronic Heart Failure (HF) in the Adult.

Data Sources

Data were obtained from the ACC/AHA 2005 Guideline Update for Chronic HF. English-language clinical trials, observational studies, and pertinent review articles evaluating the pharmacotherapy of chronic HF were identified, based on MEDLINE searches through January 2006.

Study Selection

Articles presenting information that impacts the evidence base for recommendations regarding the use of various drug therapies in patients with chronic HF were evaluated.

Data Synthesis

The ACC/AHA 2005 Guideline Update for HF provides revised, evidence-based recommendations for the treatment of chronic HF. The new guidelines are based on a staging system that recognizes both the development and progression of HF. Recommendations are provided for 2 stages of patients (A and B) who do not yet have clinical HF but are clearly at risk and 2 stages (C and D) that include patients with symptomatic HF. The guidelines continue to emphasize the important role of neurohormonal blockade with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor blockers, beta-adrenergic blockers, and aldosterone antagonists. Based on recent trials, updated recommendations address the roles of combination therapy and the selective addition of hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate. Along with specific drug recommendations, information on the practical use of various drugs is provided. Although the guidelines primarily focus on HF due to systolic dysfunction, general recommendations are also provided for patients with preserved systolic function.

Conclusions

The ACC/AHA 2005 Guideline Update provides evidence-based recommendations for healthcare professionals involved in the care of adults with chronic HF. Recent clinical trial findings have further clarified the evolving role of neurohormonal-blocking drugs in the prevention and treatment of HF.

Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) — atrial fibrillation (AF) rate control: Beta blockers and nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers are often considered as first-line agents for heart rate control, yet in RATE-AF comparing bisoprolol with digoxin, the primary quality-of-life endpoint was similar at 6 months; several secondary quality-of-life endpoints, functional capacity, and NT-proBNP reduction favored digoxin at 12 months, with similar heart rate reduction and more dizziness, lethargy, and hypotension with beta blockers.

### Underuse of β-blockers in heart failure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^114VXyAY]. Heart (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is one of the world's leading causes of morbidity and mortality. Cardiovascular comorbidity is common in patients with COPD, at least partly due to the common risk factor of cigarette smoking. The prevalence of COPD in patients with heart failure (HF) ranges from 11%–52% to 9%–41% in North American and European patients, respectively. There is a need to evaluate the drugs used in the treatment of common comorbidities in COPD, in particular the putative effects of β-blockers on the cardiovascular burden and its associated impact on mortalityβ-blockers are established in HF management guidelines, which reinforce their use in patients with concomitant COPD. However, aside from the use of long-term oxygen therapy, there are no respiratory drugs that have been shown to have a significant impact on mortality in COPD.

COPD management guidelines also state that the benefits of selective β-1 antagonists in HF outweigh potential risks, even in patients with severe COPD. Because of concerns regarding potential bronchoconstriction (especially in patients with more severe COPD), primary and secondary care physicians remain somewhat reticent to prescribe β-blockers in COPD. In a retrospective study of 1603 patients with COPD and a history of myocardial infarction (MI), 22% were prescribed a beta -blocker on admission to hospital and 55% of patients were not prescribed one β-blocker.

Initiating treatment with β-blockers in HF and COPD is not simple. It requires careful initial dose titration over a period of weeks, along with monitoring of heart rate, supine and standing blood pressure and spirometry. Moreover, β-blockers tend to be less well tolerated in older patients with comorbidities, such as diabetes, peripheral vascular disease and renal impairment, who are more prone to postural hypotension. This may further compound the reluctance to prescribe β-blockers in HF and COPD, especially in a busy outpatient setting.

### Population-based analysis of class effect of β blockers in heart failure [^1111X1vJ]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2011). Low credibility.

The long-term use of β blockers has been shown to improve the outcomes of patients with heart failure (HF). However, it is still disputed whether this is a class effect, and, specifically, whether carvedilol or bisoprolol are superior to metoprolol. The present study was a comparative effectiveness study of β blockers for patients with HF in a population-based setting. We conducted an observational cohort study using the Quebec administrative databases to identify patients with HF who were prescribed a β blocker after the diagnosis of HF. We used descriptive statistics to characterize the patients by the type of β blocker prescribed at discharge. The unadjusted mortality for users of each β blocker was calculated using Kaplan-Meier curves and compared using the log-rank test. To account for differences in follow-up and to control for differences among patient characteristics, a multivariate Cox proportional hazards model was used to compare the mortality. Of the 26,787 patients with HF, with a median follow-up of 1.8 years per patient, the crude incidence of death was 47% with metoprolol, 40% with atenolol, 41% with carvedilol, 36% with bisoprolol, and 43% with acebutolol. After controlling for several different covariates, we found that carvedilol (hazard ratio [HR] 1.04, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.97 to 1.12, p = 0.22) and bisoprolol (HR 0.96, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.01, p = 0.16) were not superior to metoprolol in improving survival. Atenolol (HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.77 to 0.87, p < 0.0001) and acebutolol (HR 0.86, 95% CI 0.78 to 0.95, p = 0.004) were superior to metoprolol. In conclusion, we did not find evidence of a class effect for β blockers in patients with HF.

### 2022 AHA / ACC / HFSA guideline for the management of heart failure: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^116p4DEi]. Circulation (2022). High credibility.

Heart failure with mildly reduced ejection fraction (HFmrEF) — pharmacologic recommendations: In patients with HFmrEF, sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) can be beneficial in decreasing heart failure (HF) hospitalizations and cardiovascular mortality. Among patients with current or previous symptomatic HFmrEF (left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF], 41%–49%), use of evidence-based beta blockers for HFrEF, angiotensin receptor–neprilysin inhibitor (ARNi), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi), or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) may be considered to reduce the risk of HF hospitalization and cardiovascular mortality, particularly among patients with LVEF on the lower end of this spectrum.

### Impact of digoxin versus β-blocker in patients with coexistent atrial fibrillation and heart failure: a target trial emulation [^115AizU6]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Beta-blockers are a cornerstone of HF therapy, with their benefits in patients with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) strongly supported by large RCTs. As a result, they are given a Class IA recommendation in both European and American guidelines. Beta-blockers are also recommended (Class IB) for AF management due to their ability to slow conduction through the atrioventricular node. However, this recommendation is not based on large, randomized outcome trials. In a patient-level meta-analysis of landmark RCTs including individuals with HFrEF, beta-blockers significantly reduced all-cause mortality in patients with sinus rhythm but not in those with AF at baseline. This discrepancy may stem from the lack of benefit associated with slower heart rates in AF compared to sinus rhythm, and a low heart rate in patients with AF may be an expression of an underlying conduction disorder, which may be associated with impaired outcome itself. Although additional prospective studies are required to elucidate this relationship further, beta-blockers are generally considered safe for patients with AF and HF and are supported by a Class IIa recommendation.

The mechanism of action of digoxin includes neurohormonal (antiadrenergic or vagal) effects, electrophysiological effects (prolongation of the atrioventricular node refractory period), cellular effects (inhibition of the sodium–potassium ATPase pump), and resultant hemodynamic changes. Digoxin is recommended as a Class IIb therapy for symptomatic HFrEF in sinus rhythm, based on evidence from the Digitalis Investigation Group (DIG) study, which showed that digoxin reduces hospitalization rates and symptom burden but has a neutral effect on mortality. For AF patients, digoxin is recommended as a Class IB therapy for heart rate control, similar to beta-blockers, though previous studies have reported conflicting results regarding its impact on mortality. A 2015 systematic review and meta-analysis suggested a neutral effect of digoxin on mortality, whereas a 2023 umbrella review indicated that digoxin use is associated with a moderately increased risk of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, making a declined trend in digoxin prescription.

### Association between beta-blockers and mortality and readmission in older patients with heart failure: an instrumental variable analysis [^113o9RoQ]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The demographics of heart failure are changing. The rate of growth of the "older" heart failure population, specifically those ≥ 75, has outpaced that of any other age group. These older patients were underrepresented in the early beta-blocker trials. There are several reasons, including a decreased potential for mortality benefit and increased risk of side effects, why the risk/benefit tradeoff may be different in this population.

Objective

We aimed to determine the association between receipt of a beta-blocker after heart failure discharge and early mortality and readmission rates among patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), specifically patients aged 75+.

Design and Participants

We used 100% Medicare Parts A and B and a random 40% sample of Part D to create a cohort of beneficiaries with ≥ 1 hospitalization for HFrEF between 2008 and 2016 to run an instrumental variable analysis.

Main Measure

The primary measure was 90-day, all-cause mortality; the secondary measure was 90-day, all-cause readmission.

Key Results

Using the two-stage least squared methodology, among all HFrEF patients, receipt of a beta-blocker within 30-day of discharge was associated with a - 4.35% (95% CI - 6.27 to - 2.42%, p < 0.001) decrease in 90-day mortality and a - 4.66% (95% CI - 7.40 to - 1.91%, p = 0.001) decrease in 90-day readmission rates. Even among patients ≥ 75 years old, receipt of a beta-blocker at discharge was also associated with a significant decrease in 90-day mortality, - 4.78% (95% CI - 7.19 to - 2.40%, p < 0.001) and 90-day readmissions, - 4.67% (95% CI - 7.89 to - 1.45%, p < 0.001).

Conclusion

Patients aged ≥ 75 years who receive a beta-blocker after HFrEF hospitalization have significantly lower 90-day mortality and readmission rates. The magnitude of benefit does not appear to wane with age. Absent a strong contraindication, all patients with HFrEF should attempt beta-blocker therapy at/after hospital discharge, regardless of age.

### 2009 ACCF / AHA focused update on perioperative beta blockade [^115hsB3b]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2009). Medium credibility.

Perioperative beta-blocker therapy — recommendations and risk factors: Preoperative beta-blocker therapy should be considered in the context of a full evaluation of each patient's clinical and surgical risk, including identification of active cardiac conditions that require intensive management and may result in delay or cancellation of surgery unless the surgery is emergent. Clinical risk factors used in current recommendations are unchanged from the prior document and include history of ischemic heart disease, history of compensated or prior heart failure, history of cerebrovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, and renal insufficiency defined as a preoperative serum creatinine of more than 2 mg/dL. The surgery-specific cardiac risk of noncardiac surgery remains relevant, but limited data are available to guide beta-blocker use with newer techniques (e.g., percutaneous or endovascular vascular procedures) that may be associated with lower short-term risk. The prior document outlined conflicting evidence regarding the efficacy of beta blockers in reducing perioperative cardiac events, and the best approach to medically reduce cardiovascular complications during noncardiac surgery was still unknown. The authors advocated for randomized controlled trials because there may be some harm associated with beta-blocker therapy in low-risk patients, and they noted key literature gaps: most trials were inadequately powered; few randomized trials of medical therapy to prevent perioperative major adverse cardiac events had been performed; few trials examined perioperative beta-blocker therapy, particularly in high-risk patients; studies to determine the role of beta blockers in intermediate- and low-risk populations and the optimal type, dose, timing, duration, and titration were lacking; and no studies addressed care-delivery mechanisms for how, when, and by whom therapy should be prescribed and monitored.

Hospitalized HFrEF — low blood pressure and renal function considerations with GDMT: In CHAMP-HF, few patients with SBP < 110 mm Hg achieved target doses of therapies, specifically beta blockers (17.5%), ACEi-ARB (6.2%), or ARNi (1.8%); in PARADIGM-HF, patients with lower SBP on sacubitril-valsartan had the same tolerance and relative benefit over enalapril as those with higher SBP; SENIORS reported nebivolol had equivalent tolerance and benefits irrespective of SBP; in Val-HeFT, decreases in SBP did not offset the beneficial effects of valsartan on HF morbidity; small to moderate renal function worsening defined as ≥ 20% decrease in eGFR was not associated with AKI, and spironolactone and beta blockers might be protective; in OPTIMIZE-HF, discharge use of carvedilol was associated with a reduction in 60- to 90-day mortality and composite risk of mortality.

Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Hydralazine plus isosorbide dinitrate — combination vasodilator therapy in HF — reduced mortality but not hospitalizations versus placebo in patients treated with digoxin and diuretics but not an ACEI or beta-blocker; compared with an ACEI, the ACEI produced more favorable effects on survival, a benefit not evident in the subgroup of patients with class III to IV HF. The combination produced frequent adverse reactions (primarily headache and gastrointestinal complaints), and many patients could not continue treatment at target doses. A post hoc analysis showed particular efficacy in the black cohort, and in a confirmatory trial limited to the black population with HF, adding hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate to standard therapy with an ACEI and/or a beta-blocker was shown to be of significant benefit. The combination of hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate should not be used for the treatment of HF in patients who have no prior use of an ACEI and should not be substituted for ACEIs in patients who are tolerating ACEIs without difficulty; despite limited data in ACEI-intolerant patients, the combined use may be considered as a therapeutic option, though compliance has been generally poor because of the large number of tablets and the high incidence of adverse reactions. For patients with more severe symptoms and ACEI intolerance, the combination of hydralazine and nitrates is used frequently, but there are no trials specifically in patients with persistent symptoms and intolerance to inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system.

### 2020 ACC / AHA clinical performance and quality measures for adults with heart failure: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on performance measures [^116LtvZ9]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2020). High credibility.

PM-4: Beta-blocker therapy for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) — The performance measure defines the percentage of patients age ≥ 18 with a diagnosis of heart failure with a current or prior left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤ 40% who were prescribed beta-blocker therapy either within a 12-mo period when seen in the outpatient setting or at hospital discharge. The numerator is patients who were prescribed beta-blocker therapy either within a 12-mo period when seen in the outpatient setting or at hospital discharge, where outpatient includes a prescription at ≥ 1 visits in the 12-mo measurement period or documentation that the patient is already taking a beta blocker, and inpatient includes a prescription at discharge or documentation to continue therapy after discharge; beta-blocker therapy should include bisoprolol, carvedilol, or sustained-release metoprolol succinate. The denominator is all patients age ≥ 18 with a diagnosis of heart failure with a current or prior LVEF ≤ 40%, with denominator exclusions of heart transplant and LVAD and denominator exceptions for documentation of medical reason(s) (e.g., intolerance) or patient reason(s) (e.g., patient refusal) for not prescribing beta-blocker therapy. Rationale states that beta blockers improve survival and reduce hospitalization for patients with stable heart failure and reduced LVEF, and treatment should be initiated as soon as a patient is diagnosed with reduced LVEF and does not have prohibitively low systemic blood pressure, fluid overload, or recent treatment with an intravenous positive inotropic agent. Clinical recommendations cited are that use of 1 of the 3 beta blockers proven to reduce mortality (bisoprolol, carvedilol, sustained-release metoprolol succinate) is recommended for all patients with current or prior symptoms of HFrEF, unless contraindicated, to reduce morbidity and mortality (Class I, Level of Evidence: A), and that initiation of beta-blocker therapy is recommended after optimization of volume status and successful discontinuation of intravenous diuretics, vasodilators, and inotropic agents; therapy should be initiated at a low dose and only in stable patients, with caution when patients have required inotropes during their hospital course (Class I, Level of Evidence: B).

### A randomized trial of β-blockade in heart failure. the cardiac insufficiency bisoprolol study (CIBIS). CIBIS investigators and committees [^114mTDy6]. Circulation (1994). Low credibility.

The study CIBIS was published by CIBIS Investigators. and colleagues in 1994 in the journal Circulation. This study is related to the following diseases: Heart failure. In the CIBIS study, the trial question was: what is the role of β-blockade therapy with bisoprolol in patients with chronic HF of various etiologies and a LVEF of < 40% on diuretic and vasodilator therapy? In the CIBIS study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the CIBIS study, the population was: 641 patients (112 female, 529 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with chronic HF of various etiologies and an LVEF < 40% on diuretic and vasodilator therapy. The key exclusion criteria were LV diastolic dysfunction, coronary artery disease awaiting bypass surgery or a recent history of myocardial infarction < 3 months, insulin-dependent diabetes, asthma, renal insufficiency hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism, or malignant disease. In the CIBIS study, the interventions were: n = 320 β-blockade therapy with bisoprolol (recommended dose increment or at one of the dose levels of 1.25, 2.5, 3.75, or 5 mg/d) n = 321 placebo (matching placebo). In the CIBIS study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in death (16.6% vs. 20.9%; RR 0.8, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.15). In the CIBIS study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in hospitalization for cardiac decompensation (19.1% vs. 28%; RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.16 to 1.2) Significant increase in reduction by at least one NYHA functional class (21.3% vs. 15%; RR 1.42, 95% CI 0.06 to 2.78). In the CIBIS study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in premature treatment withdrawals. In the CIBIS study, the conclusion was: in patients with chronic HF of various etiologies and an LVEF < 40% on diuretic and vasodilator therapy, β-blockade therapy with bisoprolol was not superior to placebo with respect to death.

### A comparative analysis of the results from 4 trials of β-blocker therapy for heart failure: BEST, CIBIS-II, MERIT-HF, and COPERNICUS [^111coyGC]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Recent large randomized, controlled trials (BEST [Beta-blocker Evaluation of Survival Trial], CIBIS-II [Cardiac Insufficiency Bisoprolol Trial II], COPERNICUS [Carvedilol Prospective Randomized Cumulative Survival Study], and MERIT-HF [Metoprolol Randomized Intervention Trial in Congestive Heart Failure]) have addressed the usefulness of beta-blockade in the treatment of advanced heart failure. CIBIS-II, COPERNICUS, and MERIT-HF have shown that beta-blocker treatment with bisoprolol, carvedilol, and metoprolol XL, respectively, reduce mortality in advanced heart failure patients, whereas BEST found a statistically nonsignificant trend toward reduced mortality with bucindolol. We conducted a post hoc analysis to determine whether the response to beta-blockade in BEST could be related to differences in the clinical and demographic characteristics of the study populations. We generated a sample from BEST to resemble the patient cohorts studied in CIBIS-II and MERIT-HF to find out whether the response to beta-blocker therapy was similar to that reported in the other trials. These findings are further compared with COPERNICUS, which entered patients with more severe heart failure.

Methods

To achieve conformity with the entry criteria for CIBIS-II and MERIT-HF, the BEST study population was adjusted to exclude patients with systolic blood pressure < 100 mm Hg, heart rate < 60 bpm, and age > 80 years (exclusion criteria employed in those trials). The BEST comparison subgroup (BCG) was further modified to more closely reflect the racial demographics reported for patients enrolled in CIBIS-II and MERIT-HF. The association of beta-blocker therapy with overall survival and survival free of cardiac death, sudden cardiac death, and progressive pump failure in the BCG was assessed.

Results

In the BCG subgroup, bucindolol treatment was associated with significantly lower risk of death from all causes (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.77 [95% CI = 0.65, 0.92]), cardiovascular death (HR = 0.71 [0.58, 0.86]), sudden death (HR = 0.77 [0.59, 0.999]), and pump failure death (HR = 0.64 [0.45, 0.91]).

Conclusions

Although not excluding the possibility of differences resulting from chance alone or to different properties among beta-blockers, this study suggests the possibility that different heart failure population subgroups may have different responses to beta-blocker therapy.

### Pharmacologic therapy for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction: closing the gap between clinical guidelines and practice [^112ZDTrA]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Despite the great progress made in the management of heart failure (HF) with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), its prevalence continues to rise owing to an aging population and an epidemic of hypertension, obesity and coronary artery disease. For decades, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and beta blockers have been the mainstay of HFrEF therapy. The recent addition of sacubitril/valsartan and ivabradine to the HF armamentarium has the potential to transform our therapeutic approach to HFrEF, while simultaneously raising some questions and uncertainties on their applicability. In this paper, we review the pathophysiology of HFrEF, discuss already established and novel evidenced-based pharmacologic therapies available for these patients. We also share some therapeutic strategies aimed to optimize HF therapy in specific undertreated patient populations including the elderly and patients with chronic kidney disease, while offering insight on how to tailor therapy in the "real-world".

### Dosing of β-blocker therapy before, during, and after hospitalization for heart failure (from organized program to initiate lifesaving treatment in hospitalized patients with heart failure) [^1119ia2u]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

Heart failure (HF) guidelines recommend that beta blockers be titrated to achieve the target doses shown to be effective in major clinical trials, if tolerated. Little is known, however, regarding the doses of beta blockers used in patients with HF in routine clinical practice before, during, and after hospitalization for HF. The Organized Program to Initiate Lifesaving Treatment in Hospitalized Patients With Heart Failure (OPTIMIZE-HF) enrolled 5,791 patients admitted with HF in a registry with prespecified 60- to 90-day follow-up at 91 academic and community hospitals throughout the United States. Among 2,373 patients with systolic HF eligible for beta blockers at discharge, 1,350 (56.9%) were receiving beta-blocker therapy before admission and continued on therapy, and 632 (26.6%) were newly started. The mean total daily dose for beta blockers before hospital admission was < 1/2 the recommended target dose (carvedilol 21.5 ± 17.8 mg and metoprolol succinate 69.2 ± 51.9 mg), with infrequent up- or down-titration during the HF hospitalization. More than 2/3 of patients had no change in their beta-blocker doses in the first 60 to 90 days after hospital discharge. At 60- to 90-day postdischarge follow-up, only 17.5% and 7.9% of patients were being treated with recommended target doses of carvedilol and metoprolol succinate, respectively. In conclusion, these data reveal that the doses of beta blockers applied in clinical practice are substantially less that the doses achieved in randomized clinical trials in HF and recommended in national guidelines. In the first 60 to 90 days after hospital discharge, little up-titration in beta-blocker dosing occurs. Further efforts are needed to help understand and overcome this beta-blocker titration gap.

### Association of β-blocker use with heart failure hospitalizations and cardiovascular disease mortality among patients with heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction: a secondary analysis of the TOPCAT trial [^114q1j4h]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Importance

β-Blockers are prescribed to most patients with heart failure (HF) with a preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), but their effect on HFpEF remains unclear.

Objective

To determine the association of β-blocker use with HF hospitalizations and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality, overall and in strata of patients with an ejection fraction (EF) of 50% or greater or less than 50%.

Design, Setting, and Participants

For 1761 participants from North and South America enrolled in the multicenter, double-blinded Treatment of Preserved Cardiac Function Heart Failure with an Aldosterone Antagonist randomized clinical trial of spironolactone for patients with HFpEF between August 10, 2006, and January 31, 2012, the association of baseline β-blocker use with HF hospitalization and CVD mortality was analyzed using unadjusted and adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression models, overall and in strata of patients with an EF of 50% or greater or less than 50%. Participants had symptomatic HF with a left ventricular EF of 45% or greater, with enrollment based on either hospitalization attributed to decompensated HF in the prior year or elevated natriuretic peptide levels. Statistical analysis was performed from January 31 to May 2, 2019.

Exposure

Use of β-blockers.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Incident HF hospitalization and CVD mortality.

Among 1761 participants included in the analysis (879 women and 882 men; mean [SD] age, 71.5 [9.6] years), 1394 (79.2%) reported β-blocker use and 1567 (89.0%) had an EF of 50% or greater. Hospitalizations for HF occurred for 399 participants (22.7%), and CVD mortality occurred for 229 participants (13.0%). Use of β-blockers was associated with a higher risk of HF hospitalization among patients with HFpEF with an EF of 50% or greater (hazard ratio, 1.74 [95% CI, 1.28–2.37]; P < .001) but not among patients with an EF between 45% and 49% (hazard ratio, 0.68 [95% CI, 0.28–1.63]; p = 0.39). There was a significant interaction between β-blocker use and EF threshold for incident HF hospitalizations (P = .03). Use of β-blockers was not associated with a change in CVD mortality.

Conclusions and Relevance

For patients with an EF of 50% or greater, β-blocker use was associated with an increased risk of HF hospitalizations but not CVD mortality. For patients with an EF between 45% and 49%, there was no such association.

### Are β-blockers as efficacious in patients with diabetes mellitus as in patients without diabetes mellitus who have chronic heart failure? A meta-analysis of large-scale clinical trials [^113kUy51]. American Heart Journal (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Diabetes mellitus is a frequent comorbid condition in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) and confers a worse prognosis. Furthermore, although patients with CHF derive considerable benefit from beta-blockers, these agents are thought by many physicians to be contraindicated in patients with diabetes mellitus. Most published studies on beta-blockers in CHF have been unable to reach definitive conclusions about the mortality benefits of these agents in patients with diabetes mellitus. We therefore performed a meta-analysis of beta-blocker trials that reported mortality outcomes in patients with diabetes mellitus who had CHF to pool all available trial evidence on the benefits (or otherwise) of these agents in this setting.

Methods

All-cause mortality data on patients with diabetes mellitus were obtained from all completed beta-blocker CHF randomized placebo-controlled trials involving > 100 patients exposed to beta-blockers, in which outcomes in patients with diabetes mellitus were described. When events were not directly reported, risk ratios (RRs) were derived from analysis of figures and other manuscript data. Results were pooled with the Mantel-Haenszel method.

Results

A total of 24.6% of patients were reported to have diabetes mellitus in the 6 studies analyzed (Australia and New Zealand [ANZ]-Carvedilol, Beta-blocker Evaluation of Survival Trial [BEST], Carvedilol US Trials, Cardiac Insufficiency Bisoprolol Study [CIBIS-II], Carvedilol Prospective Randomized Cumulative Survival Trial [COPERNICUS], and Metoprolol Controlled-release Randomized Intervention Trial in Heart Failure [MERIT-HF]). Patients with diabetes mellitus had increased mortality rates overall compared with subjects without diabetes mellitus (RR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.15–1.36; P < .001). Compared with placebo, beta-blocker therapy for CHF was beneficial in patients with diabetes mellitus (RR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.73–0.96; p = 0.011) and in subjects without diabetes mellitus (RR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.65–0.79; P < .001). The absolute risk reduction in mortality with beta-blocker therapy was greater in patients with heart failure but without diabetes mellitus than in patients with diabetes mellitus (P = .023).

Conclusions

Patients with diabetes mellitus and CHF appear to derive prognostic benefit from beta-blocker therapy, although the magnitude of that benefit is somewhat less than that observed in subjects without diabetes mellitus.

### Under-utilization of evidence-based drug treatment in patients with heart failure is only partially explained by dissimilarity to patients enrolled in landmark trials: a report from the euro heart survey on heart failure [^116gHj8i]. European Heart Journal (2005). Low credibility.

Aims

Surveys on heart failure management suggest under-utilization of life-saving evidence-based treatment. Evidence-based medicine and clinical guidelines are based on the results of randomized controlled trials. Therefore, we investigated how patients who fulfilled the enrolment criteria of randomized trials were treated in real life.

Methods and Results

We selected three large placebo-controlled trials of patients with chronic heart failure, in which ACE-inhibitors (ACE-Is), beta-blockers, and spironolactone proved to be safe and effective. The major enrolment criteria of trials were identified and applied to patients enrolled in the Euro Heart Survey on Heart Failure to identify the proportion of patients eligible for treatment and also treated appropriately. Of the 10 701 patients who were enrolled in the Euro Heart Survey on Heart Failure, only a small percentage (13%) would have qualified for participation in at least one of the selected trials. Patients who fulfilled enrolment criteria of the identified trials were more likely to be treated with ACE-Is (83% of SOLVD-eligible patients), beta-blockers (54% of MERIT-HF-eligible patients), and aldosterone antagonists (43% of RALES-eligible patients) than trial-ineligible patients. Almost half of SOLVD-eligible patients who were treated with ACE-Is received the target dose as recommended in the guidelines, but only < 10% of MERIT-HF eligible patients who were treated with beta-blockers received the target dose.

Conclusion

ACE-Is are widely utilized but given in lower doses than proven effective in clinical trials. beta-Blockers are underused and given in lower doses to patients who fulfil the enrolment criteria of relevant landmark trials.

### Β-blocker therapy in heart failure… [^1161D2Bs]. JAMA Network (2002). Excellent credibility.

with class II and III heart failure. Conclusions Tested in more than 10 000 patients, β-blockers reduce morbidity and mortality in class II through IV heart failure. Along with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, digoxin, and diuretics, β-blockers have strengthened the armamentarium to improve clinical outcomes of heart failure patients. have arrived at the same conclusions: the use of β-blockers was associated with a consistent 30% reduction in mortality and a 40% reduction in hospitalizations in patients with heart failure. In the most recent of these meta-analyses, 92 it was estimated that 26 patients would need to be. treated to avoid 1 death; 25, to avoid 1 hospitalization. Despite differences in patient selection, target doses, methodology, and clinical end points, results were remarkably consistent across these trials. The evidence suggests that virtually all patients with heart failure caused by LV systolic dysfunction benefit from β-blockers.

death, a 49% decrease in death caused by progressive heart failure, and a 35% reduction in hospitalizations caused by heart failure. Treatment of 27 patients with metoprolol for 1 year could prevent 1 death. At approximately the same time, the CIBIS-I4 sought to determine whether bisoprolol therapy was associated with an improvement. In practical terms, however, the observed 23% reduction in mortality represents a clinically important outcome. With the emergence of strong new evidence demonstrating that β-blockers decrease morbidity and mortality in a broad range of patients with heart failure, guidelines from the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association, 12 the European Society of Cardiology, 11 and the Heart Failure Society of America10 all strongly support the use of β-blockers in. trials support the value of β-blockers for patients with heart failure caused by systolic dysfunction.

Tested in more than 10 000 patients, they reduce morbidity and mortality in class II through IV heart failure. Along with ACE inhibitors, digoxin, and diuretics, β-blockers have strengthened the armamentarium to improve clinical outcomes of heart failure patients. The science supporting β-blockers must be translated into practice safely and rationally if the agents are to achieve their full potential.

### Evidence… [^1119FcqR]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

Recent large clinical trials have shown that long-term beta blocker therapy reduces morbidity and mortality in patients with chronic heart failure. 1–8 The unequivocal evidence creates a mandate for the extension of beta blocker therapy to the large and growing population of patients with chronic heart failure, a population managed mostly by primary care physicians. There is persistent concern, however, among medical practitioners regarding this seemingly counterintuitive therapy. This concern might lead to underutilization and deprive patients and the health care system of a tremendous benefit. Evidence The first compelling survival evidence supporting the use of beta blockers in patients with chronic heart failure came from the carvedilol research program, which was conducted in patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction and predominantly mild to moderate impairment of exercise tolerance.

1–5 In these studies, carvedilol, which is a nonselective beta blocker with alpha 1-blocker vasodilating properties, reduced mortality by 65 percent and hospitalizations by 29 percent. Carvedilol therapy also resulted in significant improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction and sense of well-being. In the Cardiac Insufficiency Bisoprolol Study II, 6 treatment with bisoprolol, a beta 1-selective blocker, resulted in a 34 percent reduction of mortality in patients with mild or moderate chronic heart failure and systolic dysfunction. The reduction in all-cause hospitalizations was approximately 20 percent. Most recently, the Metoprolol CR/XL Randomised Intervention Trial in Heart Failure 7 demonstrated that treatment with sustained-release metoprolol, also a beta 1-selective blocker, reduced mortality by 34 percent in patients with predominantly mild or moderate chronic heart failure.

These three trials, 1, 6, 7 along with a series of smaller controlled studies, enrolled more than 10, 000 patients and conclusively demonstrated a remarkable reduction in the risk of death and the combined risk of death or hospitalization in patients with chronic heart failure who were treated with one of several beta-adrenergic blockers. Discontinuation of Beta Blockers Stable patients with chronic heart failure who are taken off beta blockers are at risk for circulatory deterioration and electrophysiologic instability. 16 Unless necessary, beta blockers should not be discontinued. If discontinuation is necessary, the dose should be decreased slowly whenever possible.

### Β-blockers in heart failure… [^113AvaYc]. JAMA Network (2002). Excellent credibility.

β-Blockers reduce morbidity and mortality in heart failure patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction and stable fluid status. The successful adoption of β-blocker guidelines for these patients requires an understanding of the value of this therapy and effective systems to maintain safety and ensure high quality of care. This article distills scientific evidence and. consensus guidelines into a series of cases and practical answers about patient selection, discussions with patients, management and monitoring, and systems improvements to optimize quality of care, safety, and benefit for all patients with heart failure. Once thought harmful for patients with heart failure, 1, 2 β-blockers have been shown to reduce morbidity and mortality in heart failure patients. Guidelines also recommend β-blockers for certain patients at risk for developing heart failure caused by hypertension or coronary artery disease.

Patients with severe symptoms and recurrent hospitalizations should be evaluated by a physician experienced in treating heart failure. and recent guidelines11, 13 suggest that β-blockers should be initiated because they reduce progression to heart failure, as in trials of coronary artery disease or hypertension. 17, 19 The 2 previous patients are prototypical "ideal" examples of heart failure patients for whom β-blockers are recommended. Clinicians, however, must. but patients with nonreversible chronic obstructive pulmonary disease have been included in several studies4, 7 and can be expected to do well if observed for worsening respiratory status. Additionally, heart failure patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease20, 23 and diabetes21, 22 may have a greater absolute benefit from β-blockers than those without. excluded from many trials and may be considered to have a higher risk from the medication.

Nevertheless, β-blockers have been found to be safe and effective in smaller studies24, 25 and in a large retrospective study of patients after AMI that included more than 10 000 patients older than 75 years and receiving a β-blocker. 26 Thus, the potential benefits from β-blockers. high doses of an ACE inhibitor. In addition, there is some evidence for benefit with low doses of ACE inhibitors either by themselves or in combination with β-blockers43 as well as for very low doses of β-blockers. 13, 44 Finally, an early benefit for both agents together is plausible based on their separate mechanisms of action.

### Effect of beta blockers in chronic heart failure… [^112wwr6C]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

It has been shown that the use of beta-adrenergic blockers prevents the adverse effects of sympathetic stimulation on the failing heart. Beta blockade has produced favorable results in a large number of randomized, controlled trials. Although two meta-analyses of the effect of beta blockers in heart failure have been published, the emphasis was on rates of mortality, and data from some nonrandomized or uncontrolled trials were included. Lechat and associates combined the results of 18 published double-blind, placebo-controlled and parallel-group trials to include measures not reported in the original publications. The 18 trials enrolled a total of 3, 023 patients with heart failure that was caused by idiopathic dilated cardiopathy and ischemic heart disease. For all end points, there was a significant effect in favor of treatment with beta blockers.

Patients taking beta blockers experienced a 32 percent reduction in the risk of death and a 41 percent reduction in hospitalizations compared with the placebo-treated patients. Patients receiving beta blockers also showed a 32 percent improvement in NYHA classification and were 30 percent less likely to have worsening symptoms. The ejection fraction increased by 29 percent in patients treated with beta blockers compared with placebo-treated patients. Assuming a treatment period identical to the mean duration of follow-up, the authors determined that physicians would need to treat 38 patients to avoid one death, 24 patients to avoid one hospitalization and 15 patients to avoid one combined end point. The meta-analysis indicates that the use of beta blockers is associated with a reduction in mortality of about 30 percent in patients with heart failure.

Any uncertainty about the effect of beta blockers on rates of survival is heightened by the finding that the magnitude of the mortality reduction depends on the pharmacologic properties of the drug used. While selective and nonselective beta blockers increased ejection fractions and decreased hospitalizations in a similar way, nonselective beta blockers were associated with a larger survival benefit than beta. The authors conclude that unlike other meta-analyses, this analysis did not confine itself to mortality but rather analyzed nonfatal measures of outcome such as hospitalizations. For these variables, the number of events was large and the treatment effects were robust. This meta-analysis demonstrates that the addition of a beta blocker to conventional therapy is associated with hemodynamic and symptomatic improvement as well as favorable effects on morbidity and mortality. Physicians have sufficient evidence to support the use of beta blockers in heart failure.
