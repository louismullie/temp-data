## Question

sciatica treatment

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for guidance on sciatica treatment. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining sciatica and establishing the natural history to anchor prognosis. Then, I should verify first-line conservative strategies and their evidence base. Next, I will examine pharmacologic options and their limitations. After that, I need to review interventional therapies like epidural injections and their timing. Then, I will assess surgical indications, timing, and comparative effectiveness. I should also consider special populations and emerging or adjunctive therapies. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stepwise algorithm and highlight evidence gaps and shared decision-making considerations, ensuring I continuously check assumptions against the cited literature as I go.

> Let me first confirm the clinical construct and prognosis so I don't jump to conclusions: sciatica is best understood as a symptom complex of radicular leg pain, typically from nerve root compression or inflammation, most often due to lumbar disc herniation, with a generally favorable natural history in which many patients improve within 2–4 weeks and a substantial proportion recover by 12 months, though 20–30% may have persistent symptoms beyond a year, which frames expectations and the rationale for initial conservative care [^113KCa4R] [^111F2Kgh].

> Hold on, I should verify first-line conservative management principles before recommending anything specific: guidelines consistently endorse staying active and avoiding bed rest, with structured exercise and education as core elements; however, the evidence base for physiotherapy as a single modality is heterogeneous and largely inconclusive, so I need to be cautious about overstating its effect size and emphasize activity and education while individualizing exercise choices and expectations [^117WRM8d] [^111neChg] [^111G3YM5].

> Wait, let me double-check the nuance on exercise versus advice alone: a systematic review suggests exercise may confer a small short-term advantage over advice to stay active for leg pain, but long-term outcomes are similar, reinforcing that the key message is to avoid inactivity and tailor exercise to symptom provocation and patient preference rather than prescribing a specific branded program as superior [^116mLF2P].

> I need to check pharmacologic options next and be explicit about their limitations: NSAIDs show at best very small, often non-clinically meaningful benefits for pain and disability in sciatica, with increased adverse event risk, so they can be used cautiously for short-term symptom relief but should not be expected to change the disease trajectory; pregabalin failed to improve leg pain or disability versus placebo in a high-quality RCT; systemic corticosteroids may offer small short-term improvements but at the cost of a higher adverse event rate, so they should be reserved for carefully selected cases after discussing trade-offs [^112sWKPY] [^112HUDiu] [^113vfXFD] [^117MptgD].

> Let me consider interventional options and their timing, and I should confirm the magnitude and durability of benefit: epidural corticosteroid injections provide a modest, short-term reduction in leg pain and disability, typically lasting weeks to a few months, and are reasonable for patients with severe radicular pain after a trial of conservative care or as a bridge while awaiting natural recovery or surgical planning; importantly, benefits are small and not sustained, so expectations must be calibrated [^1128dqir] [^111AUGZQ] [^1178Ri8V].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost implied epidurals are uniformly effective — let me reconsider and emphasize heterogeneity: while some meta-analyses report short-term superiority over placebo, others highlight low to moderate certainty and failure to meet minimal clinically important differences, so shared decision-making about the limited and transient benefit is essential before proceeding [^1128dqir] [^111AUGZQ].

> Next, I should review surgical indications and comparative effectiveness, and I need to ensure I separate short-term from long-term outcomes: discectomy achieves faster relief of leg pain and perceived recovery in the immediate to short term compared with non-surgical care, but long-term pain and disability outcomes converge by 6–12 months, with no sustained advantage in most trials; therefore, surgery is appropriate for patients with persistent, disabling radicular pain despite comprehensive conservative therapy, or for those who prioritize rapid relief and accept operative risks [^1121zk4g] [^111F2Kgh] [^114fxZpX].

> Hold on, I should verify timing considerations because patients often ask about "early" surgery: in severe sciatica of 6–12 weeks' duration, early surgery accelerates recovery without changing 1–2 year outcomes compared with prolonged conservative care with delayed surgery if needed; in more chronic sciatica (4–12 months), microdiscectomy remains superior to continued nonoperative care at 6 months, supporting a role for surgery when pain persists beyond the typical window of natural recovery [^114fxZpX] [^111CPR4z].

> I should confirm red flags and absolute indications so I don't miss urgent pathology: cauda equina syndrome, progressive motor deficit, or intractable pain with imaging-confirmed compressive pathology warrant urgent surgical consultation, whereas isolated sensory changes or mild weakness without progression can proceed within a stepped-care framework with close monitoring [^notfound].

> Let me think about special populations and emerging therapies, and I need to be careful not to overstate preliminary signals: for patients with a confirmed neuropathic pain phenotype, combining non-pharmacological interventions may modestly improve back pain and short-term disability, though evidence is limited and leg pain benefits are uncertain; anti-TNF agents have not shown consistent benefit and carry safety concerns; acupuncture shows promise in some trials and consensus statements but remains controversial in Western guidelines due to heterogeneity and quality limitations, so it may be considered selectively where accessible and acceptable; traction lacks supportive evidence and should not be routinely recommended [^113bsyoP] [^116TvjZC] [^113rnpc9] [^112aAyAt].

> I should double-check that my practical algorithm aligns with the evidence: start with education on the favorable natural history, activity encouragement, and a simple, symptom-guided exercise plan; use NSAIDs or acetaminophen short term for analgesia with caution about risks; consider a single epidural steroid injection if severe radicular pain persists beyond 6–8 weeks and the patient understands the modest, transient benefit; reassess at 6–12 weeks and refer for surgical evaluation if pain remains disabling, with earlier referral for red flags or patient preference for faster relief; throughout, incorporate shared decision-making about goals, risks, costs, and timing, noting that patient and surgeon preferences often diverge and should be explicitly reconciled [^111F2Kgh] [^117YC1dX] [^112m65sS].

> But wait, what if the patient prioritizes minimizing time off work and is willing to accept surgical risks — does that change the calculus? Yes, in patients with severe leg pain and disability, early discectomy can shorten the time to meaningful recovery without compromising long-term outcomes, so a more proactive surgical timeline can be justified after informed consent and confirmation of concordant imaging, while acknowledging that most patients still improve with continued conservative care albeit more slowly [^114fxZpX] [^111F2Kgh].

> I need to ensure I highlight evidence gaps and uncertainties so expectations remain realistic: many physiotherapy and combined intervention trials suffer from heterogeneity and risk of bias, pharmacologic options have limited or negative high-quality evidence in sciatica specifically, and surgical evidence, though consistent in direction, is largely non-blinded with crossover, underscoring the need for larger, methodologically rigorous trials and better patient stratification to personalize care pathways [^117WRM8d] [^111jfPh3] [^1121zk4g].

> Finally, let me reconsider the core message to avoid overpromising any single modality: most patients with sciatica improve over time regardless of intervention, conservative care remains appropriate first-line management, epidural injections can provide short-term relief for selected patients, and surgery offers faster relief but similar long-term outcomes; aligning treatment choices with patient goals, symptom severity and chronicity, occupational demands, and risk tolerance is essential to high-quality care [^111F2Kgh] [^1121zk4g] [^113KCa4R].

---

Sciatica treatment should start with **conservative care** — activity, education, and NSAIDs — because most patients improve within 6–12 weeks [^117WVCEo]. If pain persists, **epidural steroid injections** can provide short-term relief [^1128dqir], but benefits are modest and transient [^111AUGZQ]. Surgery is reserved for **severe or progressive neurologic deficits** or **persistent pain** after 6–12 weeks of conservative care [^115EuZHV]; microdiscectomy offers faster relief but long-term outcomes are similar to non-surgical care [^114fxZpX]. Physical therapy and exercise are reasonable, though evidence is mixed [^117WRM8d]; **traction is not recommended** [^112aAyAt]. Acupuncture may help some patients but evidence is limited [^116zqjoi]. Treatment should be individualized, with shared decision-making and close follow-up to monitor for red flags and adjust the plan as needed [^117YC1dX].

---

## Conservative management

Conservative management is the **cornerstone of initial treatment** for sciatica, with most patients experiencing significant improvement within 6–12 weeks [^117WVCEo].

---

### Patient education and activity modification

Patient education should emphasize the **favorable natural history** of sciatica, the importance of remaining active, and avoidance of prolonged bed rest [^111F2Kgh] [^111neChg]. Activity modification encourages continuation of daily activities and avoidance of heavy lifting or prolonged sitting; **bed rest is discouraged** because it may prolong recovery and increase disability [^111G3YM5].

---

### Pharmacological interventions

- **NSAIDs**: First-line for pain and inflammation; modest benefit, with gastrointestinal and cardiovascular risks [^112sWKPY] [^112HUDiu].

- **Acetaminophen**: Alternative for mild pain or when NSAIDs are contraindicated [^1176aFTJ].

- **Muscle relaxants**: Short-term use for muscle spasms; sedation is common [^notfound].

- **Antidepressants/anticonvulsants**: Limited evidence; consider for neuropathic pain [^113vfXFD] [^112V8prL].

---

### Physical therapy and exercise

Physical therapy focuses on **core strengthening, flexibility, and posture training**; evidence is mixed but may improve pain and function [^117WRM8d]. Exercise programs emphasize regular, low-impact activity (walking, swimming) and targeted exercises to reduce pain and disability [^112Vkh5t].

---

### Alternative therapies

Acupuncture may provide short-term pain relief; evidence is limited and **not universally recommended** [^114Ask8U]. Spinal manipulation may benefit some patients but evidence is inconsistent; **use cautiously** in acute radiculopathy [^115Envnu].

---

## Interventional procedures

Interventional procedures are considered when **conservative measures fail** after 6–12 weeks or when pain significantly impairs function.

---

### Epidural steroid injections (ESIs)

ESIs provide **short-term relief** of leg pain and disability, with small-to-moderate effects at 2 weeks to 3 months [^1128dqir]; long-term benefits are limited [^1128dqir]. Risks include infection, bleeding, dural puncture, and transient symptom worsening [^notfound].

---

### Percutaneous disc decompression

Percutaneous disc decompression is a minimally invasive option for **selected patients with contained herniations**; evidence is limited and patient selection is critical.

---

## Surgical management

Surgery is indicated for **severe or progressive neurologic deficits**, cauda equina syndrome, or persistent pain despite 6–12 weeks of conservative care [^notfound].

---

### Microdiscectomy

Microdiscectomy provides **faster relief of leg pain and disability** than conservative care, with moderate short-term benefits and similar long-term outcomes [^114fxZpX] [^1121zk4g]. Risks include infection, bleeding, nerve injury, recurrent herniation, and chronic pain.

---

### Minimally invasive surgical techniques

Minimally invasive techniques (endoscopic discectomy, tubular microdiscectomy) have outcomes comparable to traditional microdiscectomy, with **potential benefits of reduced tissue trauma and faster recovery**, though evidence is limited [^113LsA6H].

---

## Emerging and experimental therapies

Emerging therapies such as **biologic agents** (e.g. anti-TNF-alpha) show limited benefit and are not routinely recommended [^116TvjZC]. Regenerative medicine remains investigational, with **insufficient evidence** for stem cell or platelet-rich plasma therapies.

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing treatment choice

- **Age and comorbidities**: Older patients or those with comorbidities may benefit from conservative care due to surgical risks.

- **Severity and duration of symptoms**: Severe or persistent symptoms may necessitate interventional or surgical treatment [^1117vs3T].

- **Patient preferences**: Shared decision-making is essential, considering patient values and goals [^117YC1dX].

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

Regular follow-up should track pain, function, and neurologic status, with **imaging reserved** for persistent or worsening symptoms [^113KCa4R]. Patient-reported outcomes should be assessed with validated tools (e.g. VAS, ODI) to guide care.

---

## Summary of treatment algorithm

| **Step** | **Treatment** | **Indication** |
|-|-|-|
| 1 | Conservative management (education, activity, NSAIDs) | Initial treatment for all patients |
| 2 | Physical therapy and exercise | Persistent symptoms after 6–12 weeks |
| 3 | Epidural steroid injections | Persistent radicular pain after conservative care |
| 4 | Surgical consultation | Severe or progressive neurologic deficits, or persistent pain after 6–12 weeks |
| 5 | Surgery (microdiscectomy) | Confirmed disc herniation with persistent symptoms |

---

Sciatica treatment should be **individualized**, beginning with conservative care and escalating to interventional or surgical options if symptoms persist. Shared decision-making and regular follow-up are essential to optimize outcomes [^1117vs3T].

### Are combined conservative interventions effective in reducing pain, disability and / or global rating of pain in people with sciatica with known neuropathic pain mechanisms? [^113bsyoP]. European Spine Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

National Clinical Guidelines recommend an integrated combination of conservative management strategies for sciatica. However, the efficacy of such combinations have not been established. The purpose of this systemic review with meta-analysis was to determine the efficacy of combined conservative (non-pharmacological) compared to single interventions for people with sciatica with a confirmed neuropathic mechanism.

Methods

The systematic review was registered on PROSPERO CRD42023464011. The databases included were the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), CINAHL (EBSCO), Embase, PubMed, Scopus, APA PsycINFO, and grey literature sources from inception until January 2024. Inclusion criteria were randomized controlled trials that assessed the effectiveness of combined non-pharmacological interventions in comparison to a control intervention among individuals with sciatica of a neuropathic origin identified using diagnostic or clinical tests. Primary outcomes were back pain, leg pain, and disability. The secondary outcome was global rating of change. Study selection, data extraction and risk of bias assessment (using Cochrane ROB2) were assessed by two reviewers. Meta-analysis was performed with a random effects model with inverse variance weighting used for the metanalysis using SPSS v 29.

Results

3,370 articles were identified, of which 6 were included. Risk of bias was high in one study and had some concerns in the remaining 5 studies for each outcome measure. There was evidence of efficacy for combined interventions for back pain in the short-and long-term (SMD -0.56 (95% CI -0.91, -0.22, p = 0.01, I² = 0.2; SMD -0.44 (95% CI -0.79, -0.1, p = 0.03, I² = 0.00), and for disability in the short term (SMD -0.48 (95% CI -0.92, -0.04, p = 0.04, I² = 0.72). There was no evidence of efficacy for leg pain at any time point ((short term SMD -0.45 (95% CI -0.91, 0.02, p = 0.06, I² = 0.65), medium term (SMD -0.29 (95% CI -1.12, 0.54, p = 0.35, I² = 0.82), long term (SMD -0.40 (95% CI -1.23, 0.44, p = 0.18, I² = 0.57). Certainty of evidence ranged from very low to moderate.

Conclusion

There are few studies that have combined conservative (non-pharmacological) interventions for the management of sciatica with a neuropathic component pain mechanism, as recommended by National Clinical Guidelines. This review indicates that combining conservative (no-pharmacological) management strategies appeared more effective than single interventions for the outcomes of low back pain in the short and long term, and for disability in the short term, but not for leg pain at any time point. The overall low certainty of evidence, suggests that future studies with more robust methodologies are needed.

### How effective are physiotherapy interventions in treating people with sciatica? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^117WRM8d]. European Spine Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Physiotherapy interventions are prescribed as first-line treatment for people with sciatica; however, their effectiveness remains controversial. The purpose of this systematic review was to establish the short-, medium- and long-term effectiveness of physiotherapy interventions compared to control interventions for people with clinically diagnosed sciatica.

Methods

This systematic review was registered on PROSPERO CRD42018103900. Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), CINAHL (EBSCO), Embase, PEDro, PubMed, Scopus and grey literature were searched from inception to January 2021 without language restrictions. Inclusion criteria were randomised controlled trials evaluating physiotherapy interventions compared to a control intervention in people with clinical or imaging diagnosis of sciatica. Primary outcome measures were pain and disability. Study selection and data extraction were performed by two independent reviewers with consensus reached by discussion or third-party arbitration if required. Risk of bias was assessed independently by two reviewers using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool with third-party consensus if required. Meta-analyses and sensitivity analyses were performed with random effects models using Revman v5.4. Subgroup analyses were undertaken to examine the effectiveness of physiotherapy interventions compared to minimal (e.g. advice only) or substantial control interventions (e.g. surgery).

Results

Three thousand nine hundred and fifty eight records were identified, of which 18 trials were included, with a total number of 2699 participants. All trials had a high or unclear risk of bias. Meta-analysis of trials for the outcome of pain showed no difference in the short (SMD -0.34 [95%CI -1.05, 0.37] p = 0.34, I² = 98%), medium (SMD 0.15 [95%CI -0.09, 0.38], p = 0.22, I² = 80%) or long term (SMD 0.09 [95%CI -0.18, 0.36], p = 0.51, I² = 82%). For disability there was no difference in the short (SMD -0.00 [95%CI -0.36, 0.35], p = 0.98, I² = 92%, medium (SMD 0.25 [95%CI -0.04, 0.55] p = 0.09, I² = 87%), or long term (SMD 0.26 [95%CI -0.16, 0.68] p = 0.22, I² = 92%) between physiotherapy and control interventions. Subgroup analysis of studies comparing physiotherapy with minimal intervention favoured physiotherapy for pain at the long-term time points. Large confidence intervals and high heterogeneity indicate substantial uncertainly surrounding these estimates. Many trials evaluating physiotherapy intervention compared to substantial intervention did not use contemporary physiotherapy interventions.

Conclusion

Based on currently available, mostly high risk of bias and highly heterogeneous data, there is inadequate evidence to make clinical recommendations on the effectiveness of physiotherapy interventions for people with clinically diagnosed sciatica. Future studies should aim to reduce clinical heterogeneity and to use contemporary physiotherapy interventions.

### Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for sciatica [^112sWKPY]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are one of the most frequently prescribed drugs for the treatment of sciatica. A previous Cochrane review on the efficacy of NSAIDs summarised findings for acute and chronic low back pain (LBP) and sciatica. This is an update of the original review (2008) focusing on people suffering from sciatica.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy of NSAIDs in pain reduction, overall improvement, and reported side effects in people with sciatica.

Search Methods

We performed electronic searches up to 24 June 2015 in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed, and two trials registers. We searched reference lists of included studies and relevant reviews on the topics for additional trials.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (double-blind, single-blind, and open-label) that assessed the efficacy of NSAIDs in sciatica. We included all trials that compared NSAIDs to placebo, to other NSAIDs, or to other medication. Additional interventions were allowed if there was a clear contrast for the treatment with NSAIDs in the trial.

Data Collection and Analysis

Three review authors independently assessed the risk of bias and extracted the data. Where feasible we calculated pooled results using Review Manager 5.3. We reported pain relief outcomes using mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). We used risk ratios (RR) with 95% CI to report global improvement of treatment, adverse effects, and additional medication. We performed a meta-analysis if possible. We assessed level of evidence using the GRADE approach. We used standard methodological procedures recommended by The Cochrane Collaboration.

Main Results

We included 10 trials reported in 9 publications (N = 1651). Only one trial out of 10 was assessed at low risk of bias. Five trials used the currently recommended daily dose for the drug, and two trials used lower daily doses available over the counter. Three trials investigated NSAIDs no longer approved for human use. The follow-up duration was short in all studies but one. Three trials (n = 918) compared the effects of NSAIDs to those of placebo on pain reduction. The pooled mean difference showed comparable pain reduction (visual analogue scale, 0 to 100) in the NSAIDs and placebo groups (MD -4.56, 95% CI -11.11 to 1.99). Heterogeneity was high (I 2 = 82%), and the quality of the evidence was very low. When we excluded one trial with a short follow-up of eight hours, the mean difference further decreased (MD -0.09, 95% CI -9.89 to 9.71). Three trials (n = 753) compared NSAIDs to placebo regarding global improvement. We found low-quality evidence that NSAIDs are more effective than placebo with a risk ratio of 1.14 (95% CI 1.03 to 1.27). One trial (n = 214) studied the effect of NSAIDs on disability, finding very low-quality evidence that NSAIDs are no more effective than placebo on disability. Four trials (n = 967) comparing NSAIDs to placebo reported adverse effects, with low-quality evidence that the risk for adverse effects is higher in the NSAID group than in the placebo group (RR 1.40, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.93). The adverse effects reported in this review are consistent with those previously reported in the literature.

Authors' Conclusions

This updated systematic review including 10 trials evaluating the efficacy of NSAIDs versus placebo or other drugs in people with sciatica reports low- to very low-level evidence using the GRADE criteria. The efficacy of NSAIDs for pain reduction was not significant. NSAIDs showed a better global improvement compared to placebo. These findings must be interpreted with caution, as the level of evidence according to the GRADE classification was very low for the outcome pain reduction and low for global improvement due to small study samples, inconsistent results, imprecision, and a high risk of bias in the included trials. While the trials included in the analysis were not powered to detect potential rare side effects, we found an increased risk for side effects in the short-term NSAIDs use. As NSAIDs are frequently prescribed, the risk-benefit ratio of prescribing the drug needs to be considered.

### How effective are physiotherapy interventions in treating people with sciatica? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^115wPE3n]. European Spine Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Apart from the possibility that physiotherapy is indeed not effective for patients with sciatica, there are multiple possible reasons for the lack of evidence. The physiotherapy interventions used in the 11 trials comparing physiotherapy with substantial interventions are not all considered contemporary in line with current clinical guidelines. This is a reflection of a lack of recent physiotherapy trials, with only four of the 11 studies published in the last decade. Current clinical guidelines recommend group exercise and continuation of normal activities; however, bedrest was a component of the conservative treatment arm in two trials. The UK NICE Guidelines find no evidence supporting the use of corsets or belts, but these were a core component in another trial conducted before publication of these guidelines. The physiotherapy interventions are highly heterogeneous and remain unclear in several studies. The Bailey study leaves physiotherapy interventions at the discretion of the treating clinician, and the Peul study refers people to physiotherapy only if they are fearful of movement, leaving uncertainty about how many participants in those trials had active physiotherapy treatment. It could also be argued that patients deemed suitable for surgery are likely to represent a specific subgroup that may be less amenable to physiotherapeutic interventions (e.g. with intractable pain or neurological deficit). Indeed, two trials comparing physiotherapy interventions with surgery included patients who had already failed conservative treatment, raising serious concerns that physiotherapy interventions could possibly succeed in such a population.

A further challenge to progress in treatment is the diagnosis of sciatica itself. There is no agreed definition for sciatica, reflected in the wide range of definitions used in clinical trials, including our review. The broad term 'sciatica' comprises radiculopathy, radicular pain, or somatic referred pain. The differing patient populations bring clinical heterogeneity to most meta-analyses. Unfortunately, the high heterogeneity among studies reduces the confidence in our results. Together with previous systematic reviews with inconclusive findings, our results question the value of continuing to perform clinical trials in heterogeneous groups of patients. Although subgrouping according to risk stratification showed promise in the management of people with non-specific low back pain, this has failed in patients with sciatica. Subgrouping using a mechanism-based approach shows promising signals in patients with neuropathic pain of different aetiologies, but has yet to be examined in sciatica.

### Surgical versus non-surgical treatment for sciatica: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^111F2Kgh]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Sciatica is a common condition with a lifetime prevalence of up to 43%. In approximately 85–90% of cases, a herniated disc causes lumbar nerve root compression or inflammation. Although the prognosis for patients with acute sciatica is generally favourable, 20–30% of patients still experience pain after a year.

Guidelines recommend a stepwise model of treatment for sciatica starting with non-surgical treatment such as exercise, then progressing to pharmacological and interventional treatment if the pain is refractory. When non-surgical treatments have not been effective, surgery can then be considered if radiological findings are consistent with symptoms. Discectomy is the most common surgical treatment for sciatica due to disc herniation. Around 180 000 discectomies are done in the United States per year, and an increasing trend in its use has been reported in many high-income countries over the past 20 years. However, evidence supporting surgical treatment for sciatica is uncertain.

Recent systematic reviews on this topic have several shortcomings. They have collated data from heterogeneous populations (eg, people with lumbar disc herniation, stenosis, and spondylolisthesis), which have distinct clinical courses and require different surgical procedures. Others have excluded studies published in languages other than English, newly published trials, and trials that compared surgery to other commonly used interventional treatments, such as epidural injections. Another network meta-analysis combined data from different time points. A nuanced interpretation of the outcomes for pain and disability was not given. Hence, current evidence supporting surgery for sciatica is undetermined and warrants a comprehensive update. The objective of this systematic review was to investigate the effectiveness or efficacy and safety of surgical treatment, compared with non-surgical treatment, in people with sciatica due to lumbar disc herniation.

### How effective are physiotherapy interventions in treating people with sciatica? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^111jg71Q]. European Spine Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

'Sciatica' is a broad term describing spinally referred pain of neural origin that radiates into the leg. The reported prevalence of sciatica varies widely (1.2–43%), probably due to different diagnostic criteria, reflecting a heterogeneous patient population. Sciatica is a significant burden to healthcare and the economy, as a neuropathic component in low back pain it is not only linked to poorer quality of life, but also increases the already high costs of back pain by a further 67%. Although prognosis is good for most patients, up to 45% continue to have symptoms for 12 months or longer.

Physiotherapy interventions such as exercise, manual therapy and psychological therapy are recommended in clinical guidelines for people with sciatica. However, the available systematic reviews examining the effectiveness of physiotherapy interventions are at least ten years old. For example, study selection in the most recent systematic review comparing surgery versus conservative care ended in 2009. Their results could not be meta-analysed due to poor reporting and clinical heterogeneity. Similarly, a network-meta-analysis concluded its search in 2009, finding no support for the effectiveness of exercise or traction while manipulation may be beneficial. However, the latter was based on a single study only. Prior to this, reviews specifically focusing on conservative management of sciatica were published in 2010 and 2007 and were unable to make strong conclusions on the superiority of any treatment. More recent reviews published in 2015 and 2016 were limited to a subset of physiotherapy interventions (e.g. physical activity versus surgery and exercise versus advice to stay active). A recent review looked at a range of physiotherapy interventions, however the review did not include a meta-analysis.

Of note, sciatica is a heterogeneous condition with no agreed diagnostic criteria. Most reviews to date make no reference to the clinical diagnosis of included study participants rendering it unclear whether patients had confirmed nerve involvement. The objective of this systematic review was therefore to assess the up-to-date evidence on the effectiveness of physiotherapy interventions compared with control interventions in people with clinically diagnosed sciatica.

### Advice to stay active as a single treatment for low back pain and sciatica [^111neChg]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Low back pain is one of the most common conditions managed in primary care. Restricted activity, rest, and symptomatic analgesics are the most commonly prescribed treatment for low back pain and sciatica.

Objectives

To assess the effects of advice to stay active as single treatment for patients with low back pain.

Search Strategy

Computerised searches in MEDLINE, EMBASE, Sport, The Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, Musculoskeletal Group's Trials Register and Scisearch, and scanning of reference lists from relevant articles were undertaken. Relevant studies were also traced by contacting authors. Date of the most recent searches: December 1998.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomised trials or quasi-randomised trials where the study population consisted of adult patients with low back pain or sciatica, in which one comparison group was advised to stay active. The main outcomes of interest were pain, functional status, recovery and return to work.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently selected trials for inclusion, assessed the validity of included trials and extracted data. Investigators were contacted to collect missing data or for clarification when needed.

Main Results

Four trials, with a total of 491 patients, were included. Advice to stay active was compared to advice to rest in bed in all trials. Two trials were assessed to have low risk of bias and two to have moderate to high risk of bias. The results were heterogeneous. Results from one high quality trial of patients with acute simple LBP found small differences in functional status [Weighted Mean Difference (on a 0–100 scale) 6.0 (95% CI: 1.5, 10.5)] and length of sick leave [WMD 3.4 days (95% CI: 1.6, 5.2)] in favour of staying active compared to advice to stay in bed for two days. The other high quality trial compared advice to stay active with advice to rest in bed for 14 days for patients with sciatic syndrome, and found no differences between the groups. One of the high quality trials also compared advice to stay active with exercises for patients with acute simple LBP, and found improvement in functional status and reduction in sick leave in favour of advice to stay active.

Reviewer's Conclusions

The best available evidence suggests that advice to stay active alone has small beneficial effects for patients with acute simple low back pain, and little or no effect for patients with sciatica. There is no evidence that advice to stay active is harmful for either acute low back pain or sciatica. If there is no major difference between advice to stay active and advice to rest in bed, and there is potential harmful effects of prolonged bed rest, then it is reasonable to advise people with acute low back pain and sciatica to stay active.

### Surgical versus non-surgical treatment for sciatica: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^1121zk4g]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To investigate the effectiveness and safety of surgery compared with non-surgical treatment for sciatica.

Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis.

Data Sources

Medline, Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organisation International Clinical Trials Registry Platform from database inception to June 2022.

Eligibility Criteria For Selecting Studies

Randomised controlled trials comparing any surgical treatment with non-surgical treatment, epidural steroid injections, or placebo or sham surgery, in people with sciatica of any duration due to lumbar disc herniation (diagnosed by radiological imaging).

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Two independent reviewers extracted data. Leg pain and disability were the primary outcomes. Adverse events, back pain, quality of life, and satisfaction with treatment were the secondary outcomes. Pain and disability scores were converted to a scale of 0 (no pain or disability) to 100 (worst pain or disability). Data were pooled using a random effects model. Risk of bias was assessed with the Cochrane Collaboration's tool and certainty of evidence with the grading of recommendations assessment, development, and evaluation (GRADE) framework. Follow-up times were into immediate term (≤ six weeks), short term (> six weeks and ≤ three months), medium term (> three and < 12 months), and long term (at 12 months).

Results

24 trials were included, half of these investigated the effectiveness of discectomy compared with non-surgical treatment or epidural steroid injections (1711 participants). Very low to low certainty evidence showed that discectomy, compared with non-surgical treatment, reduced leg pain: the effect size was moderate at immediate term (mean difference -12.1 (95% confidence interval -23.6 to -0.5)) and short term (-11.7 (-18.6 to -4.7)), and small at medium term (-6.5 (-11.0 to -2.1)). Negligible effects were noted at long term (-2.3 (-4.5 to -0.2)). For disability, small, negligible, or no effects were found. A similar effect on leg pain was found when comparing discectomy with epidural steroid injections. For disability, a moderate effect was found at short term, but no effect was observed at medium and long term. The risk of any adverse events was similar between discectomy and non-surgical treatment (risk ratio 1.34 (95% confidence interval 0.91 to 1.98)).

Conclusion

Very low to low certainty evidence suggests that discectomy was superior to non-surgical treatment or epidural steroid injections in reducing leg pain and disability in people with sciatica with a surgical indication, but the benefits declined over time. Discectomy might be an option for people with sciatica who feel that the rapid relief offered by discectomy outweighs the risks and costs associated with surgery.

### Surgical versus non-surgical treatment for sciatica: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^1117vs3T]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Implications for clinical practice and policy

International guidelines generally recommend surgical treatment for sciatica secondary to lumbar disc herniation if patients have not responded to comprehensive non-surgical treatment. These recommendations are because many people with acute sciatica will have improvements in their condition over time. Generally, our review supports these recommendations because non-surgical treatment was shown to be able to lead to similar outcomes at long term or even longer follow-ups. However, benefits could vary among different groups of people with sciatica. Attempts have been made to specify who might benefit more from early discectomy for people with sciatica. People with more severe pain in their leg and disability were shown to be more likely to have persistent and debilitating symptoms at 12 months. Thus, this subgroup might benefit from early discectomy because our review has shown that surgical treatment might lead to faster leg pain reduction. Added to that is the evidence that early discectomy is cost effective compared with prolonged non-surgical treatment in the context of the Dutch health system. These findings challenge the notion that non-surgical treatment should always be the first line treatment for sciatica. In people with sciatica who regard rapid pain relief as an important treatment goal, and who feel that the benefits of discectomy outweigh the risks and costs, discectomy could be an early management option.

As a result of the treatment's invasive nature and the substantial costs of surgery, we would encourage clinicians to discuss with their patients that discectomy can provide rapid relief of leg pain, but that non-surgical treatment can achieve similar results, although at a slower pace and with a potential chance of requiring delayed surgery if they do not respond to non-surgical treatment.

Future research

Although discectomy is widely used, the certainty of evidence supporting its use is only low to very low. All trials evaluating discectomy were not blinded and had high crossover rates. Evidence on plasma disc decompression and chemonucleolysis is limited by the low number of studies and small sample sizes. Large placebo controlled trials evaluating surgical treatment for sciatica have the potential to advance this field. However, the use of placebo controls in surgical trials has challenges. Furthermore, investigations into which group of people with sciatica are likely to benefit from early surgery is also key for clinicians to make individualised recommendations.

### Surgical versus non-surgical treatment for sciatica: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^111RNn9Z]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Methods

We prospectively registered this review on PROSPERO (CRD42021269997) and have followed the PRISMA reporting guidelines.

Data sources and searches

We searched Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization's International Clinical Trials Registry Platform from their database inception to June 2022 (supplemental file 1). We also tracked citations on relevant systematic reviews and included studies. Two authors independently screened titles and abstracts, then full text articles. Disagreements were resolved by consensus (supplemental file 2).

Eligibility criteria

We included randomised controlled trials in adults with sciatica of any duration due to a herniated disc (diagnosed through radiological examination). Eligible interventions were any surgical treatment using any approach, including open, micro, or endoscopic discectomy; percutaneous (plasma) disc decompression; and chemonucleolysis. Comparators were any non-surgical treatment, including non-pharmacological, pharmacological, interventional treatments (eg, epidural injection), or combinations of these. We deemed studies using placebo or sham surgeries as comparators as also eligible. Trials that reported data for pain, disability, or other outcomes of interest (see outcomes section for full details) were included. We did not restrict by language, geography, or publication date.

We excluded studies with mixed populations (eg, lumbar disc herniation and lumbar stenosis) if separate data for lumbar disc herniation could not be obtained. We also excluded studies that enrolled participants with lumbar disc herniation combined with spinal stenosis or spondylolisthesis or with any serious spinal pathologies (eg, infection, tumour, fractures, major trauma, systemic inflammatory diseases, or pregnancy related sciatica).

### Cost-effectiveness of different strategies to manage patients with sciatica [^1153ozow]. Pain (2014). Low credibility.

The aim of this paper is to estimate the relative cost-effectiveness of treatment regimens for managing patients with sciatica. A deterministic model structure was constructed based on information from the findings from a systematic review of clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness, published sources of unit costs, and expert opinion. The assumption was that patients presenting with sciatica would be managed through one of 3 pathways (primary care, stepped approach, immediate referral to surgery). Results were expressed as incremental cost per patient with symptoms successfully resolved. Analysis also included incremental cost per utility gained over a 12-month period. One-way sensitivity analyses were used to address uncertainty. The model demonstrated that none of the strategies resulted in 100% success. For initial treatments, the most successful regime in the first pathway was nonopioids, with a probability of success of 0.613. In the second pathway, the most successful strategy was nonopioids, followed by biological agents, followed by epidural/nerve block and disk surgery, with a probability of success of 0.996. Pathway 3 (immediate surgery) was not cost-effective. Sensitivity analyses identified that the use of the highest cost estimates results in a similar overall picture. While the estimates of cost per quality-adjusted life year are higher, the economic model demonstrated that stepped approaches based on initial treatment with nonopioids are likely to represent the most cost-effective regimens for the treatment of sciatica. However, development of alternative economic modelling approaches is required.

### The management of sciatica by acupuncture: an expert consensus using the improved Delphi survey [^113rnpc9]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

Acupuncture therapy is an effective non-drug therapy for sciatica, but it has not yet formed an effective treatment strategy and recommendations. Our objective was to establish an expert consensus on acupuncture treatment of sciatica for clinical guidance based on the improved Delphi survey.

Methods

A group of 80 clinical specialists was invited to participate in two rounds of semi-open clinical issue investigation. At the same time, the PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases were searched for systematic reviews on acupuncture treatment of sciatica, and the quality of evidence was evaluated. Then the three-round Delphi survey was undertaken with 30 experts based on the clinical issue investigation and systematic reviews.

Results

In round 1 of the Delphi survey, the experts evaluated 17 items identified from the results of the clinical investigation and literature review. The criterion for achieving consensus was a threshold of 80% agreement. After the three-round Delphi survey, 16 items (94.12%) achieved consensus, including 5 domains: the principle of acupuncture treatment for sciatica; the "dose" of acupuncture; the clinical effects of acupuncture; the adverse effects, and others.

Conclusion

This Delphi survey achieved an expert consensus on key items in the management of sciatica for acupuncture, which provides the current opinions in China. We trust that these treatment recommendations may facilitate their implementation in the future.

### The management of sciatica by acupuncture: an expert consensus using the improved Delphi survey [^1144ccza]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Pain is the most common symptom of sciatica. As an emotional experience, it was defined as unpleasant feelings and emotional experiences related to actual or potential damage, or described by such damage. A recommendation from the Initiative on Methods, Measurement, and Pain Assessment in Clinical Trials (IMMPACT) that six-core outcome domains for the design of chronic pain clinical trials should be considered, including emotional functioning. Patients with chronic pain are prone to mental disorders and aggravate the psychological burden. In our consensus content, we also reached a consensus on the mental state. In the future clinical research for acupuncture treatment of sciatica, we must also pay attention to mental functioning.

Unlike conventional medical treatment, whether acupuncture can be effective for sciatica may be related to "dose". Based on traditional Chinese acupuncture theory, the number of acupuncture points, the selection of acupoints, the frequency of treatment, and the time of needle retention are the key factors to achieve the best treatment effect. A randomized controlled pilot study of the dose-effect of acupuncture on sciatica found that the number of acupuncture points (ie, dose) may play a key role in pain relief. The "low-dose" manual acupuncture (MAL) treatment group, which involved six acupoints, was as effective as the "high-dose" manual acupuncture (MAH) treatment group, which involved 18 acupoints in treating sciatica. However, the possible dose-related response has not been fully explored in sciatica. Therefore, we formulate consensus items on the parameters required for the effect of acupuncture intervention and finally reach recommendations on certain items, including the frequency of acupuncture treatment, needle holding time, and treatment time.

### Therapeutic efficacy and the impact of the "Dose" effect of acupuncture to treat sciatica: a randomized controlled pilot study [^114arBd1]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Considering that acupuncture is more effective in treating sciatica than traditional treatments; we investigated the dose effect of acupuncture and observed the impact of pain chronicity. We hypothesized that, if acupuncture therapy is effective for pain relief in chronic sciatica, the number of acupoints (ie, dosage) may have a crucial role in pain relief. We also investigated the efficacy of acupuncture in treating sciatica and the impact of pain duration on treatment outcome.

### The management of sciatica by acupuncture: an expert consensus using the improved Delphi survey [^117TkH7a]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In conclusion, this consensus statement was in agreement that the treatment of acupuncture was an essential part of sciatica treatment and provided a useful tool for physicians to facilitate individualized treatment decisions regarding the management of sciatica. At the same time, due to the large individual differences of patients, our consensus is only a method to provide a new perspective for future clinical research on the effectiveness of acupuncture.

### Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for sciatica: an updated cochrane review [^112HUDiu]. Spine (2017). Low credibility.

Study Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis.

Objective

To determine the efficacy of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) on pain reduction, overall improvement, and reported adverse effects in people with sciatica.

Summary Of Background Data

NSAIDs are one of the most frequently prescribed drugs for sciatica.

Methods

We updated a 2008 Cochrane Review through June 2015. Randomized controlled trials that compared NSAIDs with placebo, with other NSAIDs, or with other medication were included. Outcomes included pain using mean difference (MD, 95% confidence intervals [95% CI]). For global improvement and adverse effects risk ratios (RR, 95% CI) were used. We assessed level of evidence using the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach.

Results

Ten trials were included (N = 1651). Nine out of 10 trials were assessed at high risk of bias. For pain reduction (visual analog scale, 0 to 100) NSAIDs were no more effective than placebo (MD -4.56, 95% CI -11.11 to 1.99, quality of evidence: very low). For global improvement NSAIDs were more effective than placebo (RR 1.14 [95% CI 1.03 to 1.27], low quality of evidence). One trial reported the effect of NSAIDs on disability with very low-quality evidence that NSAIDs are no more effective than placebo. There was low-quality evidence that the risk for adverse effects is higher for NSAID than placebo (RR 1.40, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.93).

Conclusion

Our findings show very low-quality evidence that the efficacy of NSAIDs for pain reduction is comparable with that of placebo, low-quality evidence that NSAIDs is better than placebo for global improvement and low-quality evidence for higher risk of adverse effects using NSAIDs compared with placebo. The findings must be interpreted with caution, due to small study samples, inconsistent results, and a high risk of bias in the included trials.

### A systematic review and meta-analysis of biological treatments targeting tumour necrosis factor α for sciatica [^116TvjZC]. European Spine Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

Systematic review comparing biological agents, targeting tumour necrosis factor α, for sciatica with placebo and alternative interventions.

Methods

We searched 21 electronic databases and bibliographies of included studies. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), non-RCTs and controlled observational studies of adults who had sciatica treated by biological agents compared with placebo or alternative interventions.

Results

We pooled the results of six studies (five RCTs and one non-RCT) in meta-analyses. Compared with placebo biological agents had: better global effects in the short-term odds ratio (OR) 2.0 (95% CI 0.7–6.0), medium-term OR 2.7 (95% CI 1.0–7.1) and long-term OR 2.3 [95% CI 0.5 to 9.7); improved leg pain intensity in the short-term weighted mean difference (WMD) -13.6 (95% CI -26.8 to -0.4), medium-term WMD -7.0 (95% CI -15.4 to 1.5), but not long-term WMD 0.2 (95% CI -20.3 to 20.8); improved Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) in the short-term WMD -5.2 (95% CI -14.1 to 3.7), medium-term WMD -8.2 (95% CI -14.4 to -2.0), and long-term WMD -5.0 (95% CI -11.8 to 1.8). There was heterogeneity in the leg pain intensity and ODI results and improvements were no longer statistically significant when studies were restricted to RCTs. There was a reduction in the need for discectomy, which was not statistically significant, and no difference in the number of adverse effects.

Conclusions

There was insufficient evidence to recommend these agents when treating sciatica, but sufficient evidence to suggest that larger RCTs are needed.

### Early surgery for sciatica [^111dfzmK]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

International guidelines for sciatica recommend a stepped care approach starting with conservative management (ie, physiotherapy and medication), escalating to steroid injections, then surgery when non-surgical treatment has failed or when major radicular weakness is present. Unfortunately, evidence on the effectiveness of both non-surgicaland surgical options is uncertain.

In a linked paper, Liu and colleagues (doi:) report a methodologically sound and balanced systematic review and meta-analysis of 24 randomised clinical trials evaluating the evidence of surgical care for people with sciatica due to lumbar disc herniation. Their meta-analysis suggests that discectomy is statistically significantly superior to non-surgical treatment in reducing leg pain and disability. However, effects were moderate at best (10–20 point reduction on a 100 point scale), but mostly small (5–10 point reduction). The benefits of discectomy were only evident in the short to medium term, with no clinically meaningful effects beyond 12 months.

### The cochrane review of advice to stay active as a single treatment for low back pain and sciatica [^111G3YM5]. Spine (2002). Low credibility.

Study Design

A systematic review was conducted within the Cochrane Collaboration Back Review Group.

Objectives

To assess the effects of advice to stay active as a single treatment for patients with acute low back pain or sciatica.

Summary Of Background Data

Low back pain is a common reason for consulting a health care provider, and advice on daily activities constitutes an important part in the primary care management of low back pain.

Methods

All randomized studies available in systematic searches (electronic databases, contact with authors, reference lists) were included. Two reviewers independently selected trials for inclusion, assessed the validity of the included trials, and extracted data. Investigators were contacted to obtain missing information.

Results

Four trials, with a total of 491 patients, were included. In all the trials, advice to stay active was compared with advice for bed rest. Two trials were assessed as having a low risk of bias, and two as having a moderate to high risk of bias. The results were heterogeneous. The results from one high-quality trial of patients with acute, simple low back pain found small differences in functional status (weighted mean difference on a 0 to 100 scale, 6.0; 95% CI, 1.5–10.5) and length of sick leave (weighted mean difference, 3.4 days; 95% CI, 1.6–5.2) in favor of staying active, as compared with advice to stay in bed 2 days. The other high-quality trial compared advice to stay active with advice to rest in bed 14 days for patients with sciatic syndrome, and found no differences between the groups. One of the high-quality trials also compared advice to stay active with advice to engage in exercises for patients with acute, simple low back pain, and found improvement in functional status and reduced sick leave in favor of advice to stay active.

Conclusion

The best available evidence suggests that advice to stay active alone has little beneficial effect for patients with acute, simple low back pain, and little or no effect for patients with sciatica. There is no evidence that advice to stay active is harmful for either acute low back pain or sciatica. Because there is no considerable difference between advice to stay active and advice for bed rest, and there are potential harmful effects of prolonged bed rest, it is reasonable to advise people with acute low back pain and sciatica to stay active. These conclusions are based on single trials.

### Drugs for relief of pain in patients with sciatica: systematic review and meta-analysis [^111jfPh3]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

There is at best only low quality evidence to judge the efficacy and tolerability of drugs commonly prescribed for the management of sciatica in primary care. The available evidence does not clearly show favourable effects of NSAIDs, corticosteroids, antidepressants, or opioid analgesics in the immediate term, even compared with placebo. Evidence from a single trial and one meta-analysis with two trials provides some limited support ("low quality" and "moderate quality" evidence) for the use of NSAIDs and corticosteroids to relieve pain in the short term in patients with acute sciatica. In one small sample trial there was also limited support ("low quality" evidence) for the short term relief of pain in chronic sciatica with an anticonvulsant drug. At present these data provide a lack of conclusive and high quality evidence to guide the prescription of these drugs for patients with sciatica in primary care.

### Drugs for relief of pain in patients with sciatica: systematic review and meta-analysis [^115rtBDN]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Objective To investigate the efficacy and tolerability of analgesic and adjuvant pain drugs typically administered in primary care for the management of patients with sciatica.

Design Systematic review.

Data source International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, PsycINFO, Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Clinical Trials (CENTRAL), CINAHL, and LILACS.

Study selection Randomised controlled trials assessing the efficacy and tolerability of drugs versus placebo or other treatment for sciatica.

Data extraction Two independent reviewers extracted data and assessed methodological quality using the PEDro scale. Pain and disability outcomes were converted to a common 0 to 100 scale. Data were pooled with a random effects model, and the GRADE approach was used in summary conclusions.

Results Twenty three published reports met the inclusion criteria. The evidence to judge the efficacy of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), corticosteroids, antidepressants, anticonvulsants, muscle relaxants, and opioid analgesics ranged from moderate to low quality. Most of the pooled estimates did not favour the active treatment over placebo. The pooled results of two trials of corticosteroids (mean difference in overall and leg pain −12.2, 95% confidence interval −20.9 to −3.4) and a single trial of the anticonvulsant gabapentin for chronic sciatica (mean difference in overall pain relief −26.6, −38.3 to −14.9) showed some benefits but only in the short term. The median rate of adverse events was 17% (interquartile range 10–30%) for the active drugs and 11% (3–23%) for placebo. Trial limitations included failure to use validated outcome measures, lack of long term follow-up, and small sample size.

Conclusions As the existing evidence from clinical trials is of low quality, the efficacy and tolerability of drugs commonly prescribed for the management of sciatica in primary care is unclear.

### Sciatica: what the rheumatologist needs to know [^113KCa4R]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2010). Medium credibility.

Sciatica is a set of symptoms rather than a specific diagnosis, and is caused by a herniated lumbar disc in the vast majority of cases. The most important symptom is lower limb pain radiating below the knee and into the foot and toes. The clinical course of acute sciatica is generally favorable, with most pain and related disability improving within 2–4 weeks with or without treatment. Diagnosis mainly involves history taking and physical examination. Imaging is warranted if there is evidence of an underlying pathology other than disc herniation, such as infection or malignancy, and in patients with severe symptoms that do not improve after 6–8 weeks of conservative treatment. MRI is the preferred imaging modality, as it can visualize soft tissues better than CT and does not expose the patient to ionizing radiation. Conservative treatment is generally the first-line option in patients with sciatica; however, the currently available evidence does not show any intervention — including a broad range of conservative and surgical approaches — to have clearly superior outcomes. Thus, patient preference seems to be an important factor in the clinical management of sciatica.

### Epidural corticosteroid injections in the management of sciatica: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1128dqir]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Existing guidelines and systematic reviews provide inconsistent recommendations on epidural corticosteroid injections for sciatica. Key limitations of existing reviews are the inclusion of trials with active controls of unknown efficacy and failure to provide an estimate of the size of the treatment effect.

Purpose

To determine the efficacy of epidural corticosteroid injections for sciatica compared with placebo.

Data Sources

International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, PsycINFO, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and CINAHL.

Study Selection

Randomized, placebo-controlled trials assessing the efficacy of epidural corticosteroid injections in participants with sciatica.

Data Extraction

Two independent reviewers extracted data and assessed risk of bias. Leg pain, back pain, and disability were converted to common scales from 0 (no pain or disability) to 100 (worst possible pain or disability). Thresholds for clinically important change in the range of 10 to 30 have been proposed for these outcomes. Effects were calculated for short-term (> 2 weeks but ≤ 3 months) and long-term (≥ 12 months) follow-up.

Data Synthesis

Data were pooled with a random-effects model, and the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach was used in summary conclusions. Twenty-five published reports (23 trials) were included. The pooled results showed a significant, although small, effect of epidural corticosteroid injections compared with placebo for leg pain in the short term (mean difference, -6.2 [95% CI, -9.4 to -3.0]) and also for disability in the short term (mean difference, -3.1 [CI, -5.0 to -1.2]). The long-term pooled effects were smaller and not statistically significant. The overall quality of evidence according to the GRADE classification was rated as high.

Limitation

The review included only English-language trials and could not incorporate dichotomous outcome measures into the analysis.

Conclusion

The available evidence suggests that epidural corticosteroid injections offer only short-term relief of leg pain and disability for patients with sciatica. The small size of the treatment effects, however, raises questions about the clinical utility of this procedure in the target population.

Primary Funding Source

None.

### Drugs for relief of pain in patients with sciatica: systematic review and meta-analysis [^115VyQ8n]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Although the knowledge of evidence about surgery has changed in the past decade, we still do not know much about a simpler conservative treatment such as pharmacological interventions for sciatica. A recent clinical practice guideline from the American Pain Societyrecommends that surgery should be considered as a treatment option for persistent and disabling radicular pain caused by a herniated lumbar disc. This recommendation relies on moderate short term benefits from large randomised clinical trials such as those by Peul et aland Weinstein et al, with 283 and 501 patients randomised, respectively. At present, there is a limited number of mainly small trials of pharmacological interventions with typically short term follow-up. For example, the evidence to support the use of anticonvulsants in chronic sciatica arises from a single trial with only 50 participants.

Our principal finding is that there is insufficient evidence to confidently guide the use of any analgesic or adjuvant pain medicine for the effective management of pain and disability in patients with sciatica. Until this changes, we would advise clinicians treating such patients who exhibit clinical features of neuropathic pain to consider evidence based guidelines for neuropathic painand for other patients with sciatica to consider therapeutic recommendations from current guidelines for the management of non-specific low back pain.

### Drugs for relief of pain in patients with sciatica: systematic review and meta-analysis [^113RTpwW]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To investigate the efficacy and tolerability of analgesic and adjuvant pain drugs typically administered in primary care for the management of patients with sciatica.

Design

Systematic review. Data source International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, PsycINFO, Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Clinical Trials (CENTRAL), CINAHL, and LILACS.

Study Selection

Randomised controlled trials assessing the efficacy and tolerability of drugs versus placebo or other treatment for sciatica.

Data Extraction

Two independent reviewers extracted data and assessed methodological quality using the PEDro scale. Pain and disability outcomes were converted to a common 0 to 100 scale. Data were pooled with a random effects model, and the GRADE approach was used in summary conclusions.

Results

Twenty three published reports met the inclusion criteria. The evidence to judge the efficacy of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), corticosteroids, antidepressants, anticonvulsants, muscle relaxants, and opioid analgesics ranged from moderate to low quality. Most of the pooled estimates did not favour the active treatment over placebo. The pooled results of two trials of corticosteroids (mean difference in overall and leg pain -12.2, 95% confidence interval -20.9 to -3.4) and a single trial of the anticonvulsant gabapentin for chronic sciatica (mean difference in overall pain relief -26.6, -38.3 to -14.9) showed some benefits but only in the short term. The median rate of adverse events was 17% (interquartile range 10–30%) for the active drugs and 11% (3–23%) for placebo. Trial limitations included failure to use validated outcome measures, lack of long term follow-up, and small sample size.

Conclusions

As the existing evidence from clinical trials is of low quality, the efficacy and tolerability of drugs commonly prescribed for the management of sciatica in primary care is unclear.

### Timing of surgery for sciatica: subgroup analysis alongside a randomized trial [^111j13Zw]. European Spine Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Except for absent "sciatica provoked by sitting" early surgery compared to prolonged conservative care yielded significantly faster rates of recovery for all investigated variables, irrespective of their value. Neurological signs, patient preferences and MRI findings fail to affect the outcome of early surgery versus prolonged conservative care. A simple question might help patients and spinal surgeons to decide for the optimal "timing of surgery" strategy.

Conservative management of sciatica usually includes interventions to promote physical activity in the form of advice to stay active or exercise, but there has been no systematic review directly comparing the effectiveness of these 2 approaches.

Methods

Data Sources included MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, and PEDro databases. Studies were randomized controlled trials comparing advice with exercise. Two independent reviewers extracted data and assessed methodological quality using the PEDro scale. Pain and disability data were extracted for all time points and converted to a common 0 to 100 scale. Data were pooled with a random effects model for short, intermediate, and long-term follow-ups. The GRADE approach was used to summarize the strength of evidence.

Results

Five trials were included in the meta-analysis, which showed a significant, although small effect favoring exercise over advice for reducing leg pain intensity in the short term (weighted mean difference: 11.43 [95% confidence interval, 0.71–22.16]) but no difference for disability (weighted mean difference: 1.45 [95% confidence interval, -2.86 to 5.76]). Furthermore, there was no difference at intermediate and long-term follow-ups between advice and exercise for patient-relevant outcomes.

Conclusion

There is low-quality evidence (GRADE) that exercise provides small, superior effects compared with advice to stay active on leg pain in the short term for patients experiencing sciatica. However, there is moderate-quality evidence showing no difference between advice to stay active and exercise on leg pain and disability status in people with sciatica in the long term.

### Surgery versus conservative management of sciatica due to a lumbar herniated disc: a systematic review [^115EuZHV]. European Spine Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Management of sciatica varies considerably. Patients are commonly treated in primary care but a small proportion is referred to secondary care and may eventually undergo surgery if complaints remain present for at least 6 weeks. Conservative treatment for sciatica is primarily aimed at pain reduction, either by analgesics or by reducing pressure on the nerve root. There seems to be consensus that surgery is indicated in carefully selected patients for sciatica in presence of a herniated lumbar disc, or severe sciatica with serious or progressive neurologic deficits and imaging demonstrating lumbar disc herniation at the nerve root level correlating with the patient's examination findings. The primary rationale of surgery for sciatica is that surgery will relieve nerve root irritation or compression due to herniated disc material. The most common type of surgery is open microdiscectomy, surgical removal of part of the disc, performed with or without the use of an operating microscope or other magnifying tools. Other minimally invasive surgical techniques, such as endoscopic surgery have recently been developed. In the absence of serious neurologic deficits or for persistent non-radicular low back pain, consensus whether surgery is useful or not has not yet been established. Furthermore, the timing of the intervention with respect to prolonged conservative care has not been evaluated properly.

At present, several randomised trials have been published that have compared surgery with conservative treatment. The objective of this systematic review is to compare and summarise the evidence regarding the effectiveness of surgery compared with conservative treatment for patients with sciatica due to lumbar disc herniation.

### The management of sciatica by acupuncture: an expert consensus using the improved Delphi survey [^111intyj]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The purpose of this study is to establish a consensus based on the consensus of experts to determine the common clinical influencing factors and the best acupuncture parameters for acupuncture treatment of sciatica. The results showed that acupuncture therapy may have a satisfactory effect in improving sciatica. Nearly 90% of experts believe that the current acupuncture treatment can improve the pain and function of sciatica regardless of the severity of the disease that is to minimize the impact of sciatica on patients' life treatment. Although some terms specific to "traditional Chinese medicine" are included in the consensus items, the consensus result still has certain practicability and promotion significance.

According to the final consensus, acupuncture is recommended to improve the clinical symptoms for mild, moderate, and severe sciatica caused by the lumbar disc herniation. This consensus is similar to some previous research results. A single-center, parallel, randomized controlled trial involving 46 patients with sciatica pain for at least 12 weeks found that acupuncture was safer than sham acupuncture in treating chronic sciatica and had a curative effect in improving short-term pain. Two systematic reviews (one included 12 RCTs, 1842 patients; another included 11 RCTs, 932 patients) showed that acupuncture might be more effective in treating sciatica than drug therapy in relieving leg pain.

### The management of sciatica by acupuncture: an expert consensus using the improved Delphi survey [^116RjcAy]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

According to Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) theory, syndrome differentiation including eight principles, Zang-fu, meridians, Qi and Blood, or Triple-Energizer, is one of the basic principles of individual diagnosis and treatment of acupuncture. In TCM, acupoints are a special part of the body's viscera meridians and blood transfusion. The meridian system is the channel through which qi and blood flow. In the practice of acupuncture, the corresponding acupoints should be selected according to the meridian differentiation. In this study, we reached the consensus that acupuncture treatment of sciatica should pay attention to syndrome differentiation and meridian syndrome differentiation, which reflects the uniqueness of TCM theory, and thus guarantees the efficacy of acupuncture treatment.

Although what is the optimal treatment method has always been the focus of acupuncture practitioners, however, due to the lack of sufficient evidence to promote the routine use of acupuncture treatment, there are many debates about acupuncture treatment of sciatica, partly because there is not enough high-quality evidence to fully explore possible dose-related responses. Therefore, after extensively soliciting the suggestions and opinions of multiple clinicians, our study formulated an expert consensus around the clinical-specific problems for acupuncture treatment of sciatica based on systematic review evidence.

### Drugs for relief of pain in patients with sciatica: systematic review and meta-analysis [^111TFJhh]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

The clinical syndrome of sciatica has been recognised since ancient times. Currently believed to arise from a disorder of the nerve root, the syndrome is known by a range of synonyms such as lumbosacral radicular syndrome, nerve root compromise, nerve root pain, and nerve root entrapment or irritation. Sciatica is considered to be a prognostic indicator of poor outcome among patients with low back painwith a substantial proportion continuing to have persistent pain for two years or longer. The annual prevalence of sciatica is estimated to be between 14%and 2%. While there are a range of definitions of sciatica, the key clinical features that can help clinicians to distinguish it from non-specific low back pain include unilateral leg pain that is worse than the low back pain, pain radiating below the knee, presence of numbness or pins and needles in a dermatomal distribution, positive results on a straight leg raise test, and weakness or reflex changes, or both, in a myotomal distribution.

Analgesic and adjuvant pain drugs are often prescribed for patients with sciatica. Patients with a clinical diagnosis of sciatica are about five times more likely to take drugs than those with low back pain only. Drugs commonly prescribed for the management of sciatica include non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), skeletal muscle relaxants, opioid analgesics, benzodiazepines, systemic corticosteroids, antidepressants, and anticonvulsants. While guidelines provide clear and generally consistent recommendations for the prescription of drugs for non-specific low back pain, this is not the case for sciatica.

At present the efficacy and tolerability of commonly prescribed analgesic and adjuvant drugs for the management of patients with sciatica has not been established. The problem is that there are no reviews that specifically focus on these drugs that are used in primary care to manage sciatica. Because most guidelines recommend a course of conservative care before surgery is considered, it is imperative to understand what best practice conservative care should entail. In this systematic review we determined the efficacy and tolerability of analgesic and adjuvant pain drugs typically administered in primary care (orally, topically, or parentally) in the management of patients with sciatica when compared with other treatment options or no treatment.

### Efficacy and safety of acupuncture and acupuncture-combined therapies in the treatment of sciatica caused by lumbar disc herniation: a network meta-analysis [^117FJgPV]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

A recent meta-analysis evaluated the efficacy and safety of acupuncture in the treatment of sciatica, concluding that acupuncture is both effective and safe. However, acupuncture encompasses various techniques, such as fire acupuncture (FA), warm acupuncture (WA), needle knife (NK), and electrostimulation (ES), each of which has demonstrated efficacy to some extent. The foregoing meta-analysis focused solely on pairwise comparisons between two interventions at a time and did not account for the complexity and diversity of available therapeutic strategies. Therefore, the optimal approach for managing sciatica secondary to LDH in clinical practice remains unclear.

Network meta-analysis (NMA), by integrating both direct and indirect evidence across multiple interventions, allows for comprehensive comparative evaluations. This method facilitates a nuanced understanding of the relative efficacy and safety of diverse therapeutic options and aids in identifying the most favorable treatment strategies. To date, no systematic evaluation has been conducted to compare the effectiveness and safety of different acupuncture modalities for sciatica caused by LDH. Therefore, this study employed an NMA to assess the comparative efficacy of various acupuncture monotherapies, acupuncture versus conventional rehabilitation therapies, and acupuncture monotherapy versus combination treatments for LDH-induced sciatica. The aim is to provide robust, evidence-based recommendations to inform clinical decision-making and optimize acupuncture-based treatment strategies.

### Surgery or physical activity in the management of sciatica: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115bRoxp]. European Spine Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

Previous reviews have compared surgical to non-surgical management of sciatica, but have overlooked the specific comparison between surgery and physical activity-based interventions.

Methods

Systematic review using MEDLINE, CINAHL, Embase and PEDro databases was conducted. Randomised controlled trials comparing surgery to physical activity, where patients were experiencing the three most common causes of sciatica-disc herniation, spondylolisthesis and spinal stenosis. Two independent reviewers extracted pain and disability data (converted to a common 0–100 scale) and assessed methodological quality using the PEDro scale. The size of the effects was estimated for each outcome at three different time points, with a random effects model adopted and the GRADE approach used in summary conclusions.

Results

Twelve trials were included. In the short term, surgery provided better outcomes than physical activity for disc herniation: disability [WMD -9.00 (95% CI -13.73, -4.27)], leg pain [WMD -16.01 (95% CI -23.00, -9.02)] and back pain [WMD -12.44 (95% CI -17.76, -7.09)]; for spondylolisthesis: disability [WMD -14.60 (95% CI -17.12, -12.08)], leg pain [WMD -35.00 (95% CI -39.66, -30.34)] and back pain [WMD -20.00 (95% CI -24.66, -15.34)] and spinal stenosis: disability [WMD -11.39 (95% CI -17.31, -5.46)], leg pain [WMD, -27.17 (95% CI -35.87, -18.46)] and back pain [WMD -20.80 (95% CI -25.15, -16.44)]. Long-term and greater than 2-year post-randomisation results favoured surgery for spondylolisthesis and stenosis, although the size of the effects reduced with time. For disc herniation, no significant effect was shown for leg and back pain comparing surgery to physical activity.

Conclusion

There are indications that surgery is superior to physical activity-based interventions in reducing pain and disability for disc herniation at short-term follow-up only; but high-quality evidence in this field is lacking (GRADE). For spondylolisthesis and spinal stenosis, surgery is superior to physical activity up to greater than 2 years follow-up. Results should guide clinicians and patients when facing the difficult decision of having surgery or engaging in active care interventions. PROSPERO registration number: CRD42013005746.

### Traction for low-back pain with or without sciatica [^114SVTZ4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Traction is used to treat low-back pain (LBP), often with other treatments.

Objectives

To determine traction's effectiveness, compared to reference treatments, placebo, sham traction or no treatment for LBP.

Search Strategy

We searched CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2006, issue 4), MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL to October 2006, references in relevant reviews and personal files.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving traction to treat acute (less than four weeks duration), sub-acute (four to 12 weeks) or chronic (more than 12 weeks) non-specific LBP with or without sciatica.

Data Collection and Analysis

Study selection, methodological quality assessment and data extraction were done independently by two authors. As there were insufficient data for statistical pooling, we performed a qualitative analysis.

Main Results

We included 25 RCTs (2206 patients; 1045 receiving traction). Five trials were considered high quality. For patients with mixed symptom patterns (acute, sub-acute and chronic LBP with and without sciatica) there is: strong evidence of no statistically significant difference in outcomes between traction as a single treatment and placebo, sham or no treatment; moderate evidence that traction as a single treatment is no more effective than other treatments; limited evidence of no significant difference in outcomes between a standard physical therapy program with or without continuous traction. For LBP patients with sciatica (with acute, sub-acute or chronic pain), there is conflicting evidence in several comparisons: autotraction compared to placebo, sham or no treatment; other forms of traction compared to other treatments; different forms of traction. In other comparisons, there were no statistically significant differences; the evidence is moderate for continuous or intermittent traction compared to placebo, sham or no treatment, and limited for light versus normal force traction.

Implications For Practice

The results of the available studies involving mixed groups of acute, sub-acute and chronic patients with LBP with and without sciatica were quite consistent, indicating that continuous or intermittent traction as a single treatment for LBP is not likely effective for this group. Traction for patients with sciatica cannot be judged effective at present either, due to inconsistent results and methodological problems in most studies. We conclude that traction as a single treatment for LBP is probably not effective.

Implications For Research

Any future research on traction for patients with LBP should distinguish between symptom pattern and duration, and should be carried out according to the highest methodological standards.

### Traction for low back pain with or without sciatica: an updated systematic review within the framework of the cochrane collaboration [^113gaijj]. Spine (2006). Low credibility.

Study Design

Systematic review.

Objective

To determine if traction is more effective than reference treatments, placebo/sham traction, or no treatment for low back pain (LBP).

Summary Of Background Data

Various types of traction are used in the treatment of LBP, often in conjunction with other treatments.

Methods

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL to November 2004, and screened the latest issue of the Cochrane Library (2004, issue 4) and references in relevant reviews and our personal files. We selected randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving any type of traction for the treatment of acute (less than 4 weeks duration), subacute (4–12 weeks), or chronic (more than 12 weeks) nonspecific LBP with or without sciatica. Sets of 2 reviewers independently performed study selection, methodological quality assessment, and data extraction. Because available studies did not provide sufficient data for statistical pooling, we performed a qualitative "levels of evidence" analysis, systematically estimating the strength of the cumulative evidence on the difference/lack of difference observed in trial outcomes.

Results

A total of 24 RCTs (2177 patients) were included. There were 5 trials considered high quality. For mixed groups of patients with LBP with and without sciatica, we found: (1) strong evidence that there is no statistically significant difference in short or long-term outcomes between traction as a single treatment, (continuous or intermittent) and placebo, sham, or no treatment; (2) moderate evidence that traction as a single treatment is no more effective than other treatments; and (3) limited evidence that adding traction to a standard physiotherapy program does not result in significantly different outcomes. For LBP with sciatica, we found conflicting evidence in several of the comparisons: autotraction compared to placebo, sham, or no treatment; other forms of traction compared to other treatments; and different forms of traction. In the remaining comparisons, there were no statistically significant differences; level of evidence is moderate regarding continuous or intermittent traction compared to placebo, sham, or no treatment, and is limited regarding different forms of traction.

Conclusion

Based on the current evidence, intermittent or continuous traction as a single treatment for LBP cannot be recommended for mixed groups of patients with LBP with and without sciatica. Neither can traction be recommended for patients with sciatica because of inconsistent results and methodological problems in most of the studies involved. However, because high-quality studies within the field are scarce, because many are underpowered, and because traction often is supplied in combination with other treatment modalities, the literature allows no firm negative conclusion that traction, in a generalized sense, is not an effective treatment for patients with LBP.

### Therapeutic efficacy and the impact of the "Dose" effect of acupuncture to treat sciatica: a randomized controlled pilot study [^116zqjoi]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Sciatica is a common and bothersome medical problem. It typically presents as unilateral gluteal pain that may involve one leg in association with motor or sensory disturbances. Chronic sciatica may cause personal morbidity and negatively impact an individual's quality of life (QOL). The prevalence of sciatica varies among studies, with incidences of 24–40% for different etiologies. The most common cause of sciatica is a herniated or bulging lumbar intervertebral disc. Other nondiscogenic causes that may contribute to sciatica include bony or muscular compression, vascular anomalies, and epidural adhesion. Owing to the diverse origins of sciatica, the most effective treatment for sciatica remains unknown. A recently published guideline (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence [NICE]) for treating low back pain with or without sciatica suggests administering noninvasive treatments such as physical therapy, yoga, tai chi, or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for first-line management of the condition. However, the NICE guidelines do not suggest patients with sciatica receive acupuncture treatment due to the relatively low-quality evidence from randomized controlled trials.

Acupuncture has been proposed as a treatment resulting in better outcomesfor many muscular and neurological diseases such as fibromyalgia, migraines, chronic pain syndrome, and acute stroke.–Acupuncture maneuvers may elicit a sensation of "de qi" (ie, dull pain, soreness or needling sensation) to achieve analgesia: neural signals are transferred through the peripheral nociceptive pathway, leading to a central neuromodulatory effect.

Nevertheless, there are several debates surrounding acupuncture treatment because there is inadequate evidence to promote its routine use. Some clinical trials and meta-analyses have recently contributed more evidence regarding acupuncture treatment for sciatica.–He et al, in their study of post-partum sciatica, revealed that up to 98% of patients in the treatment group recovered, compared with 24% in the non-acupuncture control group. Zhang et al showed electroacupuncture had greater short- and long-term benefits for chronic discogenic sciatica than medium-frequency electrotherapy. Qiu et al also demonstrated that acupuncture may stimulate the sciatic nerve trunk and effectively relieve pain in patients with discogenic sciatica. Moreover, acupuncture may reduce sciatica pain intensity, increase the pain threshold, enhance the effects of drug, and improve outcomes. The benefits of acupuncture in treating sciatica are well known; however, the possible dose-related response has not been sufficiently explored.

### Surgical versus non-surgical treatment for sciatica: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^117AHqac]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Other than radiographical evidence of disc herniation and corresponding signs or symptoms, the included studies varied in their method of identifying patients who would be considered for surgery. Differences were apparent in the requirement of unsuccessful non-surgical treatment, having incapacitating sciatica, or having persistent (> four months) sciatica. Seven (58.3%) of 12 trials did not specify how they identified patients. Thus, the study populations might vary across included trials. Also, participants were not typical patients with sciatica from the community because they were assessed for eligibility by surgeons.

Evidence update and meaning of the study

Compared with the most recent review, which only pooled data for disability within 24 months, our review provides results on leg pain, disability, back pain, and adverse events from the immediate term to five years after randomisation. Thus, unlike the equivocal benefits previously reported, we found that discectomy was initially beneficial but the effect declined over time, compared with either non-surgical care or epidural steroid injections. Generally, discectomy resulted in faster relief in pain and disability, but only up to 12 months. We also investigated the optimal timing of surgery for sciatica by conducting a subgroup analysis by symptom duration (less or greater than three months). Greater reductions in leg pain were reported in people with symptoms for less than three months at immediate and medium term, however, the differences were not significant. A post hoc exploratory subgroup analysis of unsuccessful non-surgical treatment suggests that trials without specifying the non-surgical treatment in the inclusion criteria reported higher effects in reducing leg pain (immediate term) and improving disability (short term) than did trials with unsuccessful non-surgical treatment.

We presented discectomy primarily because this surgical treatment is the most widely used for lumbar disc herniation. Nevertheless, the choice of surgical treatment by surgeon varies between countries. Thus, in our review, we presented results for a broader range of surgical procedures. Plasma disc decompression showed a moderate effect on leg pain and disability when compared with non-surgical treatment or epidural steroid injections. Similarly, chemonucleolysis with condoliase was shown to have moderate effects on leg pain and slight effects on disability.

### Therapeutic efficacy and the impact of the "Dose" effect of acupuncture to treat sciatica: a randomized controlled pilot study [^117MfqCu]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Results of this prospective, randomized, controlled, pilot study suggests that acupuncture is safe and effective for relieving symptoms and disability in patients with non-acute/chronic sciatica. MAL is as effective as MAH in treating chronic sciatica. MAH treatment seems superior to MAL treatment for sciatica patients with a higher stage of chronicity. However, more extensive case-control studies with larger sample sizes are needed to confirm with better certainty a dose–response relationship and the impact on chronicity.

### Traction for low-back pain with or without sciatica [^115mLj9M]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Various types of traction are used in the treatment of low-back pain (LBP), often in conjunction with other treatments.

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness of traction in the management of LBP.

Search Strategy

We searched The Cochrane Library 2004, Issue 4, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL to November 2004, references in relevant reviews, and our personal files.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) examining any type of traction for the treatment of acute (less than four weeks duration), sub-acute (four to 12 weeks) or chronic (more than 12 weeks) non-specific LBP with or without sciatica.

Data Collection and Analysis

Study selection, methodological quality assessment and data extraction were done independently by sets of two reviewers. As available studies did not provide sufficient data for statistical pooling, a qualitative analysis was performed.

Main Results

Twenty-four RCTs, involving 2177 patients (1016 receiving traction) were included in the review. Five trials were considered high quality. There is strong evidence that there is no significant difference in short or long-term outcomes between either continuous or intermittent traction and placebo, sham, or other treatments for patients with a mixed duration of LBP, with or without sciatica. There is moderate evidence that: autotraction is more effective other forms of traction are no more effective than placebo, sham or no treatment for patients with a mixed duration of LBP with sciatica. There is limited evidence that: there is no significant difference in outcomes between a standard physical therapy program with continuous traction and the same program without traction, for patients with a mixed duration of LBP, with or without sciatica autotraction on its own is more effective than a physical therapy program that includes Tru-Trac traction for patients with a mixed duration of LBP with sciatica. There is conflicting evidence regarding the short-term effectiveness of either continuous or intermittent traction compared to placebo, sham or other treatments, in the management of patients who have either chronic LBP or a mixed duration of LBP with sciatica.

Authors' Conclusions

The evidence suggests that traction is probably not effective. Neither continuous nor intermittent traction by itself was more effective in improving pain, disability or work absence than placebo, sham or other treatments for patients with a mixed duration of LBP, with or without sciatica. Although trials studying patients with sciatica had methodological limitations and inconsistent results, there was moderate evidence that autotraction was more effective than mechanical traction for global improvement in this population.

### The efficacy of systematic active conservative treatment for patients with severe sciatica: a single-blind, randomized, clinical, controlled trial [^112Vkh5t]. Spine (2012). Low credibility.

Study Design

Prospective single-blind, randomized, clinical, controlled trial.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy of active conservative treatment and to compare 2 active conservative treatment programs for patients with severe sciatica.

Summary Of Background Data

Reviews have demonstrated little or no efficacy for passive conservative treatment modalities in patients suffering from sciatica. The results for surgery are conflicting. Cohort studies have shown excellent results for active treatment modalities in patients with sciatica.

Methods

One hundred eighty-one consecutive patients with radicular pain below the knee were examined at the baseline, at 8 weeks, and at 1 year after the treatment. Participants were randomized into 2 groups: (1) symptom-guided exercises + information + advice to stay active and (2) sham exercises + information + advice to stay active. Symptom-guided exercises consisted of a variety of back-related exercises given in accordance with a written algorithm in which symptoms or response to exercises determined the exercises given (http://www.sygehuslillebaelt.dk/wm345075, click exercises). Sham exercises were optional, designed to increase general blood circulation, and had no targeted effect on the back. The information was comprehensive and included anatomy, pathogenesis, and how discs heal without surgery. The advice included encouragement to stay as active as possible but to reduce activity if leg pain increased. The use of medication was optional, but only paracetamol and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were recommended.

Results

A mean of 4.8 treatment sessions were provided. All patients experienced statistically significant and clinically important improvements in global assessment, functional status, pain, vocational status, and clinical findings. The symptom-guided exercise group improved significantly more than the sham exercise group in most outcomes.

Conclusion

Active conservative treatment was effective for patients who had symptoms and clinical findings that would normally qualify them for surgery. Although participating patients had greater faith in the sham exercises before treatment, the symptom-guided exercises were superior for most outcomes.

### Epidural corticosteroid injections for sciatica: an abridged cochrane systematic review and meta-analysis [^111AUGZQ]. Spine (2020). Medium credibility.

Study Design

Systematic with meta-analysis OBJECTIVES.: The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of epidural corticosteroid injections compared with placebo injection in reducing leg pain and disability in patients with sciatica.

Summary Of Background Data

Conservative treatments, including pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatments, are typically the first treatment options for sciatica but the evidence to support their use is limited. The overall quality of evidence found by previous systematic reviews varies between moderate and high, which suggests that future trials may change the conclusions. New placebo-controlled randomized trials have been published recently which highlights the importance of an updated systematic review.

Methods

The searches were performed without language restrictions in the following databases from 2012 to 25 September 2019: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, and trial registers. We included placebo-controlled randomized trials investigating epidural corticosteroid injections in patients with sciatica. The primary outcomes were leg pain intensity and disability. The secondary outcomes were adverse events, overall pain, and back pain intensity. We grouped similar trials according to outcome measures and their respective follow-up time points. Short-term follow-up (> 2 weeks but ≤ 3 months) was considered the primary follow-up time point due to the expected mechanism of action of epidural corticosteroid injection. Weighted mean differences (MDs) and risk ratios (RRs) with their respective 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated. We assessed the overall quality of evidence using the GRADE approach and conducted the analyses using random effects.

Results

We included 25 clinical trials (from 29 publications) providing data for a total of 2470 participants with sciatica, an increase of six trials when compared to the previous review. Epidural corticosteroid injections were probably more effective than placebo in reducing short-term leg pain (MD -4.93, 95% CI -8.77 to -1.09 on a 0–100 scale), short-term disability (MD -4.18, 95% CI: -6.04 to -2.17 on a 0–100 scale) and may be slightly more effective in reducing short-term overall pain (MD -9.35, 95% CI -14.05 to -4.65 on a 0–100 scale). There were mostly minor adverse events (i.e., without hospitalization) after epidural corticosteroid injections and placebo injections without difference between groups (RR 1.14, 95% CI: 0.91–1.42). The quality of evidence was at best moderate mostly due to problems with trial design and inconsistency.

Conclusion

A review of 25 placebo-controlled trials provides moderate-quality evidence that epidural corticosteroid injections are effective, although the effects are small and short-term. There is uncertainty on safety due to very low-quality evidence.

### Cascade of decisions meet personal preferences in sciatica treatment decisions [^117YC1dX]. BMJ Open Quality (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Sciatica can be managed both conservatively and surgically. In the Netherlands, sciatica care is organised following the stepped care principle, involving a general practitioner (GP) as gatekeeper for hospital care, and a hospital-based neurologist, before a neurosurgeon is consulted. Therefore, a chain of decisions and referrals precede surgery. Both the diagnostic process and timing of surgical treatment and the (societal) value of surgery over conservative treatment are topics of ongoing discussion, and practice variation has been widely reported. This practice variation may be driven by both differences between and within patient and provider preferences. This makes the management of sciatica of interest. Which preferences of patients and physician(s) shape these decisions?

In the Netherlands, the GP is the point of entry for non-acute health complaints. For sciatica, the GP guideline advises conservative treatment for 6–8 weeks, combining a strategy of watchful waiting, informing the patient and providing painkillers. If the patients' complaints last longer, the GP can refer to a neurologist. Neurologists can confirm the diagnosis and might order imaging. However, the neurologists' guideline advises against imaging, unless surgery is considered or there is doubt about underlying cause or pathology. Recent research showed that only 11% of Dutch neurologists routinely order imaging. Apart from conservative options, the neurologist can also prescribe more invasive pain treatments, usually performed by a pain team. In case of persisting complaints, the patient might be referred to a neurosurgeon or orthopaedic surgeon to consider surgery. The Dutch neurosurgery guideline advices not to perform surgery on patients with less than 8 weeks of complaints, and proposes surgery after more than 6 months of complaints without any proper improvement. In the intermediary period natural recovery could occur. Therefore, a shared decision on treatment should be pursued with the patient. A multidisciplinary guideline exists, of which the implementation faces difficulties.

### Lumbar disc herniations: surgical versus nonsurgical treatment [^113R4Ftw]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2006). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Lumbar disc herniation is among the most common causes of lower-back pain and sciatica. The cause(s) of lumbar disc herniation and the relation of lumbar disc herniation to back pain and sciatica have not been fully elucidated, but most likely comprise a complex combination of mechanical and biologic processes. Furthermore, the natural history of lumbar disc herniation seems generally to be favorable, leaving the optimum treatment for lumbar disc herniation a debate in the literature. Various nonoperative and operative treatment strategies have been tried with varying degrees of success. Treatment often involves patient education, physical therapy, alternative medicine options, and pharmaco-therapy. If these fail, surgical intervention is usually recommended. A literature search was conducted to evaluate the currently known effectiveness of traditional and novel non-operative and surgical techniques for the treatment lumbar disc herniation and to determine if there are substantive new advantages in these newer contemporary treatments or combinations thereof. A structured approach to treatment of a patient who may have a symptomatic lumbar disc herniation is presented, based on analysis of the current literature. No one method of nonoperative or operative treatment would seem definitively to be superior to another. Appropriate multidisciplinary treatment including behavioral analysis and support may offer the hope of improved outcomes for patients with lumbar disc herniation.

### Surgery versus conservative management of sciatica due to a lumbar herniated disc: a systematic review [^114VnjGL]. European Spine Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In general, there is evidence that early surgery in patients with sciatica provides for a better short-term relief of leg pain as compared to prolonged conservative care, but the evidence is low quality because of the fact that only one trial investigated this properly. No significant differences were found between surgery and usual conservative care in any of the clinical outcomes after 1 and 2 years, but the evidence is of very low quality. The scarcity of studies as well as the limited quality of the studies does not support the choice for any timing in our current guidelines.

Future studies should evaluate who benefits more from surgery and who from conservative care. Also economic evaluations should analyse the economical gain of the potential faster recovery against increased cost and complication rate of surgery.

### Invasive treatments for low back disorders [^113dV893]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2021). High credibility.

ACOEM Guidelines — scope and clinical questions for invasive treatments target management of low back disorders among working-age adults and span acute (up to 1 month duration), subacute (1 to 3 months' duration), and chronic (more than 3 months' duration) clinical timeframes; covered conditions include low back pain (LBP), sciatica/radiculopathy, spondylolisthesis, facet arthrosis, degeneration of the disc, failed back surgery syndrome, and spinal stenosis, while several broad categories including congenital disorders or malignancies and specific intraoperative procedures are not addressed. Guidance is organized by treatment phase (acute, subacute, chronic, postoperative) to answer multi-part questions including when, and for what conditions invasive procedures are recommended, when, and for what conditions surgery are recommended, which surgeries are recommended for which conditions, and what management options are recommended for delayed recovery.

### Timing of surgery for sciatica: subgroup analysis alongside a randomized trial [^1172ZxJJ]. European Spine Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Introduction

Sciatica is characterized by radiating pain in an area of the leg typically served by one lumbar or sacral spinal nerve root and is sometimes associated with sensory and motor deficit. Apart from infrequent causes, sciatica is mostly due to a herniated lumbar disc. Because of the high prevalence in general practice and the major impact of low back disorders on society, surgery is frequently performed to speed up recovery of sciatica. Probably as a result of socio-cultural circumstances, different timing of surgical removal of the herniated portion of the disc appears to vary greatly in the western countries. Recently the option of surgery was offered to patients after only 6 weeks of unremitting sciatica. The major reason to offer early surgery was the unattractive alternative: the slow natural course of sciatica, occasionally extending over 4 years. Globally two options were available: (1) early surgery and (2) prolonged conservative care, possibly with surgery at a later date. Since surgery is economically affordable and relatively safe, most patients in western countries prefer early surgery rather than to wait for months or even years, risking long term work-disability and presence of chronic pain. Recently this study provided evidence that the prolonged conservative care strategy resulted in complete recovery at 1 year as similar as the surgical strategy, but it took twice as long compared to early surgery. The 1-year effects of the two assigned treatment strategies were similar as far as function and pain were concerned in the randomized cohorts. The contribution of this study is that patients, opting for early surgery, now are able to base their decision on realistic data about the alternative strategy, with similar outcomes at 1 and 2 years compared to early surgery. Individual decisions regarding early surgery or not are still difficult to make. Since treatment effects can differ between subgroups of patients, this might influence the indication for early disc surgery.

Therefore, it would be of great interest to patients and physicians to define determinants which occur early in the course of sciatica and predict the speed of recovery with either prolonged conservative care or early surgery. Insight in these determinants may help in the decision about when to perform surgery. We carried out a subgroup analysis of data from the aforementioned randomized trial to evaluate anamnestic, neurological and radiological variables which might in theory influence the difference in rate of recovery between the two treatment strategies.

### Emergency department interventions for adult patients with low back pain: a systematic review of randomised controlled trials [^1172aFKD]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Most low back pain trials have limited applicability to the emergency department (ED) because they provide treatment and measure outcomes after discharge from the ED. We investigated the efficacy and safety of pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions delivered in the ED to patients with non-specific low back pain and/or sciatica on patient-relevant outcomes measured during the emergency visit.

Methods

Literature searches were performed in MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL from inception to week 1 February 2020. We included all randomised controlled trials investigating adult patients (≥ 18 years) with non-specific low back pain and/or sciatica presenting to ED. The primary outcome of interest was pain intensity. Two reviewers independently screened the full texts, extracted the data and assessed risk of bias of each trial using the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) scale. The overall quality of evidence, or certainty, provided by a set of trials evaluating the same treatment was evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach, which considers imprecision, inconsistency, indirectness and bias in the evidence.

Results

Fifteen trials (1802 participants) were included with 12 of 15 at low risk of bias (ie, PEDro score > 6). Based on results from individual trials and moderate quality evidence, ketoprofen gel was more effective than placebo for non-specific low back pain at 30min (mean difference (MD) -15.0, 95% confidence interval (CI) -21.0 to -9.0). For those with sciatica (moderate quality evidence), intravenous paracetamol (acetaminophen) (MD -15.7, 95%CI -19.8 to -11.6) and intravenous morphine (MD -11.4, 95%CI -21.6 to -1.2) were both superior to placebo at 30min. Based on moderate quality of evidence, corticosteroids showed no benefits against placebo at emergency discharge for non-specific low back pain (MD 9.0, 95%CI -0.71 to 18.7) or sciatica (MD -6.8, 95%CI -24.2 to 10.6). There were conflicting results from trials comparing different pharmacological options (moderate quality evidence) or investigating non-pharmacological treatments (low quality evidence).

Conclusion

Ketoprofen gel for non-specific low back pain and intravenous paracetamol or morphine for sciatica were superior to placebo, whereas corticosteroids were ineffective for both conditions. There was conflicting evidence for comparisons of different pharmacological options and those involving non-pharmacological treatments. Additional trials measuring important patient-related outcomes to EDs are needed.

### Trial of pregabalin for acute and chronic sciatica [^113vfXFD]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2017). Excellent credibility.

Background

Sciatica can be disabling, and evidence regarding medical treatments is limited. Pregabalin is effective in the treatment of some types of neuropathic pain. This study examined whether pregabalin may reduce the intensity of sciatica.

Methods

We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of pregabalin in patients with sciatica. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either pregabalin at a dose of 150 mg per day that was adjusted to a maximum dose of 600 mg per day or matching placebo for up to 8 weeks. The primary outcome was the leg-pain intensity score on a 10-point scale (with 0 indicating no pain and 10 the worst possible pain) at week 8; the leg-pain intensity score was also evaluated at week 52, a secondary time point for the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes included the extent of disability, back-pain intensity, and quality-of-life measures at prespecified time points over the course of 1 year.

Results

A total of 209 patients underwent randomization, of whom 108 received pregabalin and 101 received placebo; after randomization, 2 patients in the pregabalin group were determined to be ineligible and were excluded from the analyses. At week 8, the mean unadjusted leg-pain intensity score was 3.7 in the pregabalin group and 3.1 in the placebo group (adjusted mean difference, 0.5; 95% confidence interval, -0.2 to 1.2; P = 0.19). At week 52, the mean unadjusted leg-pain intensity score was 3.4 in the pregabalin group and 3.0 in the placebo group (adjusted mean difference, 0.3; 95% CI, -0.5 to 1.0; P = 0.46). No significant between-group differences were observed with respect to any secondary outcome at either week 8 or week 52. A total of 227 adverse events were reported in the pregabalin group and 124 in the placebo group. Dizziness was more common in the pregabalin group than in the placebo group.

Conclusions

Treatment with pregabalin did not significantly reduce the intensity of leg pain associated with sciatica and did not significantly improve other outcomes, as compared with placebo, over the course of 8 weeks. The incidence of adverse events was significantly higher in the pregabalin group than in the placebo group.

### Surgery versus prolonged conservative treatment for sciatica [^114fxZpX]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2007). Excellent credibility.

Background

Lumbar-disk surgery often is performed in patients who have sciatica that does not resolve within 6 weeks, but the optimal timing of surgery is not known.

Methods

We randomly assigned 283 patients who had had severe sciatica for 6 to 12 weeks to early surgery or to prolonged conservative treatment with surgery if needed. The primary outcomes were the score on the Roland Disability Questionnaire, the score on the visual-analogue scale for leg pain, and the patient's report of perceived recovery during the first year after randomization. Repeated-measures analysis according to the intention-to-treat principle was used to estimate the outcome curves for both groups.

Results

Of 141 patients assigned to undergo early surgery, 125 (89%) underwent microdiskectomy after a mean of 2.2 weeks. Of 142 patients designated for conservative treatment, 55 (39%) were treated surgically after a mean of 18.7 weeks. There was no significant overall difference in disability scores during the first year (P = 0.13). Relief of leg pain was faster for patients assigned to early surgery (P < 0.001). Patients assigned to early surgery also reported a faster rate of perceived recovery (hazard ratio, 1.97; 95% confidence interval, 1.72 to 2.22; P < 0.001). In both groups, however, the probability of perceived recovery after 1 year of follow-up was 95%.

Conclusions

The 1-year outcomes were similar for patients assigned to early surgery and those assigned to conservative treatment with eventual surgery if needed, but the rates of pain relief and of perceived recovery were faster for those assigned to early surgery.

### The management of sciatica by acupuncture: an expert consensus using the improved Delphi survey [^114Ask8U]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Sciatica is usually unilateral radiation pain along the direction of the sciatic nerve, accounting for 13% to 40% in different studies and reviews. Lumbosacral nerve root (L4-S1) inflammation or compression is the main cause. Neuroradiology studies have confirmed that 85% of sciatica is related to disc disease. Most patients report low back pain at the same time as pain. The severity of pain varies from patient to patient along with a sudden or chronic onset mostly. It can extend from below the knee to the toes of the feet. In severe cases, symptoms such as low back pain, decreased muscle strength, and abnormal reflexes may occur, which would cause severe discomfort with limited quality of life and function.

The current focus of treatment is to prevent the disease from becoming chronic through conventional drug treatment and early conservative treatment. However, conventional drugs have a variety of potential adverse events, particularly gastrointestinal and cardiovascular effects. Recently updated clinical guidelines emphasize the role of conservative treatment of sciatica from Denmark, and the US. Surgery which can early relieve pain maybe is an option if the symptoms do not improve after 6–8 weeks of early intervention, but its effect is similar to that of conservative treatment within one year.

Acupuncture is a non-pharmacological therapy used in pain control. At present, acupuncture is widely used in the treatment of sciatica, but the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines recommend that acupuncture should not be provided as a non-invasive treatment for patients with sciatica, which is based on the following: i) Relative values of different outcomes; ii) Trade-off between clinical benefits and harms; iii) Trade-off between net clinical effects and costs; iv) Quality of evidence; and v) Other considerations. In terms of the standardized use of acupuncture, there is no internationally recognized evidence and guidance recommendations except for the "Evidence-Based Acupuncture Clinical Practice Guide: Sciatica" from China. However, with the continuous emergence of new research evidence (ie, changes in available interventions, clinical efficacy, or cost), it is necessary to conduct expert consensus based on existing evidence and update appropriately to maintain the trustworthiness of clinical guidelines.

These uncertainties of acupuncture treatment recommendations for sciatica prompted this study to establish an expert consensus based on the clinical investigation and literature review by using the improved Delphi method, which is conducive to unifying the acupuncture principles and putting forward a standard therapeutic protocol for the treatment of sciatica which could be used in future trials and clinical practice.

### Low back and radicular pain: a pathway for care developed by the British pain society [^112dHsJD]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2013). Low credibility.

These consensus guidelines aim to provide an overview of best practice for managing chronic spinal pain reflecting the heterogeneity of low back pain. Most guidelines have covered only one aspect of spinal care and thus have been divisive and potentially worsened the quality of care. Additionally, some of the evidence base is subjective and of poor quality. The British Pain Society low back pain pathway has reached across all disciplines and involved input from patients. It is recognized, however, that there is an urgent need for further good-quality clinical research in this area to underpin future guidelines. Considerable work is still needed to clarify the evidence; however, foundations have been laid with this pathway. Key features include: risk stratification; clarification of intensity of psychological interventions; a logical progression for the management of sciatica; and decision points for considering structural interventions such as spinal injections and surgery.

### Outcome of invasive treatment modalities on back pain and sciatica: an evidence-based review [^114HNsk8]. European Spine Journal (2006). Low credibility.

Within the framework of evidence-based medicine high-quality randomised trials and systematic reviews are considered a necessary prerequisite for progress in orthopaedics. This paper summarises the currently available evidence on surgical and other invasive procedures for low back pain. Results of systematic reviews conducted within the framework of the Cochrane Back Review Group were used. Data were gathered from the latest Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 2005, Issue 2. The Cochrane reviews were updated using the evidence summary on surgery and other invasive procedures from the COST B13 European Guidelines for the Management of Acute and Chronic Non-Specific Low Back Pain. Facet joint, epidural, trigger point and sclerosant injections have not clearly been shown to be effective and can consequently not be recommended. There is no scientific evidence on the effectiveness of spinal stenosis surgery. Surgical discectomy may be considered for selected patients with sciatica due to lumbar disc prolapses that fail to resolve with the conservative management. Cognitive intervention Combined with exercises is recommended for chronic low back pain, and fusion surgery may be considered only in carefully selected patients after active rehabilitation programmes during 2 years time have failed. Demanding surgical fusion techniques are not better than the traditional posterolateral fusion without internal fixation.

### A comparison of the efficacy and tolerability of the treatments for sciatica: a network meta-analysis [^113QLRHj]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2017). Low credibility.

Background

There remains a lack of a systematic summary of the efficacy and safety of various medicines for sciatica, and discrepancies among these exist.

Objective

The aim of this study is to comprehensively assess the efficacy of and tolerance to several medical options for the treatment of sciatica.

Methods

We performed a network meta-analysis and illustrated the results by the mean difference or odds ratio. The surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) was used for indicating the preferable treatments. All data analyses and graphs were achieved via R 3.3.2 and Stata 13.0.

Results

The subcutaneous anti-tumor necrosis factor-α (anti-TNF-α) was superior to the epidural steroid + anesthetic in reducing lumbar pain in both acute + chronic sciatica patients and acute sciatica patients. The epidural steroid demonstrated a better ability regarding the Oswestry disability score (ODI) compared to the subcutaneous anti-TNF-α. In addition, for total pain relief, the use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs was inferior to the epidural steroid + anesthetic. The epidural anesthetic and epidural steroid + anesthetic both demonstrated superiority over the epidural steroid and intramuscular steroid. The intravenous anti-TNF-α ranked first in leg pain relief, while the subcutaneous anti-TNF-α ranked first in lumbar pain relief, and the epidural steroid ranked first in the ODI on the basis of SUCRA. In addition, their safety outcome (withdrawal) rankings were all medium to high.

Conclusions

Intravenous and subcutaneous anti-TNF-α were identified as the optimal treatments for both acute + chronic sciatica patients and acute sciatica patients. In addition, the epidural steroid was also recommended as a good intervention due to its superiority in reducing ODI.

### Lumbosacral radiculopathies: conservative approaches to management [^117BhHy9]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

The prevalence of sciatica in Western society and its economic and functional impact make it an important problem to understand for treatment. Such understanding will impact greatly both medical management and decisions regarding activity, which could affect the perceived disability and financial dependence of a patient. This knowledge could be used to direct primary prevention, patient education, and future research efforts in back pain. The article also discusses that such strategies could improve health, decrease disability, and rein in costs.

### Surgery versus conservative management of sciatica due to a lumbar herniated disc: a systematic review [^111XpT6F]. European Spine Journal (2011). Low credibility.

The effectiveness of surgery in patients with sciatica due to lumbar disc herniations is not without dispute. The goal of this study was to assess the effects of surgery versus conservative therapy (including epidural injections) for patients with sciatica due to lumbar disc herniation. A comprehensive search was conducted in MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, CENTRAL, and PEDro up to October 2009. Randomised controlled trials of adults with lumbar radicular pain, which evaluated at least one clinically relevant outcome measure (pain, functional status, perceived recovery, lost days of work) were included. Two authors assessed risk of bias according to Cochrane criteria and extracted the data. In total, five studies were identified, two of which with a low risk of bias. One study compared early surgery with prolonged conservative care followed by surgery if needed; three studies compared surgery with usual conservative care, and one study compared surgery with epidural injections. Data were not pooled because of clinical heterogeneity and poor reporting of data. One large low-risk-of-bias trial demonstrated that early surgery in patients with 6–12 weeks of radicular pain leads to faster pain relief when compared with prolonged conservative treatment, but there were no differences after 1 and 2 years. Another large low-risk-of-bias trial between surgery and usual conservative care found no statistically significant differences on any of the primary outcome measures after 1 and 2 years. Future studies should evaluate who benefits more from surgery and who from conservative care.

### Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for acute low back pain [^111o4mKT]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute low back pain (LBP) is a common health problem. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are often used in the treatment of LBP, particularly in people with acute LBP. In 2008, a Cochrane Review was published about the efficacy of NSAIDs for LBP (acute, chronic, and sciatica), identifying a small but significant effect in favour of NSAIDs compared to placebo for short-term pain reduction and global improvement in participants with acute LBP. This is an update of the previous review, focusing on acute LBP.

Objectives

To assess the effects of NSAIDs compared to placebo and other comparison treatments for acute LBP.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PubMed, and two trials registers for randomised controlled trials (RCT) to 7 January 2020. We also screened the reference lists from relevant reviews and included studies.

Selection Criteria

We included RCTs that assessed the use of one or more types of NSAIDs compared to placebo (the main comparison) or alternative treatments for acute LBP in adults (≥ 18 years); conducted in both primary and secondary care settings. We assessed the effects of treatment on pain reduction, disability, global improvement, adverse events, and return to work.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected trials to be included in this review, evaluated the risk of bias, and extracted the data. If appropriate, we performed a meta-analysis, using a random-effects model throughout, due to expected variability between studies. We assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach. We used standard methodological procedures recommended by Cochrane.

Main Results

We included 32 trials, with a total of 5356 participants (age range 16 to 78 years). Follow-up ranged from one day to six months. Studies were conducted across the globe, the majority taking place in Europe and North-America. Africa and the Eastern Mediterranean region were not represented. We considered seven studies at low risk of bias. Performance and attrition were the most common biases. There was often a lack of information on randomisation procedures and allocation concealment (selection bias); studies were prone to selective reporting bias, since most studies did not register their trials. Almost half of the studies were industry-funded. There is moderate quality evidence that NSAIDs are slightly more effective in short-term (≤ 3 weeks) reduction of pain intensity (visual analogue scale (VAS), 0 to 100) than placebo (mean difference (MD) -7.29 (95% confidence interval (CI) -10.98 to -3.61; 4 RCTs, N = 815). There is high quality evidence that NSAIDs are slightly more effective for short-term improvement in disability (Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ), 0 to 24) than placebo (MD -2.02, 95% CI -2.89 to -1.15; 2 RCTs, N = 471). The magnitude of these effects is small and probably not clinically relevant. There is low quality evidence that NSAIDs are slightly more effective for short-term global improvement than placebo (risk ratio (RR) 1.40, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.75; 5 RCTs, N = 1201), but there was substantial heterogeneity (I² 52%) between studies. There is very low quality evidence of no clear difference in the proportion of participants experiencing adverse events when using NSAIDs compared to placebo (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.18; 6 RCTs, N = 1394). There is very low quality evidence of no clear difference between the proportion of participants who could return to work after seven days between those who used NSAIDs and those who used placebo (RR 1.48, 95% CI 0.98 to 2.23; 1 RCT, N = 266). There is low quality evidence of no clear difference in short-term reduction of pain intensity between those who took selective COX-2 inhibitor NSAIDs compared to non-selective NSAIDs (mean change from baseline -2.60, 95% CI -9.23 to 4.03; 2 RCTs, N = 437). There is moderate quality evidence of conflicting results for short-term disability improvement between groups (2 RCTs, N = 437). Low quality evidence from one trial (N = 333) reported no clear difference between groups in the proportion of participants experiencing global improvement. There is very low quality evidence of no clear difference in the proportion of participants experiencing adverse events between those who took COX-2 inhibitors and non-selective NSAIDs (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.50; 2 RCTs, N = 444). No data were reported for return to work.

Authors' Conclusions

This updated Cochrane Review included 32 trials to evaluate the efficacy of NSAIDs in people with acute LBP. The quality of the evidence ranged from high to very low, thus further research is (very) likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimates of effect, and may change the estimates. NSAIDs seemed slightly more effective than placebo for short-term pain reduction (moderate certainty), disability (high certainty), and global improvement (low certainty), but the magnitude of the effects is small and probably not clinically relevant. There was no clear difference in short-term pain reduction (low certainty) when comparing selective COX-2 inhibitors to non-selective NSAIDs. We found very low evidence of no clear difference in the proportion of participants experiencing adverse events in both the comparison of NSAIDs versus placebo and selective COX-2 inhibitors versus non-selective NSAIDs. We were unable to draw conclusions about adverse events and the safety of NSAIDs for longer-term use, since we only included RCTs with a primary focus on short-term use of NSAIDs and a short follow-up. These are not optimal for answering questions about longer-term or rare adverse events.

### Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for low back pain [^1176aFTJ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are the most frequently prescribed medications worldwide and are widely used for patients with low-back pain. Selective COX-2 inhibitors are currently available and used for patients with low-back pain.

Objectives

The objective was to assess the effects of NSAIDs and COX-2 inhibitors in the treatment of non-specific low-back pain and to assess which type of NSAID is most effective.

Search Strategy

We searched the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials up to and including June 2007 if reported in English, Dutch or German. We also screened references given in relevant reviews and identified trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomised trials and double-blind controlled trials of NSAIDs in non-specific low-back pain with or without sciatica were included.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed methodological quality. All studies were also assessed on clinical relevance, from which no further interpretations or conclusions were drawn. If data were considered clinically homogeneous, a meta-analysis was performed. If data were lacking for clinically homogeneous trials, a qualitative analysis was performed using a rating system with four levels of evidence (strong, moderate, limited, no evidence).

Main Results

In total, 65 trials (total number of patients = 11,237) were included in this review. Twenty-eight trials (42%) were considered high quality. Statistically significant effects were found in favour of NSAIDs compared to placebo, but at the cost of statistically significant more side effects. There is moderate evidence that NSAIDs are not more effective than paracetamol for acute low-back pain, but paracetamol had fewer side effects. There is moderate evidence that NSAIDs are not more effective than other drugs for acute low-back pain. There is strong evidence that various types of NSAIDs, including COX-2 NSAIDs, are equally effective for acute low-back pain. COX-2 NSAIDs had statistically significantly fewer side-effects than traditional NSAIDs.

Authors' Conclusions

The evidence from the 65 trials included in this review suggests that NSAIDs are effective for short-term symptomatic relief in patients with acute and chronic low-back pain without sciatica. However, effect sizes are small. Furthermore, there does not seem to be a specific type of NSAID which is clearly more effective than others. The selective COX-2 inhibitors showed fewer side effects compared to traditional NSAIDs in the RCTs included in this review. However, recent studies have shown that COX-2 inhibitors are associated with increased cardiovascular risks in specific patient populations.

### Efficacy and safety of antidepressants for the treatment of back pain and osteoarthritis: systematic review and meta-analysis [^112V8prL]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Evidence update

Our review updates the evidence for back pain, sciatica, and osteoarthritis. For example, we included 25 trials (n = 2955 participants) for back pain and sciatica, whereas the most recent review included 16 trials. Our findings are in accordance with those from a previous review of drug treatments for chronic low back pain, which found TCAs and SSRIs to be ineffective and SNRIs to be effective, although the effects were small. Our safety analyses showed that SNRIs statistically significantly increased the risk of any adverse event. The increased risk of adverse events with SNRIs had already been described in a review of osteoarthritisand chronic painbut not chronic low back pain.

For this review we pooled data for TCAs and SNRIs for sciatica. Across pain and disability outcomes, TCAs were effective in three of six estimates, whereas SNRIs were effective in one of four estimates. In instances when these drugs were more effective than placebo, the effects exceeded our prespecified threshold for clinical importance. However, these estimates were based on less certain evidence. The low to very low certainty of evidence described in our review contrasts with a recent review of drug treatment for neuropathic pain in adults, which recommends TCAs and SNRIs as preferred treatment for people with neuropathic pain based on strong evidence.

Our review also updates the evidence for osteoarthritis. We pooled data from eight osteoarthritis trials whereas a previous review only pooled five trials. We also explored the effect of dose on treatment effect estimates for back pain and osteoarthritis. We showed that the effects of duloxetine (an SNRI) were similar regardless of whether the dose used in the trials was 20, 60, or 120 mg/day.

### Efficacy of electroacupuncture combined with Chinese herbal medicine on pain intensity for chronic sciatica secondary to lumbar disc herniation: study protocol for a randomised controlled trial [^1136rP2m]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Sciatica is characterized by radiating leg pain extending from the buttock down the course of the sciatic nerve and accompanied by back pain and neurological deficits sometimes. Symptoms of sciatic pain are common with the highest incidence of 40%, and the pain can easily progress to a chronic and recurrent stage, as sciatica can be caused by interference anywhere in the sciatic nerve. Of all patients with sciatica, 85% of cases are associated with a disc disorder. The prevalence of sciatica varies between 1.6% and 43%, with a significantly higher incidence in developing countries. Thus, sciatica is thought to be a major health issue worldwide. In addition to severe disability and work absenteeism, it has a significant impact on medical costs. Surgical treatment has short-term benefits for patients with acute sciatica, but the long-term benefits are not obvious. Besides its high cost is often prohibitive. Conservative treatments (eg, exercise and spinal manipulation) are more acceptable for cost-efficiency and their few adverse reactions. However, the efficacy of them is controversial. Based on the above analysis, safe, economical, and effective treatments are an unmet clinical need for patients with chronic sciatica.

### Traction for low-back pain with or without sciatica [^112aAyAt]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Traction has been used to treat low-back pain (LBP), often in combination with other treatments. We included both manual and machine-delivered traction in this review. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 1995, and previously updated in 2006.

Objectives

To assess the effects of traction compared to placebo, sham traction, reference treatments and no treatment in people with LBP.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Back Review Group Specialized Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (2012, Issue 8), MEDLINE (January 2006 to August 2012), EMBASE (January 2006 to August 2012), CINAHL (January 2006 to August 2012), and reference lists of articles and personal files. The review authors are not aware of any important new randomized controlled trial (RCTs) on this topic since the date of the last search.

Selection Criteria

RCTs involving traction to treat acute (less than four weeks' duration), subacute (four to 12 weeks' duration) or chronic (more than 12 weeks' duration) non-specific LBP with or without sciatica.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently performed study selection, risk of bias assessment and data extraction. As there were insufficient data for statistical pooling, we performed a descriptive analysis. We did not find any case series that identified adverse effects, therefore we evaluated adverse effects that were reported in the included studies.

Main Results

We included 32 RCTs involving 2762 participants in this review. We considered 16 trials, representing 57% of all participants, to have a low risk of bias based on the Cochrane Back Review Group's 'Risk of bias' tool. For people with mixed symptom patterns (acute, subacute and chronic LBP with and without sciatica), there was low- to moderate-quality evidence that traction may make little or no difference in pain intensity, functional status, global improvement or return to work when compared to placebo, sham traction or no treatment. Similarly, when comparing the combination of physiotherapy plus traction with physiotherapy alone or when comparing traction with other treatments, there was very-low- to moderate-quality evidence that traction may make little or no difference in pain intensity, functional status or global improvement. For people with LBP with sciatica and acute, subacute or chronic pain, there was low- to moderate-quality evidence that traction probably has no impact on pain intensity, functional status or global improvement. This was true when traction was compared with controls and other treatments, as well as when the combination of traction plus physiotherapy was compared with physiotherapy alone. No studies reported the effect of traction on return to work. For chronic LBP without sciatica, there was moderate-quality evidence that traction probably makes little or no difference in pain intensity when compared with sham treatment. No studies reported on the effect of traction on functional status, global improvement or return to work. Adverse effects were reported in seven of the 32 studies. These included increased pain, aggravation of neurological signs and subsequent surgery. Four studies reported that there were no adverse effects. The remaining studies did not mention adverse effects.

Authors' Conclusions

These findings indicate that traction, either alone or in combination with other treatments, has little or no impact on pain intensity, functional status, global improvement and return to work among people with LBP. There is only limited-quality evidence from studies with small sample sizes and moderate to high risk of bias. The effects shown by these studies are small and are not clinically relevant. Implications for practice To date, the use of traction as treatment for non-specific LBP cannot be motivated by the best available evidence. These conclusions are applicable to both manual and mechanical traction. Implications for research Only new, large, high-quality studies may change the point estimate and its accuracy, but it should be noted that such change may not necessarily favour traction. Therefore, little priority should be given to new studies on the effect of traction treatment alone or as part of a package.

### Stratified care versus usual care for management of patients presenting with sciatica in primary care (SCOPiC): a randomised controlled trial [^11268uGp]. The Lancet: Rheumatology (2020). High credibility.

Background

Sciatica has a substantial impact on individuals and society. Stratified care has been shown to lead to better outcomes among patients with non-specific low back pain, but it has not been tested for sciatica. We aimed to investigate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of stratified care versus non-stratified usual care for patients presenting with sciatica in primary care.

Methods

We did a two-parallel arm, pragmatic, randomised controlled trial across three centres in the UK (North Staffordshire, North Shropshire/Wales, and Cheshire). Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older, had a clinical diagnosis of sciatica, access to a mobile phone or landline number, were not pregnant, were not currently receiving treatment for the same problem, and had no previous spinal surgery. Patients were recruited from general practices and randomly assigned (1:1) by a remote web-based service to stratified care or usual care, stratified by centre and stratification group allocation. In the stratified care arm, a combination of prognostic and clinical criteria associated with referral to spinal specialist services were used to allocate patients to one of three groups for matched care pathways. Group 1 was offered brief advice and support in up to two physiotherapy sessions; group 2 was offered up to six physiotherapy sessions; and group 3 was fast-tracked to MRI and spinal specialist assessment within 4 weeks of randomisation. The primary outcome was self-reported time to first resolution of sciatica symptoms, defined as "completely recovered" or "much better" on a 6-point ordinal scale, collected via text messages or telephone calls. Analyses were by intention to treat. Health-care costs and cost-effectiveness were also assessed. This trial is registered on the ISRCTN registry, ISRCTN75449581.

Findings

Between May 28, 2015, and July 18, 2017, 476 patients from 42 general practices around three UK centres were randomly assigned to stratified care or usual care (238 in each arm). For the primary outcome, the overall response rate was 89% (9467 of 10601 text messages sent; 4688 [88%] of 5310 in the stratified care arm and 4779 [90%] of 5291 in the usual care arm). Median time to symptom resolution was 10 weeks (95% CI 6·4–13·6) in the stratified care arm and 12 weeks (9·4–14·6) in the usual care arm, with the survival analysis showing no significant difference between the arms (hazard ratio 1·14 [95% CI 0·89–1·46]). Stratified care was not cost-effective compared to usual care.

Interpretation

The stratified care model for patients with sciatica consulting in primary care was not better than usual care for either clinical or health economic outcomes. These results do not support a transition to this stratified care model for patients with sciatica.

### Therapeutic efficacy and the impact of the "Dose" effect of acupuncture to treat sciatica: a randomized controlled pilot study [^114hKtWj]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The present study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of acupuncture therapy on chronic sciatica, the dose effect of acupuncture, and the influence of pain chronicity on acupuncture treatment outcome. First, we observed whether acupuncture was effective in patients with sciatica who received MAL or MAH. Second, we found that the efficacy of acupuncture treatment on sciatica was not lesser in the MAL group than in the MAH group. Third, the analysis of sciatica pain chronicity revealed that patients who had sciatica for more than 12 months had inferior scores for pain or disability than patients who had sciatica for less than 1 year. Fourth, we demonstrated that acupuncture may ameliorate differences between groups with different levels of pain chronicity, and we further specified that MAH may enhance physical activity in patients with a relatively longer pain duration.

The results of this study indicated that, in patients with chronic sciatica, acupuncture therapy was effective for pain relief, reduced disability, and alleviated annoyance due to sciatica. Our results are in line with those of recent clinical trials and meta-analyses. In our previous review of common acupoints for treating sciatica, the acupoints selected were primarily in the bladder (BL) and gallbladder (GB) meridians, as well as the Governing Vessels and Kidney (KI) meridians, which, based on TCM theory, may nourish the patient's qi. Our acupoint selection for treating sciatica was based on TCM theory and took into account a concept in contemporary medicine: the dermatome. Sciatica primarily involves the L4 and L5 to S1 dermatomes. The BL and GB meridians are mostly distributed in the L4, L5, and S1 dermatomes, and the KI, stomach (ST) and spleen (SP) meridians are generally distributed in the L4 and S1 dermatomes. Recent research reveals that acupuncture stimulation in the sciatic nerve trunk is more effective in relieving pain compared with simple routine acupuncture. Our strategy for choosing acupoints seems to reflect the efficacy of acupuncture treatment for sciatica.

### Effectiveness of conservative treatments for the lumbosacral radicular syndrome: a systematic review [^115Envnu]. European Spine Journal (2007). Low credibility.

Patients with a lumbosacral radicular syndrome are mostly treated conservatively first. The effect of the conservative treatments remains controversial. To assess the effectiveness of conservative treatments of the lumbosacral radicular syndrome (sciatica). Relevant electronic databases and the reference lists of articles up to May 2004 were searched. Randomised clinical trials of all types of conservative treatments for patients with the lumbosacral radicular syndrome selected by two reviewers. Two reviewers independently assessed the methodological quality and the clinical relevance. Because the trials were considered heterogeneous we decided not to perform a meta-analysis but to summarise the results using the rating system of levels of evidence. Thirty trials were included that evaluated injections, traction, physical therapy, bed rest, manipulation, medication, and acupuncture as treatment for the lumbosacral radicular syndrome. Because several trials indicated no evidence of an effect it is not recommended to use corticosteroid injections and traction as treatment option. Whether clinicians should prescribe physical therapy, bed rest, manipulation or medication could not be concluded from this review. At present there is no evidence that one type of treatment is clearly superior to others, including no treatment, for patients with a lumbosacral radicular syndrome.

### The contribution of RCTs to quality management and their feasibility in practice [^1112CubC]. European Spine Journal (2009). Low credibility.

The randomized controlled trial (RCT) is generally accepted as the most reliable method of conducting clinical research. To obtain an unbiased evaluation of the effectiveness of spine surgery, patients should be randomly assigned to either new or standard treatment. The aim of the present article is to provide a short overview of the advantages and challenges of RCTs and to present a summary of the conclusions of the Cochrane Reviews in spine surgery and later published trials in order to evaluate their contribution to quality management and feasibility in practice. From the searches, 130 RCTs were included, 95 from Cochrane Reviews and systematic reviews, and 35 from additional search. No study comparing surgery with sham surgery was identified. The first RCT in spine surgery was published in 1974 and compared debridement and ambulatory treatment in tuberculosis of the spine. The contribution of RCTs in spinal surgery has markedly increased over the last 10 years, which indicates that RCTs are feasible in this field. The results demonstrate missing quality specifications. Despite the number of published trials there is conflicting or limited evidence to support various techniques of instrumentation. The only intervention that receives strong evidence is discectomy for faster relief in carefully selected patients due to lumbar disc prolapse with sciatica. For future trials, authors, referees, and editors are recommended to follow the CONSORT statement. RCTs provide evidence to support clinical opinions before implementation of new techniques, but the individual clinical experience is still important for the doctor who has to face the patient.

### Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for low back pain: an updated cochrane review [^113fiims]. Spine (2008). Low credibility.

Study Design

A systematic review of randomized controlled trials.

Objectives

To assess the effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and COX-2 inhibitors in the treatment of nonspecific low back pain and to assess which type of NSAID is most effective.

Summary Of Background Data

NSAIDs are the most frequently prescribed medications worldwide and are widely used for patients with low back pain. Selective COX-2 inhibitors are currently available and used for patients with low back pain.

Methods

We searched the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials up to and including June 2007 if reported in English, Dutch, or German. We also screened references given in relevant reviews and identified trials. Randomized trials and double-blind controlled trials of NSAIDs in nonspecific low back pain with or without sciatica were included.

Results

In total, 65 trials (total number of patients = 11,237) were included in this review. Twenty-eight trials (42%) were considered high quality. Statistically significant effects were found in favor of NSAIDs compared with placebo, but at the cost of statistically significant more side effects. There is moderate evidence that NSAIDs are not more effective than paracetamol for acute low back pain, but paracetamol had fewer side effects. There is moderate evidence that NSAIDs are not more effective than other drugs for acute low back pain. There is strong evidence that various types of NSAIDs, including COX-2 NSAIDs, are equally effective for acute low back pain. COX-2 NSAIDs had statistically significantly fewer side effects than traditional NSAIDs.

Conclusion

The evidence from the 65 trials included in this review suggests that NSAIDs are effective for short-term symptomatic relief in patients with acute and chronic low back pain without sciatica. However, effect sizes are small. Furthermore, there does not seem to be a specific type of NSAID, which is clearly more effective than others. The selective COX-2 inhibitors showed fewer side effects compared with traditional NSAIDs in the randomized controlled trials included in this review. However, recent studies have shown that COX-2 inhibitors are associated with increased cardiovascular risks in specific patient populations.

### Timing of surgery for sciatica: subgroup analysis alongside a randomized trial [^113pmAhs]. European Spine Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Surgery speeds up recovery for sciatica. Prolonged conservative care with surgery for those patients with persistent sciatica however, yields similar results at 1 year. To investigate whether baseline variables modify the difference in recovery rates between these treatment strategies, baseline data of 283 patients enrolled in a randomized trial, comparing early surgery with prolonged conservative care, were used to analyse effect modification of the allotted treatment strategy. For predictors shown to modify the effect of the treatment strategy, repeated measurement analyses with the Roland Disability Questionnaire and visual analogue scale pain as continuous outcomes were performed for every level of that predictor. Presumed predictive variables did not have any interaction with treatment, while "sciatica provoked by sitting" showed to be a significant effect modifier (P = 0.07). In a Cox model we estimated a hazard ratio (HR, surgery versus conservative) of 2.2 (95% CI 1.7–3.0) in favour of surgery when sciatica was provoked by sitting, while the HR was 1.3 (95% CI 0.8–2.2) when this sign was absent. The interaction effect is marginally significant (interactions are usually tested at the 10% level) but the patterns generated by the repeated measurement analyses of all primary outcomes are completely consistent with the inferred pattern from the survival analysis. Classical signs did not show any contribution as decision support tools in deciding when to operate for sciatica, whereas treatment effects of early surgery are emphasized when sciatica is provoked by sitting and negligible when this symptom is absent.

### Targeting neurotrophic factors for low back pain and sciatica: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115tZadu]. Rheumatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

This meta-analysis aims to investigate the efficacy and safety of medicines that target neurotrophic factors for low back pain (LBP) or sciatica.

Methods

We searched published and trial registry reports of randomized controlled trials evaluating the effect of medicines that target neurotrophic factors to LBP or sciatica in seven databases from inception to December 2020. Two reviewers independently identified studies, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias and certainty in the evidence.

Results

Nine studies (3370 participants) were included in the meta-analyses. Low certainty evidence showed that anti-nerve growth factor (NGF) may reduce pain at 4weeks (mean difference [MD] -6.75, 95% CI: -8.61, -4.90) and 12weeks (MD -6.16, 95% CI: -8.38, -3.94), and may increase adverse effects for chronic LBP (odds ratio [OR] 1.18, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.38). Higher doses of anti-NGF may offer a clinically important reduction in pain at the cost of increased adverse effects for chronic LBP. Very low certainty evidence showed that anti-NGF and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (pro-GDNF) may not reduce pain for sciatica at 4weeks (MD -1.40, 95% CI: -8.26, 5.46), at 12weeks (MD -2.91, 95% CI: -13.69, 7.67) and may increase adverse effects for sciatica (OR 3.27, 95% CI: 1.78, 6.00).

Conclusion

Anti-NGF may offer small reductions in pain intensity for chronic LBP. The effect may depend on the dose and types of medicines. For sciatica, anti-NGF or pro-GDNF may not reduce pain. Medicines that target neurotrophic factors for LBP or sciatica are associated with different adverse effects compared to those observed in commonly prescribed medicines for these conditions.

### Surgical techniques for sciatica due to herniated disc, a systematic review [^113LsA6H]. European Spine Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Disc herniation with sciatica accounts for five percent of low-back disorders but is one of the most common reasons for spine surgery. The goal of this study was to update the Cochrane review on the effect of surgical techniques for sciatica due to disc herniation, which was last updated in 2007.

Materials and Methods

In April 2011, we conducted a comprehensive search in CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PEDRO, ICL, and trial registries. We also checked the reference lists and citation tracking results of each retrieved article. Only randomized controlled trials (RCT) of the surgical management of sciatica due to disc herniation were included. Comparisons including chemonucleolysis and prevention of scar tissue or comparisons against conservative treatment were excluded. Two review authors independently selected studies, assessed risk of bias of the studies and extracted data. Quality of evidence was graded according to the GRADE approach.

Results

Seven studies from the original Cochrane review were included and nine additional studies were found. In total, 16 studies were included, of which four had a low risk of bias. Studies showed that microscopic discectomy results in a significantly, but not clinically relevant longer operation time of 12 min (95% CI 2–22) and shorter incision of 24 mm (95% CI 7–40) compared with open discectomy, but did not find any clinically relevant superiority of either technique on clinical results. There were conflicting results regarding the comparison of tubular discectomy versus microscopic discectomy for back pain and surgical duration.

Conclusions

Due to the limited amount and quality of evidence, no firm conclusions on effectiveness of the current surgical techniques being open discectomy, microscopic discectomy, and tubular discectomy compared with each other can be drawn. Those differences in leg or back pain scores, operation time, and incision length that were found are clinically insignificant. Large, high-quality studies are needed, which examine not only effectiveness but cost-effectiveness as well.

### Patient preferences for treatment of lumbar disc herniation: a discrete choice experiment [^112m65sS]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

Lumbar discectomy is a frequently performed procedure to treat sciatica caused by lumbar disc herniation. Multiple surgical techniques are available, and the popularity of minimally invasive surgical techniques is increasing worldwide. Clinical outcomes between these techniques may not show any substantial differences. As lumbar discectomy is an elective procedure, patients' own preferences play an important role in determining the procedure they will undergo. The aims of the current study were to determine the relative preference weights patients apply to various attributes of lumbar discectomy, determine if patient preferences change after surgery, identify preference heterogeneity for choosing surgery for sciatica, and calculate patient willingness to pay for other attributes.

Methods

A discrete choice experiment (DCE) was conducted among patients with sciatica caused by lumbar disc herniation. A questionnaire was administered to patients before they underwent surgery and to an independent sample of patients who had already undergone surgery. The DCE required patients to choose between two surgical techniques or to opt out from 12 choice sets with alternating characteristic levels: waiting time for surgery, out-of-pocket costs, size of the scar, need of general anesthesia, need for hospitalization, effect on leg pain, and duration of the recovery period.

Results

A total of 287 patients were included in the DCE analysis. All attributes, except scar size, had a significant influence on the overall preferences of patients. The effect on leg pain was the most important characteristic in the decision for a surgical procedure (by 44.8%). The potential out-of-pocket costs for the procedure (28.8%), the wait time (12.8%), need for general anesthesia (7.5%), need for hospitalization (4.3%), and the recovery period (1.8%) followed. Preferences were independent of the scores on patient-reported outcome measures and baseline characteristics. Three latent classes could be identified with specific preference patterns. Willingness-to-pay was the highest for effectiveness on leg pain, with patients willing to pay €3133 for a treatment that has a 90% effectiveness instead of 70%.

Conclusions

Effect on leg pain is the most important factor for patients in deciding to undergo surgery for sciatica. Not all proposed advantages of minimally invasive spine surgery (e.g., size of the scar, no need of general anesthesia) are necessarily perceived as advantages by patients. Spine surgeons should propose surgical techniques for sciatica, not only based on own ability and proposed eligibility, but also based on patient preferences as is part of shared decision making.

### Epidural steroid compared to placebo injection in sciatica: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1178Ri8V]. European Spine Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to determine whether epidural steroid injections (ESI) are superior to epidural or non-epidural placebo injections in sciatica patients.

Methods

The PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of science databases were searched for trials comparing ESI to epidural or non-epidural placebo. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane RoB 2 tool. The primary outcome measures were pooled using a random-effects model for 6-week, 3-month, and 6-month follow-up. Secondary outcomes were described qualitatively. Quality of evidence was graded using GRADE classification.

Results

Seventeen out of 732 articles were included. ESI was superior compared to epidural placebo at 6 weeks (-8.6 [-13.4; -3.9]) and 3 months (-5.2 [-10.1; -0.2]) for leg pain and at 6 weeks for functional status (-4.1 [-6.5; -1.6]), though the minimally clinical important difference (MCID) was not met. There was no difference in ESI and placebo for back pain, except for non-epidural placebo at 3 months (6.9 [1.3; 12.5]). Proportions of treatment success were not different. ESI reduced analgesic intake in some studies and complication rates are low.

Conclusion

The literature indicates that ESI induces larger improvements in pain and disability on the short term compared to epidural placebo, though evidence is of low to moderate quality and MCID is not met. Strong conclusions for longer follow-up or for comparisons with non-epidural placebo cannot be drawn due to general low quality of evidence and limited number of studies. Epidural injections can be considered a safe therapy.

### Physical therapy plus general practitioners' care versus general practitioners' care alone for sciatica: a randomised clinical trial with a 12-month follow-up [^112imvE9]. European Spine Journal (2008). Low credibility.

Introduction

The lumbosacral radicular syndrome (LRS), also called sciatica, is a disorder with radiating pain in the leg below the knee in one or more lumbar or sacral dermatomes, and can be accompanied by phenomena associated with nerve root tension or neurological deficits. A prolapsed disc is a frequent cause of LRS, but other causes include spinal or lateral recess stenosis, tumours and radiculitis. The incidence of LRS in the Netherlands is estimated at 5 per 1,000 persons a year.

There is consensus that treatment of LRS in the first 6–8 weeks should be conservative. The exact content of the conservative treatment is, however not yet clear. After the study of Vroomen et al. bed rest is no longer regarded as a treatment option for LRS. Assessed in a recent systematic review was the effectiveness of conservative treatments of LRS. Thirty trials were included that evaluated injections (n = 14), traction (n = 9), physical therapy (PT) (n = 4), bed rest (n = 2), manipulation (n = 2), medication (n = 2) and acupuncture (n = 1) as a treatment for LRS. Because several trials indicated no evidence of an effect it is not recommended to use corticosteroid injections and traction as treatment option. Whether clinicians should prescribe PT, bed rest, manipulation or medication could not be concluded from this review. Therefore, there is no evidence that one type of conservative treatment is clearly superior to others for patients with LRS.

In an previous observational study it was shown that GPs did not adhere to the guideline regarding the referral to PT; almost half of patients with LRS were referred for PT, although this was not recommended in the guideline. No specific characteristic could be identified to explain this referral to PT. Moreover, there is a lack of knowledge concerning the effectiveness of PT in LRS. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the effectiveness of PT management additional to GP management compared to GP management alone, in patients with acute LRS.

### Surgery versus conservative management of sciatica due to a lumbar herniated disc: a systematic review [^11695GC2]. European Spine Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Surgery versus usual conservative care

One old study (n = 126) with a high risk of bias compared long-term outcomes of discectomy to conservative management. Both patient and observer ratings demonstrated that discectomy was significantly better than conservative treatment at 1 year. After 1 year, 24 of the 66 patients (36%) in the conservative care group versus 39 of the 60 patients (65%) in the surgery group reported a good outcome. No significant differences in outcomes were reported at 4 and 10 years follow-up.

One small trial (n = 56) with a high risk of bias compared microdiscectomy with conservative treatment in patients with sciatica for 6–12 weeks. Overall, no significant differences were found for leg pain or back pain, and subjective disability throughout the 2 years of follow-up. VAS leg pain scores, however, improved more rapidly in the discectomy group; 6 weeks scores in the surgery group was 12 (SD 20) versus 25 (SD 27) in the conservative group. The per-protocol analysis demonstrated no statistically significant differences.

A large trial (n = 501) with a low risk of bias in patients with sciatica for at least 6 weeks and confirmed disc herniation showed that both the surgery as well as the conservative treatment group improved substantially over 2 years for all primary and secondary outcome measures. The intention-to-treat analysis showed no statistically significant differences for any of the primary outcome measures. Of the patients randomised to surgery, 50% received surgery within 3 months of inclusion as compared with 30% who received surgery in the group randomised to conservative treatment. After 2 years of follow-up, 45% of patients in the conservative treatment group underwent surgery and 40% in the surgery group received conservative treatment.

In conclusion, there is conflicting evidence as to whether surgery is more beneficial than conservative care for short- and long-term follow-up.

### Surgery versus conservative management of sciatica due to a lumbar herniated disc: a systematic review [^113uwKUW]. European Spine Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Early surgery versus prolonged conservative care

One large randomised trial (n = 283) with a low risk of bias compared early surgery to prolonged conservative treatment followed by surgery if needed in patients with severe sciatica for 6–12 weeks. Of the patients, 89% randomised to early surgery underwent microdiscectomy after a mean of 2 weeks, while 39% of patients randomised to conservative treatment underwent surgery after a mean of 19 weeks. Relief of leg pain was faster for patients assigned to early surgery. Intention-to-treat analysis showed statistically significant more leg pain relief in favour of early surgery as compared with prolonged conservative care at 3 months (MD −17.70, 95% CI −23.1 to −12.3). There was no significant overall difference between the two groups in disability scores during the first year. The median time to recovery was 4.0 weeks [95% confidence interval (CI), 3.7–4.4] for early surgery and 12.1 weeks (95% CI, 9.5–14.9) for prolonged conservative treatment. During the first year, early surgery achieved a faster rate of perceived recovery with a hazard ratio of 1.97 (95% CI 1.72–2.22, P < 0.001). At 1 year of follow-up, however, 95% of patients in both treatment groups had experienced satisfactory recovery, and no subsequent differences were found. This lack of a difference between groups was maintained for the following year. In conclusion, one low-risk-of-bias study yielded a low level of evidence (GRADE) to the effect that early surgery was beneficial for pain relief as compared to prolonged conservative care in the short term, but not in the longer term with a faster recovery rate for early surgery.

### Westeinde sciatica trial: randomized controlled study of bed rest and physiotherapy for acute sciatica [^117Fdcsq]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2002). Low credibility.

Object

The authors conducted a study to compare the efficacies of three nonsurgical treatment strategies in patients with sciatica. Their hypothesis was that bed rest, physiotherapy, and continuation of activities of daily living (ADLs) (control treatment) are each of equivalent efficacy.

Methods

This randomized controlled trial was designed for comparison of bed rest, physiotherapy, and continuation of ADLs. The setting was an outpatient clinic. General practitioners were asked to refer patients for treatment as soon as possible. The authors enrolled 250 patients (< 60 years of age) with sciatica of less than 1-month's duration and who had not yet been treated with bed rest or physiotherapy. Primary outcome measures were radicular pain (based on a visual analog pain scale [VAPS]) and hampered ADLs (Quebec Disability Scale [QDS]). Secondary outcome measures were the rates of treatment-related failure and surgical treatment. Measures were assessed at baseline and during follow up at 1, 2, and 6 months. Mean differences in VAPS and QDS scores between bed rest and control treatment were 2.5 (95% confidence interval [CI] -6.4 to 11.4) and -4.8 (95% CI -10.6 to 0.9) at 1 month and 0.9 (95% CI -8.7 to 10.4) and -2.7 (95% CI -9.9 to 4.4) at 2 months, respectively. The respective differences between physiotherapy and control treatment were 0.8 (95% CI -8.2 to 9.8) and -0.5 (95% CI -6.3 to 5.3) at 1 month and -0.3 (95% CI -9.4 to 10) and 0.0 (95% CI -7.2 to 7.3) at 2 months. The respective odds ratios for treatment failure and surgical treatment of bed rest compared with control treatment were 1.6 (95% CI 0.8–3.5) and 1.5 (95% CI 0.7–3.6) at 6 months. When physiotherapy was compared with control treatment, these ratios were 1.5 (95% CI 0.7–3.2) and 1.2 (95% CI 0.5–2.9) at 6 months, respectively.

Conclusions

Bed rest and physiotherapy are not more effective in acute sciatica than continuation of ADLs.

### The role of systemic steroids in sciatica due to herniated lumbar disc: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117MptgD]. Spine (2023). Medium credibility.

Study Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis.

Objective

Evaluate the role of systemic steroids in treating patients with sciatica due to lumbar disk herniation (LDH).

Summary Of Background Data

The association between LDH and sciatica has been well described. The use of steroids seems logical in this context; however, their efficacy is not well described, and their use remains controversial.

Methods

A comprehensive search on PubMed, EMBASE, and Scopus databases (up to February 15, 2022) was performed to identify randomized clinical trials that included patients with symptoms of sciatica due to LDH that were treated with systemic steroids. The risk of bias was judged using the Cochrane risk-of-Bias2 tool. Meta-analysis was conducted using a random-effects model to estimate the between-group effect size for pain and functional outcomes. The risk of developing adverse events (AE) was computed using relative risks. All pooled results are reported with their 95% confidence interval (CI) and certainty of evidence analyzed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation framework.

Results

Ten studies met inclusion criteria, comprising a total of 1017 participants: 540 in the treatment group and 477 in the control group. Steroid treatment was associated with a significant superior reduction of pain (SMD = -0.42, 95% CI -0.76 to -0.08, weak effect, very-low certainty) and reduction in disability (SMD = -0.30, 95% CI -0.51 to -0.10, weak effect, very-low certainty). Corticosteroid administration was associated with a significant increased risk of developing an AE (relative risks = 2.00, 95% CI 1.40 to 2.85, low certainty).

Conclusion

The use of systemic steroids in the treatment of sciatica due to LDH seems reasonable despite a 2-fold higher risk of developing mild AEs. However, the effect size is small for reducing pain in the short term and improving functional outcomes at long-term follow-up.

### Surgery versus conservative management of sciatica due to a lumbar herniated disc: a systematic review [^111HRyc2]. European Spine Journal (2011). Low credibility.

The duration and intensity of the conservative treatment is poorly described in the included studies. There are many treatment regimens and modalities available for conservative treatment of sciatica varying from steroids to traction to physiotherapy interventions. Evidence from systematic reviews of conservative interventions for sciatica fail to identify the effect of one intervention over the other, however, large studies with a low risk of bias are scarce. In order to make an informed decision about the clinical homogeneity of the included comparisons, detailed information about the treatments is essential and the denomination "conservative treatment" is not sufficient.

Three narrative reviews which examined choice of surgery or conservative care concluded that surgery is indicated in presence of persistent neuromotor deficit. Both Awad and Moskovich and Legrand et al. suggested to let the patient make an informed choice. The review of Awad and Moskovich was published before publication of three of the studies included in this review. Although the publication of Legrand et al. was in 2007, this study did not include two studies published before that date. Gregory et al. promoted surgery with persistent neuromotor deficit or severe sciatica with a positive straight-leg-raise test and imaging demonstrating lumbar disc herniation at the nerve root level correlating with the patient's examination findings. Although published in October 2008, this study did not include three studies published before that date. Both reviews did not describe their search strategy, selection methods or quality assessments of the included studies and are therefore, potentially, prone to bias.

### Therapeutic efficacy and the impact of the "Dose" effect of acupuncture to treat sciatica: a randomized controlled pilot study [^117Kge3T]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To investigate the required sample size for and feasibility of a full-scale randomized controlled trial examining the impact of the "dose" effect of acupuncture in treating sciatica.

Patients and methods

Fifty-seven patients with sciatica, aged 35–70 years, were recruited and screened. Thirty-one participants were randomly assigned to receive "low-dose" manual acupuncture (MAL) (n = 15) or "high-dose" manual acupuncture (MAH) (n = 16). The acupuncture treatment was administered twice weekly for 4 weeks. The primary outcome was the visual analog scale (VAS) score at baseline and after 4 weeks of acupuncture treatment. Secondary outcomes included the Roland Disability Questionnaire for Sciatica (RDQS), the Sciatica Bothersomeness Index (SBI), and the World Health Organization Quality of Life in the Brief Edition (WHOQOL-BREF) scores at baseline and after 4 weeks of acupuncture treatment.

Results

Thirty patients completed the study. For all patients, acupuncture achieved significant improvement in the VAS (5.48 ± 2.0, p < 0.001), RDQS (3.18 ± 2.83, p = 0.004), and SBI (2.85 ± 3.23, p = 0.008) scores, but not in the WHOQOL-BREF scores. In the between-group analysis, the assessed scales showed no significant differences between the MAL and MAH groups. However, based on the level of chronicity, the MAH group demonstrated greater improvement in the outcomes and a significant benefit in the physical subscale of the WHOQOL-BREF (p < 0.05).

Conclusion

Results of this pilot study indicate that acupuncture is safe and may effectively relieve symptoms and disability in patients with non-acute sciatica. MAL was as effective as MAH in treating sciatica. A subsequent trial with a larger sample size (estimated at n = 96) is required to confirm whether patients with a high level of chronicity would benefit from MAH treatment.

### Comparative systematic review and meta-analysis of cochrane review of epidural injections for lumbar radiculopathy or sciatica [^1175azPX]. Pain Physician (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Epidural injections are among the most commonly performed procedures for managing low back and lower extremity pain. Pinto et al and Chou et al previously performed systematic reviews and meta-analyses, which, along with a recent update from Oliveira et al showing the lack of effectiveness of epidural steroid injections in managing lumbar disc herniation, spinal stenosis, and radiculopathy. In contrast to these papers, multiple other systematic reviews and meta-analyses have supported the effectiveness and use of epidural injections utilizing fluoroscopically guided techniques. A major flaw in the review can be related to attributing active-controlled trials to placebo-controlled trials. The assumption that local anesthetics do not provide sustained benefit, despite extensive evidence that local anesthetics provide long-term relief, similar to a combination of local anesthetic with steroids is flawed.

Study Design

The Cochrane Review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of epidural injections in managing chronic low back and lower extremity pain with sciatica or lumbar radiculopathy were reanalyzed using systematic methodology and meta-analysis.

Objectives

To re-evaluate Cochrane data on RCTs of epidural injections in managing chronic low back and lower extremity pain with sciatica or lumbar radiculopathy utilizing qualitative and quantitative techniques with dual-arm and single-arm analysis.

Methods

In this systematic review, we have used the same RCTs from the Cochrane Review of a minimum of 20% change in pain scale or significant pain relief of ≥ 50%. The outcome measures were pain relief and functional status improvement. Significant improvement was defined as 50% or greater pain relief and functional status improvement. Our review was performed utilizing the Cochrane Review methodologic quality assessment and the Interventional Pain Management Techniques - Quality Appraisal of Reliability and Risk of Bias Assessment (IPM-QRB). Evidence was summarized utilizing the principles of best evidence synthesis and the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) system. Clinical relevance of the pragmatic nature of each study was assessed.

Results

In evaluating the RCTs in the Cochrane Review, 10 trials were performed with fluoroscopic guidance. Utilizing conventional dual-arm and single-arm meta-analysis, the evidence is vastly different from the interpretation of the data within the Cochrane Review. The overall combined evidence is Level I, or strong evidence, at one and 3 months, and Level II, or moderate evidence, at 6 and 12 months.

Limitations

The limitation of this study is that only data contained in the Cochrane Review were analyzed.

Conclusion

A comparative systematic review and meta-analysis of the Cochrane Review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of epidural injections in managing chronic low back and lower extremity pain with sciatica or lumbar radiculopathy yielded different results. This review, based on the evidence derived from placebo-controlled trials and active-controlled trials showed Level I, or strong evidence, at one and 3 months and Level II at 6 and 12 months. This review once again emphasizes the importance of the allocation of studies to placebo-control and active-control groups, utilizing standards of practice with inclusion of only the studies performed under fluoroscopic guidance.

### Surgery versus conservative care for persistent sciatica lasting 4 to 12 months [^111CPR4z]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2020). Excellent credibility.

Background

The treatment of chronic sciatica caused by herniation of a lumbar disk has not been well studied in comparison with acute disk herniation. Data are needed on whether diskectomy or a conservative approach is better for sciatica that has persisted for several months.

Methods

In a single-center trial, we randomly assigned patients with sciatica that had lasted for 4 to 12 months and lumbar disk herniation at the L4-L5 or L5-S1 level in a 1:1 ratio to undergo microdiskectomy or to receive 6 months of standardized nonoperative care followed by surgery if needed. Surgery was performed by spine surgeons who used conventional microdiskectomy techniques. The primary outcome was the intensity of leg pain on a visual analogue scale (ranging from 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating more severe pain) at 6 months after enrollment. Secondary outcomes were the score on the Oswestry Disability Index, back and leg pain, and quality-of-life scores at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year.

Results

From 2010 through 2016, a total of 790 patients were screened; of those patients, 128 were enrolled, with 64 in each group. Among the patients assigned to undergo surgery, the median time from randomization to surgery was 3.1 weeks; of the 64 patients in the nonsurgical group, 22 (34%) crossed over to undergo surgery at a median of 11 months after enrollment. At baseline, the mean score for leg-pain intensity was 7.7 in the surgical group and 8.0 in the nonsurgical group. The primary outcome of the leg-pain intensity score at 6 months was 2.8 in the surgical group and 5.2 in the nonsurgical group (adjusted mean difference, 2.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.4 to 3.4; P < 0.001). Secondary outcomes including the score on the Owestry Disability Index and pain at 12 months were in the same direction as the primary outcome. Nine patients had adverse events associated with surgery, and one patient underwent repeat surgery for recurrent disk herniation.

Conclusions

In this single-center trial involving patients with sciatica lasting more than 4 months and caused by lumbar disk herniation, microdiskectomy was superior to nonsurgical care with respect to pain intensity at 6 months of follow-up.

### Cascade of decisions meet personal preferences in sciatica treatment decisions [^115dJ6rf]. BMJ Open Quality (2022). High credibility.

Results

Four steps in the care process proved relevant for the clinical pathway of patients. These were uncertainty about the diagnosis, analgesia, epidural injections and surgery. Patients and physicians differed in opinion on the subjects of a certain diagnosis and analgesia. They had relatively similar opinions with respect to the different treatment options. Different options existed on the topic of surgical treatment, within both the group of patients as well as the group of physicians. A summary of the positions of patients and physicians on the four steps is presented in table 3.

Table 3
A summary of the perspectives of patients and physicians on the four main topics

Certainty and diagnosis

After the onset of sciatica, two prominent decisions or conflicts appear, concerning (1) diagnosing sciatica and the need for MRI-imaging to confirm the diagnosis and (2) the appropriate timing for referral to the hospital. Physicians felt confident about diagnosing sciatica, although the GPs mentioned that they sometimes doubted their diagnosis. They would discuss such doubts with their patients and generally would wait to see how symptoms developed. GPs acknowledged that their first objective in patients with subjected sciatica is to help the patient through the first period of pain and restricted mobility, rather than to determine the 'true' diagnosis rapidly. When patients did not improve, or pushed for referral, GPs would refer to a neurologist earlier than the 6–8 weeks suggested in the guideline. However, because of waiting lists, these patients often waited a few weeks before a specialist was available, and the total duration of complaints generally exceeded 6 weeks.

Patients understood the 6–8 weeks of conservative treatment by the GP as mandatory 'waiting time', after which their diagnosis would be confirmed by a specialist and with an MRI scan. When a neurologist deemed the scan to be unnecessary, patients were disappointed. Physicians were conscious of such patient expectations. Some kept refusing, others gave in:

Sometimes you notice within a minute that whatever you say, it won't matter.… And in such cases you can say 'according to the guideline you are not entitled to a scan'. But I am not treating the guideline, I am treating the patient. In my experience, if you do not refer such a patient for a scan, if you do not manage to get the patient to understand, and you kind of quarrel with the patient, next month you will receive information from another hospital and they'll have made the scan.

### The mcKenzie method versus guideline-based advice in the treatment of sciatica: 24-month outcomes of a randomised clinical trial [^112WNPMt]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

To compare the effectiveness of a McKenzie Method intervention in patients with sciatica with guideline-based patient education.

Design

Multi-centre, assessor-blinded, parallel-group, randomised trial.

Setting

Two tertiary hospitals providing operative spinal care.

Subjects

Sciatica patients with magnetic resonance imaging-confirmed lumbar disc herniation compressing a nerve root.

Interventions

The McKenzie group received specific back exercises for seven visits combined with an educational book, and the Control group received a single session of self-management guidance according to usual practices.

Main Measures

The primary outcome was the number of surgical operations. Secondary outcomes were pain measured using the Visual Analogue Scale, disability using the Oswestry Disability Index and health-related quality of life using a RAND-36 questionnaire at baseline and 24-month follow-up.

Results

Altogether 66 patients, mean age of 43 years, of which 50% were females with long-lasting sciatica, mean 16 weeks, were randomised to two groups. Nineteen patients (29%) had surgery. There was no significant difference in surgery rates between the groups. Back and leg pain decreased, and disability improved in both groups. Health-related quality of life improved in six dimensions out of eight in both groups. There were no significant between-group changes in the patient-reported outcomes at the follow-up.

Conclusions

Multiple sessions of McKenzie-based back exercises with a McKenzie-specific patient's educational book produced effects equal to guideline-based advice at long-term follow-up. However, the power of these results is diminished due to the small patient population and confounding factors.

### A pilot study for effectiveness of non-pharmacological versus pharmacological treatment strategies for lumbar disc herniation: a pragmatic randomized controlled trial [^117WVCEo]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Lumbar disc herniation (LDH) is one of the most common causes of low back pain (LBP) and radiating leg pain (sciatica). The prevalence of sciatica vary from 1.6% in the general population to 43% in specific working populations. Most cases of sciatica caused by acute LDH show favorable outcomes and resolve within 2 weeks to 3 months. However, in some cases, LDH becomes a chronic condition of lifelong experience with LBP.

Conservative treatment should be the first-line therapy for sciatica; nonetheless, the best method of conservative treatment remains unclear, with guidelines differing in their recommendations. The American College of Physicians (ACP) recommends that non-pharmacological treatments, such as superficial heat treatment, massage, acupuncture, and spinal manipulation, should be selected for patients with LBP with or without sciatica. Among these various non-pharmacological treatments, there are many differences between guidelines for acupuncture and manual therapy. Korea guidelinesrecommend acupuncture and spinal manual therapy with high grade level of evidence. It suggested that acupuncture, electroacupuncture, and spinal manual therapy are helpful in improving pain and overall symptoms in patients with LDH. However, the United Kingdom (UK) guidelinesrecommend manual therapy only alongside an exercise program and against acupuncture. The Danish guidelinesalso state that acupuncture has low-quality evidence.

On the other hand, harms and serious adverse events for these non-pharmacological therapies have not been reported. In an RCT study on manual therapy for the neck, adverse events related to the musculoskeletal system and nervous system were observed in 5 patients (9.3%) in the intervention group, but all were mild or moderate side effects. In a systemic review of acupuncture treatment for a LDH patient, adverse events were reported in two trials, one reported no adverse events, and one reported local haematoma.

The recommendations for invasive treatment also vary widely depending on guidelines. Some recent guidelines, do not recommend epidural injections or facet joint injections, whereas the UK guidelinesrecommend epidural injections for patients with severe sciatica. The United States (US) guidelinesalso strongly recommend epidural injections for the management of sciatica or LDH. It suggested that transforaminal epidural steroid injections provide short-term (2–4 weeks) pain relief in LDH patients. Epidural injection is associated with serious adverse events such as plegia, spinal cord injury, dural hemorrhage, paralysis, stroke, and dural punctures, although the incidence rate is low.

### Therapeutic efficacy and the impact of the "Dose" effect of acupuncture to treat sciatica: a randomized controlled pilot study [^113wqGr8]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To investigate the required sample size for and feasibility of a full-scale randomized controlled trial examining the impact of the "dose" effect of acupuncture in treating sciatica.

Patients and Methods

Fifty-seven patients with sciatica, aged 35–70 years, were recruited and screened. Thirty-one participants were randomly assigned to receive "low-dose" manual acupuncture (MAL) (n = 15) or "high-dose" manual acupuncture (MAH) (n = 16). The acupuncture treatment was administered twice weekly for 4 weeks. The primary outcome was the visual analog scale (VAS) score at baseline and after 4 weeks of acupuncture treatment. Secondary outcomes included the Roland Disability Questionnaire for Sciatica (RDQS), the Sciatica Bothersomeness Index (SBI), and the World Health Organization Quality of Life in the Brief Edition (WHOQOL-BREF) scores at baseline and after 4 weeks of acupuncture treatment.

Results

Thirty patients completed the study. For all patients, acupuncture achieved significant improvement in the VAS (5.48 ± 2.0, p < 0.001), RDQS (3.18 ± 2.83, p = 0.004), and SBI (2.85 ± 3.23, p = 0.008) scores, but not in the WHOQOL-BREF scores. In the between-group analysis, the assessed scales showed no significant differences between the MAL and MAH groups. However, based on the level of chronicity, the MAH group demonstrated greater improvement in the outcomes and a significant benefit in the physical subscale of the WHOQOL-BREF (p < 0.05).

Conclusion

Results of this pilot study indicate that acupuncture is safe and may effectively relieve symptoms and disability in patients with non-acute sciatica. MAL was as effective as MAH in treating sciatica. A subsequent trial with a larger sample size (estimated at n = 96) is required to confirm whether patients with a high level of chronicity would benefit from MAH treatment.

### Surgical techniques for sciatica due to herniated disc, a systematic review [^112bomnw]. European Spine Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Management of sciatica that is caused by a herniated disc varies considerably. Patients are commonly treated in primary care, but a small proportion is referred to secondary care and may eventually undergo surgery if complaints persist for at least 6 weeks. Conservative treatment for sciatica is primarily aimed at pain reduction, either by analgesics or by reducing pressure on the nerve root. However, consensus is lacking as to whether surgery is useful or not in the absence of serious neurologic deficits. There seems to be consensus that surgery is indicated in carefully selected patients with sciatica and presence of a herniated lumbar disc. In most Western countries, especially in the United States, rates of spine surgery are high. The primary rationale of any form of surgery for sciatica due to herniated disc is to relieve nerve root irritation or compression, but the results should be balanced against the likely natural history and the results of conservative care. A recent systematic review indicated that surgery resulted in faster recovery when compared with conservative care, but for the longer term (12 months) no differences were found. The usual indication for surgery is to provide more rapid relief of pain and disability in the minority of patients whose recovery is unacceptably slow.

The most common type of surgery is microscopic discectomy, which is defined as surgical removal of part of the disc, performed with the use of an operating microscope or other magnifying tools. Most studies refer to Caspar, Yasargil, and Williams when discectomy is performed with a microscope; and to Foley and Smith or Greiner-Perth et al. when discectomy is performed with tubular, muscle splitting, retractor systems, and endoscope. However, some have returned to using a microscope, while retaining the less invasive muscle splitting approach of Foley and Smith. There is also uncertainty regarding the relative benefits and harms of different surgical techniques, as was concluded in the 2007 Gibson and Waddell Cochrane review on lumbar disc herniation. This review needs to be updated as several new randomized trials have come to our attention comparing surgical techniques. The objective of this systematic review was to assess the effectiveness of the various surgical techniques for discectomy, such as open, microscopic or tubular discectomy.

### Epidural injections for lumbar radiculopathy or sciatica: a comparative systematic review and meta-analysis of cochrane review [^113JhrMx]. Pain Physician (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Epidural injections are one of the commonly performed procedures in managing low back and lower extremity pain. In the past, Pinto et al and Chou et al performed systematic reviews and meta-analyses with a recent update from Oliveira et al showing lack of effectiveness of epidural steroid injections in managing lumbar radiculopathy. In contrast, multiple other systematic reviews and meta-analyses have supported the efficacy and use of epidural injections utilizing fluoroscopic guidance.

Study Design

A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of epidural injections in managing chronic low back and lower extremity pain with sciatica or lumbar radiculopathy.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy of 3 categories of epidural injections for lumbar radiculopathy or sciatica performed utilizing saline with steroids, local anesthetic alone, or steroids with local anesthetic.

Methods

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, RCTs with a placebo control or an active control design, performed under fluoroscopic guidance, with at least 6 months of followed-up were included. The outcome measures were pain relief and functional status improvement. Significant improvement was defined as 50% or greater pain relief and functional status improvement. Literature search was performed through January 2021. Methodological quality assessments were performed. Evidence was summarized utilizing principles of best evidence synthesis.

Results

In this analysis, a total of 21 RCTs were utilized with at least 6 months of follow-up and performed under fluoroscopic guidance. However, only 6 of 25 trials from Cochrane review met inclusion criteria for this review. Based on qualitative analysis, of the 21 trials included in the present analysis, there was only one placebo-controlled trial found to be negative. With conventional meta-analysis, there was no significant difference among the studies because all of the studies were active control with local anesthetic or local anesthetic and steroids. Further, with single-arm analysis, of the 5 trials included in that portion of the study, significant improvement was seen with local anesthetic alone compared to local anesthetic and steroids. There was a tendency for better improvement with steroids in terms of both pain relief and functional status. The level of evidence is Level I or strong for local anesthetic with steroids and Level I to II or moderate to strong for local anesthetic as a single agent based on multiple relevant high quality RCTs.

Limitations

Despite multiple trials available, there is a paucity of true RCTs performed under fluoroscopic guidance with any of the approaches.

Conclusion

Epidural injections with or without steroids for radiculopathy showed significant effectiveness with Level I or strong evidence for local anesthetic with steroids and Level II to I or moderate to strong evidence with local anesthetic alone.

### Surgeons preference for lumbar disk surgery: a discrete choice experiment [^115Cv7Br]. European Spine Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Multiple surgical techniques are practiced to treat sciatica caused by lumbar disk herniation. It is unknown which factors surgeons find important when offering certain surgical techniques. The objective of this study is threefold: 1) determine the relative weight surgeons place on various characteristics of sciatica treatment, 2) determine the trade-offs surgeons make between these characteristics and 3) identify preference heterogeneity for sciatica treatment.

Methods

A discrete choice experiment was conducted among members of two international neurosurgical organizations. Surgeons were asked on their preferences for surgical techniques using specific scenarios based on five characteristics: effectiveness on leg pain, risk of recurrent disk herniation, duration of postoperative back pain, risk of complications and recovery period.

Results

Six-hundred and forty-one questionnaires were filled in, the majority by neurosurgeons. All characteristics significantly influenced the preferences of the respondents. Overall, the risk of complications was the most important characteristic in the decision to opt-in or opt-out for surgery (35.7%). Risk of recurrent disk herniation (19.6%), effectiveness on leg pain (18.8%), postoperative back pain duration (13.5%) and length of recovery period (12.4%) followed. Four latent classes were identified, which was partly explained by the tenure of the surgeon. Surgeons were willing to trade-off 57.8% of effectiveness on leg pain to offer a treatment that has a 1% complication risk instead of 10%.

Conclusion

In the context of this discrete choice experiment, it is shown that neurosurgeons consider the risk of complications as most important when a surgical technique is offered to treat sciatica, while the risk of recurrent disk herniation and effectiveness are also important factors. Neurosurgeons were prepared to trade off substantial amounts of effectiveness to achieve lower complication rates.

### Surgical microdiscectomy versus transforaminal epidural steroid injection in patients with sciatica secondary to herniated lumbar disc (NERVES): a phase 3, multicentre, open-label, randomised controlled trial and economic evaluation [^113yXFzx]. The Lancet: Rheumatology (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Herniated lumbar disc resulting in back and leg pain travelling below the knee, sciatica, or radiculopathy is a worldwide burden to society. The condition affects an estimated 11% of patients presenting to their primary-care provider worldwide, with an annual prevalence estimated to be 2·2%. Generally, outcomes are favourable and 80% of patients improve with conservative care within 12–24 months. However, given that patients affected by this condition are typically aged 40–45 years, there is a risk of loss of livelihood if it is not managed promptly.

Treatment options have been considered by various expert-led guidelines, but no consensus exists for transforaminal epidural steroid injection (TFESI) due to a scarcity of class I evidence. Generally, once analgesia and lifestyle-modifying treatments have failed, steroid nerve root injections and surgical microdiscectomy are recommended for severe persistent cases. Stepwise care approaches based on treatment with non-opioids have been identified as likely to represent a more cost-effective approach than strategies involving direct referral for disc surgery; however, evidence for a stepwise treatment progression involving TFESI is scarce. Following various randomised trials comparing surgical treatments with non-surgical therapy, surgery is often deemed the most successful treatment option, leading to more than 10 000 discectomy procedures per year in the UK and 190 000 such procedures in the United States. The costs to the UK's National Health Service (NHS) for microdiscectomy (requiring patients to be hospitalised for 2 nights, on average) are approximately £4500 compared with £700 for TFESI.

The Lancet: Rheumatology (2021). High credibility.

Research in context

Evidence before this study

There is considerable uncertainty about the clinical effectiveness of epidurals in sciatica compared with surgery for treatment of herniated lumbar disc. However, transforaminal epidural steroid injection (TFESI), a newer and more precise treatment option, offered promise given that it can deliver the drug in a closer proximity to the site of pathology. We searched PubMed using the term "sciatica epidural steroid" immediately before the initial development of the NERVES protocol in 2013–14 and found that previous evidence supporting TFESI had come from cohort studies or single-centre studies, without clear specification of the non-surgical treatments provided. A meta-analysis from 2015 suggested that non-opioid analgesia, TFESI, and surgery were effective management options for sciatica secondary to uncomplicated herniated lumbar disc. However, the effectiveness of TFESI compared with surgery for herniated lumbar disc was uncertain, leading to wide variation in management guidelines for this common condition.

Added value of this study

NERVES is the first multicentre randomised trial directly comparing surgical microdiscectomy with TFESI on a 1:1 allocation basis as initial invasive treatment for sciatica secondary to herniated lumbar disc. There was no significant difference between TFESI and surgery pathways in clinical outcome, and surgery is unlikely to be a cost-effective alternative to TFESI. Complications of surgery were significant, offsetting any benefits of surgery as an early treatment, whereas only minor adverse events were seen with TFESI.

Implications of all the available evidence

NERVES provides high-quality evidence for a stepwise treatment framework of uncomplicated sciatica secondary to herniated lumbar disc with symptom duration of up to 12 months. TFESI would be less costly as an initial alternative to surgery for this condition, while achieving similar levels of improved outcomes.

ASIPP epidural guidelines — sciatica management reviews state that epidural steroid was recommended as a good intervention due to superiority in reducing ODI, with intravenous and subcutaneous anti-TNF-α identified as the optimal treatment for both acute and chronic sciatica; a systematic review and network meta-analysis by Lewis et al supported the effectiveness of epidural injections in the same line as disc surgery and nonopioid medication, and Lee et al concluded that epidural injection was strongly recommended with high degree of evidence and that the transforaminal approach was more strongly recommended than caudal approach.

### Does two weeks of bed rest bring about relief from… [^116nftcN]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

Few studies support the recommendation that bed rest be instituted for the treatment of low back pain and sciatica. Nonetheless, many patients and physicians seem to favor this form of therapy, especially in the acute period. Vroomen and colleagues performed a randomized, controlled, blinded trial to evaluate the efficacy of bed rest in the treatment of sciatica. The 183 patients entering the study presented to their primary physicians with back pain that radiated into the leg. Excluded were persons who had previously undergone spinal surgery, were involved with workers' compensation claims or had severe coexisting disease. History, physical examination and magnetic resonance imaging of the lumbar spine were obtained. Patients who did not have strong clinical evidence of sciatica or were found to have an indication, such as cauda equina syndrome, for immediate surgery were excluded.

Patients kept diaries of their functional status and the number of hours they spent in bed each day. A visual analog scale was used for self-reports of the degree of pain. Patients were allowed to take 1, 000 mg of acetaminophen three times a day, supplemented by 10 to 40 mg of codeine six times a day or 500 mg of naprosyn three times a day. Follow-up office visits to assess pain and functional status were made at two and 12 weeks. A home visit was made during the third week. The investigators who did the assessments did not know the patients' treatment status. At 12 weeks, 87 percent of the patients in each group reported improvement. The investigators' assessment of improvement at two weeks was 73 percent for the bed-rest group and 65 percent for the control group. At 12 weeks, the investigators' assessments were 86 percent improvement for the bed-rest group and 89 percent improvement for the control group.

Diary entries revealed that the bed-rest group spent an average of 21 hours daily in bed, compared with 10 hours for the control group. The authors conclude that bed rest is not more effective than watchful waiting in patients with sciatica-type symptoms related to lumbosacral injury. This finding is in keeping with the findings of at least three other previously published studies.
