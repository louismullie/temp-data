## Question

Enteral nutrition in obese patient

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about enteral nutrition in obese patients. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and why obesity complicates nutrition in critical illness. Then, I should verify the timing and route of enteral nutrition initiation. Next, I will calculate energy and protein targets using guideline-based methods and acknowledge uncertainties. After that, I need to select an appropriate enteral formula and delivery strategy. Then, I should set a monitoring and adjustment plan, including glycemic and respiratory surveillance. I will also consider special populations such as post-bariatric surgery and pediatrics. Finally, I will synthesize a practical algorithm and highlight evidence gaps and controversies, ensuring each step is supported by current guidelines and key studies.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and why obesity matters nutritionally in the ICU. Obesity alters energy expenditure, substrate utilization, and protein catabolism; critically ill obese patients often have insulin resistance, sarcopenic obesity, and a pro-inflammatory milieu that complicate nutrition delivery and outcomes, so I need to ensure my plan addresses both overfeeding risk and protein preservation [^11523RDi] [^115L42Wd] [^117PsH4w]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — despite the so-called obesity paradox, malnutrition and sarcopenia in obesity worsen outcomes, so I should screen and assess nutrition status promptly and tailor support accordingly [^117PsH4w] [^111PmHQe].

> I should confirm timing and route next. Early enteral nutrition within 24–48 hours of ICU admission is recommended for obese patients who cannot sustain volitional intake, provided they are hemodynamically stable and have a functional GI tract, because EN is preferred over PN when feasible and is associated with fewer infectious complications and shorter length of stay in general ICU populations [^116J1SML] [^114w5cuG] [^111JdG9D]. Wait, let me verify the hemodynamic caveat — EN should be deferred or minimized in unstable shock requiring escalating vasopressors until perfusion improves, aligning with broader critical care nutrition guidance [^116UgiKe].

> Now, I need to calculate energy targets, and I should double-check the weight basis. If indirect calorimetry is available, I will target 65–70% of measured energy expenditure to avoid overfeeding; if IC is unavailable, I will use 11–14 kcal/kg actual body weight per day for BMI 30–50 kg/m², and 22–25 kcal/kg ideal body weight per day for BMI > 50 kg/m², recognizing that these are consensus-based and may underestimate or overestimate needs in individual patients [^116CGuZh] [^114kHRFX]. Hold on, I should verify the magnitude of error — prospective data show guideline estimates can be off by roughly 950–1600 kcal/day compared with measured expenditure, reinforcing the need for frequent reassessment and clinical judgment [^114QZ4MT].

> Next, I should review protein targets and make sure I apply the right weight metric. For critically ill obese adults, protein should be prioritized at 2.0–2.5 g/kg ideal body weight per day, with higher ends of the range for class III obesity, to counteract anabolic resistance and preserve lean mass during hypocaloric feeding. If IBW is not available, some sources allow 1.2–1.5 g/kg adjusted body weight as a pragmatic alternative, but I need to ensure renal and hepatic function can safely handle the nitrogen load [^116CGuZh] [^111w1sfa] [^1125vnep]. Wait, let me verify the evidence signal — although mortality data are underpowered, observational and small RCT signals associate adequate protein with improved outcomes, supporting the emphasis on protein adequacy even under hypocaloric energy delivery [^111w1sfa] [^1125vnep].

> I will now examine formula selection and delivery strategy. A high-protein, low-calorie enteral formula with reduced nonprotein calorie-to-nitrogen ratio is preferred in obese ICU patients. If available, a lower caloric density product helps deliver protein without excess energy, and continuous pump delivery is generally favored early to enhance tolerance and glycemic control, with advancement to goal over 48–72 hours when feasible [^112n8d8E] [^116HN3Ni] [^111JdG9D]. Let me consider macronutrient composition — very high-protein, lower-carbohydrate EN formulas have been tested and reduced hyperglycemia and insulin requirements in small RCTs of overweight/obese ICU patients, suggesting a potential glycemic advantage, though primary composite endpoints were not significantly changed and larger trials are needed [^1158eMKj] [^117UYYhJ] [^115XHTZ6].

> I need to ensure a robust monitoring and adjustment plan. Daily weights, strict intake/output, and electrolytes should be tracked, with additional surveillance for hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, hypercapnia, fluid overload, and hepatic steatosis given the obesity-specific risks. EN tolerance should be assessed each shift, and if persistent intolerance limits protein delivery, I should consider small bowel access or, after 3–7 days of inadequate EN, supplemental parenteral nutrition to meet protein goals while avoiding overfeeding [^1172jbz5] [^116HN3Ni] [^111JdG9D]. Hold on, I should verify glycemic targets — consistent with ICU practice, aiming for 80–150 mg/dL using insulin protocols while avoiding hypoglycemia is reasonable, and the lower-carbohydrate, higher-protein EN approach may modestly reduce insulin requirements in obese patients [^1158eMKj].

> But wait, what if the patient is post-bariatric surgery or has altered anatomy. I should confirm micronutrient deficiencies and use a high-protein, hypocaloric regimen when EN or PN is indicated, with careful attention to thiamine, B12, folate, iron, vitamin D, and other deficiencies; PN should be reserved for those who cannot meet needs enterally for 3–7 days depending on illness severity, and refeeding risk must be mitigated with cautious dextrose advancement and electrolyte monitoring [^111kzZuJ] [^116VbRZq]. Let me reconsider the route — post-pyloric feeding may be advantageous if gastric emptying is impaired or if aspiration risk is high, which is not uncommon after certain bariatric procedures [^111JdG9D].

> I should also address pediatrics separately because adult equations do not translate. For critically ill children with obesity, a detailed nutrition assessment should occur within 48 hours and be repeated weekly; energy and protein targets should be individualized using pediatric-specific approaches, and both under- and overfeeding must be avoided given risks of refeeding and hyperglycemia in obese children [^111i28cS] [^113vqXza]. Hold on, I should verify that the evidence quality is low and recommendations are largely consensus-based, which underscores the need for close monitoring and frequent reassessment in this group [^111i28cS].

> Next, I should review the evidence gaps and controversies so I do not overstate certainty. The quality of evidence for hypocaloric, high-protein feeding in obese ICU patients is low, with mixed results across small studies; permissive underfeeding has not consistently improved mortality in broader ICU populations, and the optimal protein dose, timing, and duration remain unsettled, necessitating individualized care and shared decision-making [^112wx3Mo] [^11336tiA] [^1125vnep]. Hmm, wait a minute — some observational data suggest worse outcomes with early nutrition in certain subgroups, but these are confounded by severity and practice variation; I should not let that deter early EN in appropriately selected obese patients, but I must reassess frequently and tailor to response [^116satxy].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm and double-check alignment with guidelines. Screen all obese ICU patients for nutrition risk within 48 hours and complete a full assessment including comorbidities, inflammation, and body composition when feasible; initiate EN within 24–48 hours if hemodynamically stable; calculate energy at 65–70% of IC or use weight-based proxies as above; prioritize protein at 2.0–2.5 g/kg IBW/day; select a high-protein, lower-NPC:N formula when available; deliver continuously with pump and advance to goal over 48–72 hours; monitor daily for tolerance, glycemia, respiratory status, and fluid balance; adjust the regimen every 3–5 days or with clinical changes; escalate to post-pyloric feeding or add SPN if protein goals remain unmet after 3–7 days despite best EN efforts [^116J1SML] [^116CGuZh] [^116HN3Ni] [^111LnqAL]. I should confirm that this approach balances the risks of overfeeding against the harms of protein underdelivery, which is the crux of care in critically ill obesity [^111gmCyq].

> Finally, I need to ensure ongoing quality improvement and education are embedded. Obese ICU patients are less likely to receive early nutrition and often fall short of protein targets, so institutional protocols, nurse-driven advancement algorithms, and dietitian-led daily reviews can mitigate underdelivery. Addressing weight stigma and implicit bias is also essential to avoid therapeutic nihilism in this population [^116satxy] [^116aDg6y]. Hold on, I should verify that multidisciplinary collaboration with ICU pharmacists, nurses, and physicians improves adherence and outcomes — consensus statements emphasize individualized, team-based nutrition support as standard of care in complex patients [^114XtNHm].

Enteral nutrition in obese patients should be **high-protein, hypocaloric** to preserve lean mass and avoid overfeeding [^116CGuZh] [^111gmCyq]. Energy targets are **11–14 kcal/kg actual weight/day** for BMI 30–50 kg/m² [^116CGuZh] and **22–25 kcal/kg ideal weight/day** for BMI > 50 kg/m²; protein targets are **2.0–2.5 g/kg ideal weight/day** [^111w1sfa]. Start EN within **24–48 hours** [^116J1SML] if intake is inadequate, using a low-calorie, high-protein formula [^112n8d8E] with reduced nonprotein calories [^112n8d8E]. Monitor for refeeding syndrome, hyperglycemia, and intolerance [^1172jbz5]; adjust the regimen based on response and comorbidities [^114kHRFX]. This approach improves insulin sensitivity, reduces complications, and preserves lean mass [^111gmCyq] [^113iP34o].

---

## Energy requirements

Energy needs in obesity are lower per kilogram due to **lower metabolic activity of adipose tissue** [^notfound]; therefore, **hypocaloric feeding** is recommended to avoid overfeeding and its complications [^111gmCyq].

| **BMI category** | **Energy target** |
|-|-|
| BMI 30–50 kg/m² | 11–14 kcal/kg actual body weight/day [^116CGuZh] |
| BMI > 50 kg/m² | 22–25 kcal/kg ideal body weight/day [^116CGuZh] |

---

These targets align with **ASPEN/SCCM guidelines** [^116CGuZh] and should be individualized based on clinical status and indirect calorimetry when available [^114kHRFX].

---

## Protein requirements

Obese patients require **higher protein intake** to preserve lean body mass and counteract catabolism [^111gmCyq] [^112wx3Mo]. The **recommended protein intake** is 2.0 g/kg ideal body weight/day for BMI 30–40 kg/m² and 2.5 g/kg ideal body weight/day for BMI ≥ 40 kg/m² [^116CGuZh] [^111w1sfa].

---

## Timing and route of enteral nutrition

Early enteral nutrition (within **24–48 hours**) [^116J1SML] is recommended for obese patients who cannot maintain volitional intake, as it preserves gut integrity, reduces infections, and improves outcomes [^116HN3Ni]. The **preferred route** is gastric feeding when feasible; post-pyloric feeding is reserved for gastric intolerance or high aspiration risk [^111JdG9D].

---

## Formula selection

Selecting an appropriate enteral formula is critical. A **low-calorie, high-protein formula** with a reduced nonprotein calorie-to-nitrogen ratio is recommended to meet protein needs without excess calories [^112n8d8E] [^114Doa4e]. Key **formula characteristics** include high protein content (≥ 20% of total calories), low carbohydrate content to mitigate hyperglycemia [^1158eMKj], and added fiber to enhance satiety and glycemic control.

---

## Monitoring and complications

Obese patients on enteral nutrition require **close monitoring** for complications:

- **Refeeding syndrome**: Risk increases with prolonged inadequate intake; monitor electrolytes and initiate feeding cautiously [^114WDc6t].
- **Hyperglycemia**: Common due to insulin resistance; monitor glucose closely and adjust insulin therapy [^1172jbz5].
- **Feeding intolerance**: Monitor for nausea, vomiting, and delayed gastric emptying; consider prokinetic agents or post-pyloric feeding if needed [^111JdG9D].

---

## Clinical outcomes

High-protein, hypocaloric enteral nutrition in obese patients is associated with **improved insulin sensitivity**, reduced infectious complications, shorter ICU stay, and preserved lean body mass [^111gmCyq] [^112wx3Mo].

---

## Special considerations

- **Bariatric surgery patients**: Adjust formula selection and monitoring for altered gastrointestinal anatomy and nutrient absorption [^116VbRZq].
- **Comorbidities**: Tailor nutrition therapy to renal, hepatic, and cardiovascular comorbidities [^114Doa4e].

---

Enteral nutrition in obese patients should be **high-protein, hypocaloric**, initiated early, and individualized to meet protein needs while avoiding overfeeding. This approach improves metabolic outcomes, reduces complications, and preserves lean body mass [^116CGuZh].

Conclusions

Nutrition support in the critically ill has to date focused on adequate provision of energy to the patient. Protein and AA provision has been dealt with as a subcomponent of energy supply. However, proteins and AAs are fundamental to recovery and survival, not only to preserve active tissue (protein) mass but also to maintain a variety of other essential functions. The scientific recognition of the importance of protein is growing, and although optimal protein dosing studies are not available, expert opinion supports administering in excess of 1.2 g/kg/day. The use of one fixed protein-to-energy ratio to achieve both energy intake and protein intake targets often results in protein underfeeding or energy overfeeding. A mixed approach with a range of enteral or parenteral formulas may therefore help to balance protein and energy targeted feeding. The identification of a target for protein provision for individual patients is a crucial step in recognizing the key role of protein in nutrition support, especially for obese and older patients (with low muscle mass) who are seen in increasing numbers in the ICU. Further research is urgently needed to assess the specific quantitative and qualitative requirements of these patient subgroups.

A.S.P.E.N. clinical guidelines — hypocaloric, high protein feeding targets: Clinical outcomes are at least equivalent with high protein, hypocaloric feeding compared with high protein, eucaloric feeding, and a trial of hypocaloric, high protein feeding is suggested in patients without severe renal or hepatic dysfunction. Hypocaloric feeding may be started with 50%-70% of estimated energy needs or < 14 kcal/kg actual weight, and high protein feeding may be started with 1.2 g/kg actual weight or 2–2.5 g/kg ideal body weight, with adjustment by nitrogen balance studies (Recommendation: Weak Evidence: Low).

### Association between early nutrition support and 28-day mortality in critically ill patients: the FRANS prospective nutrition cohort study [^116satxy]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this prospective observational study, almost two-thirds of the critically ill patients received early nutrition, primarily by the enteral route, as suggested by nutrition guidelines; however, energy and protein targets were met in only half and one-third of the patients, respectively. Early nutrition was more frequently observed in patients with multiple organ failure and less frequently in overweight and obese patients.

The administration of early nutrition by any route was significantly associated with increased 28-day mortality. This association was stronger in younger patients and those with less severe organ failure. Compared to patients who received no early nutrition, early enteral and parenteral nutrition appeared to be associated with increased mortality in the multivariable multilevel analysis; these associations remained significant in the propensity-weighted analysis for early enteral but not early parenteral nutrition. Situated within the literature, the four key findings of this study are as follows:

First, our study of nutrition practices revealed that more than three-quarters of the patients received nutrition support in the ICU and that their energy and especially protein intakes were below recommended targets. These results are consistent with those reported in recent nutrition trials. A possible explanation might be the difficulties in reaching energy targets via the enteral route, chosen for 60% of our patients, with one-third suffering from feeding intolerance. Furthermore, the overall intakes may have been lower than in previous studies given that the reported volumes were the ones actually received by patients and not just the prescribed ones, even though we have taken into account the non-nutritional calories. Indeed, the difference between prescribed and actual intakes in the literature ranges from 10 to 30% due to digestive intolerance, airway management and organisational constraints. Regarding factors associated with early nutrition prescription, we observed that overweight and obese patients were less likely to receive early nutrition than patients with BMIs < 25 kg/m². Similar results were previously found in an observational study reporting delayed nutrition support in obese critically ill patients. This might result from the erroneous assumption that overweight and obese patients have sufficient resources to withstand the hypercatabolism associated with ICU stress. However, these patients may suffer from sarcopenic obesity at admission, which can worsen with protein malnutrition and ICU-acquired muscle weakness. Recent data showing a protective effect of adipose tissue on sarcopenia attest to the complexity of energy metabolism in these patients and the need for further research.

Objectives

To investigate the association between body mass index and mortality in a large, ICU population and determine if the relationship is observed among a subgroup of patients ordered early enteral nutrition.

Design

Retrospective cohort study within a national clinical mixed ICU database of patients admitted between January 1, 2008, and June 30, 2015.

Setting

Initial ICU admissions among patients monitored by tele-ICU programs and recorded in the Philips eICU Research Institute database.

Patients

A total of 1,042,710 adult patient stays with ICU length of stay more than 24 hours, of which 74,771 were ordered enteral nutrition within the first 48 hours.

Intervention

None.

Measurements and Main Results

Patient stays from 409 ICUs were included. The average age, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation IV score, and hospital mortality were 63.6 years, 56.7, and 9.0%, respectively. Hospital mortality among body mass index categories was estimated by multivariable modified Poisson regression models. Compared with the body mass index category 25.0–29.9kg/m², hospital mortality was higher among underweight (body mass index, < 18.5; relative risk, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.32–1.39), normal weight (body mass index, 18.5–24.9; relative risk, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.09–1.12), and the extremely obese (body mass index, ≥ 50.0; relative risk, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.05–1.15). However, the risk was not statistically different from patients with body mass index 30.0–49.9kg/m². Among patients ordered early enteral nutrition, the risk of mortality in the body mass index category 25.0–29.9kg/m was not statistically different from those in the normal weight or extremely obese groups.

Conclusions

A survival advantage for overweight and obese patients was observed in this large cohort of critically ill patients. However, among those ordered early enteral nutrition, the survival disadvantage for body mass index categories less than 25.0kg/m was minimal or unobservable when compared with higher body mass index categories.

### A systematic review on the agreement between clinical practice guidelines regarding the steps of the nutrition care process of adult patients who are critically ill [^114BvuSo]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) for the nutrition management of adult patients who are critically ill present divergences on recommendations regarding the nutrition care process (NCP), which bring difficulties in their application. We aimed to compare the recommendations from these CPGs and present a synthesis of them for each step of the NCP in intensive care unit (ICU) settings.

Methods

Systematic review of CPGs on nutrition care in ICU, searched in six databases up to January 2022. We have extracted data about CPGs, steps of the NCP, and quality of evidence for each recommendation. We compiled the recommendations from each CPG for each step of the NCP and calculated the relative frequency of agreement between them.

Results

Ten CPGs were reviewed, and 9 made recommendations for energy requirement, time to start, and route for nutrition support; however, only 3 presented recommendations on nutrition monitoring. The relative frequency of agreement between the recommendations of the CPGs ranges from 11% to 100%. The highest agreement was for the determination of energy requirements by indirect calorimetry and the provision of high protein for patients who are obese (100%). The lowest agreement among the CPGs was for considering either enteral nutrition or parenteral nutrition (PN) as an acceptable route (11%) and when to start PN (16.7%). Most recommendations were based on expert consensus.

Conclusions

There is a wide divergence on the recommendations to NCP of patients who are critically ill. This systematic review summarizes recommendations to evidence-based practice in ICU settings to facilitate the daily decisions of professionals.

### Nutrition therapy of the severely obese, critically ill patient: summation of conclusions and recommendations [^113iP34o]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2011). Low credibility.

This report compiles the conclusions and recommendations for nutrition therapy of the obese, critically ill patient derived by the group of experts participating in this workshop on obesity in critical care nutrition. The recommendations are based on consensus opinions of the group after review of the current literature. Obesity clearly adds to the complexity of nutrition therapy in the intensive care unit (ICU). Obesity alters the incidence and severity of comorbidities, tolerance of the prescribed regimen, and ultimately patient outcome through the course of hospitalization. Although the basic principles of critical care nutrition apply to the obese ICU patient, a high-protein, hypocaloric regimen should be provided to reduce the fat mass, improve insulin sensitivity, and preserve lean body mass. The ideal enteral formula should have a low nonprotein calorie to nitrogen ratio and have a variety of pharmaconutrient agents added to modulate immune responses and reduce inflammation.

### Evolution of multidisciplinary obesity treatments: past, present, and future role of nutrition [^115tNNoZ]. Obesity (2025). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

Obesity is a complex disease and a global health concern that requires innovative strategies to achieve durable weight reduction and maintenance with a reduced risk of common obesity complications. The complexity and multifaceted nature of obesity, including the considerable psychological impact of the disease, suggest the need for a multidisciplinary approach that addresses individual patient lifestyle factors as well as prevents or minimizes recurring experiences of weight reduction and regain to prevent further cardiometabolic consequences. Although the treatment paradigm for obesity continues to be founded on lifestyle interventions that support nutrition and physical activity, durable weight reduction management is achieved with bariatric procedures and, more recently, a new generation of effective OMs. As patients experience weight reduction during treatment, nutrition plays an integral role in supporting health while reducing the risk of excessive muscle mass or function loss. Beyond the provision of adequate dietary protein and micronutrients based on patient needs and comorbidities, promising effects seen in initial studies suggest that supplementation with HMB may show potential for use in patients at risk for muscle loss, including those under treatment for obesity. The effects of HMB in patients with obesity, especially those receiving OMs that achieve rapid weight reduction, should be determined with additional research focus. Meanwhile, the gut microbiome and specific metabolic phenotypes are two areas requiring further research as the medical community continues its work to address obesity as a public health crisis. Current evidence suggests a future role for precision nutrition strategies that consider aspects of a patient's experience of obesity beyond a one‐size‐fits‐all approach to intervention.

### The intensive care medicine research agenda in nutrition and metabolism [^115L2cfM]. Intensive Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

The objectives of this review are to summarize the current practices and major recent advances in critical care nutrition and metabolism, review common beliefs that have been contradicted by recent trials, highlight key remaining areas of uncertainty, and suggest recommendations for the top 10 studies/trials to be done in the next 10 years.

Methods

Recent literature was reviewed and developments and knowledge gaps were summarized. The panel identified candidate topics for future trials in critical care nutrition and metabolism. Then, members of the panel rated each one of the topics using a grading system (0–4). Potential studies were ranked on the basis of average score.

Results

Recent randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have challenged several concepts, including the notion that energy expenditure must be met universally in all critically ill patients during the acute phase of critical illness, the routine monitoring of gastric residual volume, and the value of immune-modulating nutrition. The optimal protein dose combined with standardized active and passive mobilization during the acute phase and post-acute phase of critical illness were the top ranked studies for the next 10 years. Nutritional assessment, nutritional strategies in critically obese patients, and the effects of continuous versus intermittent enteral nutrition were also among the highest-ranking studies.

Conclusions

Priorities for clinical research in the field of nutritional management of critically ill patients were suggested, with the prospect that different nutritional interventions targeted to the appropriate patient population will be examined for their effect on facilitating recovery and improving survival in adequately powered and properly designed studies, probably in conjunction with physical activity.

Clinical considerations

It is important to understand the limitations of available tools when calculating energy needs and their low applicability to patients with obesity. If utilized, predictive equations should only be one aspect of a nutrition assessment for these complex patients and limitations should be recognized. Clinical staff should review individual nutritional requirements and consider factors that affect energy needs on a regular basis such as changes in clinical status including fever and infection, major postoperative procedures, and increased mobility and physical activity. This is necessary as patients' needs can frequently and rapidly change over the course of critical illness. Finally, regardless of BMI and the determined energy target, it is important to recognize that hospitalized patients, especially those in the ICU, frequently do not consume or receive the amount of nutrition prescribed. Ultimately, the nutritional management of critically ill patients with obesity should be undertaken with the intention of reducing net protein catabolism without concurrent feeding complications and worsening of physical function and clinical outcomes.

### American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition research agenda [^112ETjvq]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2014). Medium credibility.

Malnutrition assessment, diagnosis, and intervention in the context of nutrition support therapy — malnutrition has been defined using varied criteria in diverse patient populations, and this variability has created difficulties in capturing the true prevalence of this condition; trends in practice have resulted in the need for a more precise definition. Examples include advances in technology enabling clinicians to respond more effectively to candidates for nutrition support; evidence-based acute care that has improved overall short-term survival yet increased the number of acutely and severely ill patients at risk of nutrition deficits; the global obesity epidemic challenging prior assessment schemes; and U.S. cost containment pressures where nutrition support is a relatively expensive intervention associated with considerable risk. These trends have converged and have resulted in the need to develop a consensus definition that ideally would enable common language and consistent management plans. A critical gap that requires immediate attention is identifying the most effective strategies to teach current and future clinicians standard approaches to identifying and diagnosing malnutrition. Although a consensus definition will be meaningful, current definitions are directed toward undernourished and adult patients, and clarification and refinement of assessment for obese patients are necessary. Nutrition support clinicians often care for patients who are not yet malnourished but who are at high risk of becoming malnourished during therapy, and improved understanding of this risk may be needed to justify resources in a cost-conscious environment. Prospective cohort studies describing the natural history of at-risk patients and detailing physical symptoms, clinical assessments, laboratory tests, and diagnostic tools for all patient categories would be helpful to address these gaps.

### Enteral nutrition versus parenteral nutrition – the risks and benefits [^112foeuj]. Nature Clinical Practice: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2007). Medium credibility.

The role of nutrition in patient care became a part of mainstream medicine at about the end of the 1960s, with the publication of several papers that showed a benefit of nutritional support in the prevention of complications. At that time, the emphasis was on nutrition given by the parenteral route. Since then, a series of studies that compared parenteral nutrition with enteral nutrition have suggested that the enteral route of feeding causes fewer complications than the parenteral route. A careful review of the data shows that nutritional support can increase the risk of complications when given to well-nourished, obese and hyperglycemic patients. The avoidance of overfeeding and hyperglycemia is, therefore, of paramount importance. In this context, enteral nutrition, for which gastrointestinal tolerance limits overfeeding, can protect the patient.

### Dietary management of blood glucose in medical critically ill overweight and obese patients: an open-label randomized trial [^115XHTZ6]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Enteral nutrition (EN) increases hyperglycemia due to high carbohydrate concentrations while providing insufficient protein. The study tested whether an EN formula with very high-protein- and low-carbohydrate-facilitated glucose control delivered higher protein concentrations within a hypocaloric protocol.

Methods

This was a multicenter, randomized, open-label clinical trial with parallel design in overweight/obese mechanically ventilated critically ill patients prescribed 1.5 g protein/kg ideal body weight/day. Patients received either an experimental very high-protein (37%) and low-carbohydrate (29%) or control high-protein (25%) and conventional-carbohydrate (45%) EN formula.

Results

A prespecified interim analysis was performed after enrollment of 105 patients (52 experimental, 53 control). Protein and energy delivery for controls and experimental groups on days 1–5 were 1.2 ± 0.4 and 1.1 ± 0.3 g/kg ideal body weight/day (P = 0.83), and 18.2 ± 6.0 and 12.5 ± 3.7 kcals/kg ideal body weight/day (P < .0001), respectively. The combined rate of glucose events outside the range of > 110 and ≤ 150 mg/dL were not different (P = 0.54, primary endpoint); thereby the trial was terminated. The mean blood glucose for the control and the experimental groups were 138 (-SD 108, +SD 177) and 126 (-SD 99, +SD 160) mg/dL (P = 0.004), respectively. Mean rate of glucose events > 150 mg/dL decreased (Δ = -13%, P = 0.015), whereas that of 80–110 mg/dL increased (Δ = 14%, P = 0.0007). Insulin administration decreased 10.9% (95% CI, -22% to 0.1%; p = 0.048) in the experimental group relative to the controls. Glycemic events ≤ 80 mg/dL and rescue dextrose use were not different (P = 0.23 and P = 0.53).

Conclusions

A very high-protein and low-carbohydrate EN formula in a hypocaloric protocol reduces hyperglycemic events and insulin requirements while increasing glycemic events between 80–110 mg/dL.

### Guidelines for the provision of nutrition support therapy in the adult critically ill patient: the American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition [^1125vnep]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2022). High credibility.

Question 2 — protein intake level in adult critically ill patients: Across three trials with data from 637 patients, higher versus lower protein intake showed no difference in intensive care unit (ICU) mortality (RD = −0.01; 95% CI, −0.06 to 0.04; P = 0.81) and no difference in hospital mortality (RD = −0.02; 95% CI, −0.07 to 0.04). Given underpowered mortality data and indirectness, the evidence quality was rated low and the recommendation received a strength rating of weak. The 2016 ASPEN-SCCM guideline recommended a protein dose of 1.2–2 g/kg/day for most critically ill patients with higher amounts for burns, obesity, or trauma.

### (mal) nutrition in critical illness and beyond: a narrative review [^114WDc6t]. Anaesthesia (2023). Medium credibility.

Close liaison with ICU-trained dietitians and early initiation of nutrition is a fundamental principle of care of critically ill patients- this should be done while monitoring closely for refeeding syndrome. Enteral nutrition delivered by volumetric pumps should be used where possible, though parenteral nutrition should be started early in patients with high nutritional risk factors. Malnutrition and loss of muscle mass are common in patients who are admitted to ICUs and are prognostic for patient-centred outcomes including complications and mortality. Obesity is part of that story, and isocaloric and high-protein provision of nutrition is important in this group of patients who comprise a growing proportion of people treated. Assessing protein stores and appropriate dosing is, however, challenging in all groups of patients. It would be beneficial to develop strategies to reduce muscle wasting as well; various strategies including amino acid supplementation, ketogenic nutrition and exercise have been trialled, but the quality of data has been inadequate to address this phenomenon. Nutritional targets are rarely achieved in practice, and all ICUs should incorporate clear guidelines to help address this. These should include local nutritional and fasting guidelines and for the management of feed intolerance, early access to post-pyloric feeding and a multidisciplinary framework to support the importance of nutritional education.

### A randomized trial of supplemental parenteral nutrition in underweight and overweight critically ill patients: the TOP-UP pilot trial [^114w5cuG]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Worldwide, there is considerable controversy about the optimal amount and feeding route in critically ill patients. Nutrition practice guidelines in Europe, Canada, and the United States endorse enteral nutrition (EN) for patients who are critically ill and hemodynamically stable. To evaluate the success of EN delivery in the intensive care unit (ICU), a recent observational cohort study of nutrition practices in 167 ICUs across 21 countries was conducted to evaluate worldwide nutrition practices in 2772 patients. Despite multiple international guidelines recommending early initiation of EN in the ICU, the data revealed practitioners are only successfully delivering approximately 50% of prescribed daily calories from EN over the first 12 days in the ICU. In addition, in some developed countries like the United States, it takes an average of > 60 hours to initiate EN.

Because of this consistent and longstanding failure to deliver prescribed EN, parenteral nutrition (PN) has been utilized in up to 35–70% of critically ill patients. However, current guidelines do not agree on when to initiate PN in the ICU. For patients who are intolerant to or have other contraindications to EN, European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism (ESPEN) guidelines recommend initiating PN within 24–48 hours in patients not expected to receive full oral nutrition within 3 days, and initiating supplemental PN (SPN) if EN levels are not at goal in 48 hours. New US (American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition [ASPEN]/Society of Critical Care Medicine [SCCM]) guidelines hesitate to recommend early PN in the ICU, with PN initiation advised only after 7 days in well-nourished patients. Although, in patients found to be significantly malnourished via nutrition risk scores (i.e. Nutrition Risk in Critically Ill [NUTRIC] score [without IL-6] ≥ 5 or Nutrition Risk Score [NRS] ≥ 5), total PN is recommended to start at ICU admission.

### Nutritional support [^1162ZMGB]. Chest Surgery Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

Despite the increasing obesity of the American population, many chronically ill patients are malnourished. When this malnutrition is combined with the hypermetabolic response and protein catabolism of an acute event, such as an operation, nutritional support becomes an important facet for optimal critical care. This chapter reviews the basic tenants of nutritional support with special emphasis on patients with pulmonary compromise. Important aspects of caloric and protein support are discussed and enteral nutrition is emphasized because of its numerous advantages and documented improvement in outcome.

### Obesity and critical care nutrition: current practice gaps and directions for future research [^114CwVc1]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

This review has been developed following a panel discussion with an international group of experts in the care of patients with obesity in the critical care setting and focuses on current best practices in malnutrition screening and assessment, estimation of energy needs for patients with obesity, the risks and management of sarcopenic obesity, the value of tailored nutrition recommendations, and the emerging role of immunonutrition. Patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) increasingly present with overweight and obesity that require individualized nutrition considerations due to underlying comorbidities, immunological factors such as inflammation, and changes in energy expenditure and other aspects of metabolism. While research continues to accumulate, important knowledge gaps persist in recognizing and managing the complex nutritional needs in ICU patients with obesity. Available malnutrition screening and assessment tools are limited in patients with obesity due to a lack of validation and heterogeneous factors impacting nutrition status in this population. Estimations of energy and protein demands are also complex in patients with obesity and may include estimations based upon ideal, actual, or adjusted body weight. Evidence is still sparse on the role of immunonutrition in patients with obesity, but the presence of inflammation that impacts immune function may suggest a role for these nutrients in hemodynamically stable ICU patients. Educational efforts are needed for all clinicians who care for complex cases of critically ill patients with obesity, with a focus on strategies for optimal nutrition and the consideration of issues such as weight stigma and bias impacting the delivery of care.

Conclusions

Current nutritional strategies for these patients should be undertaken with a focus on individualized care that considers the whole person, including the possibility of preexisting comorbidities, altered metabolism, and chronic stigma, which may impact the provision of nutritional care. Additional research should focus on the applicability of current guidelines and evidence for nutrition therapy in populations with obesity, especially in the setting of critical illness.

Conclusion

We demonstrated that repeated bolus nutrient administration for up to 2 weeks at a time via a novel, intraorally anchored enteral feeding tube is feasible.

### Enteral nutrition… [^112EGv9d]. JAMA Network (2019). Excellent credibility.

Good nutrition is essential to growth, healing, and vitality. The body requires specific amounts of carbohydrates, protein, fat, vitamins, and minerals depending on body weight and other considerations. For a variety of reasons, some patients are not able to eat. To receive essential nutrients, such patients require means that do not involve chewing or swallowing. Adequate hydration must be provided, but many patients can be without nutrition for up to 7 days. However, depending on the circumstances, nutrition might need to be started sooner. Inability to eat may be temporary, but in some patients it may be a permanent condition. Short-term Nutrition The preferred means of nutrition, enteral nutrition, is through the gut. It is the most natural way in which nutrients are absorbed, allowing the intestines to do their job, and is safer than intravenous nutrition, which is delivered into the bloodstream. The preferred route for enteral nutrition is through the stomach.

A very thin plastic tube can be inserted into a nostril and pushed all the way into the stomach. Liquid nutrition can be given this way at a continuous, set rate or intermittently. Occasionally, a nasojejunal tube is placed instead. This tube is inserted into the part of the small bowel called the jejunum. This can be done for a variety of reasons, including a condition called gastroparesis, in which the stomach is not working but the rest of the intestine is. The pylorus is the valve that separates the stomach from the rest of the small bowel. Therefore, nasojejunal tubes are also referred to as postpyloric tubes. Long-term Nutrition If patients are expected to require enteral nutrition for longer than a couple of weeks, a long-term solution is needed. This may involve use of tubes that go directly through the abdominal wall into the gut. A gastrostomy tube or a jejunostomy tube can be placed into the stomach or the jejunum, respectively.

There are 3 main ways to place these tubes: surgically by a surgeon using general anesthesia; fluoroscopically via x-ray guidance by a radiologist using sedation; or endoscopically by a gastroenterologist or a surgeon using sedation.

Obese ICU patients — feeding strategy recommendation: Based on expert consensus, we suggest that high-protein hypocaloric feeding be implemented in the care of obese ICU patients to preserve lean body mass, mobilize adipose stores, and minimize the metabolic complications of overfeeding. Use of high-protein hypocaloric feeding in hospitalized patients with obesity is associated with at least equivalent (and possible better) outcomes as use of high-protein eucaloric feeding, including a retrospective study of 40 obese critically ill surgical and trauma patients in which high-protein hypocaloric enteral nutrition (EN) was associated with shorter ICU stay, decreased duration of antibiotics, and fewer days of mechanical ventilation compared with a high-protein eucaloric diet; in 1 of 2 RCTs, parenteral high-protein hypocaloric diet resulted in similar outcomes (hospital length of stay [LOS] and mortality) as a high-protein eucaloric parenteral nutrition (PN) regimen, and multiple observational trials have shown equivalent nutrition outcomes and nitrogen balance; low intake of protein in combination with a hypocaloric diet may worsen mortality in obese patients with class II obesity (BMI, 35–39.9).

### Nutrition delivery for obese ICU patients: delivery issues, lack of guidelines, and missed opportunities [^1114eRUv]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2011). Low credibility.

The most appropriate enteral formula for the severely obese population has yet to be determined. The obese patient in the intensive care unit (ICU) creates numerous difficulties for managing care, one being the ability to deliver appropriate and timely nutrition. Access for nutrition therapy, either enteral or parenteral, can also create a challenge. Currently, no specific guidelines are available on a national or international scale to address the issues of how and when to feed the obese patient in the ICU. A bias against feeding these patients exists, secondary to the perception that an enormous quantity of calories is stored in adipose tissue. Making a specialty enteral formula for obesity from existing commercial formulas and other modular nutrient components is not practical, secondary to difficulty with solubility issues, dilution of the formula, and safety concerns. Using today's concepts and current metabolic data, a formula could be produced that would address many of the specific metabolic derangements noted in obesity. This formula should have a high-protein, low-carbohydrate content with at least a portion of the lipid source coming from fish oil. Specific nutrients that may be beneficial in obesity include arginine, glutamine, leucine, L-carnitine, lipoic acid, S-adenosylmethionine, and betaine. Certain trace minerals such as magnesium, zinc, and selenium may also be of value in the obese population. The concept of a specific bariatric formulation for the ICU setting is theoretically sound, is scientifically based, and could be delivered to patients safely.

### Reply to Peçanha antonio: too many calories for all? [^113piwXH]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

From the Authors:

Dr. Peçanha Antonio and colleagues write that administration of at least 70% of estimated energy requirements to critically ill patients provides a survival advantage. However, randomized clinical trials are the gold-standard method for drawing causal inferences about therapies, and there is evidence from three well-conducted multicenter randomized trials involving 1,000, 894, and 3,957 patients, respectively, that mortality is unaffected by targeting a specific energy delivery during the acute phase of critical illness.

The letter also raises concerns that our study compared "overfeeding" with usual feeding practice, particularly given the proportion of patients with obesity in our cohort. The body mass index of our study participants (29.2 kg/m²) reflects the adult body mass index in our region. Those assigned the energy-dense formula received a mean (SD) of 29.1 (6.2) kcal/kg of ideal body weight/d and 23.2 (7.1) kcal/kg of actual body weight/d from the enteral route (see Table E4 in the online supplement of Ref.). We are not aware of any published data establishing that this dose of energy delivered via the enteral route represents overfeeding and/or is a risk factor for increased death. Moreover, for our primary outcome (Day 90 mortality), body mass index was a predefined subgroup of interest, and the relative risk of death (energy-dense formula vs. standard nutrition for the 1,423 participants with a body mass index ≥ 30 kg/m²) was 0.94 (95% confidence interval, 0.77–1.14). Finally, as there is no consensus definition for overfeeding or how to diagnose it, the belief that it has occurred in the subgroup with obesity is speculative at best.

The time could not be riper for the field of nutrition as it moves into the forefront being recognized as a major influencer in the prevention and management of many diseases. The approach to nutrition support therapy, which includes oral diet and enteral and parenteral nutrition, has historically involved approaching patients in the same "one size fits all" manner. However, as research methodologies have advanced over the past decade, data suggest that although people may be grouped into having a particular disease or condition, their nutrition therapeutic intervention may be optimized if it is personalized. This thought-provoking session will discuss current dietary guidelines and provide evidence and pose opportunities toward a future direction incorporating a personalized therapeutic nutrition support approach, which takes into consideration the metabolic capacity of the gut microbiome.

### Obesity and critical care nutrition: current practice gaps and directions for future research [^116P7HEz]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Clinical considerations

Like other aspects of nutritional management in critically ill patients with obesity, clinicians should consider an individualized approach to nutritional management that achieves a higher protein intake without overfeeding energy. While fewer calories are appropriate, a high-protein nutrition regimen may be preferred for many critically ill patients with obesity. While debate ensues regarding the duration and ideal protein delivery during hypocaloric feeding, a target of 2 to 2.5 g/kg ideal body weight per day is considered reasonable in critically ill patients with obesity. While all calculations of ideal body weight have certain limitations, the Hamwi formula may be used in this setting. Monitoring patients for adequate protein is another area of controversy and challenges, especially if a 24-h urine collection is required for nitrogen balance analysis. Limited data are available on proper interpretation of nitrogen balance results, and it is still unclear how these findings correlate with clinical outcomes.

Nutrition strategies for patients with obesity in the ICU

Considering previously discussed nutrition requirements in the critical care setting for all patients, including those with obesity, and understanding the importance of avoiding overfeeding, a tailored approach with fewer calories and more protein seems reasonable. Although data are currently limited and only available from small study populations, hypocaloric, high-protein nutrition therapy has been found to decrease net protein catabolism in hospitalized and critically ill patients with obesity. One such study indicated improved clinical outcomes with hypocaloric high-protein feeding compared to eucaloric feeding; however, other studies indicated no difference. More recently, the augmented versus routine approach to giving energy trial (TARGET) evaluated energy provision of 1.0 kcal/mL versus 1.5 kcal/mL in 3957 patients in the setting of critical illness. There was no significant difference in all-cause mortality at 90 days, infectious complications, or adverse events in the overall study group or in the subgroup with obesity. However, interpretation of these data is tempered, as both groups potentially may have received inadequate protein intakes (~ 1.1 g/kg ideal body weight or ~ 0.8 g/kg actual weight daily).

Anabolic resistance, as assessed by nitrogen balance or whole-body protein dynamics using isotopes, associated with aging can be overcome with sufficient protein intake during critical illness even during hypocaloric energy intake for critically ill older patients with obesity. The extent of obesity also appears to influence the amount of protein required as those patients with class III obesity needed more protein to achieve an equivalent nitrogen balance compared to those with class I and II obesity.

Current guidelines

Based on this and other evidence, 2016 guidelines from ASPEN/SCCM suggest fewer calories and a high-protein diet for patients with obesity. Specifically, based on expert consensus, the guidelines state, "if available, an enteral formula with low caloric density and a reduced NPC:N [nonprotein calorie:nitrogen ratio] be used in the adult obese ICU patient".

Preoperative nutrition

Prior to hepatic surgery, a nutritional risk screening is required to determine patients at higher risk of postoperative complications. Numerous nutritional screening tools have been validated. Multiple meta-analyses have prognosticated nutritional scoring systems utilizing a combination of serum albumin and lymphocyte count (prognostic nutritional index) and, in addition, serum cholesterol (controlling nutritional status score) in patients undergoing hepatectomy for HCC.

Delaying surgery to optimize preoperative malnutrition (body mass index, BMI < 18.5 kg/m²) and disease-related malnutrition (weight loss > 10% or > 5% over 3 months and reduced BMI or a low fat-free mass index) is necessary. A number of adverse outcomes have been associated with poor perioperative nutrition, including septic complications. Perioperative enteral nutritional therapy should be utilized for a period of 7–14 days in such patients, preferably in an outpatient setting. Parenteral nutrition should only be considered in patients where requirements cannot be met by enteral nutrition alone. A single RCT has demonstrated that intraoperative blood loss can be minimized in obese patients undergoing hepatectomy by introducing a low-fat, low-calorie diet one week prior to surgery.

Summary and recommendation: A nutritional assessment is necessary prior to all hepatic surgery. Malnourished patients (i.e. weight loss > 10% or > 5% over 3 months and reduced body mass index or a low fat-free mass index) should be optimized with enteral supplementation at least 7–14 days prior to surgery.

Evidence level: High.

Grade of recommendation: Strong.

### Metabolic support in the critically ill: a consensus of 19 [^11336tiA]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Question 7: Is permissive underfeeding relevant?

Hypocaloric or permissive underfeeding is defined as providing < 40–60% of the calories required for daily energy expenditure. Existing RCTs show no effect of permissive underfeeding on mortality, with inconsistent effects on functional outcomes, but also no harm. Trickle or trophic feeding is defined as providing 20 kcal/h up to 500 kcal/day via the enteral route. There may be benefits of using trophic or minimal enteral feeding, including intestinal epithelium preservation, amplified brush border enzyme secretion, augmented immune function, preservation of epithelial tight cell junctions, and limited bacterial translocation. However, recent large RCTs in the field do not favor enteral over parenteral nutrition (CALORIES, NUTRIREA-2) or high over moderate caloric intake (TARGET) in terms of mortality endpoints. Notably, none of these studies measured energy expenditure to establish caloric targets.

As the prevalence of obesity increases around the world, better understanding of appropriate nutrition therapy in obese critically ill patients is crucial. Obese patients appear to be different to lean patients, with many studies repeatedly suggesting better survival, although the reasons for this "obesity paradox" are not well understood. Adjustment for nutrition status abrogates the improved survival association seen in obese patients, and obese patients with malnutrition do not have a survival advantage. Existing literature regarding the proposed strategy of hypocaloric (permissive), high-protein feeding in obese patients is not well substantiated by methodologically sound and adequately powered trials.

### ACG clinical guideline: nutrition therapy in the adult hospitalized patient [^111LnqAL]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2016). Medium credibility.

Enteral nutrition (EN) initiation in hospitalized adults should occur in patients at high nutritional risk unable to maintain volitional intake within 24–48h of admission to the hospital, with early EN initiated within 24–48h and, when tolerated, feeding advanced to goal within 48–72h; with reduced tolerance, advance with caution to goal by 5 to 7 days. Permissive underfeeding is an acceptable alternative to full feeding and may be considered for acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome, obesity with BMI > 30, and placement on PN over the first week of nutrition therapy. For formula selection, a standard polymeric formula or a high-protein standard formula should be used routinely, an immune-modulating formula containing arginine and omega-3 fish oil should be used for patients who have had major surgery and are in a surgical ICU setting, and it should not be used routinely in a medical ICU.

While research continues to accumulate, important knowledge gaps persist in recognizing and managing the complex nutritional needs in ICU patients with obesity. This paper is the result of an international advisory board consisting of experts in obesity care in the ICU working to address these gaps from dietitian, physician, pharmacist, and nursing perspectives. The advisory board aimed to identify key knowledge gaps, challenges, clinical considerations, and outstanding questions when providing optimal nutritional care for critically ill patients with obesity. Consequently, this review will focus on current best practices in malnutrition screening and assessment, estimation of energy and protein needs, the risks and management of sarcopenic obesity, the value of tailored nutrition recommendations, and the emerging role of immunonutrition for patients with obesity.

Pediatric critically ill — malnutrition impact and assessment: Malnutrition, including obesity, is associated with adverse clinical outcomes, including longer periods of ventilation, higher risk of hospital-acquired infection, longer PICU and hospital stay, and increased mortality; therefore, we recommend that patients in the PICU undergo detailed nutrition assessment within 48 h of admission, and we suggest that the nutrition status of patients be reevaluated at least weekly throughout hospitalization (Quality of evidence: very low; GRADE recommendation: strong).

### Decisions to be made when initiating enteral nutrition [^112rFWnw]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

Enteral nutrition support is preferred to parenteral or no nutritional support, but many patients who could benefit receive inadequate enteral feeding. Many decisions must be made before initiating enteral nutrition support; including if and when enteral nutrition should be started, which formula should be used, and how enteral nutrition support should be monitored. The gastroenterologist should be able to understand and evaluate these decisions in all patients potentially requiring nutritional support.

If these tools are unavailable, the progressive delivery of 1.3 g/kg of protein per day based on adjusted body weight is recommended. Likewise, the 2013 ASPEN guidelines suggest beginning with 1.2 g protein/kg actual weight, or 2–2.5 g/kg ideal body weight of protein for patients who are overweight or have obesity, with adjustments based on results of nitrogen balance studies. The 2016 ASPEN/SCCM obesity guidelines suggest 2 g protein/kg ideal body weight for patients with BMI of 30–40 kg/m² and up to 2.5 g/kg ideal body weight for those with a BMI ≥ 40 kg/m².

Muscle protein synthesis following protein administration is blunted in critical illness. However, indirect evidence, using nitrogen balance determinations, indicates that this anabolic resistance can be mediated by increasing protein intake in critically ill trauma patients with or without obesity. Current guidelines reflect evidence that higher levels of protein delivery have been associated with positive patient outcomes in retrospective and prospective observational studies and small randomized controlled trials, which have not been definitively determined in adequately sized randomized controlled trials. One prospective cohort study in mechanically ventilated critically ill patients (mean BMI: 26 ± 6 kg/m²) found that optimal nutritional therapy, including adequate protein and energy delivery, was associated with a 50% decrease in 28-day mortality. Adequate energy delivery without meeting protein targets, however, was not associated with mortality risk. In another study of 1,171 critically ill patients with a mean BMI of 28 kg/m², increased protein intake was associated with a modest reduction in mortality risk. Thus, higher protein delivery, which may be achieved with the use of high protein formula or protein modular supplements, may be preferred. For instance, a double-blind, randomized trial found that a very high-protein enteral formula (32% kcals from protein) compared to a conventional, standard high-protein content formula (20% kcals from protein) demonstrated the ability to deliver adequate protein requirements without increased energy intake in critically ill patients who were overweight.

### A randomized trial of supplemental parenteral nutrition in underweight and overweight critically ill patients: the TOP-UP pilot trial [^116TaqbT]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Nutrition guidelines recommendations differ on the use of parenteral nutrition (PN), and existing clinical trial data are inconclusive. Our recent observational data show that amounts of energy/protein received early in the intensive care unit (ICU) affect patient mortality, particularly for inadequate nutrition intake in patients with body mass indices (BMIs) of < 25 or > 35. Thus, we hypothesized increased nutrition delivery via supplemental PN (SPN) + enteral nutrition (EN) to underweight and obese ICU patients would improve 60-day survival and quality of life (QoL) versus usual care (EN alone).

Methods

In this multicenter, randomized, controlled pilot trial completed in 11 centers across four countries, adult ICU patients with acute respiratory failure expected to require mechanical ventilation for > 72 hours and with a BMI of < 25 or ≥ 35 were randomized to receive EN alone or SPN + EN to reach 100% of their prescribed nutrition goal for 7 days after randomization. The primary aim of this pilot trial was to achieve a 30% improvement in nutrition delivery.

Results

In total, 125 patients were enrolled. Over the first 7 post-randomization ICU days, patients in the SPN + EN arm had a 26% increase in delivered calories and protein, whereas patients in the EN-alone arm had a 22% increase (both p < 0.001). Surgical ICU patients received poorer EN nutrition delivery and had a significantly greater increase in calorie and protein delivery when receiving SPN versus medical ICU patients. SPN proved feasible to deliver with our prescribed protocol. In this pilot trial, no significant outcome differences were observed between groups, including no difference in infection risk. Potential, although statistically insignificant, trends of reduced hospital mortality and improved discharge functional outcomes and QoL outcomes in the SPN + EN group versus the EN-alone group were observed.

Conclusions

Provision of SPN + EN significantly increased calorie/protein delivery over the first week of ICU residence versus EN alone. This was achieved with no increased infection risk. Given feasibility and consistent encouraging trends in hospital mortality, QoL, and functional endpoints, a full-scale trial of SPN powered to assess these clinical outcome endpoints in high-nutritional-risk ICU patients is indicated — potentially focusing on the more poorly EN-fed surgical ICU setting.

### Measured energy expenditure compared with best-practice recommendations for obese, critically ill patients – A prospective observational study [^114QZ4MT]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

This study aimed to compare recommendations in the American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (ASPEN) Guidelines for the Provision and Assessment of Nutrition Support Therapy in the Adult Critically Ill Patient with measured energy expenditure in obese, critically ill adults.

Methods

After enrollment, measured energy expenditure was attempted at baseline and twice weekly to extubation or day 14. Data are reported as median [interquartile range].

Results

Twenty patients were included. The median baseline and subsequent measured energy expenditures were 2438 [1807–2703] kcal and 2919 [2318–3362] kcal, respectively. Baseline measured energy expenditures were -491 [-788 to -323] kcal lower than subsequent measurements, and week 1 measurements were lower than those of week 2. The median bias between the guideline recommendation of 11–14 kcal/kg of actual body weight and measured expenditure at baseline was -950 [-1254 to -595] kcal/d and -1618 [-1820 to -866] kcal/d at subsequent measurements.

Conclusion

Clinically significant variation was observed between measured expenditure and guideline recommendations at all time points.

### Obesity and critical care nutrition: current practice gaps and directions for future research [^117PsH4w]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Traditional diagnostic assessment tools like body mass index (BMI) may fail to exhibit linear patterns between individual BMI determinations and cardiometabolic health status or associated risk in critical illness. Although controversial, current research describes a J-shaped relationship between BMI and mortality risk in critical illness, suggesting that patients who are overweight or who have moderate obesity have a lower mortality risk than those with a normal range BMI or severe obesity. These findings, termed the obesity paradox, may be subject to selection bias related to the possibility that some of these individuals may have had a better nutrition status than those with a low BMI. The data suggest that more precise measures of body composition and nutrition status may offer greater insight when determining individual morbidity risks, especially during critical illness.

Guidelines are available for the nutrition care of critically ill patients with obesity, but underlying research in this area is limited. Societies such as the American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (ASPEN), the Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM), and the European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism (ESPEN) have published recommendations for this population and often recommend an individualized approach to most aspects of nutritional care in patients with obesity (Table 1). A recently published update to the 2016 ASPEN/SCCM guidelines evaluated five questions central to nutritional therapy for all critical care patients. The guidelines did not specify recommendations for patients with obesity and instead, concluded that clinical judgment and close monitoring continue to be needed in the absence of consistent evidence. Practitioners should also consider that a variety of factors can complicate the delivery of optimal nutritional care to patients with obesity. These patients may present with altered nutrient processing and pharmacokinetics, especially in the critical care setting, which potentially complicates both medication delivery and nutritional management efforts. A summary of potential factors complicating the care of patients with obesity in critical illness is illustrated in Fig. 1.

### Early enteral nutrition prevent acute pancreatitis from deteriorating in obese patients [^112HuUvZ]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Goals

The aim of this study was to determine a potential strategy to prevent acute pancreatitis (AP) from deteriorating in obese patients.

Background

Nutritional support plays a critical role in the treatment of AP. Early enteral nutrition (EEN) is considered to be able to protect mucosa of AP patients and alleviate inflammatory reactions. Obesity worsen AP prognosis. However, little is known about the effects of EEN in obese patients.

Study

Prospective randomized control trial. Subjects with moderately severe AP or severe AP were divided into the visceral fat obesity (VFO) group and the non-VFO group by obesity index VFO. The patients received "delayed" enteral nutrition (started enteral nutrition feeding after the first 48 hours after admission to the hospital: group A: patients of non-VFO, n = 108; group B: VFO patients, n = 88) or EEN (in the VFO subgroup, group C: n = 91). Occurrence of complication, clinical outcomes, plasma levels of cytokines, and intestine gut barrier index were measured at different timepoints after admission.

Results

VFO was a risk factor for aggravating of AP. EEN prevented the VFO patients from developing pancreatic necrotic infection, the mechanism of which might be related with inhibiting excessive inflammatory reactions, adjusting the imbalance of inflammatory response, and alleviating ischemia of intestine mucosa.

Conclusions

The potential strategy, EEN, was able to prevent AP from deteriorating in obese patients.

A.S.P.E.N. clinical guideline — nutrition support of hospitalized adult patients with obesity outlines its purpose, methodology, key questions, and prevalence context. The guideline states its purpose is "to serve as a framework for the nutrition support care of adult patients with obesity", was based on "a systematic review… evaluated using concepts adopted from the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation working group", and used "a consensus process… prior to multiple levels of external and internal review and approval by the A.S.P.E.N. Board of Directors". Background epidemiology reports U.S. prevalence "is 35.5% in adult men, 35.8% in adult women, including 4.4% and 2.8% respectively with body mass index (BMI) ≥ 40 kg/m²", and notes "the American Medical Association recognized obesity as a disease that requires medical treatment". Key questions include whether "clinical outcomes vary across levels of obesity in critically ill or hospitalized non-intensive care unit (ICU) patients", how to determine energy requirements in obese inpatients, whether hypocaloric, high protein diets improve clinical outcomes, and which micronutrients to evaluate after malabsorptive or restrictive surgery.

### When is enteral nutrition indicated? [^111jtNwD]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2022). Medium credibility.

Enteral nutrition (EN) is a vital component of nutrition around the world. EN allows for delivery of nutrients to those who cannot maintain adequate nutrition by oral intake alone. Common questions regarding EN are when to initiate and in what scenarios it is safe. The answers to these questions are often complex and require an evidence-based approach. The Board of Directors of the American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (ASPEN) established an Enteral Nutrition Committtee to address the important questions surrounding the indications for EN. Consensus recommendations were established based on eight extremely clinically relevant questions regarding EN indications as deemed by the Enteral Nutrition Committee. These consensus recommendations may act as a guide for clinicians and stakeholders on difficult questions pertaining to indications for EN. This paper was approved by the ASPEN Board of Directors.

Current guidelines on energy provision

The 2013 ASPEN obesity guidelines suggest that if indirect calorimetry is unavailable, energy requirements should be based on the Penn State University 2010 predictive equation, or the modified Penn State equation if the patient is over the age of 60 years. The 2016 ASPEN/SCCM guidelines echoed the preference for indirect calorimetry and stated that, if unavailable, a simple weight-based equation be used. Specifically, these guidelines suggest that enteral nutrition be provided within 24–48 h of admission to patients with obesity and suggest an energy provision of 11–14 kcal/kg actual body weight for individuals with a BMI of 30–50 kg/m² and 22–25 kcal/kg ideal body weight for individuals with a BMI greater than 50 kg/m². In 2019, ESPEN released guidelines suggesting clinicians add 20%–25% of the difference in actual body weight minus ideal body weight added to ideal body weight when calculating energy requirements for patients with obesity as estimating caloric intake on ideal body weight may underestimate energy expenditure for those with obesity. It should be noted that all available guidelines are based on a low quality of evidence, and none contemplate which ideal body weight calculation to use. The current ESPEN guidelines, for instance, discuss three different methods for calculating ideal body weight, with no consensus for clinicians on which might be optimal for their patients.

In the absence of consistent guidelines to estimate energy needs for these patients, clinicians should use an individualized approach that considers current guidelines, the amount of metabolically active tissue the patient may have (which will influence the degree of hypermetabolism) and the need to respond to changing nutritional requirements and metabolic aberrations throughout the course of care. Patients should be closely monitored, and nutrition regimens should be adjusted accordingly for outcomes such as hyperglycemia, hypercapnia, and other metabolic disturbances.

### Nutrition therapy in critical illness: a review of the literature for clinicians [^117TDqRq]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Obese

The unique and complex care needs of obese patients (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m²) are amplified when they become critically ill and include a greater risk of insulin resistance and loss of lean muscle mass, and wide variations in macronutrient metabolism, which makes nutrition management complex. There is currently very limited, low-quality evidence to inform nutrition provision in the critically ill obese patient, and as a result, the latest clinical guidelines provide inconsistent recommendations regarding energy and protein targets (Table 1).

In the TARGET trial, 1423 obese critically ill patients were included, representing the largest population of obese patients in an ICU nutrition study. While not statistically significant, the obese subgroup was the only pre-specified subgroup where the point estimate sat on the side of benefit with greater energy delivery. These results require formal evaluation in a robust, adequately powered and blinded clinical trial; however, they highlight that obese patients may respond differently to nutrition delivery than non-obese individuals and that there is a critical need for further research in this patient group.

In the absence of definitive evidence of the impact on functional recovery in particular, it is the opinion of the authors that obese patients should be managed like any other patient admitted to the ICU. If predictive equation estimates are used, a method to adjust body weight should be used in the nutrition prescriptions (not actual weight), and delivery monitored carefully with the knowledge that most predictive equations significantly underestimate requirements in this group. It may be appropriate to consider a weight loss regime in the recovery phase once the acute illness has resolved.

The non-ventilated patient

Critically ill patients who are not intubated may have prolonged periods of inadequate oral intake. In a prospective observational study, 50 patients who were not receiving any EN or PN were studied for 7 days following endotracheal extubation. The average daily energy and protein intake failed to exceed 50% of daily requirements on all 7 days for the entire population. To prevent malnutrition, it is important that clinicians monitor the oral intake of awake patients and the authors support the ESPEN guideline recommendation that medical nutrition therapy should be considered for all patients staying in the ICU for > 2 days regardless of their ventilation status.

### When is parenteral nutrition appropriate? [^1162swmp]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2017). Medium credibility.

Parenteral nutrition — patient and disease-focused research priorities: It remains unknown how long a patient can withstand an absence of nutrient intake before detrimental clinical effects may ensue, and future research should address the time course when nutrition support therapy should be initiated to prevent adverse clinical outcomes. The optimal timing of PN provision soon after birth in more mature preterm infants and strategies in improving their clinical outcomes require further investigation, and well-designed prospective research to address the optimal timing to initiate PN therapy in pediatric patients when enteral nutrition (EN) is not feasible should be conducted. With the increased provision of protein energy, especially in obese critically ill patients, concerns exist regarding the safest maximum dose of parenteral amino acids; research should assess short-term and long-term benefit of PN with high amino acid provision, evaluate nitrogen balance or amino acid utilization if possible, and carefully evaluate safety, patient tolerability, and cost-effectiveness, preferably in prospective clinical trials. The impact of optimal serum glucose control, protection of the vascular access device, and attention to relative distribution of macronutrients on PN safety outcomes need to be explored for adult, pediatric, and neonatal populations. Further research to clearly define the optimal use of PN, including when and strategy to initiate PN, is urgently needed for PN in the acute phase of critical illness, intradialytic PN, home PN in obese patients, PN use in the palliative care setting, PN use in patients receiving chemotherapy, and PN administration in the presence of bacteremia or fungemia not related to the central venous access device (CVAD).

The changes in understanding energy requirements has also prompted a reassessment of the role of protein. Traditional goals for protein delivery are 0.8 g/kg/d, even though in clinical practice patients tend to receive lower amounts than those suggested. 15 A positive nitrogen balance, reflecting an improvement in protein anabolism, is observed by increasing protein loads above 0.8 g/kg/d. 16, 17, 18 Furthermore, observational trials suggest that the provision of at least 1.2 g/kg/d is safe and may be associated with improved clinical outcomes. 19 Although the ideal concentration is yet to be determined, new guidelines suggest that an increase in protein requirements could be beneficial. 2

Most currently available enteral and premade parenteral nutrition formulas were created based on traditional nutrition goals, may be inadequate at meeting new guidelines, and are associated with side effects, including worsening hyperglycemia. We thus hypothesized that a formula containing lower carbohydrate concentrations (providing 29% of total calories) and increased amounts of protein (providing 37% of total calories) would facilitate improved glucose control and avoid worsening of hyperglycemia (> 150 mg/dL) while delivering protein requirements suggested by new guidelines. Herein we report testing this hypothesis in an open‐label multicenter trial focusing on overweight and obese critically ill patients in medical ICUs in multiple centers in the United States and Canada.

### Obesity and critical care nutrition: current practice gaps and directions for future research [^116aDg6y]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Patients with obesity and critical illness present with several clinical challenges due to the possibility of underlying comorbidities, systemic inflammation, and a lack of evidence to routinely guide nutritional management interventions. Considering the challenges in providing optimal care for patients with obesity and the lack of robust evidence, this advisory board's consensus opinion rests on the importance of individual care with the principal of first, do no harm. Overall, current nutritional strategies for these patients should be undertaken with a focus on individualized care that considers the whole person, including the possibility of chronic stigma that could impact the delivery of effective care. Additional research should focus on the applicability of current guidelines and evidence for nutrition therapy in populations with obesity. Future studies should also be undertaken to determine the potential for strategies that better address underlying inflammation and other chronic risks seen in patients with obesity, especially in the setting of critical illness.

Obesity in critical illness — malnutrition prevalence and substrate use: Fifty-seven percent of hospitalized patients with a BMI > 25 show evidence of malnutrition, and patients with a BMI > 30 have an OR of 1.5 for having malnutrition (P = 0.02); in a SICU study, obese subjects derived only 39% of their REE from fat metabolism, compared with 61% in their lean counterparts, and obese ICU patients are more likely than lean subjects to have problems with fuel utilization, which predisposes them to greater loss of lean body mass.

### Current strategies of critical care assessment and therapy of the obese patient (hypocaloric feeding): what are we doing and what do we need to do? [^115W3rn3]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2011). Low credibility.

Two of the most challenging issues in the clinical management of the obese patient are assessing energy requirements and whether hypocaloric (permissive) underfeeding should be employed. Multiple predictive equations have been used in the literature to estimate resting metabolic rate, although no consensus has emerged regarding which prediction equation is most accurate and precise in the obese population. Hypocaloric, or permissive underfeeding, specifically refers to the intentional administration of calories that are less than predicted energy expenditure. Thus far, very few studies performed have been performed to assess the efficacy of hypocaloric feeding in the obese hospitalized patient. It is concluded that the optimal caloric intake of obese patients in the intensive care unit remains unclear given the limitation of the existing data.

The role of immunonutrition and fiber in critically Ill patients with obesity

The excessive visceral fat tissue and adipocyte hypertrophy seen in patients with obesity contributes to a pro-inflammatory environment, including higher levels of hormones like leptin that disrupt T cell function, which results in a suppressed immune response to infection. Immune function may be influenced by nutritional factors such as vitamin D and arginine status, both of which have been reported to be reduced in non-ICU patients with obesity. Beyond arginine and vitamin D, inflammation may be modulated by other dietary factors such as omega-3 fatty acids and fiber; therefore, the use of these immune-modulating nutrients (also known as immunonutrition) has been considered in critically ill patients with obesity who are hemodynamically stable.

The enteric microbiome is integral to the development and function of innate/adaptive immune systems through microbial metabolites and is likewise impacted by leptin and other hormones that are motivated by a pro-inflammatory environment. These same pathways are hypothesized to play an important role in the initial development of obesity as well. Nutrition, including the route of nutrition (enteral versus parenteral) and nutrition components such as soluble fiber, have been shown to alter the gut microbiota. The microbiome is, therefore, being investigated as a target to address inflammation and obesity, with immunonutrition a potential modulating factor in this setting.

Current guidelines

Based on expert opinion or very low to moderate quality of evidence, the 2016 ASPEN/SCCM guidelines suggest immune-modulating formulas with components such as arginine and fish oil in the surgical intensive care unit, for severe trauma patients, and for those with traumatic brain injury. It is not clear if immunonutrition could benefit critically ill patients with obesity who do not have these conditions. The 2016 ASPEN/SCCM guidelines state, "while an exaggerated immune response in obese patients implicates potential benefit from immunomodulating formulas, lack of outcome data precludes a recommendation at this time". Regarding soluble fiber, the 2016 ASPEN/SCCM guidelines suggest "a fermentable soluble fiber additive (e.g. fructooligosaccharides [FOSs], inulin) be considered for routine use in all hemodynamically stable MICU [medical intensive care unit]/SICU [surgical intensive care unit] patients placed on a standard enteral formulation". This guidance is for the general ICU patient and the guidelines do not mention whether fiber provision should differ for patients with obesity.

### Nutrition support in the obese, diabetic patient: the role of hypocaloric feeding [^117DcGQe]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

It has previously been thought that meeting estimated caloric needs with nutrition support improves outcomes in critically ill, obese patients with diabetes. Recent data suggests that intentionally failing to match caloric expenditure may actually result in better outcomes than eucaloric feeding. This review will evaluate recent studies exploring the relationship between caloric intake and outcomes in obese patients with underlying insulin resistance or diabetes.

Recent Findings

Obese patients who receive 33–70% of their estimated caloric needs during critical illness have better clinical outcomes than patients fed eucalorically. The reasons for this are not clear, however, they do not appear to be due to improved glycemic control. It is possible that caloric restriction acts by improving insulin sensitivity in protein and glucose metabolism, reducing the risk of infection without causing severe hypoglycemia. Patients who are unable to achieve goal-feeding rates have poorer clinical outcomes but this is most likely due to severity of illness rather than caloric intake itself.

Summary

It is better to err on the side of hypocaloric nutrition support in obese, diabetic patients rather than overfeeding. Hypocaloric feeding may result in improved outcomes, however, the optimal duration of hypocaloric nutrition support is not known.

Obesity-related risk indicators and outcomes in ICU (intensive care unit) patients are described, highlighting BMI strata, central adiposity, and sarcopenia. While a lower mortality may be seen in the cohort of ICU patients with a BMI between 30–40, those with a BMI > 40 clearly have worse outcome and higher mortality than ICU patients with BMI 30–40. In a study by Paolini et al, the presence of central adiposity and metabolic syndrome was associated with an increased ICU mortality of 44%, compared with lean counterparts in the ICU, with a mortality of 25%. In a trauma study involving 149 SICU patients, 47% of whom were overweight or obese, the presence of sarcopenia was shown to be associated with worsened outcome; mortality increased from 14% to 32%, and there were fewer ICU-free days and ventilator-free days in the presence of sarcopenia compared with those without, and increased abdominal adiposity is associated with insulin resistance, hyperglycemia, and metabolic syndrome and is a risk factor for ICU complications.

EN support may be provided to patients with a functional GI tract who are unable to consume enough food and fluids to meet estimated nutritional needs due to an impaired ability to ingest food, changes in digestion or absorption, or alterations in nutritional requirements. EN support is not appropriate for patients who have severe GI malfunction or are in a hypermetabolic state with poor enteral access. 1 The decision of how to administer EN support depends on multiple factors including gastric motility, gastric aspiration risk, GI anatomy, and the patient's medical condition. Gastric feeding more closely mimics normal intake physiology, is easier to administer, and allows for a larger volume and higher osmotic load than feeding into the small intestine. Postpyloric feeding may be beneficial in patients at high risk of aspiration, severe esophagitis, gastric dysmotility, gastric obstruction, recurrent emesis, or pancreatitis. 22, 23. Delivery of EN support can be accomplished through continuous, intermittent, or bolus feedings. 1 Continuous feedings, given over 12 to 24 hours, or cyclic feedings, given over eight to 16 hours, are generally well tolerated, but require the use of a feeding pump.

Intermittent feedings, given over 20 to 30 minutes, are provided to noncritically ill individuals who may not be able to tolerate bolus feedings. Bolus feedings are indicated for noncritically ill patients with an intact gag reflex and normal gastric function. Bolus feeding mimics normal feeding by providing a large volume of food into the stomach several times throughout the day without the need for a feeding pump. 1 Excessive protein provided in PN support increases the metabolic load on the kidneys; therefore, renal function should be monitored. 27.

### ACG clinical guideline: nutrition therapy in the adult hospitalized patient [^116HN3Ni]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2016). Medium credibility.

ACG nutrition therapy — evidence on early EN timing and caloric delivery — Meta‑analyses comparing early vs delayed EN found that feeds started within the first 24–48 h (average 36h) of admission were associated with reduced infection, hospital LOS, and mortality compared with later starts. In patients at high‑nutritional risk, delivery of ≥ 80% of goal calories was associated with the lowest mortality. In a large multi‑center randomized trial in ARDS/ALI, outcomes were equivalent between trophic feeding at 20 ml/h (providing 25% of requirements) for the first 6 days then advanced to goal and full feeds from admission (providing 80% of caloric requirements at end of study); study patients had an average age of 52 years, BMI of 30, ICU stay of 5 days, and mortality of 10%. For obese, critically ill patients with BMI > 30, a high‑protein, hypocaloric regimen providing 2.0–2.5 g protein/kg ideal body weight per day is described as appropriate.

With the dramatic increase in the prevalence of obesity worldwide and in the United States, it is virtually certain that clinicians will be caring for bariatric and obese nonbariatric patients in increasing numbers. This patient population presents several difficulties from the medical and surgical management perspectives. In particular, nutrition of the bariatric patient and critically ill obese patient is challenging. A clear understanding of the nutritional assessment and unique management strategies available for the bariatric and the critically ill obese patient is essential to provide them with the safest and most effective care.

### Obesity and critical care nutrition: current practice gaps and directions for future research [^114Doa4e]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Clinical considerations

A personalized approach to nutrition is key to delivering adequate protein while reducing the risk of excessive energy provision for critically ill patients with obesity to reduce morbidity and mortality risks. A practical approach to developing this type of nutritional regimen would be the use of high protein, low calorie enteral formulas with the addition of bolus protein supplements if necessary for those require enteral nutrition therapy. For parenteral nutrition, a low dextrose, high amino acid content formula would be prescribed. However, other aspects must be taken into consideration, such as renal and hepatic function. As previously discussed, frequent reassessment of clinical status and nutritional needs is vital in these vulnerable patients.

Current estimations of nutrition status and requirements among obese patients remain unclear, and once obesity is identified, the role of nutrition support is to prevent complications associated with enteral or parenteral feedings. Undernutrition may result in energy and protein deprivation, whereas overzealous nutrition support may result in hypophosphatemia, typically observed in refeeding syndrome, and hyperglycemia; thus, neither undernutrition nor overnutrition can be recommended during hospitalization of the obese child.

Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2023). High credibility.

Registered dietitian nutritionist (RDN) in pediatric gastrointestinal (GI) care — key areas of future research span multiple conditions and outcomes. In nutrition support, priorities include comparison of outcomes for patients with enteral nutrition (EN) or parenteral nutrition (PN) managed by a RDN versus without, and determining the frequency of RDN visits associated with best outcomes for home EN/PN. In malnutrition, proposed measures include time to resolution with and without RDN intervention and hospital length of stay. For intestinal failure, the agenda includes comparing outcomes between centers with and without RDN involvement and assessing cost savings with RDN involvement in an intestinal rehabilitation team (IRT). Additional domains include obesity (frequency of RDN visits most likely to promote success for obesity, NASH/NAFLD, and pre-bariatric surgery), liver disease (comparing growth, serum vitamin/mineral levels, and transplant outcomes with and without RDN), pediatric feeding disorder (time to resolution with and without RDN), inflammatory bowel disease (objective nutrition markers, disease severity, health care costs, and quality of life with RDN intervention), celiac disease (compliance to a gluten-free diet and quality of life with RDN support), EGIDs and other allergic disorders (nutrition risk on elimination diets and pre/post RDN comparisons of intake and compliance), and neurogastroenterology and motility disorders (nutrition risk and low FODMAP diet outcomes with and without RDN assessment/education). Systems-level work includes defining RDN-to-patient ratios for optimal outcomes and conducting prospective studies on micronutrient deficiency management with RDN intervention.

### A.S.P.E.N. clinical guidelines: nutrition support of hospitalized adult patients with obesity [^117MUAR9]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Due to the high prevalence of obesity in adults, nutrition support clinicians are encountering greater numbers of obese patients who require nutrition support during hospitalization. The purpose of this clinical guideline is to serve as a framework for the nutrition support care of adult patients with obesity.

Method

A systematic review of the best available evidence to answer a series of questions regarding management of nutrition support in patients with obesity was undertaken and evaluated using concepts adopted from the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation working group. A consensus process, that includes consideration of the strength of the evidence together with the risks and benefits to the patient, was used to develop the clinical guideline recommendations prior to multiple levels of external and internal review and approval by the A.S.P.E.N. Board of Directors.

Questions

(1) Do clinical outcomes vary across levels of obesity in critically ill or hospitalized non-intensive care unit (ICU) patients? (2) How should energy requirements be determined in obese critically ill or hospitalized non-ICU patients? (3) Are clinical outcomes improved with hypocaloric, high protein diets in hospitalized patients? (4) In obese patients who have had a malabsorptive or restrictive surgical procedure, what micronutrients should be evaluated?

### Too many calories for all? [^112dJ9A4]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

To the Editor:

In a recent paper published in the Journal, Deane and colleagues explored the effects of two different strategies of caloric intake (70% vs. 100%) in critically ill patients undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation. The main hypothesis was that optimal energy delivery, or approximately 100% of recommended caloric intake, impacted long-term mortality, quality of life, returning to work, and disability. The authors stated that no approach was used to estimate individual caloric needs. Instead, study participants were randomly assigned to an energy-dense (1.5 kcal/ml) or to a regular (1.0 kcal/ml) enteral formula with similar protein contents and then received an infusion at a rate of 1 ml/kg/h on the basis of calculated ideal body weight. Accordingly, the mean total energy provided for the intervention and control groups resulted in, respectively, 30.2 and 21.9 kcal/kg of ideal body weight/d or 24.0 and 17.4 kcal/kg of actual body weight/d. Because a sizeable proportion of participants (30%) had obesity and the mean body mass index was 29.2 kg/m², we are concerned that the arms represented overfeeding rather than standard nutrition. Energy supply exceeded recommendations of current nutritional guidelines in the so-called 100%-calorie-requirements group, particularly considering the short median duration of the enteral trial, which was 6 days.

From our standpoint, the aim of a modest goal for caloric intake during the acute phase of critical illness is no longer debatable. An energy target of at least 70% of the estimated requirements still confers a survival advantage, and overfeeding is notably detrimental in critically ill individuals with obesity. So, we disagree that control individuals in the aforementioned trial had been truly underfed. Moreover, a smaller but well-powered study has already addressed physical quality of life at 6 months after ICU admission by comparing two different strategies of energy provision, in which the control group received 64% of the calories administered to the intervention group, and found no superiority for the latter. Therefore, we believe that future trials should investigate whether adequate and individually tailored nutritional management beyond the 5–7 days of an ICU stay leads to better functional outcomes.

Other gastrointestinal diseases — evidence gaps and consensus signals for the registered dietitian nutritionist (RDN) role are outlined, alongside areas with supportive evidence. The page notes many conditions with nutrition risk (for example, protein-losing enteropathy, disaccharidase deficiency, and irritable bowel syndrome) where the review did not identify evidence regarding the role of the RDN, while consensus reports describe the role in pediatric cystic fibrosis; there is evidence to support the role of the RDN in pediatric enteral nutrition (EN) and parenteral nutrition (PN), celiac disease, and pediatric obesity. Expert committees specifically call out nutrition assessment in neurogastroenterology and motility disorders, including cyclic vomiting syndrome and pediatric intestinal pseudo-obstruction; other motility disorders such as gastroparesis and long-segment Hirschsprung disease affect nutrient intake and may present with malnutrition, and these patients may require EN or PN and may benefit from RDN referral.

AASLD Practice Guidance — nutrition in critically ill cirrhosis/ACLF advises multidisciplinary nutrition management, objective assessment at ICU admission, and targeted support using validated tools and goals. An objective assessment of nutrition status and risk should be performed on all ICU admissions, and guidelines recommend use of the Nutrition Risk in the Critically Ill (NUTRIC) score to identify ICU patients who benefit most from early nutrition support. The 2021 AASLD malnutrition guidance recommended a target caloric goal of 35 kcal/kg for patients without obesity with cirrhosis and 25–35 kcal/kg for patients with obesity with a body mass index of 30–40, and protein restriction is not recommended. Enteral nutrition is preferred over parenteral nutrition if no contraindications are present and should be started as soon as possible after resuscitation is complete and the patient is not requiring high-dose vasopressors, though the exact vasopressor level is not known; standard enteral formulas are indicated, there is no benefit of branched-chain amino acid formulas in ICU patients with ACLF, and parenteral nutrition is indicated if contraindications to enteral nutrition (bowel obstruction, ischemic bowel, severe intestinal ileus, and enteral nutrition intolerance) are present.

Bariatric surgery nutrition support — Enteral nutrition (EN) has been used for treatment-refractory dumping syndrome after bariatric surgery and for leaks after SG, and the role for parenteral nutrition (PN) in some patients with OAGB indicates the need for close follow-up similar to other malabsorptive procedures. Clinical Practice Guidelines from the American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition recommend a high-nitrogen diet (1.2 g/kg actual or to 2 to 2.5 g/kg ideal weight of amino acid), low-energy (50 to 70% estimated requirements) formulation, which also avoids overfeeding when indirect calorimetry is absent and formulaic calculations overestimate needs. In a randomized, controlled study of patients undergoing RYGB, pre-operative oral carbohydrate loading and perioperative peripheral PN were safe but not associated with improved body composition or clinical outcomes compared with standard nutritional management. Refeeding syndrome is a potential complication of PN after severe weight loss, especially after RYGB/DS, warranting attention to adequate micronutrition with initial limited nonprotein calories (especially dextrose).

Adult malnutrition (undernutrition) consensus recommendations — The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (Academy) and the American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (A.S.P.E.N.) recommend that a standardized set of diagnostic characteristics be used to identify and document adult malnutrition in routine clinical practice, and an etiologically based diagnostic nomenclature that incorporates a current understanding of the role of the inflammatory response is proposed; universal use of a single set of diagnostic characteristics is stated to facilitate recognition, produce more valid prevalence and incidence estimates, guide interventions, and influence expected outcomes. Malnutrition is described as a nutrition imbalance, with adult malnutrition treated as synonymous with adult undernutrition, which occurs along a continuum of inadequate intake and/or increased requirements, impaired absorption, altered transport, and altered nutrient utilization; even overweight or obese adults with severe acute illness or major trauma are noted to be at risk and may benefit from intensive nutrition intervention. The organizations do not propose any specific inflammatory markers for diagnostic purposes at this time, and malnutrition is noted as a contributor to increased morbidity and mortality, decreased function and quality of life, and increased frequency and length of hospital stay.

### Dietary management of blood glucose in medical critically ill overweight and obese patients: an open-label randomized trial [^1158eMKj]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2019). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background: Enteral nutrition (EN) increases hyperglycemia due to high carbohydrate concentrations while providing insufficient protein. The study tested whether an EN formula with very high‐protein‐ and low‐carbohydrate‐facilitated glucose control delivered higher protein concentrations within a hypocaloric protocol. Methods: This was a multicenter, randomized, open‐label clinical trial with parallel design in overweight/obese mechanically ventilated critically ill patients prescribed 1.5 g protein/kg ideal body weight/day. Patients received either an experimental very high‐protein (37%) and low‐carbohydrate (29%) or control high‐protein (25%) and conventional‐carbohydrate (45%) EN formula. Results: A prespecified interim analysis was performed after enrollment of 105 patients (52 experimental, 53 control). Protein and energy delivery for controls and experimental groups on days 1–5 were 1.2 ± 0.4 and 1.1 ± 0.3 g/kg ideal body weight/day (P = 0.83), and 18.2 ± 6.0 and 12.5 ± 3.7 kcals/kg ideal body weight/day (P < .0001), respectively. The combined rate of glucose events outside the range of > 110 and ≤ 150 mg/dL were not different (P = 0.54, primary endpoint); thereby the trial was terminated. The mean blood glucose for the control and the experimental groups were 138 (−SD 108, +SD 177) and 126 (−SD 99, +SD 160) mg/dL (P = 0.004), respectively. Mean rate of glucose events > 150 mg/dL decreased (Δ = −13%, P = 0.015), whereas that of 80–110 mg/dL increased (Δ = 14%, P = 0.0007). Insulin administration decreased 10.9% (95% CI, −22% to 0.1%; p = 0.048) in the experimental group relative to the controls. Glycemic events ≤ 80 mg/dL and rescue dextrose use were not different (P = 0.23 and P = 0.53). Conclusions: A very high‐protein and low‐carbohydrate EN formula in a hypocaloric protocol reduces hyperglycemic events and insulin requirements while increasing glycemic events between 80–110 mg/dL.

Clinical Relevancy Statement

Stress hyperglycemia frequently occurs in critically ill patients independently worsening clinical outcomes. Insulin is currently the main treatment for stress hyperglycemia, but it is associated with side effects, limiting its utility. This article pragmatically explores whether an enteral nutrition formula containing higher protein and lower carbohydrate concentrations may facilitate glucose control, decreasing hyperglycemic events while reducing insulin utilization when used in a hypocaloric nutrition protocol.

Methods

Study Participants

We conducted a multicenter, randomized, open‐label clinical trial with parallel design in the United States (6 sites) and Canada (1 site; clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT02337556). The design of the study was approved by the ethics board of each hospital. Informed consent was obtained from all patients prior to any study procedure.

Patients were eligible if they were mechanically ventilated, critically ill, overweight, and obese (body mass index [BMI] 26–45) and required enteral nutrition (EN) for 5 days or longer. Exclusion criteria included a history of surgery, trauma, type I diabetes mellitus or diabetic ketoacidosis, pregnancy, and requirement for parenteral nutrition. Patients with type II diabetes who were on insulin prior to their admission were initially excluded; however, due to slow recruitment, the protocol was amended to include these patients.

Randomization

Patients were randomized to experimental or control EN formulas. Randomization was dynamically stratified by center using Medidata‐Balance with equal allocation ratio.

Interventions

The experimental formula contained high‐whey peptides (37%) and low carbohydrates (29%) (Peptamen Intense VHP, Nestlé Health Science, Bridgewater, NJ). The control formula contained a standard polymeric protein (25%) and high carbohydrates (45%; Replete, Nestlé Health Science, Bridgewater, NJ; Table 1). Both EN formulae had the same caloric density (1 kcal/mL). EN was initiated within 48 hours of admission into the study and advanced until protein goal (1.5 g/kg IBW/d) was achieved. Because of the difference in concentrations in nonprotein calories between the 2 formulas, a protocol aimed at achieving the same amount of protein would result in lower delivery of calories in the experimental group conforming to a hypocaloric regimen. Similarly, as the concentrations of protein in the 2 formulas were different, the volume of delivery of the control formula was higher when compared with the experimental formula to meet protein goals (Table 2). Analysis of nutrition intake excluded the last ICU day because patients were likely to be taken off EN around this time.
