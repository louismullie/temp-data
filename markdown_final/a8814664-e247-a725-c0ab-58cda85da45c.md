## Question

What is the dosing of prednisone for an acute asthma flare?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about prednisone dosing for an acute asthma flare. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and when systemic corticosteroids are indicated. Then, I should verify adult dosing, including dose, duration, and whether tapering is needed. Next, I will review pediatric dosing by age group and reconcile any discrepancies. After that, I should consider alternatives like dexamethasone and how to handle nonresponders. Finally, I will integrate safety, adherence, and follow-up considerations and synthesize a concise, practical recommendation with citations.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and indications for systemic corticosteroids in acute asthma, because I need to ensure we are not overgeneralizing to mild exacerbations. Systemic corticosteroids are indicated for moderate to severe exacerbations, particularly when symptoms persist despite increased reliever and maintenance therapy, or when lung function is below 60% of personal best or predicted, and they should be started promptly, ideally within 1 hour of presentation, given their delayed onset of benefit and proven reduction in relapse risk [^113KRmut] [^113KRmut] [^116KTsTS].

> Now, for adults, I should confirm the exact prednisone dose and duration. Multiple high-credibility sources converge on prednisone 40–50 mg orally once daily for 5–7 days, with no need to taper if the course is under 2 weeks, and with morning dosing preferred after the first dose to minimize insomnia. This aligns with GINA guidance and FDA labeling, and is supported by evidence that shorter courses are as effective as longer ones and that higher doses do not improve outcomes [^112b2Sjb] [^111EEe41] [^111vyWEz] [^115sPaLx].

> Wait, let me verify the pediatric dosing by age, because I recall seeing conflicting maxima. For children 6–11 years, the standard regimen is prednisone or prednisolone 1–2 mg/kg/day up to a maximum of 40 mg/day for 3–5 days, typically without tapering, which is consistent across GINA documents and FDA pediatric labeling [^112yZBrQ] [^111EEe41] [^114zsRLf]. For children 2–5 years, GINA specifies a lower maximum of 30 mg/day, and for children under 2 years, a maximum of 20 mg/day, which I should explicitly state to avoid over-dosing in younger children [^112MXZew] [^115Sbu4q].

> Hold on, I should verify the rationale for not tapering short courses, because clinicians often ask about this. Tapering is unnecessary for courses under 2 weeks because HPA axis suppression is not expected with brief bursts, and abrupt cessation is safe when patients return to maintenance ICS-containing therapy and are clinically improved, which is supported by endocrine guidance and GINA statements [^112yXkR9] [^115sPaLx].

> Next, I should review alternatives, especially dexamethasone, and ensure I get the dosing right. In adults, oral dexamethasone 12–16 mg once daily for 1–2 days has similar relapse and adverse events compared with 3–5 days of prednisolone, with better adherence and less vomiting; in children, 0.3–0.6 mg/kg once daily for 1–2 days is noninferior to multi-day prednisolone in many studies, though some adult and pediatric trials show small, nonclinically significant differences in relapse, so I should counsel on expected trade-offs and specify that dexamethasone should not be continued beyond 2 days without reassessment [^111EEe41] [^115zSY4A] [^116tZzDe] [^1167aHML] [^1152CnrF].

> I need to ensure I address nonresponders and escalation. If symptoms fail to resolve or relapse after dexamethasone, switching to prednisolone is reasonable, and in severe or life-threatening presentations, higher initial systemic steroid dosing may be considered transiently, but routine supratherapeutic dosing is not supported and may increase adverse effects without added benefit, so I should tailor escalation to severity and response rather than default to higher doses [^111EEe41] [^112QgzPX].

> Let me consider safety and cumulative exposure, because repeated bursts matter. Even short courses contribute to cumulative steroid exposure, and risks rise with as few as 4–5 lifetime bursts; therefore, I should document each course, minimize unnecessary use, and reinforce exacerbation prevention with ICS-containing therapy, inhaler technique, and trigger avoidance, while counseling on short-term side effects like mood changes, appetite increase, and sleep disturbance [^114QTrxX] [^114HuCD1].

> I should double-check adherence and formulation issues that can derail therapy. Palatability and vomiting with prednisolone liquid can reduce adherence, which is why dexamethasone is often favored in children; if prednisolone is used, consider dispersible tablets or mixing strategies, and if dexamethasone is chosen, ensure caregivers understand the 1–2 day limit and follow-up plan to reassess response [^111EEe41] [^115PDbnY].

> Next, I should review follow-up and discharge planning, because the steroid course is only one piece. Before stopping oral steroids, reassess symptoms, lung function if feasible, and vitals; on discharge, ensure ICS-containing controller therapy is initiated or stepped up for 2–4 weeks after a severe exacerbation, and provide a written action plan that specifies when to start steroids, what dose, and when to seek urgent care, which reduces relapse risk and improves outcomes [^1157R5if] [^116KTsTS].

> Putting this together, my final, clinically actionable recommendation is as follows, and I should confirm it matches the evidence base. For adults with a moderate to severe acute asthma flare, prescribe prednisone 40–50 mg orally once daily for 5–7 days, no taper if under 2 weeks, and prefer morning dosing after the first dose; for children 6–11 years, prednisone or prednisolone 1–2 mg/kg/day up to 40 mg/day for 3–5 days; for children 2–5 years, 1–2 mg/kg/day up to 30 mg/day for 3–5 days; for children under 2 years, 1–2 mg/kg/day up to 20 mg/day for up to 5 days; consider dexamethasone 0.3–0.6 mg/kg once daily for 1–2 days in children or 12–16 mg once daily for 1–2 days in adults when adherence or vomiting is a concern, with reassessment and switch to prednisolone if symptoms persist or relapse [^112b2Sjb] [^111EEe41] [^112yZBrQ] [^112MXZew] [^115Sbu4q] [^115zSY4A].

---

For an acute asthma flare, the standard prednisone dose is **40–50 mg orally once daily** [^112b2Sjb] for adults for 5–7 days [^111EEe41]; tapering is not required if the course is under 2 weeks [^115sPaLx]. For children, use **1–2 mg/kg/day** (max 40 mg/day) [^112yZBrQ] for 3–5 days [^111EEe41]; tapering is not needed for short courses [^115sPaLx]. Start as early as possible [^116KTsTS] to reduce relapse and speed recovery [^116KTsTS].

---

## Adult dosing

- **Standard dose**: 40–50 mg orally once daily for 5–7 days [^112b2Sjb] [^111EEe41].
- **Tapering**: Not required for courses under 2 weeks [^115sPaLx].
- **Timing**: Start as early as possible [^116KTsTS] to reduce relapse and speed recovery [^11765Qen].

---

## Pediatric dosing

- **Standard dose**: 1–2 mg/kg/day (max 40 mg/day) [^112yZBrQ] for 3–5 days [^111EEe41].
- **Tapering**: Not required for short courses [^115sPaLx].
- **Age-specific maxima**: ≤ 2 years: 20 mg/day; 3–5 years: 30 mg/day [^112MXZew].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting dosing

- **Adults**: 40–50 mg/day for 5–7 days is effective and safe; tapering is unnecessary for short courses [^112b2Sjb] [^115sPaLx].
- **Children**: 1–2 mg/kg/day (max 40 mg) for 3–5 days is effective; tapering is not needed for short courses [^112yZBrQ] [^115sPaLx].

---

## Alternative corticosteroid regimens

Dexamethasone is an alternative, particularly in children, due to its longer half-life and simpler dosing: **adults** 12–16 mg orally once daily for 1–2 days [^111MSQZB] [^111EEe41], and **children** 0.3–0.6 mg/kg once daily for 1–2 days [^111EEe41] [^115zSY4A].

---

## Clinical considerations

- **Severity**: Adjust dose based on severity and response [^112QgzPX].
- **Comorbidities**: Use caution in diabetes, hypertension, or infection [^notfound].
- **Monitoring**: Watch for hyperglycemia, hypertension, mood changes, and GI effects [^114QTrxX].

Background

Asthma is a common long-term breathing condition that affects approximately 300 million people worldwide. People with asthma may experience short-term worsening of their asthma symptoms; these episodes are often known as 'exacerbations', 'flare-ups', 'attacks' or 'acute asthma'. Oral steroids, which have a potent anti-inflammatory effect, are recommended for all but the most mild asthma exacerbations; they should be initiated promptly. The most often prescribed oral steroids are prednisolone and dexamethasone, but current guidelines on dosing vary between countries, and often among different guideline producers within the same country. Despite their proven efficacy, use of steroids needs to be balanced against their potential to cause important adverse events. Evidence is somewhat limited regarding optimal dosing of oral steroids for asthma exacerbations to maximise recovery while minimising potential side effects, which is the topic of this review.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of any dose or duration of oral steroids versus any other dose or duration of oral steroids for adults and children with an asthma exacerbation.

Search Methods

We identified trials from the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register (CAGR), ClinicalTrials.gov (www. ClinicalTrials.gov), the World Health Organization (WHO) trials portal (www.who.int/ictrp/en/) and reference lists of all primary studies and review articles. This search was up to date as of April 2016.

Selection Criteria

We included parallel randomised controlled trials (RCTs), irrespective of blinding or duration, that evaluated one dose or duration of oral steroid versus any other dose or duration, for management of asthma exacerbations. We included studies involving both adults and children with asthma of any severity, in which investigators analysed adults and children separately. We allowed any other co-intervention in the management of an asthma exacerbation, provided it was not part of the randomised treatment. We included studies reported as full text, those published as abstract only and unpublished data.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened the search results for included trials, extracted numerical data and assessed risk of bias; all data were cross-checked for accuracy. We resolved disagreements by discussion with the third review author or with an external advisor. We analysed dichotomous data as odds ratios (ORs) or risk differences (RDs) using study participants as the unit of analysis; we analysed continuous data as mean differences (MDs). We used a random-effects model, and we carried out a fixed-effect analysis if we detected statistical heterogeneity. We rated all outcomes using the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) system and presented results in 'Summary of findings' tables.

Main Results

We included 18 studies that randomised a total of 2438 participants - both adults and children - and performed comparisons of interest. Included studies assessed higher versus lower doses of prednisolone (n = 4); longer versus shorter courses of prednisolone (n = 3) or dexamethasone (n = 1); tapered versus non-tapered courses of prednisolone (n = 4); and prednisolone versus dexamethasone (n = 6). Follow-up duration ranged from seven days to six months. The smallest study randomised just 15 participants, and the largest 638 (median 93). The varied interventions and outcomes reported limited the number of meaningful meta-analyses that we could perform. For two of our primary outcomes - hospital admission and serious adverse events - events were too infrequent to permit conclusions about the superiority of one treatment over the other, or their equivalence. Researchers in the included studies reported asthma symptoms in different ways and rarely used validated scales, again limiting our conclusions. Secondary outcome meta-analysis was similarly hampered by heterogeneity among interventions and outcome measures used. Overall, we found no convincing evidence of differences in outcomes between a higher dose or longer course and a lower dose or shorter course of prednisolone or dexamethasone, or between prednisolone and dexamethasone. Included studies were generally of reasonable methodological quality. Review authors assessed most outcomes in the review as having low or very low quality, meaning we are not confident in the effect estimates. The predominant reason for downgrading was imprecision, but indirectness and risk of bias also reduced our confidence in some estimates.

Authors' Conclusions

Evidence is not strong enough to reveal whether shorter or lower-dose regimens are generally less effective than longer or higher-dose regimens, or indeed that the latter are associated with more adverse events. Any changes recommended for current practice should be supported by data from larger, well-designed trials. Varied study design and outcome measures limited the number of meta-analyses that we could perform. Greater emphasis on palatability and on whether some regimens might be easier to adhere to than others could better inform clinical decisions for individual patients.

### Dexamethasone compared to prednisone for the treatment of children with acute asthma exacerbations [^114eVmd6]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2018). Low credibility.

Systemic corticosteroids are recommended in clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of acute asthma exacerbation based on evidence demonstrating reduced hospitalizations and improved outcomes after administration in the emergency department. Although prednisone and related oral preparations have been recommended previously, researchers have assessed dexamethasone as an alternative based on its longer biologic half-life and improved palatability. Systematic reviews of multiple small trials and 2 larger trials have found no difference in revisits to the emergency department compared to prednisone for dexamethasone given either as an intramuscular injection or orally. Studies of oral administration have found reduced emesis for dexamethasone compared to prednisone both in the emergency department and for a second oral dose, typically given 24 to 48 hours later. Studies assessing a single dose of dexamethasone have found equivalent improvement at follow-up but with some evidence of increased symptoms and increased need for additional corticosteroids compared to multiple doses of prednisone. Future research could further assess dexamethasone dose, formulation, and frequency and measure other related adverse effects such as behavior change. Consideration of baseline differences within the heterogeneous population of children requiring acute care for asthma may also guide the design of an optimal dexamethasone regimen.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^111EEe41]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Systemic corticosteroids — adult and pediatric dosing and duration for asthma exacerbations are specified: daily doses of oral corticosteroids (OCS) equivalent to 50 mg prednisolone as a single morning dose, or 200 mg hydrocortisone in divided doses are typically used for adults, and for children a prednisolone dose of 1–2 mg/kg up to a maximum of 40 mg/day is suggested; evidence does not demonstrate a benefit of intramuscular or intravenous over oral routes. For duration, 5- and 7-day courses in adults are as effective as 10- and 14-day courses respectively, and in most children a 3–5-day course is usually considered sufficient, and there is no benefit in tapering OCS either in the short term or over several weeks. Oral dexamethasone 12–16 mg given once daily for 1–2 days has similar relapse and adverse events to prednisolone for 3–5 days; in children, 0.3 mg/kg or 0.6 mg/kg once daily for 1–2 days shows no difference in relapse versus prednisolone/prednisone for 3–5 days, with better adherence and substantially lower risk of vomiting; oral dexamethasone should not be continued beyond 2 days, and if there is failure of resolution or relapse, consideration should be given to switching to prednisolone.

### Are inhaled corticosteroids effective for acute exacerbations of asthma in children? [^1148qzha]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2003). Low credibility.

If started early and at high doses, the acute use of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) provides modest benefit in patients with mild exacerbations of asthma. In more severe exacerbations, oral corticosteroids are significantly more effective in preventing hospitalizations and improving lung function. We conclude that ICS should not be used routinely to treat acute exacerbations.

### An umbrella review: corticosteroid therapy for adults with acute asthma [^114YeeUY]. The American Journal of Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

The objective of this "umbrella" review is to synthesize the evidence and provide clinicians a single report that summarizes the state of knowledge regarding the use of corticosteroids in adults with acute asthma. Systematic reviews in the Cochrane Library and additional clinical trials published in English from 1966 to 2007 in MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and Cochrane CENTRAL, and references from bibliographies of pertinent articles were reviewed. Results indicate that the evidence base is frequently limited to small, single-center studies. Findings suggest that therapy with systemic corticosteroids accelerates the resolution of acute asthma and reduces the risk of relapse. There is no evidence that corticosteroid doses greater than standard doses (prednisone 50–100 mg equivalent) are beneficial. Oral and intravenous corticosteroids, as well as intramuscular and oral corticosteroid regimens, seem to be similarly effective. A nontapered 5- to 10-day course of corticosteroid therapy seems to be sufficient for most discharged patients. Combinations of oral and inhaled corticosteroids on emergency department/hospital discharge might minimize the risk of relapse.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^113KRmut]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Global Strategy for Asthma Management — oral corticosteroids (OCS) action plan dosing and triggers: For most patients, the written asthma action plan should provide instructions for when and how to commence OCS, with a short course used for adults at 40–50 mg/day usually for 5–7 days for patients who fail to respond to an increase in reliever and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)-containing maintenance medication for 2–3 days, deteriorate rapidly or have a peak expiratory flow (PEF) or forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) < 60% of their personal best or predicted value, or have worsening asthma and a history of sudden severe exacerbations; for children 6–11 years, the recommended dose of prednisone is 1–2 mg/kg/day to a maximum of 40 mg/day, usually for 3–5 days, and patients should be advised about common side-effects and should contact their doctor if they start taking OCS.

### Increased versus stable doses of inhaled corticosteroids for exacerbations of chronic asthma in adults and children [^115z1egX]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

People with asthma may experience exacerbations or "attacks" during which their symptoms worsen and additional treatment is required. Written action plans may advocate doubling the dose of inhaled steroids in the early stages of an asthma exacerbation to reduce the severity of the attack and to prevent the need for oral steroids or hospital admission.

Objectives

To compare the clinical effectiveness and safety of increased versus stable doses of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) as part of a patient-initiated action plan for home management of exacerbations in children and adults with persistent asthma.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register, which is derived from searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) to March 2016. We handsearched respiratory journals and meeting abstracts.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared increased versus stable doses of ICS for home management of asthma exacerbations. We included studies of children or adults with persistent asthma who were receiving daily maintenance ICS.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected trials, assessed quality and extracted data. We contacted authors of RCTs for additional information.

Main Results

This review update added three new studies including 419 participants to the review. In total, we identified eight RCTs, most of which were at low risk of bias, involving 1669 participants with mild to moderate asthma. We included three paediatric (n = 422) and five adult (n = 1247) studies; six were parallel-group trials and two had a cross-over design. All but one study followed participants for six months to one year. Allowed maintenance doses of ICS varied in adult and paediatric studies, as did use of concomitant medications and doses of ICS initiated during exacerbations. Investigators gave participants a study inhaler containing additional ICS or placebo to be started as part of an action plan for treatment of exacerbations. The odds of treatment failure, defined as the need for oral corticosteroids, were not significantly reduced among those randomised to increased ICS compared with those taking their usual stable maintenance dose (odds ratio (OR) 0.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.68 to 1.18; participants = 1520; studies = 7). When we analysed only people who actually took their study inhaler for an exacerbation, we found much variation between study results but the evidence did not show a significant benefit of increasing ICS dose (OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.30; participants = 766; studies = 7). The odds of having an unscheduled physician visit (OR 0.96, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.41; participants = 931; studies = 3) or acute visit (Peto OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.24 to 3.98; participants = 450; studies = 3) were not significantly reduced by an increased versus stable dose of ICS, and evidence was insufficient to permit assessment of impact on the duration of exacerbation; our ability to draw conclusions from these outcomes was limited by the number of studies reporting these events and by the number of events included in the analyses. The odds of serious events (OR 1.69, 95% CI 0.77 to 3.71; participants = 394; studies = 2) and non-serious events, such as oral irritation, headaches and changes in appetite (OR 2.15, 95% CI 0.68 to 6.73; participants = 142; studies = 2), were neither increased nor decreased significantly by increased versus stable doses of ICS during an exacerbation. Too few studies are available to allow firm conclusions on the basis of subgroup analyses conducted to investigate the impact of age, time to treatment initiation, doses used, smoking history and the fold increase of ICS on the magnitude of effect; yet, effect size appears similar in children and adults.

Authors' Conclusions

Current evidence does not support increasing the dose of ICS as part of a self initiated action plan to treat exacerbations in adults and children with mild to moderate asthma. Increased ICS dose is not associated with a statistically significant reduction in the odds of requiring rescue oral corticosteroids for the exacerbation, or of having adverse events, compared with a stable ICS dose. Wide confidence intervals for several outcomes mean we cannot rule out possible benefits of this approach.

### Two days of dexamethasone versus 5 days of prednisone in the treatment of acute asthma: a randomized controlled trial [^116tZzDe]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Study Objective

Dexamethasone has a longer half-life than prednisone and is well tolerated orally. We compare the time needed to return to normal activity and the frequency of relapse after acute exacerbation in adults receiving either 5 days of prednisone or 2 days of dexamethasone.

Methods

We randomized adult emergency department patients (aged 18 to 45 years) with acute exacerbations of asthma (peak expiratory flow rate less than 80% of ideal) to receive either 50 mg of daily oral prednisone for 5 days or 16 mg of daily oral dexamethasone for 2 days. Outcomes were assessed by telephone follow-up.

Results

Ninety-six prednisone and 104 dexamethasone subjects completed the study regimen and follow-up. More patients in the dexamethasone group reported a return to normal activities within 3 days compared with the prednisone group (90% versus 80%; difference 10%; 95% confidence interval 0% to 20%; P = 0.049). Relapse was similar between groups (13% versus 11%; difference 2%; 95% confidence interval -7% to 11%, P = 0.67).

Conclusion

In acute exacerbations of asthma in adults, 2 days of oral dexamethasone is at least as effective as 5 days of oral prednisone in returning patients to their normal level of activity and preventing relapse.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^112G8gaC]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Systemic corticosteroids — indications, dosing duration, and precautions: medications include prednisone, prednisolone, methylprednisolone, hydrocortisone tablets, and dexamethasone, given by tablets or suspension or by IM or IV injection; short-term treatment (usually 5–7 days in adults) is important for severe acute exacerbations with main effects seen after 4–6 hours, oral corticosteroid (OCS) therapy is preferred to IM or IV therapy and is effective in preventing short-term relapse, tapering is required if OCS are given for more than 2 weeks, and patients should be reviewed after any exacerbation; as a last resort, long-term OCS may be required for some patients with severe asthma but serious side-effects are problematic, and such patients should be referred for specialist review if available to have treatment optimized and phenotype assessed.

### Increased versus stable doses of inhaled corticosteroids for exacerbations of chronic asthma in adults and children [^115mUwa7]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

People with asthma may experience exacerbations, or 'attacks', during which their symptoms worsen and additional treatment is required. Written action plans sometimes advocate a short-term increase in the dose of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) at the first sign of an exacerbation to reduce the severity of the attack and to prevent the need for oral steroids or hospital admission.

Objectives

To compare the clinical effectiveness and safety of increased versus stable doses of ICS as part of a patient-initiated action plan for the home management of exacerbations in children and adults with persistent asthma.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register, which is derived from searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature), and handsearched abstracts to 20 December 2021. We also searched major trial registries for ongoing trials.

Selection Criteria

We included parallel and cross-over randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that allocated people with persistent asthma to take a blinded inhaler in the event of an exacerbation which either increased their daily dose of ICS or kept it stable (placebo).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected trials, assessed quality, and extracted data. We reassessed risk of bias for all studies at the result level using the revised risk of bias tool for RCTs (Risk of Bias 2), and employed the GRADE approach to assess our confidence in the synthesised effect estimates. The primary outcome was treatment failure, defined as the need for rescue oral steroids in the randomised population. Secondary outcomes were treatment failure in the subset who initiated the study inhaler (treated population), unscheduled physician visits, unscheduled acute care, emergency department or hospital visits, serious and non-serious adverse events, and duration of exacerbation.

Main Results

This review update added a new study that increased the number of people in the primary analysis from 1520 to 1774, and incorporates the most up-to-date methods to assess the likely impact of bias within the meta-analyses. The updated review now includes nine RCTs (1923 participants; seven parallel and two cross-over) conducted in Europe, North America, and Australasia and published between 1998 and 2018. Five studies evaluated adult populations (n = 1247; ≥ 15 years), and four studies evaluated child or adolescent populations (n = 676; < 15 years). All study participants had mild to moderate asthma. Studies varied in the dose of maintenance ICS, age, fold increase of ICS in the event of an exacerbation, criteria for initiating the study inhaler, and allowed medications. Approximately 50% of randomised participants initiated the study inhaler (range 23% to 100%), and the included studies reported treatment failure in a variety of ways, meaning assumptions were required to permit the combining of data. Participants randomised to increase their ICS dose at the first signs of an exacerbation had similar odds of needing rescue oral corticosteroids to those randomised to a placebo inhaler (odds ratio (OR) 0.97, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.76 to 1.25; 8 studies; 1774 participants; I² = 0%; moderate quality evidence). We could draw no firm conclusions from subgroup analyses conducted to investigate the impact of age, time to treatment initiation, baseline dose, smoking history, and fold increase of ICS on the primary outcome. Results for the same outcome in the subset of participants who initiated the study inhaler were unchanged from the previous version, which provides a different point estimate with very low confidence due to heterogeneity, imprecision, and risk of bias (OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.30; 7 studies; 766 participants; I² = 42%; random-effects model). Confidence was reduced due to risk of bias and assumptions that had to be made to include study data in the intention-to-treat and treated-population analyses. Sensitivity analyses that tested the impact of assumptions made for synthesis and to exclude cross-over studies, studies at overall high risk of bias, and those with commercial funding did not change our conclusions. Pooled effects for unscheduled physician visits, unscheduled acute care, emergency department or hospital visits, and duration of exacerbation made it very difficult to determine where the true effect may lie, and confidence was reduced by risk of bias. Point estimates for both serious and non-serious adverse events favoured keeping ICS stable, but imprecision and risk of bias due to missing data and outcome measurement and reporting reduced our confidence in the effects (serious adverse events: OR 1.69, 95% CI 0.77 to 3.71; 2 studies; 394 participants; I² = 0%; non-serious adverse events: OR 2.15, 95% CI 0.68 to 6.73; 2 studies; 142 participants; I² = 0%).

Authors' Conclusions

Evidence from double-blind trials of adults and children with mild to moderate asthma suggests there is unlikely to be an important reduction in the need for oral steroids from increasing a patient's ICS dose at the first sign of an exacerbation. Other clinically important benefits and potential harms of increased doses of ICS compared with keeping the dose stable cannot be ruled out due to wide confidence intervals, risk of bias in the trials, and assumptions that had to be made for synthesis. Included studies conducted between 1998 and 2018 reflect evolving clinical practice and study methods, and the data do not support thorough investigation of effect modifiers such as baseline dose, fold increase, asthma severity and timing. The review does not include recent evidence from pragmatic, unblinded studies showing benefits of larger dose increases in those with poorly controlled asthma. A systematic review is warranted to examine the differences between the blinded and unblinded trials using robust methods for assessing risk of bias to present the most complete view of the evidence for decision makers.

### Doubling the dose of inhaled corticosteroid to prevent asthma exacerbations: randomised controlled trial [^111dqCZv]. Lancet (2004). Excellent credibility.

Background

Asthma self-management plans that include doubling the dose of inhaled corticosteroid when the condition deteriorates improve asthma control. Whether doubling the dose of corticosteroid in isolation is effective is unknown. We undertook a randomised controlled trial to investigate the effects of doubling the dose of inhaled corticosteriods when asthma deteriorates.

Methods

390 individuals with asthma who were at risk of an exacerbation monitored their morning peak flow and asthma symptoms for up to 12 months. When peak flow or symptoms started to deteriorate, participants added an active or placebo corticosteroid inhaler to their usual corticosteroid for 14 days to produce a doubling or no change in dose. The primary outcome was the number of individuals starting oral prednisolone in each group.

Findings

During 12 months, 207 (53%) started their study inhaler and 46 (12%) started prednisolone — 22 (11%) of 192 and 24 (12%) of 198 in the active and placebo groups, respectively. The risk ratio for starting prednisolone was therefore 0.95 (95% CI 0.55–1.64, p = 0.8).

Interpretation

We recorded little evidence to support the widely recommended intervention of doubling the dose of inhaled corticosteroid when asthma control starts to deteriorate.

Acute asthma — Although there is a strong emphasis on minimizing oral corticosteroid (OCS) use to reduce long-term cumulative adverse effects, OCS are essential in management of acute severe asthma, and the occurrence of any severe exacerbation should be a prompt to assess the patient thoroughly, optimize their asthma treatment, and consider referral for expert advice to reduce the risk of another exacerbation occurring; evidence about use of dexamethasone has been updated based on the latest evidence.

### Corticosteroids for acute severe asthma in hospitalised patients [^111Egr2h]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Corticosteroids are currently used routinely in the management of acute severe asthma. The optimal dose and route of administration continues to be debated. Some investigators have reported a greater benefit of higher doses of corticosteroids in the management of severe asthma, while others have not.

Objectives

To determine whether higher doses of systemic corticosteroids (oral, intravenous or intramuscular) are more effective than lower doses in the management of patients with acute severe asthma requiring hospital admission.

Search Strategy

Randomised controlled trials were identified from the Cochrane Airways Group Asthma Register. In addition, primary authors and content experts were contacted to identify eligible studies. Bibliographies from included studies, known reviews and texts were also searched.

Selection Criteria

Studies were selected for inclusion in the review if they met the following broad inclusion criteria: described as randomised controlled trials, included patients with acute severe asthma, compared different doses of corticosteroids (any route) in 2 or more treatment arms, and had a minimum period of follow up of 24 hours. Two reviewers independently assessed the studies for inclusion and disagreement was resolved by third party adjudication.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were extracted independently by two reviewers if the authors were unable to verify the validity of information. Missing data were obtained from authors or calculated from other data presented in the paper. The data were analysed as weighted mean differences (WMD) for primary pulmonary function outcomes using a fixed effects model. For the purposes of the review, three broad categories of corticosteroid dose (equivalent dose of methylprednisolone in 24 hours) were defined in advance: low dose (≤ 80 mg), medium dose (> 80 mg and ≤ 360 mg) and high dose (> 360 mg). There were thus 3 main comparison groups: low versus medium dose, medium versus high dose and low versus high dose.

Main Results

Nine trials were included; a total of 344 adult patients have been studied (96 with low dose, 85 with medium dose and 163 with high dose corticosteroids). Only 6 trials provided sufficient data for the meta-analysis. There were no clinically or statistically significant differences detected in % predicted FEV1 among comparison groups after 24, 48 or 72 hours. At 48 hours, the weighted mean difference was -3.3% predicted (95% confidence interval -12.4 to + 5.8) for the low vs medium dose comparison, -1.9% predicted (95% CI -8.1 to + 4.3) for the medium vs high dose comparison and + 0.5% predicted (95% CI - 7.8 to + 8.8) for the low vs high dose comparison. There appeared to be no significant differences in side effects or rates of respiratory failure among the varying doses of corticosteroids. A further search was conducted on 3rd August 2000. No new trials were identified.

Reviewer's Conclusions

No differences were identified among the different doses of corticosteroids in acute asthma requiring hospital admission. Low dose corticosteroids (≤ 80 mg/day of methylprednisolone or ≤ 400 mg/day of hydrocortisone) appear to be adequate in the initial management of these adult patients. Higher doses do not appear to offer a therapeutic advantage.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^111vyWEz]. GINA (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for asthma, more specifically with respect to management of exacerbation, self-management, GINA 2025 guidelines recommend to consider adding a short course of oral corticosteroids (40–50 mg/day for 5–7 days for adults/adolescents; 0.5 mg/kg/day, maximum 40 mg/day, for 3–5 days for children) for severe exacerbations, such as peak expiratory flow or FEV1 < 60% personal best or predicted, or if not responding to above treatment over 2–3 days. Prefer morning dosing after first dose to minimize insomnia. Advise patients about potential adverse effects. Do not offer tapering if oral corticosteroids are taken for < 2 weeks.

### A randomized controlled noninferiority trial of single dose of Oral dexamethasone versus 5 days of oral prednisone in acute Adult asthma [^1167aHML]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Study Objective

Oral dexamethasone demonstrates bioavailability similar to that of oral prednisone but has a longer half-life. We evaluate whether a single dose of oral dexamethasone plus 4 days of placebo is not inferior to 5 days of oral prednisone in treatment of adults with mild to moderate asthma exacerbations to prevent relapse defined as an unscheduled return visit for additional treatment for persistent or worsening asthma within 14 days.

Methods

Adult emergency department patients (aged 18 to 55 years) were randomized to receive either a single dose of 12 mg of oral dexamethasone with 4 days of placebo or a 5-day course of oral prednisone 60 mg a day. Outcomes including relapse were assessed by a follow-up telephone interview at 2 weeks.

Results

One hundred seventy-three dexamethasone and 203 prednisone subjects completed the study regimen and telephone follow-up. The dexamethasone group by a small margin surpassed the preset 8% difference between groups for noninferiority in relapse rates within 14 days (12.1% versus 9.8%; difference 2.3%; 95% confidence interval -4.1% to 8.6%). Subjects in the 2 groups had similar rates of hospitalization for their relapse visit (dexamethasone 3.4% versus prednisone 2.9%; difference 0.5%; 95% confidence interval -4.1% to 3.1%). Adverse effect rates were generally the same in the 2 groups.

Conclusion

A single dose of oral dexamethasone did not demonstrate noninferiority to prednisone for 5 days by a very small margin for treatment of adults with mild to moderate asthma exacerbations. Enhanced compliance and convenience may support the use of dexamethasone regardless.

### Corticosteroid therapy for acute asthma [^112MC3M8]. Respiratory Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease, which is characterised by reversible airflow obstruction in response to a variety of stimuli. Exacerbations in response to airway irritants are part of the natural history of asthma, but often they also represent a failure in chronic treatment. Presentations to emergency departments and other acute care settings are common and frequently lead to hospitalisation and other complications. After treatment, however, most patients are discharged to the care of their primary care physician for further management. This review highlights the role of systemic and inhaled corticosteroids as mainstays of treatment in the acute and sub-acute phase of an exacerbation. These agents form the basis of most current clinical practice guidelines, yet their use is not universal. We will review the evidence for the use of these agents that arises from the Cochrane Collaboration of Systematic Reviews contained in the Cochrane Library.

### Best practice advice for asthma exacerbation prevention and management in primary care: an international expert consensus [^114HuCD1]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Actively Address Asthma Exacerbation Management and Prevention

Best Practice Advice 5: Recognize the cumulative adverse effects of systemic corticosteroids (SCS) use and work to avoid their overuse by preventing future exacerbations

While some asthma exacerbations may require SCS, earlier recognition and use of ICS with SABA or fast-acting LABA for quick relief or early in an exacerbation may mitigate the need for SCS. Rarely, if ever, are SCS required for effective maintenance management, and their use should be minimized where possible due to potential short-term and long-term adverse effects.

Adverse effects resulting from SCS use occur based on cumulative lifetime dose, starting at doses as low as 500 mg of prednisone or equivalent and less than 30 days of exposure. Adverse effects of SCS can occur with both chronic and repeated episodic use with cumulative doses ≥ 1000 mg of prednisone equivalent per year, regardless of the length of treatment. A common regimen for exacerbation management is prednisone (or equivalent) 40–60 mg for 5–10 days, adding up to a cumulative dose of 200–600 mg per exacerbation, approaching or exceeding the long-term effect risk threshold after even a single course of SCS. Higher cumulative SCS doses are associated with increases in cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, fractures, cerebrovascular disease, pneumonia, kidney impairment, cataracts, sleep apnea, depression, anxiety, type 2 diabetes, and weight gain –.

To limit the use of SCS, PCCs can implement asthma treatment that appropriately uses ICS-based therapies in both acute and maintenance regimens, thereby reducing the risk of exacerbations and the need for SCS. PCCs should include monitoring patients for adverse effects of corticosteroids, especially among those with multiple courses of SCS therapy over the years of their asthma care.

### Is dexamethasone an effective alternative to oral prednisone in the treatment of pediatric asthma exacerbations? [^111Yww9g]. Hospital Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Background

A short course of systemic corticosteroids is an important therapy in the treatment of pediatric asthma exacerbations. Although a 5-day course of oral prednisone or prednisolone has become the most commonly used regimen, dexamethasone has also been used for a shorter duration (1–2 days) with potential for improvement in compliance and palatability. We reviewed the literature to determine if there is sufficient evidence that dexamethasone can be used as an effective alternative in the treatment of pediatric asthma exacerbations in the inpatient setting.

Methods

A Medline search was conducted on the use of dexamethasone in the treatment of asthma exacerbations in children. The studies selected were clinical trials comparing the efficacy of dexamethasone with prednisone. Meta-analysis was performed examining physician revisitation rates and symptomatic return to baseline.

Results

Six completed pediatric clinical trials met the inclusion criteria. All of the pediatric trials found that prednisone is not superior to dexamethasone in treating mild to moderate asthma exacerbations. Meta-analysis demonstrated homogeneity between the dexamethasone and prednisone groups when examining symptomatic return to baseline and unplanned physician revisits after the initial emergency department encounter. Some studies found potential additional benefits of dexamethasone, including improved compliance and less vomiting.

Conclusions

The current literature suggests that dexamethasone can be used as an effective alternative to prednisone in the treatment of mild to moderate acute asthma exacerbations in children, with the added benefits of improved compliance, palatability, and cost. However, more research is needed to examine the role of dexamethasone in hospitalized children.

### Management of asthma and COPD exacerbations in adults in the ICU [^112QgzPX]. CHEST Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Corticosteroids

Systemic corticosteroids are an important therapy for severe asthma and COPD exacerbations, and their use is recommended for patients who do not respond to initial bronchodilator therapy (Table 2). Interestingly, although corticosteroids are recommended for both diseases, their benefit in COPD exacerbations seems to be driven by a subpopulation with high T2 inflammation and elevated eosinophil counts, drawing interest in using eosinophil levels to guide steroid administration among patients who are not critically ill.–

Strong evidence supports corticosteroids for asthma and COPD exacerbations treated in the acute care setting. – Few studies have evaluated corticosteroids in adult patients who are critically ill with asthma exacerbations, particularly those necessitating mechanical ventilation. For COPD exacerbations requiring mechanical ventilation (either noninvasive ventilation [NIV] or invasive mechanical ventilation [IMV]), one study found that corticosteroids were associated with a reduction in duration of IMV and rate of NIV failure, whereas another study found no difference in outcomes.

Among patients managed in acute care settings, the recommended regimen is prednisone 1 mg/kg/d up to 50 mg/d or equivalent for 5 to 7 days for asthma and prednisone 40 mg/d for 5 days for COPD based on studies showing shorter courses (5–7 days vs 10–14 days) resulted in similar rates of treatment failure and relapse with reduced risk of pneumonia and death.– Of the few studies conducted in patients who are critically ill, most used higher doses. However, very high doses (ie, methylprednisolone > 240 mg/d) have been associated with increased treatment failure, duration of IMV, ICU and hospital length of stay (LOS), and adverse events, including hyperglycemia requiring insulin therapy and fungal infections. Currently evidence to suggest routine use of higher corticosteroid doses is limited, and we recommend prednisone 40 to 50 mg/d for at least 5 days with consideration of higher doses in patients with life-threatening disease or those not responding to initial therapy.

### Systemic corticosteroid therapy for acute asthma exacerbations [^116LH4cE]. The Journal of Asthma (2006). Low credibility.

Acute exacerbations of asthma may represent reactions to airway irritants or failures of chronic treatment. The costs to both the patient and society are high. Exacerbations often are frightening episodes that can cause significant morbidity and sometimes death. The emergency department (ED) visits and hospitalizations often required lead to significant health care expenses. Thus, preventing and optimizing management of acute exacerbations is critical. Corticosteroids are a cornerstone of asthma therapy. They have been shown to lower admission rates and reduce risk of relapse. This article provides an overview of the role of corticosteroids (including betamethasone, dexamethasone, methylprednisolone, and prednisolone) in the management of acute asthma exacerbations, with an aim toward effective decision making about the choice of therapy.

### Dexamethasone versus prednisone for pediatric acute asthma exacerbations: specialists' practice patterns [^111vAvKM]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Background and Objective

Dexamethasone has emerged as a viable alternative to prednisone in the treatment of pediatric acute asthma exacerbations, with the potential for improved compliance secondary to decreased frequency of dosing, improved taste, and decreased cost. The objective of this study is to identify whether providers are prescribing dexamethasone for pediatric acute asthma exacerbations. Secondary objectives are to describe variation in practice between different specialties and to identify the commonly used dosing and frequency for dexamethasone.

Methods

We conducted a cross-sectional, descriptive study with an anonymous, web-based survey (surveymonkey.com). The survey population included all fellowship program directors listed on FRIEDA Online for pediatric emergency medicine, pediatric pulmonology, and allergy and immunology, and emergency medicine residency directors through the Council of Emergency Medicine Residency Directors listserv. Program directors were contacted via e-mail up to 5 times for 3 months.

Results

Overall, 300 respondents (70% of the program directors) completed the survey. Response rates by specialty varied from 60% to 94%. One third of providers are using dexamethasone, whereas just more than half of providers (51%) are prescribing a 5-day prednisone course. The preferred maximum dose for dexamethasone is 10 mg (45%), with 82% using a dose of 0.6 mg/kg. Pediatric emergency medicine fellowship directors demonstrated a preference for dexamethasone (59%). Prednisone is favored by emergency medicine (56%), pediatric pulmonology (89%), and allergy and immunology (93%) program directors.

Conclusions

Although most pediatric emergency medicine academic physicians have transitioned to using dexamethasone to treat acute pediatric asthma exacerbations, other specialties continue to favor prednisone.

### Randomized trial of dexamethasone versus prednisone for children with acute asthma exacerbations [^1152CnrF]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine whether 2 doses of dexamethasone is as effective as 5 days of prednisolone/prednisone therapy in improving symptoms and quality of life of children with asthma exacerbations admitted to the emergency department (ED).

Study Design

We conducted a randomized, noninferiority trial including patients aged 1–14 years who presented to the ED with acute asthma to compare the efficacy of 2 doses of dexamethasone (0.6mg/kg/dose, experimental treatment) vs a 5-day course of prednisolone/prednisone (1.5mg/kg/d, followed by 1mg/kg/d on days 2–5, conventional treatment). Two follow-up telephone interviews were completed at 7 and 15 days. The primary outcome measures were the percentage of patients with asthma symptoms and quality of life at day 7. Secondary outcomes were unscheduled returns, admissions, adherence, and vomiting.

Results

During the study period, 710 children who met the inclusion criteria were invited to participate and 590 agreed. Primary outcome data were available in 557 patients. At day 7, experimental and conventional groups did not show differences related to persistence of symptoms (56.6%, 95% CI 50.6–62.6 vs 58.3%, 95% CI 52.3–64.2, respectively), quality of life score (80.0 vs 77.7, not significant [ns]), admission rate (23.9% vs 21.7%, ns), unscheduled ED return visits (4.6% vs 3.3%, ns), and vomiting (2.1% vs 4.4%, ns). Adherence was greater in the dexamethasone group (99.3% vs 96.0%, P < .05).

Conclusion

Two doses of dexamethasone may be an effective alternative to a 5-day course of prednisone/prednisolone for asthma exacerbations, as measured by persistence of symptoms and quality of life at day 7.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^112MXZew]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Oral corticosteroids in children with severe exacerbations — A dose of oral corticosteroids (OCS) equivalent to prednisolone 1–2 mg/kg/day, with a maximum of 20 mg/day for children under 2 years of age and 30 mg/day for children aged 2–5 years, is currently recommended (Evidence A). Several studies have failed to show any benefits when OCS are given earlier during periods of worsening wheeze managed in an outpatient setting, whereas a meta-analysis demonstrated a reduced risk of hospitalization when OCS were administered in the emergency department, but no clear benefit when given in the outpatient setting. A course of 3–5 days is sufficient in most children of this age and can be stopped without tapering, but the child must be reviewed after discharge to confirm recovery. In children discharged from the emergency department, an intramuscular corticosteroid may be an alternative to a course of OCS for preventing relapse, but the risk of long-term adverse effects must be considered and there is insufficient evidence to recommend intramuscular over oral corticosteroids.

### Inhaled corticosteroids for asthma: common clinical quandaries [^113K8Ar4]. The Journal of Asthma (2003). Low credibility.

This narrative review provides evidence-based explanations to some of the common clinical concerns regarding inhaled corticosteroids. Inhaled corticosteroids are the treatment of choice for a newly diagnosed asthmatic patient. Better results are obtained when treatment is initiated as soon as the diagnosis is made. Asthma control can be achieved and maintained in most patients with a low or moderate dose of inhaled corticosteroid administered in two daily doses. Longer duration of treatment provides more sustained benefits than treatment that is intermittent and for short periods of time. The clinical benefits can be observed within 24 hours of commencing treatment and may be more pronounced in patients with an eosinophilic bronchitis. Inhaled corticosteroids provide additional benefit when used in conjunction with prednisone in acute severe asthma. Low doses do not have clinically deleterious side effects on the bones, growth, eye, or hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal-axis. However, they do not normalize lung function and prevent structural changes in the airway wall in all asthmatic patients.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^116KTsTS]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Treatment in acute care settings — systemic corticosteroids — Systemic corticosteroids speed resolution of exacerbations and prevent relapse, and in acute care settings should be utilized in all but the mildest exacerbations in adults, adolescents and children 6–11 years (Evidence A). Where possible, systemic corticosteroids should be administered to the patient within 1 hour of presentation. Use of systemic corticosteroids is particularly important in the emergency department if initial SABA treatment fails to achieve lasting improvement in symptoms, the exacerbation developed while the patient was taking OCS, or the patient has a history of previous exacerbations requiring OCS. For route of delivery, oral administration is as effective as intravenous, the oral route is preferred because it is quicker, less invasive and less expensive, and OCS require at least 4 hours to produce a clinical improvement.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^115vEybj]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) — in the emergency department, high-dose ICS given within the first hour after presentation reduces the need for hospitalization in patients not receiving systemic corticosteroids (Evidence A); when added to systemic corticosteroids, evidence is conflicting in adults, and in children early ICS with or without systemic corticosteroids might reduce hospital admission and need for systemic corticosteroids (Evidence B). Overall, add-on ICS are well tolerated, but the agent, dose and duration remain unclear and cost may be significant; patients admitted to hospital for an asthma exacerbation should continue on, or be prescribed, ICS-containing therapy. On discharge home, patients should be prescribed ongoing ICS-containing treatment because severe exacerbation is a risk factor for future exacerbations (Evidence B) and ICS-containing medications significantly reduce asthma-related death or hospitalization (Evidence A); SABA-only treatment of asthma is no longer recommended, and adding ICS to systemic corticosteroids after discharge showed no significant short-term benefit, though post-discharge ICS were as effective as systemic corticosteroids for milder exacerbations with wide confidence limits.

### Short-term vs conventional glucocorticoid therapy in acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: the REDUCE randomized clinical trial [^113xqzFL]. JAMA (2013). Excellent credibility.

Importance

International guidelines advocate a 7- to 14-day course of systemic glucocorticoid therapy in acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, the optimal dose and duration are unknown.

Objective

To investigate whether a short-term (5 days) systemic glucocorticoid treatment in patients with COPD exacerbation is noninferior to conventional (14 days) treatment in clinical outcome and whether it decreases the exposure to steroids. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS REDUCE: (Reduction in the Use of Corticosteroids in Exacerbated COPD), a randomized, noninferiority multicenter trial in 5 Swiss teaching hospitals, enrolling 314 patients presenting to the emergency department with acute COPD exacerbation, past or present smokers (≥ 20 pack-years) without a history of asthma, from March 2006 through February 2011.

Interventions

Treatment with 40 mg of prednisone daily for either 5 or 14 days in a placebo-controlled, double-blind fashion. The predefined noninferiority criterion was an absolute increase in exacerbations of at most 15%, translating to a critical hazard ratio of 1.515 for a reference event rate of 50%.

Main Outcome and Measure

Time to next exacerbation within 180 days.

Results

Of 314 randomized patients, 289 (92%) of whom were admitted to the hospital, 311 were included in the intention-to-treat analysis and 296 in the per-protocol analysis. Hazard ratios for the short-term vs conventional treatment group were 0.95 (90% CI, 0.70 to 1.29; P = 0.006 for noninferiority) in the intention-to-treat analysis and 0.93 (90% CI, 0.68 to 1.26; P = 0.005 for noninferiority) in the per-protocol analysis, meeting our noninferiority criterion. In the short-term group, 56 patients (35.9%) reached the primary end point; 57 (36.8%) in the conventional group. Estimates of reexacerbation rates within 180 days were 37.2% (95% CI, 29.5% to 44.9%) in the short-term; 38.4% (95% CI, 30.6% to 46.3%) in the conventional, with a difference of -1.2% (95% CI, -12.2% to 9.8%) between the short-term and the conventional. Among patients with a reexacerbation, the median time to event was 43.5 days (interquartile range [IQR], 13 to 118) in the short-term and 29 days (IQR, 16 to 85) in the conventional. There was no difference between groups in time to death, the combined end point of exacerbation, death, or both and recovery of lung function. In the conventional group, mean cumulative prednisone dose was significantly higher (793 mg [95% CI, 710 to 876 mg] vs 379 mg [95% CI, 311 to 446 mg], P < .001), but treatment-associated adverse reactions, including hyperglycemia and hypertension, did not occur more frequently.

Conclusions and Relevance

In patients presenting to the emergency department with acute exacerbations of COPD, 5-day treatment with systemic glucocorticoids was noninferior to 14-day treatment with regard to reexacerbation within 6 months of follow-up but significantly reduced glucocorticoid exposure. These findings support the use of a 5-day glucocorticoid treatment in acute exacerbations of COPD.

### Prednisolone in children with respiratory disease… [^116u8M1n]. AAFP (2004). Low credibility.

Csonka and associates used a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the use of oral prednisolone in children with acute respiratory distress. Participants ranged from six to 35 months of age, with acute tachypnea representing an apparent viral respiratory infection. Children were excluded from the study if they had a diagnosis of asthma or chronic pulmonary disease, or multiple prior episodes of wheezing. The outcomes measured included exacerbation of symptoms, hospital length of stay, and duration of symptoms. The participants received a placebo or oral prednisolone in two divided doses for three days after an initial dose of 2 mg per kg in the emergency department. Patients were hospitalized if they continued to wheeze despite two doses of inhaled albuterol. Hospitalized patients continued using inhaled albuterol and may have received additional corticosteroids if deemed necessary by the treating physician.

Treating five patients with oral prednisolone prevented one child from needing additional asthma rescue medication, one child from requiring longer hospitalization, and one child from having symptoms lasting three or more days. The need for hospitalization was not affected by oral prednisolone treatment. Independent effect analysis showed that placebo use was an independent risk factor for the need for additional medication and longer hospitalization. Reported adverse reactions were mild and resolved spontaneously. First-time wheezers were less likely to require additional asthma medication. The authors conclude that, in children six to 35 months of age with viral-induced respiratory distress, oral prednisolone reduces the need for additional medications and reduces the length of symptoms.

In an editorial in the same issue, Weinberger explains the variation in study conclusions relating to the value of corticosteroids in the treatment of bronchiolitis by timing of the first dose of corticosteroids or the dosages used. He concludes that early administration of a high dose of corticosteroids is probably appropriate to decrease the hospitalization rate. The use of bronchodilators also may provide some benefit. If bronchodilator response is good, it should be continued, along with a short course of steroids. Supportive measures such as adequate oxygenation and hydration remain the uncontroversial aspects of bronchiolitis care.

### Increased versus stable doses of inhaled corticosteroids for exacerbations of chronic asthma in adults and children [^114zfvwz]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Written action plans providing guidance in the early treatment of asthma exacerbations have traditionally advocated doubling of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) as one of the first steps in treatment.

Objectives

To compare the clinical effectiveness of increasing the dose of ICS versus keeping the usual maintenance dose as part of a patient-initiated action plan at the onset of asthma exacerbations.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register (last search October 2009) which is derived from searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL, as well as handsearched respiratory journals and meeting abstracts.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared the strategy of increasing the daily dose of ICS to continuing the same ICS dose in the home management of asthma exacerbations in children or adults with persistent asthma on daily maintenance ICS.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected trials, assessed quality and extracted data. We contacted authors of RCTs for additional information.

Main Results

Five RCTs (four parallel-group and one cross-over) involving a total of 1250 patients (28 children and 1222 adults) with mild to moderate asthma were included. The mean daily baseline ICS dose was 555 mg (range 200 mg to 795 mg) and the mean daily ICS dose achieved following increase was 1520 mg (range 1000 mg to 2075 mg), in CFC beclomethasone dipropionate equivalents. Three parallel-group studies in adults (two doubling and one quadrupling; mean achieved daily dose of 1695 mg with a range of 1420 to 2075 mg), involving 1080 patients contributed data to the primary outcome. There was no significant reduction in the need for rescue oral corticosteroids when patients were randomised to the increased ICS compared to stable maintenance dose groups (OR 0.85, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.26). There was no significant difference in the overall risk of non-serious adverse events associated with the increased ICS dose strategy, but the wide confidence interval prevents a firm conclusion. No serious adverse events were reported.

Authors' Conclusions

There is very little evidence from trials in children. In adults with asthma on daily maintenance ICS, a self-initiated ICS increase to 1000 to 2000 mcg/day at the onset of an exacerbation is not associated with a statistically significant reduction in the risk of exacerbations requiring rescue oral corticosteroids. More research is needed to assess the effectiveness of increased ICS doses at the onset of asthma exacerbations (particularly in children).

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^1135kseN]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Inhaled corticosteroids during exacerbation — dosing and effects in children: For children not previously on ICS, an initial dose of ICS twice the low daily dose may be given and continued for a few weeks or months; some studies have used high-dose ICS (1600 mcg/day, preferably divided into four doses over the day and given for 5–10 days) as this may reduce the need for OCS, but addition of ICS to standard care (including OCS) does not reduce risk of hospitalization while reducing length of stay and acute asthma scores in children in the emergency department, and the potential for side-effects with high-dose ICS should be considered with close monitoring. For those children already on ICS, doubling the dose was not effective in a small study of mild-moderate exacerbations in children aged 6–14 years, nor was quintupling the dose in children aged 5–11 years with good adherence; this approach should be reserved mainly for individual cases and should always involve regular follow-up and monitoring of adverse effects.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^1157R5if]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Box 9–5 — discharge medications after acute care for asthma advises to initiate inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)-containing treatment if not already being taken; for adults/adolescents, maintenance-and-reliever therapy with ICS–formoterol (MART) is preferred and, for adults/adolescents, start MART at Step 4 on discharge; if prescribing an ICS regimen with short-acting beta2-agonist (SABA) reliever, step the maintenance dose up for 2–4 weeks and emphasize adherence and inhaler technique. To reduce relapse risk, prescribe at least a 5–7 day course of oral corticosteroids (OCS) for adults (prednisolone or equivalent 40–50 mg/day) and 3–5 days for children (1–2 mg/kg/day to a maximum of 40 mg/day) (Evidence A); review progress before ceasing OCS, and if the OCS is dexamethasone, treatment is only for total 1–2 days, with switching to prednisolone considered if there is failure of resolution or relapse of symptoms.

### A review of prednisolone prescribing for children with acute asthma in the UK [^112DKbTt]. The Journal of Asthma (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Worldwide asthma guidelines recommend short courses of oral prednisolone in children with acute exacerbations generating high prescription numbers. There is a paucity of evidence to inform the optimal dose and course duration. This has led to a variation in the recommendations for prednisolone prescribing. Our objective was to assess prednisolone prescribing practise for children with acute asthma in a representative sample of UK prescribers.

Methods

We developed an online questionnaire asking prescribers the prednisolone dosage, course duration and formulation used, whether they discussed oral prednisolone side effects with the family and at what child's age they changed from prescribing soluble to non-soluble formulations. This was sent to 1006 UK prescribers including Paediatric Respiratory Consultants, doctors in training, asthma nurses and General Practitioners.

Results

200 complete responses were received (response rate 20%). The majority of surveyed prescribers follow the British National Formulary for Children recommendations on dosage rather than those included in the British Thoracic Society and the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network. Despite this, we highlighted a 4-fold variation in prednisolone dosages for acute asthma. The majority of prescribers chose 3 days as the course duration. High use of soluble formulations was highlighted.

Conclusions

There is wide variation in the dose of prednisolone prescribed for children with acute asthma in the UK. This reflects a relative lack of evidence that needs addressing.

### Parent initiated prednisolone for acute asthma in children of school age: randomised controlled crossover trial [^115CyE3w]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Episodes of acute asthma were defined by the following advice given to parents: "If from previous experience you suspect this is a more severe attack, or if the symptoms are not getting better in about 6 to 8 hours with regular use of reliever medication, give your child the study medication immediately". Parents were instructed to continue to administer the study medication for three to five days depending on the persistence or resolution of their child's asthma symptoms. To ensure an adequate washout period and that the episodes were discrete, parents were instructed not to commence a course of study medicine until a minimum of 14 days after starting the previous treatment and seven days after stopping a previous course of study medication or oral corticosteroids. Parents were instructed not to increase the dose of inhaled corticosteroid (if applicable) during an exacerbation.

During the enrolment process, a personalised asthma management plan was developed for each participant in accordance with the local asthma management guidelines. We sought to ensure that the use or non-use of any additional asthma preventive medications was appropriate, that an appropriate drug delivery device was being used effectively, that there was a sound understanding of dosing (including the fact that for children older than 6 years it was appropriate to deliver up to 12 actuations (1200 μg) of salbutamol at a time), and that the families understood the criteria for seeking a medical review. Parents were instructed to seek a medical review: (1) if their child had a bad attack or they were worried; (2) if their child needed salbutamol more than every 3 hours; (3) if their child was getting little or no relief from salbutamol; or (4) if wheezing lasted more than 24 hours and was not getting better.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^115sPaLx]. GINA (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for asthma, more specifically with respect to management of exacerbation, emergency department setting, systemic corticosteroids, GINA 2025 guidelines recommend to recognize that there is no need to taper the dose of oral corticosteroids, either in the short term or over several weeks, in patients on maintenance ICSs.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^115zSY4A]. GINA (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for asthma, more specifically with respect to management of exacerbation, emergency department setting, systemic corticosteroids, GINA 2025 guidelines recommend to recognize that oral dexamethasone (12–16 mg once daily in adults and 0.3–0.6 mg/kg once daily in children for 1–2 days) has also been studied, showing similar efficacy to 3–5 days of oral prednisolone, with better adherence and a significantly lower risk of vomiting.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^115Sbu4q]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Asthma exacerbations in primary or acute care for children 5 years and younger — assess severity while starting SABA and oxygen: "SABA (2–6 puffs every 20 minutes for first hour) and oxygen (to maintain saturation 94–98%)". Recommend escalation and transfer criteria: "Recommend immediate transfer to hospital if there is no response to inhaled SABA within 1–2 hours;… respiratory rate > 40/minute… or if oxygen saturation is < 92% on room air". Systemic corticosteroid options and dosing include: "Consider oral prednisolone/prednisone 1–2 mg/kg/day… up to a maximum of 20 mg/day for children aged 0–2 years, and 30 mg/day for children aged 3–5 years, for up to 5 days; or dexamethasone 0.6 mg/kg/day for 2 days". If relapse or non‑resolution occurs with dexamethasone, "consideration should be given to switching to prednisolone". Note measurement caution: "oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry may be overestimated in people with dark skin color".

### Primary care provider preferences for glucocorticoid management of acute asthma exacerbations in children [^116pvstB]. The Journal of Asthma (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

Primary care providers (PCP) frequently care for children with acute asthma exacerbations in the outpatient setting. The objective of this study is to evaluate PCP preferences and perceptions regarding oral glucocorticoids prescribed from both outpatient primary care and ED settings for the treatment of children with acute asthma exacerbations.

Methods

PCPs belonging to the Colorado Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics were surveyed between February and May 2019. Survey items were generated by a multidisciplinary team and underwent content and criteria validation and pilot testing. Survey items evaluated PCP preferred oral glucocorticoid and dosing regimen for children with acute asthma exacerbations, provider- and patient-level factors contributing to glucocorticoid preferences, and perception of glucocorticoid regimens in terms of treatment failure, resolution of symptoms and adherence.

Results

A total of 109 of 600 (18.2%) PCPs responded. Equal proportions of PCPs reported preferring oral prednisone/prednisolone (50.5%) and oral dexamethasone (49.5%) for children with acute asthma exacerbations. Forty-four percent of PCPs reported no preference in type of glucocorticoid utilized by surrounding emergency departments (EDs). However, for children receiving dexamethasone in the ED but with persistent symptoms on PCP follow-up, 50.5% of PCPs would switch patients to prednisone/prednisolone. PCPs did not perceive more treatment failure or rapid resolution of symptoms with dexamethasone but reported better adherence with dexamethasone.

Conclusion

There is variability in PCP glucocorticoid management of pediatric acute asthma exacerbations. There is a need for further investigations to evaluate for differences in clinical outcomes based on PCP glucocorticoid treatment choices.

### Corticosteroids for preventing relapse following acute exacerbations of asthma [^11765Qen]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Acute asthma is responsible for many emergency department visits annually. Between 12–16% will relapse to require additional interventions within two weeks of ED discharge. Treatment of acute asthma is based on rapid reversal of bronchospasm and reducing airway inflammation and this review examines the evidence for using systemic corticosteroids to improve outcomes after discharge from the ED.

Objectives

To determine the benefit of corticosteroids (oral, intramuscular, or intravenous) for the treatment of asthmatic patients discharged from an acute care setting (i.e. usually the emergency department) after assessment and treatment of an acute asthmatic exacerbation.

Search Strategy

The Cochrane Airways Group "Asthma and Wheez* RCT" register was searched using the terms: a) Asthma OR Wheez* b) Glucocorticoid OR Steroid* AND c) Exacerbat* OR Relapse* OR Emerg*. In addition, authors of all included studies were contacted to determine if unpublished studies which met the inclusion criteria were available. Bibliographies from included studies, known reviews and texts were also searched for additional citations.

Selection Criteria

Only randomized controlled trials were eligible for selection. Studies were included in this review if they dealt with the outpatient treatment of asthmatic exacerbations using glucocorticoids at discharge and reported either relapse rate or PFTs. Two independent reviewers first identified potentially relevant studies and then selected articles for inclusion. Methodological quality was assessed independently by two reviewers. Agreement was assessed using kappa (k) statistics.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were extracted independently by two reviewers; authors were contacted to verify the extracted data and clarify missing information. When author contact was unsuccessful, missing data were estimated from graphs where possible. Sensitivity, sub-group and overall analyses were performed using the Cochrane Review Manager.

Main Results

A search that yielded 229 references identified 169 (73%) original publications. Reviewers identified 8 studies for potential inclusion (k = 0.76); 18 references were added by searching publication reference lists and contact with authors. Of these 26 articles, a total of 7 were included in the overview. Two studies used intramuscular corticosteroids, five studies used oral corticosteroids. Significantly fewer patients in the corticosteroid group relapsed to receive additional care in the first week (odds ratio (OR) 0.35; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.17, 0.73). This favourable effect was maintained over the first 21 days (OR 0.33; 95% CI: 0.13, 0.82). Patients receiving corticosteroids had less need for beta-agonists (weighted mean difference (WMD) -3.3 activations/day; 95% CI: -5.5, -1.0). Changes in pulmonary function tests (SMD 0.045; 95% CI: -0.47, 0.56) and side effects (SMD 0.03; 95% CI: -0.38, 0.44) in the first 7–10 days, while rarely reported, showed no differences between the treatment groups. Statistically significant heterogeneity was identified for the side effect results; all other outcomes were homogeneous. It appears that IM corticosteroids are similarly efficacious to a 7–10 day tapering course of oral agents. From these results, as few as 13 patients need to be treated to prevent relapse to additional care after an exacerbation of asthma.

Reviewer's Conclusions

A short course of corticosteroids following assessment for an acute exacerbation of asthma significantly reduces the number of relapses to additional care and decreases beta-agonist use without an apparent increase in side effects. Intramuscular corticosteroids appear as effective as oral agents.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^114QTrxX]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Acute asthma exacerbation — oral corticosteroids (OCS) course and risks: OCS should usually be continued for 5–7 days in adults and 3–5 days in children, and patients should be advised about common short‑term side-effects including sleep disturbance, increased appetite, reflux and mood changes. In adults, the risk of sepsis and thromboembolism is also increased after a short course of OCS, and use of 4–5 lifetime courses in adults is associated with a dose‑dependent increased risk of long‑term adverse effects such as osteoporosis, fractures, diabetes, heart failure and cataract. This emphasizes the importance of optimizing asthma management after any severe exacerbation to reduce the risk of further exacerbations.

### Interventions for escalation of therapy for acute exacerbations of asthma in children: an overview of cochrane reviews [^1119mi5A]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Asthma is an illness that commonly affects adults and children, and it serves as a common reason for children to attend emergency departments. An asthma exacerbation is characterised by acute or subacute worsening of shortness of breath, cough, wheezing, and chest tightness and may be triggered by viral respiratory infection, poor compliance with usual medication, a change in the weather, or exposure to allergens or irritants. Most children with asthma have mild or moderate exacerbations and respond well to first-line therapy (inhaled short-acting beta-agonists and systemic corticosteroids). However, the best treatment for the small proportion of seriously ill children who do not respond to first-line therapy is not well understood. Currently, a large number of treatment options are available and there is wide variation in management.

Objectives

Main objective - To summarise Cochrane Reviews with or without meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials on the efficacy and safety of second-line treatment for children with acute exacerbations of asthma (i.e. after first-line treatments, titrated oxygen delivery, and administration of intermittent inhaled short-acting beta 2 -agonists and oral corticosteroids have been tried and have failed) Secondary objectives - To identify gaps in the current evidence base that will inform recommendations for future research and subsequent Cochrane Reviews - To categorise information on reported outcome measures used in trials of escalation of treatment for acute exacerbations of asthma in children, and to make recommendations for development and reporting of standard outcomes in future trials and reviews - To identify relevant randomised controlled trials that have been published since the date of publication of each included review METHODS: We included Cochrane Reviews assessing interventions for children with acute exacerbations of asthma. We searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. The search is current to 28 December 2019. We also identified trials that were potentially eligible for, but were not currently included in, published reviews. We assessed the quality of included reviews using the ROBIS criteria (tool used to assess risk of bias in systematic reviews). We presented an evidence synthesis of data from reviews alongside an evidence map of clinical trials. Primary outcomes were length of stay, hospital admission, intensive care unit admission, and adverse effects. We summarised all findings in the text and reported data for each outcome in 'Additional tables'.

Main Results

We identified 17 potentially eligible Cochrane Reviews but extracted data from, and rated the quality of, 13 reviews that reported results for children alone. We excluded four reviews as one did not include any randomised controlled trials (RCTs), one did not provide subgroup data for children, and the last two had been updated and replaced by subsequent reviews. The 13 reviews included 67 trials; the number of trials in each review ranged from a single trial up to 27 trials. The vast majority of comparisons included between one and three trials, involving fewer than 100 participants. The total number of participants included in reviews ranged from 40 to 2630. All studies included children; 16 (24%) included children younger than two years of age. Most of the reviews reported search dates older than four years. We have summarised the published evidence as outlined in Cochrane Reviews. Key findings, in terms of our primary outcomes, are that (1) intravenous magnesium sulfate was the only intervention shown to reduce hospital length of stay (high-certainty evidence); (2) no evidence suggested that any intervention reduced the risk of intensive care admission (low- to very low-certainty evidence); (3) the risk of hospital admission was reduced by the addition of inhaled anticholinergic agents to inhaled beta 2 -agonists (moderate-certainty evidence), the use of intravenous magnesium sulfate (high-certainty evidence), and the use of inhaled heliox (low-certainty evidence); (4) the addition of inhaled magnesium sulfate to usual bronchodilator therapy appears to reduce serious adverse events during hospital admission (moderate-certainty evidence); (5) aminophylline increased vomiting compared to placebo (moderate-certainty evidence) and increased nausea and nausea/vomiting compared to intravenous beta 2 -agonists (low-certainty evidence); and (6) the addition of anticholinergic therapy to short-acting beta 2 -agonists appeared to reduce the risk of nausea (high-certainty evidence) and tremor (moderate-certainty evidence) but not vomiting (low-certainty evidence). We considered 4 of the 13 reviews to be at high risk of bias based on the ROBIS framework. In all cases, this was due to concerns regarding identification and selection of studies. The certainty of evidence varied widely (by review and also by outcome) and ranged from very low to high.

Authors' Conclusions

This overview provides the most up-to-date evidence on interventions for escalation of therapy for acute exacerbations of asthma in children from Cochrane Reviews of randomised controlled trials. A vast majority of comparisons involved between one and three trials and fewer than 100 participants, making it difficult to assess the balance between benefits and potential harms. Due to the lack of comparative studies between various treatment options, we are unable to make firm practice recommendations. Intravenous magnesium sulfate appears to reduce both hospital length of stay and the risk of hospital admission. Hospital admission is also reduced with the addition of inhaled anticholinergic agents to inhaled beta 2 -agonists. However, further research is required to determine which patients are most likely to benefit from these therapies. Due to the relatively rare incidence of acute severe paediatric asthma, multi-centre research will be required to generate high-quality evidence. A number of existing Cochrane Reviews should be updated, and we recommend that a new review be conducted on the use of high-flow nasal oxygen therapy. Important priorities include development of an internationally agreed core outcome set for future trials in acute severe asthma exacerbations and determination of clinically important differences in these outcomes, which can then inform adequately powered future trials.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: a Report from the national asthma education and prevention program coordinating committee expert panel working group [^112hxQuZ]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). High credibility.

Intermittent inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) dosing — operational definitions for this section are as follows: Intermittent ICS dosing includes courses of ICS treatment used for brief periods, usually in response to symptoms or as an add-on with or without a long-acting beta2-agonist (LABA), and does not refer to a single regimen with its definition specified in each recommendation; controller therapy refers to medications taken daily on a long-term basis to achieve and maintain control of persistent asthma; the terms ICS-LABA and ICS-formoterol indicate combination therapy with both an ICS and a LABA, usually and preferably in a single inhaler; quick-relief therapy refers to medications such as an inhaled short-acting beta2-agonist (SABA) used to treat acute symptoms or exacerbations, and in this section as-needed dosing is intermittent and based on the patient's decision; the definitions of low-, medium-, and high-dose ICS are based on EPR-3; a puff refers to a single actuation and inhalation; and recurrent wheezing is defined as three or more episodes of wheezing triggered by apparent respiratory tract infections in a child's lifetime or two episodes in the past year.

### European Society of Endocrinology and endocrine society joint clinical guideline: diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^112yXkR9]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Short-term glucocorticoid therapy is commonly used for conditions such as exacerbation of asthma, chronic obstructive lung disease, inflammatory bowel disease, allergic skin reactions, and rheumatoid arthritis. In a United States insurance database study of 1.5 million adults, 21% had received at least one course of oral glucocorticoids during the last three years, with a median dose of 20 mg prednisone equivalent and a median duration of 6 days. A starting dose of 50 mg of prednisone tapering to zero within 5–7 or 10–14 days are typical treatment regimens for exacerbation of asthma (Global Strategy for Asthma Management and Prevention.).

There is no evidence that such short treatment periods lead to clinically relevant suppression of HPA axis, although there is lack of large high-quality studies. Suppression as evaluated by a 1 µg ACTH (1–24)-test has been reported. However, this test is less validated than a 250 µg ACTH (1–24)-test and should be interpreted with caution. While adrenal insufficiency is unlikely after short-term glucocorticoid therapy, clinicians should be aware that even short-term glucocorticoid treatment can lead to complications such as increased incidence of sepsis, gastrointestinal bleeding, thromboembolism, and fractures.

R 2.2 — Glucocorticoid taper for patients on long-term glucocorticoid therapy should only be attempted if the underlying disease for which glucocorticoids were prescribed is controlled, and glucocorticoids are no longer required. In these cases, glucocorticoids are tapered until approaching the physiologic daily dose equivalent is achieved (eg, 4–6 mg prednisone). (Good clinical practice)

SECTION IV: RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE USE OF INTERMITTENT ICS IN THE TREATMENT OF ASTHMA

Background

Scheduled, daily ICS treatment is the currently preferred pharmacologic controller therapy for persistent asthma in individuals of all ages. Expert Panel Report 3: Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Asthma (EPR-3), published in 2007, suggested that intermittent ICS dosing schedules may be useful in some settings, but the evidence at that time was insufficient to support a recommendation in favor of this treatment beyond a recommendation based on expert consensus.

Definitions of terms used in this section

"Intermittent" ICS dosing in this section includes courses of ICS treatment used for brief periods, usually in response to symptoms or as an add-on with or without a LABA. "Intermittent ICS dosing" does not refer to a single regimen, and its definition is specified in each of the recommendations. Intermittent ICS dosing allows providers to prescribe specific doses, frequencies, and durations of ICS use. When to use intermittent ICS dosing could depend on an individual's decision (based on need, which is also known as "as-needed" or "pro re nata" dosing), a predefined index showing worsening asthma, or some other predefined criterion.

"Controller therapy" refers to medications that are taken daily on a long-term basis to achieve and maintain control of persistent asthma. Both controller therapy and intermittent dosing may involve daily use of a specific dose of an ICS. The terms "ICS-LABA" (inhaled corticosteroid and long-acting beta 2 -agonist combination, typically in a single device) and "ICS-formoterol" indicate combination therapy with both an ICS and a LABA, usually and preferably in a single inhaler.

"Quick-relief" therapy refers to medications (eg, an inhaled SABA) used to treat acute symptoms or exacerbations. In this section, "as-needed" dosing (eg, of a SABA) is intermittent and is based on the patient's decision (Figs 2–4).

The definitions of "low-", "medium-", and "high-dose" ICS are based on the recommendations from EPR-3.

The term "puff" refers to a single actuation and inhalation of a medication delivered through any type of inhaler.

"Recurrent wheezing" as used for the studies included in this section is defined as three or more episodes of wheezing triggered by apparent respiratory tract infections in a child's lifetime or two episodes in the past year.

### Randomized trial of single-dose intramuscular dexamethasone compared with prednisolone for children with acute asthma [^111goPHF]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2007). Low credibility.

Objectives

To compare the clinical efficacy of single-dose intramuscular (IM) dexamethasone phosphate to a 5-day course of oral prednisolone for the treatment of moderate asthma exacerbations in young children discharged from the emergency department (ED).

Methods

We performed a prospective, randomized trial in children aged 18 months to less than 7 years with asthma who presented to the ED with a clinical asthma score of 3 to 7 on a 9-point scale. Children were randomized to 1 dose of IM dexamethasone (0.6 mg/kg, maximum 15 mg) or oral prednisolone (2 mg/kg, maximum 50 mg) once daily for 5 days. The primary outcome, measured only for patients discharged from the ED, was change in asthma score from ED presentation to 4-day follow-up examination, as assessed by a physician masked to group assignment. We assessed secondary clinical course outcomes by a structured interview at 4 and 14 days.

Results

Eighty-eight patients were appropriately randomized to dexamethasone and 93 to prednisolone. Group characteristics were similar at baseline. Among those discharged from the ED, 62 (90%) of 69 and 64 (90%) of 74 patients in the dexamethasone and prednisolone groups, respectively, were reassessed at 4 days for the primary outcome. The mean change in total asthma score at 4-day follow-up was 3.6 in the dexamethasone group and 3.4 in the prednisolone group (difference, 0.2; 95% confidence interval, -0.4 to 0.7). Of patients initially discharged, 5.9% of dexamethasone patients and 4.1% of prednisolone patients were admitted before the 2-week follow-up (difference, 1.8%; 95% confidence interval, -5.4% to 9.0%).

Conclusions

A single dose of IM dexamethasone showed no clinically meaningful difference in outcomes compared with a 5-day course of oral prednisolone for the treatment of moderate acute asthma exacerbations in young children who are discharged from the ED.

### Phenotyping the responses to systemic corticosteroids in the management of asthma attacks (PRISMA): protocol for an observational and translational pilot study [^113xijJb]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2023). High credibility.

The treatable trait success story of chronic asthma certainly makes a case for the reappraisal of our approach to acute asthma. Is it time for precision medicine to attack the problem of asthma attacks? A worthwhile question, considering that corticosteroid toxicities appear after the lifetime equivalent of only four bursts (≥ 1000 mg cumulative dose) of prednisone — that is, four severe asthma attacks — and the increasing levels of resistance to antibiotics observed, mainly due to inadequate prescriptions. Biomarker-guided management could avoid harm to individual patients and society stemming from the inappropriate use of OCs and/or antibiotics due to overuse or without proper consideration of their potential risks and side effects. Simply stated, corticosteroid and antibiotic stewardship can and should be assisted by acute POC testing.

Based on previous knowledge from chronic stable asthma and reports that asthma attacks are heterogeneous events, we hypothesise that treatment responses to OCs in acute asthma vary according to the underlying inflammatory phenotype. Specifically, we speculate that events identified by raised BEC and/or FeNO benefit most from OCs and that events presenting with low type 2 biomarkers have a lesser objective clinical and biological anti-inflammatory response but perhaps higher rates of airway infection or dysfunction. If this proves to be the case, we will be in a solid position to move forward with a randomised clinical trial comparing biomarker-directed OC use with the current 'one-size-fits-all' approach. An important secondary hypothesis of our study is that POC inflammatory and microbiological assessments in acute asthma are possible, acceptable and reliable. The ramifications of such findings would be to plan a clinical trial assessing biomarker-guided asthma attack management in primary care.

### The yellow zone in asthma treatment: is it a gray zone? [^116Ewj7E]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the available literature on methods of preventing and minimizing exacerbations and to target problems for improvement.

Data Sources

PubMed and Cochrane Review searches of the English-language literature using the following key yellow zone terms: asthma exacerbation, self-management plans, inhaled corticosteroids, and acute management of asthma exacerbations.

Study Selection

Articles relevant to our yellow zone intervention inquiry.

Results

The National Institutes of Health (NIH) guidelines advocate that physicians give patients written action plans with instructions on managing home (yellow zone) exacerbations. However, the criteria used to identify the yellow zone are ambiguous and often confusing to patients and physicians. In addition, apart from a passing mention that doubling doses of inhaled corticosteroids may be an option in asthma step-up care, the guidelines contain no recommendations for yellow zone treatment strategies. This deficiency is directly related to the paucity of organized evidence on the efficacy of the various pharmacological interventions that can be used during an exacerbation.

Conclusions

Translating the NIH guidelines into realistic clinical practice requires a clearer and more patient-friendly definition of the yellow zone, and this improved definition will facilitate the prescription of effective interventions in the management of yellow zone exacerbations.

### Adverse behavioral effects of treatment for acute exacerbation of asthma in children: a comparison of two doses of oral steroids [^113wJ5ya]. Chest (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the relative adverse symptomatic effects and benefits of therapy with oral corticosteroids at doses of 2 mg/kg vs 1 mg/kg daily in children with acute exacerbations of asthma.

Methods

Using a questionnaire that addressed symptoms, we conducted a prospective study of the adverse effects and benefits of therapy with prednisone or prednisolone at two dose levels in 86 children who were 2 to 16 years of age with mild persistent asthma during an acute exacerbation and were unresponsive to therapy with inhaled steroids and beta-adrenergic agents. Parents and physicians were blinded to the dose level. Children were assigned to either of the two doses by random allocation. Behavioral side effects were assessed via a questionnaire administered by a physician. Benefits were measured by the resolution of asthma symptoms (cough, shortness of breath, and wheeze) at the completion of the treatment with oral steroids.

Results

Behavioral side effects, particularly anxiety (p < 0.02) and aggressive behavior (p < 0.002), were twice as common in patients receiving a dose of 2 mg/kg/d. Benefits were comparable in the two groups. The number needed to harm (ie, the number of patients receiving experimental treatment that would lead to one additional person being harmed vs patients receiving standard treatment) was 6.1 for anxiety, 8.6 for hyperactivity, and 4.8 for aggressive behavior.

Conclusions

Because the adverse side effects were greater at the higher dose but the benefits were comparable, we recommend using an oral corticosteroid dose of 1 mg/kg daily for children with mild persistent asthma who present with an acute exacerbation of asthma.

### Doubling the dose of budesonide versus maintenance treatment in asthma exacerbations [^114wFKtA]. Thorax (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Previous guidelines recommend doubling the daily dose of maintenance inhaled corticosteroid to treat or prevent progression of exacerbations of asthma.

Methods

Over a 6 month period a cohort of patients were evaluated prospectively and randomised in a double blind controlled trial to treatment with either a continued maintenance dose (MD) of inhaled corticosteroid or doubling the dose (DD) at the time of an exacerbation.

Results

A total of 290 patients were randomised (33% male) and 98 (DD, n = 46) experienced evaluable asthma exacerbations during the study period. Mean (SD) baseline characteristics at randomisation (age 33.5 (14.0) years; forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV(1)) 2.8 (0.7) l; peak expiratory flow (PEF) 422.9 (110.5) l/min) were similar in both groups. In the DD group 41% of patients were considered treatment failures because they either required systemic steroids (n = 12), had an unscheduled visit to a physician (n = 1), or their asthma did not return to baseline (n = 6). This did not differ from the MD group in which 40% were treatment failures (n = 9, 0, and 12, respectively; p = 0.94).

Conclusions

In patients who regularly take an inhaled corticosteroid, doubling the maintenance dose may not affect the pattern of the exacerbation.

### Evaluating the effectiveness of systemic corticosteroids to mitigate relapse in children assessed and treated for acute asthma: a network meta-analysis [^1178rmAj]. The Journal of Asthma (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

The objective of this systematic review was to explore the effectiveness of various systemic corticosteroid (SCS) regimens to mitigate relapse in children with asthma discharged from an acute care setting.

Data Sources

Medline, EMBASE, Global Health, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, EMB ALL, CINAHL, SCOPUS, Proquest Dissertations and Theses Global, and LILACS were searched using controlled vocabulary and key words. Additional citations were searched via clinical trial registries, Google Scholar, bibliographies, a SCOPUS forward search of a sentinel paper, and hand searching conference abstracts.

Study Selection

No limitations based on language, publication status, or year of publication were applied. Two independent reviewers searched to identify randomized controlled trials comparing the effectiveness of SCS regimens to prevent relapse in children following treatment for acute asthma.

Results

Fifteen studies were included. In 3 studies comparing SCS to placebo, asthma relapse was significantly reduced (RR = 0.10; 95% CI: 0.01, 0.77; I² = 0%). A network analysis identified a significant reduction in relapse in children treated with intramuscular corticosteroids (OR = 0.038; 95% CrI: 0.001, 0.397), short-course oral prednisone (OR = 0.054; 95% CrI: 0.002, 0.451), and oral dexamethasone (OR = 0.071; 95% CrI: 0.002, 0.733) compared to placebo.

Conclusion

This review found evidence that SCS reduces relapse in children following treatment for acute asthma, albeit based on a limited number of studies. Additional studies are required to assess the differential effect of SCS doses and treatment duration to prevent relapse in children following discharge for acute asthma.

### Steroid variability in pediatric inpatient asthmatics: survey on provider preferences of dexamethasone versus prednisone [^1116H3hL]. The Journal of Asthma (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective: Our hospital's pediatric Emergency Department (ED) began using dexamethasone for treating asthma exacerbations after ED studies showed non-inferiority of dexamethasone compared to prednisone. However, providers have not reached consensus on optimal inpatient steroid regimen. This study evaluates provider preference for inpatient steroid treatment. Methods: A survey was distributed to providers who care for inpatient pediatric asthmatics. Respondents answered questions about steroid choice and timing. Data were summarized as percentages; bivariate comparisons were analyzed with Pearson's chi-squared test. Results: Ninety-two providers completed the survey (60% response rate). When patients received dexamethasone in the ED, subsequent inpatient management was variable: 44% continued dexamethasone, 14% switched to prednisone, 2% said no additional steroids, and 40% said it depended on the scenario. Hospitalists were more likely to continue dexamethasone than pulmonologists (61% and 15%, respectively; p < .001). Factors that influenced providers to switch to prednisone in the inpatient setting included severity of exacerbation (73%) and asthma history (47%). Fifty-one percent felt uncomfortable using dexamethasone because of "minimal data to support [its] use inpatient". In case-based questions, 28% selected dexamethasone dosing intervals outside the recommended range. Thirteen percent reported experiencing errors in clinical practice. Conclusions: Use of dexamethasone in the ED for asthma exacerbations has led to uncertainty in inpatient steroid prescribing practices. Providers often revert to prednisone, especially in severe asthma exacerbations, possibly due to experience with prednisone and limited research on dexamethasone in the inpatient setting. Further research comparing the effectiveness of dexamethasone to prednisone in inpatient asthmatic children with various severities of illness is needed.

### Parent initiated prednisolone for acute asthma in children of school age: randomised controlled crossover trial [^111Z2hjj]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Acute asthma is one of the leading causes of emergency department presentation and hospital admission worldwide. Strategies to reduce the burden of symptoms related to acute asthma and cut health resource use are clearly needed. There is high level evidence that oral corticosteroids are effective in the treatment of acute asthma in children of school age when administered after the child has been assessed by a doctor.

Many of the benefits of oral corticosteroids have been shown to begin within three hours of administration, and delayed dosing is less effective at resolving acute asthma. Incorporating parent initiation of oral corticosteroids into the education and action plans for acute asthma that doctors provide families may be an effective way to ensure oral corticosteroid therapy is initiated promptly when a child suffers an episode of acute asthma. However, a strategy of parent initiated oral corticosteroids is likely to result in higher levels of administration of corticosteroids to children with asthma. This issue is of concern because in addition to their immediate effects on behaviourand adrenal function, oral corticosteroids are linked with reduced adult height in children with asthma. For example, as few as five short courses of oral corticosteroids over a seven year period during childhood has been associated with diminished bone mineral accrual. Therefore, the potential benefits of parent initiated oral corticosteroids require careful evaluation.

Parent initiated treatment with oral corticosteroids seems to be ineffective among preschool children with so called "viral induced wheeze", and the European Respiratory Society recently advised against parent initiated oral corticosteroids in children of preschool age with recurrent wheeze. Existing evidence regarding parent initiated oral corticosteroids in school age children with asthma is inadequate, and the role of parent initiation of oral corticosteroids is not clarified in international asthma management guidelines. None the less, parent initiated oral corticosteroids are widely used in clinical practice.

We undertook a double blind, randomised, crossover trial to determine the effectiveness of parent initiated oral prednisolone compared with placebo in children of primary school age who experience recurrent episodes of acute asthma.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^116gcij6]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Oral corticosteroids (OCS) — As a last resort, add-on low-dose OCS (≤ 7.5 mg/day prednisone equivalent) may be considered for some adults with severe asthma (Evidence D), but maintenance OCS is often associated with substantial cumulative side effects (Evidence A). It should only be considered for adults with poor symptom control and/or frequent exacerbations despite good inhaler technique and adherence with Step 5 treatment, and after exclusion of other contributory factors and trial of other add-on treatments including biologics where available and affordable. Patients should be counseled about potential side-effects, and they should be assessed and monitored for risk of adrenal suppression and corticosteroid-induced side effects.

### Global Initiative for Asthma strategy 2021: executive summary and rationale for key changes [^112c8V5R]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Start OCS early after presentation. For adults, give prednisolone 40–50 mg/d (or equivalent) for 5–7 days. For children, give prednisolone 1–2 mg/kg (maximum, 40 mg) for 3–5 days. Tapering is not needed if administered for < 2 weeks.

Review response of symptoms, vital signs, oxygen saturation and lung function after 1 hour (or earlier if worsening). Give ipratropium bromide only for severe exacerbations. Consider intravenous magnesium sulfate for patients with severe exacerbations not responding to initial treatment.

Do not routinely request chest radiography or routinely prescribe antibiotics for asthma exacerbations.

The decision on whether to hospitalize should be based on the patient's clinical status, lung function, response to treatment, recent and past history of exacerbations, social support, and ability to manage at home.

Rationale

Currently, inhaled albuterol is the usual bronchodilator in acute asthma management. Similar efficacy and safety of formoterol in the ED have been reported. In one study, high-dose budesonide–formoterol had similar efficacy and safety to SABA in ED patients.

Discharge Management

Before the patient goes home, arrange ongoing treatment. This should include starting ICS-containing controller treatment, preferably ICS–formoterol as MART (Table 1; Table E2 andin the online supplement) to reduce the risk of another exacerbation, or stepping up the dose of existing maintenance treatment for 2–4 weeks. Advise patients to use reliever medication as needed, not regularly. Patients prescribed ICS–formoterol as their reliever should return to this after an ED presentation.

### Inhaled flunisolide for management of acute asthma… [^111KuYMp]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

Corticosteroids have become the cornerstone of treatment for acute exacerbations of asthma. When these medications are started early, they reduce the morbidity of acute asthma. Multiple studies have shown that administration of oral, intramuscular, or intravenous steroids in the emergency department reduces the frequency of hospital admissions, improves pulmonary function, and decreases the relapse rate after discharge from the emergency department. The bronchodilators were repeated until the PEF was greater than 70 percent of predicted. The patients then were randomized into two groups. The first group received oral prednisone in a dosage of 2 mg per kg per day for seven days, along with a placebo metered-dose inhaler to be used in four inhalations twice daily. The second group received flu-nisolide to be used in four inhalations twice daily for seven days, along with placebo tablets to be taken daily.

Patients were provided with peak flow meters and instructions on how to use them. In addition, patients were given an albuterol inhaler to use on an as-needed basis for a PEF of less than 80 percent predicted. The patients were instructed to record symptoms and twice-daily PEF measurements on diary cards. Spirometry was repeated on days 3 and 7 of the study. At the end of the study, patients returned the diary cards and study drugs. Of the 58 participants, 27 received inhaled flunisolide. At baseline, there were no differences between the two groups with regard to asthma severity, race, sex, and age. There were no significant differences between the two groups with regard to symptom severity during the study, and the morning PEF measurements were similar for the two groups. At days 3 and 7 of the study, the forced expiratory volume in one second percentage of predicted was higher in the oral corticosteroid group than in the inhaled corticosteroid group.

Reported side effects were minimal in both groups. Based on clinical examination, the authors conclude that there is no difference between inhaled and oral corticosteroids in the treatment of acute asthma exacerbations in children. They add that spirometry data were better in the oral corticosteroid group, which suggests that this method provides more rapid resolution of asthma.

### Management of acute loss of asthma control in the yellow zone: a practice parameter [^111o8dnF]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Yellow zone asthma — ICS dose escalation evidence indicates that several recent randomized controlled studies have failed to demonstrate that doubling doses of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) in those already receiving ICS therapy is effective, whereas the EPR3 guidelines state that the preliminary evidence suggests that quadrupling the dose of an ICS for 7 days, starting at the first appearance of worsening symptoms, can prevent exacerbations. In a randomized trial, 208 patients at least 16 years old with current asthma stabilized on an ICS (200–1,000 μg of beclomethasone) were randomized to placebo or a quadrupled ICS dose, with intervention criteria of worsening asthma control, onset of an upper respiratory tract infection (RTI), peak expiratory flow (PEF) decrease by 15% on 2 consecutive days, or PEF decrease by 30% on 1 day; OCS-requiring exacerbations occurred in Eighteen of 197 (9%) versus 29 of 203 (14%), yielding a risk ratio of 0.64 (95% confidence limits 0.37 — 1.11, P = 0.11), and per-protocol analysis showed a risk ratio of 0.43 for requiring an OCS.

### Patient-and parent-initiated oral steroids for asthma exacerbations [^112oMrR4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways affecting an estimated 334 million people worldwide. During severe exacerbations, patients may need to attend a medical centre or hospital emergency department for treatment with systemic corticosteroids, which can be administered intravenously or orally. Some people with asthma are prescribed oral corticosteroids (OCS) for self-administration (i.e. patient-initiated) or to administer to their child with asthma (i.e. parent-initiated), in the event of an exacerbation. This approach to treatment is becoming increasingly common.

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of patient- or parent-initiated oral steroids for adults and children with asthma exacerbations.

Search Methods

We identified trials from Cochrane Airways' Specialised Register (CASR) and also conducted a search of the US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov) and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (apps.who.int/trialsearch). We searched CASR from its inception to 18 May 2016 and trial registries from their inception to 24 August 2016; we imposed no restriction on language of publication.

Selection Criteria

We looked for randomised controlled trials (RCTs), reported as full-text, those published as abstract only, and unpublished data; we excluded cross-over trials. We looked for studies where adults (aged 18 years or older) or children of school age (aged 5 years or older) with asthma were randomised to receive: (a) any patient-/parent-initiated OCS or (b) placebo, normal care, alternative active treatment, or an identical personalised asthma action plan without the patient- or parent-initiated OCS component.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened the search results to identify any studies that met the prespecified inclusion criteria. The prespecified primary outcomes were hospital admissions for asthma, asthma symptoms at follow-up and serious adverse events.

Main Results

Despite comprehensive searches of electronic databases and clinical trial registries, we did not identify any studies meeting the inclusion criteria for this review. Five potentially relevant studies were excluded for two reasons: the intervention did not meet the inclusion criteria for this review (three studies) and studies had a cross-over design (two studies). Two of the excluded studies asked the relevant clinical question. However, these studies were excluded due to their cross-over design, as per the protocol. We contacted the authors of the cross-over trials who were unable to provide data for the first treatment period (i.e. prior to cross-over).

Authors' Conclusions

There is currently no evidence from randomised trials (non-cross-over design) to inform the use of patient- or parent-initiated oral corticosteroids in people with asthma.

### Corticosteroids for hospitalised children with acute asthma [^111dDkHr]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Systemic corticosteroids are used routinely in the management of children with severe acute asthma. There is a lack of consensus regarding the agent, dose and route of corticosteroid administration.

Objectives

To determine the benefit of systemic corticosteroids (oral, intravenous, or intramuscular) compared to placebo and inhaled steroids in acute paediatric asthma.

Search Strategy

All controlled trials were identified from the Cochrane Airways Review Group Register, hand searching of respiratory journals, reference lists and contacts with experts and pharmaceutical companies.

Selection Criteria

Studies were included if they described a randomised controlled trial (RCT) involving children aged 1–18 years with severe acute asthma who received oral, inhaled, intravenous or intramuscular corticosteroids. Only studies in which patients required hospital admission were included.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers using a standard form extracted all data. All data, numeric calculations and graphic extrapolations were independently confirmed.

Main Results

Seven trials were included with a total of 426 children studied (274 with oral prednisone vs. placebo, 106 with intravenous steroids vs placebo and 46 with nebulised budesonide vs prednisolone). A significant number of steroid treated children were discharged early after admission (> 4 hours) with an OR of 7.00 (95% CI: 2.98 to 16.45) and NNT of 3 (95%CI: 2 to 8). The length of stay was shorter in the steroid groups with a WMD of -8.75 hours (95% CI: -19.23 to 1.74). There were no significant differences between groups in pulmonary function or oxygen saturation measurements. Children treated with steroids in hospital were less likely to relapse within one to three months with OR 0.19 (95%CI: 0.07 to 0.55) and NNT of 3 (95%CI: 2 to 7). The single small study that compared nebulised budesonide to oral prednisone failed to demonstrate equivalence or a difference between each therapy.

Reviewer's Conclusions

Systemic corticosteroids produce some improvements for children admitted to hospital with acute asthma. The benefits may include earlier discharge and fewer relapses. Inhaled or nebulised corticosteroids cannot be recommended as equivalent to systemic steroids at this time. Further studies examining differing doses and routes of administration for corticosteroids will clarify the optimal therapy.

### Ipratropium bromide for acute asthma exacerbations in the emergency setting: a literature review of the evidence [^111fzTGS]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2009). Low credibility.

Since the 1970s, when inhaled anticholinergic agents were first introduced as adjunct therapies for the immediate treatment of pediatric asthma exacerbations, several trials have shown varying degrees of benefit from their use as bronchodilators in combination with inhaled short-acting beta-adrenergic agonists and systemic corticosteroids. Although other anticholinergics exist, ipratropium bromide (IB) specifically has emerged as the overwhelming choice of pulmonologists and emergency physicians because of its limited systemic absorption from the lungs when given as an inhaled preparation. However, although the varying trials, predominantly in the emergency department setting, have typically shown a trend toward improved outcomes, none has set forth clear dosing protocol recommendations for use by practicing physicians. It is our goal in this review of the available literature on the use of IB, as an adjunct to inhaled short-acting beta-adrenergic agonists, to summarize practical, evidence-based recommendations for use in the pediatric emergency department setting for acute asthma exacerbations. We also hope to better delineate the most effective dosing regimen in those patients who might benefit most from the addition of IB and to explore proposed additional benefits it may have as a modulator of cholinergic-induced effects from high-dose beta-agonist therapy and viral triggers.

### Intramuscular versus oral corticosteroids to reduce relapses following discharge from the emergency department for acute asthma [^117LJQjE]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Acute asthma is a common cause of presentations to acute care centres, such as the emergency department (ED), and while the majority of patients can be discharged, relapse requiring additional medical care is common. Systemic corticosteroids are a major part in the treatment of moderate to severe acute asthma; however, there is no clear evidence regarding the most effective route of administration for improving outcomes in patients discharged from acute care.

Objectives

To examine the effectiveness and safety of a single dose of intramuscular (IM) corticosteroids provided prior to discharge compared to a short course of oral corticosteroids in the treatment of acute asthma patients discharged from an ED or equivalent acute care setting.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Airways Group conducted searches of the Cochrane Airways Group Register of Trials, most recently on 14 March 2018. In addition in April 2017 we completed an extensive search of nine electronic databases including Medline, Embase, EBM ALL, Global Health, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, CINAHL, SCOPUS, Proquest Dissertations and Theses Global, and LILACS. Furthermore, we searched the grey literature to identify any additional studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials or controlled clinical trials if they compared the effectiveness of intramuscular (IM) versus oral corticosteroids to treat paediatric or adult patients presenting with acute asthma to an ED or equivalent acute care setting. Two independent reviewers assessed study eligibility and study quality. We resolved disagreements via a third party and assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool. We assessed the quality of the evidence using GRADE.

Data Collection and Analysis

For dichotomous outcomes, we calculated individual and pooled statistics as risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using a random-effects model. We reported continuous outcomes using mean difference (MD) or standardised mean difference (SMD) with 95% CIs using a random-effects model. We reported heterogeneity using I² and Cochran Q statistics. We used standard procedures recommended by Cochrane.

Main Results

Nine studies involving 804 participants (IM = 402 participants; oral = 402 participants) met our review inclusion criteria. Four studies enrolled children (n = 245 participants), while five studies enrolled adults (n = 559 participants). All of the studies recruited participants presenting to an ED, except one study which recruited participants attending a primary care clinic. All of the paediatric studies compared intramuscular (IM) dexamethasone to oral prednisone/prednisolone. In the adult studies, the IM corticosteroid provided ranged from methylprednisolone, betamethasone, dexamethasone, or triamcinolone, while the regimen of oral corticosteroids provided consisted of prednisone, methylprednisolone, or dexamethasone. Only five studies were placebo controlled. For the purposes of this review, we did not take corticosteroid dose equivalency into account in the analysis. The most common co-intervention provided to participants during the acute care visit included short-acting beta₂-agonists (SABA), methylxanthines, and ipratropium bromide. In some instances, some studies reported providing some participants with supplemental oral or IV corticosteroids during their stay in the ED. Co-interventions provided to participants at discharge consisted primarily of SABA, methylxanthine, long-acting beta₂-agonists (LABA), and ipratropium bromide. The risk of bias of the included studies ranged from unclear to high across various domains. The primary outcome of interest was relapse to additional care defined as an unscheduled visit to a health practitioner for worsening asthma symptoms, or requiring subsequent treatment with corticosteroids which may have occurred at any time point after discharge from the ED. We found intramuscular and oral corticosteroids to be similarly effective in reducing the risk for relapse (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.24; 9 studies, 804 participants; I² = 0%; low-quality evidence). We found no subgroup differences in relapse rates between paediatric and adult participants (P = 0.71), relapse occurring within or after 10 days post-discharge (P = 0.22), or participants with mild/moderate or severe exacerbations (P = 0.35). While we found no statistical difference between participants receiving IM versus oral corticosteroids regarding the risk for adverse events (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.07; 5 studies, 404 participants; I² = 0%; moderate-quality evidence), an estimated 50 fewer patients per 1000 receiving IM corticosteroids reported experiencing adverse events (95% from 106 fewer to 21 more). We found inconsistent reporting of specific adverse events across the studies. There were no differences in the frequency of specific adverse events including nausea and vomiting, pain, swelling, redness, insomnia, or personality changes. We did not seek additional adverse events data. Participants receiving IM corticosteroids or oral corticosteroids both reported decreases in peak expiratory flow (MD -7.78 L/min, 95% CI -38.83 L/min to 23.28 L/min; 4 studies, 272 participants; I² = 33%; moderate-quality evidence), similar symptom persistence (RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.14 to 1.20; 3 studies, 80 participants; I² = 44%; low-quality evidence), and 24-hour beta-agonist use (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.21 to 1.37; 2 studies, 48 participants; I² = 0%; low-quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

There is insufficient evidence to identify whether IM corticosteroids are more effective in reducing relapse compared to oral corticosteroids among children or adults discharged from an ED or equivalent acute care setting for acute asthma. While we found no statistical differences, patients receiving IM corticosteroids reported fewer adverse events. Additional studies comparing the effectiveness of IM versus oral corticosteroids could provide further evidence clarity. Furthermore, there is a need for studies comparing different IM corticosteroids (e.g. IM dexamethasone versus IM methylprednisone) and different oral corticosteroids (e.g. oral dexamethasone versus oral prednisone), with consideration for dosing and pharmacokinetic properties, to better identify the optimal IM or oral corticosteroid regimens to improve patient outcomes. Other factors, such as patient preference and potential issues with adherence, may dictate practitioner prescribing.

### Management of acute loss of asthma control in the yellow zone: a practice parameter [^114QRn2S]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Yellow zone symptom-based action plan — In mild persistent asthma, intermittent corticosteroid bursts under predetermined criteria consisted of open-label budesonide (800 mcg twice daily) for 10 days or prednisone (0.5 mg/kg of body weight per day) for 5 days if symptoms worsened, and the 3 treatments produced similar increases in morning peak expiratory flow (PEF) and similar rates of asthma exacerbations; based on these results, the authors suggest that it is possible to treat mild persistent asthma with short intermittent courses of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) or oral corticosteroids (OCS) taken when symptoms worsen.

### Asthma update [^112whHmD]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Asthma continues to be one of the most common reasons for emergency department visits and a leading cause of hospitalization. Acute management involves severity-based treatment of bronchoconstriction and underlying airway inflammation. Optimal treatment has been defined and standardized through randomized controlled trials, systematic reviews, and consensus guidelines. Implementation of clinical practice guidelines may improve clinical, quality, and safety outcomes. Asthma morbidity is disproportionately high in poor, urban, and minority children. Children treated in emergency departments commonly have persistent chronic severity, significant morbidity, and infrequent follow-up and primary asthma care, and prescription of inhaled corticosteroids is appropriate.

### Effectiveness of inhaled corticosteroids in controlling acute asthma exacerbations in children at home [^111w7tK1]. Clinical Pediatrics (2001). Low credibility.

Many clinicians advise their patients to increase the dose of inhaled corticosteroids during acute asthma exacerbations, without strong clinical evidence supporting this treatment. This study investigates the effectiveness of inhaled corticosteroids in controlling acute asthma exacerbations in children at home. The study population consisted of children with mild intermittent, mild and moderate persistent asthma aged 1 to 14 years who were treated in our outpatient clinic with inhaled budesonide for 1 year. After participating in an asthma education session, the parents were instructed to initiate treatment with inhaled budesonide at the first signs of asthma exacerbation, starting with 200 to 400 microg budesonide, in combination with beta-2 agonists 4 times a day and followed by a decrease in the dose in 4 to 8 days. Asthma status and peak expiratory flow rates were measured in the 3 monthly follow-up visits. Only children who complied with the treatment regimen and came for follow-up visits regularly were included in the final analysis. One hundred fifty children used our treatment protocol with inhaled budesonide to control their asthma attacks. Clinical improvement of asthma symptoms was achieved after a mean of 1.8 ± 0.7 days from the beginning of treatment. The parents were able to control 94% of the 1,061 episodes of asthma exacerbation occurring during a cumulative follow-up period of 239 years. In the 3-month period before enrollment, 101 children (67%) had used oral corticosteroids to control their asthma attacks and 50 (33%) were hospitalized. During the entire follow-up period, only 11 children (7%) used oral corticosteroids, and none of the children were hospitalized. The present study demonstrates that children with asthma can control their exacerbations at home using inhaled corticosteroids (budesonide). Treatment, starting with relatively high doses followed by a rapid reduction in dose over 4–8 days, resulted in a decrease in the use of oral steroids and in hospitalization. To achieve good results, patient compliance is essential.

Short-acting beta agonist (SABA) dosing is 2–6 puffs of salbutamol by spacer, or 2.5 mg by nebulizer, every 20 minutes for the first hour, then severity is reassessed; if symptoms persist or recur, give an additional 2–3 puffs per hour and admit to hospital if > 10 puffs are required in 3–4 hours. Systemic corticosteroids include an initial oral prednisolone dose of 1–2 mg/kg up to a maximum 20 mg for children < 2 years old or 30 mg for children 2–5 years, or intravenous methylprednisolone 1 mg/kg 6-hourly on day 1. Additional options in the first hour are to consider adding ipratropium bromide (1–2 puffs by pMDI and spacer; if poor response to initial SABA, nebulized ipratropium bromide 250 mcg every 20 minutes for 1 hour only) and to consider nebulized isotonic magnesium sulfate (150 mg) as 3 doses in the first hour for children aged ≥ 2 years with severe exacerbation. If inhalation is not possible, an intravenous bolus of terbutaline 2 mcg/kg may be given over 5 minutes, followed by continuous infusion of 5 mcg/kg/hour.

### Methylprednisolone (methylprednisolone sodium succinate) [^1124pUMs]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) recommended dosing for systemic prednisone, prednisolone, or methylprednisolone in pediatric patients whose asthma is uncontrolled by inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting bronchodilators is 1 mg/kg/day to 2 mg/kg/day in single or divided doses. It is further recommended that short course, or "burst" therapy, be continued until the patient achieves a peak expiratory flow rate of 80% of his or her personal best or until symptoms resolve. This usually requires 3 to 10 days of treatment, although it can take longer. There is no evidence that tapering the dose after improvement will prevent a relapse.

Dosage may be reduced for infants and children but should be governed more by the severity of the condition and response of the patient than by age or size. It should not be less than 0.5 mg per kg every 24 hours.

Dosage must be decreased or discontinued gradually when the drug has been administered for more than a few days. If a period of spontaneous remission occurs in a chronic condition, treatment should be discontinued. Routine laboratory studies, such as urinalysis, two-hour postprandial blood sugar, determination of blood pressure and body weight and a chest X-ray should be made at regular intervals during prolonged therapy. Upper GI X-rays are desirable in patients with an ulcer history or significant dyspepsia.

In treatment of acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis, daily doses of 160 mg of methylprednisolone for a week followed by 64 mg every other day for 1 month have been shown to be effective (see PRECAUTIONS, Neurologic-psychiatric).

For the purpose of comparison, the following is the equivalent milligram dosage of the various glucocorticoids:

These dose relationships apply only to oral or intravenous administration of these compounds. When these substances or their derivatives are injected intramuscularly or into joint spaces, their relative properties may be greatly altered.

### Parent initiated prednisolone for acute asthma in children of school age: randomised controlled crossover trial [^115okSPN]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions and policy implications

The results of this study are important because there has been minimal previous success in identifying parent initiated strategies that may reduce the burden of acute asthma in children. One of the approaches that has been evaluated is administration of a short course of inhaled corticosteroids. Although there is some evidence that high dose inhaled corticosteroids may be effective in the treatment of acute asthma in the hospital settingand may also be associated with modest benefit in the ambulatory setting, high dose inhaled corticosteroids are not as effective as oral corticosteroids.

A second approach is the use of formulations containing an inhaled corticosteroid and a long acting β agonist. Among children with uncontrolled asthma, the use of inhaled corticosteroids and a long acting β agonist as both maintenance and reliever medication may reduce asthma related health resource use compared with fixed dose inhaled corticosteroids and a long acting β agonist as maintenance treatment only. However, fewer than 15% of children who present to an emergency department with an episode of acute asthma have a background of uncontrolled asthma; therefore, maintenance and reliever treatment with inhaled corticosteroids and a long acting β agonist is not appropriate for the great majority of children likely to use health resources to relieve acute asthma.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: a Report from the national asthma education and prevention program coordinating committee expert panel working group [^115U2zH5]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). High credibility.

Asthma management — Recommendation 11 (short-term increase in inhaled corticosteroid [ICS] dose) states that in individuals aged 4 years and older with mild to moderate persistent asthma who are likely to adhere to daily ICS treatment, the Expert Panel conditionally recommends against a short-term increase in the ICS dose for increased symptoms or decreased peak flow, with a conditional recommendation, low certainty of evidence. A short-term increase is defined as a doubling, quadrupling, or quintupling of the regular daily dose, and the Expert Panel does not recommend doubling, quadrupling, or quintupling the ICS dose for increased symptoms or decreased peak flow; however, clinicians can consider quadrupling the regular daily dose for individuals aged 16 years and older whose adherence to daily therapy is not assured. Evidence includes pediatric data showing that in children aged 4 to 11 years, temporarily increasing the ICS dose did not significantly reduce exacerbations or improve quality of life, and in one 48-week study the growth rate in the intervention group was reduced without statistical significance (P = 0.06). In individuals aged 12 years and older, the intervention as implemented did not significantly reduce exacerbations or asthma hospitalizations; although a large study reported a modest but significant reduction in time to severe exacerbation and systemic corticosteroid use with a quadrupling action plan, baseline adherence was low, with only 50% in the quadruple-dose group and 42% in the non–quadruple-dose group having good adherence. Based on the lack of efficacy in the studies and possible growth effects, the Expert Panel made a recommendation against a short-term increase in the ICS dose.

### Selecting a systemic corticosteroid for acute asthma in young children [^115PDbnY]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2003). Low credibility.

Oral corticosteroids are as effective as intravenous therapy for treating acute exacerbations of asthma. They are available in tablets that can be crushed and mixed with soft food or syrup, and in a variety of liquid formulations that differ in volume required, palatability, patient acceptance, and cost. The most important consideration in product selection for a young child is that the doses can be easily swallowed and retained.

### Impact of a discharge prescription for dexamethasone on outcomes of children treated in the emergency department for acute asthma exacerbations [^1161ZC7D]. The Journal of Asthma (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate dexamethasone prescribing practices, patient adherence, and outcomes by dosing regimen in children with acute asthma discharged from the emergency department (ED).

Study Design

Prospective study of children 2-18years treated with dexamethasone for acute asthma prior to discharge from an urban, tertiary care ED between 2018 and 2022. Demographics, clinical characteristics, ED treatment, and discharge prescriptions were collected via chart review. The exposure was discharge prescription (additional dose) versus no discharge prescription for dexamethasone. The primary outcome was treatment failure, defined as return ED visit, unplanned primary care visit, and/or ongoing bronchodilator use. Secondary outcomes included medication adherence, symptom persistence, quality-of-life, and school/work absenteeism. Outcomes were assessed by telephone 7-10days after discharge.

Results

564 subjects were enrolled; 338 caregivers (60%) completed follow-up. Children were a median age 7 years, 30% Black or African American, 49% Hispanic, and 79% had public insurance. A discharge prescription for dexamethasone was written for 482 (86%) children and was significantly associated with exacerbation severity, number of combined albuterol/ipratropium treatments, and longer length of stay. There was no difference in treatment failure between the discharge prescription and no discharge prescription groups (RR 0.87; 0.67, 1.12), including after adjusting for potential confounders; there was no difference between groups in secondary outcomes.

Conclusions

Prescription for an additional dexamethasone dose was not associated with reduced treatment failure or improved outcomes for children with acute asthma discharged from the ED. Single, ED-dose of dexamethasone prior to discharge may be sufficient for children with mild to moderate asthma exacerbations.

### Inhaled budesonide in the management of acute worsenings and exacerbations of asthma: a review of the evidence [^113fCEr7]. Respiratory Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

The use of systemic corticosteroids, together with bronchodilators and oxygen therapy, has become established for the management of acute asthma. These agents are undoubtedly effective, but are also associated with problems such as metabolic adverse effects. Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) offer potential benefit in the acute setting because they are delivered directly to the airways. They are also likely to reduce systemic exposure, which would lead in turn to reductions in rates of unwanted systemic effects. In order to evaluate the role of budesonide in the management of acute asthma exacerbations we conducted a review of the literature and critically evaluated the rationale for the use of ICS in general in this setting. Trials in adults and children requiring treatment for acute exacerbation of asthma have shown clinical and/or spirometric benefit for budesonide when delivered via nebulizer, dry powder inhaler, or aerosol in the emergency department, hospital and follow-up settings. The efficacy seems to benefit from high doses given repeatedly during the initial phase of an acute exacerbation. These acute effects are likely to be linked to the drug's distinctive pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile. The current evidence base revealed encouraging results regarding the efficacy of the ICS budesonide in patients with wheeze and acute worsening of asthma. Future studies should focus on the efficacy of these agents in more severe asthma worsenings.

### Identifying parental preferences for corticosteroid and inhaled β-agonist delivery mode in children with acute asthma exacerbations [^113YMFqX]. Clinical Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

This study examines caregiver preferences of single-dose dexamethasone (DEX) versus 5-day oral prednisolone in treating acute asthma exacerbation in a pediatric emergency department (PED). A secondary objective was preference for mode of home inhaled β-agonist administration. Caregivers of patients 2 to 18 years with an acute asthma exacerbation treated in the PED completed a 1-page questionnaire including asthma history and preferences for steroids and β-agonist administration. One hundred caregivers completed the questionnaire. Within the preceding year, 79% had an asthma exacerbation and 73.7% (n = 99) were prescribed prednisolone. DEX was preferred by 79% of caregivers. Preferences were independent of caregiver demographics except in cases of prior intensive care admission, where DEX was less favored (odds ratio = 0.27, P < .046). No difference existed in mode of home β-agonist administration. Most caregivers prefer DEX in acute asthma exacerbation management. No difference exists for home β-agonists. These results may advise clinical practice in pediatric acute asthma exacerbation.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^114dekQp]. GINA (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for asthma, more specifically with respect to management of exacerbation, emergency department setting (ICSs), GINA 2025 guidelines recommend to consider administering ICSs, with or without concomitant systemic corticosteroids, within the first hours of presentation to the emergency department to reduce the risk of hospital admission and the need for systemic corticosteroids in pediatric patients.

### Prednisolone sodium phosphate [^112nDjuY]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

In the treatment of acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis, daily doses of 200 mg of prednisolone for a week followed by 80 mg every other day or 4 to 8 mg dexamethasone every other day for one month have been shown to be effective.

In pediatric patients, the initial dose of prednisolone sodium phosphate oral solution may vary depending on the specific disease entity being treated. The range of initial doses is 0.14 to 2 mg/kg/day in three or four divided doses (4 to 60 mg/m2bsa/day).

The standard regimen used to treat nephrotic syndrome in pediatric patients is 60 mg/m2/day given in three divided doses for 4 weeks, followed by 4 weeks of single dose alternate-day therapy at 40 mg/m2/day.

The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) recommended dosing for systemic prednisone, prednisolone or methylprednisolone in children whose asthma is uncontrolled by inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting bronchodilators is 1–2 mg/kg/day in single or divided doses. It is further recommended that short course, or "burst" therapy, be continued until a child achieves a peak expiratory flow rate of 80% of his or her personal best or symptoms resolve. This usually requires 3 to 10 days of treatment, although it can take longer. There is no evidence that tapering the dose after improvement will prevent a relapse.

For the purpose of comparison, 5 mL of prednisolone sodium phosphate oral solution (20.2 mg prednisolone sodium phosphate) is equivalent to the following milligram dosage of the various glucocorticoids:

These dose relationships apply only to oral or intravenous administration of these compounds. When these substances or their derivatives are injected intramuscularly or into joint spaces, their relative properties may be greatly altered.

Managing Exacerbations in Children 5 Years and Younger

Early symptoms of exacerbations in young children may include increased symptoms, increased coughing (especially at night), lethargy or reduced exercise tolerance, impaired daily activities including feeding, and a poor response to reliever medication.

Managing Exacerbations at Home

Give a written asthma action plan to parents/caregivers of young children with asthma so they can recognize an impending exacerbation, start treatment, and identify when urgent hospital treatment is required. Initial treatment at home is with inhaled SABA, with review after 1 hour or earlier. If inhaled SABA is needed more often than every 3 hours or for > 24 hours, treatment by a health provider is needed on the same day. Parents/caregivers should seek urgent medical care if the child is acutely distressed, lethargic, fails to respond to initial bronchodilator therapy, or is worsening, especially in children younger than 1 year.

Rationale

Most children with wheezing due to asthma respond to SABA. There is insufficient evidence for parent-initiated OCS in this age group. Preemptive, episodic, parent-initiated high-dose nebulized ICS may reduce exacerbations in children with intermittent virally triggered wheezing, but there are no long-term studies, and there is a high risk of side effects; it should only be considered if the clinician is confident that it will be used appropriately and that the child will be monitored closely for side effects.

Managing Exacerbations in Primary Care or Acute Care Facility

Assess the severity of the exacerbation while initiating treatment with SABA (2–6 puffs every 20 min for first hour) and controlled oxygen to maintain a saturation of 94–98%. Arrange immediate transfer to a hospital if the child shows no response to inhaled SABA within 1–2 hours, is unable to speak or drink, has a respiratory rate > 40/min or is cyanosed, has oxygen saturation < 92% on room air, or cannot be safely cared for at home.

For children attending an ED or admitted to hospital with asthma, consider systemic corticosteroids: oral prednisone/prednisolone 1–2 mg/kg/d for up to 5 days (maximum of 20 mg/d for children 0–2 years and 30 mg/d for children 3–5 yr) or dexamethasone 0.6 mg/kg/d for 2 days.

### Effectiveness of inhaled corticosteroids for acute asthma… [^114AAQ3U]. AAFP (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical Question Does patient-initiated home management of asthma exacerbations with increased doses of inhaled corticosteroids reduce the need for further intervention compared with a daily maintenance dosage of an ICS among children and adults with mild to moderate persistent asthma. Evidence-Based Answer In this Cochrane review, patients with mild to moderate persistent asthma and symptoms consistent with an acute asthma exacerbation who are treated with increased doses of ICSs show no reduction in the need for further intervention with primarily systemic corticosteroids vs. patients treated with stable doses of ICSs. Similarly, increased doses of ICSs do not reduce unscheduled visits to physicians, acute care facilities, or emergency departments or hospital admissions compared with stable doses of ICSs.

1.

2, 3 Early recognition and management of asthma exacerbations are essential in reducing morbidity, mortality, and health care costs associated with asthma. Asthma action plans, which are written, patient-initiated, home management guidelines that describe maintenance therapy and steps for treatment escalation during an exacerbation, decrease the severity and duration of asthma exacerbations. 1 ICSs are a mainstay of asthma action plans, and the Global Initiative for Asthma guideline recommends increased ICS dosing during an asthma exacerbation.
4. The authors of the Cochrane review sought to determine the safety and effectiveness of increased ICS dosing as part of patient-initiated home management in children and adults with mild to moderate persistent asthma.

Among children and adults with mild to moderate persistent asthma, action plans that instructed patients to increase their ICS dose at the onset of worsening asthma symptoms did not reduce asthma exacerbation severity or duration and, therefore, did not reduce the need for systemic corticosteroids. Unscheduled physician visits, visits to the emergency department, and hospitalizations were not reduced. Secondary outcomes, including serious and nonserious adverse events associated with increased ICS dosing, could not be included or excluded due to a lack of clinical significance. A notable 2018 nonblinded study, which was excluded from this Cochrane review, indicated that quadrupling the ICS dose may reduce systemic corticosteroid use or an unscheduled health care consultation for asthma over 12 months, particularly among people with more severe asthma.

### The use of β ₂-agonist therapy before hospital attendance for severe asthma exacerbations: a post-hoc analysis [^115ons9H]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Materials and methods

An exploratory post hoc analysis of data was undertaken from a 24-week multicentre, prospective, open-label, RCT of the SMART versus Standard regimens in asthma patients aged 16 to 65 years. Eligible patients had a physician's diagnosis of asthma, a current prescription for inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) and at least one asthma exacerbation in the preceding year. Patients who had high baseline reliever use were not excluded, and there was no step-down in maintenance inhaled treatment on entry into the study. Full details of the trial have been published. The Study Protocol is available at, and see the Supplementary Material for further details. All patients provided written informed consent, and the New Zealand Multi-Region Ethics Committee approved the study protocol (MEC/09/11/127).

There were 151 patients randomised to receive 200/6 μg budesonide/formoterol via MDI (Vannair, AstraZeneca NZ Limited, Auckland, New Zealand; this is the MDI formulation of Symbicort Turbuhaler), two actuations twice daily as maintenance with extra doses for relief of symptoms as per the SMART regimen (SMART group), and 152 patients were randomised to receive 200/6 μg budesonide/formoterol via MDI, two actuations twice daily as maintenance with salbutamol 100 μg via MDI (Ventolin, GlaxoSmithKline NZ Limited, Auckland, New Zealand) for relief of symptoms (Standard group). Five study visits occurred over 24 weeks. At the first visit, all participants had their inhaler technique checked and were provided verbal instructions and written asthma self-management plans corresponding to their randomised regimen. Patients who previously had GP-prescribed prednisone for self-initiation during an exacerbation were able to continue with this practice during the study. Patients who self-initiated prednisone for asthma were advised to also seek medical review. This analysis is restricted to patients with a severe exacerbation of asthma that resulted in an acute presentation to a hospital Emergency Department and/or admission to hospital during the study period.

### Questions in mild asthma: an official American Thoracic Society research statement [^11489SRU]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). High credibility.

New approaches to using approved medications for treatment of mild pediatric asthma — several inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)-based strategies are endorsed by the NAEPP guideline and GINA statement, and low-dose ICS is effective in controlling symptoms in children; in the 5- to 44-year age group, ICS reduced hospitalization risk by 31% in those who used at least one canister of ICS during each of the four quarters of the year, there was a progressive decline in mortality risk with increasing ICS use with a decrease of more than 50% with the use of more than six ICS canisters annually, low-dose ICS reduced the risk of a serious exacerbation (admission, emergency treatment, or death) by 41%, and severe exacerbations requiring systemic corticosteroids were reduced by 0.48 in children and adults with 0 or 1 symptom day per week alongside higher prebronchodilator lung function and more symptom-free days.

### Oral corticosteroid-sparing effects of inhaled corticosteroids in the treatment of persistent and acute asthma [^112SVGBE]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the efficacy and safety of inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) when used to reduce daily oral corticosteroid (OCS) requirements in patients with severe persistent asthma and periodic requirements in patients with acute asthma exacerbations.

Data Sources

Clinical studies of the OCS-sparing effects of ICSs were located by searching MEDLINE databases from 1966 onward using the terms oral, steroid, and asthma in combination with the generic names for each marketed ICS.

Study Selection

Studies reporting on the use of ICSs to reduce OCS requirements in patients with persistent and acute asthma are included.

Results

Clinical study results consistently show that ICSs significantly improve asthma control and reduce OCS requirements among adults, children, and infants with persistent asthma. A dose reduction or complete discontinuation of use of OCSs is possible in most patients without loss of asthma control. ICSs also can control asthma during acute asthma exacerbations and reduce the need for short courses of OCSs. With many ICSs, the reductions in OCS use are accompanied by recovery of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function, indicating that the safety of asthma therapy is improved when OCS requirements are decreased with ICSs. Of the available ICSs that may reduce OCS needs, budesonide appears to be the most intensively studied.

Conclusions

ICSs can reduce OCS requirements in adults and children with persistent asthma and during acute asthma exacerbations. The reduced systemic corticosteroid activity associated with ICS treatment improves the overall safety of asthma therapy.

### Asthma in adults [^111xj3A3]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2010). Medium credibility.

Introduction

About 10% of adults have suffered an attack of asthma, and up to 5% of these have severe disease that responds poorly to treatment. Patients with severe disease have an increased risk of death, but patients with mild-to-moderate disease are also at risk of exacerbations. Most guidelines about the management of asthma follow stepwise protocols. This review does not endorse or follow any particular protocol, but presents the evidence about specific interventions.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of treatments for chronic asthma? What are the effects of treatments for acute asthma? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to June 2008 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 99 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions. For acute asthma: beta(2) agonists (plus ipratropium bromide, pressured metered-dose inhalers, short-acting continuous nebulised, short-acting intermittent nebulised, and short-acting intravenous); corticosteroids (inhaled); corticosteroids (single oral, combined inhaled, and short courses); education about acute asthma; generalist care; helium-oxygen mixture (heliox); magnesium sulphate (intravenous and adding isotonic nebulised magnesium to inhaled beta(2) agonists); mechanical ventilation; oxygen supplementation (controlled 28% oxygen and controlled 100% oxygen); and specialist care. For chronic asthma: beta(2) agonists (adding long-acting inhaled beta(2) agonists when asthma is poorly controlled by inhaled corticosteroids, or short-acting inhaled beta(2) agonists as needed for symptom relief); inhaled corticosteroids (low dose and increasing dose); leukotriene antagonists (with or without inhaled corticosteroids); and theophylline (when poorly controlled by inhaled corticosteroids).

### Randomised pragmatic comparison of UK and US treatment of acute asthma presenting to hospital [^113fBCKA]. Thorax (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Systemic corticosteroids and inhaled beta(2) agonists are accepted first line treatments for acute severe asthma, but there is no consensus on their optimum dosage and frequency of administration. American regimens include higher initial dosages of beta(2) agonists and corticosteroids than UK regimens.

Methods

In a prospective, pragmatic, randomised, parallel group study, 170 patients of mean (SD) age 37 (12) years with acute asthma (peak expiratory flow (PEF) 212 (80) l/min) presenting to hospital received treatment with either high dose prednisolone and continuous nebulised salbutamol as recommended in the US or lower dose prednisolone and bolus nebulised salbutamol as recommended in the UK by the BTS.

Results

Outcome measures were: deltaPEF at 1 hour (BTS 89 l/min, US 106 l/min, p = 0.2, CI -8 to 41) and at 2 hours (BTS 49 l/min, US 101 l/min, p < 0.0001, CI 28 to 77); time to discharge if admitted (BTS 4 days, US 4 days); rates of achieving discharge PEF (> 60%) at 2 hours (BTS 64%, US 78%, p = 0.04); time to regain control of asthma as measured by PEF ≥ 80% best with ≤ 20% variability (BTS 3 days, US 4 days, p = 0.6); PEF at 24 hours in patients admitted (BTS 293 l/min, US 288 l/min, p = 0.8); and control of asthma in the subsequent month (no significant differences).

Conclusions

Treatment with higher doses of continuous nebulised salbutamol leads to a greater immediate improvement in PEF but the degree of recovery at 24 hours and speed of recovery thereafter is achieved as effectively with lower corticosteroid doses as recommended in the British guidelines.
