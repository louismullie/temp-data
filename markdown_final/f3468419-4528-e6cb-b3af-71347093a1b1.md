## Question

Diabetes and thyroid hormone level

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the relationship between diabetes and thyroid hormone levels, including mechanisms, directionality, clinical implications, and screening or treatment guidance. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the strength and hierarchy of evidence and how to appraise it. Then, I should extract and verify the key associations from meta-analyses and large cohorts. Next, I will examine mechanistic plausibility and bidirectionality. After that, I need to consider special populations such as pregnancy and pediatrics. Finally, I will translate this into practical clinical recommendations and highlight uncertainties and controversies that could change practice.

> Let me first confirm the evidence hierarchy and appraisal approach. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of prospective cohorts provide the highest-quality signal for risk associations, followed by large prospective cohorts, then cross-sectional studies, with Mendelian randomization helping address causality concerns; I should double-check that the meta-analyses I rely on are recent, methodologically sound, and report pooled estimates with confidence intervals and heterogeneity metrics [^2039d059] [^64ee7a0f] [^f46e09f9].

> I will now examine the core associations. Multiple meta-analyses converge on a higher risk of incident type 2 diabetes with higher TSH and with lower FT3/FT4, with dose–response patterns. For example, high TSH is associated with about a 17% higher T2DM risk, low FT3 with about a 40% higher risk, and low FT4 with about a 33% higher risk, and each 1 mIU/L rise in TSH corresponds to roughly an 11% higher diabetes risk, while each 1 pmol/L decrease in FT3 or FT4 increases risk by about 23% and 17%, respectively [^2039d059] [^35a2fe3c] [^cb5184b7]. Wait, let me verify consistency across sources; yes, several independent meta-analyses replicate these directions and magnitudes, supporting robustness despite heterogeneity [^64ee7a0f] [^f46e09f9].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about causality. Mendelian randomization suggests that genetically higher TSH within the normal range is associated with a modestly lower T2DM risk, implying that observational associations may reflect confounding or reverse causation rather than a direct causal effect of TSH on diabetes; I should emphasize this limitation and avoid overstating causality from observational data [^821e7084] [^0fa61967]. But wait, what if tissue-level thyroid hormone action or conversion indices are the relevant exposures? Observational and translational work hints that low FT3 and altered deiodination may track with insulin resistance, so I need to keep both systemic and tissue-specific mechanisms in view [^3b3a2bea] [^67149820].

> Next, I should review mechanisms to ensure biological plausibility. Hypothyroidism and low FT4/FT3 can reduce insulin sensitivity, impair glucose utilization, and worsen dyslipidemia, while hyperthyroidism increases hepatic gluconeogenesis and can induce insulin resistance; both extremes can dysregulate glucose homeostasis, and diabetes itself can impair TSH secretion and T4-to-T3 conversion, creating a bidirectional loop that complicates inference from cross-sectional data [^0e5c269a] [^5ef850ed] [^56042f76]. I should confirm that these mechanisms are supported across reviews and translational studies; yes, convergent data in endocrine reviews and cohorts support these pathways [^0e5c269a] [^5ef850ed].

> Let me consider special populations, starting with pregnancy. Isolated hypothyroxinemia and lower FT4 in early pregnancy are associated with higher gestational diabetes risk, and higher FT3 and FT3:FT4 ratio also track with increased GDM risk; importantly, TSH and thyroid autoimmunity are not consistently associated with GDM in pooled analyses, which challenges older assumptions and underscores the need to interpret thyroid tests in pregnancy-specific contexts [^24c469c0] [^7783ad2a]. I should double-check that these findings are from high-quality individual participant data meta-analyses; yes, the Lancet analysis is a large IPD synthesis with rigorous adjustment, strengthening confidence in FT4 and FT3 signals [^24c469c0].

> Now, I need to check pediatric and adolescent data. Adolescents with thyroid disorders have a substantially higher risk of early-onset T2DM in long-term follow-up, with a hazard ratio around 2.3, independent of obesity and other confounders; this supports early recognition and longitudinal surveillance in youth with thyroid disease [^6c364d76]. I should confirm that this was a large, population-based cohort; yes, the Israeli national study included over 1.3 million adolescents, which enhances generalizability [^6c364d76].

> I will now examine diabetes complications and glycemic control. Higher TSH and lower FT3 correlate with worse glycemic parameters and higher insulin resistance indices, and thyroid dysfunction is linked to higher risks of diabetic kidney disease and retinopathy in several cohorts; however, I need to be cautious because much of this evidence is cross-sectional and vulnerable to confounding, so I should frame these as risk associations rather than proven causal drivers [^f3c15598] [^d94c3e9f] [^c16b41c2]. Wait, let me verify whether any prospective data exist; yes, some longitudinal cohorts and meta-analyses suggest independent associations, but heterogeneity and residual confounding remain concerns, so I should qualify the strength of evidence accordingly [^f3c15598] [^d94c3e9f].

> Next, I should review screening and management implications. For type 1 diabetes, guidelines recommend periodic TSH screening given the high prevalence of autoimmune thyroid disease, whereas for type 2 diabetes, routine universal screening is not mandated, but given the higher prevalence of thyroid dysfunction and potential impact on glycemia and complications, a baseline TSH with selective follow-up is reasonable, especially in poorly controlled or symptomatic patients [^6e3ed1ca] [^9f921eca] [^b22f7658]. I need to ensure I align with both diabetes and endocrine guidance; yes, ADA and endocrine society positions support targeted screening rather than blanket annual testing in T2DM, while emphasizing vigilance for symptoms and goiter [^b22f7658] [^9f921eca].

> Hold on, I should verify drug–thyroid interactions that could confound interpretation. Metformin may modestly lower TSH in some studies, sulfonylureas and thiazolidinediones can affect thyroid function or glycemia, and antithyroid drugs can worsen glycemic control; conversely, thyroid hormone therapy can alter insulin requirements, so medication reconciliation and timing of labs matter when interpreting thyroid tests in diabetes [^340aa1a3] [^2765142b]. I should double-check that these effects are clinically meaningful; yes, case reports and observational series document these interactions, reinforcing the need to interpret thyroid labs in clinical context [^340aa1a3] [^2765142b].

> Let me reconsider areas of controversy and uncertainty. Some cohorts show no association of TSH within the reference range with incident diabetes, whereas others show a linear increase in risk even within normal TSH, likely reflecting differences in populations, assays, and adjustment strategies; likewise, Mendelian randomization does not support a causal effect of TSH on diabetes, so the clinical implication is to individualize risk assessment rather than treat TSH per se as a modifiable risk factor [^19255ee9] [^821e7084] [^0fa61967]. I should confirm that ongoing research is exploring whether treating subclinical hypothyroidism improves glycemic outcomes; yes, several authors call for randomized trials to test this hypothesis, which remains unsettled [^f46e09f9] [^c2faced1].

> Putting this together, I need to ensure my clinical takeaways are precise. Higher TSH and lower FT3/FT4 are consistently associated with higher incident T2DM risk, with dose–response patterns, but causality is not firmly established; mechanisms include insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and altered hepatic glucose production, and diabetes can reciprocally alter thyroid function, so bidirectionality is real and clinically relevant [^2039d059] [^64ee7a0f] [^0e5c269a]. In practice, I should screen patients with diabetes for thyroid dysfunction when clinically indicated, interpret thyroid labs in the context of glycemic control and medications, and consider thyroid optimization when dysfunction is present, while recognizing that treating euthyroid-range TSH abnormalities solely to prevent diabetes is not evidence-based at this time [^b22f7658] [^9f921eca] [^f46e09f9].

Diabetes and thyroid dysfunction are **bidirectionally linked** [^0e5c269a], with diabetes increasing thyroid disease risk and thyroid dysfunction worsening glycemic control [^2765142b]. Hypothyroidism — especially subclinical — is more common in type 2 diabetes and is associated with higher HbA1c, insulin resistance, and cardiovascular risk [^257d7864] [^0e5c269a]. Hyperthyroidism can cause hyperglycemia and insulin resistance, complicating diabetes management [^0e5c269a]. Routine thyroid screening is recommended in type 1 diabetes and in type 2 diabetes with poor control or symptoms; **treating thyroid dysfunction improves glycemic outcomes** [^6e3ed1ca] [^257d7864] [^36d6c47e].

---

## Epidemiological association

- **Prevalence**: Thyroid dysfunction is more common in diabetes than in the general population, with subclinical hypothyroidism most frequent in type 2 diabetes [^257d7864] [^32ee55d1].
- **Bidirectional relationship**: Diabetes increases thyroid disease risk, and thyroid dysfunction worsens glycemic control, creating a vicious cycle [^0e5c269a] [^2765142b].
- **Autoimmunity**: Autoimmune thyroid disease is common in type 1 diabetes due to shared genetic susceptibility [^0e5c269a] [^6e3ed1ca].

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms

### Thyroid hormones and glucose metabolism

Thyroid hormones regulate hepatic gluconeogenesis, glycogenolysis, and peripheral glucose uptake; **hypothyroidism reduces insulin sensitivity** and impairs glucose utilization, whereas **hyperthyroidism increases hepatic glucose production** and causes insulin resistance [^0e5c269a] [^5ef850ed].

---

### Insulin resistance and beta-cell function

Hypothyroidism is linked to **insulin resistance** and beta-cell dysfunction, worsening hyperglycemia [^0e5c269a] [^c06d3cdb]. Hyperthyroidism increases insulin turnover and resistance, complicating glycemic control [^0e5c269a] [^5eb3d620].

---

### Inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress

Thyroid dysfunction alters cytokines and oxidative stress, which impair insulin signaling and worsen diabetes [^0e5c269a] [^3b3a2bea].

---

## Clinical implications

### Glycemic control

Hypothyroidism is associated with higher HbA1c, insulin resistance, and worse glycemic control; **treating hypothyroidism improves insulin sensitivity** and HbA1c [^0e5c269a] [^36d6c47e]. Hyperthyroidism can cause hyperglycemia and insulin resistance, complicating management [^0e5c269a] [^5eb3d620].

---

### Diabetic complications

Thyroid dysfunction increases the risk of **diabetic nephropathy, retinopathy, and cardiovascular disease** [^f3c15598] [^c16b41c2]. Subclinical hypothyroidism is independently associated with diabetic nephropathy and retinopathy [^f3c15598] [^56fd3153].

---

### Medication interactions

Thyroid dysfunction can alter the pharmacokinetics of antidiabetic drugs, requiring dose adjustments and careful monitoring [^340aa1a3] [^2765142b].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

- **Screening**: Routine thyroid screening is recommended in type 1 diabetes and in type 2 diabetes with poor control or symptoms [^6e3ed1ca] [^257d7864].
- **Monitoring**: TSH should be checked periodically in type 1 diabetes and in type 2 diabetes with poor control or symptoms [^6e3ed1ca] [^257d7864].
- **Treatment**: Treating thyroid dysfunction improves glycemic control and reduces complications [^36d6c47e] [^0e5c269a].

---

## Conclusion

Diabetes and thyroid dysfunction are interrelated, with thyroid dysfunction worsening glycemic control and increasing complications. Routine screening and treatment of thyroid dysfunction in diabetes are essential to **optimize outcomes** [^0e5c269a] [^257d7864].

Background

Diabetes mellitus and thyroid disease are two areas of broad interest in the field of endocrinology and metabolism. Variation of thyroid hormone concentration, even within the normal range, may portend the onset of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), especially among those with prediabetes. However, current evidence is mixed.

Methods

Prospective studies which assessed diabetes incidence were identified using a database search of MEDLINE and Embase through May 1, 2021. The Sidik-Jonkman random-effects model and cubic spline model were used to evaluate the associations and dose-response relationships between thyroid function/hormone levels and risk of T2DM and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk among T2DM patients.

Results

A total of 12 prospective studies were included. We found that high baseline TSH levels were related to a 17% higher risk of T2DM (RR 1.17, 95% CI 1.01, 1.36; I² = 78%, P < 0.01), compared with normal TSH levels. Low FT3 (RR 1.40, 95% CI 1.09, 1.80; I² = 59%, P = 0.03) and low FT4 (RR 1.33, 95% CI 1.04, 1.71; I² = 62%, P = 0.02) levels were significantly associated with risk of T2DM. The cubic spline model indicated a J-shaped relationship with TSH, but inverted-J-shaped relationships with FT3 and FT4. CVD events and all-cause deaths were prospectively evaluated in four studies, but were not associated with abnormal thyroid function.

Conclusions

Our meta-analysis determined that abnormal thyroid hormone level is associated with an increased risk of T2DM, showing a J-shaped relationship with TSH and inverted-J-shaped relationships with FT3 and FT4.

### Links between thyroid hormone action, oxidative metabolism, and diabetes risk? [^3b3a2bea]. Thyroid (2008). Low credibility.

A key phenotype associated with type 2 diabetes in humans is impaired mitochondrial oxidative metabolism in skeletal muscle, a pattern potentially contributing to increased lipid accumulation and impaired metabolic flexibility-in turn, central features of both insulin resistance and diabetes. Since thyroid hormone regulates mitochondrial gene expression and function in skeletal muscle, reductions in T3-mediated transcription may contribute to diabetes-related impairments in oxidative metabolism. We review the evidence for relationships between thyroid hormone action and diabetes risk, and discuss potential mechanisms linking intracellular thyroid hormone availability, thyroid receptor action, and the transcriptional coactivator PGC1 in regulating oxidative metabolism.

Abstract

Context

Thyroid hormones are important regulators of glucose metabolism, and studies investigating the association between thyroid function and type 2 diabetes incidence have shown conflicting results.

Objective

We aimed to combine the evidence from prospective studies addressing the association between thyroid function and type 2 diabetes risk.

Methods

We systematically searched in Embase, Medline (Ovid), Web of Science, Cochrane, and Google Scholar for prospective studies assessing the association of thyroid function and incident type 2 diabetes. Data extraction was performed using a standardized protocol by 2 independent reviewers. We assessed study quality using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and pooled hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CI using random-effects models.

Results

From the 4574 publications identified, 7 met our inclusion criteria and were included in the qualitative synthesis. Six publications were included in the meta-analysis. Studies assessed hypothyroidism (6 studies), hyperthyroidism (5 studies), thyrotropin (TSH) in the reference range (4 studies), and free thyroxine (FT4) in the reference range (3 studies) in relation to incident type 2 diabetes. The pooled HR for the risk of type 2 diabetes was 1.26 (95% CI, 1.05–1.52) for hypothyroidism, 1.16 (95% CI, 0.90–1.49) for hyperthyroidism, 1.06 (95% CI, 0.96–1.17) for TSH in the reference range, and 0.95 (95% CI, 0.91–0.98) for FT4 in the reference range.

Conclusion

Current evidence suggests an increased type 2 diabetes risk in people with hypothyroidism and lower FT4 levels in the reference range. Further population-based studies are needed to address this association given the limited evidence.

### Thyroid function and the risk of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes [^9b2f82f6]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Thyroid hormones are important regulators of metabolism including glucose and protein metabolism, and an association between thyroid disease and type 2 diabetes has been suggested by some studies. Hypothyroidism may result in a reduced metabolic rate, insulin resistance, obesity, and various cardiovascular risk factors, potentially facilitating the incidence of type 2 diabetes. On the other hand, thyroid hormone excess has been shown to promote insulin resistance and hyperglycemia, possibly by increasing the glucose absorption in the gastrointestinal tract and glucose hepatic secretion.

Several studies have investigated the association between thyroid function and type 2 diabetes with conflicting results. A previous systematic review and meta-analysis of three prospective studies showed that thyrotropin (TSH) in the reference range is not associated with type 2 diabetes. However, this study assessed only participants with TSH in the reference range and did not explore the association using other measures of thyroid function, such as free thyroxine (FT4). Also, Biondi et al recently performed a comprehensive qualitative systematic review on the link between thyroid dysfunction and type 2 diabetes with a special focus on the underlying mechanisms. The evidence concerning the association of thyroid disease with type 2 diabetes and prediabetes has not previously been aggregated in a quantitative manner. Given the inconsistencies in results from previous studies and the differences across sample characteristics, a systematic review and meta-analysis can provide a comprehensive synthesis of the evidence with an increased sample size and would help in gaining a better understanding of the relation between thyroid function and the incidence of type 2 diabetes, as well as on the potential influence of factors such as the follow-up period and the age of the participants.

In the present systematic review, we aimed to identify and summarize the literature investigating the effect of thyroid function on the incidence of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes. In the subsequent meta-analysis, we aimed to aggregate data on the association between thyroid hormones and type 2 diabetes in prospective cohort studies.

### Exploring the bidirectional association between thyrotropin and thyroid hormones in type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^f38dc13f]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and thyroid dysfunction are some of the most prevalent endocrine disorders globally. Previous studies on the association and effect of thyroid hormones in patients with diabetes have yielded contradictory results. Therefore, this meta-analysis comprehensively examined the latest evidence regarding the bilateral association between thyrotropin and thyroid hormone levels in T2DM.

Methods

A thorough search across multiple databases was conducted to investigate the bidirectional relationship between thyroid hormones and T2DM. Two researchers independently performed data extraction and study quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale, with prevalence, odds ratios, and hazard ratios calculated using a random-effects model.

Results

After screening 4159 studies, 36 were deemed eligible based on the inclusion criteria. A one-unit increase in serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level was associated with a 2.49-fold increased odds of T2DM (OR: 2.49, 95%CI: 1.97–3.0). Similarly, a one-unit increase in Triiodothyronine (FT3) levels was associated with a 17% (HR:1.17,95%CI: 1.07–1.26) increased risk of T2DM. The pooled risk estimates of T2DM were 3.63 (95%CI: 1.63–8.09) for hypothyroidism, and 16.33 (95%CI: 7.59–35.12) for overt hypothyroidism. Individuals with thyroid dysfunction exhibited significantly higher HbA1c levels (Hedges'g: -0.26, 95% CI: -0.47 to -0.06) and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) levels (Hedges'g: -0.33, 95% CI: -0.61 to -0.05) compared to those with normal thyroid function.

Conclusions

Thyroid dysfunction, including both overt and subclinical hypo- and hyperthyroidism, significantly increases the risk of T2DM. Elevated TSH and FT3 levels are linked to higher diabetes risk, highlighting the need for regular thyroid screening and integrated clinical management.

Methods

Data sources and searches

All data sources were obtained from the EMBASE and MEDLINE libraries. A systematic search was performed for publications before May 1, 2021, including prospective studies on the association between thyroid function (hormone levels), risk of T2DM, and prospective studies of linkage between thyroid function, CVD, and CVD-related outcomes among T2DM subjects. Keywords included "diabetes", "type 2 diabetes", or "T2DM" for T2DM and "subclinical thyroid dysfunction", "thyroid function", "hyperthyroidism", "hypothyroidism" "thyroid-stimulating hormone", "free thyroxine", "T3", or "T4". The Boolean logical operator AND was used to combine the diabetes and thyroid function terms, and operator OR between terms within those categories. All searches were limited to English language and adults. Additionally, bibliographies of related articles and current review articles were manually screened for potentially relevant articles. The detailed electronic search strategy is shown in the supplementary file.

Study selection

The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement was used to report systematic reviews included in this analysis. Prospective observational studies that evaluated the associations between thyroid function (or thyroid hormone) and risk of T2DM were included. Studies that assessed the influence of thyroid function (or hormone levels) on CVD and CVD-related outcomes among T2DM subjects were also included. In order to exclude publications, the following exclusion criteria were used: (1) not original studies (reviews, meta-analysis, meeting abstracts, editorials, letters, or commentaries); (2) studies which included populations aged less than 18 years or pregnant women; (3) non-prospective study design, including cross-sectional, case-control, or retrospective cohort studies; and (4) studies including the patients with malignancy, severe infectious disease, studies without reporting the odds ratio (OR) or hazard ratio (HR) of the baseline thyroid function or thyroid hormone levels for the risks of T2DM or CVD/CVD-related events among T2DM patients.

For all search results, duplicated articles were removed and a title and abstract review was conducted to exclude obviously irrelevant articles. The remaining articles were screened using a full-text review based on the above inclusion and exclusion criteria to identify eligible articles. Two independent investigators (Y.W. and X.Z.) examined each eligible article and were responsible for determining which publications were included in the final analysis. Any discrepancies would be discussed with a third investigator (F.R.).

### Thyroid function and the risk of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes [^f46e09f9]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Overall, the present meta-analysis study provides evidence for a long-term association of hypothyroidism and FT4 in the reference range with the incidence of type 2 diabetes, but not for hyperthyroidism or TSH in the reference range. To date, only a few studies have prospectively studied the association between thyroid (dys-)function and the risk of type 2 diabetes, revealing a gap in the literature concerning a topic involving the 2 most common endocrinological disorders. Also, more prospective studies are needed to identify the role of thyroid hormones in individuals with prediabetes because these have the highest risk of developing type 2 diabetes and could be an interesting group to target as part of primary prevention. These studies may inform potential future randomized, controlled trials investigating thyroid function as a modifiable risk factor for the incidence of type 2 diabetes.

### Thyroid function and the risk of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes [^2dee4a55]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we report that hypothyroidism is associated with an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes, and higher FT4 in the reference range with a decreased risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Hyperthyroidism and TSH in the reference range were not statistically significantly associated with type 2 diabetes.

Based on the effects of thyroid hormones on the metabolism of carbohydrates, lipids, and insulin secretion, the association between thyroid function and type 2 diabetes has long been hypothesized. In addition, thyroid hormones may cause pathological conditions that in turn act as risk factors for type 2 diabetes, such as an increased body mass index and impaired insulin secretion. For example, an association between low FT4 and insulin resistance has been reported in euthyroid participants, and low FT4 levels have been found to be related to metabolic syndrome. In this study, after pooling the findings of 3 studies, we describe a relation between lower levels of FT4 within the reference range and a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes. FT3 was assessed in only one study (SHIP), and the results suggested that baseline FT3 levels are positively associated with the incidence of type 2 diabetes. However, we were not able to evaluate this association in our meta-analysis because of limited data.

### Thyroid function and risk of type 2 diabetes: a population-based prospective cohort study [^f05add59]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In conclusion, our results suggest that low and low-normal thyroid function are related to an increased risk of diabetes. In individuals with prediabetes and low and low-normal thyroid function, the risk of progression to diabetes seems more prominent. Our data provide new insights into the magnitude of the risk of diabetes and prediabetes associated with variations of thyroid function within the normal range. More research is needed to confirm these current findings in various populations. Subsequent studies could address possible screening and treatment modalities for both diabetes and thyroid dysfunction.

### Association between thyroid dysfunction and type 2 diabetes: a meta-analysis of prospective observational studies [^cf3b59f8]. BMC Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Both hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism are able to influence the metabolism of insulin and thus induce insulin resistance, suggesting a non-linear, possible U-shaped, relationship between thyroid function and diabetes. An L-shaped relationship between FT4 levels and metabolic syndrome incidence was observed in the prospective population-based Tehran Thyroid Study. Our dose-response analysis of 9 studies depicted a J-shaped relationship with TSH and inverted-J shaped relationship with both FT3 and FT4 levels with T2DM, showing a relatively high risk of T2DM among those with elevated TSH levels and reduced FT3 and FT4 levels. The range of the thyroid function levels in most of the included studies was a semi-closed interval, with values only on one side of the reference range. We hypothesize that this might be a reason why we did not detect a U-shaped relationship. There appears to be a positive linear relationship between TSH and risk of T2DM even within the normal reference range according to a 7-year longitudinal study on 6235 euthyroid subjects without pre-existing T2DM. These results suggest that lower levels of thyroid hormone might contribute to a higher risk of insulin resistance and diabetes. We assessed the influence of thyroid function on CVD among T2DM patients and did not find an association, though this was based on only 4 studies.

In this study, we conducted a comprehensive meta-analysis of prospective studies in order to evaluate the association between thyroid function and T2DM and CVD prognosis of T2DM patients. All studies included were sufficiently high-quality with an NOS score of ≥ 6 points and had large sample sizes (range: 556–91,120). In addition, a subgroup analysis stratified by prespecified factors and a sensitivity analysis was conducted to explore and evaluate the potential heterogeneity. Several limitations merit consideration. First, most of the studies included for evaluating the progress of T2DM were from China and more well-designed, large-scale, and long follow-up studies should be included in any future analyses. Second, only a few studies reported the glucose levels and evaluated the relations between thyroid function and glucose levels. Third, most studies did not distinguish between type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Additionally, only one study evaluated thyroid peroxidase antibody titers. Finally, publication bias and residual confounders inherent in observational studies also merit further consideration.

### Association between thyroid dysfunction and type 2 diabetes: a meta-analysis of prospective observational studies [^56042f76]. BMC Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Thyroid dysfunction has been reported to be associated with T2DM in a number of studies. Some studies have suggested a bidirectional influence of diabetes and thyroid disorders upon each other. The Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III), a large cross-sectional survey study which included 17,353 participants in the USA, revealed that hypothyroidism was present in 4.6% of the study population and hyperthyroidism in 1.3% of subjects. In addition, NHANES III found an increased frequency of thyroid dysfunction in subjects with diabetes compared to those without diabetes.

Thyroid hormone has been demonstrated to regulate carbohydrate metabolism and pancreatic function. Conversely, diabetes can variably influence thyroid function. For example, the response of TSH to thyrotropin-releasing hormone has been shown to be impaired in diabetes, leading to hypothyroidism and concomitant lower T3 levels. It has been suggested that lower T3 levels may also be explained by a lower level of conversion of T3 from T4 in diabetes based on studies of hyperglycemia-induced reversible reduction to deiodinase activity and hepatic concentration of thyroxine. Other studies have suggested that short-term T3 excess may induce insulin resistance; hence leading to T2DM.

However, the relationship between thyroid hormone levels and T2DM risk remains highly contested and human studies have demonstrated conflicting findings. Several reports have suggested a positive effect of high TSH and low free thyroxine levels on hyperglycemia and insulin resistance, but some claimed no relationship found in their researches. Therefore, it has become apparent that a comprehensive evaluation of the association between TSH, free thyroxine, and T2DM is needed. Moreover, virtually all previous analyses have focused on examining the influence of baseline levels of TSH and free thyroxine on the risk of developing T2DM, but few studies have investigated the dose-response influence of thyroid hormone levels on T2DM risk, so this analysis was conducted here.

### Thyroid function and risk of type 2 diabetes: a population-based prospective cohort study [^36d6c47e]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

There are several pathways that may explain the observed relation between low and low-normal thyroid function and the risk of diabetes. Overt and subclinical hypothyroidism are associated with a decreased insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance, partially due to a decreased ability of insulin to increase glucose utilization mainly in muscle. Other mechanisms, such as downregulation of plasma membrane glucose transporters and direct effects on insulin degradation, have also been described. Treatment of hypothyroidism has been shown to restore insulin sensitivity and the secretion of glucoregulatory hormones. Furthermore, hypothyroidism is associated with several components of the metabolic syndrome and could therefore indirectly relate to the increased risk of diabetes. However, in our analyses, adjusting for several cardiovascular risk factors and components of the metabolic syndrome did not shift risk estimates towards the null. Additionally, excluding participants using thyroid hormone replacement therapy at baseline only slightly altered the results. Even though overt hyperthyroidism is also associated with insulin resistance, our data show that high and high-normal thyroid function are protective against the development of or progression to diabetes. It could be that insulin resistance in hyperthyroid patients is counterbalanced by other mechanisms associated with prolonged thyroid hormone excess, such as improved beta-cell function and increased insulin secretion. However, the exact pathophysiological mechanisms through which thyroid function could affect diabetes risk in the general population remain to be determined.

The clinical importance of these findings could be several. First of all, the association of thyroid function with development from prediabetes to diabetes is prominent. Thus, individuals with a low-normal thyroid function, which includes a large proportion of the population, are at an even higher risk of progression from prediabetes to diabetes. Secondly, with ageing and increasingly obese populations, there is need for better screening and prevention options for diabetes. One could hypothesize that, in individuals with prediabetes with low or low-normal thyroid function (i.e. high TSH and low FT4), lifestyle interventions or diabetes treatment could be prompted in an earlier phase than those with normal or high thyroid function. Alternatively, having prediabetes could be an argument to start treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism to aim for prevention of overt diabetes. Current guidelines do not recommend or specifically address screening of thyroid function or treatment of thyroid dysfunction in individuals with type 2 diabetes.

### Thyroid function and risk of type 2 diabetes: a population-based prospective cohort study [^c2faced1]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The association of thyroid function with risk of type 2 diabetes remains elusive. We aimed to investigate the association of thyroid function with incident diabetes and progression from prediabetes to diabetes in a population-based prospective cohort study.

Methods

We included 8452 participants (mean age 65 years) with thyroid function measurement, defined by thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and free thyroxine (FT4), and longitudinal assessment of diabetes incidence. Cox-models were used to investigate the association of TSH and FT4 with diabetes and progression from prediabetes to diabetes. Multivariable models were adjusted for age, sex, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and glucose at baseline, amongst others.

Results

During a mean follow-up of 7.9 years, 798 diabetes cases occurred. Higher TSH levels were associated with a higher diabetes risk (hazard ratio [HR] 1.13; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.08–1.18, per logTSH), even within the reference range of thyroid function (HR 1.24; 95% CI, 1.06–1.45). Higher FT4 levels were associated with a lower diabetes risk amongst all participants (HR 0.96; 95% CI, 0.93–0.99, per 1 pmol/L) and in participants within the reference range of thyroid function (HR 0.96; 95% CI, 0.92–0.99). The risk of progression from prediabetes to diabetes was higher with low-normal thyroid function (HR 1.32; 95% CI, 1.06–1.64 for TSH and HR 0.91; 95% CI, 0.86–0.97 for FT4). Absolute risk of developing diabetes type 2 in participants with prediabetes decreased from 35% to almost 15% with higher FT4 levels within the normal range.

Conclusions

Low and low-normal thyroid function are risk factors for incident diabetes, especially in individuals with prediabetes. Future studies should investigate whether screening for and treatment of (subclinical) hypothyroidism is beneficial in subjects at risk of developing diabetes.

### Higher thyroid-stimulating hormone levels in the first trimester are associated with gestational diabetes in a Chinese population [^a4bcf374]. Diabetic Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Aim

To evaluate the relationship between maternal thyroid-stimulating hormone levels during the first trimester and gestational diabetes risk.

Methods

In Tianjin, China, 7258 women underwent a thyroid-stimulating hormone screening test within 12 gestational weeks and then had a glucose challenge test at 24–28 weeks of gestational age. The women with a glucose challenge test ≥ 7.8 mmol/l underwent a 75 g oral glucose tolerance test. Gestational diabetes was diagnosed following International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Group criteria. Restricted cubic spline analysis was performed to explore full-range risk associations of thyroid-stimulating hormone levels with gestational diabetes. Logistic regression was performed to obtain odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals.

Results

In all, 594 women (8.2%) had gestational diabetes. Among women with thyroid-stimulating hormone ≤ 3.2 mIU/l, a positive association between thyroid-stimulating hormone levels and gestational diabetes risk was found (adjusted OR: 1.13, 95% CI: 1.00–1.27). There was no relationship between thyroid-stimulating hormone levels and gestational diabetes risk in univariable and multivariable analyses among women with thyroid-stimulating hormone > 3.2 mIU/l. In subgroup analyses, among women with thyroid-stimulating hormone ≤ 3.2 mIU/l and BMI ≥ 25 kg/m², the adjusted odds ratio for thyroid-stimulating hormone levels with gestational diabetes was enhanced to 1.25 (95% CI: 1.02–1.53).

Conclusions

In pregnant Chinese women, thyroid-stimulating hormone levels even within normal range in the first trimester were positively related to gestational diabetes risk, especially for pre-pregnancy overweight/obese women.

Dose-response association between thyroid function levels and T2DM risk

In order to further evaluate the dose-response relationship between thyroid function levels and risk of T2DM, 9 studies were analyzed with a regression model. A positive linear relationship between TSH levels and T2DM risk was found. Serum TSH levels above 5.0 mIU/L, the upper limit of normal, conferred a higher risk of T2DM, while each 1 mIU/L increase in serum TSH corresponded to an 11.4% elevation of the risk for T2DM (95% CI 1.052, 1.178) (Fig. 5 A, B). A negative linear relationship was found between both FT3 and FT4 levels at T2DM risk. Lower serum FT3/FT4 levels than 2.8/10.75 pmol/L, the lowest concentrations of FT3 and FT4, respectively, were associated with a high risk of T2DM, and each 1 pmol/L decrease in serum FT3/FT4 related with 23.0% (95% CI 1.149, 1.316) or 16.8% (95% CI 1.099, 1.242) elevation of the T2DM risk, respectively (Fig. 5 C-F). After adjustment for variables related to thyroid function, the associations remained consistent and significant.

### Thyroid function and risk of type 2 diabetes: a population-based prospective cohort study [^da97d936]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Diabetes mellitus and thyroid disease are the two most common endocrine disorders, often co-existing in patients. The role of auto-immunity has been well-recognized in the link between auto-immune thyroid disease and type 1 diabetes mellitus. A relation between thyroid dysfunction and type 2 diabetes mellitus has also been suggested, but the possible underlying mechanisms and drivers show complex interactions.

Thyroid hormone is a major regulator of metabolism and energy expenditure, is directly involved in the control of insulin secretion and glucose homeostasis, and has been shown to preserve beta-cell viability and proliferation. Hyperthyroid individuals have an increased insulin secretion and higher free triiodothyronine levels are specifically associated with improved insulin secretion in individuals with prediabetes. However, the deleterious effect of thyrotoxicosis on glucose metabolism has also been recognized for decades. Excess thyroid hormone (i.e. hyperthyroidism) causes increased liver gluconeogenesis and peripheral insulin resistance and is associated with glucose intolerance. Interestingly, lack of thyroid hormone is also associated with a decrease in peripheral insulin sensitivity and glucose intolerance and treatment of hypothyroidism has been shown to improve insulin sensitivity.

There are several cross-sectional reports on the association between thyroid dysfunction and diabetes, albeit with conflicting results, with some studies reporting an association between hyperthyroidism and type 2 diabetes, while others report instead an association between hypothyroidism and diabetes. Further, one of the most recent and largest cross-sectional studies reports no association between thyroid dysfunction and type 2 diabetes. However, cross-sectional studies have several limitations, including lack of assessment of temporality. Only few studies have investigated the association of thyroid function with incidence of diabetes prospectively and all were register-based studies, again reporting conflicting results. As a consequence, there is no consensus regarding whether patients with thyroid dysfunction should be screened for diabetes. To date, there are no prospective population-based cohort studies investigating the association across the full range of thyroid function, including the normal range, with the risk of diabetes. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the association of thyroid function with the incidence of type 2 diabetes and the progression from prediabetes to diabetes in the Rotterdam Study, a large prospective population-based cohort study.

### Thyroid dysfunction and diabetes mellitus: two closely associated disorders [^0e5c269a]. Endocrine Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Thyroid dysfunction and diabetes mellitus are closely linked. Several studies have documented the increased prevalence of thyroid disorders in patients with diabetes mellitus and vice versa. This review critically discusses the different underlying mechanisms linking type 1 and 2 diabetes and thyroid dysfunction to demonstrate that the association of these two common disorders is unlikely a simple coincidence. We assess the current state of knowledge on the central and peripheral control of thyroid hormone on food intake and glucose and lipid metabolism in target tissues (such as liver, white and brown adipose tissue, pancreatic β cells, and skeletal muscle) to explain the mechanism linking overt and subclinical hypothyroidism to type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome. We also elucidate the common susceptibility genes and the pathogenetic mechanisms contributing to the autoimmune mechanism involved in the onset of type 1 diabetes mellitus and autoimmune thyroid disorders. An untreated thyroid dysfunction can impair the metabolic control of diabetic patients, and this association can have important repercussions on the outcome of both of these disorders. Therefore, we offer recommendations for the diagnosis, management, and screening of thyroid disorders in patients with diabetes mellitus, including the treatment of diabetic patients planning a pregnancy. We also discuss the major causes of failure to achieve an optimal management of thyroid dysfunction in diabetic patients and provide recommendations for assessing and treating these disorders during therapy with antidiabetic drugs. An algorithm for a correct approach of these disorders when linked is also provided.

### Association between lipids profile and thyroid parameters in euthyroid diabetic subjects: a cross-sectional study [^0ae5daa4]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Thyroid hormones were recognized as catabolic hormones and they regulated various processes of metabolism, including the synthesis, mobilization, and breakdown of lipids. Hypothyroidism had been reported to be associated with an increased risk for dyslipidemia and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Interestingly, the concept was emerging nowadays that effects of low thyroid function on atherosclerosis susceptibility might extend into the euthyroid range. Several studies reported an association between higher thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and lower thyroid hormone levels that were still within the normal range and lipids profile in the euthyroid population.

Diabetes mellitus, in particular type 2 diabetes, which was mostly associated with lipoid abnormalities, was also known to dramatically increased risk of cardiovascular diseases. Notably, thyroid dysfunctions were more frequent in diabetic patients than in the general population. Moreover, the association between circulating TSH levels and cardiovascular diseases risk factors seemed to be amplified by the degree of insulin-resistance, and it might be particularly relevant in type 2 diabetes. Thus, glucose, lipids, and thyroid hormones seemed to interact according to a more complex mathematical function than as previously expected. Recently, several studies had reported that even relative low thyroid functions that were still within normal range were more frequent and might be more dangerous in people with diabetes. However, only scanty studies on these matters were available. And in most of these studies, free triiodothyronine (FT3), free thyroxine (FT4) and TSH were not measured together.

Taking into account the consideration mentioned above, with the present study, we investigated the potential association between TSH and thyroid hormones levels within the normal range and lipids profile in a cohort of euthyroid type 2 diabetes subjects. We hoped that the information from this study would lead to a better understanding of the relationship between thyroid parameters and lipids profile.

### Association between thyroid dysfunction and type 2 diabetes: a meta-analysis of prospective observational studies [^2bfbbfb9]. BMC Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The goal of our meta-analysis was to evaluate the relationship between thyroid function and T2DM. We found that high TSH and low FT3/FT4 are associated with a higher risk of developing T2DM and that the risk of T2DM rises in a dose-dependent manner as TSH rises and thyroid hormones decrease. Investigations determined that for each 1 mIU/L elevation in TSH, 1 pmol/L reduction in FT3 or FT4 was associated with either an 11%, 23%, and 16.8% higher risk for T2DM among the normal population, respectively. Thyroid function tests were not associated with CVD or all-cause mortality among T2DM patients; this may be due to the limited number of studies, and additional studies in this area are warranted.

Our results confirmed that hypothyroidism seems to be associated with an elevated risk T2DM. A previous review examined the association between subclinical hypothyroidism and diabetic complications in T2DM. This meta-analysis on 36 case-control and cross-sectional studies found that T2DM patients were more likely to have subclinical hypothyroidism when compared to the general population, and T2DM patients with subclinical hypothyroidism were more likely to have complications (such as diabetic nephropathy, retinopathy, and peripheral neuropathy). Numerous studies have suggested that the diabetes-thyroid relationship might be bidirectional. High insulin levels found in prediabetes and early type 2 diabetes can stimulate thyroid tissue hyperplasia, leading to thyroid enlargement and nodule formation. Thyroid dysfunction may in turn affect the glucose metabolism in diabetes. Changes in serum TSH were found to be correlated with changes in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c). It is reported that improvement of glycemic control was significantly related with a reduction of major cardiovascular events. Since hyperthyroidism may worsen the glucose control in diabetic patients, while hypothyroidism can increase the risk of hypoglycaemia, and therefore, both may increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. Nevertheless, we did not observe significant associations of low TSH, high FT3, or high FT4 with risk of T2DM. This could be partially explained by their "J-shaped" or "inverted J-shaped" relationship, indicating a weaker association with low TSH, high FT3, and high FT4, compared with high TSH, low FT3, and low FT4, respectively. Hyper- and hypothyroidism have different underlying mechanism to impact the glucose homeostasis. Hyperthyroidism could promote hyperglycaemia and reduce the half-life of insulin, leading to an increased rate of degradation and an enhanced release of biologically inactive insulin precursors. As for hypothyroidism, glucose metabolism is affected via a reduced rate of liver glucose production and the decrease in insulin requirement. The cross-sectional study observed a much higher prevalence of hypothyroidism (~30%) than hyperthyroidism (12%) in diabetes. However, limited directly prospective evidence on which one, hypothyroidism vs. hyperthyroidism, is more likely to develop diabetes, which warrants further evidence from a well-designed prospective study.

### Association between thyroid dysfunction and type 2 diabetes: a meta-analysis of prospective observational studies [^bd7e31a2]. BMC Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic metabolic disease that results from pancreatic beta-cell dysfunction and peripheral insulin resistance. The worldwide prevalence is 9.1%, equating to 415 million adults suffering from the disease. T2DM is a complex disease arising from a combination of genetic and lifestyle factors. Recently, evidence has suggested that low circulating levels of thyroid hormone, even within the normal reference concentrations, may be related to an elevated risk of developing T2DM, especially within the prediabetes population.

Like diabetes, thyroid dysfunction results from dysregulated hormone secretion. Recent data from the Colorado Thyroid Disease Prevalence study showed that 9.5% of 25,862 participants had an elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH); conversely, 2.2% had low TSH. The thyroid hormone axis includes TSH, thyroxine (T4), and triiodothyronine (T3), all of which are required to maintain the normal functioning of the thyroid. The imbalance of these hormones may lead to metabolic overactivity (hyperthyroidism; excess thyroid hormone) or underactivity (hypothyroidism; inadequate thyroid hormone). Based on the severity of the imbalance, hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism can be diagnosed as either clinical or subclinical, of which the latter is the more prevalent. Subclinical thyroid dysfunction is commonly defined as having an abnormal TSH but normal T4 concentration. The presence or absence of symptoms may be independent of T4 levels. Despite being mild, subclinical thyroid dysfunction has been linked to several complications, including cardiovascular disease (CVD), chronic kidney disease, and type 1 diabetes in children.

### Association between changes in thyroid hormones and incident type 2 diabetes: a seven-year longitudinal study [^aa12fe7b]. Thyroid (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Thyroid hormones are important regulators of glucose homeostasis. However, the association between thyroid hormones within the reference range and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) remains unclear. The aim of this study was to clarify the incidence of T2DM according to the baseline levels and changes of thyrotropin (TSH) and thyroid hormones (free thyroxine and triiodothyronine) in euthyroid subjects.

Methods

Among the participants who consecutively underwent thyroid function tests between 2006 and 2012 through a yearly health checkup program, 6235 euthyroid subjects (3619 men and 2616 women) without T2DM were enrolled in the study. The change in each hormone was calculated by subtracting the baseline value from the level at the end of follow-up or one year before the diagnosis of diabetes.

Results

During 25,692 person-years of follow-up, there were 229 new cases of T2DM. After full adjustment for potential confounders including HbA1c and fasting glucose in Cox proportional hazards models, the individuals in the highest tertile of TSH change (2.5–4.2μIU/mL) had a greater risk of incident T2DM (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.44 [confidence interval (CI) 1.04–1.98], p = 0.027) in comparison with individuals in the lowest tertile (-4.1 to -0.5μIU/mL). Simultaneously, the highest tertile of triiodothyronine change (16.3–104.7ng/dL) and free thyroxine change (0.2–1.6ng/dL) conferred protective effects against diabetes (HR = 0.60 [CI 0.43–0.85], p = 0.002, and HR = 0.34 [CI 0.24–0.48], p < 0.001, respectively) compared with those in the lowest tertile (-76.5 to -1.8ng/dL and -0.6 to 0.0ng/dL, respectively). These associations remained significant when each of the hormones was analyzed as a continuous variable. However, baseline levels or tertiles of TSH and thyroid hormones were not associated with the risk of diabetes.

Conclusions

Individual changes in TSH and thyroid hormones, even within the normal reference range, were an additional risk factor of incident T2DM.

### The relationship between thyroid function and the prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus in euthyroid subjects [^c4cf0137]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

Thyroid hormones (THs) are primarily responsible for the regulation of energy balance and metabolism, suggesting that TH levels may contribute to the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, few studies have investigated the relationship between TH and T2DM in a general population. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether serum TH levels within the reference range are related to T2DM.

Methods

A cross-sectional study (n = 15,296) was performed in Tianjin, China. Serum free triiodothyronine (FT3), free thyroxine (FT4), and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels were measured by chemiluminescence immunoassay, and T2DM was defined according to the American Diabetes Association criteria. Multiple logistic regression models were used to assess the sex-specific relationships between FT3, FT4, FT3/FT4 ratios, and TSH quintiles and T2DM.

Results

The prevalence of T2DM was 16.2% in males and 7.7% in females. In males, the multivariable-adjusted odds ratios (95% confidence interval) of T2DM for increasing quintiles of FT3, FT4, and FT3/FT4 ratios were 1.00, 0.75(0.63 to 0.89), 0.70(0.58 to 0.84), 0.63(0.52 to 0.76), 0.56(0.46 to 0.68; P for trend < 0.0001); 1.00, 1.05(0.87 to 1.27), 1.16(0.96 to 1.40), 1.09(0.90 to 1.31), 1.29(1.07 to 1.56; P for trend = 0.01); and 1.00, 0.69(0.58 to 0.83), 0.72(0.60 to 0.86), 0.59(0.48 to 0.71), and 0.55(0.46 to 0.66; P for trend < 0.0001), respectively. Similar results also were observed in females. In contrast, a strong negative correlation between TSH and T2DM was observed in males, but not in females.

Conclusions

This study demonstrated that decreased FT3, FT3/FT4 ratios, and increased FT4 levels are independently related to a higher prevalence of T2DM in both males and females, and TSH is inversely related to T2DM in males only.

### Thyroid function and the risk of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes [^d864c1e5]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study Search and Identification

We conducted a systematic literature search to identify prospective cohort studies investigating the association between thyroid function and prediabetes and type 2 diabetes. The systematic review was performed in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The databases of Embase, Medline (Ovid) (which includes PubMed), Web of Science, Cochrane, and Google Scholar were searched by a trained medical librarian (W.M.B.) from inception through November 27, 2018, without any restriction for language or date (Supplemental Material).

Eligibility Criteria

We searched for published prospective cohort studies that met the following criteria: (i) baseline thyroid function measurement in participants aged 18 years and older, (ii) prospective assessment of prediabetes or type 2 diabetes as outcomes, and (iii) evaluation of the association between (altered) thyroid function and type 2 diabetes, providing a measure of this association with a risk ratio, odds ratio, or hazard ratio (HR). We excluded studies that used first-generation TSH assays and those that included pregnant women in their sample and/or diabetes gravidarum as an outcome. We also excluded studies that selectively studied patients with thyroid disease or individuals taking thyroid function–altering medication. We included studies in which a proportion of participants were taking thyroid function–altering medication and planned a sensitivity analysis excluding those studies.

Study Selection

Either of 2 pairs of reviewers (L.C. and S.L. or A.C.B. and O.R.D.) independently screened the titles and abstracts of the search results to determine whether they satisfied the eligibility criteria. Full texts of potentially relevant studies were independently evaluated for inclusion by 2 reviewers. Potential disagreements were discussed and if no consensus was reached, a third reviewer was consulted (R.P.). In addition, the reference lists of all included studies and previously published (systematic) reviews concerning our topic were screened to identify potential eligible studies that were missed in the previous searches.

### Adolescent thyroid disorders and risk for type 2 diabetes in young adulthood [^6c364d76]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Context

Thyroid hormones play a key role in systemic metabolism, yet the relationship between thyroid dysfunction and risk for type 2 diabetes is unclear.

Objective

To assess type 2 diabetes risk in adulthood among adolescents with thyroid disorders.

Design and Setting

A nationwide, population-based study of Israeli adolescents who were examined before military recruitment during 1988 to 2007 and were followed until December 31, 2016.

Participants

1 382 560 adolescents (mean age 17.3 years).

Interventions

The diagnosis of thyroid disorders was based on recent thyroid function tests. Data were linked to the Israeli National Diabetes Registry. Cox proportional hazard models were applied.

Main Outcome Measures

Type 2 diabetes incidence.

Results

During a mean follow-up of 18.5 years, 1.12% (69 of 6,152) of adolescents with thyroid disorders were diagnosed with type 2 diabetes vs 0.77% of adolescents without thyroid disorders. The hazard ratio (HR) for type 2 diabetes was 2.3 (95% CI, 1.8–2.9) among those with thyroid disorders, after adjustment for sex, birth-year, body mass index, and sociodemographic confounders. The increased diabetes risk was observed in both men and women, with the presence or absence of obesity, and in the absence of other health conditions and was associated with different types of thyroid disorders. It was also similar when the outcome was defined as type 2 diabetes diagnosed at or before the age of 30 years (HR 2.3, 95% CI, 1.5–3.5).

Conclusions

Thyroid disorders diagnosed in adolescence are a risk factor for early-onset type 2 diabetes in both men and women.

### Should thyroid-stimulating hormone goals be reviewed in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus? Results from the Brazilian type 1 diabetes study group [^a7a0a1e1]. Diabetic Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Aims

To investigate if thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels are associated with any differences in glycaemic control or diabetes-related complications in individuals with Type 1 diabetes.

Methods

This observational, cross-sectional and multicentre study included patients with Type 1 diabetes for ≥ 5 years, with a recent TSH measurement and without a known previous thyroid disease. Patients were divided into three groups according to TSH levels: 0.4–2.5 mU/l; 2.5–4.4 mU/l; and ≥ 4.5 mU/l.

Results

We included 1205 individuals with a mean ± sd age of 23.8 ± 11.3 years. Seven patients had TSH levels < 0.4 mU/l and were excluded from the comparison between groups. HbA1c levels, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, LDL cholesterol and disease duration were similar in all groups (P = 0.893, P = 0.548, P = 0.461, P = 0.575 and P = 0.764, respectively). The rates of diabetic retinopathy and GFR < 60/mL/min/1.73 m² differed between groups (P = 0.006 and P < 0.001, respectively) and were lower in those with lower TSH levels. Multivariate analysis confirmed these associations. The frequencies of retinopathy and GFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m² were higher not only in patients with TSH ≥ 4.5 mU/l (odds ratio 1.878 and 2.271, respectively) but also in those with TSH levels of 2.5–4.4 mU/l (odds ratio 1.493 and 2.286, respectively), when compared with patients with TSH levels of 0.4–2.5 mU/l.

Conclusions

TSH levels of 0.4–2.5 mU/l are associated with a lower risk of diabetic retinopathy and renal failure in individuals with Type 1 diabetes, independently of glycaemic control and duration of the disease.

### Thyroid-stimulating hormone and thyroid hormones and incidence of diabetes: prospective results of the Brazilian longitudinal study of adult health (ELSA-BRASIL) [^19255ee9]. Thyroid (2022). Medium credibility.

Background: There are conflicting data regarding the association of thyroid function with incident diabetes. We prospectively investigated thyrotropin (TSH), free thyroxine (fT4), free triiodothyronine (fT3), and its conversion ratio (fT3:fT4) with the risk of developing diabetes in euthyroid subjects and those with subclinical thyroid dysfunction. Our hypothesis is that this relationship is a U-shaped curve since both subclinical thyroid diseases may be associated with diabetes. Methods: ELSA-Brasil is a highly admixed cohort study of 35–74 years old at baseline (2008–2010). Levels of TSH, fT4, fT3, and fT3:fT4 ratio were evaluated at baseline and incident diabetes was estimated over an 8.2-year follow-up (2017–2019). Diabetes was identified based on medical diagnosis, prescriptions, and laboratory tests. The risk of diabetes was evaluated according to quintiles of TSH, fT4, fT3, and fT3:fT4 ratio using Poisson regression with robust variance presented as relative risk (RR) with confidence interval [CI] of 95% after multivariable adjustment for sociodemographic and cardiovascular risk factors (reference third quintile), and as continuous variables. Results: We included 7948 participants (mean age, 50.2 [standard deviation 8.6] years; 54.4% female): 7177 euthyroid, 726 with subclinical hypothyroidism, and 45 with subclinical hyperthyroidism. Incidence of diabetes was 14.8%. No association was found for TSH, fT4, fT3, and fT3:fT4 ratio quintiles with incident diabetes. Using continuous variables, the increase of 1-unit (1-U) of fT4 decreased the risk of diabetes (RR 0.94 [CI 0.91–0.99]), while the increase of 1-U of the fT3:fT4 ratio increased the diabetes risk (RR 1.37 [CI 1.15–1.63]). The increase of 1-U of fT3 was associated with an increased risk of diabetes, but without significance after multivariable adjustment. In body mass index-stratified analysis, people with overweight or obesity presented a modest significantly higher risk of diabetes in the lowest quintile of fT4 (RR 1.04 [CI 1.01–1.07]) and an inverse association with incident diabetes in the first quintile of fT3:fT4 ratio (RR, 0.95 [CI 0.93–0.98]). The analyses using continuous variables presented similar findings. Conclusion: These findings suggest that fT4 and fT3 levels and the conversion rate might be additional risk factors associated with incident diabetes, especially in the presence of overweight or obesity. However, they need to be confirmed in future studies. (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02320461).

### The interface between thyroid and diabetes mellitus [^736b9a9a]. Clinical Endocrinology (2011). Low credibility.

Thyroid disease and type 1 but also type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) are strongly associated, and this has important clinical implications for insulin sensitivity and treatment requirements. The pathophysiological basis of this association has only recently been better elucidated. It rests on a complex interaction of common signalling pathways and, in the case of type 1 diabetes and autoimmune thyroid disease, on a linked genetic susceptibility. The pathophysiological mechanisms underlying this linked regulation are increasingly being unravelled. They are exemplified in the regulation of 5' adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a central target not only for the modulation of insulin sensitivity but also for the feedback of thyroid hormones on appetite and energy expenditure. The present review will discuss these concepts and their consequences for the clinical care of patients with DM and thyroid disorders. Moreover, it makes reference to the added effect of metformin in suppressing TSH.

### Association of gestational thyroid function and thyroid autoimmunity with gestational diabetes: a systematic review and individual participant meta-analysis [^24c469c0]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2025). High credibility.

Background

Pregnancy is a state of increased metabolic demand that necessitates major changes in endocrine physiology. Gestational thyroid dysfunction and gestational diabetes are common endocrine conditions of pregnancy that frequently coincide. Although the effects of thyroid hormones on glucose metabolism are well documented, important knowledge gaps remain in terms of the extent and clinical relevance of these effects during pregnancy. The aim of this meta-analysis is to assess the association of thyroid function test results with gestational diabetes and markers of glucose metabolism.

Methods

In this systematic review and individual participant data meta-analysis, we searched Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Web of Science from database inception to Dec 12, 2024, for prospective population-based cohort studies with individual patient data on thyroid function, gestational diabetes, and measures of glucose homoeostasis during pregnancy. Furthermore, open invitations to join the Consortium on Thyroid and Pregnancy were issued to identify unpublished datasets. We excluded participants with multiple pregnancies; pre-existing thyroid disease or diabetes; current use of medications that could affect thyroid or glucose levels; or a history of infertility treatment, miscarriage, or stillbirth. Exposures were maternal gestational concentrations of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), free T 4 (FT 4), free T 3 (FT 3), and total T 3; thyroperoxidase antibody positivity; thyroglobulin antibody positivity; and thyroid disease entities (ie, subclinical hypothyroidism, overt and subclinical hyperthyroidism, and isolated hypothyroxinaemia), which were defined according to current guidelines. The primary outcome was presence of gestational diabetes as defined in individual cohorts. Individual participant data were analysed using generalised linear mixed-effects regression models adjusting for maternal age, BMI, smoking status, parity, ethnicity, fetal sex, and gestational age at blood sampling. We preregistered our study protocol with PROSPERO (CRD42022371927).

Findings

We identified 638 published studies with our systematic search, of which 21 studies based on 17 cohorts met inclusion criteria; 11 of these prospective cohort studies provided individual participant data, and data from an additional 14 cohorts were added via personal contacts and open invitations, resulting in a study population of 63548 participants from 25 cohorts after exclusions. Of the 52632 participants in 17 cohorts with TPOAb measurements available to define thyroid disease entities, 1687 (3·2%) of these participants had subclinical hypothyroidism, 1153 (2·2%) had isolated hypothyroxinaemia, and 2958 (4·7%) had gestational diabetes. Compared with euthyroidism, isolated hypothyroxinaemia was associated with a higher risk of gestational diabetes (absolute risk 6·5% [72 of 1113] for isolated hypothyroxinaemia vs 3·5% [1555 of 44787] for euthyroidism; adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1·52 [95% CI 1·17–1·98], p = 0·0017; 45900 participants). A lower FT 4 concentration was associated with a higher risk of gestational diabetes (non-linear, p < 0·0001). A higher risk of gestational diabetes was found both with a higher FT 3 concentration (aOR 1·18 [95%CI 1·10–1·28], p < 0·0001) and with a higher FT 3 -to-FT 4 ratio (non-linear; p < 0·0001). No evidence was found of associations of TSH, thyroid antibodies, or other thyroid function test abnormalities with gestational diabetes. I² statistics for the primary analyses ranged from 0–43%, indicating low to moderate heterogeneity. The funnel plot for overt hyperthyroidism indicated a possibility for publication bias (p = 0·049), but funnel plots for all other variables did not.

Interpretation

A lower FT 4 concentration and isolated hypothyroxinaemia during pregnancy are associated with a higher risk of gestational diabetes. Our results challenge the long-standing notion that subclinical hypothyroidism or thyroid autoimmunity are risk factors for gestational diabetes and support both the risk profile for gestational thyroid dysfunction and ongoing efforts on optimisation of treatment targets for pregnant people taking levothyroxine. Follow-up studies are required to establish to what extent levothyroxine initiation or dose adjustments can affect insulin resistance and antihyperglycaemic therapies during pregnancy.

### Association between thyroid dysfunction and type 2 diabetes: a meta-analysis of prospective observational studies [^35a2fe3c]. BMC Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Thyroid function levels and risk of T2DM

Meta-analysis of 12 studies demonstrated that a high baseline TSH level was associated with a 17% higher risk of T2DM (RR 1.17, 95% CI 1.01, 1.36; I² = 78%, P < 0.01) after a median of 6 years follow-up, when compared with a normal TSH (Fig. 2 A). A significant association of low serum FT3 concentrations (RR 1.40, 95% CI 1.09, 1.8; I² = 59%, P = 0.03) and low FT4 (RR 1.33, 95% CI 1.04, 1.71; I² = 62%, P = 0.02) with incidence of T2DM were also found (Figs. 3 B and 4 B). However, low TSH levels (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.80, 1.25; I² = 71%), high FT3 (RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.85, 1.60; I² = 0%), and high FT4 (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.97, 1.19; I² = 87%) were found to not be significantly related with T2DM risk (Figs. 2 B, 3 A, and 4 A). Additionally, as continuous variables, TSH (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.96, 1.09; I² = 61%), FT3 (RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.55, 2.44; I² = 65%), or FT4 (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.95, 1.10; I² = 88%) did not significantly correlate with the risk of T2DM (Figs. 2 C, 3 C, and 4 C). No substantial publication bias was detected for any of the above analyses using Begger's tests.

### Association between thyroid dysfunction and type 2 diabetes: a meta-analysis of prospective observational studies [^cc222be1]. BMC Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In summary, our meta-analysis demonstrated that thyroid dysfunction is associated with an increased risk of T2DM. There was no evidence that thyroid dysfunction was associated with CVD events and all-cause mortality in T2DM, though limited studies were available. Therefore, measuring TSH in patients with risk factors for diabetes may help further assess the risk for the development of T2DM.

### Thyroid dysfunction and type 2 diabetes mellitus: screening strategies and implications for management [^257d7864]. Diabetes Therapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

An increased prevalence of TD is being seen among patients with T2DM. In many studies, thyroid function tests have revealed that a substantial proportion of the new T2DM patients with TD have subclinical hypothyroidism. International guidelines vary widely and do not specifically suggest routine screening for this milder form of TD in T2DM patients. Coexistent T2DM and TD pose a higher cardiovascular disease risk. Insulin resistance links these conditions. TD can worsen T2DM and diabetes can worsen thyroid function. Antidiabetic drugs can alter thyroid function, and antithyroid drugs can alter glycaemic control. Considering the clinical implications of the coexistence of T2DM and TD, a more systematic approach to thyroid testing in T2DM is needed. Regular monitoring of glycaemic control in thyroid dysfunction is also suggested. More research is warranted to study the relationship between T2DM and TD.

### Correlation of serum thyrotropin and thyroid hormone levels with diabetic kidney disease: a cross-sectional study [^f3c15598]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a chronic metabolic disease affecting human health. The prevalence of DM in adults has reached 10.5% with 780 million people currently living with diabetes and is expected to increase to 46% by 2045. DM increases the risk of chronic complications. Diabetic kidney disease (DKD), one of the most common microvascular complications, has a prevalence rate of up to 25% in DM patients and is the main cause of chronic kidney disease and end-stage kidney disease, often imposing a large economic burden on patients and causing high morbidity and mortality.

Thyroid-related hormones are closely related to glucose metabolism, and both overt and subclinical thyroid dysfunction have adverse effects on disease control in DM patients, especially those with T2DM. The prevalence of diabetes in patients with thyroid dysfunction is higher than that in the normal population, and the prevalence of hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism in T2DM patients is higher than that in the normal population.

As a chronic complication of DM, the clinical diagnosis of DKD is mainly based on an increase in urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) and a decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Studies have found an independent correlation between subclinical hypothyroidism and the incidence of DKD in DM patients, and the serum thyrotropin (TSH) level is an independent risk factor for proteinuria. Serum FT3 levels in DKD patients with normal thyroid function were also significantly lower than those in non-nephrotic patients. However, relatively few studies have addressed the relationship between overall thyroid-related hormones and DKD; several studies found no correlation between the two. Therefore, we conducted a cross-sectional study to explore the correlation between DKD and thyroid-related hormones (TSH, FT3, and FT4) in T2DM patients to provide references for the monitoring and treatment of thyroid dysfunction in diabetes patients.

### Hypothyroidism: diagnosis and treatment… [^4bde2cf9]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

The hypothalamus adjusts the release of thyrotropin-releasing hormone based on circulating levels of thyroid hormone. Together, these hormones regulate the secretion of TSH from the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland. This functioning feedback loop keeps the blood level of the thyroid hormone normal. Diagnosis TSH elevation indicates hypothyroidism. Low-end normal TSH is 0. 4 mIU per L. |-| If the TSH level is low, hyperthyroidism is possible. 18 If the TSH level is high, a serum FT 4 level should be obtained. A low FT 4 level indicates clinical hypothyroidism, specifically autoimmune hypothyroidism if the TPO antibody test result is elevated). Table 1 lists other causes. 1–4 An elevated FT 4 level may suggest a TSH-secreting tumor, and referral to endocrinology is warranted. An FT 4 level within the reference range indicates subclinical hypothyroidism.

Rare other causes include adrenal insufficiency, drugs, post-nonthyroidal illness, or thyroid hormone resistance syndrome. 2 Thyroid hormone resistance syndrome, which occurs in one out of 40, 000 live births, results from mutations of the thyroid hormone receptor that cause decreased tissue responsiveness to thyroid hormone, leading to an elevated FT 4 level and a normal or elevated TSH level.
19. The TSH level should drop by 50% per week on adequate treatment. After clinical improvement, the patient may transition to oral levothyroxine monotherapy. 21, 25. 33 Patients with elevated TPO antibody titers are at an increased risk of progression to clinical hypothyroidism. 34 Annual progression from subclinical to clinical hypothyroidism is 5. 6% for a TSH level greater than 6 mIU per L.
34. Most adults older than 30 years with elevated TSH but normal FT 4 levels do not benefit from thyroid hormone therapy, and 60% normalize within five years.

37, 42 Patients who have a TSH level greater than 10 mIU per L are at higher risk of fracture, ischemic heart disease, and heart failure compared with patients who have a TSH level of 2. 0 to
2. 5 mIU per L.

### Different levels of thyroid hormones between impaired fasting glucose and impaired glucose tolerance: free T3 affects the prevalence of impaired fasting glucose and impaired glucose tolerance in opposite ways [^a57767ec]. Clinical Endocrinology (2014). Low credibility.

Context

There is an association between thyroid disorders and diabetes mellitus.

Objective

To investigate thyroid hormone levels in different glucose metabolic statuses, analyse relationships between thyroid hormone levels and different categories of prediabetes and metabolic parameters within a large euthyroid nondiabetic population.

Methods

A total of 3328 subjects without diabetes or thyroid dysfunction were included in this cross-sectional study. Subjects were divided in to four groups [normal glucose tolerance (NGR), impaired fasting glucose (IFG), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and combined glucose intolerance (CGI)] according to the results of oral glucose tolerance test. Participants were then divided into four groups according to the quartile of free T3 (FT3) in their blood.

Results

Subjects with IFG had higher levels of FT3 and ratio of FT3 to FT4 (FT3/FT4), but lower level of free T4 (FT4) than subjects with IGT. FT3/FT4 was negatively associated with postprandial plasma glucose (PPG) [standardized β (β) = -0·087; P < 0·001]. The prevalence of IFG and CGI was increased with the level of FT3, while the prevalence of IGT was decreased with the level of FT3 (P for trend: < 0·001, 0·003 and < 0·001, respectively). FT3 was negatively associated with the risk of IGT (OR = 0·409, 95% CI 0·179–0·935), whereas FT4 was positively associated with the risk of IGT (OR = 1·296, 95% CI 1·004–1·673).

Conclusions

Free thyroid hormone levels were different between subjects with IFG and IGT. FT3 affects the prevalence of IFG and IGT in opposite ways. The difference in thyroid hormone levels may play an important role in the different pathological mechanisms of IFG and IGT.

### Association between thyroid hormones and the components of metabolic syndrome [^ff054c0c]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Thyroid hormones are known to have direct and indirect effects on metabolism. Individuals with metabolic syndrome, a disease that is growing in incidence at a rapid rate, are at higher risk for cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer. The aim of this study was to identify whether significant correlations exist between thyroid hormone levels and components of the metabolic syndrome in the general population of Korea.

Methods

The data were collected from the sixth Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys from 2013 to 2015. A total of 1423 participants were tested for thyroid function. The analysis of variance and multiple linear regression were performed to analyze the relationship between thyroid hormone level and components of the metabolic syndrome.

Results

A positive association between free thyroxine and fasting glucose level was observed in patients with high free thyroxine levels (≥ 1.70 ng/dL, β = 15.992, p = < 0.0001), when compared with patients with normal-middle free thyroxine levels. Moreover, a negative association was observed between free thyroxine and triglyceride levels in patients with normal-high free thyroxine levels (β = -21.145, p = 0.0054) and those with high free thyroxine levels (β = -49.713, p = 0.0404).

Conclusion

Free thyroxine shows a partially positive association with fasting glucose and a partially negative association with triglycerides in the Korean population. In patients with abnormal thyroid function, follow up tests for glucose levels and lipid profiling during treatment for thyroid dysfunction would be beneficial in terms of overlooking metabolic syndrome and to prevent related diseases.

### Association between thyroid hormone parameters and dyslipidemia among type 2 diabetes mellitus patients: comparative cross-sectional study [^451c5058]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The relationship between thyroid function and lipid profile has been documented in T2DM and healthy subjects. The aim of the current study was to assess the association between thyroid hormone parameters and dyslipidemia in T2DM and non-diabetic study participants.

Method and Materials

In this comparative cross-sectional study, 214 type 2 diabetic and 214 non-diabetic study participants were enrolled. Clinical and anthropometric data were collected from all study participants. After overnight fasting, 10ml of whole blood samples were drawn for the measurement of serum TSH, free thyroxine (fT4), free triiodothyronine (fT3), serum reactive C-protein levels, as well as for lipid profile test and glucose.

Result

The burden of hypothyroidism and subclinical hypothyroidism among T2DM study participants were 73 (17.05%) and 13 (3.04%) respectively. Comparatively, T2DM study participants had significantly higher serum lipid level than non-diabetics. Stratified by TSH, hypothyroid T2DM study participants had increased lipid level than euthyroid subjects. T2DM serum TSH have shown a positive significant correlation with all lipid profile parameters except HDL-C. In the final model (multivariate linear regression), diabetics serum TSH significantly and positively associated with TG and BMI. Diabetic serum fT3 and fT4 negatively associated with body mass index. In addition, diabetics serum fT3 negatively and serum fT4 positively associated with TC and HDL-C respectively.

Conclusion

T2DM study subjects had significantly higher lipid level than nondiabetic and We identified that TSH was positively associated with serum TG and BMI among T2DM study participants.

### Correlation of serum thyrotropin and thyroid hormone levels with diabetic kidney disease: a cross-sectional study [^a1f23064]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Mechanistically, thyroid hormones and DKD can influence each other. Firstly, diabetes affects thyroid function. Hyperglycemia-induced inflammation can inhibit 5'-deiodinase activity to reduce peripheral T4 to T3 deiodination, FT3 decreased, affecting the hypothalamic–pituitary–thyroid axis. In the context of metabolic disorders and with the development of DKD, damage to glomerular structures can cause protein loss, which further reduces FT3, leading to hypothyroidism. And the kidney, as an important organ for iodine metabolism, can experience iodine accumulation, elevated thyroxine, and negative feedback to elevated TSH levels in pathological conditions, which also affects thyroid function. Secondly, thyroid dysfunction can also affect kidney function. Elevated TSH levels can cause increased peripheral vascular resistance, decreased cardiac output and eGFR. Low FT3 levels can consequently aggravate impaired tubular concentrating and diluting functions, reduce renal plasma flow and glomerular transcapillary hydrostatic pressure, and deteriorate renal function. As mentioned above, the more severe the development of DKD, the lower the FT3 level will be and the more it will affect the thyroid function, and the thyroid dysfunction in turn will aggravate the development of DKD, and both of these interactions will contribute to the development of the disease on both sides.

### Genetically determined higher TSH is associated with a lower risk of diabetes mellitus in individuals with low BMI [^0fa61967]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

The findings of the present study add to previous research regarding the role of low thyroid status and DM onset. Several observational studies in humans observed an association of higher TSH level with a higher risk of DM. However, not all observational studies showed an association between higher TSH and DM. De Vries and colleagues and Ittermann et al did not observe a relation between plasma TSH levels within the normal range and incident DM. The lack of a causal association with TSH and fT4 as observed in the overall study population of the present study may suggest that previously observed associations of alterations in thyroid status and DM onset might have resulted from reverse causality and/or residual confounding. One of the potential interfering mechanisms could be reduced central sensitivity to thyroid hormones commonly seen coinciding with metabolic syndrome. In addition, many other factors such as autoimmune disorders could cause residual confounding. Furthermore, these findings confirm our previous observations of no association between circulating TSH and fT4 and risk of DM at population level using 2-sample MR analyses with fewer instruments in a smaller study population.

### Association of thyroid hormone with body fat content and lipid metabolism in euthyroid male patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: a cross-sectional study [^0b672b7b]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a prominent global public health problem, accounting for approximately 415 million cases globally, and the prevalence of T2DM is predicted to increase to 642 million in 2040. T2DM could induce excessive risks of cardiovascular disease, neuropathy, nephropathy, retinopathy, and microvascular complications. Moreover, the economic burden of diabetes globally was $1.31 trillion and accounted for approximately 1.8% of the global gross domestic product. Studies showed that insulin resistance was common in T2DM and metabolic syndrome. Insulin resistance was a risk factor for stroke and end-stage renal disease. Obesity is the basis of insulin resistance because of the harmful effects of excess fat accumulation on glucose metabolism, which causes functional impairments in metabolic pathways of several areas such as adipose tissue and peripheral organs, like the liver, heart, pancreas, and muscles.

Thyroid hormones, including thyroxine and triiodothyronine, regulate the synthesis, mobilization, and breakdown of lipids. Thyroid hormones are closely related to obesity, and slight changes in serum thyroid hormone level can cause local fat accumulation and increased body mass. The thyrotropin receptor (TSHR) has long been considered as a key regulator of thyroid function. Recent studies have shown that thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) can also bind directly to TSHR in tissues outside the thyroid to exert external effects, such as in the adipose tissue and liver. The role of thyroid function in energy metabolism has been extensively studied, but traditional viewpoints only emphasize the role of hypothyroidism or subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) in obesity. Among patients with obesity but with normal thyroid function, thyroid hormones, especially TSH, are significantly different from that of people of healthy weight. This manifests as higher TSH, free triiodothyronine (T3), and free thyroxine (T4) levels in obese patients than those in healthy people. The incidence of thyroid diseases in patients with T2DM is significantly increased, especially SCH, and is more common in women than men. However, the relationship among TSH, FT3, FT4, body fat content, and lipid metabolism in T2DM patients with normal thyroid function has not been reported. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to explore the association of thyroid hormone levels with body fat content and lipid metabolism in euthyroid male patients with T2DM.

### Free triiodothyronine predicts the risk of developing diabetic kidney disease [^e33cbe10]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Diabetes mellitus is the largest disease in the endocrine field today and is widely prevalent worldwide. Long-term hyperglycemia can involve various organ systems, leading to various tissue, vascular and neurological dysfunctions, among which renal damage is the most common. In recent years, it has been found that the renal damage caused by diabetes is not only limited to the glomerulu, but also the renal tubule play a key role in the early and progressive stages of DKD, and are an important "driver" for the development of DKD. In other words, glomerular and tubule damage is closely related to DKD.

The thyroid, as the largest endocrine gland in the body, is essential for the regulation of energy homeostasis and metabolic rate. It has been shown that the thyroid interacts with the kidney. Thyroid hormone (TH) can directly affect renal growth and development, glomerular filtration rate, renal hemodynamics, and sodium and water homeostasis; the kidney is likewise involved in TH physiology, not only as an organ of TH metabolism and elimination, but also as a target organ for certain effects of iodothyronine. Previous studies have shown a close relationship between thyroid hormones and DKD, Diabetic patients with high thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels and low FT3 levels are more likely to develop DKD, and Subclinical hypothyroidism has been shown to be an independent risk factor for DKD progression.

The aim of this study was to further evaluate the relationship between changes in FT3 levels and renal damage in type 2 diabetic patients based on glomerular and tubular markers.

### Thyroid dysfunction and type 2 diabetes mellitus: screening strategies and implications for management [^2765142b]. Diabetes Therapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Diabetes mellitus (DM) and thyroid dysfunction (TD) often tend to coexist in patients. Both hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism are more common in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients than in their nondiabetic counterparts. Current guidelines are neither clear nor specific about the frequency of thyroid function monitoring in T2DM patients. Circulating thyroid hormones affect several different organs and cells, have a major impact on glucose, lipid, and protein metabolism, and can worsen glycaemic control in T2DM. Hyperthyroidism and thyrotoxicosis can worsen subclinical DM and cause hyperglycaemia in T2DM patients, increasing the risk of diabetic complications. T2DM reduces thyroid-stimulating hormone levels and impairs the conversion of thyroxine (T4) to triiodothyronine (T3) in the peripheral tissues. Poorly managed T2DM can lead to insulin resistance and hyperinsulinaemia, which causes thyroid tissue proliferation and increases nodule formation and goitre size. In addition, while metformin can be beneficial in both T2DM and TD patients, other antidiabetics such as sulfonylureas, pioglitazone, and thiazolidinediones can negatively impact TD. Antithyroid drugs such as methimazole can impair glycaemic control in T2DM patients. Thyrovigilance in T2DM patients and diabetovigilance in TD patients may therefore be necessary to facilitate individualized care and management. Funding: Abbott India Ltd.

### Prevalence of thyroid dysfunction in patients with diabetes mellitus [^32ee55d1]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Diabetes Mellitus (DM) and thyroid dysfunction (TD) are the two most common endocrine disorders in clinical practice. The association between DM and TD is widely known, with the first studies published in 1979. Since then, several studies in different countries were conducted to estimate the prevalence of TD in diabetic patients. There is great variability in the prevalence of TD in general population, ranging from 6.6% to 13.4%. In diabetic patients, the prevalence is still greater and varies from 10 to 24%. These differences can be explained by different diagnostic criteria of TD, the degree of iodine intake among different regions, different sensitivities of the TSH assays and the large population diversity. The relationship between TD and DM is characterized by a complex interaction of interdependence. Screening of TD, especially the subclinical dysfunction, in patients with DM is justified because most patients can be asymptomatic. Determine the prevalence of clinical and subclinical thyroid disease in diabetic patients in our country and its implications in the course of diabetes and known factors for cardiovascular risk is necessary. The aim of this study is to investigate the prevalence of TD in patients with type 1 (T1DM) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in clinical routine.

### Association between maternal thyroid function in early pregnancy and gestational diabetes: a prospective cohort study [^7783ad2a]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a common endocrine disease that occurs during pregnancy and results in glucose intolerance. The proportion of pregnant women with GDM has continued to rise in recent decades, resulting in a substantial impact on public health. GDM raises the danger of perinatal maternal diseases and poor pregnancy outcomes such as hypertension related to pregnancy, preterm labor injury, preeclampsia, newborn respiratory distress syndrome, and cardiac hypertrophy in infants. Additionally, an increase in the lifetime danger of maternal type 2 diabetes has been linked to a diagnosis of GDM.

Thyroid function and metabolism of thyroid hormones undergo significant changes during pregnancy. Placental human chorionic gonadotropin is structurally similar to thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and stimulates the thyroid gland directly through TSH receptors, so TSH secretion is briefly suppressed in the first trimester, while serum free thyroxine (FT4) and free triiodothyronine concentrations are elevated in the first trimester. The thyroid gland's hormones are essential regulators of metabolic systems such as glucose, protein, and lipid metabolism, and type 2 diabetes in adults and thyroid disorders have been reported to be related. Hypothyroidism in adults is associated with resistance to insulin, altered glucose metabolism, and being overweight, which each possibly contribute to the development of diabetes type 2. Although the association between GDM and thyroid diseases and thyroid markers during pregnancy has been widely studied, findings are not consistent, and the specific mechanisms of the associations remain unclear. Several studies have found correlations between thyroid disease during pregnancy and GDM. For instance, Fatima et al discovered significant positive connections between TSH and glucose levels during pregnancy and suggested that subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) may affect glucose metabolism in pregnant women with diabetes. GDM risks are also raised by low early-gestational hormone levels of the thyroid. Li et al reported that thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPOAb) positivity increased the occurrence of GDM, and a meta-analysis of 10 cohorts of research indicated that when TSH > 4.0 mIU/L, GDM incidence increased independent of thyroid antibody status, whereas GDM incidence depended on thyroid antibody status for TSH < 4.0 mIU/L. Another meta-analysis by Luo et al found that thyroid function impairment and thyroid antibody positivity were linked to the incidence of GDM. However, the results of other studies do not support these correlations.

Subgroup and sensitivity analyses

Due to the limited number of studies included, subgroup analyses on the TSH-T2DM association stratified by age (age < 60 years and ≥ 60 years), sex (women ≥ 50% and women < 50%), study location (Asia and Europe/USA), BMI (normal and overweight/obese), follow-up years (≤ 5 years and > 5 years), thyroid medication users (no, mixed, and not reported), sample size (≤ median and > median), and quality score (6, 7, and 8 stars) were applied. A significant association between high levels of TSH and T2DM was found among studies of participants with normal weight and follow-up years longer than 5 years, but not in those who were overweight or obese or with follow-up years less or equal to 5 years (all P values for interaction < 0.05) (Table 2). Additionally, studies which did not report the information on thyroid medication use tended to have a significant association between low levels of TSH and high risk of T2DM, but not in those including both users and non-users (P value for interaction = 0.007).

### The role of thyroid hormone in metabolism and metabolic syndrome [^67149820]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

As previously reported, obesity is commonly associated with high serum TSH level and with increment of deiodinases' activities, converting T4 to T3. Thus, this hormonal profile (high TSH and FT3 levels and low serum FT4, even in its respective reference ranges) might be associated with MetS via mechanisms previously described that mediate the interaction between thyroid function and clinical components of metabolic syndrome.

As demonstrated in Table 2, glycemia or glycosylated hemoglobin might be positively, or negatively, associated with serum TSH levels. A positive association between TSH levels (or reduced thyroid function) and abnormal glucose metabolism may be related to the importance of the action of TH in different pathways related to glucose transport, especially those related to the expression of GLUT 4, as previously described. This hypothesis is supported by longitudinal studies that found a higher risk for diabetes mellitus (DM) development in patients with low thyroid function or higher levels of serum TSH.

In fact, a positive association between fasting plasmatic insulin or HOMA-IR index and TSH levels has been described in some cross-sectional studies, which was confirmed in a cohort analysis of 5998 subjects. However, the increase in serum TSH levels may be an effect of weight gain based on several previously described mechanisms. Consequently, it may be solely a biomarker for MetS and not necessarily a causative effect of the studied endpoints related to MetS. Since patients diagnosed with MetS concomitant with IR may demonstrate lower levels of serum FT4 due to conversion of FT4 to T3, the absence of a correlation between glycemia or HOMA-IR and FT4 has been observed in a large number of studies, especially those examining euthyroid subjects (Table 2).

The adverse effects of glucose metabolism are not only associated with the reduction of thyroid function or higher serum TSH levels in humans, but the adverse effects are also associated with higher serum TH levels. Longitudinal studies found a higher risk for DM development correlated with higher levels of serum FT4. In fact, overt and subclinical (SC) hyperthyroidism were associated with fasting glycemia or abnormal glucose metabolism in different studies. However, the association between serum FT4 levels in the upper reference range and serum glucose was not consistently observed in all human studies (Table 2). Finally, a cohort analysis involving 38,200 individuals revealed a higher risk for DM development in patients with either hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. It seems reasonable to attribute a U-shaped pattern of risk to THs and glucose metabolism abnormalities.

### Association between thyroid dysfunction and diabetic retinopathy: a two-sample bidirectional mendelian randomization study [^c16b41c2]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a common complication of diabetes and considered the most serious microvascular complication. Its prevalence increases with the duration of diabetes. Reports indicate that DR is the most common complication among individuals aged 20–65 years and is the leading cause of vision loss in adults. The condition is attributed to chronic hyperglycemia resulting from abnormal glucose metabolism due to prolonged exposure of the retina to high glucose levels during diabetes. The main pathological features include retinal inflammation, vascular leakage, and neovascularization. Current treatment options for DR involve anti-vascular endothelial growth factor drugs, retinal laser photocoagulation, and vitrectomy; however, these treatments have not shown significant clinical improvement in patients' vision.

The main forms of thyroid dysfunction are hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism. Clinically, thyroid hormones, including serum free triiodothyronine (FT3), free thyroxine (FT4), and serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), are measured to assess thyroid function. While research on the relationship between thyroid function and diabetic microvascular complications deepens, the association between thyroid function and diabetic retinopathy (DR) remains unclear. Some studies suggest that thyroid hormones (TH) can be an independent risk factor for diabetic retinopathy, aiding in predicting its development and guiding clinical management. However, in a cross-sectional survey study found no significant relationship between TH levels and the development of DR in contrast to its apparent opposite findings. Similarly, conflicting findings exist, as demonstrated in various clinical observational studies across different populations. For instance, a cross-sectional survey in southern India revealed a higher prevalence of thyroid dysfunction, particularly subclinical hypothyroidism, among patients with type 2 diabetes, which was linked to an increased risk of diabetic retinopathy. Conversely, a clinical retrospective trial in the Caucasus found no significant relationship between TSH levels or subclinical hypothyroidism and diabetic retinopathy. These discrepancies in findings may be influenced by sample size or confounding variables, highlighting the need for larger multi-center randomized controlled trials to validate these results. It is important to note that conducting RCT research poses challenges such as resource constraints, time limitations, and ethical considerations.

### Thyroid dysfunction and type 2 diabetes mellitus: screening strategies and implications for management [^b22f7658]. Diabetes Therapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Clinical Guidelines on Screening for Thyroid Disorders in Diabetes

It is important to screen for TD in T2DM patients as each of these endocrinopathies and their complex interdependent interactions increase cardiovascular risks. However, some guidelines do not mention anything about monitoring thyroid function in T2DM, while others recommend a thyroid function test at baseline but are against routine annual thyroid screening in T2DM (Table 1).

Table 1
Major recommendations for thyroid screening in diabetes mellitus patients

T1DM type 1 diabetes mellitus, T2DM type 2 diabetes mellitus, GDM gestational diabetes, TD thyroid disorders, TSH thyroid-stimulating hormone, anti-TPO anti-thyroid peroxidase antibody, anti-TG antithyroglobulin antibody, FT4 free thyroxine, TFT thyroid function test, NICE National Institute for Clinical Excellence, SCH subclinical hypothyroidism, OGTT oral glucose tolerance test

In its guidance for 2000, the American Thyroid Association recommended that adults who were at least 35 years old should be screened for thyroid disorders by measuring serum thyrotropin every 5 years irrespective of whether they were diabetic or nondiabetic. However, the 2015 Thyroid Dysfunction: Screening Guidelines of the US Preventive Services Task Force conclude that there is insufficient evidence to recommend TD screening in nonpregnant or asymptomatic adults.

The recommendations for thyroid function screening of T2DM patients are not clear. The increasing evidence supporting a link between T2DM and TD, however, suggests that screening may need to be considered.

### Relationship between serum thyrotropin concentrations and metformin therapy in euthyroid patients with type 2 diabetes [^ef032a7e]. Clinical Endocrinology (2013). Low credibility.

Aim

A thyrotropin(TSH)-lowering effect of metformin therapy has been recently reported in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and hypothyroidism. We aimed to evaluate the interplay between metformin therapy and serum TSH concentrations in a group of patients with T2D and normal thyroid function.

Patients and Methods

Eight hundred and twenty-eight euthyroid patients with T2D (53% women, mean age 65·9 years, median duration of diabetes 10 years) were retrospectively evaluated. There were 250 patients on metformin treatment (30·2%). Serum concentrations of TSH were measured in all subjects.

Results

Patients on metformin treatment exhibited significantly higher TSH levels [1·63 (1·11–2·24) mU/l] than those found in patients without metformin [1·40 (1·01–2·24) mU/l, P = 0·009]. We found no significant differences in TSH levels in patients who were on therapy with other oral antidiabetics, antihypertensive drugs or hypolipidemic agents in relation to subjects not taking these drugs. Serum TSH was significantly related to gender, body mass index, hyperlipidaemia and the presence of goitre and diabetic macroangiopathy. In multiple regression analysis with TSH as dependent variable, goitre was negatively related to TSH values. Metformin therapy was a nonsignificant variable in this model.

Conclusion

In summary, this is the first survey analysing the relationship between metformin and thyroid function in a large cohort of patients with diabetes. Our data do not support the presence of an independent and significant relationship between TSH values and metformin treatment in euthyroid patients with T2D.

### Correlation of serum thyrotropin and thyroid hormone levels with diabetic kidney disease: a cross-sectional study [^56fd3153]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this cross-sectional study, we analyzed the relationship between thyroid-related hormones and DKD and found that the UACR correlated positively with TSH and negatively with FT3, whereas the eGFR correlated negatively with TSH and positively with FT3. This trend was especially apparent in normal or reduced FT levels and in normal or increased TSH levels.

DM and its complications involve complex interactions with the thyroid gland. Hyperinsulinemia and high leptin levels, which are common in T2DM patients, can stimulate the synthesis of TSH, whereas excessive or reduced thyroid-related hormones can exacerbate glucose metabolism disorders. The prevalence of thyroid function disorders in T2DM patients is reportedly higher than that in the normal population, and DKD, a major complication of DM, is also closely related to thyroid dysfunction. Our study also confirmed that T2DM patients with thyroid dysfunction have a higher prevalence of abnormal renal function than that in the normal population. Our study showed a greater probability of abnormal renal function in T2DM patients with higher TSH levels than in those with lower TSH levels. This is consistent with the results reported by Han et al. This study, which included 61 meta-studies, concluded that the prevalence of subclinical hypothyroidism was higher in T2DM patients, and that subclinical hypothyroidism increased the prevalence of diabetic nephropathy (odds ratio [OR] 1.74, 95% CI: 1.34–2.28). In addition, similar results were found in clinical studies, where two cross-sections of 414 T2DM patients with no prior history of thyroid disease and 8418 normoglycemic individuals found that higher UACR ratios were positively associated with subclinical hypothyroidism (OR, 3.51, 95% CI: 1.10–10.0), and increased TSH was negatively correlates with eGFR independently of age, body mass index, and glucose. A Japanese longitudinal study that included 7609 health-screened members of the general population showed that those with above-normal TSH levels had a significantly higher risk of developing chronic kidney disease within 3 years than the risk in those with below-normal TSH levels (OR 1.58, 95% CI: 1.02–2.45).

### Correlation between the thyroid hormone levels and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in type 2 diabetic patients with normal thyroid function [^4b8c2641]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). Medium credibility.

However, it should be pointed out that these clinical research subjects from above previous studies were all non-diabetic subjects. Currently, it has been clarified that diabetic patients are often accompanied by abnormal level of thyroid hormones. Higher incidence of NAFLD has been confirmed in T2DM patients and lower screening threshold has been proposed for clinicians. Bril et al. demonstrated that low levels of FT4 increased triglyceride levels in T2DM patients followed the increasing risk of NAFLD by taking a study on 232 patients with normal thyroid function in T2DM, which was consistent with the present result that an obvious increase trend of NAFLD incidence was accompanied by the declining of FT4 levels. Zhu et al. used the MatchIt function in the R language package to study 184 T2DM patients using 1:1 covariation matching. Here, the level of FT3, TT3 and FT3/FT4 ratio in the NAFLD group was higher than the non-NAFLD group. After correcting the mixed factors such as diabetes course, BMI, systolic pressure, TG, HDL and LDL, the result found that the serum FT3 levels had a positive relationship with NAFLD's risk. Meanwhile, the results of NAFLD showed a significant upward trend with the levels of FT3 and FT3/FT4 ratio increasing, which were consistent with our result in the present study. And in our research, when NFS < 0.676, significant differences in age, FT4 and FT3/FT4 ratio were found among T2DM patients with and without NAFLD group. These results are consistent with the results of previous study by Van den berg, suggesting that abnormal thyroid hormone level is one valuable indicator worthy of emphasis for diagnosis of T2DM. The mechanism for the phenomenon may be that metabolic disorder induced by abnormal thyroid hormone functions further increases the cellular resistance to insulin.

### Thyroid dysfunction prevalence and relation to glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^1f937dd5]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

It is usually difficult to clinically identify thyroid abnormalities in diabetics as features of thyroid dysfunction may simulate diabetes symptoms or complications. So, assessing thyroid dysfunction prevalence in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) would help better control of DM and its complications. Several studies reported this prevalence, however, some included small sample size or lacked a control group. We aimed to determine thyroid dysfunction prevalence in diabetic patients as well as its relation to glycemic control.

Methods

A cross-sectional study included 200 patients having type 2 DM and 200 apparently healthy controls. Each participant was tested for fasting and 2-h post-prandial blood glucose, glycated haemoglobin (HbA1C), thyroid function tests: thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), free tri-iodothyronine (FT3), free thyroxine (FT4), serum total cholesterol and triglycerides and thyroid antibodies; anti-thyroid peroxidase (anti-TPO) and anti-thyroglobulin (anti-Tg) for hypothyroidism only.

Results

There was a significant increase in serum TSH and T3 levels in diabetics when compared with the controls, (P < 0.001, P = 0.001), respectively. Thyroid dysfunction was significantly more prevalent in patients with HbA1c ≥ 8%, (P = 0.0001), and in those having longer diabetes duration, (P < 0.001).

Conclusion

There was a higher prevalence of thyroid dysfunction among patients with type 2 DM. This dysfunction increased with the rise of HbA1c. This could suggest that poor glycemic control may have a role in the development of thyroid dysfunction in type 2 DM patients. Subclinical hypothyroidism was the most prevalent type of thyroid dysfunction in diabetic patients.

### Correlation between the thyroid hormone levels and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in type 2 diabetic patients with normal thyroid function [^0e8c601f]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In summary, the present study indicated that there is closely correlation between the abnormal thyroid hormone levels and liver fibrosis in T2DM patients, i.e. the prevalence of NAFLD increased following the increase of FT3, FT3/FT4 ratio and decrease of FT4. These results suggested that the change of thyroid hormone level in T2DM patients should be tested routinely for judging the patient's condition and predicting the prognosis.

### Association between decreased thyroid stimulating hormone and hyperuricemia in type 2 diabetic patients with early-stage diabetic kidney disease [^7e1c6037]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Serum uric acid (SUA) is associated with the development of diabetic kidney disease (DKD). Thyroid hormones can regulate metabolism and insulin resistance. The relationship between SUA and thyroid function in patients with DKD is still uncertain. In current study, we aimed to investigate the association between thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and SUA in type 2 diabetic patients with early-stage DKD.

Methods

Two hundred fifty-four type 2 diabetic patients with early-stage DKD were enrolled in current study and were further classified as high SUA group (SUA level > 420 μmol/L in males or > 360 μmol/L in females, n = 101) and normal SUA group (SUA level ≤ 420 μmol/L in males or ≤ 360 μmol/L in females, n = 153). Eighty-five control subjects were recruited as control group. The clinical characteristics were obtained via face-to-face surveys and medical records.

Results

Compared with normal SUA group and control group, high SUA group exhibited the increased SUA level, and the decreased TSH level (P < 0.017 for all), and no significant difference was detected in SUA and TSH between normal SUA group and control group. TSH was negatively associated with SUA (r = − 0.35, P < 0.001) in type 2 diabetic participants with early-stage DKD. Furthermore, the decreased TSH level was independently correlated with higher SUA level (β = − 25.69, P < 0.001), and retained a significant association with hyperuricemia (odds ratio = 1.73, P = 0.002) after adjusting for confounding factors in type 2 diabetic patients with early-stage DKD.

Conclusions

TSH is negatively correlated with SUA, and decreased TSH is an independent risk factor for hyperuricemia in type 2 diabetic patients with early-stage DKD. These results indicate that thyroid hormones, TSH in particular, might participate in regulating uric acid metabolism in patients with early-stage DKD.

### Associations between thyroid function and gestational diabetes mellitus in Chinese pregnant women: a retrospective cohort study [^32afc283]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a major complication that may occur during pregnancy and greatly affects the health of mothers and infants. Mothers with GDM have a higher risk of adverse birth outcomes, and may be imposed to a seven-fold increased risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in later life. The prevalence of GDM has progressively increased in China, and now occurs at a rate of 14.8% according to a recent report. More studies are urgently needed to better understand the potential pathogenesis and risk factors for GDM and thus identify possible control measures.

Thyroid hormones are important for maintaining the current and long-term health of all humans, including that of mothers and children. Several indicators are commonly used to measure thyroid function, namely the concentrations of free thyroxine (FT4), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), and anti-thyroperoxidase antibody (TPO Ab). A person's thyroid status (e.g. euthyroidism; subclinical hypothyroidism, SCH; isolated hypothyroxinemia; or hyperthyroidism) can be determined according to their relative concentrations of FT4 and TSH.

### Correlation between the thyroid hormone levels and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in type 2 diabetic patients with normal thyroid function [^d8e8da68]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). Medium credibility.

Correlation of thyroid hormone levels with liver fibrosis and NAFLD in T2DM patients

The level of FT3, FT4, TT3 and FT3/FT4 ratio was specified as independent variables with different regression models, respectively, and regression models 1, 2 and 3 were constructed, regardless of whether NAFLD was a dependent variable or not. Model 1 did not correct any factors, according to the results (Table 4), suggested that the relationship between FT3, TT3 and FT3/FT4 ratio and NAFLD (p = 0.022, p = 0.043, p = 0.000) was considered to be positive, but the correlation between FT4 level and NAFLD was in contrary (p = 0.007). Model 2 corrected the gender factor and claimed that FT3, FT3/FT4 ratio were positively correlated with NAFLD (p = 0.034, p = 0.000). Meanwhile, a negative relationship could be found between the FT4 level and NAFLD (p = 0.006). TT3 level was not a favorable correlation with NAFLD (p = 0.055). Model 3 corrected for gender, age, DBP, waistline, diabetes course, BMI, TG, HDL, APO-A1 and APO-B factors. Based on the research results, it was easy to find that FT3/FT4 ratio was positively connected to NAFLD (p = 0.038), while FT4 level was negatively related to NAFLD (p = 0.026).

### Variation in normal range thyroid function affects serum cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and type 2 diabetes risk: a mendelian randomization study [^821e7084]. Thyroid (2021). Medium credibility.

Background: Observational studies have demonstrated that variation in normal range thyroid function is associated with major cardiovascular risk factors, including dyslipidemia, hypertension, type 2 diabetes (T2D), and obesity. As observational studies are prone to residual confounding, reverse causality, and selection bias, we used a Mendelian randomization (MR) approach to investigate whether these associations are causal or not. Methods: Two-sample MR analysis using data from the largest available genome-wide association studies on normal range thyrotropin (TSH) and free thyroxine (fT4) levels, serum lipid levels, blood pressure measurements, T2D, and obesity traits (body mass index [BMI] and waist/hip ratio). Results: A one standard deviation (SD) increase in genetically predicted TSH levels was associated with a 0.037 SD increase in total cholesterol levels (p = 3.0×10–4). After excluding pleiotropic instruments, we also observed significant associations between TSH levels and low-density lipoprotein levels (β = 0.026 SD, p = 1.9×10–3), pulse pressure (β = -0.477mmHg, p = 7.5×10–10), and T2D risk (odds ratio = 0.95, p = 2.5×10–3). While we found no evidence of causal associations between TSH or fT4 levels and obesity traits, we found that a one SD increase in genetically predicted BMI was associated with a 0.075 SD decrease in fT4 levels (p = 3.6×10–4). Conclusions: Variation in normal range thyroid function affects serum cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and T2D risk.

### Association between decreased thyroid stimulating hormone and hyperuricemia in type 2 diabetic patients with early-stage diabetic kidney disease [^9534cef6]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2021). Medium credibility.

To the best of our knowledge, studies of the relationship between SUA and thyroid hormones in patients with DKD have been few in number, with incomplete information regarding the underlying interaction, although there have been some researches with controversial results to explore this association in different populations. Additionally, there is collinearity among thyroxine, triiodothyronine and TSH, and TSH is the most sensitive and the earliest changing index in thyroid hormones. Therefore, in present study, we aimed to investigate the possible association between TSH and SUA in type 2 diabetic patients with early-stage DKD.

### Thyroid hormone levels correlate with the maturation of implanted pancreatic endoderm cells in patients with type 1 diabetes [^496e0209]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Macroencapsulated pancreatic endoderm cells (PECs) can reverse diabetes in rodents and preclinical studies revealed that thyroid hormones in vitro and in vivo bias PECs to differentiate into insulin-producing cells. In an ongoing clinical trial, PECs implanted in macroencapsulation devices into patients with type 1 diabetes were safe but yielded heterogeneous outcomes. Though most patients developed meal responsive C-peptide, levels were heterogeneous and explanted grafts had variable numbers of surviving cells with variable distribution of endocrine cells.

Methods

We measured circulating triiodothyronine and thyroxine levels in all patients treated at 1 of the 7 sites of the ongoing clinical trial and determined if thyroid hormone levels were associated with the C-peptide or glucagon levels and cell fate of implanted PECs.

Results

Both triiodothyronine and thyroxine levels were significantly associated with the proportion of cells that adopted an insulin-producing fate with a mature phenotype. Thyroid hormone levels were inversely correlated to circulating glucagon levels after implantation, suggesting that thyroid hormones lead PECs to favor an insulin-producing fate over a glucagon-producing fate. In mice, hyperthyroidism led to more rapid maturation of PECs into insulin-producing cells similar in phenotype to PECs in euthyroid mice.

Conclusion

These data highlight the relevance of thyroid hormones in the context of PEC therapy in patients with type 1 diabetes and suggest that a thyroid hormone adjuvant therapy may optimize cell outcomes in some PEC recipients.

### Effects of thyroid hormone on A1c and glycated albumin levels in nondiabetic subjects with overt hypothyroidism [^ebab17ee]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

A1C is widely used for assessment of glycemic control, and the American Diabetes Association (ADA) recently recommended its use for diagnosing diabetes and pre-diabetes. Serum glycated albumin (GA) has been introduced as a marker of short-term glycemia. However, A1C or GA is subject to certain limitations. Conditions that affect erythrocyte turnover or survival lead to falsely high or low A1C levels. GA levels might be influenced by serum albumin metabolism.

Thyroid hormone stimulates erythrocyte production, and hypothyroidism often results in hypoproliferative erythropoiesis. In addition, thyroid hormone promotes albumin metabolism, and albumin degradation is reduced in hypothyroidism. We therefore hypothesized that A1C or GA levels do not accurately reflect glycemia in hypothyroidism. Thus, we aimed to determine the effects of thyroid hormone on A1C and GA levels in nondiabetic patients with overt hypothyroidism.

### Relationship between thyroid feedback quantile-based index and cardiovascular diseases in a population with normal thyroid function: evidence from the national health and nutrition examination survey 2007–2012 [^e17e66f9]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

This investigation examined the association between a central thyroid hormone sensitivity index, TFQI, and the prevalence of CVD based on the NHANES 2007–2008, 2009–2010, and 2011–2012 data. Our results demonstrated a strong correlation between TFQI and the incidence of CVD. The greater TFQI levels were linked with raised CVD occurrence. The strongest association between TFQI and the prevalence of CVD was seen in the subgroup analyses that were stratified by gender and BMI. Specifically, this link was most prominent in the female subgroup and among those with a BMI of more than 28 kg/m².

Over the years, significant attention has been given to the effect of hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism on CVD. However, recent research has suggested that even in individuals with normal function of the thyroid, higher levels of thyroid hormone resistance index are associated with an increased incidence and adverse prognosis of CVD. Furthermore, there is a greater incidence of diabetes, obesity, and metabolic syndrome in individuals with elevated thyroid hormone resistance index. Our study aligns with these prior findings, as we found a positive connection between TFQI and the incidence of CVD and a strong association with diabetes. The primary pathological mechanism underlying the development of CVD is atherosclerosis, a condition characterized by plaque buildup in the arteries. Previous research has established that high blood glucose levels, hypertension, and dyslipidemia are risk factors for atherosclerosis development in diabetic individuals. Individuals with thyroid hormone resistance may exhibit elevated levels of circulating cholesterol and triglycerides, decreased levels of HDL‐C, and decreased systemic insulin sensitivity. Our study performed a correlation analysis to investigate the relationship between TFQI and various metabolic markers. TFQI was positively correlated with HbA1c, FPG, and UA, whereas TFQI was negatively correlated with HDL‐C. The outcomes of this study demonstrate that the use of TFQI can serve as a beneficial method for detecting minor acquired thyroid hormone resistance in the general population. This condition is often linked to energy imbalance.

### Impaired central thyroid hormone sensitivity is associated with time in range in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus in the euthyroid population [^3b4f90c6]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In patients with T2DM in the euthyroid population, with the decrease of central TH sensitivity, namely, the increase of TH resistance, the level of TIR increases accordingly, as well as the odds of TIR-target. We speculate that TH resistance may be a protective factor for TIR, and the possible mechanism may be the body's compensatory regulation under the chronic hyperglycemic state.

### Thyroid function, glycemic control, and diabetic nephropathy in patients with type 2 diabetes over 24 months: prospective observational study [^5eb3d620]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Thyroid dysfunction is one of the most common health problems. According to the Japan Thyroid Association, the prevalence of thyroid disease including thyroid nodules is estimated to be between 5 and 7 million (approximately 4 to 5.5% of the general population) in Japan. Diabetes is also a highly prevalent disease, with estimated prevalence in Japan is 18.7% in men and 9.3% in women according to the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2018. Due to such high prevalence of these two disorders, a number of patients are likely to have both diabetes and thyroid dysfunction concurrently. The prevalence of thyroid dysfunction is suggested to be disproportionately higher in patients with diabetes than in the general population.

When the prevalence of thyroid dysfunction in patients with diabetes is examined, patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes should be treated separately. Patients with type 1 diabetes are well-known to have an increased risk of developing other autoimmune disorders, including autoimmune thyroid disease. The etiology of comorbidity between type 1 diabetes and autoimmune thyroid disease is at least partially attributable to the common genetic background susceptibility to these two diseases.

The prevalence of thyroid dysfunction has been widely reported to be high in patients with type 2 diabetes, but others argue that the incidence of thyroid dysfunction is not dissimilar to that of the general population. Thyroid hormones have a wide variety of physiological actions, some of which affect glucose metabolism. These actions include stimulation of general metabolism, absorption of glucose from the gut, and lipolysis. Administration of thyroid hormone to healthy volunteers induces insulin resistance and hyperglycemia, and patients with thyrotoxicosis show oxyhyperglycemia and insulin resistance. Hyperthyroidism can induce diabetes, which in Japan is classified as diabetes by other causes, although it may sometimes be misclassified as type 2 diabetes when hyperthyroidism is overlooked. Conversely, hypothyroidism causes obesity due to the reduced general metabolic rate, which induces insulin resistance, eventually leading to glucose intolerance.

There are no known reports that directly compare the prevalence of thyroid dysfunction in patients with and without type 2 diabetes in Japan. Furthermore, although several reports have suggested the association between subclinical hypothyroidism and diabetic nephropathy and retinopathy, these studies are basically cross-sectional, however, and there are no prospective studies.

In this study, the prevalence of thyroid dysfunction in patients with type 2 diabetes are compared with that in control subjects without diabetes. We analyze the relationship between thyroid function and metabolic parameters and examine the effects of basal thyroid function on future glucose control and diabetic nephropathy. Additionally, the occurrences thyroid disease in diabetic patients are monitored during the course of observation.

### Does an episode of diabetic ketoacidosis affect thyroid function tests in pediatric patients? [^18dca33e]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The aim of our study was to investigate the changes in thyroid hormone levels during and after acute metabolic disorder in patients with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).

Methods

Eighty five patients diagnosed with DKA were included in the study. Patients with control thyroid function test (TFT) values at admission (the first blood sample) and 1 month later were included in the study. Thyroid function tests obtained during diabetic ketoacidosis and at the first month follow-up were compared. Euthyroidism and euthyroid sick syndrome were defined and grouped according to current guidelines. The mild and moderate groups, according to DKA classification, were combined and compared with the severe group.

Results

A significant increase was observed between the first admission and the control TFT values 1 month later. However, there was no significant difference found in TFT between mild/moderate and severe groups taken at the time of DKA. Difference between two groups, euthyroid sick syndrome and euthyroid, was examined and the result that was different from the literature was the difference between TSH levels. We found that low FT4 levels were associated with higher HgbA1c, although the correlation was weak.

Conclusions

Thyroid hormone levels may not reflect a thyroid disease during severe DKA attack. Therefore, it is unnecessary to check thyroid function tests.

### Correlation between the thyroid hormone levels and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in type 2 diabetic patients with normal thyroid function [^4a9d0802]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The objective of this study is to retrospectively analyze the correlation between the thyroid hormones and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients with normal thyroid function.

Methods

Totally 586 T2DM patients with normal thyroid function participated in this research and were divided into T2DM without NAFLD (240 cases) group and T2DM with NAFLD (346 cases) group. The NAFLD fibrosis score (NFS) > 0.676 was defined as progressive liver fibrosis and used to categorize the patients into T2DM without progressive liver fibrosis group (493 cases) and T2DM with progressive liver fibrosis group (93 cases).

Results

The results indicated that the levels of free triiodothyronine (FT3), total triiodomethylamine (TT3) and FT3/free thyroxine ratio (FT3/FT4) were significantly higher while the FT4 level was lower in T2DM with NAFLD group than that in T2DM without NAFLD group (p < 0.05). The levels of FT3, FT4, TT3 and TT4 in patients with progressive liver fibrosis were significantly lower in patients with progressive liver fibrosis than that in patients without progressive liver fibrosis (p < 0.05). Logistic regression analysis showed a positive connection between FT3/FT4 ratio and NAFLD (p = 0.038), a negative relationship between FT4 level and NAFLD (p = 0.026), between the levels of FT4, TT3 and total thyroxine (TT4) and the risk of progressive hepatic fibrosis (p = 0.022, p = 0.007, p = 0.046).

Conclusion

There is a certain correlation between thyroid hormone levels and NAFLD in T2DM patients, suggesting that the assessment of thyroid hormone levels in T2DM patients with normal thyroid function could be helpful in the prevention and treatment of NAFLD.

### Association between decreased thyroid stimulating hormone and hyperuricemia in type 2 diabetic patients with early-stage diabetic kidney disease [^eecaf0b6]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is greatly increasing, and many patients suffer from diabetes-related complications. Diabetic kidney disease (DKD), one of the major microvascular complications of diabetes, is the main cause of end-stage renal disease and is associated with high morbidity and mortality.

In human beings, uric acid (UA) is the end product in purine metabolism, and approximately 70% of UA is eliminated through the kidney. The increased serum uric acid (SUA) has been reported to be correlated with the progression of insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome, and T2DM. Recently, SUA has been documented to cause the development of microvascular diseases and thereby renal injury in DKD by several reported effects, including inducing the endothelial dysfunction, causing the inflammatory cascades, activating the profibrotic cytokine, and increasing the activity of the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system. Clinical research has found that SUA was significantly associated with albuminuria in patients with T2DM. Therefore, the elevated SUA has been regarded as one of the major predictors of DKD.

Accumulating evidence has indicated that thyroid hormones can regulate metabolism and insulin resistance. Thyroid dysfunction can worsen glucose metabolism and induce hyperglycemia in patients with T2DM, promoting the risk of diabetic complications. Hyperglycemia decreases the level of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and reduces the conversion of thyroxine to triiodothyronine in the peripheral tissues. There have been several studies about the relationship between SUA and thyroid function in different populations. However, the results were conflicting. Some studies supported that there was a higher risk of hyperuricemia in patients with hypothyroidism or with subclinical hypothyroidism relative in comparison to the general subjects, and there was a negative correlation between SUA and free triiodothyronine (FT3) in participants with low UA contents. On the other hand, a linear relationship between free thyroxine (FT4) and SUA was observed in individuals without overt thyroid dysfunction. Moreover, a recent study has also demonstrated that the decrease of SUA by the treatment of febuxostat or allopurinol led to the increase of TSH in patients with gout.

### Thyroid dysfunction and type 2 diabetes mellitus: screening strategies and implications for management [^0abbfc81]. Diabetes Therapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Diabetes mellitus (DM) and thyroid dysfunction (TD) are endocrinopathies that are commonly seen in routine practice, and they frequently coexist. A high prevalence of TD is seen among both type 1 (T1DM) and type 2 (T2DM) diabetes mellitus patients. Autoimmunity can explain the common linkage between T1DM and autoimmune thyroid diseases; however, the linkage between T2DM and TD is more complicated. This review summarizes current knowledge about coexistent T2DM and TD and discusses enhanced screening recommendations as well as clinical implications for the management of these two endocrinopathies. This article is based on previously conducted studies and does not contain any studies with human participants or animals performed by any of the authors.

### Maternal pre-pregnancy obesity modifies the association between first-trimester thyroid hormone sensitivity and gestational diabetes mellitus: a retrospective study from Northern China [^7b04d30c]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2023). Medium credibility.

Plenty of studies have confirmed the regulating role of the thyroid system on glucose homeostasis and GDM, although with inconsistent conclusions. Here, we uncovered contrary relationships between the indices of sensitivity to thyroid hormones and GDM under different pBMI status. This novel discovery indicated the complex interactions between pre-pregnancy energy status, hormone homeostasis and metabolic phenotype. Paradoxical results were also observed in non-pregnant population. Although studies have confirmed that reduced sensitivity to thyroid hormones (increased composite indices) was positively associated with diabetes and diabetes-related death, no association between TFQI and new-onset diabetes was observed. Moreover, one study indicated a protective role of reduced sensitivity to thyroid hormones on pre-diabetes in non-pregnant population. In line with our findings under non-obese status, both FT4 and TSH have been shown to be associated with a higher risk of GDM. However, an adverse relationship was observed under obese status. To our knowledge, there was only one study addressed a negative link between TFQI and GDM. However, they did not explore the modifying effect of pBMI. In GDM women of non-obese group, reduced sensitivity to thyroid hormone was concomitant with a worse metabolic phenotype such as hyperlipidemia, higher BMI levels during early gestation. However, it appears that reduced sensitivity to thyroid hormones was an adaptable protective factor against energy oversupply under obese status, as the early pregnancy metabolic parameters among GDM and non-GDM subjects were comparable in addition to reduced resistance to thyroid hormones. Furthermore, most previous studies indicated a protective role of FT4 in the occurrence of GDM, indicating a complex modulation effect of thyroid homeostasis on glucose metabolism. The discrepancy in both previous studies and our results may be attributed to the dual effects of thyroid hormones on glucose homeostasis, as it could not only lower glucose levels by increasing glucose utilization but also up regulate glucose levels by stimulating hepatic glycogenolysis and glucose intestinal absorption. It is worth noting that, compared to non-pregnant population with diabetes, women with GDM had relatively less impaired glycemic control and energy imbalance. Collectively, further investigation is warranted for analyzing the contrary relationships in pregnant population.

### Assessment of the simultaneous effect of hypothyroidism and thyroid autoimmunity with gestational diabetes on the incidence of type 2 diabetes [^d07e637b]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In conclusion, no synergistic association was found between GDM and thyroid disorders on the incidence of T2DM. However, women with a history of GDM were at higher risk of developing T2DM later in their life. As women age, the risk of T2DM incidence is also increasing. Given the significant prevalence of T2DM, targeted healthcare systems, and lifestyle modification are recommended.

### Relationship between thyroid dysfunction and diabetes… [^6781ed1d]. ClinicalTrials (2025). Medium credibility.

Relationship Between Thyroid Dysfunction and DiabetesClinicalTrials. gov ID Study Overview Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by insulin resistance and impaired insulin secretion, resulting in persistent hyperglycemia. In T2DM, the response to insulin is diminished, and this is defined as insulin resistance. During this state, insulin is ineffective and is initially countered by an increase in insulin production to maintain glucose homeostasis, but over time, insulin production decreases, resulting in T2DM. Glycemic parameters are critical indicators for diagnosing and monitoring diabetes mellitus. The most commonly used measures include fasting blood glucose, postprandial blood glucose, and glycated hemoglobin. Among them, HbA1c reflects the average blood glucose levels over the previous two to three months and is considered a reliable marker of chronic hyperglycemia. Diabetic dyslipidemia constitutes a distinct cluster of plasma lipid and lipoprotein abnormalities that are metabolically interconnected in individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus. This condition is predominantly characterized by elevated triglyceride concentrations, reduced levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. The underlying mechanism involves insulin resistance, which disrupts normal lipid metabolism by enhancing hepatic very low-density lipoprotein synthesis and impairing the clearance of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins. Prevalence of thyroid dysfunction is greater in diabetes patients compared to the general population. 1–3 Prevalence of thyroid dysfunction in general population is around 6. 6–13. 4%, while in diabetes population around 10–24%.

1 Studies found that subclinical hypothyroidism is the most common thyroid dysfunction in diabetic population Emerging evidence suggests a complex interplay between glycemic control, lipid metabolism, and thyroid function in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Poor glycemic control has been associated with adverse lipid profiles and alterations in thyroid hormone levels, which may collectively contribute to the progression of diabetic complications. Thyroid hormones influence both glucose and lipid metabolism by regulating hepatic glucose production, lipolysis, and insulin sensitivity.

Effect of Drugs on Thyroid Function and Glycaemic Control

Drugs administered for diabetes, TD, and other comorbidities can alter thyroid function or glycaemic control in persons with coexisting T2DM and TD (Table 3). Dose adjustments or a change in treatment regimen may be required.

Effects of various drugs in coexistent diabetes and thyroid disorders

T2DM type 2 diabetes mellitus, TSH thyroid-stimulating hormone, TD thyroid disorder, IGF1 insulin-like growth factor-1, FT4 free thyroxine

There are also reports of increased incidence of thyroid cancer with antidiabetic drugs such as incretin mimetics and insulin analogues. However, the evidence is not strong enough to discourage the use of these antidiabetic medications.

Role of Thyroid Hormone Analogues

Thyroid hormones affect the metabolism of lipids, proteins, and carbohydrates. Strategies are being explored for the use of thyroid hormone analogues in the management of diabetes, obesity, and atherosclerosis. Researchers are searching for potent thyromimetics that can exert the desired therapeutic effects without producing the harmful effects of thyroid hormones.

### The impact of the metabolic phenotype on thyroid function in obesity [^8b3e09e7]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Thyroid disorders impact body weight in multiple ways, and hypothyroidism is traditionally claimed as a contributor of weight accrual via altered metabolic efficiency, water retention, decreased lipolysis. Nonetheless, case-control studies and epidemiological surveys revealed that TSH levels tend to follow body weight accrual as well as development of obesity and insulin resistance, independent of hypothyroidism. The causal mechanism underlying this link remains unidentified, yet a compensatory response operated by the hypotalamo-pituitary unit via leptin and directed to counteract weight accrual, is very likely involved.

Obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and thyroid diseases are the most frequent endocrine disorders and often coexist in the same individual. Following an original case study, cross-sectional and prospective studies have shown that the antidiabetic drug metformin can decrease TSH levels in patients with subclinical and/or overt hypothyroidism, while other antidiabetic agents do not yield such effect. In subsequent studies, it has been clarified that metformin can alter TSH levels also in euthyroid subjects if TSH levels lay in the mid-high normal range (i.e. > 2.5–3.0 mIU/L).

Considering the metabolic derangement commonly associated with obesity as well as the frequent use of metformin in overweight patients owing to its insulin-sensitizing effect and potential reduction of body weight, we aimed at assessing the impact of the metabolic phenotype, metformin-treated diabetes mellitus, and incident diabetes mellitus on thyroid function in euthyroid obese patients, and thus further investigating the potential thyroidal determinants of cardiometabolic risk in this setting.

### The association between thyroid function and insulin resistance as measured by the metabolic score for insulin resistance (METS-IR): insights from NHANES 2007–2012 [^23f92f9a]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Thyroid disorders affect approximately 200 million people worldwide, with over 12% of the U.S. population expected to develop a thyroid condition during their lifetime. Traditionally, based on hormonal levels, individuals have been categorized into three main groups: hypothyroidism, euthyroidism, and hyperthyroidism. However, for a more nuanced understanding of thyroid function and its effects, some research considers a broader spectrum of thyroid states. Euthyroidism represents normal thyroid hormone production and levels. Subclinical hypothyroidism is characterized by mildly insufficient thyroid stimulating hormone production and normal thyroid hormones levels, while overt hypothyroidism indicates a severe deficiency of thyroid hormones. Conversely, subclinical hyperthyroidism is marked by a mild overproduction of thyroid stimulating hormone, and overt hyperthyroidism represents a pronounced excess of thyroid hormones. The prevalence of these conditions varies, with categories of hypothyroidism affecting approximately 4.6% of the U.S. population and hyperthyroidism affecting about 1.3% of Americans. These thyroid dysfunctions can have far-reaching effects on various metabolic processes, including glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity.

Insulin resistance (IR) is defined as reduced sensitivity of muscles, liver, and adipose tissue to insulin, resulting in an impaired biological response and leading to compensatory hyperinsulinemia over time. IR is associated with several chronic conditions, including obesity, type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. While the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp test remains the gold standard for measuring IR, its clinical application is limited due to ethical and economic considerations. Consequently, the metabolic score for insulin resistance (METS-IR) was developed as a novel, non-insulin-based index derived from routinely measured markers such as fasting plasma glucose, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and body mass index. METS-IR has demonstrated high accuracy comparable to the clamp test and strong associations with cardiometabolic conditions, highlighting its potential as a practical tool for detecting and preventing IR-related diseases.

### The association between thyroid function and insulin resistance as measured by the metabolic score for insulin resistance (METS-IR): insights from NHANES 2007–2012 [^acb0911a]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This population-based, cross-sectional study provides new findings on the relationship between METS-IR and thyroid function, either as a continuous or a categorical variable. To guide interpretation, we present three regression models - an unadjusted association, a fully adjusted estimate addressing all potential confounders, and an intermediate adjustment controlling for key demographic factors, offering a balanced effect size between the approaches. We found that higher TSH levels was positively associated with METS-IR, adjusting for confounders. Notably, gender differences emerged in subclinical disorders: males showed increased risk with subclinical hypothyroidism, while females showed increased risk with subclinical hyperthyroidism. Additionally, TPO positivity strengthened the association in overt hypothyroidism, suggesting a potential role of autoimmunity in this relationship. Also, our study found a significant association with TSH rather than free T4 in the euthyroid group.

To our knowledge, this is the first study to assess the association between thyroid status and METS-IR. We controlled for confounding covariates to ensure that our results were reliable and applicable to a broad range of individuals, followed by collecting data from a representative sample of the US population. The relationship we observed between thyroid function and METS-IR suggests that even small changes in thyroid status might impact insulin sensitivity. This finding could have important clinical implications, potentially suggesting more attention to thyroid function in patients at risk for metabolic disorders.

Our study's use of METS-IR to assess insulin resistance in relation to thyroid function offers new insights into this complex relationship. IR, a state where cells fail to respond properly to insulin, leading to compensatory hyperinsulinemia, has been linked to various metabolic disorders including type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and fatty liver disease. Several surrogate markers have been developed and improved to simply measure IR instead of the euglycemic–hyperinsulinemic clamp technique, the gold standard, due to its invasive and expensive nature.

### Correlation of serum thyrotropin and thyroid hormone levels with diabetic kidney disease: a cross-sectional study [^d94c3e9f]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

The relationship between thyrotropin (TSH), free triiodothyronine (FT3), free thyroxine (FT4) and diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is still controversial, and this study analyzed the correlation between TSH, FT3, FT4 and DKD in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

Methods

T2DM patients (1216) were divided into five groups based on serum TSH, FT3, and FT4 levels, differences in urinary albumin excretion rate (UACR), estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) were compared. Binary logistic regression verified independent correlations among TSH, FT3, FT4 and UACR, eGFR. TSH and FT3 predictive values for DKD were analyzed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves.

Results

The prevalence of albuminuria with decreased eGFR was higher in T2DM patients with subclinical hypothyroidism and overt hypothyroidism than that in patients with normal thyroid function. TSH positively correlated with UACR (r = 0.133, p < 0.001) and positively correlated with eGFR (r = -0.218, p < 0.001), FT3 negatively correlated with UACR (r = -0.260, p < 0.001) and positively correlated with eGFR (r = 0.324, p < 0.001). With the change from the lower normal level to the increased level of TSH and the change from the higher normal level to the reduced level of FT3, the prevalence of albuminuria gradually increased, the prevalence of decreased eGFR gradually increased in TSH groups and FT3 groups. After adjusting for age, BMI, duration of diabetes, TPOAb, TGAb, smoking, drinking, hypertension, the use of anti-diabetic medications (metformin, sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors), HbA1c, CRP, TC, TG, LDL-C, and HDL-C, both TSH and FT3 correlated with increased UACR (TSH: OR 1.253, p = 0.001; FT3: OR 0.166, p < 0.001) and decreased eGFR (TSH: OR 1.245, p < 0.001, FT3: OR 0.579, p < 0.001), but this correlation of TSH with eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m² was not found in male. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) for FT3 was greater than that for TSH (FT3: 0.64; TSH: 0.61).

Conclusions

Increased TSH and reduced FT3 levels were associated with DKD in T2DM patients, but in a sex-dependent manner. FT3 had a higher predictive value for DKD.

### Insulin resistance and pancreatic β cell dysfunction are associated with thyroid hormone functions: a cross-sectional hospital-based study in Turkey [^c06d3cdb]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2020). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

The prevalence of thyroid disease in diabetic patients is significantly higher than the general population. This indicates a possible interaction between thyroid functions and insulin sensitivity. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between insulin resistance (IR), pancreatic β cell function, and thyroid function tests.

Methods

This cross-sectional study was conducted with adults who applied to Eskişehir Osmangazi University Hospital for general control. Fasting insulin, glucose, TSH, fT3, and fT4 levels in the serum of 1340 adult (18–60 aged) patients without any chronic diseases were examined retrospectively. The fT3/fT4 ratio, Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR), and HOMA-β values were calculated. The correlation between HOMA-IR and HOMA-β values with thyroid function tests and differences between hormone levels of patients with and without IR were evaluated.

Results

There was a positive correlation between HOMA-IR and TSH, negative with fT4. Also, a positive correlation between HOMA-β and fT3, negative correlation with fT4 were observed. In the IR group, fT3 levels were found significantly higher and fT4 levels were significantly lower. TSH levels were higher in the IR group but not statistically significant. The fT3/fT4 ratio was found significantly higher in the IR group and was correlated positively with both HOMA-IR and HOMA-β.

Conclusion

Our results revealed that thyroid dysfunction prevalence is quite high in adults who have not yet been diagnosed with diabetes but have insulin resistance and the onset of pancreatic β cell dysfunction.

### Association between thyroid stimulating hormone levels and nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy: a cross-sectional study [^34cce994]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The association between thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is well known. However, whether TSH is related to nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) has not been studied. This study aimed to explore the relationship between TSH and NPDR in Chinese patients with T2DM.

Methods

In this cross-sectional study, 427 patients with T2DM were enrolled. The individuals were classified into two groups according to the fundus oculi examination: the non-diabetic retinopathy (NDR) group (n = 224) and the non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) group (n = 203). The individuals' demographic and clinical data were collected by reviewing medical records and direct interviews. The demographic data and biochemical parameters were compared between groups using the Student's t - test or the Mann‒Whitney U test, anthropometric measurements, thyroid function, and NPDR were evaluated, and the associations between TSH and NPDR were assessed using logistic regression models.

Results

No significant differences in age, sex, body mass index (BMI), incidence of alcohol consumption, and duration of diabetes were found between these two groups. The systolic blood pressure (SBP), incidence of smoking, TSH, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and urinary micro-albumin (mALB) were significantly higher in the NPDR group than in the NDR group (P < 0.05). Individuals in the NDR group had higher levels of thyroxine (T4), glutamic pyruvic transaminase (ALT), fasting C-peptide (FCP), and 2-hour C-peptide (2hCP) than individuals in the NPDR group (P < 0.05). Spearman's correlation analysis revealed that the serum TSH levels were negatively associated with the HbA1c levels in all patients (r = -0.11, P < 0.05). Serum TSH levels were negatively correlated with HbA1c levels (r = -0.19, P < 0.01) and positively correlated with diabetes duration (r = 0.14, P < 0.05) in the NPDR group. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that high TSH levels, sex, diabetes duration, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), FCP, and SBP were associated with NPDR [odds ratio (OR) > 1, P < 0.05]. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis revealed that the optimal cutoff point of TSH for predicting NPDR was 2.235mIU/L.

Conclusion

The TSH level is independently associated with NPDR in the Chinese population with T2DM. A high serum TSH level may be a potential risk factor for NPDR and an indicator for screening for diabetic microangiopathy.

Trial Registration

This study is registered with the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (02/21/2025 ChiCTR2500097614).

### The role of thyroid hormone in metabolism and metabolic syndrome [^5ef850ed]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Metabolic syndrome (MetS) and thyroid dysfunction are common in clinical practice. The objectives of this review are to discuss some proposed mechanisms by which thyroid dysfunctions may lead to MetS, to describe the bidirectional relationship between thyroid hormones (THs) and adiposity and finally, to resume a list of recent studies in humans that evaluated possible associations between thyroid hormone status and MetS or its clinical components. Not solely THs, but also its metabolites regulate metabolic rate, influencing adiposity. The mechanisms enrolled are related to its direct effect on adenosine triphosphate (ATP) utilization, uncoupling synthesis of ATP, mitochondrial biogenesis, and its inotropic and chronotropic effects. THs also act controlling core body temperature, appetite, and sympathetic activity. In a bidirectional way, thyroid function is affected by adiposity. Leptin is one of the hallmarks, but the pro-inflammatory cytokines and also insulin resistance impact thyroid function and perhaps its structure. MetS development and weight gain have been positively associated with thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) in several studies. Adverse glucose metabolism may be related to hyperthyroidism, but also to reduction of thyroid function or higher serum TSH, as do abnormal serum triglyceride levels. Hypo- and hyperthyroidism have been related to higher blood pressure (BP), that may be consequence of genomic or nongenomic action of THs on the vasculature and in the heart. In summary, the interaction between THs and components of MetS is complex and not fully understood. More longitudinal studies controlling each of all confounding variables that interact with endpoints or exposure factors are still necessary.

### Thyroid-stimulating hormone, anti-thyroid antibodies, and pregnancy outcomes [^abff6364]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Overt thyroid dysfunction has been associated with adverse obstetric outcomes. However, less is known regarding subclinical hypothyroidism or thyroid autoimmunity and their relationship to pregnancy complications.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to examine the association between prepregnancy anti-thyroid antibodies and subclinical hypothyroidism and preterm delivery, gestational diabetes mellitus, and preeclampsia.

Study Design

We conducted a secondary analysis of a prospective cohort of 18- to 40-year-old women with 1–2 previous pregnancy losses (n = 1193) who participated in a multicenter randomized, placebo-controlled trial of low-dose aspirin. Prepregnancy levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone, free thyroxine, thyroglobulin antibody, and thyroid peroxidase antibody were measured. Relative risks and 95% confidence intervals were estimated with the use of generalized linear models with adjustment for age and body mass index.

Results

Among women with an ongoing pregnancy of > 20 weeks estimated gestational age, there was no association between prepregnancy thyroid-stimulating hormone level (> 2.5 vs ≤ 2.5 mIU/L) and preterm delivery (adjusted relative risk, 0.77; 95% confidence interval, 0.40–1.47), gestational diabetes mellitus (adjusted relative risk, 1.28; 95% confidence interval, 0.54–3.04), or preeclampsia (adjusted relative risk, 1.20; 95% confidence interval, 0.71–2.04). Similarly, among women with thyroid antibodies, there was no increase in the likelihood of preterm delivery (relative risk, 1.26; 95% confidence interval, 0.65–2.45), gestational diabetes mellitus (relative risk, 1.33; 95% confidence interval, 0.51–3.49), or preeclampsia (relative risk, 1.02; 95% confidence interval, 0.54–1.92), compared with women without these antibodies.

Conclusion

Among women with 1–2 previous pregnancy losses, subclinical hypothyroidism and thyroid autoimmunity were not associated with an increased risk of preterm delivery, gestational diabetes mellitus, or preeclampsia. These data support current recommendations that low-risk asymptomatic women should not be screened routinely for thyroid dysfunction or autoimmunity.

### Association between thyroid hormones and body fat in euthyroid subjects [^bfd1bf5d]. Clinical Endocrinology (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

Thyroid hormones disorders are associated with changes of body composition. However, the relationship between thyroid hormones and body fat in a euthyroid population is unclear. The aim of this study was to explore the association between thyroid hormones and body fat in a euthyriod population.

Subjects

A total of 865 euthyroid individuals were recruited in this study. Subjects with thyroid diseases or diabetes and who were taking medications that could influence thyroid hormones, weight or glucose metabolism were excluded.

Measurements

FT3, FT4, lipid parameters, fasting insulin (FINS) and blood glucose were determined, and homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was calculated. Anthropometric measurements were taken, and body fat parameters were assessed.

Results

Serum FT3 was slightly higher in body mass index (BMI) ≥ 25 kg/m(2) group than that in BMI < 25 kg/m(2) group (P < 0·05). However, the difference was too small to have clinical significance. FT4 levels were not significantly different between the two groups. Body weight, BMI, waist circumference, hip circumference, waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), percentage of body fat (PBF), waist-fat-to-hip-fat ratio, FINS and HOMA-IR increased linearly with the elevation of FT3 adjusted for age and gender. A multivariate linear regression analysis revealed that fat mass, PBF, HOMA-IR and FT4 contributed significantly to FT3 levels.

Conclusion

Grouped according to BMI, overweight and obese subjects have similar thyroid hormones compared to those with normal weight. Body composition parameters increase with the elevation of FT3, and FT3 is associated with body fat parameters in euthyroid subjects.

### Executive summary: standards of medical care in diabetes – 2009 [^3734f42a]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Hypothyroidism

Patients with type 1 diabetes should be screened for thyroid peroxidase and thyroglobulin antibodies at diagnosis. (E)
Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) concentrations should be measured after metabolic control has been established. If normal, they should be rechecked every 1–2 years or if the patient develops symptoms of thyroid dysfunction, thyromegaly, or an abnormal growth rate. Free T4 should be measured if TSH is abnormal. (E)

Preconception Care

A1C levels should be as close to normal as possible (< 7%) in an individual patient before conception is attempted. (B)
Starting at puberty, preconception counseling should be incorporated in the routine diabetes clinic visit for all women of child-bearing potential. (C)
Women with diabetes who are contemplating pregnancy should be evaluated and, if indicated, treated for diabetic retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy, and CVD. (E)
Medications used by such women should be evaluated before conception, since drugs commonly used to treat diabetes and its complications may be contraindicated or not recommended in pregnancy, including statins, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and most noninsulin therapies. (E)

### Thyroid dysfunction and glycaemic control among type 2 diabetes mellitus patients in Ghana: a comparative cross-sectional study [^b95341ab]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

Thyroid dysfunction is the most common endocrinopathy that coexist with diabetics and it has and may influence dysregulation of glycaemic control. The development of diabetes complications is known to be dependent on the magnitude, duration and also frequency of hyperglycaemic events, which may be influenced by thyroid dysfunction. In this study, we observed that thyroid dysfunction increases with hyperglycaemia among T2DM patients. The first tertiles of TSH and T3 were independently associated with increased odds of hyperglycaemia.

This study observed decreased TSH levels, increased FT4 and almost unchanged FT3 levels in MH and SH patients compared to the good glycaemic controls. Different levels of TSH have been ascribed to modification of the production and secretion of thyrotrophin releasing hormone by the hypothalamus.TRH and TSH play a key role in the secretion and maintenance of circulating thyroid hormones which control glucose homeostasis and eventually glycaemic levels. There is also what is called thyroid hormone‐binding inhibitor (THBI) which according to Suzuki et al.contributed to the abnormal thyroid hormone levels in diabetes. THBI is an inhibitor of the extra thyroidal conversion enzyme (5′‐deiodinase) of T4 to T3. The presence of THBI impedes the peripheral conversion of T4 to T3 and thus affecting the levels of T4. This probably accounted for the elevated levels of FT4 and normal or low normal levels of FT3 of those with hyperglycaemia (SH and MH) compared to the good glycaemic controls in this study. The imbalanced hormonal levels as a consequence of diabetes and increased stress levels largely affect the mechanisms that regulates plasma glucose. Intestinal absorption of glucose, changes in circulating insulin levels, increased insulin resistance, hepatic production and peripheral tissues uptake of glucose have been reported as regulatory mechanisms that are affected by thyroid hormones.

Data extraction and quality assessment

Y.W. extracted data along with relevant information from all selected articles and entered it into a standard form. The content included general information of the articles (first author's name, year published, and country), participants (number of participants and T2DM/CVD/CVD-related cases, sex percentage, race percentage, age range, mean/median/range of BMI, and thyroid medication use), study design (follow-up years, outcomes, adjusted variables, and comparisons). If two articles derived from the same study population both reported HRs/ORs, the one with a larger sample size was selected. The accuracy of the data and information was confirmed by another researcher (F.R.).

The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) was applied to assess the quality of identified prospective studies. Three components of the NOS scale, selection, comparability, and outcome were used to rate the studies as low quality (≤ 6 stars) or high quality (> 6 stars).

Importantly, we reported in present study that FT4 was higher, and TSH was lower in patients with hyperuricemia in type 2 diabetic patients with early-stage DKD compared with patients with normal SUA level in type 2 diabetic patients with early-stage DKD and in the controls. TSH was negatively correlated with SUA in type 2 diabetic participants with early-stage DKD. The multiple regression analysis showed that after adjusting for the confounders, the decreased TSH was independently related to the higher SUA in type 2 diabetic patients with early-stage DKD. The logistic regression analysis presented that the reduction of TSH was independently associated with hyperuricemia in type 2 diabetic patients with early-stage DKD. Our findings suggested an association between thyroid function, TSH in particular, and UA metabolism in type 2 diabetic patients with early-stage DKD.

The association between SUA and thyroid function has been assessed in different populations in several previous studies which provided controversial results. An increase in hyperuricemia rates was observed in patients with hypothyroidism and in patients with subclinical hypothyroidism compared to the general individuals, but no relationship between hypothyroidism and hyperuricemia was found in these studies. FT3 was found to be negatively related to SUA in participants with low SUA levels. Moreover, another research reported no relationship between SUA and thyroid hormones in patients with thyroid dysfunction. However, the majority of previous studies are consistent with our findings. A previous study documented that the risk of hyperuricemia was significantly increased in individuals with higher FT4 level. Additionally, a recent study also demonstrated that the decrease of SUA by the treatment of febuxostat or allopurinol exerted effects on the elevation of TSH in patients with gout. These controversial findings might result from the confounding factors of study participants, including race, age, gender, health condition, medical history and so on.

### Impaired central thyroid hormone sensitivity is associated with time in range in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus in the euthyroid population [^039bfded]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To investigate the correlation between central thyroid hormone (TH) sensitivity and time in target glucose range (TIR) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

Methods

483 enrolled inpatients with T2DM were collected with the continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data and clinical characteristics. Thyroid stimulating hormone index (TSHI), thyrotropin-thyroxine resistance index (TT4RI) and thyroid feedback quantile index (TFQI) were calculated. The correlations between TSHI, TT4RI, TFQI and TIR were statistically analyzed.

Results

The levels of FT4, TSHI, TT4RI and TFQI in TIR > 70% group were all higher compared with TIR ≤ 70% group (all P < 0.05). TSHI was positively correlated with TIR before the inflection point of 2.2 (β = 14.8, P < 0.001), and the correlation strengthened after there (β = 30.9, P < 0.001). TT4RI was positively correlated with TIR before the inflection point of 32 (β = 1.3, P < 0.001), and the correlation weakened after there (β = 0.7, P < 0.001). TFQI was not correlated with TIR before the inflection point of -0.6 (P = 0.302), but was positively correlated with TIR after there (β = 28.7, P < 0.001). For one-quartile increase in TSHI and TFQI, the odds of TIR-target (TIR > 70%) increased by 0.825 times and 1.3891 times respectively.

Conclusion

Decreased central TH sensitivity, namely increased TH resistance, is associated with elevated TIR, suggesting that central TH resistance maybe a protective factor for TIR.

### Evaluation and treatment of recurrent pregnancy loss: a committee opinion [^84af2af5]. Fertility and Sterility (2012). Medium credibility.

Hormonal and metabolic factors — maternal endocrine disorders (e.g., diabetes, thyroid dysfunction) should be evaluated and treated; as long as thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels are in the normal range, there is insufficient evidence to recommend routine thyroxine (T4) testing or screening for anti-thyroid antibodies; whereas TSH values of 4.0–5.0 mIU/L were once considered normal, a consensus is emerging that TSH values above 2.5 mIU/L are outside the normal range; well-controlled diabetes is not a risk factor for RPL, whereas uncontrolled diabetes is associated with increased pregnancy loss.

### Thyroid dysfunction and glycaemic control among type 2 diabetes mellitus patients in Ghana: a comparative cross-sectional study [^71c73942]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a multifaceted metabolic disorder that results from insulin resistance and pancreatic beta‐cell dysfunction. T2DM is the most common form of diabetes mellitus (DM) and accounts for about 90% of all DM cases. It is a complex condition that arise from a combination of lifestyle and genetic factors. About 415 million adults suffer from T2DM globally. In Ghana, the prevalence of T2DM is estimated to be 6% in the urban population. Comparable to diabetes, thyroid dysfunction emanates from uncontrolled hormone production and secretion. Hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism which are the common thyroid disorders have been observed to be more common in T2DM patients compared to nondiabetic patients.

Thyroid hormones regulate many cells and organs, and may affect protein, lipid and glucose metabolism, which in turn may exacerbate glycaemic control. However, treatment guidelines for T2DM are not specific about how often thyroid function should be monitored in T2DM patients. Moreover, thyroid dysfunction can aggravate subclinical DM and results in hyperglycaemia increasing the risk of diabetic complications. Again, changes in thyroid hormone concentration can predispose prediabetes to overt T2DM.

Consequently, thyroid disorders and diabetes mellitus coexist and are among the main endocrinopathies commonly found in the adult population. Uncontrolled blood glucose levels, frequency of hyperglycaemia and duration of diabetes has also been observed to affect the hypothalamic — anterior pituitary — thyroid axis.T2DM decreases thyroid‐stimulating hormone and impedes the production of thyroxine (T4) from triiodothyronine (T3). Thyroid hormones increase beta‐cell apoptosis and this could be a major element responsible for deterioration of glucose tolerance in thyrotoxicosis. It is known that the discovery of abnormal thyroid hormones as well as other biochemical parameters in the initial stages of diabetes can assist in providing appropriate clinical intervention for patients. However, T2DM and thyroid dysfunction least investigated among Ghanaians. There is paucity of data and contradicting findings on how thyroid dysfunction influence glycaemic control among T2DM. This study therefore evaluated thyroid dysfunction and glycaemic control among T2DM patients in the Western Region of Ghana.

### The association between thyroid function and insulin resistance as measured by the metabolic score for insulin resistance (METS-IR): insights from NHANES 2007–2012 [^88f2f2f5]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

This large population-based study using NHANES data provides novel insights into the relationship between varying states of thyroid function and levels of insulin resistance as quantified by the METS-IR index. Specifically, we found that higher levels of TSH within the reference range, as well as certain subclinical thyroid disorders such as hypothyroidism in males and hyperthyroidism in females, were significantly associated with an increased risk of insulin resistance after adjusting for potential confounding factors. These findings indicate that even subtle alterations in thyroid function may impact metabolic health through effects on glucose homeostasis and peripheral insulin sensitivity. As METS-IR has demonstrated high accuracy in diagnosing insulin resistance and related cardiometabolic diseases, our results suggest that assessing thyroid function could serve as an early screening tool to aid in primary care settings. Considering the growing global burden of both thyroid disorders and insulin resistance-related conditions, continued efforts to elucidate their complex interplay remain vital for public health.

### Children and adolescents: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^6e3ed1ca]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Thyroid disease in youth with type 1 diabetes — screening and follow-up include screening for thyroid disease by measuring TSH, thyroid peroxidase and antithyroglobulin antibodies soon after diagnosis (B), measuring thyroid-stimulating hormone concentrations at diagnosis when clinically stable or soon after optimizing glycemia, and if normal, rechecking every 1–2 years or sooner when antibodies are positive or symptoms/signs suggest dysfunction, thyromegaly, abnormal growth, or unexplained glycemic variability (B). Autoimmune thyroid disease occurs in 17–30% of individuals with type 1 diabetes, and at diagnosis ~25% of children have thyroid autoantibodies; hyperthyroidism occurs in ~0.5% of people with type 1 diabetes. Thyroid function tests may be misleading at diagnosis; if slightly abnormal at diagnosis, they should be repeated soon after metabolic stability and achievement of glycemic goals. Subclinical hypothyroidism may be associated with increased risk of symptomatic hypoglycemia and dyslipidemia and reduced linear growth rate, while hyperthyroidism usually causes deterioration of glycemia.

### Exploring the causal relationship between GLP-1R agonists and diseases related to the thyroid and parathyroid: a mendelian randomization study [^eaf855f3]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonists are well-known for their benefits in managing obesity and diabetes. However, some studies indicate that they may elevate the risk of thyroid cancer. This study employed summary data-based Mendelian randomization (SMR) analysis, incorporating genetic data from GTEx V.8 and the UK Biobank, to assess how increased GLP-1R gene expression in thyroid and parathyroid tissues affects their functions. We found that increased expression of GLP-1R is a risk factor for hyperparathyroidism, but no causal relationship was found with thyroid dysfunction. Furthermore, we advise routine assessments of parathyroid function and hormone levels for patients on GLP-1R agonists.

### Clinical practice guidelines for hypothyroidism in adults: cosponsored by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and the American Thyroid Association [^9f921eca]. Endocrine Practice (2012). Medium credibility.

Diabetes mellitus — type 1 diabetes and thyroid dysfunction screening: Approximately 10% of patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus will develop chronic thyroiditis during their lifetime, which may lead to the insidious onset of subclinical hypothyroidism. Patients with diabetes should be examined for the presence and development of a goiter, and sensitive TSH measurements should be obtained at regular intervals in patients with type 1 diabetes, especially if a goiter develops or if evidence is found of other autoimmune disorders. In addition, postpartum thyroiditis will develop in up to 25% of women with type 1 diabetes.
