## Question

What nerve damaged in case of trochoear palse

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which cranial nerve is damaged in trochlear palsy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "trochlear" refers to in neuro-ophthalmology. Then, I should verify the numeric cranial nerve designation and its primary target muscle. Next, I will review the classic clinical phenotype to ensure it maps to that muscle's actions. After that, I should consider key anatomical vulnerabilities that corroborate why the nerve is prone to injury in certain settings. Finally, I will confirm that alternative explanations (like superior oblique myokymia) are not being conflated with palsy and then synthesize a concise answer.

> Let me first confirm the terminology, because precision matters here. "Trochlear" in this context refers to the trochlear nerve, which is cranial nerve IV, the fourth cranial nerve, and it is the only cranial nerve that exits dorsally from the brainstem and then decussates before innervating its target muscle, which is the superior oblique muscle [^113woZ39] [^1116YLLs].

> Wait, let me verify the muscle–nerve pairing so I don't jump to conclusions. Multiple authoritative sources state that the trochlear nerve exclusively innervates the superior oblique muscle, so damage to CN IV produces a superior oblique palsy with characteristic motility and torsional findings on exam [^1139b4FE] [^1151ERHf].

> I should confirm the clinical phenotype next to ensure internal consistency. In trochlear nerve palsy, patients typically have vertical diplopia that is worse on downgaze, hypertropia of the involved eye, and excyclotorsion, with a positive Bielschowsky head-tilt test; these features align with loss of superior oblique function and are the clinical signature of CN IV palsy rather than another cranial nerve problem [^1151ERHf] [^1139b4FE].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about mechanism without anchoring to anatomy. The trochlear nerve has the longest intracranial course of any cranial nerve, traverses near the tentorial edge, and is vulnerable to trauma, microvascular ischemia, compressive lesions, and iatrogenic injury; recognizing this anatomy helps explain why CN IV is frequently implicated in closed head injury and certain neurosurgical contexts, which fits the epidemiology and case literature of trochlear palsy [^113woZ39] [^1116YLLs] [^114RSWPM].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I should double-check that I'm not conflating superior oblique myokymia with palsy. Superior oblique myokymia reflects episodic hyperactivity or vascular compression phenomena of the trochlear nerve or its root entry zone and is mechanistically distinct from a paretic palsy; however, both entities implicate the trochlear nerve, reinforcing that the nerve in question is indeed CN IV [^111ypHXn] [^115i6xBk].

> Let me reconsider the core question to ensure I've answered it directly. The nerve damaged in trochlear palsy is the trochlear nerve, cranial nerve IV, which innervates the superior oblique muscle. Clinically, this produces a superior oblique palsy with vertical/torsional diplopia and the characteristic head-tilt findings on examination [^1139b4FE] [^1151ERHf].

---

The nerve damaged in trochlear palsy is the **trochlear nerve (cranial nerve IV)** [^113woZ39], which innervates the superior oblique muscle [^113woZ39]. Injury to this nerve causes **vertical and torsional diplopia** [^1139b4FE], worsened by downward gaze, and is often due to trauma, microvascular ischemia, or compressive lesions [^113DmsLk] [^114eyLqc]. Diagnosis is clinical, supported by the **three-step test** [^1151ERHf] and neuroimaging when indicated [^115B13hN]; management includes prisms, botulinum toxin, or strabismus surgery for persistent cases [^113U2RTh] [^111dyvwL].

## Anatomy and function of the trochlear nerve

- **Origin**: The trochlear nucleus lies in the dorsal midbrain, inferior to the oculomotor nucleus [^116CjesU].
- **Course**: Fibers exit dorsally, decussate in the superior medullary velum, and curve around the brainstem to the anterior surface; it then traverses the cavernous sinus and enters the orbit via the superior orbital fissure to innervate the superior oblique muscle [^113woZ39] [^1116YLLs].
- **Function**: The superior oblique depresses, intorts, and abducts the eye; its tendon passes through the trochlea, enabling these actions [^notfound].

---

## Clinical manifestations of trochlear nerve palsy

Trochlear nerve palsy presents with **characteristic ocular motility and alignment** deficits:

- **Diplopia**: Vertical and torsional, worsened on downward gaze (e.g. stairs, reading) [^notfound].
- **Hypertropia**: The affected eye is higher, with excyclotorsion [^notfound].
- **Compensatory head tilt**: Patients tilt away from the affected eye to reduce diplopia [^notfound].
- **Bielschowsky head tilt test**: Positive, with hypertropia increasing when the head is tilted toward the affected eye [^notfound].

## Etiology of trochlear nerve palsy

Trochlear nerve palsy has diverse etiologies; the most common are **trauma, microvascular ischemia, and compressive lesions**:

| **Etiology** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Trauma | Closed head injury, concussion, or surgical trauma are frequent causes [^113W4LDv] [^1151ERHf] |
| Microvascular ischemia | Diabetes, hypertension, and atherosclerosis can cause ischemic neuropathy [^114MYgrq] |
| Compressive lesions | Tumors (e.g. schwannoma, meningioma), aneurysms, or cavernous sinus lesions can compress the nerve [^114eyLqc] [^113GDjB5] |
| Congenital | Congenital superior oblique palsy may present in adulthood with decompensation [^1151ERHf] |
| Idiopathic | Cases without identifiable cause are common [^113DmsLk] |

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

Diagnosis is primarily clinical, supported by targeted testing and imaging:

- **Three-step test**: Parks-Bielschowsky test localizes vertical diplopia to the superior oblique [^1151ERHf].
- **Neuroimaging**: MRI is indicated for non-traumatic, progressive, or atypical cases to exclude compressive or inflammatory causes [^115B13hN] [^114eyLqc].
- **High-resolution MRI**: Can visualize the trochlear nerve and detect compressive lesions or congenital absence [^115bVd8S] [^1177wJ16] [^113GDjB5].

---

## Management and prognosis

Management depends on etiology, severity, and chronicity:

- **Conservative management**: Observation, prisms, and botulinum toxin for mild or acute cases [^111dyvwL].
- **Surgical management**: Strabismus surgery (e.g. inferior oblique weakening, superior oblique tucking) for persistent diplopia or large deviations [^111unfJT] [^1139b4FE].
- **Prognosis**: Traumatic and microvascular cases often recover spontaneously; congenital or compressive cases may persist and require surgery [^114MYgrq] [^1178QiQt].

---

## Conclusion

Trochlear palsy reflects **cranial nerve IV injury**, causing vertical/torsional diplopia and hypertropia from superior oblique weakness [^1151ERHf]. It is most often due to trauma, microvascular ischemia, or compression, with diagnosis grounded in clinical testing and selective imaging; treatment spans conservative measures and strabismus surgery for persistent deficits [^111fsMGv] [^1139b4FE].

### Association of superior oblique muscle volumes with the presence or absence of the trochlear nerve on high-resolution MR imaging in congenital superior oblique palsy [^117DoHQA]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2015). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Congenital superior oblique palsy is known to relate to trochlear nerve absence and a variable degree of superior oblique muscle hypoplasia. The purpose of this study was to determine whether superior oblique muscle volume predicts trochlear nerve absence in congenital superior oblique palsy.

Materials and Methods

A retrospective study of high-resolution MR imaging to evaluate the presence of the trochlear nerve and to measure superior oblique muscle areas and volumes with the image analysis tools of a PACS was performed in 128 consecutive patients with unilateral congenital superior oblique palsy and 34 age-matched healthy controls.

Results

Of the 128 patients with congenital superior oblique palsy, 88 had an ipsilateral trochlear nerve absence (absent group) and 40 had both trochlear nerves (present group). In patients with congenital superior oblique palsy, the paretic side superior oblique muscle volume was significantly smaller compared with the normal side only in the absent group (P < .001). The left and right side superior oblique muscle volumes were not significantly different in controls (P = 0.750), and the paretic and normal side superior oblique muscle volumes were not significantly different in the present group (P = 0.536). The cutoff value of the paretic/normal side superior oblique muscle volume ratio for diagnosing trochlear nerve absence was ≤ 0.75 (sensitivity 98.9%, specificity 95.0%) in patients with congenital superior oblique palsy.

Conclusions

The ratio of paretic/normal side superior oblique muscle area and volume has an excellent predictability in diagnosing trochlear nerve absence in congenital superior oblique palsy.

### Combined Brown syndrome and superior oblique palsy without a trochlear nerve: case report [^1177htNY]. BMC Ophthalmology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Congenital Brown syndrome is characterized by limited elevation particularly during adduction. The pathogenesis of congenital Brown syndrome is still controversial.

Case presentation

A 6-year-old boy had been tilting his head to the left since infancy. He showed right hypertropia (RHT) of 2 prism diopters (Δ) in the primary position. He showed RHT 6Δ in right gaze, RHT 2Δ in left gaze, RHT 12Δ in right head tilt, and orthotropia in left head tilt. The right eye showed limitation of elevation and depression on adduction, and the left eye showed overdepression on adduction. MR images showed an absent right trochlear nerve with a hypoplastic ipsilateral superior oblique muscle.

Conclusions

Congenital Brown syndrome may be associated with an absent trochlear nerve and hypoplastic superior oblique muscle suggesting an etiologic mechanism of congenital cranial dysinnervation disorder.

### Correlations between the clinical characteristics of diabetic trochlear nerve palsy and diplopia severity [^116a9n5i]. BMC Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Diabetic trochlear nerve palsy, as a type of diabetic peripheral neuropathy, occurs after middle age and more common in males. The severity of diplopia differs between the mid age and old age patients. It also shows no preference in the distribution of unilateral involved eye, with no statistical difference in the observed indicators between the left and right eyes. Furthermore, the duration of diabetes is an independent risk factor affecting the severity of diplopia. The longer the duration of diabetes, the more severe the diplopia in patients. In contrast, there is no significant correlation between the severity of diplopia and, age, time of symptom onset, or HbA1c level. Overall, this study, based on the computerized diplopia test results, quantitively evaluated the severity of diplopia and revealed the clinical features of diabetic trochlear nerve palsy, which may provide a reference for subsequent clinical treatment.

### Adult strabismus preferred practice pattern ® [^1151ERHf]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Superior oblique palsy (SOP) — disease definition, presentation, differential features, and common causes are outlined as follows: SOP is due to partial or complete paralysis of the 4th cranial nerve (trochlear nerve), producing a motility disturbance with vertical, torsional, and to a lesser degree horizontal incomitance; both congenital and acquired forms exist, with the presumed congenital type sometimes first presenting in adulthood. Patients may show hypertropia of the involved eye with compensatory head tilt and report diplopia, asthenopia, and/or anomalous head posture. Decompensated congenital SOP can include facial asymmetry with a shorter maxilla on the side opposite the SOP, and some chronic vertical deviations consistent with SOP lack a decreased superior oblique muscle belly on neuroimaging, sometimes showing only compartmental atrophy; these may be referred to as presumed SOP or masquerading SOP. Non-inflammatory or post-inflammatory TED with unilateral or bilaterally asymmetric inferior rectus enlargement can present with a three-step test mimicking SOP. Head trauma (including concussion) is among the most common identifiable causes of unilateral or bilateral acquired SOP, though isolated trochlear schwannomas and giant cell arteritis are extremely rare causes. Skew deviation can resemble SOP and is more frequently associated with less benign etiology and more often warrants neuroimaging.

### Superior oblique myokymia caused by vascular compression in the peripheral trochlear nerve: a case report [^111ypHXn]. Neurosurgery Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

We report a case of SOM caused by neurovascular conflict in the peripheral trochlear nerve that was completely cured after MVD. Bringewaldfirst suggested that SOM may result from vascular compression of the trochlear nerve. Only 7 cases of SOM treated with MVD have been reported since Samiipioneered MVD surgery. All cases were attributed to compression at the REZ of the trochlear nerve.-

Similar to vascular facial nerve compression that causes hemifacial spasms, vascular compression of the REZ and peripheral trochlear nerve may cause SOM. Both conditions exhibit progressive episodic symptoms and can be cured by MVD. A comparable mechanism, involving pressure-induced demyelination and the ectopic generation of ephaptic impulse transmissions along the affected nerve, is likely responsible for both conditions.

SOM, like other cranial neuropathies, may not always be associated with neurovascular compression. Symptom resolution after MVD may result not only from decompressing the nerve but also from manipulation during surgery. The 9-month trochlear nerve palsy observed in this case could reflect temporary nerve dysfunction during the recovery process. Even in the absence of clear imaging evidence of compression, surgery may still be beneficial when clinical symptoms strongly suggest SOM. Considering these possibilities helps to deepen our understanding of SOM's pathophysiology and treatment.

Various pharmacological treatments have been used for SOM, though their effectiveness varies. Patients are commonly prescribed anticonvulsants or eye drops for symptomatic relief; however, these approaches often provide limited benefit. Brazis et aldocumented the resolution of oscillopsia in 4 cases after a combination of tenectomy and inferior oblique myectomy. Although tenotomy and tenectomy of the superior oblique tendon are frequently used in SOM management, they pose a risk of iatrogenic superior oblique palsy, which typically leads to weakening of the ipsilateral inferior oblique muscle. MVD is the sole definitive solution for SOM, with remarkably low potential risks, such as death or stroke, when performed by skilled neurosurgeons.

Six studies,- have documented the full resolution of SOM and improved functioning after MVD. Of the 8 reported patients with this condition, including our patient, 5 experienced temporary trochlear nerve palsy, which resolved within 2 weeks to 9 months after MVD. Recurrence has not been reported (Table).

### Prognostic factors for successful surgical outcomes in trochlear nerve palsy: a retrospective study and literature review [^1139b4FE]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The trochlear cranial nerve exclusively supplies the superior oblique muscle. Isolated or unilateral weakness in this muscle typically results in hypertropia, whereas bilateral weakness often causes torsional diplopia. Population-based studies on trochlear nerve palsy report an incidence rate of approximately 3.74–5.73 per 100,000 cases annually. Common etiologies include congenital, presumed vascular, compressive, idiopathic causes, and postinfectious etiology, with varying distributions observed across studies. Notably, congenital forms are the most frequently identified, accounting for 49%–76.7% of cases. However, some case series suggest a predominance of acquired causes in specific cohorts.

The recovery rate of trochlear nerve palsy varies substantially, with estimates ranging from 24.6% to 82.6%. Partial recovery lowered the quality of life, resulting in diplopia, compensatory head posture, and visual issues. The treatment options for patients with partial or nonrecovery include conservative approaches, such as patching, prisms, eyeglasses, and surgical interventions. Surgical procedures typically address vertical misalignment and often involve inferior oblique weakening, superior oblique tucking, or vertical rectus muscle weakening, which can be performed individually or in combination based on the measured deviation. Conversely, individualized surgical planning is essential for managing torsional diplopia. The reported success rates of surgery for trochlear nerve palsy range from 61.9% to 100%, with outcomes varying based on the surgical technique employed and the criteria used to define success. Inferior oblique myectomy, inferior oblique anterior transposition, and superior oblique tucking achieve success rates of 61.9%–94.7%,89%–100%, and 85.19%, respectively. However, inferior oblique recession, a less commonly performed technique, has received limited attention in the literature, with a reported success rate of 84.2% in one study. The lack of comprehensive data on inferior oblique recession limits direct comparisons with other techniques. Additionally, a study conducted in Thailand reported an overall surgical success rate of 82.75%. However, specific procedures were not delineated. This highlights the need for further research on surgical outcomes in diverse populations, particularly within Southeast Asia, to bridge the existing knowledge gaps.

### Retrospective analysis of factors related to the long-term recovery of third, fourth, and sixth cranial nerve palsy with etiologies and clinical course in a tertiary hospital [^116b5Bkj]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

According to the etiology of cranial nerve palsy, microvascular had a good recovery rate, whereas compressive lesions, especially tumors, had the worst prognosis in the previous studies. Our results support the good recovery in ischemic cases, which had a > 50% chance of recovery. In addition, the best prognosis was observed for the inflammatory cause of trochlear nerve palsy, among other reasons, and the traumatic cause had the most remarkable recovery rate in abducens nerve palsy. Among the groups, the two proportions with a traumatic cause in abducens nerve palsy had a better prognosis than those with a trochlear nerve cause. In comparison, idiopathic etiology was associated with a better prognosis in trochlear nerve palsy than others.

With regard to underlying conditions, controversy exists as to whether diabetes mellitus and hypertension are associated with cranial nerve palsy. Several studies have supported that these underlying conditions are risk factors of acquired nerve palsies. Despite the increased risks, they were not associated with outcomes. Our study demonstrated no correlation between the rate of cranial nerve palsy recovery and diabetes and hypertension.

Only a few studies identified factors associated with good prognosis. Park et alretrospectively reviewed 206 subjects with acquired cranial third, fourth, and sixth palsy from July 1998 to February 2005 at Seoul National University Hospital. They found that sixth cranial nerve palsy was affected most frequently in 52.4% of cases. Vascular disease was the most common etiology at 31.1%, whereas 85.2% of patients showed overall (at least partial) recovery and 67.6% complete recovery. In the study, multivariate logistic regression indicated that minor initial ocular deviation and treatable etiologies were associated with good recovery. The objective measurement of ocular deviation was key in determining recovery from palsy, as in our research.

Kim et alretrospectively reported on 153 patients diagnosed with paralytic strabismus, showing that vascular-related causes were the most common at 54.9%. The idiopathic cause had the best recovery rate of 50% within 3 months, and the Cox proportional hazard analysis revealed a significant association between baseline prism diopter and recovery rate.

### Isolated contralateral abducens palsy in direct carotid-cavernous fistula [^114pe93E]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

Post-traumatic direct carotid-cavernous fistulas may develop in patients with a closed head injury. The classical presentation is the Dandy's triad-chemosis, pulsatile proptosis and orbital bruit. Associated findings may include orbital pain, dilated episcleral corkscrew vessels, vision deficit and cranial nerve palsies. Cranial nerves-oculomotor (III), trochlear (IV), ophthalmic (V1), and maxillary (V2) divisions of trigeminal and the abducens (VI) lie in close association of the cavernous sinus. Abducens nerve (VI) lies close to the intracavernous internal carotid artery, within the substance of the sinus and is hence easily susceptible to vascular insult. The two sinuses connect across the midline and communicate freely with each other. Back pressure changes can present with the same sided or bilateral cranial nerve palsies. We report a rare association of a long-standing left-sided carotid-cavernous fistula with right eye abduction deficit and contralateral abducens palsy.

### Trochlear nerve schwannoma with repeated intratumoral hemorrhage [^115ksyCk]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Trochlear nerve schwannoma is extremely rare, with only 35 pathologically confirmed patients being reported in the literature. Here, the authors report a patient of trochlear nerve schwannoma in the prepontine cistern manifesting as facial pain and double vision and presenting the image characteristics of repeated intratumoral hemorrhage, which has never been reported in the literature. Total tumor along with a portion of the trochlear nerve was removed by using a retrosigmoid approach. Facial pain disappeared after operation, and the diplopia remained. Follow-up studies have shown no tumor recurrence for 2 years and the simultaneous alleviation of diplopia. Information regarding the clinical presentation, radiological features and surgical outcomes of trochlear nerve schwannoma are discussed and reviewed in the paper.

### The link between idiopathic intracranial hypertension, fibromyalgia, and chronic fatigue syndrome: exploration of a shared pathophysiology [^111uUK1t]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Cranial nerve involvement

It has been shown that the perineural spaces of several cranial nerves including the olfactory, optic, trigeminal, and auditory nerves show multiple lymphatic pathways of CSF drainage toward the retropharyngeal and cervical lymph nodes.

When CSP increases, CSF is forced into the cranial nerve root sheaths. This might compromise the blood supply or cause mechanical pressure on the neurons or axons during their intracranial course.

The olfactory nerve (I)

Patients with IICH often show decreased olfactory bulb volumesand impaired olfactory function. These findings have also been reported for patients with FM. It is most likely that these symptoms are due to increased pressure compromising the blood supply and damaging the olfactory nerve cell bodies.

The optic nerve (II)

In IICH, the optic nerve diameter may be increased as the pressure of the CSF dilates the nerve sheath. Additionally, due to the increased pressure, the optic nerve fibers inside may be damaged. Consequently, even in the absence of papilledema, peripheral visual field defects may occur.

Visual field defects have been detected in patients with FM, which might indicate that the nerve root fibers of the optic nerve are damaged by the increased pressure.

Figure 2 shows T2-weighted sagittal MRI images of a dilated optic nerve in a 46-year-old female patient with unexplained widespread pain. She was later diagnosed with IICH because a lumbar puncture revealed an OP of 23 cm H₂O, and visual field defects were detected. Evacuation of 20 mL of CSF dramatically improved her symptoms during a period of 2 or 3 days.

The oculomotor nerve (III), trochlear nerve (IV), and abducens nerve (VI)

The third, fourth, and sixth cranial nerves control the motor function of the eye muscles. In IICH, compression of these nerves may cause oculomotor weakness, and patients present with double vision and, in severe cases, even oculomotor palsy. In patients with FM and CFS, double vision has been reported, and in patients with CFS, eye motility dysfunction has been observed.

### Etiological distribution of isolated oculomotor nerve palsy: analysis of 633 patients and literature review [^112esPCS]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Our patients with isolated oculomotor nerve palsy more frequently visited the emergency department first than those with isolated trochlear or abducens nerve palsy (42.5% vs. 17.8% vs. 30.1%, Figure 6b). This may be explained by a higher proportion of etiologies causing acute or subacute onset of diplopia such as vascular anomalies (17.4% vs. 1.3% vs. 10.2%) and inflammation (12.5% vs. 1.5% vs. 9.4%).

Limitation

In this study, the etiology in 5.8% (39/672) of the patients initially recruited could not be determined due to an incomplete evaluation. This may have affected the relative proportion of etiologies in our patients with isolated oculomotor nerve palsy. Even though the distribution of patients with incomplete evaluation was similar across the age groups, the men‐to‐women ratio was higher in these patients than in those finally included for analyses (1.8 vs. 1.3). This selection bias may have affected the overall distribution of etiology and the sex ratio. Since this is a retrospective study performed in a single referral‐based hospital, the results may have differed from those observed in the general population. Finally, the comorbidities, details of the treatments and prognosis were not analyzed, which should be the subjects of future studies.

### Acute onset binocular diplopia: a retrospective observational study of 100 consecutive cases managed at a tertiary eye centre in Saudi Arabia [^113Dm5EA]. Eye (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the demography, aetiology and clinical course of acute onset binocular diplopia (AOBD) in patients presented as emergency and managed at the neuroophthalmology clinic of a tertiary eye care centre in Saudi Arabia.

Patients and Methods

A retrospective review of the medical records of 100 consecutive patients who attended the emergency department of Dhahran Eye Specialist Hospital with isolated, AOBD. The exclusion criteria were: (a) monocular diplopia, (b) binocular diplopia accompanied with neurological deficits other than ocular muscles dysfunction and (c) thyroid eye disease. All patients were followed until resolution of the diplopia or onward referral to another specialty for further management.

Results

Male:female ratio was 2:1. Median age of the cohort was 56 years (range 18–90 years). Associated nerve palsy included: abducens nerve (n = 57 patients), oculomotor (n = 32 patients) and trochlear nerve (n = 3 patients). Microvascular ischaemia and ocular myasthenia gravis were two most common pathogenic mechanisms. AOBD resolved spontaneously in 98% of patients.

Conclusion

AOBD, though an alarming and distressing condition, carries reassuringly good prognosis in majority of patients. High risk factors for vascular disease in Middle-Eastern population are reflected in microvascular aetiology as the major cause.

### Percutaneous radiofrequency treatment of the gasserian ganglion for trigeminal neuralgia complicated by trochlear nerve palsy: a case report [^1122zUTh]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, trochlear nerve palsy resulting in diplopia is a rare, generally transient complication of percutaneous radiofrequency treatment of the gasserian ganglion. Preprocedural imaging is essential for finding the origin of TN and contributes to risk assessment when planning invasive treatment techniques, while awake stimulation and careful needle maneuvering under fluoroscopic guidance are needed for correct application of RF-G.

### Prognostic factors for successful surgical outcomes in trochlear nerve palsy: a retrospective study and literature review [^117MCVFu]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Despite extensive reporting on surgical outcomes, a comprehensive understanding of the prognostic factors influencing success remains elusive. Previous studies identified amblyopia, older age, and larger vertical deviations, as predictors of the need for reoperation. Thus, identifying additional factors is essential for guiding clinical decision-making and improving patient care. This report examined the types of surgical procedures performed, their long-term success rates, and the factors influencing favorable outcomes in trochlear nerve palsy treatment in a tertiary hospital setting.

Fig. 2
Left trochlear nerve palsy in computerized diplopia test (α = horizontal deviation, β = vertical deviation; Red spots = 9 primary gaze positions, Blue rectangles = the red spots actually seen by patients on the screen. Gaze positions from 1 to 9 = Top left, Up, Top right, Left, Primary, Right, Bottom left, Down and Bottom right)

Fig. 3
Left trochlear nerve palsy in Hess screen test (L-Left, R-Right; SR = Superior Rectus, IO = Inferior Oblique, LR = Lateral Rectus, MR = Medial Rectus, IR = Inferior Rectus, SO = Superior Oblique)

As shown in Fig. 2, the physician utilizes diffusion charts to ascertain the involved eye. When we compare the bilateral shape with 9 blue rectangles connected, the bigger one is the diffusion chart, and the involved eye is ascertained. The left eye's diplopia chart (9 connected blue rectangles) shows a down-medial diplopia deviation tendency compared to the 9 connected red spots, which indicates paralysis of the left superior oblique muscle. As shown in Fig. 2, the maximum vertical diplopia angle value was measured 12 in the left 7th gaze position. On the basis of the principles of computerized diplopia tests, unilateral trochlear nerve palsy patients present a maximum vertical deviation at the (7th) bottom left position of the left eye or the (9th) bottom right position of the right eye. Both the 7th gaze position in left eye and the 9th gaze position in right eye are inferior nasal gaze positions, which is consistent with the orientation of diplopia in clinical. Therefore, the maximum value of vertical deviation recorded in the 7th (left eye involved) or the 9th gaze position (right eye involved) can be used to evaluate the severity of trochlear nerve palsy.

### Prognostic factors for successful surgical outcomes in trochlear nerve palsy: a retrospective study and literature review [^115aAWpz]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Similarly, good preoperative stereopsis (≤ 140 arcseconds) was associated with favorable postoperative ocular alignment 1 year after surgery. Strong preoperative binocular vision may enhance fusional amplitude in cases of residual hypertropia, particularly in congenital trochlear nerve palsy, facilitating long-term ocular stability. However, our study did not assess distant stereopsis, which may also affect surgical outcomes. Future research should explore the relationship between distant stereopsis and postoperative alignment to refine patient selection criteria and optimize long-term success.

I found that inferior oblique myectomy was associated with favorable long-term surgical outcomes; however, inferior oblique recession produced worse outcomes in our cohort. Previous studies found that inferior oblique anterior transposition was more effective than myectomy; however, it carries a risk of inducing antielevation syndrome. Although less common, inferior oblique recession has also shown positive outcomes in some studies. To the best of my knowledge, this was the first study that compared these three techniques and concluded that inferior oblique myectomy is the most effective procedure potentially, because of the subjective nature of quantifying inferior oblique overaction, which can lead to inaccuracies when planning for recession, exacerbating the weakening effects of the recession and contributing to suboptimal outcomes. Conversely, inferior oblique myectomy and anterior transposition rely less on precise measurements of overaction, explaining their more consistent success as surgical correction techniques.

Knapp classification was formerly categorized as a type of superior oblique muscle palsy. Compared to types 3 and 4, type 1 was the most prevalent and associated with the best surgical outcomes. Type 1 subjects had the worst hypertropia when examining the field of action of the inferior oblique muscle, reflecting inferior oblique overaction. These patients could have benefited from the inferior oblique muscle weakening procedure. Type 3 and 4 patients demonstrated significantly superior oblique muscle underaction, necessitating the superior oblique muscle strengthening procedure. Consequently, these patients are more likely to experience poor outcomes.

A literature review was conducted using the PubMed database to evaluate recent trochlear nerve palsy surgery data. Search terms included "trochlear nerve palsy", "fourth nerve palsy", "surgery", and "success". Table 4 summarizes the surgical techniques and outcomes from studies published since 2016. Only studies examining inferior oblique weakening procedures were included.

### The spectrum and differential diagnosis of acquired ocular motor nerve palsies: a clinical study of 502 patients [^114eyLqc]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Ocular motor nerve palsies (OMNP) frequently cause patients to present in an emergency room. In the following study, we report the differential diagnosis of OMNP by use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and CSF examination as a standard.

Method

We performed a data analysis of N = 502 patients who presented with oculomotor, trochlear, and/or abducens nerve palsy in the emergency room of the Department of Neurology, University of Ulm, between January 2006 and December 2019. We report clinical and MRI scan findings in all patients; furthermore, the CSF of 398 patients has been analysed.

Results

Abducens nerve palsies were most common (45%), followed by palsies of the oculomotor (31%) (CNP III) and trochlear nerve (15%). Multiple OMNPs were seen in 9% of our cohort. The most common causes included inflammations (32.7%), space-occupying lesions, such as aneurysms or neoplasms (17.3%), diabetes mellitus (13.3%), and brainstem infarctions (11%). Still 23.4% of the patients could not be assigned to any specific cause after differential diagnostic procedures and were described as idiopathic. One of three patients with an inflammation and 39% of the patients with space-occupying lesions showed additional cranial nerve deficits.

Conclusion

Inflammation and space-occupying processes were the most frequent causes of OMNP, although brainstem infarctions also play a significant role, in particular in CNP III. The presence of additional CNPs increases the probability of an inflammatory or space-occupying cause.

### Retrospective analysis of factors related to the long-term recovery of third, fourth, and sixth cranial nerve palsy with etiologies and clinical course in a tertiary hospital [^116xkzCL]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Cranial nerves 3, 4, and 6 supply extraocular muscle movement. Their pathology affects both the motor and autonomic nervous systems. In an analysis of existing research on the long-term outcomes of third, fourth, and sixth cranial nerve palsy, we found a diverse landscape of research findings.

Our data corroborates those of previous studies, indicating that abducens nerve palsy is the most frequently encountered among the three nerves, whereas trochlear nerve palsy exhibits a lower prevalence. However, recently reported incidence rates in the Korean population present a different perspective, with trochlear nerve palsy being the most common and oculomotor nerve palsy the least common. These regional disparities underscore the significance of geographic factors in the distribution of cranial nerve palsies and emphasize the need for clinical evaluations and research to consider such variations.

We conducted a literature review on the etiologies of oculomotor, trochlear, and abducens nerve palsy, categorized according to the most extensive literature reviews of 4278 subjects from the previous study(Table 4). The etiologies varied across the studies for many reasons. First, the evolution in investigation lessens the undetermined etiology. Second, studies in different regions may reflect other disease distributions. Finally, even at the same institution, different data collection times led to various etiologies, implying an actual change.

Table 4
Compared Etiologies of Isolated Third, Fourth, and Sixth Cranial Nerve Palsy (%)

Our data showed that the overall recovery rate was 38.5%, which is comparable with previous reports (range, 38–80%). The recovery rate varied across studies due to data collection methods. Moreover, the rate depended on the criteria used for recovery measurement. Some studies used follow-up letters or telephone calls to collect data, which might not accurately reflect total recovery. In our research, ophthalmologists evaluated all patients, asked for symptoms, and measured ocular deviation at every visit, which might have resulted in excellent reliability regarding accurate recovery.

II cranial nerve - Optic nerve

Optic nerve represents an extension of central nervous system and is myelinated by oligodendrocytes. Optic nerve emerges from the posterior pole of the ocular globe. It is approximately 50 mm in length, divided in four segments: intraocular (1 mm), intraorbital (25 mm), intracanalicular (9 mm), and prechiasmatic (16 mm). The nerve joins the contralateral to form the optic chiasma, where the nasal fibers from each nerve decussate, while the temporal fibers not. From the optic chiasm, optic tract courses posteriorly along the cerebral peduncles and synapses at the lateral geniculate nuclei. From the lateral geniculate body, optic radiation reaches the primary visual cortex in the occipital lobe (Brodmann area 17) (Fig. 5).

Fig. 5
Schematic drawing of the optic and oculomotors nerves

III cranial nerve - Oculomotor nerve

The oculomotor nerve has a somatic motor function of most ocular estrinsic muscles (inferior, superior, middle rectus, inferior oblique, and levator palpebrae superior muscles) and a parasympathetic function (ciliaris and sphincter pupillae muscles). Somatic motor fibers of oculomotor originate from the nuclear complex located in the midbrain at the level of the superior colliculi, ventral to the cerebral aqueduct and the periaqueductal gray matter. The parasympathetic fibers arise in the Edinger-Westphal nucleus, situated dorsally to the oculomotor nuclear complex. The nerve emerges from the interpeduncular cistern running through the perimesencephalic cistern, superiorly to the posterior cerebral artery (PCA) and inferiorly to the superior cerebellar artery (SCA). Successively, the nerve enters in the cavernous sinus where is the most superior nerve, to reach the orbit through the superior orbital fissure (Fig. 5).

IV cranial nerve - Trochlear nerve

The trochlear nerve innervates only the superior oblique muscle. It is the unique nerve with a root zone arising from the posterior brainstem where its nucleus lies. After exiting the pons, the nerve curves over the superior cerebellar peduncle and then runs between the SCA and the PCA. Successively, it runs along the free margin of the tentorium and then enters the cavernous sinus, inferior to the III nerve and superior to the ophthalmic division of the V nerve. Passing the cavernous sinus, the trochlear nerve enters the orbit through the superior orbital fissure (Fig. 5).

### Correlations between the clinical characteristics of diabetic trochlear nerve palsy and diplopia severity [^112yhMzu]. BMC Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

The Ocular Motor Nerve Palsy Scale was designed by LY Zhou to score the severity of diplopia. In trochlear nerve palsy patients, the max angle of vertical diplopia was multiplied by 3 before scoring and ranked from 0 to 4 levels. Score 0 = no diplopia, with a maximum deviation angle of less than 5° in the direction of paralysis; 1 = occasional diplopia, with a maximum deviation angle between 5° and 10° (including 5°) in the paralysis direction; 2 = diplopia, with a maximum deviation angle between 10° and 15° (including 10°) in the paralysis direction; 3 = diplopia, with a maximum deviation angle between 15° and 20° (including 15°) in the paralysis direction; 4 = diplopia, with a maximum deviation angle of 20° or more in the paralysis direction.

All the statistical analyses were performed via SPSS Statistics (software version 27.0; IBM Corporation, Armonk, USA). The Mann-Whitney U test was used to analyze gender, age, and involved eyes. Continuous variables are presented as the means ± standard deviations. Chi-square test was conducted to compare categorical variables. The Pearson Chi-squared test was used to analyze the correlation between the clinical indicators and the severity of diplopia. Ordered logistic regression analysis was used to investigate the factors influencing the severity of diplopia. A P value of < 0.05 was considered significant.

### Central ocular motor disorders, including gaze palsy and nystagmus [^111PowPY]. Journal of Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Ocular motor disturbances

Topographically and anatomically, ocular motor disturbances can be classified as either peripheral or central. Peripheral forms affect the six outer and/or two inner ocular muscles or the oculomotor nerve, trochlear nerve or abducens nerve. Patients with peripheral ocular motor disturbances often complain of diplopia, which intensifies in the direction of the paretic muscle/nerve. Peripheral ocular motor disturbances usually affect one eye only (important exceptions include myasthenia gravis, chronic progressive, external ophthalmoplegia).

Central forms usually affect both eyes. These are manifestations of functional impairments of the brainstem (Fig. 7), cerebellum, or (rarely) other higher level centers. Patients with central ocular motor disturbances may report unclear or blurred vision. If the ocular motor disturbance is slowly progressive, such as in PSP, cerebellar degeneration or NP-C, it may remain undetected for a long time. Usually, the extent of the subjective impairments also depends on how acutely the impairments develop.

### Prognostic factors for successful surgical outcomes in trochlear nerve palsy: a retrospective study and literature review [^1156RbPZ]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Materials and Methods

Study Participants

This retrospective study collected data from individuals with strabismus. Electronic data was retrospect from April 1, 2012, to July 31, 2024. I used the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) codes 15.1–15.9 to find strabismus procedures, matching with ICD-10 code H491 for trochlear nerve palsy. I collected general data, including age, sex, onset duration, diagnosis, stereopsis, ocular version, preoperative angle, and surgery outcomes during the following period.

Inclusion criteria were individuals who had trochlear nerve palsy and received strabismus surgeries for the first time in only one cyclovertical muscle with complete data collected. Participants must be postoperatively followed and receive the examination at least four times annually. The exclusion criteria were individuals who had trochlear nerve palsies with previous surgery and incomplete data.

A total of 92 cases received surgical treatment, 20 of which were excluded due to missing data. Hence, this study included the remaining 72 cases. Figure 1 shows the flowchart of participant recruitment.

Figure 1
Flowchart of participant recruitment.

Disease Definition

Trochlear nerve palsy is a trochlear nerve weakness that causes vertical diplopia with or without excyclotorsional symptoms. Congenital cases have typical features, including facial asymmetry, large vertical fusional amplitude, and absence of torsional diplopia.

### Superior oblique myokymia caused by vascular compression in the peripheral trochlear nerve: a case report [^115i6xBk]. Neurosurgery Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

First described by Hoyt and Keane in 1970, superior oblique myokymia (SOM) is a condition characterized by episodic torsional oscillations of the eye, resulting from acquired dysfunction in the innervation of the superior oblique muscle. Although its risk factors remain unidentified, the symptoms can range from mild to severely debilitating, significantly affecting daily life. - SOM results from vascular compression of the trochlear nerve root at its exit zone. Microvascular decompression (MVD) for treating SOM was developed by Samii et al in 1998. However, MVD use has been documented in only 7 cases of SOM, all due to compression at the root exit zone (REZ) of the trochlear nerve.-

We performed the first MVD in a patient with SOM caused by vascular compression of the peripheral trochlear nerve using a lateral supracerebellar infratentorial approach. Postoperatively, the patient exhibited immediate and complete resolution of symptoms without recurrence during a 22-month follow-up period. In this study, we describe the neurovascular conflict between preoperative MRI and intraoperative findings while highlighting the successful outcome of the surgery. This report is compliant with the CARE Guideline for a case report.

### Retrospective analysis of factors related to the long-term recovery of third, fourth, and sixth cranial nerve palsy with etiologies and clinical course in a tertiary hospital [^112M4WsA]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

Understanding the natural progression of these conditions is vital for guiding clinical decisions and providing appropriate patient care. However, there is a current gap in the literature on the prognostic factors that affect the recovery rate. Investigating these factors allows for a comprehensive assessment of patient outcomes and provides valuable insights into optimizing management strategies for these neuro-ophthalmologic conditions.

In this study, we aim to report the etiologies, clinical courses, and factors associated with good prognosis in a tertiary referral hospital. Furthermore, we conducted a literature review to compare our study with previous reports.

### The review of ophthalmic symptoms in COVID-19 [^111fSq52]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

Cranial Nerve Palsy

Due to COVID-19, paralysis of the third, fourth, sixth and seventh cranial nerves has been observed. They may occur as primary, isolated paralysis, but also in the context of broader conditions such as Miller Fisher syndrome, Guillain-Barré syndrome or myasthenia gravis.

Cases of isolated oculomotor nerve palsy have been reported, both with and without pupillary involvement. Similarly, isolated abducens nerve palsy has been reported associated with COVID-19. There are also known cases of unilateral trochlear nerve palsy with contralateral tonic pupil, as well as bilateral palsy of this nerve in the course of cerebral vasculitis associated with COVID-19.

Cases of isolated facial nerve palsy associated with COVID-19 have also been reported. Lima et al also described palsy of the VII nerve coexisting with ipsilateral VI nerve palsy.

Drugs such as hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, corticosteroids, and intravenous immunoglobulins have been used in treatment of COVID-19-related cranial neuropathies. However, there is no clear data on the benefits of the treatment. These neuropathies also appear in the context of Miller Fisher and Guillain-Barré syndrome. Dinkin et al described a patient with COVID-19 in whom the use of intravenous immunoglobulins led to partial improvement of deficits associated with presumed Miller Fisher syndrome. Gutiérrez-Ortiz et al reported a similar case with Miller Fisher syndrome in which most of the deficits resolved after intravenous infusion of immunoglobulins. Sansone et al showed that among patients with Guillain-Barré syndrome associated with SARS-CoV-2, the first neurological symptoms appeared approximately 10 days after the onset of SARS-CoV-2 symptoms.

Additionally, it has been reported that COVID-19 may be responsible for the emergence of new cases of myasthenia gravis. Restivo et al described in detail three patients whose myasthenic symptoms appeared 4–7 days after the initial symptoms of COVID-19.

### Cavernous malformation of the trochlear nerve: case report and review of the literature on cranial nerve cavernomas [^1178QiQt]. Neurosurgery (2011). Low credibility.

Background and Importance

Cavernous malformations (CMs) arising intrinsically to the cisternal segment of the trochlear nerve are extremely rare. This case of a trochlear nerve cavernous angioma is the third to be reported in the neurosurgical literature and the first to be resected by a middle fossa approach.

Clinical Presentation

The authors present a case of a 31-year-old woman with progressive left-sided headache and left hemisensory symptoms, whose magnetic resonance imaging showed a solid enhancing tumor in the left ambient cistern at the level of the midbrain-pontine junction causing significant brainstem compression. Intraoperatively, a left trochlear nerve cavernous angioma circumferentially enveloping the nerve was visualized. The angioma was microsurgically resected by a middle fossa approach under frameless stereotactic guidance. Gross total resection of the intrinsic trochlear nerve lesion was achieved, although the trochlear nerve could not be preserved intact.

Conclusion

CMs should be considered in a possible differential diagnosis of cisternal trochlear nerve tumors. Surgical resection remains the standard of care, and is indicated for relief of compressive symptoms and prevention of future bleeds. Postoperative diplopia often persists; however, resolution of diplopia reported in the literature can be attributed to either regeneration after direct surgical repair of the sacrificed nerve or a spontaneous adaptation over time.

### Percutaneous radiofrequency treatment of the gasserian ganglion for trigeminal neuralgia complicated by trochlear nerve palsy: a case report [^114H4yFj]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Large, well-established trials on outcome after treatment for TN are few. As such, most data on complication risk are derived from a select number of decades old cohort studies. The incidence of CN paralysis after RF-G is reported to be between 0.29% and 7.7%, with more recent studies citing numbers at the lower end of this range. These studies are regularly referenced in guidelines, but mention of postprocedural diplopia is mostly lacking. Although the incidence of diplopia after RF-G remains unclear, clinical experience confirms that occurrence of CN palsy after RF-G is exceedingly rare.

A handful of case reports concerning CN palsy after treatment for TN have been published over the last decennia. Treatment modalities for these patients span all procedures, except for gamma-knife surgery. Multiple authors report isolated transient CN4 or CN6 palsy after (repeated) percutaneous balloon compression, RF-G, or MVD. One study documents a patient with permanent trochlear nerve damage and corresponding diplopia after RF-G. Subarachnoid hemorrhage after attempted RF-G, followed by — among other symptoms — multiple bilateral CN paralysis, has also been reported.

### Persistent diplopia and superior oblique muscle dysfunction following dissection of the orbital periosteum in cranial base surgery [^113W4LDv]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2013). Low credibility.

Background/Aims

Persistent diplopia secondary to a fourth cranial nerve palsy is poorly documented after open cranial base surgery.

Methods

Six cases of fourth cranial nerve palsy after cranial base surgery were drawn from the Neuro-Ophthalmology and Head and Neck Surgery Clinics at the University of Michigan from 2004 to 2012.

Results

Six patients developed diplopia and ocular misalignment in a pattern suggestive of superior oblique palsy following dissection of the medial orbital periosteum as part of a surgical approach to the anterior cranial base. Among the four patients in whom follow-up examination was available, the misalignment improved spontaneously in three patients and was stable in the fourth patient, but did not completely resolve in any patient.

Conclusions

This sparsely documented phenomenon is likely caused by dysfunction of the superior oblique muscle, possibly the result of malposition of the trochlea after spontaneous reattachment of the periosteum. Special factors such as invasive tumours, repeated surgeries of this nature, prior radiation, or chemical cementing material that adversely affects wound healing may be contributory.

### Isolated oculomotor nerve palsy from minor head trauma [^117GBNgy]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Isolated third cranial nerve palsies in head trauma patients can be the result of direct or indirect damage to the oculomotor nerve. They are usually associated with severe head trauma. We reported a case of isolated oculomotor nerve palsy associated with minor head injury. No initial loss of consciousness was recalled. Computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) of the brain were normal. Previous reports in the literature were reviewed and the possible mechanism of injury was discussed. Head injuries are commonly seen in sports settings. Our case illustrated that even minor head trauma can cause isolated oculomotor nerve palsy in the absence of abnormal brain imaging findings.

### Isolated trochlear nerve palsy with perimesencephalic subarachnoid haemorrhage [^113SMRam]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Medium credibility.

Perimesencephalic subarachnoid haemorrhage is usually asymptomatic other than meningeal irritation sign. The authors report a case of subarachnoid haemorrhage at the quadrigeminal cistern showing ipsilateral trochlear nerve palsy and discuss the pathogenesis. A 71-year-old man with a history of diabetes mellitus and acute myocardial infarction presented with diplopia. He underwent CT, which revealed subarachnoid haemorrhage at the left quadrigeminal cistern. Neurological examination revealed left isolated trochlear nerve palsy, with results otherwise normal. The diagnosis of perimesencephalic subarachnoid haemorrhage was established on neuroimaging. The amount of haemorrhage is related to symptoms. A dense clot in the quadrigeminal cistern might have been the cause of trochlear nerve palsy.

### Trochlear nerve palsy after repeated percutaneous balloon compression for recurrent trigeminal neuralgia: case report and pathogenic considerations [^113wrnaP]. Neurosurgery (2004). Low credibility.

Objective and Importance

Repeated percutaneous balloon compression for the treatment of idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia is infrequent. When a second procedure is performed, the outcome is unknown. A patient developed an isolated trochlear nerve palsy after undergoing percutaneous trigeminal ganglion balloon compression for a second time. The mechanism of diplopia and the complications associated with this technique were studied.

Clinical Presentation

The patient was a 67-year-old woman with a history of medically refractory idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia involving all three divisions of the right trigeminal nerve.

Intervention

Percutaneous balloon compression was performed. Despite initial total relief from pain without complications, the patient again displayed manifestations of trigeminal neuralgia 3 months after the procedure. The pain disappeared after she underwent a second balloon compression procedure, but she developed an isolated trochlear nerve palsy, which spontaneously resolved in 2 months.

Conclusion

Isolated trochlear nerve palsy is a rare and reversible complication after percutaneous balloon compression for trigeminal neuralgia. This case illustrates that the mechanism of injury to the fourth nerve is the result of an erroneous technique: excessive penetration of the Fogarty catheter in Meckel's cave beyond the porus trigemini and compression of the cisternal segment of the trochlear nerve when the inflated balloon is pushed against the tentorium.

### Prognostic factors for successful surgical outcomes in trochlear nerve palsy: a retrospective study and literature review [^116Y1z3X]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

This study revealed a high success rate for isolated inferior oblique muscle surgery in trochlear nerve palsy. A small preoperative hypertrophic angle (≤ 15 prism diopters) was significantly associated with favorable outcomes. Furthermore, younger age and good preoperative stereopsis demonstrated positive trends, although further studies are warranted to confirm their independent effects. These results reinforce the importance of preoperative assessment in surgical planning. Future research should focus on optimizing patient selection, refining surgical techniques, and assessing the long-term stability of surgical outcomes.

### High-resolution 3D MR imaging of the trochlear nerve [^115bVd8S]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2010). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

The cisternal segment of the trochlear nerve is difficult to identify reliably by routine MR imaging. We investigated the visibility and anatomic features of the trochlear nerve by using high-resolution 3D-bTFE imaging in healthy subjects.

Materials and Methods

This study was conducted with 32 healthy subjects without ocular movement disorders. For us to visualize the cisternal segment of the trochlear nerve, all subjects underwent 3D-bTFE imaging at 3T with 2 different resolutions: conventional resolution (voxel size, 0.67 × 0.45 × 1.4 mm) and high resolution (voxel size, 0.3 × 0.3 × 0.25 mm). Visibility of the trochlear nerve was graded with the use of a qualitative scale of certainty as follows: definite, probable, and indeterminate. The diameter of the trochlear nerve was measured.

Results

On conventional-resolution images, the visibility of the trochlear nerve was definite in 3 nerves, probable in 12 nerves, and indeterminate in 49 nerves. On high-resolution images, visibility was definite in 63 nerves and probable in 1 nerve. The mean diameter of the trochlear nerve was 0.54 mm (range, 0.35–0.96 mm).

Conclusions

The trochlear nerve was visualized 100% of the time on high-resolution imaging with a voxel smaller than the nerve diameter. High-resolution imaging should have an important role in investigating the pathogenic mechanism of neuropathic strabismus, such as congenital superior oblique palsy.

### Correlations between the clinical characteristics of diabetic trochlear nerve palsy and diplopia severity [^112R4E9p]. BMC Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study collected clinical data of 92 diabetic trochlear nerve palsy patients attended to the Ocular Motility Disorder Treatment Centre of the First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University from December 2018 to October 2024, when computerized diplopia test and neuroimaging had been available for every patient.

Diabetic peripheral neuropathy can damage the axons and/or myelin sheaths of peripheral nerves, leading to a range of sensory and motor impairments. Approximately 50% of diabetic patients eventually develop diabetic peripheral neuropathy. In our study, all patients have a mid-age onset (≥ 44 years), with males accounted for majority (72.8%). Male diabetic patients have a significantly increased risk of developing ophthalmoplegia compared to females. Although the reasons causing gender predominance are still not clear, our findings are consistent with the previous study. As described in the literatures, diabetic ophthalmoplegia tends to occur after the age of 40–50, indicating the diabetes history is significant in ophthalmoplegia reception for mid-age patients.

It is reported in literature that age (≥ 45 years) is identified as an independent risk factor for diabetic ophthalmoplegia. Approximately 25–30% of diabetic patients over 45 years develop ophthalmoplegia, In this study, with no other difference was found between ages in duration of diabetes, HbA1c value and time of symptom onset, the mid-age diabetic trochlear nerve palsy patients (≤ 60 years) experience more sever diplopia than the old-age patients (> 60 years, p = 0.011), which could be an interesting topic in the future.

Furthermore, in this study, age was not correlated with the severity of diplopia. It is speculated that age may be a risk factor for the occurrence of ophthalmoplegia in diabetic patients, but it is not necessarily correlated with the severity of diplopia.

### An algorithm for the evaluation of peripheral neuropathy… [^1137Xx7M]. AAFP (1998). Low credibility.

Pathophysiology Although peripheral neuropathy has multiple etiologies, the nerve has a limited number of ways to respond to injury. 4, 5 The damage can occur at the level of the axon. A disruption of the axons results in degeneration of the axon and the myelin sheath distal to the site of the injury. In most toxic and metabolic injuries, the most distal portion of the axons degenerates, with concomitant breakdown of the myelin sheath. Neuronopathies occur at the level of the motor neuron or dorsal root ganglion, with subsequent degeneration of their peripheral and central processes. Because the injury is at the level of the cell body, recovery is often incomplete. Myelinopathies occur at the level of the myelin sheath and can be inflammatory or hereditary. In acquired demyelinating neuropathies, the injury is often patchy or segmental.

Because the axons are relatively spared, recovery is often rapid and complete. Hereditary abnormalities of myelin are usually diffuse, with a slowly progressive course. Patients may complain of pain with innocuous stimuli such as sheets rubbing over their feet. They may also describe a tight, band-like sensation around the ankles or wrists. Sensory symptoms include tingling or paresthesias, increased sensation in affected areas, and numbness or reduced sensation. Dying-back neuropathies initially involve the tips of the toes and progress proximally in a stocking-glove distribution. Multifocal neuropathies, such as mononeuritis multiplex caused by polyarteritis nodosa, may result in sensory abnormalities in specific nerve or root distributions. Axon loss results in loss of amplitude of nerve action potentials, and evidence of denervation is found on needle examination of affected muscles.

Myelin loss results in slowed conduction velocities, prolonged distal latencies, conduction block, temporal dispersion and prolonged minimum F-wave latencies. The limitations of EMG/NCS should be taken into account when interpreting the findings. We have no reliable means of studying proximal sensory nerves. NCS results can be normal in patients with small-fiber neuropathies, and lower extremity sensory responses can be absent in normal elderly patients. EMG/NCS are not substitutes for a good clinical examination.

### Expanding the clinical spectrum of idiopathic intracranial hypertension [^113MEoPX]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

IDIOPATHIC INTRACRANIAL HYPERTENSION WITH UNUSUAL CRANIAL NERVE INVOLVEMENT

The diagnostic criteria for IIH requires a normal neurological examination with the exception of abducens nerve palsy, which has an established association with raised ICP. However, reports of other cranial nerve involvement have been described in the literature, most often in the setting of so-called 'pseudotumor cerebri'. However, many of these historical cases would not satisfy the diagnostic criteria for IIH by today's measures. IIH remains a diagnosis of exclusion and the presence of other cranial nerve involvement should prompt investigation for an alternative diagnosis or explanation for the finding.

Case reports have variously described involvement of the oculomotor nerve. This most frequently presents with unilateral or bilateral pupil-sparing, extraocular muscle palsy, which resolves following ICP reduction. An anatomical basis for this is not certain. However, a widely proposed hypothesis contends that downward displacement of the brainstem results in tractional impingement of the oculomotor nerve.

Presentations with simultaneous involvement of the oculomotor, trochlear, and abducens nerves, causing diffuse ophthalmoplegia or global ophthalmoparesis, have also been described. These presentations are associated with markedly elevated CSF pressures (≥ 50 cmCSF) and are almost always because of a secondary cause. Careful investigation with magnetic resonance venography for cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, and repeat lumbar puncture and antiganglioside antibody serology for Miller Fisher Syndrome may be required to exclude these differentials.

Trochlear nerve palsy has been described in case reports of mainly teenagers with IIH. Some of these cases have been associated with use of medications including minocycline, topical Vitamin A, and nalidixic acid. This underscores the importance of taking an accurate medication history in all patients presenting with an IIH syndrome. A recent systematic review found that Vitamin A derivatives, tetracycline-class antibiotics, recombinant growth hormone, and lithium are most strongly associated with drug-induced intracranial hypertension. Evidence of trochlear nerve palsy resolved in all reported cases after ICP-lowering therapy and cessation of the provoking medication.

### Retrospective analysis of factors related to the long-term recovery of third, fourth, and sixth cranial nerve palsy with etiologies and clinical course in a tertiary hospital [^114zctcE]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

Results

Patient Demographics

Our study included 65 patients with oculomotor nerve palsy, 58 subjects with trochlear nerve palsy, and 177 with abducens nerve palsy. Table 1 presents the demographic data.

Table 1
Demographic Data of Cranial Nerve Palsy

Oculomotor Nerve Palsy

Subjects with oculomotor nerve palsy had a mean age of 50.34 years. The onset of palsy was approximately 14 days. Most subjects had unilateral and isolated nerve palsy. The most common etiologies were ischemic and compressive. The complete recovery rate of oculomotor nerve palsy was 35.4% and for those receiving strabismus surgery was 10.8%. In cases with full recovery, the average duration was 4.74 months.

Trochlear Nerve Palsy

The average age of patients with trochlear nerve palsy was 54.75 years, with a median onset of 90 days. Most subjects had unilateral and isolated involvement. The rate of acquired trochlear nerve palsy was 73.7%. Trauma was the most common etiology in this set of patients. Idiopathic etiology was ranked second. In this group, 26.3% had complete recovery and 21.1% received strabismus surgery due to inferior oblique muscle weakening. Among these groups, the average duration of recovery was 5.39 months.

Abducens Nerve Palsy

Abducens nerve palsy was the most common palsy among the three groups. The average age of the subjects was 48.71 years, with a mean onset of 84.25 days. Most subjects had unilateral and isolated involvement. Traumatic causes were the most common etiology in this population. The second and third most common etiologies were inflammation and ischemic, respectively. In our population, 44.1% had complete recovery and 14.3% received strabismus surgery. The average recovery time was 4.76 months.

### Image-guided placement of eye muscle electrodes for intraoperative cranial nerve monitoring [^115tPefE]. Neurosurgery (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

Monitoring of the oculomotor system during cranial base or brainstem surgery requires extraocular intraorbital insertion of electromyography electrodes. We investigated the use of image-guidance technology for anatomically correct intraorbital electrode placement.

Methods

For neuronavigation, an optical tracking system was used in a standard fashion. Needle electrodes were inserted percutaneously into the lateral rectus, inferior rectus, and superior oblique muscle along the axis of a hand-held pointer or by means of an electrode applicator to allow direct tracking with the navigation system. Electromyographic monitoring was performed by multichannel recordings of free running or evoked activity from the selected muscles.

Results

We have used this method in 10 patients; 5 had cranial base tumors and 5 underwent operations for brainstem lesions. No additional instruments or resources were required compared with the routine setup, and no intraorbital structures were injured. Successful monitoring of oculomotor, trochlear, or abducent nerve function was possible in each case.

Conclusion

This method may have the potential to increase the safety and success rate of intraoperative electro-ophthalmography during microsurgery focused on preservation of neurological function.

### Gamma knife surgery for schwannomas originating from cranial nerves III, IV, and VI [^111vD9Hb]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2008). Low credibility.

Object

Schwannomas from the motor cranial nerves controlling eye movement are rare. The authors evaluated the role of Gamma Knife surgery (GKS) in the management of schwannomas originating from cranial nerves III, IV, and VI.

Methods

Over a 7-year period, 8 patients with schwannomas originating from the oculomotor (2 patients), trochlear (5 patients), or abducent (1) nerve underwent GKS. The mean patient age was 46.1 years (range 19–59 years). The presenting symptoms included diplopia in 5 patients, ptosis in 1 patient, ophthalmoplegia in 1 patient, and headache in 1 patient. Two patients had a history of neurofibromatosis Type 2. Gamma Knife surgery was performed as primary management in 7 patients and after prior resection in 1 patient. The median and mean tumor volumes were 0.22 and 1.32 cm³ (range 0.03–7.4 cm³). A median margin dose of 12.5 Gy (range 11.0–13.0 Gy) was prescribed to the tumor margin. Clinical and imaging follow-up data were available for all 8 patients.

Results

Magnetic resonance imaging showed tumor regression in all patients. The progression-free period varied from 4 to 42 months, with a mean of 21 months. Over a mean of 23 months, 4 of the 5 patients with a trochlear schwannoma and symptoms of diplopia noted symptomatic improvement. No improvement was noted in the 2 patients with oculomotor nerve palsies. Headache was improved in the 1 patient with an abducent neuroma.

Conclusions

Gamma Knife surgery is an effective and minimally invasive approach capable of inactivating schwannomas originating from the oculomotor, trochlear, and abducent nerves. Accompanying trochlear function may improve. Longer follow-up and larger patient samples are needed to confirm the authors' initial observations.

### Correlations between the clinical characteristics of diabetic trochlear nerve palsy and diplopia severity [^1152Reri]. BMC Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Materials and methods

We reviewed the medical records of 609 isolated trochlear nerve palsy patients who were admitted to the Ocular Motility Disorder Treatment Centre of the First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University from December 2018 to October 2024.

The diagnosis of isolated trochlear nerve palsy was made according to the following criteria: ① binocular vertical diplopia (or oblique) diplopia worse in the contralateral gaze; ② hypertropia in the primary gaze; ③ positive Bielschowsky test or head-tilt test; ④ computerized diplopia test indicating superior oblique muscle palsy. MRI and/or CT scans were performed for every patient, and 467 nondiabetic trochlear nerve palsy patients, such as those with strabismus, congenital trochlear nerve palsy, brainstem infarction, trauma, and intracranial neoplasm, were excluded. Patients with infarction indicated by neuroimaging exams were not excluded if the infarct lesion did not cause trochlear nerve palsy. 50 patients without intact clinical index records were excluded, and 92 eligible patients were ultimately included (Fig. 1).

Fig. 1
Study flow diagram

The computerized diplopia test is the latest device based on the principles of the Hess screen test, which was designed by LY Zhou, can display patients' orientation of diplopia, precisely locate paralyzed extraocular muscles and quantitatively measure the deviation of diplopia.

This system works as follows: patients sit at a 1 m working distance with 20° of ocular rotation, wear red-blue glasses, operate the mouse, and align the red point with the blue circle separately at 9 gaze positions. The program then switches the color of the point and circles automatically and repeats the test. The system will generate graphics (Fig. 2), which indicate the orientation and deviations of diplopia horizontally and vertically (α represents horizontal deviation; β represents vertical deviation) and Hess screen test outcomes (Fig. 3) for supplementation. In Fig. 2, the red spots represent 9 primary gaze positions, and the blue rectangles are the red spots actually seen by patients on the screen. Diplopia Gaze positions from 1 to 9 correspond with Top left, Up, Top right, Left, Primary, Right, Bottom left, Down and Bottom right.

### Lifetime risk, sex and age differences in annual incidence of ocular motor cranial nerve palsy in Japan for 2019 [^112Hcx2p]. Communications Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

We aimed to demonstrate the incidence and subtype proportions of ocular motor cranial nerve palsy (OMCNP) by age group and sex, and to estimate the associated lifetime risks in the Japanese population.

Methods

This nationwide, population-based, cross-sectional cohort study utilized data from the National Database of Health Insurance Claims and Specific Health Checkups of Japan, provided by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, covering almost all (≥ 95%) claims. We identified newly diagnosed OMCNP cases (oculomotor, trochlear, or abducens palsy) between January 1 and December 31, 2019, separated by sex and age category (5-year steps). We calculated the incidence rate as the proportion relative to the Japanese population, and calculated the lifetime risk. Furthermore, we calculated the age-standardized incidence rate and lifetime risk according to the world population distribution.

Results

The crude incidence rate of OMCNP is 17.36 (oculomotor palsy, 6.62 [38.1%]; trochlear palsy, 2.61 [15.0%]; abducens palsy, 8.14 [46.9%]) per 100,000 person-years. The incidence rate increases with age and is higher in men than in women (19.91 vs. 14.96). The lifetime risks of oculomotor, trochlear, and abducens palsies are 0.50%, 0.19%, and 0.61%, respectively. The age-standardized incidence rates of oculomotor, trochlear, and abducens palsies are 3.25 (lifetime risk, 0.35%), 1.28 (lifetime risk, 0.13%), and 4.60 (lifetime risk, 0.45%) per 100,000 person-years, respectively.

Conclusions

This nationwide study of > 100 million people reveals that OMCNP incidence increases with age and is higher in men. Approximately one in 100 individuals is affected in their lifetime. Our comprehensive analysis of OMCNP demographics provides important information for addressing healthcare, particularly for older people, from social and public health perspectives.

### Diabetic mononeuropathies and diabetic amyotrophy [^114MYgrq]. Diabetes Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Fourth and Sixth (Trochlear and Abducens) Cranial Mononeuropathies

Next to the third cranial nerve the most commonly involved cranial nerve is the sixth followed by the fourth. In an analysis of 811 cases of oculomotor palsies, diabetes was present in 2.6% of the third nerve palsies, 1.9% of the sixth nerve palsies and 0.6% of fourth nerve palsies. In another series of 24 subjects with diabetes with a cranial mononeuropathy, 17 had a third nerve palsy (2 bilateral), 7 had a sixth nerve palsy, and there were no fourth nerve palsies.

These fourth and sixth nerve palsies most often occur in patients above the age of 50, but in this group the prodromal pain is less frequent and less severe than with a third nerve palsy. Once again, recovery is almost complete within 3 months. Unlike a third nerve palsy, because of the long intracranial courses of the fourth and sixth cranial nerves it is difficult to eliminate an intracranial cause without appropriate investigation and/or neurological consultation. Therefore, watchful waiting is not an option. Within 6–12 weeks resolution, which is almost always complete, occurs.

Seventh (Facial) Cranial Mononeuropathy

There is also an increase in the incidence of Bell's palsy in patients with diabetes. The presentation is the classic ipsilateral facial weakness including the muscles of the forehead, which indicates that this is a lower cranial nerve lesion. In addition, the absence of ageusia (loss of taste) suggests that the infarction of the facial nerve is distal to where the chorda tympani leaves the facial nerve.

### Correlations between the clinical characteristics of diabetic trochlear nerve palsy and diplopia severity [^1137F7Kt]. BMC Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

In our observation, some diabetes patients had transient diplopia previously without any sequelae. Literature reported that improvement in HbA1c value can significantly promote functional recovery from diabetic peripheral neuropathy in a short-term. Improvement of microcirculatory dysfunction might be the possible explanation, which requires further clinical research to probe into the underlying mechanism. Findings above emphasize the importance of controlling blood glucose in diabetic ophthalmoplegia patients, which may be crucial to reduce morbidity and improve prognosis of ophthalmoplegia.

In the previous literature, diabetes duration over 10-years was identified as an independent risk factor for the development of diabetic ophthalmoplegia. Other literatures described that older diabetic patients with longer duration of diabetes are more prone to ophthalmoplegia. Our study found that the duration of diabetes correlates with the severity of diplopia in all patients (P = 0.026 < 0.05). Furthermore, the duration of diabetes is an independent risk factor for the severity of diplopia, meaning that patients with longer duration of diabetes experience more severe diplopia (P = 0.035 < 0.05). This finding could provide clues to treatment and prognosis.

### Percutaneous radiofrequency treatment of the gasserian ganglion for trigeminal neuralgia complicated by trochlear nerve palsy: a case report [^113dcSDD]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Figure 1
Steep path of the needle tip as it is inserted in the cheek and passes behind the zygomatic bone and through the foramen ovale to the trigeminal ganglion.

RF-G is generally considered safe and complications are few. In a cohort of 1600 patients, Kanpolat et al reported 225 patients with complications after 2138 RF-G procedures. Diminished corneal reflex was observed in 91 patients (5.7%), masseter dysfunction in 66 (4.1%), anesthesia dolorosa and carotid puncture both in 12 patients (each 0.75%), keratitis in 10 patients (0.6%), cerebrospinal fluid leakage in 2 (0.13%) and meningitis in 1 (0.06%). Transient palsy of a cranial nerve (CN) was present in 12 patients (0.75%) (CN3 1 patient, CN6 11 patients). Permanent damage to CN6 was reported for two patients (0.13%).

CN palsy is a rare complication of RF-G, and the majority of studies citing CN palsies date back decades ago. CN damage after invasive treatment for TN seems not to be linked to one particular CN, and literature is not conclusive to which CN is most prone to injury. We present a unique case of isolated transient trochlear nerve (cranial nerve 4 (CN4)) paralysis after percutaneous radiofrequency treatment of the gasserian ganglion for TN.

### Isolated bilateral trochlear nerve palsy as the first clinical sign of a metastatic [correction of metastasic] bronchial carcinoma [^113xJQZZ]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2001). Low credibility.

Purpose

To report a case with isolated, nontraumatic bilateral fourth nerve palsy as the first clinical sign of a metastatic lung carcinoma.

Methods

Case report. A 56-year-old man presented with isolated, nontraumatic bilateral fourth nerve palsy. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and orbits and, subsequently, chest x-ray and a computer tomographic (CT)-scan of the thorax, the abdomen, and the pelvis were performed.

Results

Magnetic resonance imaging confirmed the presence of a midline brain stem lesion in the region of decussation of the trochlear nerves. Computed tomographic scan of the chest revealed that the lesion was caused by a metastatic lung carcinoma.

Conclusion

The findings of isolated bilateral fourth nerve palsy in the absence of trauma should alert the clinician to the possibility of a posterior fossa lesion in the region of the trochlear nerves. Besides urgent scanning of the dorsal midbrain, investigations should be directed to search for the primary tumor.

### Clinical course and prognosis of trochlear nerve schwannomas [^113GDjB5]. Ophthalmology (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose

To delineate the disease course and prognosis of patients with mass lesions of the fourth nerve presumed to be schwannomas.

Design

Nonrandomized retrospective case series.

Participants

Thirty-seven consecutive cases of presumed trochlear nerve schwannoma from 9 tertiary university neuro-ophthalmology centers.

Methods

Cases were collected, and their clinical characteristics on presentation and follow-up are described. Inclusion criteria were brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with a lesion suggestive of a schwannoma along the course of the fourth nerve. Exclusion criteria were other causes of fourth nerve palsy, such as congenital, traumatic or microvascular; normal (or lack of) initial brain MRI; lack of adequate clinical information; and disappearance of the lesion on subsequent follow-up brain MRI.

Main Outcome Measures

Demographics of patients, presence of neurofibromatosis, symptoms on presentation, vertical deviation, lesion size (on presentation and follow-up), length of follow-up, and outcomes of treatment for lesions or diplopia.

Results

Seven patients were excluded and of the 30 patients included in our series, patients were predominantly male (77%) with a mean age of 51 years (range 9–102 years). In contrast with prior case reports, almost all of our cases had a fourth nerve palsy on presentation (29/30), often isolated. Mean follow-up was 3.1 years (range 0.2 months to 11.1 years). There was no significant difference between initial and follow-up lesion size (4.4 vs. 5 mm) for patients who did not receive treatment of lesions (P = 0.36). Only 3 patients underwent neurosurgical resection and an additional patient received gamma-knife radiotherapy. The majority of patients (24/30) did not pursue strabismus surgery for vertical diplopia.

Conclusions

Patients with isolated fourth nerve palsy and small lesions of the fourth nerve have a good prognosis and should be followed with serial MRI scans without neurosurgical intervention unless they develop signs of brain stem compression. Most patients with diplopia and benign fourth nerve lesions typical of trochlear nerve schwannoma can adapt with either prism spectacles or no treatment at all, although strabismus surgery can be successful.

### Etiologic distribution of isolated trochlear palsy: analysis of 1020 patients and literature review [^113DmsLk]. European Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose

Trochlear palsy is the most common cause of vertical diplopia. The etiologies of trochlear palsy have shown a large discrepancy among studies. This study aimed to establish the clinical features and underlying etiologies of isolated trochlear palsy by recruiting the patients from all departments in a referral-based university hospital.

Methods

We reviewed the medical records of 1258 patients who had a confirmed diagnosis of isolated trochlear palsy at all departments of Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, Seongnam, South Korea, from 2003 to 2020. We also compared the proportion of etiologies with that of the patients pooled from previous studies.

Results

The most common etiology was congenital (n = 330, 32.4%), followed by idiopathic (n = 256, 25.1%), microvascular (n = 212, 20.8%), and traumatic (n = 145, 14.2%). These four etiologies explained 92.5% of isolated trochlear palsy. Patients were mostly managed by ophthalmologists (n = 841, 82.5%), followed by neurologists (n = 380, 37.3%), emergency physicians (n = 197, 19.3%), neurosurgeons (n = 75, 7.4%), and others (n = 18, 1.8%). The etiologic distribution of isolated trochlear palsy in the current study did not differ from that of 2664 patients pooled from the previous studies.

Conclusions

The proportion of etiologies of isolated trochlear palsy differs according to the age ranges of the patients and specialties involved in the management. The etiologic distribution of isolated trochlear palsy in the current study was comparable to the pooled result of previous reports.

### Combined Brown syndrome and superior oblique palsy without a trochlear nerve: case report [^113DcY2r]. BMC Ophthalmology (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

In this report, we clearly showed that the right trochlear nerve was absent and ipsilateral SO muscle was hypoplastic, thus supporting that CCDD is one of the etiologic mechanisms of Brown syndrome.

Kaeser et al. first reported the association of congenital Brown syndrome and an absent trochlear nerve. They reported bilaterally absent trochlear nerves in two patients and a unilaterally absent trochlear nerve in two other patients. Interestingly, the SO was not hypoplastic in any of their four patients suggesting the possibility of an alternative innervation. However, they used a 1.5-Tesla magnetic resonance unit (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany), and in our experience, the trochlear nerve was visible only by using a voxel smaller than the diameter of the trochlear nerve in a high-resolution 3-Tesla system. In our previous studies on congenital superior oblique palsy, all the patients without a trochlear nerve were unilaterally affected, and their paretic SO areas and volumes were significantly smaller than the normal side. In contrast, in patients with a normal trochlear nerve, the paretic SO areas and volume showed no significant difference with the normal side. Therefore, it is unlikely to observe a normal-sized SO in any patient without a trochlear nerve, particularly if the SO palsy is congenital. The possibility of synkinesis may arise in such conditions with a normal-sized SO and absent trochlear nerve, however, the size of the SO may still be smaller than the contralateral normal side as found in our case.

### Superior oblique myokymia caused by vascular compression in the peripheral trochlear nerve: a case report [^113p523P]. Neurosurgery Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

TABLE.
Neurosurgical Case Reports of Superior Oblique Myokymia

In our case, preoperative 3D fusion imaging revealed the absence of blood vessels around the REZ of the trochlear nerve. Therefore, neurosurgery may not have been indicated in other facilities. We diagnosed SOM based on the following aspects: the possibility of thin blood vessels not visualized on imaging compressing the nerve's origin, strong compression of the peripheral nerve, and typical symptom presentation. Previously, thin blood vessels not visualized on preoperative images that compressed the nerve origin during surgery were confirmed. Furthermore, hemifacial spasms can occur not only due to compression at the nerve's origin but also from peripheral compression, also resulting in SOM. Hence, preoperative 3D fusion imaging is valuable for facilitating decisions to opt for surgery.

Although our patient experienced brief, mild trochlear nerve palsy, MVD resulted in complete recovery. The patient was satisfied with the treatment and reported improved functional ability after resolution of complications.

MVD treatment of SOM requires an experienced surgical team. The trochlear nerve is exposed in a similar manner to that of the trigeminal nerve; however, it is redirected medially and superiorly. Our team has performed over 700 MVD surgeries for various conditions, demonstrating the expertise required to safely manage challenging cases such as SOM.

SOM diagnosis is relatively uncomplicated when a patient exhibits short-lived episodes of ocular fluttering sensations lasting for a few seconds. Clinical symptoms are the most crucial for diagnosis, even if preoperative imaging does not depict blood vessel compression, as narrow blood vessels could still compress the nerve. Based on this case, MVD is recommended for patients diagnosed with SOM with medically refractory symptoms.

### Correlations between the clinical characteristics of diabetic trochlear nerve palsy and diplopia severity [^111SuFyy]. BMC Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Diabetic trochlear nerve palsy, a form of diabetic peripheral neuropathy, causes paralysis of the superior oblique muscle. The typical symptom is vertical or oblique diplopia, with hypertropia in the primary gaze and a positive Bielschowsky test. Diplopia becomes worse when patients are on downgaze, which causes problems such as difficulty in walking downstairs. Some patients found that the diplopia could be alleviated when compensatory head posture was taken and did not pay enough attention to it, which could delay diagnosis and treatment. Unlike oculomotor nerve palsy or abducens nerve palsy, manifestations of trochlear nerve palsy are subtle and easily missed by doctors in the neurology or ophthalmology departments. A retrospective study conducted on ophthalmoplegia patients with diabetes revealed that oculomotor nerve palsy accounts for the majority of cases, followed by abducens nerve palsy, whereas trochlear nerve palsy is rare. In another retrospective study examining the etiology of 74 patients with trochlear nerve palsy, only 5 cases attributed to diabetes were reported. According to our clinical observations, diabetic trochlear nerve palsy is not rare, and its characteristics are still ambiguous with finite reports. We analyzed the medical records of 92 patients with diabetic trochlear nerve palsy, combing computerized diplopia test and the Ocular Motor Nerve Palsy Scale assessment to evaluate the orientation and deviation of diplopia, to explore the correlations between gender, age, involved eye, time of symptom onset, duration of diabetes, HbA1c level and severity of diplopia.

### Retrospective analysis of factors related to the long-term recovery of third, fourth, and sixth cranial nerve palsy with etiologies and clinical course in a tertiary hospital [^1146ABKg]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Although various studies have explored the causes and clinical aspects of cranial nerve palsies, there remains a significant gap in understanding the prognostic factors that influence outcomes. In this study, we sought to address this gap by investigating the incidence, etiologies, clinical courses, and factors associated with long-term recovery, with the aim of enhancing the knowledge base in this field and providing valuable insights for improved patient care.

Patients and Methods

This retrospective study evaluated the data gathered from subjects who had third, fourth, and sixth cranial nerve palsy at the ophthalmology outpatient clinic of Phramongkutklao Hospital between April 1, 2012, and April 30, 2022.

Results

Among the three nerves, abducens nerve palsy was the most prevalent finding by most commonly involved. Our study revealed that ischemic and compressive lesions were the most common etiology of oculomotor nerve palsy, comprising 24.6% each. In addition, the most common etiology of trochlear and abducens nerve palsy was trauma, at 31.6% and 27.1%, respectively. Compared with the other nerves, oculomotor nerve palsy was associated with a shorter duration onset of symptoms and recovery period. The best recovery outcomes among the various etiologies were inflammation, ischemic events, and trauma in oculomotor, trochlear, and abducens nerve palsy, respectively. Logistic regression revealed that an onset of < 7 days and isolated nerve involvement were significantly associated with good long-term outcomes, with an adjusted odds ratio of 1.73 (95% confidence interval, 1.03–2.89) and 2.56 (95% confidence interval, 1.21–5.39) adjusted for the type of cranial nerve palsy, aged at 50 years, sex, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, dyslipidemia, onset at 7 days, and number of cranial nerves involved, respectively.

Conclusion

The onset of symptoms in less than 1 week and isolated nerve involvement were associated with better prognosis in subjects with third, fourth, and sixth cranial nerve palsy.

### Nuances in visual rehabilitation after pituitary surgery [^113U2RTh]. Neuro-Oncology Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

The care for debilitating diplopia that persists for weeks to months after surgery should be escalated in conjunction with a neuro-ophthalmology team. Botulinum toxin is often a first line of interventional correction among other injection agents. Botulinum toxin prevents the release of acetylcholine from axonal endings at the neuromuscular junction, causing paralysis of any muscle targeted through injection. When a cranial nerve palsy persists, tonic activation of counteracting muscles causes diplopia. Since cranial nerve palsies produce reliable diplopia syndromes, botulinum toxin injections can weaken or paralyze specific counteracting muscles to bring the globe to a neutral alignment. For instance, botulinum toxin injections in the lateral rectus can help negate the exotropia caused by oculomotor palsy. Injections to the inferior oblique muscle counteract the effects of a trochlear palsy, and injections to the medial rectus counteract the impact of an abducens palsy.

Surgical intervention can improve acquired diplopia from cranial nerve palsies when conservative measures and botulinum toxin injections prove insufficient. Surgical options for diplopia should be considered in conjunction with neuro-ophthalmologists and oculoplastic surgeons and depend on the cadence of symptoms, the specific cranial nerves involved, and the degree of extraocular muscle dysfunction. The goal of surgery for diplopia is usually to re-align the affected eye through muscle and tendon transpositions as well as resective reductions. Given the high rate of recovery from many extraocular movement palsies, waiting 6 months before considering surgery for persistent diplopia maximizes the opportunity for spontaneous recovery.

Surgery for oculomotor palsy includes medial rectus resection and lateral rectus recession to correct horizontal deviation, and superior oblique tendon transposition to adduct the globe into a neutral position. After alignment of the affected eye, lid ptosis can also be surgically corrected. The selection of surgery for trochlear nerve palsy depends on the laxity of the superior oblique muscle on forced duction testing and the degree of hypertropia. For cases with minor hypertropias, the inferior oblique can be reduced. For larger hypertropias, inferior oblique reduction can be combined with superior rectus recession. For partial abducens nerve palsies, the lateral rectus may be resected and the ipsilateral medial rectus is recessed. For complete lateral rectus muscle paresis, there are several complex reconstructions that can be considered.

### Prognostic factors for successful surgical outcomes in trochlear nerve palsy: a retrospective study and literature review [^116mwdxs]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Previous studies have reported high surgical success rates for trochlear nerve palsy surgery;, however, the prognostic factors influencing the optimal outcomes remain unclear. Our analysis identified a smaller preoperative hypertrophic angle as a significant predictor of excellent surgical outcomes by 12 months postoperatively. Moreover, patients in our cohort most commonly presented with Knapp type 3, and inferior oblique myectomy was the most frequently performed and most successful surgery.

Smaller preoperative hypertropia angles were significantly associated with favorable surgical outcomes in patients with trochlear nerve palsy who underwent single-muscle inferior oblique surgery. Our results are congruent with the findings of previous studies indicating that inferior oblique weakening procedures effectively correct hypertropia of < 20 prism diopters. However, by focusing exclusively on patients who underwent single-muscle surgery, our study reveals targeted evidence that preoperative deviations of ≤ 15 prism diopters particularly predict successful outcomes. This finding validates the role of preoperative deviation magnitude in guiding surgical decision-making, as patients with larger deviations may require additional cyclovertical muscle procedures to achieve optimal alignment.

Univariate analysis revealed that good preoperative stereopsis (≤ 140 arcseconds) and younger age (< 15 years) were significantly associated with favorable surgical outcomes. However, these associations lost significance in multivariate analysis, indicating that other variables, such as preoperative hypertropia, may mediate their effects. Furthermore, previous studies have determined both factors as crucial prognostic indicators for successful strabismus surgery, particularly in trochlear nerve palsy. Our results do not establish them as independent predictors, but they highlight potential trends that warrant further investigation in larger cohorts to determine their specific role in surgical outcomes.

Younger age has been a significant factor affecting trochlear nerve palsy surgical outcomes, probably due to greater vertical fusional capacity, fewer comorbidities, and improved postoperative healing, all contributing to improved alignment stability. Our results are congruent with Aoba et aland Lau et alreporting poorer outcomes and higher reoperation rates in older patients. However, conflicting evidence exists. Khanna et alreported superior motor outcomes in older patients, whereas Lee et alrevealed that younger patients were less likely to experience motor function and head tilt improvements. These various results highlight the complexity of age-related factors in surgical success, emphasizing the need for further research to delineate its precise effect.

### Congenital isolated unilateral third nerve palsy in children: the diagnostic contribution of high-resolution MR imaging [^114AWzMH]. Neuroradiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To describe the neuroanatomical correlates of unilateral congenital isolated oculomotor palsy by means of high-resolution MRI.

Methods

Children with a clinical diagnosis of congenital isolated oculomotr palsy and with a high-resolution MRI acquisition targeted on the orbits and cranial nerves were selected and included in the study. An experienced pediatric neuroradiologist evaluated all the exams, assessing the integrity and morphology of extraocular muscles, oculomotor, trochlear and abducens nerves as well as optic nerves and globes. Clinical data and ophthalmologic evaluations were also collected.

Results

Six children (age range: 1–16 years; males: 3) were selected. All patients showed, on the affected side (left:right = 5:1), anomalies of the III nerve and extraocular muscles innervated by the pathological nerve. One patient had complete nerve agenesis, two patients showed a diffuse thinning of the nerve, from the brainstem to the orbit and 3 patients showed a distal thinning of the oculomotor nerve, starting at the level of the cavernous sinus. In all cases atrophy of corresponding muscles was noticed, but the involvement of the affected muscles varied with the nervous pattern of injury.

Conclusions

High-resolution MRI represents a valuable tool for the diagnosis of III nerve anomalies in unilateral congenital IOP, showing different patterns of nerve involvement and muscular atrophy.

### Superior oblique myokymia caused by vascular compression in the peripheral trochlear nerve: a case report [^115F5ZFQ]. Neurosurgery Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

BACKGROUND AND IMPORTANCE:

We report the first case of microvascular decompression (MVD) performed for superior oblique myokymia (SOM) caused by vascular compression of the peripheral trochlear nerve, leading to successful resolution of symptoms.

CLINICAL PRESENTATION:

A 46-year-old man with no significant medical history experienced intermittent fluttering sensations in his left eye for 6 years. Initial examinations revealed an intorsional microtremor diagnosed as SOM. Conventional brain MRI showed no abnormalities. Despite using anticonvulsants with no relief, his condition worsened. A more detailed MRI revealed compression of the peripheral trochlear nerve by a branch of the superior cerebellar artery. MVD surgery was recommended. A lateral supracerebellar infratentorial approach was used during MVD surgery. The compressed nerve was identified and relieved by wrapping the compressing branch in Teflon felt and repositioning it. After the surgery, the symptoms ceased immediately, and the patient was discharged within a week. Although he initially had mild trochlear nerve palsy with double vision on downward gaze, this resolved within 9 months without recurrence at the 22-month follow-up. Previous cases treated with MVD showed symptom relief, although some experienced temporary nerve palsy. No deaths were reported from the procedure.

CONCLUSION:

MVD is an effective treatment method for SOM that can occur not only at the root exit zone of the trochlear nerve but also due to peripheral trochlear nerve compression.

### Development of a core outcome set for amblyopia, strabismus and ocular motility disorders: a review to identify outcome measures [^117R7vni]. BMC Ophthalmology (2019). Medium credibility.

Ocular motility disorders secondary to neurogenic disorders (n = 6) (Supp. Table 4.4)

These refer to conditions such as third, fourth and sixth cranial nerve palsies. Clinical outcome measures included here in addition were "palpebral fissure size" and "pupil size" for third nerve palsy. Bi et al. used "The cervical range motion (CROM) score" to quantify diplopia in a pilot RCT on acupuncture for the treatment of oculomotor paralysis.

In the review by Engel, in congenital fourth nerve palsy, alignment was checked with "a more sensitive 2-step test". "Facial asymmetry" was evaluated, and "superior oblique muscle atrophy/absent trochlear nerve" were examined with "high definition MRI" in the same study. "Abnormal head position" was measured objectively using "a goniometer" in degrees. An important adverse event sought after treatment here included "secondary Brown syndrome".

In sixth nerve palsy, motility outcomes were included to reveal any "degree of incomitance" while measuring deviation, and to check for "medial rectus muscle contracture" using "forced duction test". "Scott's force generation test" or "electrooculography/electromyography" were used to assess "lateral rectus muscle function".

### Trochlear nerve decompression by endoscopic suboccipital supracerebellar infratentorial approach: a technical note: 2-dimensional operative video [^112wmeMp]. Operative Neurosurgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Importance

Superior oblique myokymia (SOM) is a rare, acquired aberration of the innervation of the superior oblique, resulting in episodic monocular contraction of the superior oblique muscle characterized by intermittent rotatory eye movement causing diplopia and oscillopsia. Several treatment modalities have been described to treat SOM, including medication and surgical interventions. There is a paucity of reports describing microvascular decompression (MVD) of the trochlear nerve near the root entry zone for the treatment of a neurovascular conflict. The authors describe a case report of a patient who presented with SOM by a supracerebellar infratentorial approach using microscopic and endoscopic visualization.

Clinical Presentation

A 40-year-old woman presented with an 8-month history of rhythmic contractions of her right orbit with worsening double vision and occasional balance issues. Neuro-ophthalmological evaluation which revealed a right-sided SOM. MRI evaluation demonstrated a potential vascular compression by the superior cerebellar artery near the origin of the trochlear nerve. She underwent MVD by a supracerebellar infratentorial approach using microscopic and endoscopic visualization. The patient experienced resolution of her SOM in the immediate postoperative period and a Trochlear nerve palsy that resolved within 6 months.

Conclusion

The endoscopic supracerebellar infratentorial approach for MVD of the trochlear nerve is a safe and efficacious approach that provides superior visualization of the trochlear nerve at its origin and in the setting of SOM. This approach shows outcomes comparable with those used in previously described cases.

### Combined Brown syndrome and superior oblique palsy without a trochlear nerve: case report [^114vmGrJ]. BMC Ophthalmology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Congenital Brown syndrome is characterized by limited elevation particularly during adduction. The pathogenesis of congenital Brown syndrome is still controversial.

Case Presentation

A 6-year-old boy had been tilting his head to the left since infancy. He showed right hypertropia (RHT) of 2 prism diopters (Δ) in the primary position. He showed RHT 6Δ in right gaze, RHT 2Δ in left gaze, RHT 12Δ in right head tilt, and orthotropia in left head tilt. The right eye showed limitation of elevation and depression on adduction, and the left eye showed overdepression on adduction. MR images showed an absent right trochlear nerve with a hypoplastic ipsilateral superior oblique muscle.

Conclusions

Congenital Brown syndrome may be associated with an absent trochlear nerve and hypoplastic superior oblique muscle suggesting an etiologic mechanism of congenital cranial dysinnervation disorder.

### Superior oblique myokymia caused by vascular compression in the peripheral trochlear nerve: a case report [^111xVFPQ]. Neurosurgery Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Importance

We report the first case of microvascular decompression (MVD) performed for superior oblique myokymia (SOM) caused by vascular compression of the peripheral trochlear nerve, leading to successful resolution of symptoms.

Clinical Presentation

A 46-year-old man with no significant medical history experienced intermittent fluttering sensations in his left eye for 6 years. Initial examinations revealed an intorsional microtremor diagnosed as SOM. Conventional brain MRI showed no abnormalities. Despite using anticonvulsants with no relief, his condition worsened. A more detailed MRI revealed compression of the peripheral trochlear nerve by a branch of the superior cerebellar artery. MVD surgery was recommended. A lateral supracerebellar infratentorial approach was used during MVD surgery. The compressed nerve was identified and relieved by wrapping the compressing branch in Teflon felt and repositioning it. After the surgery, the symptoms ceased immediately, and the patient was discharged within a week. Although he initially had mild trochlear nerve palsy with double vision on downward gaze, this resolved within 9 months without recurrence at the 22-month follow-up. Previous cases treated with MVD showed symptom relief, although some experienced temporary nerve palsy. No deaths were reported from the procedure.

Conclusion

MVD is an effective treatment method for SOM that can occur not only at the root exit zone of the trochlear nerve but also due to peripheral trochlear nerve compression.

### Dural tentorial arteriovenous fistula causing isolated trochlear nerve palsy: remission after endovascular embolization [^115rsagN]. Journal of Neurointerventional Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Objectives

To report an exceptional case of dural arteriovenous fistula of the tentorial incisura presenting as transient and recurrent isolated paresis of the fourth cranial nerve, and treated by endovascular embolization.

Case Report

A 63-year-old man presented several episodes of intermittent diplopia which appeared during sudden head movements and in the left lower gaze. Magnetic resonance and cerebral angiography showed a dural arteriovenous fistula of the right tentorial incisura fed mainly by branches of the right occipital artery as well as intracavernous branches of the right internal carotid artery. Embolization of the occipital artery branches resulted in significantly decreased flow within the fistula and in rapid and complete remission of diplopia. Stereotactic radiosurgery of the residual malformation was then performed. The treatment resulted in a good clinical and radiological outcome at the 5-year follow-up.

Conclusion

An arteriovenous fistula of the tentorial incisura may exceptionally cause intermittent diplopia owing to compression of the trochlear nerve due to transient increase of blood flow within the malformation. Remission of diplopia may be achieved by endovascular embolization. Dural arteriovenous fistulas with low risk of hemorrhage and brain neurological symptoms may successfully be treated by partial endovascular embolization and radiosurgery.

### Etiological distribution of isolated oculomotor nerve palsy: analysis of 633 patients and literature review [^113521Mw]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Literature review

A literature search was conducted on PubMed in May 2022 using the combination of terms "cause(s) or etiology" and "oculomotor (nerve) palsy". Fourteen articles that included more than 50 patients with a clear classification of the etiology of isolated oculomotor nerve palsy were found.

Comparison with isolated trochlear and abducens nerve palsy

The results of this study were compared with those of our previous reports on isolated trochlear palsy and isolated abducens nerve palsy performed in the same institution with the same methods during the same period.

Statistical analyses

The Mann–Whitney U test was used to compare the age between men and women and the preferential involvement of each eye. The chi‐squared test was adopted to compare the proportion of etiologies between men and women and between the current study and pooled data, the proportion of involved specialists according to age and etiology, the proportion of involved specialists amongst oculomotor, trochlear and abducens nerve palsies in our institution, the proportion of patients who visited the emergency department first according to clinical features, and the proportion of patients who visited the emergency department first amongst oculomotor, trochlear and abducens nerve palsies in our institution. All these tests were performed using SPSS (version 25) and p < 0.05 was considered significant. The Bonferroni correction was applied for post hoc analyses and multiple comparisons, and p < 0.05 was considered significant.

### Etiological distribution of isolated oculomotor nerve palsy: analysis of 633 patients and literature review [^1162UNJU]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

The etiological distribution of isolated oculomotor nerve palsy observed in this study was significantly different from that of the data pooled from the previous reports with a higher prevalence of neoplastic etiology and lower prevalence of microvascular, idiopathic and traumatic etiologies. Our previous study also showed etiologies of isolated abducens nerve palsy that were different from those of the previous studies. These findings seem to be related to a referral bias since our hospital is less frequently involved in the management of traumatic patients.

The etiological distribution differed amongst the groups of isolated ocular motor nerve palsy recruited from our institution over the same period. These differences may be due to the anatomical and physiological characteristics of each ocular motor nerve. The oculomotor nerve passes between the superior cerebellar and posterior cerebral arteries, and runs inferolateral to the posterior communicating artery to enter the roof of the cavernous sinus. These characteristics may lead to a higher proportion of vascular anomalies amongst the etiologies. Each ocular motor nerve may have different vulnerabilities to microvascular ischaemia due to different blood supplies. Since the trochlear nerve has the longest intracranial course and smallest diameter, and passes the free edge of the tentorium, it would be more susceptible to injuries associated with head trauma than other ocular motor nerves.

The specialties involved in the management of isolated oculomotor nerve palsy differed markedly depending on the etiology. This finding is similar to that observed in our previous studies on isolated trochlear and abducens palsies. However, the proportion of involved specialists differed markedly amongst the isolated ocular motor nerve palsies (Figure 6c). Even though the ophthalmologists were mostly involved in the management of isolated oculomotor nerve palsy (75.0%), the proportion of involvement was lower than that in isolated trochlear palsy (82.5%) and higher than that in isolated abducens nerve palsy (71.4%, p < 0.001). This discrepancy seems also related to differences in the proportion of etiologies amongst the groups, especially the lower proportion of congenital etiology in isolated oculomotor and abducens nerve palsies.

### Abducens length and vulnerability? [^1133Bk77]. Neurology (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Several sources have attributed the vulnerability of the abducens nerve to its long intracranial course. However, other anatomic factors likely contribute to the apparent vulnerability of the abducens nerve to mass lesions and trauma.

Methods

The authors performed a two-part anatomic study of the abducens nerve. In the first part of the study, they compared the length of the abducens with another cranial nerve, the trochlear, at the autopsy of 26 pediatric patients. In the second part of the study, the authors used an endoscopic exposure of these two cranial nerves in a preserved human cadaver head.

Results

The abducens nerve was consistently approximately one-third the length of the trochlear nerve at all ages that they studied. The endoscopic views revealed the structural and vascular relationships of the abducens nerve in situ.

Conclusions

The authors conclude from these findings and the literature that abducens nerve vulnerability results from factors other than its intracranial length.

### Retrospective analysis of factors related to the long-term recovery of third, fourth, and sixth cranial nerve palsy with etiologies and clinical course in a tertiary hospital [^111dyvwL]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cranial nerve palsy is a complex neurologic disorder that is characterized by the dysfunction of one or more cranial nerves, and it can vary in clinical presentation and course. Three cranial nerves, namely, oculomotor, trochlear, and abducens nerves, are vital in controlling eye movements. Their dysfunction can result in an imbalance in ocular control, resulting in binocular diplopia. As evidenced by various reports in the literature, the incidence of cranial nerve palsy varies among different regions. Recent reports have indicated that the incidence rates of third, fourth, and sixth cranial nerve palsy among the Korean population are 3.71, 5.73, and 4.66 per 100,000 per year, respectively. These rates exhibit an age-dependent increase, accelerating notably after individuals reach 60 years of age. It is also noteworthy that these incidence rates are comparatively lower than those reported in the United States. The causes of these nerve palsies are diverse, encompassing ischemic events, trauma, aneurysms, and compressive lesions. Intriguingly, the distribution of etiological factors can vary, even within the same institution across different time frames. Moreover, the underlying etiology of these palsies is notably influenced by their clinical course, leading to a spectrum of outcomes that range from complete recovery to a lack of improvement.

Recent population-based studies have provided valuable insights into the etiologies of cranial nerve palsies. Oculomotor nerve palsy is predominantly attributed to microvascular causes, particularly in older adults. Pupillary involvement, although not specific to compressive lesions, is relatively rare. In the case of trochlear nerve palsy, evidence has revealed a bimodal distribution, with congenital factors prevalent in early childhood and vascular etiology more common in adults. In younger and adolescent patients, cranial nerve palsy typically has nonvascular origins. A retrospective series highlighted the prevalence of tumor-related causes in this demographic. However, the population-based literature often highlights a primarily congenital basis. High-resolution neuroimaging is pivotal in pathology demonstration and diagnostic support. Treatment modalities are tailored to the specific etiologies and are aimed at alleviating sequelae through interventions such as prism glasses, botulinum toxin, or strabismus surgery.

### Retrospective analysis of factors related to the long-term recovery of third, fourth, and sixth cranial nerve palsy with etiologies and clinical course in a tertiary hospital [^116Ctfsg]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

Materials and Methods

Study Participants

We analyzed the data/hospital records of patients who underwent treatment for cranial palsy in an inpatient/outpatient clinic at Phramongkutklao Hospital between April 1, 2012 and April 30, 2022. We included subjects who visited the ophthalmology clinic at least four times in a year with all recorded data available, and we excluded subjects who visited the clinic fewer than four times in a year and who had incompletely recorded data.

We recruited 297 subjects with oculomotor nerve palsy, 152 cases of trochlear nerve palsy, and 338 cases of abducens nerve palsy. After excluding patients with incomplete data, the overall numbers of subjects included in the analysis were 65 cases of oculomotor nerve palsy, 57 cases of trochlear nerve palsy, and 176 cases of abducens nerve palsy, respectively.

This study was retrospective in nature and approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Royal Thai Army (approval No. S027h/66_Exp).

Disease Definition

Oculomotor nerve palsy is defined as any presentation resulting from weakness of the oculomotor nerve, including exotropia, vertical misalignment, and ptosis with or without pupillary involvement. Trochlear nerve palsy is defined as any presentation that results from a weakness of the trochlear nerve, including vertical or torsional diplopia. Abducens nerve palsy is defined as any presentation resulting from weakness of the abducens nerve, including incomitant esotropia. The onset of symptoms refers to the duration between the onset of symptoms and the initial visit to the hospital. Oral corticosteroids are prescribed for treating inflammatory causes at our institution at a dose of 1 mg/kg per day for at least 2 weeks and a slower taper, depending on the case. There is no given treatment for ischemic etiology. Complete recovery is defined as the resolution of presenting signs and symptoms of the affected subjects. The entire ocular duction with orthotropia in the primary position is reserved for complete recovery of an ocular sign. An absence of clinical double vision was the favorable endpoint of symptoms. Partial recovery is defined as residual signs and symptoms at the endpoint.

### Etiological distribution of isolated oculomotor nerve palsy: analysis of 633 patients and literature review [^114ktrPa]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Third cranial nerve (oculomotor nerve) palsy is one of the most common causes of ophthalmoplegia and may indicate benign to life‐threatening causes. The incidence of acquired oculomotor nerve palsy increases with age and peaks in the 70s and 90s age groups with an annual incidence at 3.71–4.0 per 100,000. Even though microvascular, traumatic and intracranial aneurysms are the most common causes of oculomotor nerve palsy, the proportion of etiology has been different amongst studies depending on the study population and the department where the recruitment of patients was performed. Previous studies were primarily undertaken in referral‐based neuro‐ophthalmological clinics run exclusively by ophthalmologists or neurologists, which would have resulted in a referral bias. Even though our hospital has neuro‐ophthalmological clinics run by ophthalmologists and neurologists independently but in close cooperation and consultation, it was previously found that only 37.9% of the patients with binocular diplopia as the primary symptom were managed by both neurologists and ophthalmologists in our institution. Furthermore, the etiological proportion of diplopia, trochlear palsy and abducens nerve palsy significantly differed between the clinics.

This study aimed to establish the clinical features and underlying etiologies of isolated oculomotor nerve palsy by recruiting patients from all departments for an 18‐year period in a referral‐based university hospital in the Republic of Korea. The etiological distribution of isolated oculomotor palsy in the current study was also compared with that of pooled results from previous reports.

### Localization of post-traumatic trochlear nerve palsy associated with hemorrhage at the subarachnoid space by magnetic resonance imaging [^114RSWPM]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2001). Low credibility.

Purpose

To report evaluation of traumatic trochlear nerve palsy using head magnetic resonance imaging.

Design

Observational case reports.

Methods

We examined two cases involving trochlear nerve palsy after closed head injury.

Results

Using a fluid attenuated inversion recovery pulse sequence, MRI showed a high-intensity lesion consistent with subarachnoid hemorrhage at the trochlear nerve area in the ambient cisterns.

Conclusion

An impact force directed toward the tentorium can be a mechanism of injury in some post-traumatic trochlear nerve palsies. Fluid attenuated inversion recovery pulse sequence is a sensitive method for detection of abnormalities in cases associated with head injury.

### Percutaneous radiofrequency treatment of the gasserian ganglion for trigeminal neuralgia complicated by trochlear nerve palsy: a case report [^113HNduB]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

The day following the procedure, the patient complained of double vision and was examined at the emergency department by a neurologist. Diplopia was most pronounced when looking down. Monocular eyesight was normal, facial pain was absent. Postprocedural MRI of the brain showed enhanced signaling on the procedural side between the trigeminal ganglion and the brainstem (figure 2), and (asymptomatic) sinusitis of the maxillary and sphenoid sinus. Ophthalmic consultation established a restriction in function of the left superior oblique muscle, which is innervated by CN4. Prism correction proved unhelpful and otolaryngology examination gave no new insights. Trochlear nerve function spontaneously recovered to normal 5 months after the procedure.

### A review of ocular manifestations in intracranial hypotension [^111BA7jT]. Neurosurgical Focus (2007). Low credibility.

Object

Intracranial hypotension (ICH) can present with a wide variety of visual symptoms and findings. Deficits in visual acuity and visual fields as well as ophthalmoplegia due to cranial nerve dysfunction have been frequently described. The aim of this review was to identify the most commonly reported ocular manifestations associated with ICH.

Methods

The authors conducted a review of the literature to date to identify all studies of patients with ICH and ocular manifestations.

Results

The most commonly encountered cranial nerve deficit resulting from ICH (> 80% of reported cases) is an abducens nerve paresis, which may occur unilaterally or bilaterally. Although less common, oculomotor and trochlear nerve palsies have been reported as well. The optic nerve complex is frequently involved in ICH and may manifest as deficits in visual acuity and field cuts. Visual deficits and ophthalmoplegia improved following appropriate management in 97% of reported cases.

Conclusions

Intracranial hypotension can present with a wide spectrum of visual deficits, the causes of which are multifactorial. Cranial nerve paresis, especially of the abducens nerve, is frequently reported. The majority of symptoms and cranial nerve deficits reviewed respond favorably to conservative management, epidural blood patch administration, or in a minority of cases, surgical intervention.

### Skull base metastasis of breast cancer with oculomotor and trochlear nerve palsy [^117XHwxM]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Skull base metastatic tumors are rare. Breast cancer in particular can cause bone metastases after a long period of time. A 70-year-old woman presented with multiple cranial nerve palsy. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a lesion that extended from the orbit to the base of the skull, and the patient was referred to our department. Ophthalmological evaluation showed left visual acuity impairment, left oculomotor nerve palsy, and left trochlear nerve palsy. Endoscopic biopsy performed 5 years after the completion of breast cancer treatment revealed skull base metastases. In unilateral multiple cranial nerve palsy, the possibility of skull base metastases should be considered.

### Prognostic factors for successful surgical outcomes in trochlear nerve palsy: a retrospective study and literature review [^111unfJT]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Data Gathering

I collected each participant's demographic data, including age, sex, symptom duration, etiology, visual acuity, refractive error, preoperative head tilt, stereopsis, preoperative deviation angle, and surgical outcomes over time. Stereopsis was assessed using the Randot stereo test, with results presented in arcseconds. A strabismus specialist conducted all strabismus evaluations. A grading scale from 1+ to 4+ assessed inferior oblique overaction and superior oblique underaction. Visual acuity was measured as a Log Mar unit, and subjective refraction was measured. A contour stereo test was used for stereopsis measurement.

A comprehensive literature search was conducted using the PubMed database for English-language articles published between January 1, 2016, and June 30, 2024. Specific search keywords included "trochlear nerve palsy", "fourth nerve palsy", "strabismus surgery", "muscle surgery", "inferior oblique myectomy", "inferior oblique recession", "inferior oblique anterior transposition", and "inferior oblique weakening". I searched for relevant studies that included success rates and, principally, prognostic factors related to trochlear nerve palsy surgery. Our review comprised original research articles and case series. Case reports are excluded from the review of surgical outcomes in trochlear nerve palsy due to their limited sample size, lack of statistical significance, and absence of standardized methodology, which can reduce the reliability and generalizability of conclusions drawn from such isolated cases.

Surgeries

Participants' surgeries focused on a single cyclovertical muscle, operated on using one of three surgical techniques: inferior oblique myectomy, inferior oblique recession, and inferior oblique anterior transposition. Inferior oblique myectomy is a surgical procedure in which a portion of the inferior oblique muscle is removed to weaken its function. The inferior oblique recession technique used graded recession guidelines. The inferior oblique anterior transposition technique attaches the inferior oblique's insertion point 2 mm posterior to the point of inferior rectus insertion. Successful surgery was defined as ocular alignment within five prism diopters without diplopia symptoms. Three surgeons performed all surgeries during data collection.

### Retrospective analysis of factors related to the long-term recovery of third, fourth, and sixth cranial nerve palsy with etiologies and clinical course in a tertiary hospital [^114HGp7i]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Abducens nerve palsy was the most common palsy, and oculomotor nerve palsy had the shortest onset and recovery period. Complete recovery was associated with an onset of < 7 days and isolated cranial nerve palsy. Further research may identify additional factors influencing good outcomes, ultimately improving patient care and recovery prospects.

### Correlations between the clinical characteristics of diabetic trochlear nerve palsy and diplopia severity [^1158VGuw]. BMC Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Trochlear nerve palsy manifestation can be unilateral or bilateral, with unilateral involvement being more common. There is some debate whether the predominance exists among the involvement eyes. Described in the literature, the left eye is more frequently affected than the right eye in cases of unilateral trochlear nerve palsy. On the contrary, our study shows no predominance of eyes in diabetic trochlear nerve palsy patients. In addition, comparisons between the left and right eyes indicate that there is no difference in clinical indicators, which could be supportive to the result of no predominance. There are no definitive comparisons of results regarding diabetic ophthalmoplegia features between left and right eyes so far.

HbA1c, reflecting the average blood glucose level over the last three months, is a clinical indicator to evaluate glycemic control in diabetes mellitus patients. It is generally believed that DM patients with higher HbA1c value are more prone to ophthalmoplegia. Literature reported that high HbA1c value is an independent risk factor for the development of diabetic peripheral neuropathy. Mean HbA1c level of 6.5–7.0% is the critical cut-off to discriminate whether the diabetic peripheral neuropathy will develop or progress in T2DM patients. In other previous studies, HbA1c value is significantly higher in diabetic patients with ophthalmoplegia than normal DM patients. Poor glycemic control in diabetic patients predisposes them to diabetic ophthalmoplegia. However, in this study, we found no significant correlation between HbA1c values and the severity of diabetic trochlear nerve palsy (P = 0.295 > 0.05). One possible explanation would be that HbA1c value is a potential risk factor of DM complication occurrence, including ophthalmoplegia, while the severity of diplopia may vary depending on the response of the trochlea nerve and its innervated upper oblique muscle to the hyperglycemic microenvironment.

### Imaging of cranial nerves: a pictorial overview [^116CjesU]. Insights Into Imaging (2019). Medium credibility.

Ischemia

Ischemic lesions of the brainstem may cause isolated nerve palsies, more commonly in elderly population. Cranial nerves between the III and the VI are the most affected. Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) sequences are the best to visualize an acute ischemic lesion (Figs. 31 and 32), whereas FLAIR and T2-weighted sequences are useful to visualize subacute or old infarctions. The anatomical knowledge of the nuclei of the cranial nerves is fundamental to interpret ischemic nerve palsies.

### Isolated sixth cranial nerve palsy as the presenting symptom of a rapidly expanding ACTH positive pituitary adenoma: a case report [^116Pwixv]. BMC Ophthalmology (2011). Low credibility.

Conclusions

The cavernous sinus contains the carotid artery as well as the oculomotor, trochlear, ophthalmic and maxillary divisions of the trigeminal, and abducens nerves. Extraocular palsy generally indicates compression of the cavernous sinus wall or direct extension of the pituitary adenoma into the cavernous sinus. The incidence of ocular palsy occurring with pituitary tumors has been reported to be between 4.6 and 32%. Most commonly affected is the oculomotor nerve; rarely is the abducens nerve involved. A retrospective review of 64 patients hospitalized with pituitary adenoma found that a defect in ocular movement was present in 14% of patients, with oculomotor nerve involvement in 78% of cases. The sixth cranial nerve runs lateral to the internal carotid artery, but medial to the third, fourth, and first and second divisions of the fifth cranial nerves which run superior to inferior within the lateral dural border of the cavernous sinus. It is therefore more often spared because of its more sheltered position within the sinus. Our patient is unusual in that initially the sixth cranial nerve paresis was in isolation.

### Combined Brown syndrome and superior oblique palsy without a trochlear nerve: case report [^1159Trnt]. BMC Ophthalmology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Congenital Brown syndrome is characterized by limited elevation particularly during adduction from mechanical causes. The pathogenesis of congenital Brown syndrome is still controversial, and we have previously found normal-sized trochlear nerves and superior oblique (SO) muscles on high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in nine patients with congenital Brown syndrome. In contrast, Kaeser et al. reported an absent trochlear nerve with normal sized SO muscles, and Ellis et al. a hypoplastic SO in congenital Brown syndrome without confirming the status of the trochlear nerve, suggesting the etiology as a variant of congenital cranial dysinnervation disorders (CCDD). Recently we found a patient with limited elevation and depression during adduction suggesting congenital Brown syndrome with concurrent SO palsy in the same eye, who had no visible trochlear nerve on the ipsilateral side together with a hypoplastic SO confirmed by high-resolution MRI.

### Retrospective analysis of factors related to the long-term recovery of third, fourth, and sixth cranial nerve palsy with etiologies and clinical course in a tertiary hospital [^115xUWoH]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

Data Gathered

We conducted a search of outpatient and inpatient data using the following ICD-10 codes: H49.0 for oculomotor nerve palsy, H49.1 for trochlear nerve palsy, and H49.2 for abducens nerve palsy. The data gathered included patient sex, age, underlying condition, laterality, number of involvements, etiologies, symptoms, manifestation, onset, neuroimaging, recovery period, and surgical treatment. We initially extracted imaging parameters from official radiologic reports that were subsequently reviewed by a single neuroradiologist.

Statistical Analysis

We used descriptive statistics for the basic data on the sample group obtained from the general data. The group data were also analyzed in terms of the amount and percentage of quantitative data. For a normal distribution, the mean was measured along with the mean and standard deviation. For irregular distribution, the average value was summed with the median. Numbers and percentages represent clustered data. The two-proportion z-test is a statistical procedure used to compare the proportions of two independent groups.

We used logistic regression to estimate the independent factors associated with good recovery. The subjects were categorized into two age groups: younger (< 50 years) and older (≥ 50 years). The onset was classified as early (< 7 days) and late (≥ 7 days) clinical symptoms. In the multivariate logistic regression, we adjusted type of cranial nerve palsy, age at 50 years, sex, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, dyslipidemia, onset at 7 days, and number of cranial nerve involvement as potential factors for favorable outcomes.

The information was validated and recorded in a data file in the STATA/MP 12 program and then analyzed. We used SPSS for all statistical analyses. For all tests, p < 0.05 was considered significant.

### Correlations between the clinical characteristics of diabetic trochlear nerve palsy and diplopia severity [^111h4Vsy]. BMC Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Importance

Few literatures reported the clinical characteristics of diabetic trochlear nerve palsy, including demographic characteristics, involvement between both eyes, time of symptom onset, duration of diabetes, etc. Whether there is relevance between these data and the severity of diplopia deserves to be analyzed.

Objective

To clarify the clinical characteristics of diabetic trochlear nerve palsy patients and their correlation with the severity of diplopia.

Design, setting, and participants

Medical records of 609 isolated trochlear nerve palsy patients admitted to the Ocular Motility Disorder Treatment Centre of the First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University between December 2018 and October 2024 were reviewed and 92 eligible cases were enrolled in this study.

Main outcomes and measures

To evaluate the orientation and severity of diplopia, all patients were examined with neuroimaging, completed the computerized diplopia test and were assessed with the Ocular Motor Nerve Palsy Scale.

Results

Among the 92 patients aged 44 to 86 years (62.10 ± 8.04 years), the majority of the patients were male (n = 67, 73%)with no bilateral trochlear nerve palsy reported in all patients. The duration of diabetes ranged from 0.5 to 30 years (11.37 ± 8.02 years), and the time of symptom onset for all patients ranged from 2 to 111 days (14.68 ± 15.64 days). The average level of hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) was 8.02 ± 1.48(%) and the average maximum vertical deviation was 5.38° ± 2.18°. A significant correlation was found between the duration of diabetes and the severity of diplopia (P = 0.026) but other indicators were not. The duration of diabetes was an independent risk factor for the severity of diplopia (P = 0.035, OR = 1.004, 95% CI, 1.001–1.008).

Conclusions and relevance

This retrospective study suggests that the duration of diabetes plays an important role in diabetic trochlear nerve palsy and a longer duration of diabetes could lead to more severe diplopia in patients. Findings of this study may provide help for clinical treatment and prognosis.

### Absence of the trochlear nerve in patients with superior oblique hypoplasia [^1177wJ16]. Ophthalmology (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

Congenital cranial dysinnervation disorders (CCDDs) are developmental abnormalities involving the hypoplasia or aplasia of the cranial nerves with muscle dysinnervation. This study aimed to determine if congenital superior oblique palsy with superior oblique hypoplasia also can be classified as a CCDD.

Design

Observational case series.

Participants

Ten patients with superior oblique hypoplasia.

Methods

Ophthalmologic examination and thin-section magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at the brainstem level as well as across the orbit were performed in 10 patients with superior oblique hypoplasia. To confirm the accuracy of the procedure, the results obtained were compared with those of a control group comprising 12 children by using the same technique.

Main Outcome Measures

Examination of ductions and versions, 3-step test, angle of deviation, and presence of the trochlear nerve and superior oblique hypoplasia on MRI.

Results

Trochlear nerve was absent on the affected side in 10 patients with confirmed hypoplastic superior oblique muscles. The trochlear nerves as well as normal-sized superior oblique muscles were observed in 24 (100%) of 24 eyes screened as controls.

Conclusions

Congenital superior oblique palsy with superior oblique hypoplasia also can be classified as a CCDD by the MRI documentation of congenital aplasia of the trochlear nerve.

### Prognostic factors for successful surgical outcomes in trochlear nerve palsy: a retrospective study and literature review [^114WAwLR]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Limitations

Notably, our study had some limitations. First, its retrospective design carried a risk of selection bias and incomplete data. Second, the small sample size might have reduced our analysis's statistical power, potentially affecting our findings' robustness. Third, as this was a single-center study, the results might not be generalizable to broader populations. Fourth, the follow-up period was limited, potentially overlooking long-term or delayed outcomes. Finally, the absence of a control group restricted our ability to compare surgical outcomes with alternative treatment modalities, including nonsurgical interventions and other surgical techniques. Future multicenter prospective studies with larger sample sizes and longer follow-up periods are warranted to validate our findings.

### Etiological distribution of isolated oculomotor nerve palsy: analysis of 633 patients and literature review [^115XSLLe]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Comparison with isolated trochlear and abducens nerve palsy

The etiological distribution of isolated oculomotor nerve palsy also differed from those isolated trochlear and abducens nerve palsies in our study cohort (p < 0.001, Figure 6a). The proportion of microvascular etiology was higher in isolated abducens nerve palsy (oculomotor vs. trochlear vs. abducens; 26.5% vs. 20.8% vs. 36.7%) whilst those of idiopathic (9.5% vs. 25.1% vs. 17.7%), congenital (4.1% vs. 32.4% vs. 1.2%) and traumatic (8.4% vs. 14.2% vs. 4.3%) etiology were higher in isolated trochlear palsy, and vascular anomalies (17.4% vs. 1.3% vs. 10.2%) were higher in isolated oculomotor nerve palsy. Patients with oculomotor nerve palsy more frequently visited the emergency department first than those with isolated trochlear or abducens nerve palsy (42.5% vs. 17.8% vs. 30.1%, p < 0.001; Figure 6b). The proportion of involved specialties also differed amongst the groups (p < 0.001, Figure 6c).

FIGURE 6
Comparison of the characteristics with isolated trochlear and abducens nerve palsy. (a) The etiological distribution of isolated oculomotor nerve palsy differed from those of isolated trochlear and abducens nerve palsies in the same cohort reported previously (p < 0.001). (b) Patients with isolated oculomotor nerve palsy more frequently visited the emergency department first than trochlear or abducens nerve palsy (p < 0.001). (c) The proportion of involved specialties differed amongst the isolated ocular motor nerve palsies. For all three nerve palsies, the ophthalmologists were mostly involved in the management, especially for trochlear nerve palsy. In contrast, the neurologists were more frequently involved in the care of oculomotor and abducens nerve palsies than trochlear palsy.

### Imaging the ocular motor nerves [^115B13hN]. European Journal of Radiology (2010). Low credibility.

The ocular motor nerves (OMNs) comprise the oculomotor, trochlear and the abducens nerves. According to their course, they are divided into four or five anatomic segments: intra-axial, cisternal, cavernous and intra-orbital and, for the abducens nerve, an additional interdural segment. Magnetic resonance imaging is the imaging method of choice in the evaluation of the normal and pathologic ocular motor nerves. CT still plays a limited but important role in the evaluation of the intraosseous portions at the skull base and bony foramina. We describe for each segment of these cranial nerves, the normal anatomy, the most appropriate image sequences and planes, their imaging appearance and pathologic conditions. Magnetic resonance imaging with high magnetic fields is a developing and promising technique. We describe our initial experience with a Phillips 7.0T MRI scanner in the evaluation of the brainstem segments of the OMNs. As imaging becomes more refined, an understanding of the detailed anatomy is increasingly necessary, as the demand on radiology to diagnose smaller lesions also increases.

### Percutaneous radiofrequency treatment of the gasserian ganglion for trigeminal neuralgia complicated by trochlear nerve palsy: a case report [^1116YLLs]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Preprocedural imaging has become standard practice, ensuring clinicians of knowledge of a patient's anatomy. Preprocedural MRI has an important role in finding the cause of TN and may detect anatomical variations important to consider when planning invasive procedures. However, a certain level of imprecision or ambiguity is inherent to imaging studies as the trigeminal complex and Meckel's cave are relatively small anatomical structures and can usually only be partially visualized. The postprocedural diagnosis of an arteriovenous malformation in a patient with CN4 palsy after percutaneous balloon compression demonstrates this imprecision and illustrates that preprocedural MRI is unable to prevent all cases of CN palsy.

The trochlear nerve has the longest intracranial course of all CNs and is the only one to originate from the dorsal midbrain. It decussates in the superior medullary velum, transverses the brain and enters the cavernous sinus to terminate on the superior oblique muscle. The decussating path of the trochlear nerve allowed the conclusion that the trochlear nerve, not the trochlear nucleus, was injured in this case history. The cavernous sinus is a dural envelope that contains not only CN4, but also CN3 and CN6. Its boneless makeup and close relation to Meckel's cave may play a role in the mechanism underlying CN paralysis after RF-G.

Various mechanisms for CN injury have been postulated, of which the most prominent is incorrect procedural technique. The proximity of the trigeminal complex to the different CNs warrants extreme caution, as minute displacement of the cannula in either depth or direction may lead to complications. The application of fluoroscopy enables real-time needle visualization and is thought to be crucial to minimize the incidence of adverse events.

Different authors hypothesize that the origin of CN palsy is equipment-related, that is, insertion too far into Meckel's cave, pertaining to cannula design, or overinflation in the setting of balloon compression. Other mentioned causes of CN damage are anatomical variations and secondary heat injury originating from the outward radiation of thermal energy from the target site.

We propose a novel explanation and hypothesize that procedure-related hemorrhage might lead to compression and injury of CNs. We found enhanced postprocedural magnetic resonance signaling in this patient and presume this to be a reflection of hematoma. Hemorrhage might be the causative mechanism for CN4 palsy in this case, but other explanations could be (undetected) anatomical variations or secondary heat injury.

### Combined Brown syndrome and superior oblique palsy without a trochlear nerve: case report [^115mGi2n]. BMC Ophthalmology (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Congenital Brown syndrome may be associated with an absent trochlear nerve and SO hypoplasia suggesting an etiologic mechanism of CCDD.

### Congenital superior oblique palsy and trochlear nerve absence: a clinical and radiological study [^115exkA8]. Ophthalmology (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate patients with congenital superior oblique palsy (SOP) by classifying them according to their magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings and cross-comparing the clinical characteristics of each group.

Design

Retrospective, observational study.

Participants

Ninety-seven consecutive patients diagnosed with congenital SOP.

Methods

Medical records of patients who demonstrated typical signs of congenital SOP were reviewed. The presence or absence of the trochlear nerve was visualized with thin-section high-resolution MRI of the cranial nerves.

Main Outcome Measures

Presence of the trochlear nerve and superior oblique (SO) muscle hypoplasia on MRI, age at the onset of symptoms or signs, ocular motility examination results, objective ocular torsion, and surgical outcomes.

Results

Of the 97 patients with congenital SOP, 73% of patients were identified with an ipsilateral absent trochlear nerve and variable degree of SO muscle hypoplasia (absent group), whereas the remaining 27% had a normal trochlear nerve and normal symmetric SO muscle (present group). Patients with an absent trochlear nerve showed more frequent head tilt (P = 0.030) that was manifest at an earlier onset before 1 year of age (P < 0.001). Patients with a normal trochlear nerve had a more prominent overelevation in adduction (P = 0.008) and more frequently were associated with dissociated vertical deviation (DVD; P = 0.025).

Conclusions

Congenital SOP patients without a trochlear nerve had a hypoplastic SO muscle and frequently manifested head tilt at an earlier age, whereas patients with a normal trochlear nerve showed prominent overelevation in adduction and frequent DVD.

### Retrospective analysis of factors related to the long-term recovery of third, fourth, and sixth cranial nerve palsy with etiologies and clinical course in a tertiary hospital [^113Pnmvz]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

Etiologies Correlation with Recovery Rate

Among the various etiologies of nerve palsy, our study showed that inflammation had the best recovery rate in oculomotor nerve palsy as shown in Table 2, patients experiencing ischemic events had the best recovery in trochlear nerve palsy and trauma in abducens nerve palsy. Among the groups, the two proportions revealed traumatic causes in trochlear nerve palsy, which had a statistically significant difference compared with abducens nerve (p = 0.00). Comparatively, there was a considerable difference in idiopathic etiology between trochlear nerve palsy and oculomotor and abducens nerve, with p values of 0.001 and 0.026, respectively.

Table 2
Recovery Rates by Etiology

As shown in Table 3, we combined the three nerve palsy groups for logistic regression analysis. Our study revealed that an early onset of < 7 days and isolated cranial nerve palsy were significantly associated with complete recovery at an adjusted odds ratio of 1.73 (95% confidence interval, 1.03–2.89) and 2.56 (95% confidence interval, 1.21–5.39), respectively.

### Lifetime risk, sex and age differences in annual incidence of ocular motor cranial nerve palsy in Japan for 2019 [^112U1ihb]. Communications Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

This nationwide population-based cohort study captures a comprehensive demographic profile of ocular motor cranial nerve palsy, including oculomotor, trochlear, and abducens palsies, which induce paralytic strabismus with subsequent binocular vision disorders. The annual incidence rates of oculomotor, trochlear, and abducens palsies are 6.62, 2.61, and 8.14 per 100,000 person-years. The incidence rate is observed to increase with age and to be higher in men than in women (19.91 vs. 14.96). The lifetime risks of oculomotor, trochlear, and abducens palsies are 0.50%, 0.19%, and 0.61%, respectively. Our results provide important information for addressing healthcare, particularly for older people, from social and public health perspectives.
