## Question

Can agitation occur in cld?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether agitation can occur in chronic liver disease and how to understand and manage it. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the neuropsychiatric complications of chronic liver disease, especially hepatic encephalopathy, and whether agitation is part of that spectrum. Then, I should verify the pathophysiology that would plausibly produce agitation. Next, I will review clinical evidence and case descriptions that explicitly mention agitation in cirrhosis. After that, I need to distinguish agitation due to hepatic encephalopathy from other common causes in liver disease, such as alcohol withdrawal, medication effects, and delirium. Finally, I should consider how to grade severity, identify precipitating factors, and outline safe, evidence-based management, including pharmacologic choices and monitoring considerations.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entity. Hepatic encephalopathy is a frequent, prognostically important neuropsychiatric syndrome in chronic liver disease and cirrhosis, with manifestations ranging from minimal HE to overt HE with disorientation, confusion, and coma. Importantly, agitation is described among overt symptoms in more severe presentations, which directly links agitation to CLD via HE [^113BQ3jf] [^113r3LNZ] [^112jueZv].

> I need to check the pathophysiology that would plausibly cause agitation. HE reflects multifactorial brain dysfunction driven by ammonia, inflammatory cytokines, GABA–benzodiazepine receptor interactions, and low-grade cerebral edema; these mechanisms can impair arousal and behavior, and in hyperactive delirium phenotypes of HE, agitation emerges as a prominent outward sign of neurocortical dysfunction in cirrhosis [^113BQ3jf] [^113r3LNZ] [^111V3QG3].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — I should verify direct clinical mentions of agitation. Multiple sources explicitly note agitation in overt HE: consensus statements describe patients becoming disoriented, acutely confused, and suffering from agitation or coma. A recent case report details psychomotor agitation during decompensated cirrhosis with elevated ammonia. And acute liver failure literature notes agitation as an early manifestation of cerebral edema and encephalopathy, reinforcing that agitation is a recognized feature across the HE spectrum in liver disease [^112jueZv] [^115XQ9MY] [^111tjQVp].

> But wait, what if the agitation is not from HE itself? I should double-check the differential. In alcohol-related liver disease, alcohol withdrawal delirium commonly presents with agitation and requires benzodiazepines, yet benzodiazepines can precipitate or worsen HE; medications such as H2 antagonists and others can cause delirium with agitation; and sepsis, GI bleeding, electrolyte disturbances, and renal dysfunction frequently precipitate HE and can independently produce delirium with agitation, so I need to ensure I'm not attributing agitation solely to HE when another cause is present [^117SxCrZ] [^116Qai9h] [^113TpwTt] [^113sHnmu].

> Next, I should review how we grade severity and why that matters for agitation. The West Haven Criteria remain the clinical standard, with agitation mapping to higher grades of overt HE; in parallel, tools like the Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale are used in hospitalized patients to quantify agitation and guide sedation decisions, which is particularly relevant when managing dangerous hyperactive delirium in cirrhosis [^114GRu2Q].

> I will now examine precipitating factors because agitation in HE is often triggered. Infections, GI bleeding, acute kidney injury, constipation, diuretic excess, and sedatives are common precipitants; nearly all episodic HE cases have identifiable precipitants, and correcting them is the cornerstone of management, so I need to actively search for and treat these drivers when agitation appears [^113TpwTt] [^111x99Nj] [^117CEL1w].

> Let me think about immediate management when agitation threatens safety. First, secure the airway and consider ICU-level care for severe HE with agitation. Second, start empiric HE therapy with lactulose to reduce ammonia absorption, using nasogastric or rectal routes if needed. Third, add rifaximin to lactulose to lower recurrence risk. Fourth, identify and treat precipitating factors aggressively. And fifth, avoid or minimize benzodiazepines outside of alcohol withdrawal contexts because they can worsen HE, favoring short-acting agents with less hepatic metabolism if sedation is absolutely necessary [^111f2sog] [^117NP6Mb] [^115mv36t] [^113TpwTt].

> Wait, I should verify pharmacologic choices for chemical restraint when agitation is dangerous. Haloperidol is often recommended as a relatively safer antipsychotic for severe agitation in cirrhosis, but I need to monitor for QT prolongation and extrapyramidal effects; second-generation antipsychotics like risperidone or quetiapine may be alternatives, yet all antipsychotics can lower seizure threshold and should be used at the lowest effective dose with close monitoring in this high-risk population [^1172SD8u] [^116Qai9h].

> Hold on, I should verify a potential pitfall: flumazenil. Flumazenil can transiently improve mental status in some HE patients, but it does not improve survival and can precipitate withdrawal or seizures in benzodiazepine-dependent patients; therefore, it is not recommended for routine HE management and should be reserved for carefully selected scenarios with caution in cirrhosis [^116DidJ1] [^116L3S68] [^115bH5mC].

> Let me reconsider supportive measures that reduce recurrence and improve outcomes. After an episode of overt HE with agitation, discharge planning should confirm neurologic status, ensure adherence to lactulose and consider rifaximin to reduce recurrence, and educate caregivers that mental status may fluctuate. Systematic identification and treatment of precipitants, along with structured follow-up, reduce readmissions and recurrence risk [^111RhfVz] [^115mv36t] [^116VZBsx].

> In summary, I should confirm the bottom line. Yes, agitation can occur in chronic liver disease, most characteristically as a manifestation of overt hepatic encephalopathy in the setting of cirrhosis, driven by ammonia, inflammation, and neurotransmitter disturbances. However, I need to actively exclude alternative causes such as alcohol withdrawal, medication-induced delirium, and sepsis, and then manage with airway protection when needed, lactulose plus rifaximin, rigorous correction of precipitating factors, and judicious use of antipsychotics for dangerous agitation while avoiding benzodiazepines outside of withdrawal protocols [^113BQ3jf] [^113r3LNZ] [^113TpwTt] [^111f2sog].

Agitation is common in chronic liver disease (CLD), especially in hepatic encephalopathy (HE) [^112jueZv], and is typically driven by **elevated ammonia**, **inflammation**, and **neurotransmitter imbalance** [^113r3LNZ]. It presents as restlessness, irritability, and confusion, and is often triggered by infection, GI bleeding, electrolyte disturbances, or sedatives [^113TpwTt]. Management centers on **identifying and treating precipitating factors** [^114mYMnp], using lactulose and rifaximin to reduce ammonia [^1172SD8u] [^115mv36t], and avoiding benzodiazepines; haloperidol is preferred if sedation is needed [^1172SD8u]. Agitation in CLD signals **worse prognosis** and higher mortality, so early recognition and targeted therapy are essential [^113BQ3jf].

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms of agitation in CLD

Agitation in CLD arises from **complex interactions** among ammonia toxicity, systemic inflammation, and neurotransmitter imbalance [^notfound]:

- **Ammonia toxicity**: Elevated ammonia crosses the blood-brain barrier, causing astrocyte swelling and cerebral edema, leading to neuropsychiatric symptoms, including agitation [^notfound].

- **Inflammation**: Systemic inflammation from CLD exacerbates neuroinflammation, worsening agitation and cognitive impairment [^notfound].

- **Neurotransmitter imbalance**: CLD alters GABA, glutamate, and serotonin systems, contributing to agitation and behavioral changes [^notfound].

---

## Clinical presentation of agitation in CLD

Agitation in CLD **manifests as**:

- **Restlessness and irritability**: Common early signs of HE-related agitation [^115zXbtN].

- **Confusion and disorientation**: Patients may exhibit impaired attention, memory, and executive function [^113DynkP].

- **Behavioral changes**: Aggression, anxiety, and emotional lability are frequent [^115zXbtN].

- **Physical signs**: Asterixis, tremor, and hyperreflexia may accompany agitation [^115zXbtN].

---

## Precipitating factors for agitation in CLD

Several factors can **trigger or worsen agitation** in CLD:

| **Precipitating factor** | **Mechanism** |
|-|-|
| Infections (e.g. SBP, UTI) | Increased ammonia production and systemic inflammation [^113TpwTt] |
| Gastrointestinal bleeding | Protein load increasing ammonia absorption [^113TpwTt] |
| Electrolyte disturbances (hyponatremia, hypokalemia) | Neurotransmitter imbalance and cerebral edema [^112nFKRB] |
| Sedative medications (benzodiazepines, opioids) | Direct CNS depression and neurotransmitter modulation [^113TpwTt] |
| Alcohol withdrawal | Autonomic hyperactivity and neurotransmitter imbalance [^111SEay8] |

---

## Diagnostic approach to agitation in CLD

Diagnosing agitation in CLD requires a **comprehensive evaluation**:

- **Clinical assessment**: Use the West Haven Criteria to grade HE severity and identify agitation-related symptoms [^114GRu2Q].

- **Laboratory tests**: Measure ammonia levels, electrolytes, renal function, and screen for infections [^113TpwTt].

- **Neuroimaging**: MRI or CT may be needed to exclude intracranial pathology or cerebral edema [^113TWr7T].

- **Differential diagnosis**: Exclude other causes of agitation, such as alcohol withdrawal, medication effects, or primary psychiatric disorders [^113sHnmu].

---

## Management strategies for agitation in CLD

Effective management of agitation in CLD centers on **addressing precipitating factors** and using targeted pharmacologic therapy:

- **Identify and treat precipitating factors**: Infections, GI bleeding, electrolyte disturbances, and medication adjustments are critical [^113TpwTt].

- **Pharmacologic management**: Lactulose and rifaximin reduce ammonia absorption and recurrence of HE-related agitation [^117NP6Mb] [^115mv36t].

- **Sedation**: Avoid benzodiazepines; haloperidol is preferred for severe agitation due to lower risk of exacerbating HE [^1172SD8u].

- **Supportive care**: Provide a calm environment, ensure patient safety, and monitor closely for complications [^115T6DuK].

---

## Prognostic implications of agitation in CLD

Agitation in CLD is associated with **increased mortality**, frequent hospitalizations, and substantial caregiver burden. Persistent agitation indicates advanced liver disease and poor prognosis, underscoring the need for early intervention and palliative care planning [^112jueZv] [^113vhuFC].

---

Agitation is a common and significant symptom in CLD, primarily due to hepatic encephalopathy. It reflects underlying metabolic and neurotransmitter disturbances and is often triggered by infections, bleeding, or medication use. Effective management requires identifying and treating precipitating factors, using ammonia-lowering therapies, and avoiding sedatives that worsen encephalopathy. Agitation in CLD signals **advanced disease** and **poor prognosis**, necessitating comprehensive care and palliative planning.

To the Editor. — Hypothyroidism in the adult has been characterized clinically by cold intolerance, lethargy, constipation, and overall slowing of intellectual and motor activities. Conversely, classic clinical hyperthyroidism has been recognized by heat intolerance, palpitations, hyperkinesis, and emotional lability. A less classic presentation can occur in elderly patients with hyperthyroidism who have been described as "masked" or "apathetic" hyperthyroid patients. 1 The patient described herein became hypothyroid after discontinuation of replacement therapy. Her clinical presentation was noted by symptoms of heat intolerance, agitation, insomnia, and nervous irritability, which improved as she became euthyroid.

Of the clinical complications of cirrhosis, hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is the most devastating. HE is a spectrum of reversible cognitive changes ranging from minimal HE (MHE) (mild inattention and deficits of executive function) to overt HE (disorientation to coma). More than 40% of patients with cirrhosis develop HE, which increases mortality, falls, motor vehicle accidents, and has a significant psychosocial impact. 1 Early recognition is crucial. Patients with cirrhosis are recommended to receive an assessment for MHE. 2.

AASLD — cannabinoids for nausea and vomiting in decompensated cirrhosis (DC) emphasizes limited evidence and cautions. Cannabinoids are another potential treatment for nausea and vomiting, and one meta-analysis found cannabinoids were associated with a reduction of nausea and vomiting of > 50%, although data in cirrhosis are limited. Adverse effects in the general population include dizziness, dry mouth, nausea, fatigue, somnolence, euphoria, vomiting, disorientation, drowsiness, confusion, loss of balance, and hallucination. Observational studies report both associations with accelerated hepatic fibrosis, encephalopathy, and ascites in chronic liver disease due to HCV and fatty liver disease, and other studies including two meta-analyses did not find a significant association between cannabis and hepatic fibrosis. Trials have generally excluded patients with cirrhosis; thus, cannabinoids should be used with caution and with attention to institutional protocols for its use, and edible formulations are favored over inhaled because of the potential infectious and respiratory effects of smoking.

### Nursing care of patients with cirrhosis: the liverHope nursing project [^114T7bnN]. Hepatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Hepatic Encephalopathy

HE is characterized by neuropsychiatric symptoms including disorientation, inappropriate behavior, sleep disturbances, abnormalities in speech, and alterations in consciousness that may progress to coma. 22, 23 In the most common form of HE, known as "overt HE", symptoms may appear rapidly, in a matter of hours, are frequently related to a precipitating factor, and resolve spontaneously or with treatment. In some patients, however, symptoms are constant, not related to a precipitating factor, and do not disappear with therapy. This form is known as "persistent HE". Finally, there is a third form, known as "covert HE", in which patients have only subtle alterations in their mental status, but sufficient to alter certain activities that require great attention, such as intellectual activities or driving a vehicle.

HE occurs because substances present in the gut with the capacity to interfere with neuronal function, such as ammonia, bypass the liver and reach the brain due to the presence of shunts between the portal territory and systemic circulation, and hepatic dysfunction. 22, 23 HE commonly occurs as a result of a precipitating event, particularly bacterial infections, GI bleeding, or acute kidney injury, which cause a further impairment in already impaired brain function associated with advanced cirrhosis. HE is very common in patients with advanced cirrhosis and is one of the most dreaded complications, because neuropsychological alterations impact very negatively on patients' quality of life, and because the occurrence of HE bears very poor prognostic significance. Moreover, recurrence of overt HE is frequent and represents a major cause of hospital admission and readmission. Consequently, HE represents a heavy burden to the caregivers and families.

Table 4. Differential diagnosis of hepatic encephalopathy (HE) — The differential diagnosis should include common disorders altering consciousness and precipitating factors. Examples listed are diabetic metabolic derangements, alcohol intoxication/withdrawal/Wernicke, drugs (benzodiazepines, neuroleptics, opioids), electrolyte disorders (hyponatremia and hypercalcemia), nonconvulsive epilepsy, psychiatric disorders, intracranial bleeding and stroke, severe medical stress, dementia, brain lesions, and obstructive sleep apnea. The recognition of precipitating factors for HE supports the diagnosis, and hyponatremia and sepsis can both produce encephalopathy per se and precipitate HE; in end-stage liver disease, uremic encephalopathy and HE may overlap.

The term acute liver failure (ALF) is frequently applied as a generic expression to describe patients presenting with or developing an acute episode of liver dysfunction. In the context of hepatological practice, however, ALF refers to a highly specific and rare syndrome, characterised by an acute abnormality of liver blood tests in an individual without underlying chronic liver disease. The disease process is associated with development of a coagulopathy of liver aetiology, and clinically apparent altered level of consciousness due to hepatic encephalopathy. Several important measures are immediately necessary when the patient presents for medical attention. These, as well as additional clinical procedures will be the subject of these clinical practice guidelines.

### Evidence-based consensus guidelines for the management of catatonia: recommendations from the British Association for Psychopharmacology [^111gg8LE]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Medium credibility.

Recommendations for catatonia in autism spectrum disorder

Clinical vigilance is warranted for the assessment of catatonia in autism spectrum disorder given its high prevalence. (C)
Diagnosis of catatonia in autism spectrum disorder requires a marked change from baseline presentation. (S)
First-line interventions in mild cases of catatonia are psychological interventions and/or lorazepam, but the standard treatments for catatonia (i.e. benzodiazepines in escalating dosages and/or bilateral ECT) should be considered in moderate to severe cases. (D)

Medical conditions

Considerations in kidney disease

Catatonia, including malignant catatonia, has been described in the context of severe renal impairment, in patients receiving dialysis and in the post-transplantation period, often as a result of drug toxicities. Patients with renal impairment, even those on dialysis, may still be able to tolerate and benefit from benzodiazepines with consideration of the severity of renal impairment, route of administration of benzodiazepines, comorbidities (e.g. frailty), including the risk for delirium.

Typically, no dose adjustments are required even in severe impairment for acute dosing of lorazepam in either oral or parenteral formulation; however, for high or repeated parenteral dosing, monitoring for propylene glycol toxicity and consideration of other therapies such as ECT and NMDA receptor antagonists may be indicated to lessen the impact of the potential side effects of treatment (e.g. falls, confusion, delirium).

Considerations in liver disease

Malignant catatonia may be a rare cause of liver failure. Catatonia has been reported secondary to Wilson's disease, after liver transplantation, including in post-transplantation delirium as well as secondary to post-transplantation drug toxicities. The early post-liver transplantation period may be a state of deficiency in GABA signalling, which may place the patient at increased risk for catatonia.

Benzodiazepines may be an effective treatment for catatonia post-transplantation. In mild to moderate hepatic impairment, typically no dose adjustment for lorazepam is required (oral or parenteral formulations). In severe impairment or failure, use caution. Other treatments such as NMDA receptor antagonists or ECT may be required when benzodiazepine treatment is cautioned.

### Hepatic encephalopathy in chronic liver disease: 2014 practice guideline by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and the European Association for the Study of the Liver [^115FyhmU]. Hepatology (2014). Medium credibility.

Covert and overt hepatic encephalopathy therapy evidence — The majority of studies have been for less than 6 months and do not reflect the overall course of the condition, and trials span the gamut from small open-label trials to larger, randomized, controlled studies using treatments varying from probiotics, lactulose, and rifaximin. It was shown, in an open-label study, that lactulose can prevent development of the first episode of OHE, but the study needs to be replicated in a larger study in a blinded fashion before firm recommendations can be made. Studies using lactulose and rifaximin have shown improvement in quality of life and driving simulator performance, while probiotics have also been used but remain difficult to recommend as therapeutic options at this time due to open-label designs, varying organisms, and different outcomes.

### Benzodiazepine receptor antagonists for acute and chronic hepatic encephalopathy [^116DidJ1]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

Background

The pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy is unknown. It has been suggested that liver failure leads to the accumulation of substances that bind to a receptor-complex in the brain resulting in neural inhibition which may progress to coma. Several trials have assessed benzodiazepine receptor antagonists for hepatic encephalopathy, but the results are conflicting.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of benzodiazepine receptor antagonists for patients with acute or chronic hepatic encephalopathy.

Search Strategy

Eligible trials were identified through The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, The Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, MEDLINE, EMBASE, reference lists of relevant articles, authors of trials, and the pharmaceutical company known to produce benzodiazepine receptor antagonists.

Selection Criteria

Randomised trials comparing any benzodiazepine receptor antagonist versus placebo or no intervention for hepatic encephalopathy were included, regardless of language or publication status.

Data Collection and Analysis

Trial inclusion and data extraction were made independently by two contributors. Depending on the presence or absence of significant heterogeneity (P < 0.1) a random or fixed effect model was used. Potential causes for heterogeneity were explored by sensitivity analyses.

Main Results

Twelve randomised trials with 765 patients were included. Eight trials used a crossover design. All trials were double-blind and assessed flumazenil versus placebo. Data on all outcomes could not be extracted from all trials. The included patients had a favourable prognosis (341/370 (92%) survived in the flumazenil group versus 325/356 (91%) in the placebo group). Flumazenil had no significant effect on full recovery (two trials), survival (nine trials), or on the occurrence of adverse events (five trials). However, flumazenil was associated with a significant effect on improvement of hepatic encephalopathy compared to placebo at the end of treatment (103/346 (30%) versus 23/332 (7%), risk difference 0.23, 95% confidence interval 0.18 to 0.28, five trials).

Reviewer's Conclusions

Flumazenil had no significant effect on recovery or survival from hepatic encephalopathy. However, flumazenil had a significant effect on short-term improvement of hepatic encephalopathy in some patients with chronic liver disease and a highly favourable prognosis. Considering the fluctuating nature of hepatic encephalopathy, future trials should use a parallel design and assess if treatment with flumazenil leads to a sustained improvement or increased recovery and survival. Until this has been demonstrated, flumazenil may be considered for patients with chronic liver disease and hepatic encephalopathy, but cannot be recommended for routine clinical use.

### AASLD practice guidance on acute-on-chronic liver failure and the management of critically ill patients with cirrhosis [^111f2sog]. Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) management in critically ill cirrhosis — if no obvious alternative cause is immediately apparent, empiric therapy with lactulose should be started, with a nasogastric tube used if needed and oral lactulose held in ileus; in those with Grade 3 or 4 HE, a lactulose enema (300 mL lactulose in 700 mL water for a total of 1 L) may be considered, and regardless of route the goal is improved mental status with careful electrolyte monitoring; in patients without acute kidney injury (AKI) who are critically ill, treatment includes lactulose (orally or rectally) or polyethylene glycol if at risk of ileus/abdominal distention, the role of rifaximin as an add-on to lactulose/polyethylene glycol warrants further investigation in ACLF, and the role of rifaximin and i.v. albumin in the acute setting remains unclear; polyethylene glycol has been studied with success compared with lactulose and maybe an alternative, especially to decrease the risk of ileus/abdominal compartment syndrome in the ICU setting; ammonia scavengers such as L-ornithine L-aspartate and ornithine phenylacetate are not available in the United States and are undergoing further trials; medications with short half-lives (e.g., propofol, dexmedetomidine) should be used for sedation and pain control in patients with cirrhosis who require intubation and mechanical ventilation.

### Hepatitis C virus manipulates humans as its favorite host for a long-term relationship [^114N3CJ7]. Hepatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection-associated liver disease is a global health problem. HCV often causes silent disease, and eventually progresses to end-stage liver disease. HCV infects hepatocytes; however, initial manifestation of liver disease is mostly displayed in hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), causing fibrosis/cirrhosis, and is believed to occur from inflammation in the liver. It remains unclear why HCV is not spontaneously cleared from infected liver in the majority of individuals and develops chronic infection with progressive liver disease. Direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) show excellent results in controlling viremia, although beneficial consequence in advanced liver disease remains to be understood. In this review, we highlight the current knowledge that has contributed to our understanding of the role of HCV in inflammation, immune evasion, metabolic disorders, liver pathogeneses, and efforts in vaccine development.

### Experiences of individuals who were physically restrained in the emergency department… [^114VnmqY]. JAMA Network (2020). Excellent credibility.

Visits to the emergency department related to behavioral disorders are rapidly increasing in the United States, 1 with 1. 7 million episodes of associated patient agitation occurring annually in emergency settings. 2 A recent study performed at a large urban county health care facility3 estimated that agitation was associated with 2. 6% of all ED visits. Unfortunately, treatment of these agitation episodes may lead to potential harm among patients. When deescalation attempts fail, ED staff commonly use physical restraints, which are associated with lasting physical injuries and cardiac arrest. 4–6 Efforts to reduce threats to patient safety during agitation management have led to calls for early detection and intervention to prevent escalating agitation and to minimize the use of restraints.
7. However, use of deescalation is often challenging in the emergency setting, where the acuity of agitation may be higher and the nature of patient presentations is more varied.

8 Behavioral techniques rely on building a strong rapport and therapeutic relationship with the patient, but ED staff have reported that their insight into patients' perspectives during. agitation events is very limited. 9 This is compounded by the fact that agitated patients may often experience coercion, defined as actions performed on a patient that cause loss of self-determination, ranging from involuntary detention or seclusion to use of forcible treatment with restraints. 10 A recent observational study11 found that 61% of agitated patients felt coerced by police or prehospital staff before ED arrival. Experiences of coercion may limit the ability of ED clinical staff to engage in a dialogue and create a therapeutic bond.
12. Unfortunately, studies that are drawn directly from the perceptions and experiences of patients who experienced agitation episodes in the ED are rare.

Having a better understanding of patient wishes during and experiences of ED agitation care may assist staff in practicing the use of noncoercive techniques at the bedside. This study aimed to explore the experiences, backgrounds, and health care system interactions of individuals who were physically restrained during an ED visit. In giving these patients a voice, we hope to inform future research, policy, and clinical practice for the use of restraints and management of agitation in the ED. Recent studies examining the experiences of ED health workers during the management of agitation have begun to shed light on potential reasons for our patients' descriptions of their restraint experiences.

### Tremors and agitation following low-dose intravenous hydromorphone administration in a patient with kidney dysfunction [^111RAwjQ]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To report a case of tremors and agitation associated with the administration of low doses of intravenous hydromorphone in a patient with acute kidney injury in the setting of chronic kidney disease.

Case Summary

A 91-year-old man was admitted for a left intertrochanteric hip fracture. On hospital days 1 and 2, the patient received hydromorphone 1 mg intravenously for pain. By hospital day 3, the patient had received a total of 3.5 mg of hydromorphone. He then became tremulous and agitated, which worsened as the dose was increased. During hospital day 4, the hydromorphone dosage was increased to 0.5 mg intravenously every 4 hours for what was perceived to be inadequate pain control, manifesting as tremors and agitation. On hospital day 5, hydromorphone, now considered a potential cause of the tremors and agitation, was discontinued. The total amount of hydromorphone administered was 8 mg over 5 days. By hospital day 6, the tremors and agitation had decreased in severity and had resolved by hospital day 7.

Discussion

Previous reports suggest that hydromorphone-induced neurotoxicity is more likely to occur following high doses over extended periods, especially in patients with kidney dysfunction. There is a paucity of evidence suggesting that neurotoxicity can occur following low doses for short periods of time. Morphine-3-glucuronide has neuroexcitatory properties including myoclonus, allodynia, agitation, or tremors. Structural similarities between morphine-3-glucuronide and hydromorphone-3-glucuronide suggest that neuroexcitatory effects with hydromorphone are feasible. The Naranjo probability scale indicated that hydromorphone-induced tremors were possible. Our case is distinct because the patient received low doses of hydromorphone over a short period.

Conclusions

Neurotoxicity can occur in patients with kidney dysfunction while they receive low doses of intravenous hydromorphone over short periods. Diligent monitoring and reporting of such effects are necessary to better understand risk factors and a mechanism.

### Hepatic encephalopathy [^113BQ3jf]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2016). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on hepatic encephalopathy:

- **Definition**: HE is a reversible neuropsychiatric abnormality found in patients with chronic liver disease and/or portosystemic shunting.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of HE is multifactorial and involves agents such as ammonia, inflammatory cytokines, manganese deposition in the basal ganglia, and benzodiazepine-like compounds. Fecal microbiota and aromatic amino acids also play a role.
- **Epidemiology**: In the US, the incidence of hospital admission for HE is approximately 30 cases per 100,000 person-years. In patients with decompensated cirrhosis, the prevalence of HE is up to 20%.
- **Disease course**: HE is associated with clinical manifestations of neuronal dysfunction (delirium, seizures). If untreated, severe HE may result in brain edema, coma, and death.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The in-hospital mortality of patients with HE is estimated at 14.1–15.6%. Patients with cirrhosis who develop HE have an estimated 1-year survival probability of 42% and 3-year survival probability of 23%.

### Neuropsychiatric complications of liver and other solid organ transplantation [^113Gqbbc]. Liver Transplantation (2001). Low credibility.

1. Mental status changes are often the earliest indication of an untoward complication after transplantation. These may be obvious, such as hallucinations or paranoid delusions, or they may be subtle, appearing as changes in personality or motivation. 2. The three most common categories of neuropsychiatric posttransplant complications include the following: (1) concurrent pathological processes, such as mass lesion; (2) effects of vasoconstriction secondary to immunosuppressive medications; and (3) central nervous system pharmacodynamic effects of the immunosuppressive medications. 3. This differential diagnosis should guide the history as well as the mental status and neurological examinations. Suspected acute processes deserve computed tomography scanning. Magnetic resonance imaging, more sensitive to subtle structural change, should be generally reserved for cases suggesting such chronic change or those in which treatment appears ineffective. 4. Treatment follows the differential diagnosis. Concurrent diagnoses dictate specific treatment, such as in drainage of a subdural hematoma or administration of antibiotics for cerebral abscess. Symptoms referable to vasoconstriction suggest switching the primary immunosuppressive agent. Symptoms suggesting delirium indicate lowering the dosage of immunosuppressive medication, as in the case of generalized seizure, or use of very low-dose antipsychotic medication, as in cases of confusion, amotivational states, or personality changes.

### Key insights and clinical pearls in the identification and management of cirrhosis and its complications [^116VZBsx]. The American Journal of Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Cirrhosis is a prevalent, chronic condition with an asymptomatic compensated phase, in which patients may feel well, and a decompensated phase that begins with the onset of complications (eg hepatic encephalopathy, ascites, and/or variceal bleeding). Because patients with cirrhosis may appear healthy with normal liver enzymes, alkaline phosphatase, and serum bilirubin levels, awareness of clinical signals is important. For example, patients with thrombocytopenia should be evaluated for chronic liver disease and cirrhosis. Early recognition and management of cirrhosis-related complications (eg hepatic encephalopathy, ascites, and/or variceal bleeding) are important, given their association with hospitalization and poor prognosis (eg increased odds of short-term mortality). Hepatic encephalopathy can be the most subtle cirrhosis-related complication and associated cognitive impairment may be misdiagnosed. Because hepatic encephalopathy can be associated with hospital readmissions, reducing readmission rates after hepatic encephalopathy-related hospitalizations is critical. This includes incorporating ongoing therapy (eg rifaximin plus lactulose) in postdischarge management plans to reduce the risk of hepatic encephalopathy recurrence. Strategies that mitigate cirrhosis progression and prevent the development of cirrhosis-related complications are key to improving patient outcomes.

- Episodic HE
- Recurrent HE denotes bouts of HE that occur with a time interval of 6 months or less.
- Persistent HE denotes a pattern of behavioral alterations that are always present and interspersed with relapses of overt HE". "According to the existence of precipitating factors, HE is subdivided into
- Nonprecipitated
- Precipitated, and the precipitating factors should be specified". Furthermore, "Precipitating factors can be identified in nearly all bouts of episodic HE type C and should be actively sought and treated when found (Table 3)".

### Sleep disturbances in chronic liver disease [^116iXZTu]. Liver Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

Sleep disturbances are common in chronic liver disease and significantly impact patient outcomes and quality of life. The severity and nature of sleep disturbances vary by liver disease etiology and severity. While there is ongoing research into the association between liver disease and sleep-wake dysfunction, the underlying pathophysiology varies and, in many cases, is poorly understood. Liver disease is associated with alterations in thermoregulation, inflammation, and physical activity, and is associated with disease-specific complications, such as HE, that may directly affect sleep. In this article, we review the relevant pathophysiologic processes, disease-specific sleep-wake disturbances, and clinical management of CLD-associated sleep-wake disturbances.

Considerations in lung disease

Pulmonary complications of catatonia may include pulmonary embolism, aspiration pneumonia, pneumothorax, bronchorrhoea, central hypoventilation, respiratory failure and delayed weaning from mechanical ventilation (ter;).

Catatonia has been described in the context of respiratory illnesses, including influenza and SARS-CoV-2, as well as in critical illnesses (e.g. sepsis, shock). Catatonia in the context of critical illness including respiratory failure may have high comorbidity with delirium. Respiratory failure due to malignant catatonia has been described and may be especially responsive to ECT (ter;), especially in those unable to tolerate a benzodiazepine.

Recommendations for catatonia in kidney, liver and lung disease

In renal impairment, lorazepam dosing does not usually need to be altered, but consider additional monitoring for side effects. (C)
In mild or moderate hepatic impairment, lorazepam dosing does not usually need to be altered, but caution should be exercised when considering lorazepam in severe hepatic impairment. (B)
In severe respiratory disease, consider giving ECT as a first-line treatment rather than benzodiazepines. (D)

### Hepatic encephalopathy [^113r3LNZ]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2022). High credibility.

Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a prognostically relevant neuropsychiatric syndrome that occurs in the course of acute or chronic liver disease. Besides ascites and variceal bleeding, it is the most serious complication of decompensated liver cirrhosis. Ammonia and inflammation are major triggers for the appearance of HE, which in patients with liver cirrhosis involves pathophysiologically low-grade cerebral oedema with oxidative/nitrosative stress, inflammation and disturbances of oscillatory networks in the brain. Severity classification and diagnostic approaches regarding mild forms of HE are still a matter of debate. Current medical treatment predominantly involves lactulose and rifaximin following rigorous treatment of so-called known HE precipitating factors. New treatments based on an improved pathophysiological understanding are emerging.

Chronic brain failure, also known as dementia or major neurocognitive disorder, is a syndrome of progressive functional decline characterized by both cognitive and neuropsychiatric symptoms. It can be conceptualized like other organ failure syndromes and its impact on quality of life can be mitigated with proper treatment. Dementia is a risk factor for delirium, and their symptoms can be similar. Patients with dementia can present with agitation that can lead to injury. Logic and reason are rarely successful when attempting to redirect someone with advanced dementia. Interactions that offer a sense of choice are more likely to succeed.

### Inadequate practices for hepatic encephalopathy management in the inpatient setting [^114GRu2Q]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Classification — Grading and staging of HE

In its 2014 guideline, AASLD recommended classification for HE by four factors: underlying cause (Type A from acute liver failure, Type B from portosystemic bypass or shunting, and Type C from cirrhosis), time course (i.e. "episodic", "recurrent", or "persistent"), presence of precipitating factors (i.e. "nonprecipitated" or "precipitated"), and severity. The severity of HE manifestations is most pertinent to management in the inpatient setting and can be classified by several tools. The West‐Haven Criteria (WHC) (see Table 2) are the most frequently used and overall considered the gold standard; however, one of the limitations of this scale is the subjective nature of patient assessment. These shortcomings have fostered an initiative to find new, more objective, and reproducible methods for grading HE, but these tests are not used in routine clinical practice by hospitalists. Some experts prefer to differentiate between grades of encephalopathy using the spectrum of neurocognitive impairment in cirrhosis classification, labeling them as "CHE" or "MHE" (WHC Grade I) and OHE (WHC Grades II–IV). Alternative severity grading systems for encephalopathy and easy to use in the clinical setting include the Glasgow Coma Score and the Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale.

### Primary versus secondary psychosis in a patient with congenital liver disease [^111Ai449]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

Differential diagnosis

This case illustrates the complexity of making a definitive diagnosis of schizophrenia spectrum illness in a patient with lifelong liver disease who manifests psychotic symptoms, particularly during episodes of decompensated cirrhosis.

The convergence of symptoms and the intricate interplays between schizophrenia and advanced liver disease in this patient necessitate careful consideration of both diagnostic and treatment strategies. While in this patient age of onset and symptoms of thought disorganisation, hallucinations and delusions are consistent with schizophrenia, a diagnosis of schizophrenia is predicated on a lack of other potential causes of mental status change. In this case, strong indicators of delirium or HE rather than decompensation of a primary psychiatric disorder include abrupt and profound alterations in mental status, an underlying medical condition, visual hallucinations, fluctuating consciousness and the sudden onset of psychiatric symptoms during exacerbation of underlying medical illness — all of which were observed in our patient (see table 1).

Table 1
Signs and symptoms supporting the diagnosis of primary psychosis versus encephalopathy

Notably, on interviewing the patient and family, he had not shown any prodromal symptoms of schizophrenia. He exhibited a pattern where exacerbation of psychotic symptoms corresponded with episodes of decompensated cirrhosis. Atypicality of psychotic symptoms, fluctuation in the content of delusions and auditory hallucinations, the presence of visual hallucination, as well as varying associated distress level, may be useful in distinguishing exacerbations of a primary psychotic illness from secondary psychosis. Remarkably, there are periods of stability in mental status, off medication, as long as he maintained stable liver function.

However, during the course of hospitalisation, despite effective treatment for acute HE and improvement of hepatic function, the patient continued to exhibit psychotic symptoms. While the improvement in attention, orientation and memory suggests a partial response to treatment, the persistence of psychosis raises questions regarding its primary origin and the role of liver decompression in exacerbating psychiatric symptoms.

Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) — epidemiology and natural history in cirrhosis: The incidence and prevalence of HE are related to the severity of the underlying liver insufficiency and PSS, and in patients with cirrhosis, fully symptomatic overt HE (OHE) defines the decompensated phase of the disease. The prevalence of OHE at the time of diagnosis of cirrhosis is 10%-14% in general, 16%-21% in those with decompensated cirrhosis, and 10%-50% in patients with transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS), while minimal HE (MHE) or covert HE (CHE) occurs in 20%-80% of patients with cirrhosis. The prevalence of HE in prehepatic noncirrhotic portal hypertension (PH) is not well defined. The risk for the first bout of OHE is 5%-25% within 5 years after cirrhosis diagnosis; a previous bout confers a 40% cumulative risk of recurrence at 1 year, and recurrent OHE carries a 40% cumulative risk of another recurrence within 6 months despite lactulose; even mild cognitive dysfunction or mild electroencephalography (EEG) slowing is associated with approximately one bout of OHE per 3 years of survival. After TIPS, the median cumulative 1-year incidence of OHE is 10%-50%, and patients with HE accounted for approximately 110,000 hospitalizations.

### Agitation and delirium at the end of life: "We couldn' T manage him" [^1153PCsQ]. JAMA (2008). Excellent credibility.

Delirium is the most common neuropsychiatric complication experienced by patients with advanced illness, occurring in up to 85% of patients in the last weeks of life. Using the case of Mr L, a 59-year-old man with metastatic lung cancer who developed an agitated delirium in the last week of life, we review the evaluation and management of delirium near the end of life. Although some studies have identified agitation as a central feature of delirium in 13% to 46% of patients, other studies have found up to 80% of patients near the end of life develop a hypoactive, nonagitated delirium. Both the agitated (hyperactive) and nonagitated (hypoactive) forms of delirium are harbingers of impending death and are associated with increased morbidity in patients who are terminally ill, causing distress for patients, family members, and staff. Delirium is a sign of significant physiological disturbance, usually involving multiple causes, including infection, organ failure, and medication adverse effects. Often these causes of delirium are not reversible in the dying patient, and this influences the outcomes of its management. Delirium can also significantly interfere with the recognition and control of other physical and psychological symptoms, such as pain. Unfortunately, delirium is often misdiagnosed or unrecognized and thus inappropriately treated or untreated in terminally ill patients. To manage delirium in terminally ill patients, clinicians must be able to diagnose it accurately, undertake appropriate assessment of underlying causes, and understand the benefits and risks of the available pharmacological and nonpharmacological interventions.

5.8 Discontinuation Syndrome

Abrupt discontinuation or dosage reduction of PARNATE has been associated with the appearance of new symptoms that include dizziness, nausea, headache, irritability, insomnia, diarrhea, anxiety, fatigue, abnormal dreams, and hyperhidrosis. In general, discontinuation events occurred more frequently with longer duration of therapy.

There have been spontaneous reports of adverse reactions occurring upon discontinuation of MAOIs, particularly when abrupt, including dysphoric mood, irritability, agitation, dizziness, sensory disturbances (e.g. paresthesia, such as electric shock sensations), anxiety, confusion, headache, lethargy, emotional lability, insomnia, hypomania, tinnitus, and seizures. While these reactions are generally self-limiting, there have been reports of prolonged discontinuation symptoms.

Patients should be monitored for these symptoms when discontinuing treatment with PARNATE. A gradual reduction in the dose rather than abrupt cessation is recommended whenever possible [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Adverse Reactions (6)].

5.9 Risk of Clinically Significant Adverse Reactions due to Persistence of MAO Inhibition after Discontinuation

Although excretion of PARNATE is rapid, inhibition of MAO may persist up to 10 days following discontinuation. This should be taken into account when considering the use of potentially interacting substances or the consumption of tyramine-rich food or beverages [see Drug Interactions (7.2)], or when interpreting adverse reactions observed after discontinuation of PARNATE. Care should be taken to differentiate symptoms of persistent MAO inhibition from withdrawal symptoms [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3)].

5.10 Hepatotoxicity

Hepatitis and elevated aminotransferases have been reported in association with PARNATE administration. Patients should be monitored accordingly. PARNATE should be discontinued in patients who develop signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity.

Sedation has occurred in PARNATE-treated patients with cirrhosis. Patients with cirrhosis receiving PARNATE should be monitored for possible increased risks of central nervous system adverse reactions, such as excessive drowsiness.

5.11 Seizures

Seizures have been reported with PARNATE withdrawal after abuse, and with overdose. Patients at risk for seizures should be monitored accordingly.

5.12 Hypoglycemia in Diabetic Patients

Some MAOIs have contributed to hypoglycemic episodes in diabetic patients receiving insulin or other blood-glucose-lowering agents. Monitor blood glucose in patients receiving both PARNATE and blood-glucose-lowering agents. A reduction of the dosage of such agents may be necessary [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]

Hepatic encephalopathy management strategy — Patients with higher grades of HE who are at risk or unable to protect their airway need more intensive monitoring and are ideally managed in an intensive care setting, and alternative causes of encephalopathy are not infrequent in patients with advanced cirrhosis. Controlling precipitating factors in the management of OHE is of paramount importance, because nearly 90% of patients can be treated with just correction of the precipitating factor, and careful attention to this issue is still the cornerstone of HE management.

### Managing systemic symptoms in chronic liver disease [^116mkmDJ]. Journal of Hepatology (2012). Low credibility.

Improved medical management and the changing disease demographic mean that the majority of patients with chronic liver disease are living with the disease rather than dying from it. Historically, the perception has been that the impact of chronic liver disease is related entirely to the consequences of endstage liver disease; however, more recently a number of systemic symptoms have been recognised that can occur at any point in the natural history of chronic liver disease and which can be associated with functional impairment and reduced quality of life. The most characteristic of these systemic symptoms is fatigue, which frequently associates with sleep disturbance and autonomic dysfunction, particularly manifest as abnormality of blood pressure regulation. Cognitive symptoms can occur even in non-cirrhotic patients. Falls can present in patients with autonomic dysfunction, complicated by the presence of peripheral muscle strength problems. Importantly for clinicians managing chronic liver disease, the severity of these systemic symptoms is typically not related to liver disease severity, and therefore despite optimal liver disease management, patients can often continue to experience debilitating symptoms. The similarity in systemic symptoms between different chronic liver diseases (and indeed chronic inflammatory conditions affecting other organs) suggests the possibility of shared pathogenetic processes and raises the possibility of common management strategies, although further research is urgently needed to confirm this. In primary biliary cirrhosis, where our understanding of systemic symptoms is arguably most developed, structured management strategies have been shown to improve the quality of life of patients. It is highly likely that similar approaches will have comparable benefits for other chronic liver disease groups. Here, we review the current understanding of systemic symptoms in chronic liver disease and offer recommendations regarding the successful management of these symptoms. Critical for successful treatment is use of a structured and systematic approach to management in which all contributing factors are addressed in an organised fashion. We believe that such a systematic approach, when applied to research as well as to clinical management, will allow us to reduce the overall burden of chronic liver disease, improve quality of life and enhance functional ability.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^111SEay8]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Alcohol withdrawal delirium — benzodiazepine management and antipsychotic adjuncts: Benzodiazepines are the most commonly used medications to treat patients with delirium because of the favorable therapeutic window, and intermittent IV administration of a long-acting medication or continuous IV infusion of short-acting medication are both effective treatments for alcohol withdrawal delirium. Patients treated with repeated high doses of lorazepam or diazepam require close monitoring due to the rapid onset of action and the risk of accumulation of long-acting benzodiazepine metabolites, which is especially common in patients with impaired hepatic function or among the elderly. If a patient has been delirious longer than 72 hours and has been receiving high doses of benzodiazepines (in the thousands of milligrams), the patient may have developed benzodiazepine-induced delirium, and clinicians should consider reducing the benzodiazepine dose and adding an antipsychotic agent to control agitation and/or confusion. Even if patients are at reduced risk of seizure, antipsychotics should not be used as monotherapy because they lower the seizure threshold; second generation atypical antipsychotics, such as risperidone and quetiapine, are preferred, haloperidol, a first generation antipsychotic, is also an appropriate agent, and antipsychotics may also be used in conjunction with benzodiazepines to control severe agitation and hallucinations associated with early alcohol withdrawal delirium.

### AASLD practice guidance: palliative care and symptom-based management in decompensated cirrhosis [^113hWy2Q]. Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

AASLD Practice Guidance — guidance statements on symptom assessment and management in decompensated cirrhosis (DC) stress systematic, staged, and interdisciplinary care. A wide range of symptoms co-occur in patients with DC, and addressing these symptoms is a key component of high-quality cirrhosis care. For patients with DC, following general palliative care principles, we recommend systematically evaluating the presence and severity of a wide range of symptoms and addressing the symptoms most important to patients. Often, the first approach to symptom management may be nonpharmacological, such as behavioral intervention, physical therapy, or other modalities that address multiple symptoms. Underlying causes of symptoms should be identified and managed first. Symptom management should consider best practices, disease stage, and patient goals and preferences, and evaluation and management of symptoms should be interdisciplinary, when possible, including nursing, social work, and chaplaincy.

Hepatic encephalopathy — lactulose dosing and safety — lactulose dosing should be initiated when the three first elements of the four-pronged approach are completed, using 25 mL of lactulose syrup every 1–2 hours until at least two soft or loose bowel movements per day, and subsequently titrated to maintain two to three bowel movements per day; overuse can cause aspiration, dehydration, hypernatremia, severe perianal skin irritation, and can precipitate HE. Lactulose is the first choice for treatment of episodic OHE (GRADE II-1, B, 1).

### Terbinafine [^113f3YeU]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Hepatotoxicity

Terbinafine tablets are contraindicated for patients with chronic or active liver disease. Before prescribing terbinafine tablets perform liver function tests because hepatotoxicity may occur in patients with and without preexisting liver disease. Cases of liver failure, some leading to liver transplant or death, have occurred with the use of terbinafine tablets in individuals with and without preexisting liver disease.

In the majority of liver cases reported in association with use of terbinafine tablets, the patients had serious underlying systemic conditions. The severity of hepatic events and/or their outcome may be worse in patients with active or chronic liver disease. Periodic monitoring of liver function tests is recommended. Discontinue terbinafine tablets, if biochemical or clinical evidence of liver injury develops.

Warn patients prescribed terbinafine tablets and/or their caregivers to report immediately to their healthcare providers any symptoms or signs of persistent nausea, anorexia, fatigue, vomiting, right upper abdominal pain or jaundice, dark urine, or pale stools. Advise patients with these symptoms to discontinue taking oral terbinafine and immediately evaluate the patient's liver function.

5.2 Taste Disturbance Including Loss of Taste

Taste disturbance, including taste loss, has been reported with the use of terbinafine tablets. It can be severe enough to result in decreased food intake, weight loss, anxiety and depressive symptoms. Taste disturbance may resolve within several weeks after discontinuation of treatment, but may be prolonged (greater than one year), or may be permanent. If symptoms of a taste disturbance occur, terbinafine tablets should be discontinued.

5.3 Smell Disturbance Including Loss of Smell

Smell disturbance, including loss of smell, has been reported with the use of terbinafine tablets. Smell disturbance may resolve after discontinuation of treatment, but may be prolonged (greater than one year), or may be permanent. If symptoms of a smell disturbance occur, terbinafine tablets should be discontinued.

5.4 Depressive Symptoms

Depressive symptoms have occurred during postmarketing use of terbinafine tablets. Prescribers should be alert to the development of depressive symptoms, and patients should be instructed to report depressive symptoms to their physician.

### Acute care and emergency general surgery in patients with chronic liver disease: how can we optimize perioperative care? A review of the literature [^1172SD8u]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Hepatic encephalopathy

Other possible etiologies of global neurologic decline should be investigated (e.g. hypoxia, hypercapnia, hypoglycemia, uremia, medications, delirium tremens, hypoactive delirium, seizures, intracranial hemorrhage). Elevated blood ammonia level (found in over 90% of cases) corroborates the clinical diagnosis, but correlation with the actual disease severity is poor. It should also be noted that monitoring blood ammonia levels is inferior to clinical assessment, and it is not recommended in asymptomatic patients. Benzodiazepines should be avoided and replaced with haloperidol when chemical restraint is indicated.

The classic protein-restricted diet does not find support in the current literature because most patients do not tolerate high-food/calorie intake. Furthermore, malnutrition is a much more significant concern. Despite ongoing debate, branched amino acid supplementation may also be beneficial. Other adjuncts, such as cathartics and oral antibiotics, are recommended in an attempt to decrease the intestinal production of ammonia due to bacterial overgrowth.

Lactulose, a non-absorbable sugar that causes osmotic diarrhea, has been traditionally used to treat hepatic encephalopathy. It acidifies the colon and promotes the conversion of ammonia to ammonium, which is not reabsorbed. Lactulose dosing should be titrated to two to three bowel movements per day. Known side effects of this therapy include electrolyte imbalances, nausea, and bloating.

Rifaximin, a semisynthetic drug derivative of rifampin, was originally employed as a second-line treatment for hepatic encephalopathy. In 2012, a meta-analysis of 12 randomized controlled trials stated that rifaximin had similar effectiveness compared to lactulose, with fewer side effects. A more recent, larger meta-analysis has also further supported its use, although the dominant limitation remains its high cost when compared to lactulose.

Hepatorenal syndrome

Euvolemia and electrolyte homeostasis should be maintained under strict clinical and laboratory monitoring. Acute kidney injury in the absence of hemodynamic instability, use of nephrotoxic drugs, or parenchymal renal disease suggests the diagnosis of hepatorenal syndrome. Additional diagnostic criteria include no improvement in renal function after volume expansion with albumin and diuretic withdrawal. Treatment of hepatorenal syndrome requires the use of splanchnic vasoconstrictors (terlipressin, noradrenalin, or midodrine) and albumin infusion. Improved renal function has been demonstrated with medical treatment, but a mortality benefit is only ultimately achieved with liver transplantation. TIPS placement and renal and hepatic replacement therapies can be indicated as bridging strategies.

### Flumazenil [^115bH5mC]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Use in Cardiovascular Disease

Flumazenil did not increase the work of the heart when used to reverse benzodiazepines in cardiac patients when given at a rate of 0. 1 mg/min in total doses of less than 0.5 mg in studies reported in the clinical literature. Flumazenil alone had no significant effects on cardiovascular parameters when administered to patients with stable ischemic heart disease.

Use in Liver Disease

The clearance of flumazenil is reduced to 40% to 60% of normal in patients with mild to moderate hepatic disease and to 25% of normal in patients with severe hepatic dysfunction (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Pharmacokinetics). While the dose of flumazenil used for initial reversal of benzodiazepine effects is not affected, repeat doses of the drug in liver disease should be reduced in size or frequency.

Use in Drug- and Alcohol-Dependent Patients

Flumazenil should be used with caution in patients with alcoholism and other drug dependencies due to the increased frequency of benzodiazepine tolerance and dependence observed in these patient populations.

Flumazenil is not recommended either as a treatment for benzodiazepine dependence or for the management of protracted benzodiazepine abstinence syndromes, as such use has not been studied.

The administration of flumazenil can precipitate benzodiazepine withdrawal in animals and man. This has been seen in healthy volunteers treated with therapeutic doses of oral lorazepam for up to 2 weeks who exhibited effects such as hot flushes, agitation and tremor when treated with cumulative doses of up to 3 mg doses of flumazenil.

Similar adverse experiences suggestive of flumazenil precipitation of benzodiazepine withdrawal have occurred in some adult patients in clinical trials. Such patients had a short-lived syndrome characterized by dizziness, mild confusion, emotional lability, agitation (with signs and symptoms of anxiety), and mild sensory distortions. This response was dose-related, most common at doses above 1 mg, rarely required treatment other than reassurance and was usually short lived. When required, these patients (5to 10 cases) were successfully treated with usual doses of a barbiturate, a benzodiazepine, or other sedative drug.

Practitioners should assume that flumazenil administration may trigger dose-dependent withdrawal syndromes in patients with established physical dependence on benzodiazepines and may complicate the management of withdrawal syndromes for alcohol, barbiturates and cross-tolerant sedatives.

### Acquisition of epithelial plasticity in human chronic liver disease [^114XUJZi]. Nature (2024). Excellent credibility.

Main

The ability of adult organs to regenerate has been well documented in animal models, and functional studies combined with lineage-tracing experiments have shown that different injuries induce divergent regenerative processes –. However, it is difficult to demonstrate the existence of such events in human organs for technical and ethical reasons. The liver is a particularly interesting organ in this context. The main functional cell types in the hepatic epithelium are the hepatocytes, which are known for their metabolic roles, and the cholangiocytes, which line the biliary tree and transport bile acids. The process by which these cells are replaced after injury depends on the insult encountered. Cell proliferation occurs during acute liver injury –, but this capacity to proliferate is abolished in chronic diseases. Animal studies have revealed three alternative mechanisms,: stem cells or progenitors can be activated and then differentiate into epithelial cells –; cholangiocytes may transdifferentiate into hepatocytes, or vice versa,–; or hepatocytes and cholangiocytes could reverse to a developmental progenitor to restore the corresponding cell compartment –. Signs of these mechanisms have been observed in humans, but the nature of the regenerative processes that occur during chronic liver disease remain to be fully understood –. To address this question, we combined single-nucleus analyses, 3D imaging and functional experiments to study both cell behaviour and the regenerative processes that occur during the progression of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), a chronic liver disease that affects a growing population of people worldwide.

### Rifaximin treatment for reduction of risk of overt hepatic encephalopathy recurrence [^115mv36t]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a common problem in patients with chronic liver disease and is characterized by diminished mentation and neuromuscular abnormalities. Symptoms range from subtle cognitive changes to coma and death. Gut-derived toxins such as ammonia are thought to play a central role in the pathogenesis of HE. Treatment strategies are directed at increased elimination or reduction of gut-derived ammonia in addition to correction of dynamic conditions that provoke bouts of HE. The standard of care for treatment of acute HE is lactulose, a nonabsorbable disaccharide that is thought to increase elimination and reduce absorption of ammonia. Although lactulose seems to work in the acute setting, the rate of recurrent HE on maintenance lactulose is high. Medications have been sought that reduce the rate of recurrent HE in patients at high risk for HE but none have been identified. Rifaximin is a poorly absorbed antibiotic that is thought to reduce ammonia production by eliminating ammonia-producing colonic bacteria. Many small studies have suggested that rifaximin is effective in treating acute HE and is extremely well tolerated. This led to a randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter, multinational trial investigating the efficacy of rifaximin over a 6-month period in reducing the risk of recurrent HE in patients at baseline, but with a history of at least two bouts of acute HE in the previous 6 months prior to enrollment. Lactulose could be administered at the discretion of the investigator. A total of 299 patients were randomized to receive rifaximin or placebo; 91% of patients in each group received lactulose. Compared with placebo, patients at high risk for recurrent HE in the rifaximin group had highly statistically significant reductions in bouts of acute HE (58%) and reductions in hospitalizations related to HE (50%) over a 6-month period. The medication was well tolerated with a side-effect profile comparable to placebo. This led to the approval of rifaximin for reduction of risk of recurrent HE by the US Food and Drug Administration in March 2010. It is recommended that patients with a history of recurrent acute HE should be maintained on rifaximin with or without lactulose to reduce the risk of recurrent HE and related hospitalization.

### How to diagnose and manage hepatic encephalopathy: a consensus statement on roles and responsibilities beyond the liver specialist [^1159KkHQ]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Hepatic encephalopathy is defined as brain dysfunction caused by liver insufficiency and/or portosystemic shunting. Symptoms include nonspecific cognitive impairment, personality changes and changes in consciousness. Overt (symptomatic) hepatic encephalopathy is a common complication of cirrhosis that is associated with a poor prognosis. Patients with hepatic encephalopathy may present to healthcare providers who do not have primary responsibility for management of patients with cirrhosis. Therefore, we developed a series of 'consensus points' to provide some guidance on management.

Methods

Using a modified 'Delphi' process, consensus statements were developed that summarize our recommendations for the diagnosis and management of patients with hepatic encephalopathy. Points on which full consensus could not be reached are also discussed.

Results

Our recommendations emphasize the role of all healthcare providers in the identification of cognitive impairment in patients with cirrhosis and provide guidance on steps that might be considered to make a diagnosis of overt hepatic encephalopathy. In addition, treatment recommendations are summarized. Minimal hepatic encephalopathy can have a significant impact on patients; however, in most circumstances identification and management of minimal hepatic encephalopathy remains the responsibility of specialists in liver diseases.

Conclusion

Our opinion statements aim to define the roles and responsibilities of all healthcare providers who at times care for patients with cirrhosis and hepatic encephalopathy. We suggest that these recommendations be considered further by colleagues in other disciplines and hope that future guidelines consider the management of patients with cirrhosis and with a 'suspicion' of cognitive impairment through to a formal diagnosis of hepatic encephalopathy.

### Hepatic encephalopathy: from pathophysiology to therapeutic management [^113kTTNW]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2011). Low credibility.

Hepatic encephalopathy is a complex and potentially reversible neuropsychiatric syndrome complicating acute or chronic liver disease. Clinical manifestations are multiple and varied, ranging from minimal neurological changes to coma. Ammonia is the main toxic substance involved in the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy, although other mechanisms, such as modifications of the blood-brain barrier, disruptions in neurotransmission and abnormalities in GABAergic and benzodiazepine pathways may also play a role. The identification and treatment of precipitating factors is crucial in the management of patients with hepatic encephalopathy. Current treatments are based on reducing intestinal ammonia load by agents such as antibiotics or disaccharides, although their efficacy is yet to be clearly established.

### Primary versus secondary psychosis in a patient with congenital liver disease [^115XQ9MY]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

Case presentation

The patient is a male in his mid-20s with a history of early-onset cirrhosis secondary to congenital biliary atresia, and Kasai procedure at the age of 2 weeks. From childhood, the patient has been treated with lactulose, rifaximin and propranolol for chronic liver cirrhosis. Four years prior to recent presentation, he experienced his first psychotic episode which was concurrent with decompensated cirrhosis and high ammonia level in the context of liver medication non-adherence. Notably, the patient's cognitive development and educational milestones were reportedly within normal limits up to his 20s. Also, there was no personal or family history of psychiatric symptoms and no history of alcohol or drug use. After an extended period of medical and psychiatric hospitalisation, a diagnosis of schizophrenia was established, leading to the initiation of antipsychotic treatment with paliperidone. Concurrently, his HE medications were restarted and his mental status and ammonia levels improved.

Following several months of antipsychotic treatment, the patient was gradually tapered off of medication. Remarkably, after discontinuation, the patient displayed no discernible signs of psychotic illness, until he again experienced decompensation of cirrhosis. In fact, this occurred several times, where psychotic exacerbations and psychiatric hospitalisations were preceded by decompensated cirrhosis.

On his initial evaluation in our emergency department, the patient presented with disorientation, confusion, psychomotor slowing and jaundice following several days of medication non-adherence. Additionally, the ammonia level was measured at 48 µmol/L (Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score: 17). He was admitted for acute medical care with consultation from the hepatology, neurology and psychiatry specialists. On initial psychiatric evaluation, the patient exhibited pronounced disorganisation both in the thought process as well as psychomotor agitation, posturing and moving his arms in bizarre ways and appearing internally preoccupied. During the course of hospitalisation, the patient displayed fluctuating mental status, elevated ammonia levels, cognitive impairment, as well as auditory and visual hallucinations (figure 1). The initial head CT scan and MRI showed no abnormalities while the ammonia level remained consistently elevated and fluctuating.

### Circulating fatty acids and risk of hepatocellular carcinoma and chronic liver disease mortality in the UK biobank [^113wWMKk]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Primary liver cancer ranks as the seventh most commonly occurring cancer in the world and the second most common cause of cancer mortality. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the dominant type of primary liver cancer and has become an important cause of cancer-related deaths in the UK. Most HCCs occur in the context of chronic liver disease (CLD), such as viral hepatitis, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), and alcoholic fatty liver disease. In addition, CLD leads to 2 million deaths worldwide each year and is therefore a notable public health concern. Both HCC and CLD deaths represent advanced liver disease. The growing burden related to HCC and CLD emphasizes the importance of identifying people at high risk and taking measures as soon as possible.

Fatty acids are the main components of circulating lipids, which can be present in a free state (also known as non-esterified fatty acids) or combine with glycerol or cholesterol to form esters. According to the number and position of carbon–carbon double bonds, fatty acids can be broadly categorized into saturated fatty acids (SFA), mono-unsaturated fatty acids (MUFA), and poly-unsaturated fatty acids (PUFA, which can be further categorized into n-3 and n-6 by the position of the first double bond in relation to the omega carbon).

Encephalopathy (delirium)

Encephalopathy is another common complication in patients with cirrhosis. A careful assessment of the cause of encephalopathy should be undertaken looking for causes such as infection, electrolyte disturbance, occult bleeding, constipation or sedative drugs. For patients with grade 4 encephalopathy (coma) consider orotracheal intubation to reduce the risk of developing aspiration pneumonia. In conscious patients, oral lactulose (20 mL–30 mL four times per day) should be administered aiming for 2 soft stools per day. For patients with a reduced conscious level, phosphate enemas or lactulose administered by nasogastric tube should be considered. Consider a CT head examination in patients where the confusion is unexplained to exclude intracranial pathology, such as subdural haematoma.

Other considerations

In the recent UK audit of blood component use in cirrhosis, thrombotic events occurred in 3% of patients. Thromboprophylaxis with low-dose, low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), is therefore recommended to reduce the risk of thrombosis, unless the patient is bleeding or has a platelet count less than 50×10 9 /L. Recent evidence suggests that even with apparent abnormalities on blood testing suggestive of a hypocoagulable state (prolonged prothrombin time), patients with cirrhosis typically have normal clot-forming capacity provided the platelet count is > 50×10 9 /L, and some patients with advanced cirrhosis are actually hypercoagulable. Changes in the balance of the hepatic production of procoagulant and anticoagulant blood clotting factors in cirrhosis are believed to be responsible for this phenomenon. Although thromboprophylaxis with LMWH has not been specifically trialled in hospitalised patients with decompensated cirrhosis to prevent thromboembolism, a previous study demonstrated that the administration of enoxaparin 4000 µ/day for 48 weeks reduced the risk of portal vein thrombosis, liver decompensation and mortality, and no haemorrhagic side effects were seen.

### Traumatic portacaval shunt: a rare complication to be considered in patients with encephalopathy [^111NXUQJ]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2025). Medium credibility.

What we did and why

After the trend of conservative management of hemodynamically stable liver injuries, no procedure is performed on the liver or the portacaval fistula. The patient is transferred to the ICU for postoperative follow-up. By day 3, the patient developed confusion. A brain CT is performed for delirium and agitation but revealed no lesions or cerebral edema. Blood tests showed a normal ammonia level, suggesting the delirium is unrelated to hepatic encephalopathy. Nevertheless, management similar to hepatic encephalopathy protocols is adopted including biochemical parameters correction, sedation withdrawal, discontinuation of proton pump inhibitors and bowel regulation with lactulose. Apart from the delirium, the patient presents no other organ failure, acute renal failure, or bleeding. Acute liver failure (characterized by rapidly progressive liver dysfunction associated with a fall in PT ratio levels less than 50%) is not observed. The patient is monitored by iterative cerebral and abdominal CT scans (liver lesions). Over several weeks, a gradual and favorable recovery occurs. The portacaval shunt is monitored with repeated abdominal CT and completely resolves over 10 months (figure 1B). Unfortunately, on day 15 a CT scan reveals an aneurysm of the left hepatic artery, which is successfully embolized without complication. No connection between the artery and the portacaval shunt is identified.

### Hepatic encephalopathy: novel insights into classification, pathophysiology and therapy [^112fPqF9]. Journal of Hepatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a frequent and serious complication of both chronic liver disease and acute liver failure. HE manifests as a wide spectrum of neuropsychiatric abnormalities, from subclinical changes (mild cognitive impairment) to marked disorientation, confusion and coma. The clinical and economic burden of HE is considerable, and it contributes greatly to impaired quality of life, morbidity and mortality. This review will critically discuss the latest classification of HE, as well as the pathogenesis and pathophysiological pathways underlying the neurological decline in patients with end-stage liver disease. In addition, management strategies, diagnostic approaches, currently available therapeutic options and novel treatment strategies are discussed.

### Specific challenges in geriatric cirrhosis and hepatic encephalopathy [^116mKWo6]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2022). Medium credibility.

As the world's population ages, diseases predominantly found in the elderly now overlap with diseases that were thought to be the purview of younger patients. This includes chronic liver disease, which affects more than 2 billion people worldwide. Owing to the obesity epidemic (and associated metabolic diseases), nonalcoholic fatty liver disease has become the most common cause of chronic liver disease and cirrhosis. A major complication of cirrhosis is hepatic encephalopathy (HE), which becomes challenging to diagnose in elderly patients. HE is usually included in the differential diagnosis of acute delirium but not of reversible dementias. To illustrate this point, we present 2 cases of older patients that were misdiagnosed as having dementia and Parkinson's disease or a parkinsonian syndrome but had contributions from cirrhosis. Both cognitive impairment and tremor resolved with treatment of HE.

### AASLD practice guidance: palliative care and symptom-based management in decompensated cirrhosis [^115nzFJt]. Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

Guidance statements — sleep disturbances in decompensated cirrhosis state: Clinicians should first evaluate and treat underlying causes for insomnia such as HE, pruritus, obstructive sleep apnea, and restless legs syndrome. Clinicians should perform a thorough assessment of the timing of physical activity, meals, and medications to promote good sleep hygiene. Mindfulness-based stress reduction therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy approaches can be considered in patients with cirrhosis and disordered sleep. Short-term use of melatonin 3 mg or hydroxyzine 25 mg nightly can improve sleep quality in patients with Child-Pugh A and B cirrhosis, but data on long-term use of these medications are limited. Although chronic use of benzodiazepines should be generally avoided in patients with DC, specific clinical circumstances may warrant their use, such as anxiety at the end of life when comfort is the stated priority.

### The landscape of gene mutations in cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma [^1135nkfN]. Journal of Hepatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Chronic liver disease and primary liver cancer are a massive global problem, with a future increase in incidences predicted. The most prevalent form of primary liver cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, occurs after years of chronic liver disease. Mutations in the genome are a causative and defining feature of all cancers. Chronic liver disease, mostly at the cirrhotic stage, causes the accumulation of progressive mutations which can drive cancer development. Within the liver, a Darwinian process selects out dominant clones with selected driver mutations but also leaves a trail of passenger mutations which can be used to track the evolution of a tumour. Understanding what causes specific mutations and how they combine with one another to form cancer is a question at the heart of understanding, preventing and tackling liver cancer. Herein, we review the landscape of gene mutations in cirrhosis, especially those paving the way toward hepatocellular carcinoma development, that have been characterised by recent studies capitalising on technological advances in genomic sequencing. With these insights, we are beginning to understand how cancers form in the liver, particularly on the background of chronic liver disease. This knowledge may soon lead to breakthroughs in the way we detect, diagnose and treat this devastating disease.

### CAQ corner: acute liver failure management and liver transplantation [^111tjQVp]. Liver Transplantation (2022). Medium credibility.

KEY POINTS

Acute liver failure (ALF) is a rare disease with an estimated annual incidence of 2000–3000 cases in the United States that is due to a multitude of etiologies, with acetaminophen (APAP) overdose being the most common cause followed by drug‐induced liver injury, autoimmune hepatitis, hepatitis B virus, and indeterminate ALF.
Rapid diagnosis of ALF etiology is required to facilitate early disease‐specific therapies such as N ‐acetylcysteine for APAP overdose and to assist with prognostication.
Assessment of serial laboratory parameters (e.g. Factor V, lactate, ammonia) along with tracking of vital organ status is recommended to assist with bedside clinical decision making.
Cerebral edema in patients with ALF arises due to increased production and reduced clearance of putative neurotoxins that can manifest with agitation, reduced sensorium, and upper motor neuron signs.
Management of elevated intracranial pressure in patients with ALF involves hyperventilation, osmotic agents, reducing cerebral metabolism, and use of vasopressors to maintain an adequate cerebral perfusion pressure.
Despite the universal presence of a multifactorial coagulopathy, clinically significant bleeding is seen in only 5%–10% of patients with ALF. Therefore, prophylactic blood products are not recommended unless a moderate‐ or high‐risk invasive procedure is planned.
Patients with ALF receive the highest medical priority for liver transplantation (LT) as a status 1A candidate, and they currently account for 3% of annual LTs in the United States.
Nearly 60% of waitlisted patients with ALF will not undergo LT due to either clinical improvement or development of contraindications to LT.
Emergency LT in patients with ALF is associated with an 80%–90% 1‐year survival with most early deaths attributed to infectious and neurological complications.
Long‐term outcomes in ALF LT recipients are generally favorable and possibly superior to patients with cirrhosis, but higher levels of long‐term immunosuppression are frequently required.

Testing for minimal hepatic encephalopathy (MHE) and covert hepatic encephalopathy (CHE) — MHE and CHE is defined as the presence of test-dependent or clinical signs of brain dysfunction in patients with chronic liver disease who are not disoriented or display asterixis. The term "minimal" conveys that there is no clinical sign, cognitive or other, of HE, and the term "covert" includes minimal and grade 1 HE. Testing strategies can be divided into two major types: psychometric and neurophysiological.

### How to diagnose and manage hepatic encephalopathy: a consensus statement on roles and responsibilities beyond the liver specialist [^112jueZv]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is defined as 'brain dysfunction caused by liver insufficiency and/or portosystemic shunting'. Symptoms of overt HE include nonspecific cognitive impairment, personality changes and changes in consciousness – particularly disturbance of the sleep/wake cycle–. In more severe HE, patients may become disorientated, acutely confused and suffer from agitation or coma. Minimal HE, the mildest form of HE, is clinically undetectable and requires the use of psychometric or neurophysiological testing to make a diagnosis.

Overt HE is a common complication of cirrhosis; at diagnosis approximately 10% of patients have HE, and 20–40% of patients with cirrhosis will develop HE during their disease course. In a multicentre study in Europe, of 2145 successive patients at different stages of liver disease 21% had HE. HE is also associated with a poor prognosis; 1-year mortality in patients with HE was 64% in one population-based series. Mortality may also be correlated with HE severity. In addition, HE affects the patient's quality of life, and caregiver burden. There is also accumulating evidence that after apparent resolution of HE persistent cognitive dysfunction may occur.

AASLD — nausea and vomiting management in cirrhosis outlines nonpharmacological and pharmacological options. Nonpharmacological approaches can include behavioral avoidance, removal of triggering medications, treatment of underlying physiological causes, use of ginger, guided imagery or relaxation techniques, and acupuncture. First-line pharmacotherapy for nausea and vomiting in patients with cirrhosis may include a trial of a histamine H2 antagonist or proton pump inhibitor in patients with suspected reflux-associated nausea. Ondansetron can be used in patients with liver impairment at a dose of up to 8 mg/d, with monitoring for constipation and QT prolongation. In a small RCT in cirrhosis with mild encephalopathy, metoclopramide (up to 60 mg daily) versus placebo was studied over a period of 2 weeks; although metoclopramide reduced nausea and heartburn, extrapyramidal side effects limit long-term use and a 50% dose reduction is recommended for patients with hepatic impairment. Other options include olanzapine, haloperidol, or prochlorperazine, but prochlorperazine should be avoided in jaundice given case reports of cholestatic liver injury.

### Acetyl-L-carnitine for patients with hepatic encephalopathy [^114SBR4W]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Hepatic encephalopathy is a common and devastating neuropsychiatric complication of acute liver failure or chronic liver disease. Ammonia content in the blood seems to play a role in the development of hepatic encephalopathy. Treatment for hepatic encephalopathy is complex. Acetyl-L-carnitine is a substance that may reduce ammonia toxicity. This review assessed the benefits and harms of acetyl-L-carnitine for patients with hepatic encephalopathy.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of acetyl-L-carnitine for patients with hepatic encephalopathy.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE Ovid, Embase Ovid, LILACS, and Science Citation Index Expanded for randomised clinical trials. We sought additional randomised clinical trials from the World Health Organization Clinical Trials Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov. We performed all electronic searches until 10 September 2018. We looked through the reference lists of retrieved publications and review articles, and we searched the FDA and EMA websites.

Selection Criteria

We searched for randomised clinical trials in any setting, recruiting people with hepatic encephalopathy. Trials were eligible for inclusion if they compared acetyl-L-carnitine plus standard care (e.g. antibiotics, lactulose) versus placebo or no acetyl-L-carnitine plus standard care. We are well aware that by selecting randomised clinical trials, we placed greater focus on potential benefits than on potential harms.

Data Collection and Analysis

We selected randomised clinical trials, assessed risk of bias in eight domains, and extracted data in a duplicate and independent fashion. We estimated risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MDs) for continuous outcomes. We measured statistical heterogeneity using I² and D² statistics. We subjected our analyses to fixed-effect and random-effects model meta-analyses. We assessed bias risk domains to control systematic errors. We assessed overall quality of the data for each individual outcome by using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We identified five randomised clinical trials involving 398 participants. All trials included only participants with cirrhosis as the underlying cause of hepatic encephalopathy. Trials included participants with covert or overt hepatic encephalopathy. All trials were conducted in Italy by a single team and assessed acetyl-L-carnitine compared with placebo. Oral intervention was the most frequent route of administration. All trials were at high risk of bias and were underpowered. None of the trials were sponsored by the pharmaceutical industry. None of the identified trials reported information on all-cause mortality, serious adverse events, or days of hospitalisation. Only one trial assessed quality of life using the Short Form (SF)-36 scale (67 participants; very low-quality evidence). The effects of acetyl-L-carnitine compared with placebo on general health at 90 days are uncertain (MD -6.20 points, 95% confidence interval (CI) -9.51 to -2.89). Results for additional domains of the SF-36 are also uncertain. One trial assessed fatigue using the Wessely and Powell test (121 participants; very low-quality evidence). The effects are uncertain in people with moderate-grade hepatic encephalopathy (mental fatigue: MD 0.40 points, 95% CI -0.21 to 1.01; physical fatigue: MD -0.20 points, 95% CI -0.92 to 0.52) and mild-grade hepatic encephalopathy (mental fatigue: -0.80 points, 95% CI -1.48 to -0.12; physical fatigue: 0.20 points, 95% CI -0.72 to 1.12). Meta-analysis showed a reduction in blood ammonium levels favouring acetyl-L-carnitine versus placebo (MD -13.06 mg/dL, 95% CI -17.24 to -8.99; 387 participants; 5 trials; very low-quality evidence). It is unclear whether acetyl-L-carnitine versus placebo increases the risk of non-serious adverse events (8/126 (6.34%) vs 3/120 (2.50%); RR 2.51, 95% CI 0.68 to 9.22; 2 trials; very low-quality evidence). Overall, adverse events data were poorly reported and harms may have been underestimated.

Authors' Conclusions

This Cochrane systematic review analysed a heterogeneous group of five trials at high risk of bias and with high risk of random errors conducted by only one research team. We assessed acetyl-L-carnitine versus placebo in participants with cirrhosis with covert or overt hepatic encephalopathy. Hence, we have no data on the drug for hepatic encephalopathy in acute liver failure. We found no information about all-cause mortality, serious adverse events, or days of hospitalisation. We found no clear differences in effect between acetyl-L-carnitine and placebo regarding quality of life, fatigue, and non-serious adverse events. Acetyl-L-carnitine reduces blood ammonium levels compared with placebo. We rated all evidence as of very low quality due to pitfalls in design and execution, inconsistency, small sample sizes, and very few events. The harms profile for acetyl-L-carnitine is presently unclear. Accordingly, we need further randomised clinical trials to assess acetyl-L-carnitine versus placebo conducted according to the SPIRIT statements and reported according to the CONSORT statements.

### AASLD practice guidance: palliative care and symptom-based management in decompensated cirrhosis [^113DvgKN]. Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

Sleep disturbance management in cirrhosis — pharmacologic options and cautions are as follows: In randomized trials of patients with Child-Pugh A and B cirrhosis, melatonin 3 mg nightly for 2 weeks and zolpidem 5 mg nightly for 4 weeks were effective for improving sleep quality, but these medications have not been trialed in more-advanced disease or longer duration. Hydroxyzine 25 mg at bedtime improved subjective and objective sleep measures versus placebo in a trial of 35 patients with cirrhosis and minimal encephalopathy. Zolpidem should generally be avoided in patients with DC because of impaired hepatic clearance, minimal data, and potentiation of encephalopathy. Benzodiazepines should generally not be used for sleep in this population given risks, though there are potential, limited indications at the end of life.

Patients presenting to hospital with liver disease should be screened for AUD and an estimation of typical number of units of alcohol per week recorded

Evaluation of alcohol intake is important for accurate diagnosis of liver disease and assessing the need for management of alcohol withdrawal. Screening for AUD should be done with validated tools such as AUDIT or its abbreviated forms such as AUDIT-C or FAST. Integrated care of liver disease and AUD requires the engagement of multiple practitioners to be effective and relies on prompt identification of patients who need care. All those experiencing alcohol dependence should be monitored for the early signs of alcohol withdrawal (for example sweats, tremor, craving or agitation). Those typically drinking daily > 15 units of alcohol are likely to experience moderate dependence. Those typically drinking daily > 30 units of alcohol are likely to experience severe alcohol dependence and at greater risk of severe alcohol withdrawal symptoms. In addition to the direct management of ALD, there is value in systematic screening for alcohol misuse in all patients admitted to hospital to better manage alcohol withdrawal and to identify those at risk of liver disease.

Patients admitted to hospital with ALD should be reviewed by a clinician trained in hepatology and the management of alcohol withdrawal within 24 hours of admission

Early consultant review improves outcomes in hospital admissions. In patients with acutely decompensated ALD who may also require management of alcohol withdrawal, this complexity requires early specialist review. Timely review by senior specialist clinicians has been shown to reduce early mortality in patients admitted with decompensated liver disease. All patients with decompensated ALD cirrhosis should have their initial management guided by the BSG/BASL Decompensated Cirrhosis Care Bundle.

### Liver progenitor cell-driven liver regeneration [^1113WXYH]. Experimental & Molecular Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Although LPC-driven liver regeneration occurs to restore liver parenchyma in chronic liver diseases, it does not appear to occur effectively in patients with advanced liver disease. A correlation between LPC numbers and disease severity in patients with chronic liver diseasesimplies not only that LPCs are activated in the patients but also that the LPCs ineffectively differentiate into hepatocytes. Persistent LPCs induce inflammation and subsequent fibrosis by secreting proinflammatory cytokines. Since promoting the differentiation of LPCs into hepatocytes can generate more functional hepatocytes and concomitantly reduce fibrosis, a strategy to promote the differentiation is an attractive therapeutic option for patients with advanced liver disease. To establish such a strategy, it is crucial to identify appropriate target molecules of which manipulation promotes the differentiation of LPCs into hepatocytes. Research using the animal models of chronic and severe liver injury will help to discover such molecules and eventually make the strategy feasible.

### Terbinafine hydrochloride [^115ip5pF]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Hepatotoxicity

Terbinafine tablets are contraindicated for patients with chronic or active liver disease. Before prescribing terbinafine tablets, perform liver function tests because hepatotoxicity may occur in patients with and without preexisting liver disease. Cases of liver failure, some leading to liver transplant or death, have occurred with the use of terbinafine tablets in individuals with and without preexisting liver disease.

In the majority of liver cases reported in association with use of terbinafine tablets, the patients had serious underlying systemic conditions. The severity of hepatic events and/or their outcome may be worse in patients with active or chronic liver disease. Periodic monitoring of liver function tests is recommended. Discontinue terbinafine tablets if biochemical or clinical evidence of liver injury develops.

Warn patients prescribed terbinafine tablets and/or their caregivers to report immediately to their healthcare providers any symptoms or signs of persistent nausea, anorexia, fatigue, vomiting, right upper abdominal pain or jaundice, dark urine, or pale stools. Advise patients with these symptoms to discontinue taking oral terbinafine, and immediately evaluate the patient's liver function.

5.2 Taste Disturbance Including Loss of Taste

Taste disturbance, including taste loss, has been reported with the use of terbinafine tablets. It can be severe enough to result in decreased food intake, weight loss, anxiety, and depressive symptoms. Taste disturbance may resolve within several weeks after discontinuation of treatment, but may be prolonged (greater than 1 year), or may be permanent. If symptoms of a taste disturbance occur, terbinafine tablets should be discontinued.

5.3 Smell Disturbance Including Loss of Smell

Smell disturbance, including loss of smell, has been reported with the use of terbinafine tablets. Smell disturbance may resolve after discontinuation of treatment, but may be prolonged (greater than 1 year), or may be permanent. If symptoms of a smell disturbance occur, terbinafine tablets should be discontinued.

5.4 Depressive Symptoms

Depressive symptoms have occurred during postmarketing use of terbinafine tablets. Prescribers should be alert to the development of depressive symptoms, and patients should be instructed to report depressive symptoms to their physician.

### Amantadine hydrochloride (amantadine HCl) [^113ufKSr]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

The management of NMS should include: 1) intensive symptomatic treatment and medical monitoring, and 2) treatment of any concomitant serious medical problems for which specific treatments are available. Dopamine agonists, such as bromocriptine, and muscle relaxants, such as dantrolene are often used in the treatment of NMS, however, their effectiveness has not been demonstrated in controlled studies.

Renal disease: Because amantadine hydrochloride is mainly excreted in the urine, it accumulates in the plasma and in the body when renal function declines. Thus, the dose of amantadine hydrochloride should be reduced in patients with renal impairment and in individuals who are 65 years of age or older (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION; Dosage for Impaired Renal Function).

Liver disease:

Care should be exercised when administering amantadine hydrochloride to patients with liver disease. Rare instances of reversible elevation of liver enzymes have been reported in patients receiving amantadine hydrochloride, though a specific relationship between the drug and such changes has not been established.

Therapy for episodes of OHE — In addition to the other elements of the four-pronged approach to treatment of HE, specific drug treatment is part of the management; most drugs have not been tested by rigorous randomized, controlled studies and are utilized based on circumstantial observations, and in the hospital, a nasogastric tube can be used to administer oral therapies in patients who are unable to swallow or have an aspiration risk. Nonabsorbable disaccharides — Lactulose is generally used as initial treatment for OHE, lack of effect of lactulose should prompt a clinical search for unrecognized precipitating factors and competing causes for the brain impairment, in addition, most recent trials on lactulose have been open label in nature, cost considerations alone add to the argument in support of lactulose, and in some centers, lactitol is preferred to lactulose, based on small meta-analyses of even smaller trials.
