## Question

A 54-year-old man with a history of hypertension presents to the emergency department with a 2-day history of redness, swelling, and warmth over his left lower leg. He reports mild pain but denies fever, chills, or malaise. On examination, his temperature is 37.1°C, heart rate is 82 bpm, and blood pressure is 138/84 mmHg. The left lower leg shows a 10x8 cm area of erythema with indistinct margins, mild edema, and tenderness. There is no fluctuance or purulent drainage. No lymphangitis is noted. He appears well and has no signs of systemic toxicity.

Based on current guideline recommendations, what is the most appropriate initial empiric antibiotic therapy for this patient?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the most appropriate initial empiric antibiotic therapy for a 54-year-old man with nonpurulent cellulitis of the left lower extremity, no systemic toxicity, and a history of hypertension. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about classifying the infection phenotype and severity. Then, I should verify the likely pathogens and whether MRSA coverage is indicated. Next, I will review guideline-concordant empiric options and choose the best oral agent. After that, I need to confirm dosing, duration, and follow-up. Finally, I should consider special scenarios, stewardship, and what to do if the patient does not improve as expected.

> Let me first confirm the clinical classification. This is nonpurulent cellulitis without abscess, ulcer, or purulent drainage, and there are no systemic inflammatory response features or hemodynamic instability, which places him in the mild, uncomplicated category suitable for outpatient therapy rather than hospitalization or broad-spectrum IV regimens [^114pSATx] [^111ek3cL].

> I need to check the likely pathogens. In nonpurulent cellulitis, β-hemolytic streptococci predominate, with methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus as a less common contributor; MRSA is an unusual cause in this phenotype unless specific risk factors are present, so routine MRSA coverage is not recommended initially [^114pSATx] [^111pS5Gp] [^114eeoYo].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about MRSA. I should verify risk factors that would push me to cover MRSA up front: penetrating trauma, prior MRSA infection or colonization, injection drug use, purulence or abscess, or systemic toxicity. None of those are present here, so empiric MRSA therapy is not indicated at this time [^114pSATx] [^112z7Dvu].

> Next, I should review guideline-concordant empiric options. For typical nonpurulent cellulitis, IDSA recommends an antibiotic active against streptococci, with oral therapy appropriate for stable outpatients. Suitable choices include penicillin, amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, dicloxacillin, cephalexin, or clindamycin, with β-lactams favored when there is no β-lactam allergy [^111pS5Gp] [^114pSATx].

> Let me think about the best first-line pick. Cephalexin is a reasonable default because it reliably covers streptococci and MSSA, aligns with local practice patterns, and avoids unnecessary MRSA coverage. If β-lactam allergy is present, clindamycin monotherapy is an alternative that covers streptococci and MSSA/MRSA, though I should confirm local clindamycin inducible resistance patterns before choosing it [^116QtZHg] [^111pS5Gp].

> I should confirm dosing and duration. A typical regimen is cephalexin 500 mg orally every 6 hours for 5 days, extending to 7–10 days if there is inadequate improvement at 5 days. This shorter-course strategy is supported by data showing 5-day therapy is as effective as 10 days when patients improve clinically by day 5 [^116QtZHg] [^114pSATx].

> Wait, let me verify supportive measures that reduce recurrence. Elevation of the affected limb, meticulous skin care, and examination and treatment of toe-web fissuring or tinea pedis are recommended to address portals of entry and reduce recurrence risk, which I should reinforce during discharge planning [^114NgcMq] [^114pSATx].

> I will now examine follow-up and contingency plans. Arrange reassessment within 48–72 hours to ensure clinical improvement. If there is no improvement or deterioration, I should reconsider the diagnosis, look for abscess or necrotizing infection, and then add MRSA coverage or broaden therapy based on evolving risk factors and local epidemiology [^114pSATx] [^112z7Dvu].

> But wait, what if this is not cellulitis at all? I should double-check for mimics such as venous stasis dermatitis, lymphedema, or contact dermatitis, especially in patients with chronic edema or skin changes. If the presentation is atypical or refractory to appropriate therapy, I need to reconsider the diagnosis and consider biopsy or alternative evaluations before escalating antibiotics [^112hv8YA] [^116gbTwp].

> Let me reconsider stewardship and cost-effectiveness. Cephalexin remains the most cost-effective empiric choice across a range of MRSA prevalence in nonpurulent cellulitis, reinforcing the principle of using the narrowest effective agent and avoiding routine MRSA coverage in the absence of risk factors [^116NBDgH].

> Final recommendation: Initiate outpatient therapy with cephalexin 500 mg orally every 6 hours for 5 days, extend to 7–10 days if not improved by day 5, provide limb elevation and toe-web care instructions, and arrange follow-up within 48–72 hours to confirm response and reassess the diagnosis if failing to improve [^116QtZHg] [^114pSATx] [^114NgcMq].

---

The most appropriate initial empiric antibiotic for this patient is **cephalexin 500 mg orally every 6 hours for 5–7 days** [^116QtZHg] because the presentation is nonpurulent cellulitis without systemic toxicity, where streptococci are the predominant pathogens and MRSA coverage is not routinely indicated [^114pSATx] [^112z7Dvu]. If there is no improvement within 48–72 hours, reassess for abscess, necrotizing infection, or MRSA and adjust therapy accordingly [^111pS5Gp] [^114pSATx].

---

## Clinical assessment and classification

The patient's presentation is consistent with **nonpurulent cellulitis** — characterized by erythema, warmth, swelling, and tenderness without purulent drainage or abscess formation [^112hv8YA]. The absence of systemic signs (fever, chills, malaise) and hemodynamic instability indicates mild infection severity, suitable for outpatient management [^111ek3cL].

---

## Pathogens commonly associated with nonpurulent cellulitis

Nonpurulent cellulitis is most commonly caused by **beta-hemolytic streptococci** (particularly group A Streptococcus) [^112hv8YA], with methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) as a less frequent pathogen [^114eeoYo]. MRSA is an unusual cause of nonpurulent cellulitis unless specific risk factors are present [^114eeoYo].

---

## Guideline recommendations for empiric antibiotic therapy

According to the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines, **empiric antibiotic therapy for nonpurulent cellulitis without systemic signs should primarily target streptococci** [^114pSATx]. Routine coverage for MRSA is not recommended unless specific risk factors are present [^112z7Dvu]. Recommended oral antibiotics include:

- **Penicillin V**: 500 mg orally every 6 hours
- **Amoxicillin**: 500 mg orally every 8 hours
- **Cephalexin**: 500 mg orally every 6 hours
- **Dicloxacillin**: 500 mg orally every 6 hours
- **Clindamycin**: 300–450 mg orally every 6–8 hours (for patients with beta-lactam allergy)

---

## Rationale for cephalexin as the preferred empiric therapy

Cephalexin, a first-generation cephalosporin, is the **preferred empiric therapy** in this patient for the following reasons:

- **Spectrum of activity**: Cephalexin provides excellent coverage against streptococci and MSSA, the most common pathogens in nonpurulent cellulitis [^112z7Dvu].
- **Safety profile**: Cephalexin is generally well-tolerated with minimal adverse effects, making it suitable for outpatient therapy.
- **Clinical evidence**: Studies have demonstrated high clinical success rates with cephalexin in treating uncomplicated cellulitis, supporting its use as first-line therapy [^112z7Dvu].

---

## Duration of therapy and follow-up

The recommended duration of therapy for uncomplicated cellulitis is **5–7 days**, with extension to 10–14 days if clinical improvement is not observed within 5 days [^116QtZHg]. Patients should be reassessed within 48–72 hours to ensure clinical improvement and adherence to therapy [^notfound].

---

## Indications for MRSA coverage

Routine MRSA coverage is not indicated in this patient. However, **MRSA coverage should be considered** if any of the following risk factors are present:

- **History of MRSA infection or colonization**
- **Recent hospitalization or long-term care residence**
- **Intravenous drug use**
- **Severe infection with systemic toxicity**
- **Failure of initial beta-lactam therapy**

In such cases, appropriate MRSA-active agents include clindamycin, doxycycline, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, or vancomycin, depending on clinical severity and patient factors [^1166kUD4].

---

## Adjunctive measures

Adjunctive measures to optimize outcomes include **elevation of the affected limb** to reduce edema, meticulous skin care, and treatment of predisposing factors such as tinea pedis or chronic edema [^114NgcMq]. These measures help reduce recurrence and improve clinical response [^114NgcMq].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended empiric therapy** | **Duration** |
|-|-|-|
| Nonpurulent cellulitis without systemic signs | Cephalexin 500 mg orally every 6 hours | 5–7 days |
| Beta-lactam allergy | Clindamycin 300–450 mg orally every 6–8 hours | 5–7 days |
| MRSA risk factors present | Clindamycin or doxycycline or TMP-SMX ± beta-lactam | 7–14 days |

---

The most appropriate initial empiric antibiotic for this patient is **cephalexin 500 mg orally every 6 hours for 5–7 days**, with reassessment at 48–72 hours to ensure clinical improvement.

### Reducing inappropriate investigations for minor lower limb cellulitis [^115z6nqP]. BMJ Open Quality (2025). High credibility.

Background

Lower limb cellulitis involves infection of the deep dermis and subcutaneous tissue, presenting as expanding erythema, warmth, tenderness and swelling. Despite being a frequently encountered condition in both the outpatient and inpatient settings, there is a lack of robustly developed and validated diagnostic criteria or tools for use in clinical practice, with no definitive diagnostic algorithm nor a clear biomarker. Routine biochemical and haematological blood tests and blood cultures are not specific for cellulitis. Radiography is not required unless there is clinical suspicion of osteomyelitis, history of trauma to the affected extremity or the presence of a chronic wound. The performance of unnecessary investigations leads to patient risks and wastes resources by potentially confusing the diagnosis and prolonging inpatient lengths of stays. Clinical decision support and evidence-based guidelines are hence key in empowering appropriate and rationalised decision-making in the management of patients with lower limb cellulitis.

Cellulitis, an infection involving the deep dermis and subcutaneous tissue, is the most common reason for skin-related hospitalization and is seen by clinicians across various disciplines in the inpatient, outpatient, and emergency room settings, but it can present as a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. Cellulitis is a clinical diagnosis based on the history of present illness and physical examination and lacks a gold standard for diagnosis. Clinical presentation with acute onset of redness, warmth, swelling, and tenderness and pain is typical. However, cellulitis can be difficult to diagnose due to a number of infectious and non-infectious clinical mimickers such as venous stasis dermatitis, contact dermatitis, eczema, lymphedema, and erythema migrans. Microbiological diagnosis is often unobtainable due to poor sensitivity of culture specimens. The majority of non-purulent, uncomplicated cases of cellulitis are caused by β-hemolytic streptococci or methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, and appropriate targeted coverage of this pathogen with oral antibiotics such as penicillin, amoxicillin, and cephalexin is sufficient. Even with rising rates of community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, coverage for non-purulent cellulitis is generally not recommended.

Case presentation

A morbidly obese African-American woman presented with acute cellulitis superimposed on chronic bilateral lower extremity lymphedema. At the time of admission, the patient stated that she had a history of stable lymphedema for over 3 years, but within the last week swelling in both legs increased, leading to severe pain, weakness and difficulty with ambulation. A day prior to presentation, she noticed white drainage from her left lower extremity prompting her to visit her local emergency department. She was found to be tachycardic, hypertensive, and febrile. Laboratory results were significant for an increased white cell count (WCC) (31 × 10⁹/L), mild liver dysfunction and acute renal failure. She was given acetaminophen, and intravenous fluids. Blood cultures were collected, and she was started on intravenous ceftriaxone. The patient was transferred to our hospital for further management of sepsis secondary to left lower extremity infection.

On presentation (day 1), she was hypertensive 199/73 mm Hg, tachycardic (103 bpm), with temperature of 37.8 C and saturating 98% on room air. On examination, she was alert and oriented to person, place and time. Her bilateral lower extremities were hyperpigmented, dry, scaly and thickened throughout. Significant bilateral pitting oedema was also present with circumferential induration. Numerous deep fissures, several containing maggots, were present in addition to purulent fluid leakage from the medial and plantar surfaces of both feet. Aside from severe pain and tenderness to palpation bilaterally, the patient denied any other symptoms. Initial labs were notable for an elevated lactic acid, creatinine and white WCC. No fluid collections or thromboses were present on imaging. Full infectious workup was ordered, and the patient was started on empiric antibiotic therapy with intravenous vancomycin, cefepime and metronidazole. On day 2, a one-time dosing of intravenous clindamycin was added for additional gram-positive coverage. Over the next 4 days, the patient's condition improved with resolution of her symptoms and haemodynamic instability. Her WCC steadily continued a downward trend to near-normal levels. Patient also reported decrease in pain in both legs.

Skin and soft tissue infections are a common cause of hospitalization and use of antibiotic therapy, and may result in significant disability. Infections managed by surgeons may vary from simple, noncomplicated cellulitis to severe necrotizing soft tissue infections. The differentiation of necrotizing infections from nonnecrotizing infections is critical to achieving adequate surgical therapy. An understanding of the changing epidemiology of all complicated skin and soft tissue infections is required for selection of appropriate empiric antibiotic therapy.

### World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) guidelines for management of skin and soft tissue infections [^111pS5Gp]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Therapy for community-acquired MRSA should be added for patients at risk for CA-MRSA and subsequently for patients who do not respond to beta-lactam therapy within 48 to 72 hours or who have chills, fever, a new abscess, increasing erythema, or uncontrolled pain.

Although in cellulitis, swabs and aspirates of the leading edge of the site of infection have a low yield of around 10%, when it is possible, antibiotic treatment should be modified, on the basis of antimicrobial susceptibilities of organisms obtained.

Simple abscesses

7) Incision and drainage is the primary treatment for a simple abscesses or boils. Antibiotics are not needed (Recommendation 1 C).

For a simple superficial abscess or boil, incision and drainage is the primary treatment, and antibiotics are not needed. Simple abscesses should not have extension into deeper tissues or multiloculated extension.

Complex abscesses

8) Complex skin and subcutaneous abscesses are typically well circumscribed and respond to incision and drainage. Antimicrobial therapy is required if systemic signs of sepsis are present, in immunocompromised patients, if source control is incomplete or for the abscesses with significant cellulitis (Recommendation 1 C).

9) Empiric antibiotic therapy should be directed toward the likely pathogens involved.

Therapy for community-acquired MRSA should be recommended for patients at risk for CA-MRSA (Recommendation 1 C).

10) Inadequate resolution should prompt consideration of further drainage, resistant pathogens, or host immune failure (Recommendation 1 C).

The cornerstone of treatment is early surgical drainage. Antimicrobial therapy is required if systemic signs of sepsis are present, in immunocompromised patients, if source control is incomplete or for the abscesses with significant cellulitis.

Complicated abscesses may involve a variety of pathogens. Aerobic gram-positive pathogens are isolated in most complicated abscesses. They may involve only a single pathogen but are frequently poly-microbial in origin and may involve a number of organisms.

Empiric antibiotic therapy should be directed toward the likely pathogens involved. Broad-spectrum agents with coverage of gram-positive, gram-negative, and anaerobic pathogens may be required depending on the clinical setting. Given the high frequency of MRSA, this pathogen should be empirically covered if it is suspected, but no randomized studies are available for the treatment of SSTI specifically caused by CA-MRSA.

Case descriptions

Case 1

A 74-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, prior cerebrovascular accident, type II diabetes mellitus, and warfarin use presented to the emergency department (ED) with swelling, pain, and redness in her lower portion of the left leg. Four weeks prior to presentation, the patient's daughter noticed bruising on the lower portion of the left leg in the absence of trauma. Within 2 days, the lower portion of the left leg became swollen, red, and tender, prompting the patient to escalate care. She was diagnosed with cellulitis and discharged on oral cephalexin with close outpatient follow up (Fig 1, A). The patient's symptoms persisted, and she received intravenous cefazolin and vancomycin during outpatient dialysis with no improvement. She represented to the ED, where dermatology was consulted. Physical examination revealed exquisitely painful retiform purpura of the left lower extremity with areas of induration and without warmth, characteristic of calciphylaxis (Fig 1, B).

### Predictors of failure of empiric outpatient antibiotic therapy in emergency department patients with uncomplicated cellulitis [^1175UPek]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Despite several expert panel recommendations and cellulitis treatment guidelines, there are currently no clinical decision rules to assist clinicians in deciding which emergency department (ED) patients should be treated with oral antibiotics and which patients require intravenous (IV) therapy at first presentation of cellulitis amenable to outpatient treatment.

Objectives

The objective was to determine risk factors associated with adult patients presenting to the ED with cellulitis who fail initial antibiotic therapy as outpatients and require a change of antibiotics or admission to hospital.

Methods

This was a prospective cohort study of patients 18 years of age or older presenting with cellulitis to one of two tertiary care EDs (combined annual census 140,000). Patients were excluded if they had been treated with antibiotics for the cellulitis before presenting to the ED, if they were admitted to the hospital, or if they had an abscess only. Trained research personnel administered a questionnaire at the initial ED visit with telephone follow-up 2 weeks later. Multivariable logistic regression models determined predictor variables independently associated with treatment failure (failed initial antibiotic therapy and required a change of antibiotics or admission to hospital).

Results

A total of 598 patients were enrolled, 52 were excluded, and 49 were lost to follow-up. The mean (± standard deviation [SD]) age was 53.1 (± 18.4) years and 56.4% were male. A total of 185 patients (37.2%) were given oral antibiotics, 231 (46.5%) were given IV antibiotics, and 81 patients (16.3%) received both oral and IV antibiotics in the ED. A total of 102 (20.5%, 95% confidence [CI] = 17.2% to 24.2%) patients had treatment failures. Fever (temperature > 38°C) at triage (odds ratio [OR] = 4.3, 95% CI = 1.6 to 11.7), chronic leg ulcers (OR = 2.5, 95% CI = 1.1 to 5.2), chronic edema or lymphedema (OR = 2.5, 95% CI = 1.5 to 4.2), prior cellulitis in the same area (OR = 2.1, 95% CI = 1.3 to 3.5), and cellulitis at a wound site (OR = 1.9, 95% CI = 1.2 to 3.0) were independently associated with treatment failure.

Conclusions

These risk factors should be considered when initiating empiric antibiotic therapy for ED patients with cellulitis amenable to outpatient treatment.

### Giant cellulitis-like sweet syndrome in association with chronic myeloid leukemia [^1125UC5V]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Case report

A 36-year-old obese man with chronic myeloid leukemia on dasatinib for 3 years and congestive heart failure presented with a 3-day history of fever, chills, diaphoresis, nausea, and painful erythema of the right axilla spreading toward the chest. The patient had no prior history of trauma or open wounds in the area. A physical examination revealed tachycardia, a fever of up to 101.8 °F, and large tender erythematous plaques on the inferior axilla and flank, as well as discontinuous erythematous plaques on the chest (Fig 1, A and B). Laboratory evaluation demonstrated a leukocytosis with a significant left shift (172,000 white blood cells per mL, 64% neutrophils, and 34% bands). Upon surgical exploration, there was no evidence of necrotizing soft tissue infection, abscess, or fluid collection. Empiric intravenous vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and metronidazole were started for a presumptive diagnosis of cellulitis. Despite antibiotic treatment, the patient experienced worsening pain and erythema.

Fig 1
Large, irregular, erythematous and edematous plaques over the chest (A) and flank (B) at presentation.

The morphology and distribution of plaques in a patient with obesity, history of myeloid leukemia, and lack of response to antibiotics led to consideration of a variant of SS. A skin biopsy was obtained, and treatment with systemic corticosteroids was initiated. Histopathology demonstrated dermal edema with a superficial and deep perivascular and interstitial neutrophilic infiltrate (Fig 2, A and B) extending into the subcutis, findings more typical of cellulitis than of SS. After initiating prednisone 1 mg/kg/d on the fourth day of hospitalization, the pain and edema improved rapidly. Upon follow-up 1 week later, the eruption resolved (Fig 3, A and B). The final treatment plan was to taper prednisone over 8 weeks; the patient received concomitant trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole for Pneumocystis pneumonia prophylaxis.

The terms "complicated" and "uncomplicated" persist and can be useful in describing SSTIs as reported by Napolitano.

Uncomplicated SSTIs carry low risk for life- or limb-threatening infection unless they are improperly treated. Patients who have uncomplicated SSTIs can be treated with either empiric antibiotic therapy according to the most probable pathogen and local resistance patterns in impetigo, erysipelas, or mild cellulitis with drainage and debridement or simple surgical drainage in skin abscess.

Complicated SSTIs are associated with high risk for life-threatening infection. In patients who have complicated SSTIs, it is of paramount importance to initiate appropriate and adequate broad-spectrum initial empiric antibiotic therapy and to consider the need for surgical intervention for drainage and/or debridement.

In 2003, Eron et al. classified SSTIs according to the severity of local and systemic signs and the presence or absence of comorbid conditions in patients presenting in the outpatient setting to guide the clinical management, treatment, and admission decisions. In this classification system, SSTIs were divided in four classes:
Class 1: patients with SSTI, but no signs or symptoms of systemic toxicity or co-morbidities.
Class 2: patients are either systemically unwell with stable co-morbidities or are systemically well, but have a comorbidity (e.g. diabetes, obesity) that may complicate or delay resolution.
Class 3: patients appear toxic and unwell (fever, tachycardia, tachypnoea, and/or hypotension).
Class 4: patients have sepsis syndrome and life-threatening infection; for example necrotizing fasciitis.

Case Presentation

A 65-year-old man presented with shortness of breath, gradually worsening for the previous 2 weeks, associated with dry cough, sore throat, and diarrhea. He denied fever, chills, chest pain, abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting. He did not have any sick contacts or travel history outside of Michigan. His medical history included hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, morbid obesity, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and tobacco use. He was taking amiodarone, carvedilol, furosemide, pregabalin, and insulin. The patient appeared to be in mild respiratory distress. He was afebrile and had saturation at 93% on 3 L of oxygen, heart rate of 105 beats/min, BP of 145/99 mm Hg, and respiratory rate of 18 breaths/min. On auscultation, there were crackles on bilateral lung bases and chronic bilateral leg swelling with hyperpigmented changes. His WBC count was 6.0 K/cumm (3.5 to 10.6 K/cumm) with absolute lymphocyte count 0.7 K/cumm (1.0 to 3.8 K/cumm); serum creatinine was 2.81 mg/dL (0.7 to 1.3 mg/dL). He had elevated inflammatory markers (serum ferritin, C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, D-dimer, and creatinine phosphokinase). Chest radiography showed bilateral pulmonary opacities that were suggestive of multifocal pneumonia (Fig 1). Nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 was positive. Therapy was started with ceftriaxone, doxycycline, hydroxychloroquine, and methylprednisolone 1 mg/kg IV for 3 days. By day 3 of hospitalization, he required endotracheal intubation, vasopressor support, and continuous renal replacement. Blood cultures were negative; respiratory cultures revealed only normal oral flora, so antibiotic therapy was discontinued. On day 10, WBC count increased to 28 K/cumm, and chest radiography showed persistent bilateral opacities with left lower lobe consolidation. Repeat respiratory cultures grew Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Table 1). Antibiotic therapy with IV meropenem was started. His condition steadily improved; eventually by day 20, he was off vasopressors and was extubated. However, on day 23, he experienced significant hemoptysis that required reintubation and vasopressor support.

Cellulitis treatment — antibiotic selection and duration — states that therapy for typical cases should include an antibiotic active against streptococci; many patients can start oral therapy, and suitable options include penicillin, amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, dicloxacillin, cephalexin, or clindamycin. In uncomplicated cellulitis, a 5-day course of antimicrobial therapy is as effective as a 10-day course if clinical improvement has occurred by 5 days; in hospitalized cellulitis/abscess, the average duration was 2 weeks, only about one-third received specific gram-positive therapy, two-thirds received very-broad-spectrum treatment, and the failure rate of 12% was not different regardless of spectrum of treatment.

### 2018 WSES / SIS-E consensus conference: recommendations for the management of skin and soft-tissue infections [^116VEGCz]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

What is the appropriate treatment of superficial infections (impetigo, erysipelas and cellulitis, and superficial abscesses)?

We recommend that impetigo, erysipelas, and cellulitis should be managed by antibiotics against Gram-positive bacteria (recommendation 1C).

Empiric therapy for community-acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA) should be recommended for patients at risk for CA-MRSA or who do not respond to first line therapy (recommendation 1C).

Incision and drainage is the primary treatment for simple abscesses or boils. We recommend not to use antibiotics for simple abscesses or boils (recommendation 1C).

Superficial infections encompass either superficial spreading infection and inflammation within the epidermis and dermis that may be treated with antibiotics alone or a well-circumscribed abscess that may be treated by drainage alone.

Physical examination usually reveals erythema, tenderness, and induration. The majority of superficial SSTIs are caused by Gram-positive bacteria, particularly streptococci and S. aureus. The three common presentations of superficial infections consist of impetigo, erysipelas, and cellulitis. They are managed by antibiotic therapy against Gram-positive bacteria.

Impetigo is a highly contagious bacterial infection of the superficial layers of the epidermis. Impetigo predominantly affects children, and it is one of the most common SSTI in children worldwide. It is characterized by discrete purulent lesions nearly always caused by β-hemolytic Streptococcus spp. and/or S. aureus. Moreover, of particular concern is the rising role of CA-MRSA as impetigo's etiological agent.

Erysipelas is a fiery red, tender, painful plaque with well-demarcated edges and is commonly caused by streptococcal species, usually Staphylococcus pyogenes. S. aureus rarely causes erysipelas. Streptococci are the primary cause of erysipelas. Most facial infections are attributed to group A Streptococcus (GAS), with an increasing percentage of lower extremity infections being caused by non-GAS. The role of S. aureus, and specifically MRSA, remains controversial.

Case 1

An 80-year-old Chinese man with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia presented with a 1-month history of left lower limb erythema and swelling. There was no fever or pain. Investigations did not show any leukocytosis or elevated C-reactive protein. Cellulitis was diagnosed, and the patient was treated with intravenous co-amoxiclav. There was no clinical improvement over 3 days, and a dermatology consult was sought. Examination found confluent, erythematous, infiltrated plaques with a nodular surface, circumferentially affecting the entire left leg from the lower thigh to the medial malleolus (Fig 1). There was no warmth or tenderness. Palpable ipsilateral, large and matted, inguinal lymphadenopathy was detected. An incisional skin biopsy found a dense, diffuse infiltrate within the dermis and subcutis (Fig 2, A). This infiltrate consisted of large, atypical neoplastic cells with round nuclei (centroblasts and immunoblasts) admixed with small reactive lymphocytes (Fig 2, B). The neoplastic cells expressed B-cell marker CD20 (Fig 2, C), and were strongly positive for Bcl-2 (Fig 2, D). The cells showed partial positive staining for MUM-1 (Fig 2, E). There was a high Ki-67 proliferative index of more than 90% (Fig 2, F). These findings were compatible with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL).

### Skin and soft tissue infections [^112EmR9h]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Skin and soft tissue infections result from microbial invasion of the skin and its supporting structures. Management is determined by the severity and location of the infection and by patient comorbidities. Infections can be classified as simple (uncomplicated) or complicated (necrotizing or nonnecrotizing), or as suppurative or nonsuppurative. Most community-acquired infections are caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and beta-hemolytic streptococcus. Simple infections are usually monomicrobial and present with localized clinical findings. In contrast, complicated infections can be mono- or polymicrobial and may present with systemic inflammatory response syndrome. The diagnosis is based on clinical evaluation. Laboratory testing may be required to confirm an uncertain diagnosis, evaluate for deep infections or sepsis, determine the need for inpatient care, and evaluate and treat comorbidities. Initial antimicrobial choice is empiric, and in simple infections should cover Staphylococcus and Streptococcus species. Patients with complicated infections, including suspected necrotizing fasciitis and gangrene, require empiric polymicrobial antibiotic coverage, inpatient treatment, and surgical consultation for debridement. Superficial and small abscesses respond well to drainage and seldom require antibiotics. Immunocompromised patients require early treatment and antimicrobial coverage for possible atypical organisms.

### Diabetic foot disorders. A clinical practice guideline (2006 revision) [^1113RHL3]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2007). Medium credibility.

Diabetic foot infections — empiric initiation, culture guidance, and monitoring: Reliable specimens for cultures may be obtained through curettage of the infected ulcer, and oral antibiotic therapy is usually sufficient as initial therapy. Antimicrobial treatment should be started as soon as possible with an agent providing adequate gram positive coverage, recognizing that gram negative organisms might also be involved. Although the incidence of MRSA infections has increased, methicillin-sensitive S aureus (MSSA) remains the most likely pathogen in community-acquired diabetic foot infections; therefore, initial antibiotic coverage must be tailored to cover MSSA unless culture/sensitivity or pathogen history indicates specific coverage, and antibiotics should be adjusted according to culture results and the patient's response to treatment. While many useful oral agents such as cephalexin, clindamycin, amoxicillin/clavulanate, and levofloxacin are available for mild to moderate infections, relatively few have been studied or have demonstrated superiority and IDSA guidelines contain no specific recommendations. All antibiotic treatments should be monitored for development of resistance, and most cases of cellulitis respond within 3 to 5 days of initiation of appropriate antibiotics; if cellulitis is slow to respond, worsens, or recurs following several days of treatment, the ulceration should be reassessed and possibly reevaluated. Bacteria frequently develop resistance, especially with prolonged therapy, which is not uncommon with the quinolones.

### 2018 WSES / SIS-E consensus conference: recommendations for the management of skin and soft-tissue infections [^114aexux]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

NSTI type II is a mono-microbial infection. Among Gram-positive organisms, GAS remains the most common pathogen, followed by MRSA. Unlike type I infections, type II infections may occur in any age group and in persons without any underlying illness. Other pathogens include Aeromonas hydrophila and V. vulnificus. Mono-microbial necrotizing fasciitis due to Gram-negative pathogens (bacteroides and E. coli) have also been reported, though these infections are typically seen in immunocompromised, diabetic, obese, and postoperative patients.

Gas gangrene (clostridial myonecrosis), or type III NSTI, is an acute infection by clostridium or bacillus of healthy living tissue that occurs spontaneously or as a result of traumatic injury. Recurrent gas gangrene, occurring several decades after the primary infection, has also been described.

The use of antimicrobial therapy is an adjuvant treatment and must be combined with early surgical debridement. Once the diagnosis is made and blood cultures have been drawn, broad-spectrum coverage should be urgently commenced. Initial antibiotic therapy for necrotizing infections is empirical in nature because microbiological data (culture and susceptibility results) may require > 24 h before they are available for a more detailed analysis.

Since it is impossible to exclude with certainty a polymicrobial necrotizing infection, an aggressive broad-spectrum empiric antimicrobial therapy should initially be selected to cover Gram-positive, Gram-negative, and anaerobic organisms until culture-specific results and sensitivities are available. An acceptable empiric antibiotic regimen should always include antibiotics, which cover MRSA with the additional benefit of inhibiting invasive GAS virulence proteins. For the treatment of MRSA, we refer to the previous paragraphs.

For the treatment of Gram-negative bacteria, the use of piperacillin-tazobactam in the setting without high local prevalence of ESBL-producing Enterobacateriaceae optimizing pharmacokinetic / pharmacodynamic parameters is appropriate. Carbapenems, administered in adequate dosage, including meropenem, imipenem-cilastatin, or doripenem may be used in the settings with high local prevalence of ESBL-producing Enterobacateriaceae. Culture-specific results and sensitivities can direct both broadening of antimicrobial regimen if it is too narrow and a de-escalation if it is too broad particularly in critically ill patients where de-escalation strategy is one of the cornerstones of antimicrobial stewardship programs. The choice of anti-Gram-negative treatment should be based on local prevalence of ESBL-producing Enterobacateriaceae and MDRO non-fermenters.

Skin and soft tissue infections are among the most common reasons for people to seek medical advice. They also represent one of the most common indications for antimicrobial therapy and account for approximately 7–10% of hospitalisations in North America. Although non-limb and non-life threatening infections may be treated on an out-patient basis with oral antibiotics, patients with more serious acute skin and soft tissue infections may require admission to hospital for management; this decision is especially true if the infection is rapidly progressive. We provide a concise overview of the differential diagnosis and approach to management of community-acquired rapidly progressive skin and soft tissue infections.

Case report

A 63-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and diabetes was evaluated by the inpatient dermatology service for a 3-week history of severe left lower extremity swelling, tenderness, and evolving erythema and hyperpigmentation. The patient had a 10-year history of venous insufficiency, left lower extremity swelling, and discomfort. She had undergone endovenous ablation of the left great saphenous vein several years before with some symptom improvement at the time; however, her symptoms had recently worsened. On admission, physical examination of the left leg found significant hyperpigmentation, erythema, tenderness, and edema (Fig 1) along with intact strength and sensation and strong distal pulses. Venous duplex studies found no deep venous thromboses, minimal deep venous reflux, and some superficial varicose veins. The patient was treated for acute LDS with a prednisone taper and completed a course of antibiotics for possible cellulitis, with improvement during her hospital stay.

Fig 1
A, Initial clinical appearance of the left lower extremity. B, Clinical appearance of the left lower extremity 1 year after left iliac vein venoplasty and stenting.

At outpatient follow-up, the patient reported continued severe left lower extremity pain and swelling and poor ambulatory function. She did not tolerate compression therapy because of pain. She completed her prednisone course and was started on pentoxifylline. She was referred to a vascular surgeon who recommended a venogram study be performed by the interventional radiology department to assess the venous drainage of her left lower extremity.

She subsequently required another hospitalization for severe left lower extremity pain, swelling, and erythema greatly affecting her ability to ambulate. She improved with leg elevation, antibiotics, and prednisone. Hydroxychloroquine was added to her regimen of pentoxifylline, 400 mg 3 times a day. Notably, during both of her admissions, she had no fevers, normal white blood cell counts, and negative blood cultures. Magnetic resonance imaging of the left lower extremity found diffuse mild subcutaneous edema and fluid and skin thickening predominantly in the mid to lower calf, both concerning for possible cellulitis.

Non-limb-threatening diabetic foot infections — treatment of diabetic foot infections is guided by the severity of the infection, and non-limb-threatening infections involve superficial ulcerations without significant ischemia and they do not involve bone or joint. Typically, cellulitis does not extend 2 cm beyond the ulcer margins and there is an absence of systemic symptoms (e.g. fever, chills, nausea, vomiting). These less severe infections that frequently complicate diabetic foot ulcers may be initially treated in an outpatient setting.

### Skin and soft tissue infections in the emergency department [^115joSCW]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

This article covers the diagnosis and treatment of skin and soft tissue infections commonly encountered in the emergency department: impetigo, cutaneous abscesses, purulent cellulitis, nonpurulent cellulitis, and necrotizing skin and soft tissue infections. Most purulent infections in the United States are caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. For abscesses, we emphasize the importance of incision and drainage. Nonpurulent infections are usually caused by streptococcal species and initial empiric antibiotics need not cover methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. For uncommon but potentially lethal necrotizing skin and soft tissue infections, the challenge is rapid diagnosis in the emergency department and prompt surgical exploration and debridement.

### 2018 WSES / SIS-E consensus conference: recommendations for the management of skin and soft-tissue infections [^117TCaKG]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

What antibiotics are recommended for empiric treatment of clinically suspected necrotizing infections?

Antibiotic treatment of necrotizing infections should be prompt and aggressive (recommendation 1B).

The initial empirical antibiotic regimen should comprise broad-spectrum drugs including anti-MRSA and anti-Gram-negative coverage (recommendation 1C).

Vancomycin treatment should be avoided in patients with renal impairment and when MRSA isolate shows a MIC for vancomycin ≥ 1.5 mg/mL (recommendation 1B).

Daptomycin or linezolid are drugs of choice for empirical anti-MRSA coverage. Alternatively, ceftaroline, telavancin, tedizolid, and dalbavacin can be used (recommendation 2C).

The choice of anti-Gram-negative treatment should be based on local prevalence of ESBL-producing Enterobacateriaceae and multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) non-fermenters (recommendation 1B).

De-escalation of antibiotic therapy should be based on clinical improvement, cultured pathogens, and results of rapid diagnostic tests where available (recommendation 1C).

Microbiologically, NSTIs have been classified as either type 1 (polymicrobial) or type 2 (mono-microbial) or type 3 (gas gangrene). Occasionally in immunocompromised patients, NSTIs may be also caused by mycotic species.

NSTIs type I is a polymicrobial infection involving aerobic and anaerobic organisms. It is usually seen in the elderly or in those with underlying illnesses. Type I infection is often associated with gas in the tissue and thus is difficult to distinguish from gas gangrene. Non-clostridial anaerobic cellulitis and synergistic necrotizing cellulitis are type I variants. Both occur in patients with diabetes and typically involve the feet, with rapid extension into the leg.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^114pSATx]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Erysipelas and cellulitis — evaluation and treatment recommendations are as follows: Cultures of blood or cutaneous aspirates, biopsies, or swabs are not routinely recommended (strong, moderate). Cultures of blood are recommended (strong, moderate), and cutaneous and microscopic examination of cutaneous aspirates, biopsies, or swabs should be considered in patients with malignancy on chemotherapy, neutropenia, severe cell-mediated immunodeficiency, immersion injuries, and animal bites (weak, moderate). Typical cases of cellulitis without systemic signs of infection should receive an antimicrobial agent that is active against streptococci (mild; Figure 1) (strong, moderate). For cellulitis with systemic signs of infection (moderate nonpurulent SSTI; Figure 1) systemic antibiotics are indicated. Many clinicians could include coverage against MSSA (weak, low). For patients whose cellulitis is associated with penetrating trauma, evidence of MRSA infection elsewhere, nasal colonization with MRSA, injection drug use, or SIRS (severe nonpurulent; Figure 1), vancomycin or another antimicrobial effective against both MRSA and streptococci is recommended (strong, moderate). In severely compromised patients (as defined in question 13), broad-spectrum antimicrobial coverage may be considered (weak, moderate). Vancomycin plus either piperacillin-tazobactam or imipenem-meropenem is recommended as a reasonable empiric regimen for severe infection (strong, moderate). The recommended duration of antimicrobial therapy is 5 days, but treatment should be extended if the infection has not improved within this time period (strong, high). Elevation of the affected area and treatment of predisposing factors, such as edema or underlying cutaneous disorders, are recommended (strong, moderate). In lower extremity cellulitis, clinicians should carefully examine the interdigital toe spaces because treating fissuring, scaling, or maceration may eradicate colonization with pathogens and reduce the incidence of recurrent infection (strong, moderate). Outpatient therapy is recommended for patients who do not have SIRS, altered mental status, or hemodynamic instability (mild nonpurulent; Figure 1) (strong, moderate). Hospitalization is recommended if there is concern for a deeper or necrotizing infection, for patients with poor adherence to therapy, for infection in a severely immunocompromised patient, or if outpatient treatment is failing (moderate or severe nonpurulent; Figure 1) (strong, moderate).

### Bilateral lower extremity inflammatory lymphedema after an ultramarathon [^112SQW9H]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Case report

A 54-year-old male ultramarathoner presented with severe swelling, redness, and pain in bilateral lower extremities. Symptoms began a few hours after finishing a 100-mile trail-running race in eastern Texas. The race occurred in February, with ambient temperatures ranging from 44 to 76 °F. The swelling progressively worsened, and he presented to the clinic approximately 3 days after finishing. He reported having run almost continuously for > 30 hours but denied any specific injury. He denied any changes in urine color, fever, severe/focal pain, or numbness/tingling. He reported running 3 prior races of 100+ miles but denied any history of similar symptoms. His medical and surgical histories were unremarkable.

The patient arrived in a wheelchair but transitioned to the examination table unassisted. His vital signs were normal, and he was in no distress. Upon inspection, prominent 4+ pitting edemas and moderate diffuse erythema and warmth were noted from the knees to the toes bilaterally (Fig 1). There was no purpura. The knees, ankles, and feet were nontender, and there was only mild tenderness to palpation of the lower leg muscular compartments. There was mild pain on passive ankle dorsiflexion and plantarflexion. Strength testing revealed mild weakness (4+/5) in ankle dorsiflexion and plantarflexion. Neurovascular examination was unremarkable.

Fig 1
Photographs taken of the patient's legs on day 5 after completion of the 100-mile ultramarathon race. Mild confluent erythema and pitting edema, with lack of petechiae or purpura.

Initial laboratory testing revealed a serum creatine kinase (CK) level of 5800 U/L and urinalysis positive for protein (30 mg/dL). Urine was negative for hemoglobin, and only rare red blood cells were present in sediment. A basic metabolic panel and complete blood cell count were completely normal.

Bilateral tibia/fibula x-rays were normal. Ultrasound of the lower legs showed widespread thickening of the subdermal adipose layer with prominent streaky anechoic signal interspersed among the hypoechoic fat lobules bilaterally and mild anechoic tenosynovial effusion of the anterior, medial, and lateral ankle tendons. Muscles in all 4 compartments demonstrated normal architecture throughout.

Surgical site infections

1) Surgical site infections require prompt and wide opening of the surgical incision. Antimicrobial therapy is recommended for deep incisional surgical site infections if systemic signs of sepsis are present, if source control is incomplete or in immunocompromised patients (Recommendation 1 C).

2) In patients who have had clean operations, antimicrobial therapy should cover gram-positive organisms; in contrast, in patients who have had procedures on the gastrointestinal or genitourinary tract antimicrobial therapy should cover both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms (Recommendation 1 C).

Surgical site infections are caused by a variety of organisms.

The pathogens isolated from infections differ, primarily depending on the type of surgical procedure. In clean surgical procedures, in which the gastrointestinal, gynecologic, and respiratory tracts have not been entered, Staphylococcus aureus from the exogenous environment or the patient's skin flora is the usual cause of infection. In other categories of surgical procedures, including clean-contaminated, contaminated, and dirty, the polymicrobial aerobic and anaerobic flora closely resembling the normal endogenous microflora of the surgically resected organ are the most frequently isolated pathogens.

Treatment involves widely opening the incision. Antimicrobial therapy is required in deep infections if systemic signs of toxicity are present, if source control is incomplete or in immunocompromised patients. Broad-spectrum empiric antimicrobial therapy should initially be selected to cover potentially resistant pathogens. Cultures should be always obtained and antimicrobial therapy modified based on the culture and sensitivity results.

Non necrotizing superficial infections

3) Erysipelas, and cellulitis are managed by antimicrobial therapy against Gram-positive bacteria (Recommendation 1 C).

4) Lack of clinical response for cellulitis may be due to resistant strains of staphylococcus or streptococcus, or deeper processes, such as necrotizing fasciitis or myonecrosis (Recommendation 1 C).

5) Therapy for community-acquired MRSA should be recommended for patients at risk for CA-MRSA or who do not respond to beta-lactam therapy within 48 to 72 hours (Recommendation 1 C).

6) If a streptococcal toxic shock syndrome is suspected, an antiribosomal agent such as clindamycin or linezolid can be used to reduce exotoxin and superantigen production (Recommendation 1 C).

A 55-year-old man undergoing chemotherapy for recurrent multiple myeloma presented with a 2-day history of bilateral lower leg rash with pain and oedema. On examination, there were numerous non-palpable retiform pruritic patches over both lower legs. Skin pnch biopsy demonstrated a diffuse interstitial neutrophilic infiltrate with necrosis. Peripheral blood and skin tissue cultures both isolated Citrobacterfreundii, consistent with a rare form of ecthyma gangrenosum. The patient responded with appropriate antibiotic therapy and removal of medical port. He made a full recovery from this infectious complication of his underlying immunosuppression.

Antimicrobial therapy

17) Early appropriate empiric coverage against suspected pathogens should be initiated, based upon the clinical setting for patients with NSTI (Recommendation 1 C).

18) Patients whose clinical setting or gram stain suggests rapidly progressive infection potentiated by exotoxins from Gram positive pathogens (S. pyogenes, CA-MRSA, Clostridial species), treatment with antimicrobial agents should be combined with antiribosomal agents (clindamycin or linezolid). Patients who present with rapidly progressive infections with gram stains of tissue demonstrating gram negative pathogens (Aeromonas sp. Eikenella, Vibrio sp) should be treated with antiribosomal agents targeting gram negative pathogens (tetracyclines) (Recommendation 1 C).

19) Appropriate empiric coverage against MRSA should be immediately initiated in patients with necrotizing soft tissue infection (Recommendation 1 C).

20) Since it is impossible to exclude with certainty a polymicrobial necrotizing infection, an aggressive broad-spectrum empiric antimicrobial therapy should initially be selected to cover gram-positive, gram-negative, and anaerobic organisms until culture-specific results and sensitivities are available (Recommendation 1 C).

21) An appropriate de-escalation of antimicrobial therapy is suggested once culture results return (Recommendation 1 C).

Microbiologically, NSTIs have been classified as either type 1 (polymicrobial) or type 2 (mono-microbial) or type 3 (mono-microbial infections initiated by a variety of virulent gram positive or gram negative bacilli such as Clostridia, Vibrio, Aeromonas, Eikenella, and Bacillus species). Occasionally in immunocompromised patients NSTIs may be also caused by mycotic species.

### Pediatric necrotizing soft tissue infection: unveiling a rare complication of routine procedures-peripheral venous catheter insertion [^115P1zpz]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Source control, achieved through early and complete debridement, remains the cornerstone of NSTI treatment. Antimicrobial therapy, providing broad-spectrum coverage and considering specific pathogens, serves as a crucial adjunct to source control. Early and aggressive antibiotic therapy is crucial and should be initiated concomitantly with surgical evaluation and treatment. Prompt blood cultures and deep tissue, abscess, or operative cultures aid in tailoring antibiotic therapy based on culture results. Empiric therapy should encompass broad-spectrum coverage, considering the polymicrobial nature of infections. This includes an MRSA-active agent and a broad-spectrum agent against gram-negative pathogens, along with anaerobic activity. Considerations such as the use of tigecycline in patients previously colonized with resistant bacteria and avoiding empiric use of certain agents in areas with high resistance prevalence are crucial. While not essential empirically, antifungal therapy may be added upon evidence of fungal elements in cultures. Tailoring therapy based on culture results, with consideration for discontinuation of MRSA-active agents guided by negative predictive value, is emphasized. The duration of therapy, not extensively studied, is suggested to continue for a minimum of 48–72 h after resolution of fever, systemic signs, and hemodynamic stabilization. IDSA practice guidelines for skin and soft tissue infections provide additional details on antibiotic therapy for NSTI.

Cellulitis

Cellulitis is an acute bacterial infection primarily of the dermal lymphatics and the subcutaneous tissue that most commonly affects the lower extremities, although it can affect other areas. It causes local signs of inflammation, such as warmth, erythema, pain, lymphangitis, and frequently systemic upset impact with fever and raised white blood cell count. Outpatient therapy should be recommended for patients with adherence to therapy, who do not have general signs of inflammation or hemodynamic instability.

Patients with a previous attack of cellulitis, especially involving the legs, can present recurrences. The infection usually occurs in the same area as the previous episode. edema, especially lymphedema, venous insufficiency, prior trauma (including surgery) to the area, and tinea pedis can increase the frequency of recurrences. Addressing these factors may decrease the frequency of recurrences.

The pathogens involved are streptococci and S. aureus. Cellulitis associated with abscesses is usually caused by S. aureus. In contrast, typical (non-purulent) cellulitis is most commonly caused by both streptococcal species and S. aureus. MRSA is an unusual cause of typical cellulitis.

In neutropenic and immunocompromised patients, Gram-negative bacteria should be considered.

Treatment
Antibiotic therapy for 5 days. You may extend therapy up to 7–10 days if lack of symptom resolution at 5 days.

### AABIP evidence-informed guidelines and expert panel report for the management of indwelling pleural catheters [^117X55Nh]. Journal of Bronchology & Interventional Pulmonology (2020). High credibility.

Indwelling pleural catheter (IPC) skin and tunnel infections — clinical features, organisms, and management are described as follows: Cellulitis is characterized by redness, warmth, edema, and mild pain of the skin and immediate subcutaneous tissue, exit-site infections are defined as purulent drainage at the catheter-epidermal interface, and tunnel tract infections are defined as erythema, edema, induration and tenderness along the catheter tract, > 2 cm proximal from the exit site; some also advocate using ultrasound to demonstrate a fluid collection along the catheter tract surrounding the cuff as additional diagnostic support. The appropriate management of IPC-related soft tissue infections has not been studied and recommendations are based on indirect evidence and expert opinion; the microbiology of cutaneous infections associated with IPCs has not been well characterized, but within peritoneal dialysis catheter literature the most common organisms include Corynebacterium species and coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, as well as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. In peritoneal dialysis catheter patients, oral antibiotics covering S. aureus species are typically sufficient, whereas patients with a history of pseudomonas infections or methicillin-resistant S. aureus might require more broad coverage; antibiotics alone are typically sufficient for these infections, though progression may warrant catheter removal, and in a review of 448 IPCs for malignant pleural effusions 14 localized skin infections were identified of which only 2 required catheter removal.

Patient 2

A 79-year-old woman with a history of adenocarcinoma of the pancreatic head with liver metastases presented with bilateral lower extremity edema and pain. Her initial treatment regimen included nivolumab, gemcitabine, and abraxane; however, nivolumab was discontinued secondary to severe infusion hypersensitivity reaction. Two weeks after receiving her second dose of gemcitabine and Abraxane, she had 2+ edema, tenderness, and mild erythema of the bilateral lower extremities (Fig 2). The patient was admitted for presumed cellulitis, and, after no improvement with empiric sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, she was referred to the Yale Onco-Dermatology Clinic. The leading diagnosis was changed to gemcitabine-associated ALDS-like eruption, and the patient was treated with compression therapy, high-potency topical steroids twice daily, discontinuation of antibiotics, and resumption of gemcitabine. Follow-up 1 week later found resolution of the erythema and tenderness, with mild residual edema. She was encouraged to use compression socks daily for maintenance therapy and leg elevation as often as possible.

### Label: METOPROLOL SUCCINATE tablet, extended release… [^112FUWaS]. FDA (DailyMed) (2024). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE Metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets, metoprolol succinate, is a beta-adrenergic blocker indicated for the treatment of:

- Hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions.
- Angina Pectoris.
- Heart Failure, to reduce the risk of cardiovascular mortality and heart failure hospitalizations in patients with heart failure. FULL PRESCRIBING INFORMATION: CONTENTS* 1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE 1. 1 Hypertension

1. 2 Angina Pectoris 1. 3 Heart Failure 2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
2. 1 Hypertension 2. 2 Angina Pectoris
2. 3 Heart Failure 2. 4 Administration.

If angina markedly worsens or acute coronary insufficiency develops, metoprolol succinate extended-release administration should be reinstated promptly, at least temporarily, and other measures appropriate for the management of unstable angina should be taken. Warn patients against interruption or discontinuation of therapy without the physician's advice. Because coronary artery disease is common and may be unrecognized, it may be prudent not to discontinue metoprolol succinate extended-release therapy abruptly even in patients treated only for hypertension. 1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE.

1. 1 Hypertension Metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets are indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure lowers the risk of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions.

These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes including metoprolol. Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly. Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit.

Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension, and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal. Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects. These considerations may guide selection of therapy. Metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets may be administered with other antihypertensive agents.
2. **1 Hypertension Adults**: The usual initial dosage is 25 mg to 100 mg daily in a single dose. Adjust dosage at weekly intervals until optimum blood pressure reduction is achieved.

### Anagrelide [^113o13ck]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.1 Cardiovascular Toxicity

Torsades de pointes and ventricular tachycardia have been reported with anagrelide. Obtain a pre-treatment cardiovascular examination including an ECG in all patients. During treatment with anagrelide monitor patients for cardiovascular effects and evaluate as necessary.

Anagrelide increases the QTc interval of the electrocardiogram and increases the heart rate in healthy volunteers [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

Do not use anagrelide in patients with known risk factors for QT interval prolongation, such as congenital long QT syndrome, a known history of acquired QTc prolongation, medicinal products that can prolong QTc interval and hypokalemia [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

Hepatic impairment increases anagrelide exposure and could increase the risk of QTc prolongation. Monitor patients with hepatic impairment for QTc prolongation and other cardiovascular adverse reactions. The potential risks and benefits of anagrelide therapy in a patient with mild and moderate hepatic impairment should be assessed before treatment is commenced. Reduce anagrelide dose in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. Avoid use of anagrelide in patients with severe hepatic impairment.

In patients with heart failure, bradyarrhythmias, or electrolyte abnormalities, consider periodic monitoring with electrocardiograms [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

Anagrelide is a phosphodiesterase 3 (PDE3) inhibitor and may cause vasodilation, tachycardia, palpitations, and congestive heart failure. Other drugs that inhibit PDE3 have caused decreased survival when compared with placebo in patients with Class III-IV congestive heart failure [see Drug Interactions (7.2)].

In patients with cardiac disease, use anagrelide only when the benefits outweigh the risks.

5.2 Pulmonary Hypertension

Cases of pulmonary hypertension have been reported in patients treated with anagrelide. Evaluate patients for signs and symptoms of underlying cardiopulmonary disease prior to initiating and during anagrelide therapy [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

5.3 Bleeding Risk

Use of concomitant anagrelide and aspirin increased major hemorrhagic events in a postmarketing study. Assess the potential risks and benefits for concomitant use of anagrelide with aspirin, since bleeding risks may be increased. Monitor patients for bleeding, including those receiving concomitant therapy with other drugs known to cause bleeding (e.g., anticoagulants, PDE3 inhibitors, NSAIDs, antiplatelet agents, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) [see Drug Interactions (7.3), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Aztreonam [^115n8BiX]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Concurrent Therapy

Concurrent initial therapy with other antimicrobial agents and aztreonam for injection is recommended before the causative organism(s) is known in seriously ill patients who are also at risk of having an infection due to Gram-positive aerobic pathogens. If anaerobic organisms are also suspected as etiologic agents, therapy should be initiated using an anti-anaerobic agent concurrently with aztreonam for injection (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Certain antibiotics (eg, cefoxitin, imipenem) may induce high levels of beta-lactamase in vitro in some Gram-negative aerobes such as Enterobacter and Pseudomonas species, resulting in antagonism to many beta-lactam antibiotics including aztreonam. These in vitro findings suggest that such beta-lactamase inducing antibiotics not be used concurrently with aztreonam. Following identification and susceptibility testing of the causative organism(s), appropriate antibiotic therapy should be continued.

### Antibiotic therapy in necrotizing soft tissue infections: a narrative review of the greater paris SURFAST consortium [^115ULRtz]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Necrotizing soft tissue infections (NSTIs) are uncommon, yet rapidly progressive and potentially fatal conditions. However, evidence-based guidance on antibiotic therapy remains limited. Current recommendations emphasize the need for broad-spectrum empirical coverage, including gram-positive, gram-negative, anaerobes, and Streptococcus pyogenes when clinically indicated. We aimed at developing a practical, evidence-based framework for empirical antibiotic therapy in NSTIs. This narrative review is informed by a comprehensive literature search of PubMed, without date restrictions. We propose a structured decision-making algorithm for empirical antibiotic selection in NSTIs, integrating key clinical parameters: infection site, healthcare-associated versus community-acquired origin, risk factors for extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Enterobacterales and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and signs of sepsis or septic shock. Alternative regimens are provided for patients with severe β-lactam allergies. Special considerations for immunocompromised and other vulnerable host populations are also addressed. This review offers clinicians a pragmatic, stepwise approach to antibiotic therapy in NSTIs, while identifying critical knowledge gaps and priorities for future research.

Antimicrobial therapy in patients with necrotizing soft tissue infections

17) Early appropriate empiric coverage against suspected pathogens should be initiated, based upon the clinical setting for patients with NSTI (Recommendation 1 C).

18) Patients whose clinical setting or gram stain suggests rapidly progressive infection potentiated by exotoxins from Gram positive pathogens (S. pyogenes, CA-MRSA, Clostridial species), treatment with antimicrobial agents should be combined with antiribosomal agents (clindamycin or linezolid). Patients who present with rapidly progressive infections with gram stains of tissue demonstrating gram negative pathogens (Aeromonas sp. Eikenella, Vibrio sp) should be treated with antiribosomal agents targeting gram negative pathogens (tetracyclines) (Recommendation 1 C).

19) Appropriate empiric coverage against MRSA should be immediately initiated in patients with NSTI (Recommendation 1 C).

20) Since it is impossible to exclude with certainty a polymicrobial necrotizing infection, an aggressive broad-spectrum empiric antimicrobial therapy should initially be selected to cover gram-positive, gram-negative, and anaerobic organisms until culture-specific results and sensitivities are available (Recommendation 1 C).

21) An appropriate de-escalation of antimicrobial therapy is suggested once culture results come back (Recommendation 1 C).

Supportive treatment in patients with necrotizing soft tissue infections

22) Supportive treatment in managing NSTI must be early and aggressive to halt progression of the inflammatory process (Recommendation 1 A).

Intravenous immunoglobulins in patients with necrotizing soft tissue infections

23) Intravenous immunoglobulins may be considered in all patients with NSTI and evidence of organ dysfunction (Recommendation 2 C).

Early nutritional support in patients with necrotizing soft tissue infections

24) Early nutritional support should be established (Recommendation 2 C).

### An atypical presentation of pretibial myxedema in a euthyroid patient with absent antithyroid autoantibodies [^116oA5LH]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Case report

A 77-year-old man was seen for a 3-week history of asymptomatic redness and swelling on the dorsal surface of his feet with gradual extension symmetrically up his lower legs, stopping below the knees. He denied having any associated fevers or chills. He was hospitalized for suspected bilateral cellulitis after 7 days of outpatient treatment with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole failed.

His past medical history was notable for T0N2M0 p16+ squamous cell carcinoma of the cervical lymph nodes, which was treated with nodal excision plus adjuvant cisplatin and radiation therapy in 2004. He remained in remission until February 2015, when extensive local recurrence in the left oropharynx was treated with total laryngectomy, bilateral neck dissection, and right hemithyroidectomy with 2 months of adjuvant cetuximab and radiation. In 2005, postradiation hypothyroidism developed in the patient, requiring thyroid hormone replacement therapy with levothyroxine. Between 2005 and 2020, he was noted to have elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels at least once per year caused by self-reported noncompliance with medication.

The initial physical examination revealed sharply demarcated, bright pink-red, partially blanching, thin plaques with fine scale on the dorsal surfaces of both feet extending symmetrically and circumferentially to just below the knees (Fig 1).

Fig 1
Prebiopsy photograph of the right lower leg demonstrating sharply demarcated, circumferential, bright pink-red, thin plaque with fine scaling of the lower leg. These findings were observed symmetrically on both lower legs.

Peau d'orange-like surface changes were absent. One-plus pitting edema was present to the mid-shins. Periorbital edema, eyelid retraction, exophthalmos, and digital swelling and clubbing were absent. Laboratory findings revealed mild leukopenia (3.3 K/μL) and minimally elevated brain natriuretic peptide (230 pg/mL). Levels of TSH (2.85 mU/L), thyroglobulin antibody (< 1 IU/mL), thyroid peroxidase antibody (< 1 IU/mL), and thyroid-stimulating antibody (< 89% of baseline, reference range ≤ 140% of baseline) were unremarkable.

### Current guidelines and recommendations for the management of skin and soft tissue infections [^117MabCv]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The incidence of severe skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) has significantly increased over the last years. In addition, major ecological changes have been reported with the emergence of community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), involved in a large proportion of these cases. A large number of expert opinions, guidelines, and recommendations for the management of SSTIs have been published over the last decade. The purpose of this review is to compare these guidelines.

Recent Findings

A total of six official publications have presented recommendations for the management of SSTIs. During the same period, other guidelines for the management of MRSA infections have also been published, including some recommendations for SSTIs.

Summary

The applicability of the guidelines is questionable in many ways. The distinction between necrotizing/nonnecrotizing infections is valuable but difficult to apply prior to surgical management. The prescribers should choose a pragmatic approach to empirical antibiotic therapy, taking into account the patient's initial severity, the extent of infection and risk factors for resistant microorganisms essentially related to healthcare-associated circumstances.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^112z7Dvu]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Cellulitis without abscess, ulcer, or purulent drainage — empiric antibiotic selection and MRSA coverage is outlined as follows: treatment with β-lactams, such as cefazolin or oxacillin, was successful in 96% of patients, suggesting MRSA-directed therapy is usually unnecessary; however, MRSA coverage may be prudent with penetrating trauma, illicit drug use, purulent drainage, or concurrent MRSA elsewhere. Options for MRSA include intravenous vancomycin, daptomycin, linezolid, or telavancin, or oral doxycycline, clindamycin, or SMX-TMP; if oral coverage for both streptococci and MRSA is desired, use clindamycin alone or combine SMX-TMP or doxycycline with a β-lactam (eg, penicillin, cephalosporin, or amoxicillin). The activity of doxycycline and SMX-TMP against β-hemolytic streptococci is not known, and in the absence of abscess, ulcer, or purulent drainage, β-lactam monotherapy is recommended; a double-blind study showed SMX-TMP plus cephalexin was no more efficacious than cephalexin alone in pure cellulitis.

Surgical site infections (SSIs) after operations — initial management and when to use antibiotics — are outlined as follows: surveillance standards mandate 30 days of follow-up for operations without placement of prosthetic material and for 1 year for operations where a prosthesis was inserted; the most important therapy for an SSI is to open the incision, evacuate the infected material, and continue dressing changes until the wound heals by secondary intention; if there is < 5 cm of erythema and induration with minimal systemic signs (temperature < 38.5°C, white blood cell (WBC) count < 12 000 cells/μL, and pulse < 100 beats/minute), antibiotics are unnecessary; patients with temperature > 38.5°C or heart rate > 110 beats/minute or erythema extending beyond the wound margins for > 5 cm may require a short course (eg, 24–48 hours) of antibiotics and opening of the suture line; for intestinal or female genital tract operations with mixed flora, antibiotics considered suitable for treatment of intra-abdominal infection are appropriate, and when MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) risk is present the initial antibiotic should include vancomycin, linezolid, daptomycin, telavancin, or ceftaroline plus piperacillin-tazobactam, a carbapenem, or ceftriaxone and metronidazole for gram-negative and anaerobic coverage; for incision and drainage of superficial abscesses, prophylactic antibiotics are not recommended.

Clostridial gas gangrene and myonecrosis — evaluation and treatment recommendations emphasize urgent source control, empiric coverage, targeted therapy, and avoidance of hyperbaric oxygen. Urgent surgical exploration and debridement "should be performed (severe nonpurulent; Figure 1) (strong, moderate)". For empiric therapy when the etiology is not yet defined, "broad-spectrum treatment with vancomycin plus either piperacillin-tazobactam, ampicillin-sulbactam, or a carbapenem antimicrobial is recommended (strong, low)", and "Definitive antimicrobial therapy along with penicillin and clindamycin is recommended for treatment of clostridial myonecrosis (strong, low)". Adjunctive "Hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) therapy is not recommended because it has not been proven as a benefit to the patient and may delay resuscitation and surgical debridement (strong, low)".

Catheter-related bloodstream infection

Question

What is the most effective approach and antibiotic therapy for the management of CRBSI?

Recommendation

Effective management of CRBSI involves timely diagnosis, prompt removal of vascular access if at all possible (source control), and appropriate antibiotic therapy for 7–14 days depending on the causative microorganism, as shown in table 3. Vancomycin plus a beta-lactam (such as piperacillin-tazobactam or a ceftazidime) is usually a good empiric regimen if the risk of ESBL is not high. Reference to the local antibiogram and hospital recommendations is recommended for the selection of empiric therapy.

Table 3
Summary of antibiotic durations for common ICU infections

Discussion

The diagnosis of CRBSI should be distinguished from secondary bacteremia due to other sources. Surveillance cultures for patients with central lines are not recommended when CRBSI is not suspected such as in an asymptomatic patient and should not be done when other cultures are more appropriate to evaluate for the clinically suspected infection (eg, respiratory cultures for a suspected pneumonia).

The choice of antibiotic therapy should be based on local susceptibility patterns and the severity of illness and should be de-escalated when culture data become available. The recommended duration of antibiotic therapy is 7 days for coagulase-negative staphylococci, 7 days for Gram-negative bacilli,14 days for S. aureus (unless a complicated infection is present); and 14 days for Candida (in the absence of retinitis or risk factors for it, as described in the 'Bacteremia' section). Examples of when a S. aureus infection is considered complicated include endocarditis, osteomyelitis, foreign body or implant, metastatic infection, low minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), immunocompromise, and recurrent infection. An infectious disease consultation should be sought in S. aureus CRBSI.

The management described here applies to non-tunneled lines. When a CRBSI is suspected, the central line should be removed. Catheter salvage options when the line cannot reasonably be removed are beyond the scope of this text.

Table 2.
Summary of Recently Approved Antibiotics for the Treatment of Acute Bacterial Skin and Structure Infection

The emergence of community-associated MRSA strains has greatly influenced the selection of empirical antibiotic therapy for ABSSSIs. To provide adequate empirical coverage for MRSA, an understanding of local microbial epidemiologic patterns and susceptibility patterns is essential. For the treatment of an abscess, the IDSA guidelines recommend, in addition to incision and drainage, administration of an antibiotic active against MRSA when the initial antibiotic treatment has failed or when the patient has immunosuppression, systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), or hypotension. For cellulitis and erysipelas, including an antibiotic with activity against MRSA and group A streptococcus is recommended when the infection is associated with penetrating trauma or when there is evidence of MRSA infection, MRSA colonization, injecting drug use, or SIRS. Further, including an antimicrobial agent active against MRSA in the treatment of surgical wound infections is recommended in patients with risk factors for infection by this microorganism (nasal colonization or prior infection, hospitalization, or recent antibiotic administration). Anti-MRSA agents for ABSSSIs include vancomycin, which is considered the first-line parenteral treatment of serious MRSA infections in hospitalized patients, as well as linezolid, daptomycin, and tigecycline (Table 3). Other agents with reliable MRSA activity that have been approved for ABSSSIs include ceftaroline, tedizolid, dalbavancin, oritavancin, and telavancin. Additional factors for administering these medications include tolerability, formulation, cost, and dosing limitations associated with these agents, such as vancomycin-related nephrotoxicity and linezolid-associated myelosuppression.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: testicular cancer, version 2.2025 [^111Ukrxr]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Testicular cancer — clinical presentation is characterized by symptoms in the testis and regionally, and initial antibiotic therapy guidance is specified. Testicular cancer most often presents as a painless or painful testicular nodule, mass, enlargement, or induration (hardening). Often, patients will present with testicular discomfort or swelling suggestive of epididymitis or orchitis. A trial of antibiotics is never warranted in the treatment of a mass suspicious for GCT but can be considered in patients with pain without a mass on further workup. Other patients may present with enlarged lymph nodes of the lower neck or upper chest (supraclavicular), a retroperitoneal mass, gynecomastia, venous thrombosis, or pulmonary embolism.

### Clinical failures of linezolid and implications for the clinical microbiology laboratory [^1171mFbS]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Culture grew S. aureus susceptible to vancomycin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), and gentamicin and resistant to all beta-lactams and clindamycin. Beta-lactams tested included penicillin, nafcillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, cefazolin, and imipenem. Susceptibility testing of this MRSA isolate to linezolid was not performed. All testing was conducted by using a MicroScan (Dade Behring, Inc. West Sacramento, CA) automated system (unless otherwise noted) in accordance with National Committee on for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) testing and quality-control recommendations.

Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid was discontinued, and oral linezolid, 600 mg twice a day, was begun. The patient did well, progressing to full weight-bearing capacity, and finished a 7-week course of linezolid. Two days after completing the course, nausea, fever, and chills developed, and he resumed linezolid. He went to the emergency room on July 30 with a temperature of 103°F; his ankle was warm and tender to palpation. Linezolid was stopped, and intravenous vancomycin, 1 g every 12 hrs, was started. The nail was surgically removed, Gram stain and cultures were obtained, and a peripherally inserted central catheter line was placed intraoperatively. He was continued on vancomycin. Cultures grew MRSA with the same sensitivities as the previous MRSA isolate. Additional susceptibility testing of this isolate to linezolid and TMP-SMX by E-test was performed; both were susceptible (MIC = 4 μg/mL and 0.047 μg/mL, respectively). After 4 weeks, vancomycin was discontinued, and oral TMP-SMX, two double-strength tablets twice daily, was initiated for an additional 8 weeks of therapy. At followup, the patient's laboratory results showed a decreased leukocyte count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and C-reactive protein. He subsequently finished a total of 12 weeks of therapy and remained asymptomatic 6 months after completion of treatment.

### Aztreonam (Azactam) [^111BNH4y]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Concurrent Therapy

Concurrent initial therapy with other antimicrobial agents and AZACTAM is recommended before the causative organism(s) is known in seriously ill patients who are also at risk of having an infection due to Gram-positive aerobic pathogens. If anaerobic organisms are also suspected as etiologic agents, therapy should be initiated using an anti-anaerobic agent concurrently with AZACTAM (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Certain antibiotics (eg, cefoxitin, imipenem) may induce high levels of beta-lactamase in vitro in some Gram-negative aerobes such as Enterobacter and Pseudomonas species, resulting in antagonism to many beta-lactam antibiotics including aztreonam. These in vitro findings suggest that such beta-lactamase-inducing antibiotics not be used concurrently with aztreonam. Following identification and susceptibility testing of the causative organism(s), appropriate antibiotic therapy should be continued.

### Analysis of empiric antimicrobial strategies for cellulitis in the era of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus [^116NBDgH]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2007). Low credibility.

Background

The rise in community-onset methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections potentially complicates the empiric management of cellulitis. The threshold at which drugs active against MRSA, such as clindamycin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX), should be incorporated into empiric therapy is unknown.

Objective

To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of using cephalexin, TMP/SMX, or clindamycin for outpatient empiric therapy of cellulitis, given various likelihoods of infection due to MRSA.

Methods

A decision analysis of the empiric treatment of cellulitis was performed from the perspective of a third-party payer. The model included initial therapy with cephalexin, clindamycin, or TMP/SMX, followed by treatment with linezolid in cases of clinical failure. Probability and cost estimates were obtained from clinical trials, epidemiologic data, and publicly available cost data and were subjected to sensitivity analysis.

Results

Under the base-case scenario (37% probability of infection by S. aureus and a 27% MRSA prevalence), cephalexin was the most cost-effective option. Clindamycin became a more cost-effective therapy at MRSA probabilities from 41–80% when the probability of staphylococcal infection was greater than 40%. TMP/SMX was cost-effective only at very high likelihoods of MRSA infection. Variables with the most influence in the model were probability of S. aureus being methicillin-resistant, cost of linezolid, probability of a cure with cephalexin for a non-MRSA infection, and probability of infection due to S. aureus.

Conclusions

Cephalexin remains a cost-effective therapy for outpatient management of cellulitis at current estimated MRSA levels. Cephalexin was the most cost-effective choice over most of the modeled range of probabilities, with clindamycin becoming more cost-effective at high likelihoods of MRSA infection. TMP/SMX is unlikely to be cost-effective for treatment of simple cellulitis. Further studies of the microbiology of cellulitis, the epidemiology of MRSA, and the clinical effectiveness of clindamycin and TMP/SMX in skin and soft tissue infections are needed.
