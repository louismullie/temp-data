## Question

How to treat recurrent fever syndrome?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to diagnose and treat recurrent fever syndromes. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining the clinical syndrome and distinguishing it from mimics. Then, I should verify the differential diagnosis, especially autoinflammatory diseases versus infection, malignancy, and autoimmune etiologies. Next, I will consider a staged diagnostic workup with genetic testing and phenotypic tools. After that, I should align treatment strategies by phenotype, including FMF, PFAPA, SURF, TRAPS, MKD/HIDS, and CAPS. Finally, I will review special situations, monitoring for complications, and follow-up adjustments over time, making sure I cite high-quality evidence where available.

> Let me first confirm the clinical syndrome definition. Recurrent fever syndromes present with stereotyped febrile episodes, often accompanied by elevated acute phase reactants, in the absence of persistent infection or autoimmunity; this pattern points toward autoinflammation rather than autoimmunity, with key entities including FMF, PFAPA, SURF, TRAPS, MKD/HIDS, and CAPS, which share dysregulated innate immunity and risk of complications such as amyloidosis if uncontrolled [^115x7Zgc] [^112dvJCV] [^11172hxq].

> Wait, let me verify the broad differential before anchoring on autoinflammation. In children, most recurrent fevers are due to sequential viral infections. True periodic fever syndromes are rare and should be considered when episodes are stereotyped and self-limited with return to baseline, while prolonged daily fever warrants a different workup for fever of unknown origin, and infections, malignancy, and autoimmune diseases must be excluded early with targeted testing guided by associated features [^112YUxC3] [^115kjydu] [^112DjDK3].

> I will now examine the diagnostic approach in stages. First, confirm objective fever with logs, characterize periodicity, and document inter-episode wellness. Persistent symptoms or chronic inflammation between flares argue against PFAPA and support entities like FMF, TRAPS, MKD, or CAPS, prompting earlier genetic testing and specialist referral, whereas a well child with clockwork 2–8 week intervals and oropharyngeal features favors PFAPA and watchful waiting with a trial of steroids during attacks may suffice [^11615346] [^115iW1aM] [^112mR5RB].

> Next, I should review first-line labs and when to escalate. Baseline evaluation includes CBC, ESR/CRP, urinalysis, and targeted infection screens; between attacks, persistently elevated SAA or ESR/CRP supports subclinical inflammation and should push toward monogenic autoinflammatory testing and treatment even if attacks are infrequent, because the long-term risk of amyloidosis is real in FMF, TRAPS, and CAPS [^113M3Rmu] [^11172hxq].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of genetics and phenotypic tools. Genetic testing panels covering recurrent fever genes are indicated when features suggest a hereditary autoinflammatory syndrome, recognizing that classification criteria combining genetic and clinical variables outperform clinical-only criteria; in parallel, for PFAPA, modified Marshall criteria with regularity and oropharyngeal features are commonly used, while SURF remains a diagnosis of exclusion after ruling out monogenic causes and PFAPA [^1121UPa1] [^11615346] [^113dN6zX].

> Let me consider the key syndromes and their clinical signatures. PFAPA typically presents before age 5 with 3–7 day fevers every 2–8 weeks plus pharyngitis, cervical adenitis, and/or aphthae, with normal growth and well-being between attacks. FMF features shorter 1–3 day attacks of fever with serositis or erysipelas-like rash and risk of renal amyloidosis. TRAPS has prolonged 1–3 week fevers with migratory myalgia, rash, periorbital edema, and conjunctivitis. MKD/HIDS presents in infancy with 3–7 day fevers, abdominal pain, lymphadenopathy, and elevated IgD. CAPS spans a spectrum from FCAS to NOMID with cold-triggered flares, urticarial rash, and neurologic or bone involvement [^11615346] [^11172hxq] [^115EoAN7] [^115b1D6S].

> I need to ensure I distinguish SURF carefully. SURF describes patients with recurrent autoinflammation lacking a monogenic diagnosis and not meeting PFAPA criteria; clinically, they often have arthralgia, abdominal pain, and myalgia, and PFAPA-like features can coexist, creating diagnostic overlap; colchicine is frequently tried and can be effective in a meaningful proportion, though responses vary and predictors of resistance are being defined [^11394eYy] [^113dN6zX] [^1126171L].

> Now, for FMF, I should confirm first-line therapy and when to escalate. Colchicine remains the cornerstone to reduce attack frequency and prevent amyloidosis; approximately 5–10% are resistant or intolerant, in whom anti–IL-1 agents such as anakinra or canakinumab are effective alternatives with strong meta-analytic support, and dose-interval extension of canakinumab may be feasible in sustained responders to reduce treatment burden [^113M3Rmu] [^111A8JTG] [^1179ncBm].

> For PFAPA, let me reconsider the sequence of therapies. A single dose of prednisone or prednisolone at 1–2 mg/kg (max 60 mg) at fever onset reliably aborts attacks, though shortened intervals between attacks can occur. For frequent episodes, prophylaxis with colchicine or cimetidine can be considered, and tonsillectomy reduces attack frequency in randomized trials but should be weighed against surgical risks and the self-limited course, with the best evidence supporting adenotonsillectomy rather than tonsillectomy alone [^115hVh8r] [^11615346] [^112eFy4h].

> For SURF, I should double-check treatment patterns and response predictors. Colchicine is a reasonable first-line trial with approximately 60% response in cohorts, and PFAPA-like features, especially aphthous stomatitis, predict colchicine resistance. In refractory cases, IL-1 blockade with anakinra or canakinumab has demonstrated benefit, though comparative effectiveness is limited and treatment should be individualized based on severity and inflammatory burden [^11394eYy] [^114czkEB] [^1126171L].

> For TRAPS, let me verify the preferred biologic class. Although TNF inhibitors such as etanercept have been used, IL-1 blockade with anakinra or canakinumab achieves superior control in both randomized and observational data, with canakinumab showing durable responses and improvements in quality of life in the CLUSTER program [^114FMcoC] [^115jRkod] [^116fM7S6].

> For MKD/HIDS, I should confirm the limited options. Colchicine is generally ineffective; NSAIDs and corticosteroids provide symptomatic relief, simvastatin has small RCT signals but inconsistent real-world benefit, and IL-1 blockade with anakinra or canakinumab is the most reliable strategy for attack control in refractory disease, albeit with limited high-quality evidence [^115jRkod] [^115EoAN7].

> For CAPS, I need to ensure early IL-1 blockade. Given the IL-1–driven pathophysiology, anakinra, canakinumab, or rilonacept are first-line and can prevent organ damage. Treat-to-target strategies emphasize rapid control of inflammation and normalization of acute phase reactants, with sustained HRQoL gains documented in trials and real-world cohorts [^114SMpJp] [^116fM7S6] [^113QqW2m].

> But wait, what about special situations and perioperative care. Patients with periodic fever syndromes may require perioperative planning to avoid flares, and in suspected or confirmed autoinflammation with life-threatening complications such as macrophage activation syndrome, high-dose anakinra is a key intervention; in adults with recurrent fevers, adult-onset PFAPA and other autoinflammatory entities should be considered, and the same principles of excluding infection and malignancy apply before labeling as autoinflammatory [^116m8o2i] [^1179mm1W] [^113jicbV].

> I should confirm monitoring and long-term follow-up priorities. For FMF and other amyloidosis-prone autoinflammatory diseases, periodic urinalysis for proteinuria and SAA measurement between attacks are essential; treat-to-target frameworks in FMF incorporate clinical, biomarker, and patient-reported outcomes, and dose adjustments of colchicine or biologics should be guided by disease control and tolerability rather than a fixed duration [^113M3Rmu] [^111xfaZz].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about prognosis and stopping rules. PFAPA often remits spontaneously, so continuation of prophylaxis should be reassessed periodically. In contrast, FMF and TRAPS generally require lifelong therapy, though selected FMF patients on IL-1 blockade may eventually attempt taper or transition back to colchicine if sustained remission is achieved, underscoring the need for individualized decisions and shared decision-making with families [^111AAcd8] [^111ey4FJ].

> Finally, I need to ensure the diagnostic and therapeutic algorithm remains dynamic. Emerging data on SURF endotypes, cytokine signatures, and refined classification criteria may soon enable earlier biologic use in high-inflammatory subgroups, while genetic testing access and payer policies continue to shape real-world treatment pathways. Until then, a stepwise approach anchored in clinical phenotype, objective inflammation, and response to targeted therapies remains the most reliable strategy [^1162zLLd] [^112dvJCV] [^111xfaZz].

Recurrent fever syndrome is best managed with a **stepwise approach** that starts with colchicine for suspected FMF and escalates to IL-1 blockade (anakinra or canakinumab) for colchicine-resistant or genetically confirmed TRAPS/MKD/CAPS, guided by genetic testing and clinical response [^113QqW2m] [^114FMcoC] [^111A8JTG]. For PFAPA, single-dose corticosteroids abort attacks, colchicine or cimetidine reduce frequency, and tonsillectomy is reserved for refractory cases [^11615346] [^112eFy4h]. SURF is treated with colchicine first-line, with IL-1 inhibitors for non-responders [^11394eYy] [^1126171L]. Monitor for amyloidosis with urinalysis and SAA, and tailor therapy to response and tolerance [^111xfaZz].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

A thorough diagnostic evaluation is essential to **identify the underlying cause** and guide therapy:

- **Clinical history**: Detailed characterization of fever episodes, associated symptoms, family history, and ethnic background [^112YUxC3].

- **Laboratory tests**: CBC, ESR, CRP, SAA, urinalysis, and targeted genetic testing (MEFV, TNFRSF1A, MVK, NLRP3) [^111Wq3KY].

- **Imaging**: Chest X-ray, abdominal ultrasound, or MRI as indicated to assess organ involvement [^notfound].

---

## General treatment principles

Treatment strategies are **tailored to the specific diagnosis**, severity, and patient-specific factors:

- **Colchicine**: First-line for FMF and some SURF cases; effective in reducing attack frequency and preventing amyloidosis [^112C4qCP] [^11394eYy].

- **IL-1 blockade**: Anakinra or canakinumab for colchicine-resistant FMF, TRAPS, MKD, and CAPS [^114FMcoC] [^111A8JTG].

- **Corticosteroids**: Short courses for acute attacks in TRAPS, MKD, and PFAPA [^115jRkod] [^11615346].

- **TNF inhibitors**: Etanercept for TRAPS when IL-1 blockade is contraindicated or ineffective [^115jRkod].

---

## Specific treatment protocols by syndrome

| **Syndrome** | **First-line treatment** | **Second-line treatment** | **Additional options** |
|-|-|-|-|
| FMF | Colchicine | IL-1 blockade (anakinra, canakinumab) | Corticosteroids for acute attacks |
| TRAPS | IL-1 blockade (anakinra, canakinumab) | Etanercept | Corticosteroids for acute attacks |
| MKD/HIDS | IL-1 blockade (anakinra, canakinumab) | Simvastatin (limited evidence) | Corticosteroids, NSAIDs |
| CAPS | IL-1 blockade (anakinra, canakinumab, rilonacept) | None | Corticosteroids for severe flares |
| PFAPA | Corticosteroids (single dose) | Colchicine, cimetidine | Tonsillectomy |
| SURF | Colchicine | IL-1 blockade (anakinra, canakinumab) | Corticosteroids |

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular monitoring is essential to assess **treatment efficacy**, detect complications, and adjust therapy:

- **Clinical assessment**: Regular evaluation of fever frequency, severity, and associated symptoms [^112YUxC3].

- **Laboratory monitoring**: Periodic assessment of inflammatory markers (CRP, ESR, SAA) and urinalysis for amyloidosis [^111xfaZz].

- **Imaging**: Annual abdominal ultrasound or echocardiography if amyloidosis is suspected [^notfound].

---

## Patient education and support

Patient education and support are critical for **adherence and optimal outcomes**. Provide clear information on the disease, treatment options, and potential side effects, and connect patients with support groups and counseling resources to address psychosocial impacts [^notfound].

---

## Emerging therapies and future directions

Emerging therapies include **JAK inhibitors** under investigation for certain autoinflammatory syndromes and gene therapy approaches targeting specific genetic mutations. Personalized medicine strategies aim to tailor therapy based on genetic profiling and biomarkers [^1159tGHe].

---

Effective management of recurrent fever syndrome requires a **multidisciplinary approach**, individualized treatment plans, and regular monitoring to prevent complications and improve quality of life.

Overall colchicine efficacy

Data about overall colchicine efficacy were available for 77 patients. Regarding the other seven patients: in five patients, data on treatment efficacy were missing; in one patient, evaluation was not possible due to family decision to discontinue treatment; and in one case, therapy was discontinued due to drug intolerance. The median duration of treatment was 2.48 years (IQR 1.00; 4.13). The overall response was stratified into complete, partial and absent (ineffective) (table 2, figure 2A). At the last follow-up, a complete response was observed in 47 patients (61%), a partial response in 24 subjects (31%) and an absent response in 6 patients (8%) (figure 2A).

### Unexplained recurrent fever: when is autoinflammation the explanation? [^115cW19G]. Allergy (2013). Low credibility.

Recurrent fever can be the sole or leading manifestation of a variety of diseases including malignancies, autoimmune diseases and infections. Because the differential diagnoses are manifold, no formal guidelines for the approach of patients with recurrent fever exists. The newly recognized group of autoinflammatory diseases are often accompanied by repetitive fever attacks. As these episodes are frequently associated by a variety of divergent presentations, the differentiation of other causes for febrile illnesses can be difficult. In this article, we first review disease entities, which frequently present with the symptom of recurrent fever. In a next step, we summarize their characteristic pattern of disease presentation. Finally, we analyse key features of autoinflammatory diseases, which are helpful to distinguish this group of diseases from the other causes of recurrent fever. Recognizing these symptom patterns can provide the crucial clues and, thus, lead to the initiation of targeted specific diagnostic tests and therapies.

### Canakinumab improves patient-reported outcomes in children and adults with autoinflammatory recurrent fever syndromes: results from the CLUSTER trial [^116fM7S6]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate the effect of canakinumab on health-related quality of life (HRQoL), work/school and social life of patients with autoinflammatory recurrent fever syndromes, including colchicine-resistant familial Mediterranean fever, mevalonate kinase deficiency, and tumour necrosis factor receptor-associated periodic syndrome, in the CLUSTER trial.

Methods

HRQoL of patients who received canakinumab 150 mg or 300 mg every four weeks in the CLUSTER trial (n = 173) was assessed at baseline and Weeks 17 and 41. For children we used the Child Health Questionnaire - Parent Form 50 (CHQ-PF50), including psychosocial (PsS) and physical (PhS) component summary scores. For adults, the Short-Form-12 (SF-12) Health Survey was used, including physical (PFS) and mental (PCS) component summary scores. The Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) was used to determine the impact of treatment on work/school, social and family life.

Results

The results obtained were remarkably consistent in both paediatric and adult patients across the three disease cohorts. At baseline, median scores for physical components were relatively low (26–29 for PhS and 34–38 for PFS); they improved to values similar to those expected in the general population by Week 17, and this improvement was sustained at Week 41, when median PhS scores were 47–50 and PFS 44–54. Psychosocial and mental scores also improved from baseline to Week 17 and 41, with scores comparable to the general population. Notable improvements were also observed in the SDS scale.

Conclusions

Patients with three inherited autoinflammatory syndromes experienced sustained improvements on their HRQoL, work/school, and social life on treatment with canakinumab.

### Adult-onset recurrent Kawasaki disease: an unusual cause of fever of unknown origin [^1131FmBn]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

We present the case of a 20-year-old man with a background of transposition of the great arteries presenting with fever of unknown origin, who developed a shock like syndrome with respiratory failure necessitating intubation. After extensive investigation, a diagnosis of adult-onset Kawasaki disease was made, and he was successfully treated with IVIg and corticosteroids. We present the clinical findings clinicians should be aware of, and review the literature on managing this rare presentation in adult, highlighting the importance of early diagnosis in improving outcomes. Both children and adults with Kawasaki disease require long-term follow-up, as they remain at increased risk of both coronary artery aneurysms and early acute coronary syndrome.

### Predictive factors for therapeutic response and cluster analysis in syndrome of undifferentiated recurrent fever (SURF) [^1126171L]. RMD Open (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Syndrome of undifferentiated recurrent fever (SURF) refers to a group of recurrent fevers without a clear monogenic cause. Clinical spectrum, treatment response predictors and management strategies remain unclear.

Objective

This study aims to longitudinally analyse a homogeneously selected cohort of 101 SURF patients, to identify factors associated with colchicine resistance and to evaluate the efficacy of interleukin-1 (IL-1) inhibitors.

Methods

Patients were enrolled in the Eurofever Registry, carefully excluding those with periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis and cervical adenitis (PFAPA); familial Mediterranean fever and other known monogenic recurrent fevers. Demographic, clinical and treatment data were analysed to identify predictors of colchicine resistance and define subgroups through cluster analysis.

Results

Common symptoms included fever, arthralgia, abdominal pain and myalgia, with PFAPA-like features (lymphadenopathy, tonsillitis, oral aphthae) observed in one-third of cases, sporadically. Colchicine efficacy, assessed in 77 patients, revealed complete response in the majority of patients (61%). Univariable analysis identified PFAPA-like features, including aphthous stomatitis (p = 0.001), cervical lymphadenopathy (p = 0.012) and exudative tonsillitis (p = 0.004), as associated with colchicine resistance. Multivariable analysis confirmed aphthous stomatitis as an independent predictor of resistance (p = 0.014). Tonsillectomy was ineffective. IL-1 inhibitors (anakinra, canakinumab) were beneficial in refractory cases. Cluster analysis revealed three distinct subgroups with varying symptoms and colchicine responses.

Conclusions

These findings provide new insights into SURF, identifying predictors of colchicine resistance and supporting the efficacy of IL-1 blockade. Cluster analysis suggests the heterogeneity within SURF, reinforcing the need for refined diagnostic criteria and personalised treatment strategies.

### Diagnosis of PFAPA syndrome applied to a cohort of 17 adults with unexplained recurrent fevers [^113jicbV]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The pathophysiology of PFAPA syndrome, mainly characterised by regularly recurring periodic fevers associated with aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis and/or lymphadenitis, and mostly occurring in the paediatric setting, resembles an acquired autoinflammatory disease. The description of PFAPA syndrome in adult patients is largely increasing.

Objectives

To recognise PFAPA syndrome in a group of adult patients evaluated for recurrent fevers in our Rheumatology Unit.

Methods

To apply current diagnostic criteria for PFAPA syndrome in a group of 359 adults with unexplained recurrent fevers monitored in our Unit between January 2007 and June 2011.

Results

We have found 17 out of 359 patients fulfilling the diagnosis of PFAPA syndrome: these patients (10 males, 7 females) were Caucasian with a mean age of 33.3 ± 9.5 years, had recurrent febrile episodes begun at a mean age of 25.9 ± 8.3 years and a mean number of episodes of 8.3 ± 5.2 per year with a mean duration of 5.5 ± 1.8 days. In particular, 7/17 patients had the 3 cardinal signs, the other 10 had a combination of 2 signs. Corticosteroids were given in 14/17 patients; tonsillectomy was performed in 9/17 patients: corticosteroid responsiveness and tonsillectomy efficacy were observed respectively in 11 and 2 patients.

Conclusions

Our case highlights the importance of considering PFAPA syndrome in adults presenting with unexplained recurrent fevers and symptoms commonly encountered in general medical practice.

### Canakinumab for the treatment of autoinflammatory recurrent fever syndromes [^114FMcoC]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2018). Excellent credibility.

Background

Familial Mediterranean fever, mevalonate kinase deficiency (also known as the hyperimmunoglobulinemia D syndrome), and the tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS) are monogenic autoinflammatory diseases characterized by recurrent fever flares.

Methods

We randomly assigned patients with genetically confirmed colchicine-resistant familial Mediterranean fever, mevalonate kinase deficiency, or TRAPS at the time of a flare to receive 150 mg of canakinumab subcutaneously or placebo every 4 weeks. Patients who did not have a resolution of their flare received an add-on injection of 150 mg of canakinumab. The primary outcome was complete response (resolution of flare and no flare until week 16). In the subsequent phase up to week 40, patients who had a complete response underwent a second randomization to receive canakinumab or placebo every 8 weeks. Patients who underwent a second randomization and had a subsequent flare and all other patients received open-label canakinumab.

Results

At week 16, significantly more patients receiving canakinumab had a complete response than those receiving placebo: 61% vs. 6% of patients with colchicine-resistant familial Mediterranean fever (P < 0.001), 35% versus 6% of those with mevalonate kinase deficiency (P = 0.003), and 45% versus 8% of those with TRAPS (P = 0.006). The inclusion of patients whose dose was increased to 300 mg every 4 weeks yielded a complete response in 71% of those with colchicine-resistant familial Mediterranean fever, 57% of those with mevalonate kinase deficiency, and 73% of those with TRAPS. After week 16, an extended dosing regimen (every 8 weeks) maintained disease control in 46% of patients with colchicine-resistant familial Mediterranean fever, 23% of those with mevalonate kinase deficiency, and 53% of those with TRAPS. Among patients who received canakinumab, the most frequently reported adverse events were infections (173.3, 313.5, and 148.0 per 100 patient-years among patients with colchicine-resistant familial Mediterranean fever, those with mevalonate kinase deficiency, and those with TRAPS, respectively), with a few being serious infections (6.6, 13.7, and 0.0 per 100 patient-years).

Conclusions

In this trial, canakinumab was effective in controlling and preventing flares in patients with colchicine-resistant familial Mediterranean fever, mevalonate kinase deficiency, and TRAPS. (Funded by Novartis; CLUSTER ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02059291 .).

Introduction: While periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, and adenitis (PFAPA) syndrome is traditionally considered a benign and self-limited syndrome, treatment strategies such as corticosteroids and tonsillectomy are often used to accelerate fever resolution. In contrast, patients with syndrome of undifferentiated recurrent fever (SURF) remain understudied, and treatment approaches are largely extrapolated from PFAPA management.

Objectives: To evaluate fever resolution rates and the impact of tonsillectomy in PFAPA and SURF, and to explore how clinical phenotype influences treatment outcomes using principal component analysis (PCA).

Methods: Fever resolution was defined as ≥ 12 months without febrile episodes since the recent follow up with reported absence of febrile episodes. Time-to-resolution was assessed using Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression models. Separate subgroup analysis examined the effect of tonsillectomy by diagnosis. PCA was used to identify clinical phenotypes associated with resolution trends.

### Perioperative care of the patient with a periodic fever syndrome [^116m8o2i]. Journal of Clinical Anesthesia (2024). Medium credibility.

Periodic fever syndromes are autoinflammatory disorders associated with recurrent fevers unrelated to infection. Little is known about the perioperative management of patients with these syndromes, and existing literature consists primarily of case reports and occasional case series. This narrative review discusses background information and diagnostic criteria for the three most common periodic fever syndromes: periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, adenitis (PFAPA), familial Mediterranean fever (FMF), and TNF receptor-associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS), and describes perioperative considerations for anesthesia providers when caring for the patient with a periodic fever syndrome. We include a systems-based framework in which to organize these considerations.

### Pericarditis and autoinflammation: a clinical and genetic analysis of patients with idiopathic recurrent pericarditis and monogenic autoinflammatory diseases at a national referral center [^115CP3Hv]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Idiopathic recurrent pericarditis (IRP) is a poorly understood sequela of acute pericarditis that impacts significantly on quality of life. IRP management remains challenging, with no US guidelines currently in place to aid clinicians and, although studies have demonstrated that corticosteroids are associated with increased recurrence risk, their use in IRP remains widespread. Consequently, there is a need to understand the mechanisms driving IRP, to guide management that minimizes treatment‐associated harm.

A leading hypothesis is that IRP is mediated by autoinflammation. Autoinflammation is defined as excessive activity of the innate immune system, in the absence of an extrinsic stressor or autoreactive antibodies or T cells. It is best understood in the context of the monogenic systemic autoinflammatory disease (SAID). The prototypic SAID is familial Mediterranean fever (FMF), an autosomal recessive disease caused by mutations in the MEFV gene that result in overactivity of the pyrin inflammasome and interleukin (IL)‐1β secretion, which presents with episodic serositis.

FMF prognosis has been transformed by prophylactic use of colchicine, an ancient drug that acts on the cytoskeleton, with pleiotropic effects including inhibition of inflammasome formation. More recently, biologic anti‐IL‐1 agents, including anakinra and rilonacept, have revolutionized the management of colchicine‐refractory FMF and 3 other monogenic SAIDs: cryopyrin‐associated periodic syndrome (CAPS), TNF receptor–associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS), and mevalonate kinase deficiency (MKD). These developments have highlighted the central role of IL‐1 in autoinflammation and provided a paradigm for the targeted treatment of relapsing inflammatory diseases. Importantly, randomized controlled trials have shown that these same agents are effective in IRP (Table 1). This was reflected both in the inclusion of colchicine and anakinra in the 2015 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines and the recent US Food and Drug Administration licensing of rilonacept and, interestingly, suggests that IRP may be mediated by autoinflammatory pathways.

### Clinical, immunologic, and genetic characteristics in patients with syndrome of undifferentiated recurrent fevers [^112dvJCV]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Syndrome of undifferentiated recurrent fevers (SURF) is characterized by recurrent fevers and autoinflammation without a confirmed molecular diagnosis of a hereditary recurrent fever syndrome, and not fulfilling criteria for periodic fever, adenitis, pharyngitis, aphthous stomatitis syndrome (PFAPA). The goal of this study was to characterize clinical features of patients with SURF compared to patients with PFAPA and to analyze their cytokine signature, genetic variations, and responses to treatment.

Methods

We enrolled 46 patients observed at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center. Baseline data and inflammatory cytokines were collected at enrollment, and their clinical course was followed. Cytokine analysis was performed using a cytokine multiplex assay. Many patients had specific or whole exome genetic testing.

Results

The prevalence of rash and arthralgias were higher in patients with SURF compared to patients with PFAPA. Pharyngitis and adenopathy were less frequent. A subset of patients with SURF clustered together with elevated proinflammatory cytokines and more frequently required biologic therapy. Focused analysis of whole exome sequencing data revealed that variants of unknown clinical significance (VUCS) were frequently identified in genes implicated in B cell development, immunodeficiencies, and inflammatory bowel disease risk. Treatments for patients with SURF commonly included on-demand steroids, colchicine, and anti-interleukin-1 therapy.

Conclusion

Our findings suggest SURF is a heterogeneous group but has distinct clinical and immunologic features from disorders such as PFAPA. Patients have frequent VUCS, which may have relevance to disease pathogenesis. A subset of patients showed more inflammation and an increased need for biologic therapy. Further research is necessary to define whether there exist distinct SURF endotypes and to better predict treatment outcomes.

### Schnitzler's syndrome: diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up [^1162HZM9]. Allergy (2013). Low credibility.

Schnitzler's syndrome is characterized by recurrent urticarial rash and monoclonal gammopathy, associated with clinical and biological signs of inflammation and a long-term risk of AA amyloidosis and overt lymphoproliferation. An extensive literature review was performed, and the following questions were addressed during an expert meeting: In whom should Schnitzler's syndrome be suspected? How should the diagnosis of Schnitzler's syndrome be established? How should a patient with Schnitzler's syndrome be treated? How should a patient with Schnitzler's syndrome be followed up?. A diagnosis of Schnitzler's syndrome is considered definite in any patient with two obligate criteria: a recurrent urticarial rash and a monoclonal IgM gammopathy, and two of the following minor criteria: recurrent fever, objective signs of abnormal bone remodeling, elevated CRP level or leukocytosis, and a neutrophilic infiltrate on skin biopsy. It is considered probable, if only 1 minor criterion is present. In patients with monoclonal IgG gammopathies, diagnosis is definite if three minor criteria are present and possible if two are present. First-line treatment in patients with significant alteration of quality of life or persistent elevation of markers of inflammation should be anakinra. Follow-up should include clinical evaluation, CBC and CRP every 3 months and MGUS as usually recommended.

### Colchicine versus cimetidine: the better choice for periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, adenitis (PFAPA) syndrome prophylaxis, and the role of MEFV gene mutations [^117Vwetk]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Although PFAPA syndrome is a benign autoinflammatory disorder, Serious complications such as amyloidosis in PFAPA syndrome are very rare. Since this condition can affect the patient's quality of life and have a profound impact on family economy, decision about choosing the better option to prevent of febrile episodes is one of the therapeutic challenges. Recommended treatments for prophylaxis of febrile attacks are based on retrospective studies and the international consensus of physicians. There are few randomized controlled trials of the prophylactic treatment in PFAPA syndrome. This study was a randomized clinical trial to evaluate and compare the effect of colchicine and cimetidine in preventing febrile episodes.

In the present study, the male/female ratio was about 2/1, and the age of disease onset was within 6 months to 4.5 years, which is nearly consistent with the results of previous studies in Turkey and Slovenia. In most previous studies a male significant predominance in the incidence of PFAPA syndrome has been reported. There was no significant difference in demographic characteristics between the colchicine and cimetidine groups, as shown in Table 2. There was a positive family history of recurrent fever in first-degree relatives in 7 (10%) patients. Moreover, 13 (19%) patients had parents with consanguineous marriages. A family history of recurrent fever was reported within 10–44% in other studies. This finding could suggest the genetic background of PFAPA syndrome. Further investigations of genetic causes in PFAPA syndrome help diagnose the etiology of this disease.

Although the antipyretic arm was originally considered a control arm, antipyretics may be effective therapy for some children and are a reasonable option, especially for parents who are reluctant to use daily medication, are concerned about steroid side effects, or are concerned about the risks of tonsillectomy. This strategy was used prior to the discovery of effective abortive/prophylactic treatments, and no sequelae were reported in these patients.

The abortive arm was included to examine the efficacy of corticosteroids in halting the episode at onset. The corticosteroid regimen starts with the suggested dose of 1 mg/kg (max 60 mg), or 2 mg/kg (max 60 mg) in cases of inadequate response or shortened interval (≤ 14 days) between episodes. The dose was determined by the survey data which showed 64% of physicians used 1 mg/kg of prednisone (or prednisolone) and 29% used 2 mg/kg. Given both the adverse effects of corticosteroids and the survey showing preference for the 1 mg/kg dose, we chose to start with the lower dose, which can be increased to 2 mg/kg (max 60 mg) as a single dose if the response to 1 mg/kg was incomplete. We allowed intervals of ≥ 21 days for response to corticosteroids and recommended changing to another arm in the case of frequent flares (≤ 14 days). In the case of intervals between 14 and 21 days, it was recommended that the steroid dose be increased from 1 mg/kg to 2 mg/kg. If the interval increased to ≥ 21 days, then steroids would be continued at this higher dose. If they did not, then a different treatment arm is recommended.

### Is it possible to extend the dose interval of canakinumab treatment in children with familial mediterranean fever? PeRA group experience [^111ey4FJ]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this study, patients with familial Mediterranean fever who were treated with canakinumab and whose dose intervals were adjusted according to a standard protocol were evaluated. The study focused only on patients who followed the protocol, demonstrating that it is possible to successfully integrate this protocol with canakinumab therapy. Our study represents the largest number of patient evaluation of canakinumab dose interval extension using a standardized protocol. It is worth noting that the protocol used in this study was developed using the Delphi method, a consensus-building approach that involved pediatric rheumatologists from multiple centers, and this protocol has been implemented in their clinical practice.

The use of anti-interleukin-1 therapies in patients with colchicine-resistant FMF is a relatively new concept that has gained significant attention in recent years. Currently, guidelines recommend the use of anti-IL-1 therapy for patients who do not respond adequately to colchicine. Randomized controlled studies have demonstrated the efficacy of canakinumab in managing and preventing flares of familial Mediterranean fever in children. Overall, the treatment is considered safe, with the most frequently reported side effects being mild infections, abdominal pain, headaches, and injection-site reactions. Serious side effects, on the other hand, have been rarely observed. However, data on anti-IL-1 treatment duration are limited to case series, and there are no clear recommendations regarding treatment duration. Interestingly, in clinical practice, it has been observed that attacks do not recur after discontinuation of anti-IL-1 therapy in some patients. This phenomenon may be explained by the termination of the 'autonomous' state in patients with IL-1 blockade. An autonomous state within inflammatory diseases is related to a constitutively active and self-amplifying innate immune response, which is most prominently observed in individuals with cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome (CAPS). Nonetheless, in some individuals with FMF, it is suggested that unexpectedly prolonged episodes or frequent recurrent attacks may be attributed to a vicious circle of pro-inflammatory cytokine production triggered by a stressful condition. The administration of biologic agents targeting IL-1 may interrupt this autonomous IL-1β production in some colchicine-refractory FMF patients, leading to a more stable disease course and a restored positive response to colchicine treatment. Nonetheless, there are still only a limited number of studies on the cessation of canakinumab treatment in FMF patients.

### Is it possible to extend the dose interval of canakinumab treatment in children with familial mediterranean fever? PeRA group experience [^1179ncBm]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is the most common hereditary autoinflammatory syndrome and primarily affects individuals from the Mediterranean basin. The condition manifests as recurrent inflammatory episodes typically marked by fever and serositis. The MEFV gene, which is responsible for encoding the pyrin protein, is often mutated in patients with FMF. MEFV mutations are known to affect pyrin-mediated regulation of caspase 1 activity in inflammasomes, which can lead to excess production of interleukin-1 (IL-1), a pro-inflammatory cytokine.

Colchicine is the recommended treatment and has proven effective in preventing inflammatory attacks as well as the development of amyloidosis, the most important complication associated with this condition. However, approximately 5–10% of patients have inadequate response to colchicine. While it is known that colchicine can inhibit IL-1β release from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of FMF patients, the specific efficacy of colchicine in the treatment of FMF and the impact of disease-specific MEFV variants on the RhoA-induced pyrin inflammasome and NLRP3 inflammasomes are still unclear. Nevertheless, blocking IL-1β activity has emerged as a target for patients with inadequate response to colchicine, and positive outcomes has been reported. However, there is no clear data on the optimal duration of treatment with anti-interleukin-1 drugs, as well as the dose interval. In a Delphi study on the management of FMF patients conducted by our working group 'PeRA' in 2020, a consensus was reached on the opening the dose interval of anti-IL-1 therapies. This study suggests that patients who have been free of attacks and subclinical inflammation for the last 6 months after starting biologics can have their treatment intervals extended to twice the original dose intervals. Moreover, for those who remain free of attacks and subclinical inflammation for one year after the extension, treatment intervals can be extended to three times the original dose intervals. The protocol was adopted by centers that reached this consensus in advance and applied to patients receiving canakinumab.

The objective of this study was to assess patients whose canakinumab dose interval was adjusted based on the aforementioned protocol.

Introduction: SURF represents a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by self-limited recurrent fevers and systemic autoinflammation without confirmed molecular diagnosis of a Hereditary Recurrent Fever syndrome, and not fulfilling criteria for Periodic Fever, Adenitis, Pharyngitis, Aphthous stomatitis syndrome (PFAPA), and is a cause of significant burden to affected families due to days of daycare or school missed for the child, and days of work missed for the parent. Very little is currently known about SURF, and many different phenotypes are likely encompassed by this term.

Objectives: Our primary objectives are to define the clinical manifestations, treatment responses, cytokine signatures, and genetic variants of SURF. Our secondary objective is to compare clinical manifestations and cytokine signatures of SURF patients to PFAPA.

### Monoclonal gammopathy, arthralgias, and recurrent fever syndrome: a new autoinflammatory syndrome? [^113BXLNP]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

To describe a new autoinflammatory syndrome with recurrent fever and monoclonal gammopathy that differs from Schnitzler syndrome.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective study of patients with monoclonal gammopathy and recurrent fever of unknown origin.

Results

Five patients were studied; median age at onset of symptoms was 44 years. Median frequency of fever attacks was 6 episodes per year. In the absence of treatment, the median duration of fevers was 3 days.

Conclusion

This new autoinflammatory syndrome is defined by an association among monoclonal gammopathy, arthralgias, and recurrent fever.

### Proceedings of the 29th European paediatric rheumatology congress [^116m9cnw]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Patient-parent feedback on canakinumab use was overwhelmingly positive. No longer having to administer daily anakinra injections, less travelling time to national specialist centre for canakinumab administration (a 12 hour round trip journey for many patients), less disease flares and overall improved QOL were key feedback findings received.

Conclusion: In our cohort of patients who received canakinumab, the majority have had adequate disease control and importantly has had a positive impact on patient & family QOL. It was an important reminder in the 1 case where canakinumab failed that anakinra still remains a valuable therapeutic option. Future consideration to delivering canakinumab in the community setting outside of hospital would further improve patient-family satisfaction and reduce hospital clinic attendances.

### The most recent advances in pathophysiology and management of tumour necrosis factor receptor-associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS): personal experience and literature review [^114YmDQr]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2013). Low credibility.

Tumour necrosis factor-receptor associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS) is a rare autosomal dominant autoinflammatory disorder characterised by recurrent episodes of long-lasting fever and inflammation in different regions of the body, as musculo-skeletal system, skin, gastrointestinal tube, serosal membranes and eye. Inflammatory attacks usually start in the pediatric age with initial corticosteroid-responsiveness. Most reported cases of TRAPS involve patients of European ancestry and diagnosis can be formulated by the combination of genetic analysis and a compatible phenotype. Its prognosis is strictly dependent on the appearance of amyloidosis, secondary to uncontrolled relapsing inflammation. Thanks to a better understanding of its pathogenesis, the disease is now managed with anti-interleukin (IL)-1 antagonists, rather than corticosteroids or tumour necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors. The aim of this review is to describe the current understanding and advances of TRAPS genetic basis, pathogenesis and management options by integrating the most recent data in the medical literature.

### PFAPA syndrome: clinical characteristics and treatment outcomes in a large single-centre cohort [^112t7fSH]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives

This paper aims to describe clinical and laboratory features and disease outcome in a single-centre cohort of patients with PFAPA syndrome (Periodic Fever, Aphtous stomatitis, Pharyngitis, and Adenitis) and to test performance of diagnostic and therapeutic algorithms.

Methods

Patients fulfilling criteria were selected from the fever clinic population. Prospective follow-up together with recruitment of newly diagnosed patients followed pre-defined guidelines. Diagnostic and therapeutic algorithms and definitions of outcome and therapy response were formulated. Paired blood samples during febrile and afebrile periods were compared.

Results

Out of 176 patients referred for suspected periodic fever 125 children fulfilled criteria. Their age at onset was 23 months, median episode duration 3.5 days at 4-week intervals. Fever was associated with pharyngitis (91%), cervical adenitis (78%) and aphtae (41%). Among therapeutic options, episodic prednisone proved to be the most common first-line treatment. Administered to 77 patients, it reduced symptoms in 94%. Tonsillectomy led to the full symptom resolution in all 18 patients. Forty-six patients reached disease remission.

Conclusions

Distribution of typical symptoms, response to therapies and disease outcome in a large patient cohort were documented. We offer diagnostic and therapeutic algorithms that have proven effective during this prospective trial. Our findings support the general belief of benign nature of this aetiologically unclear condition, despite proportion of patients having persistent disease for years. Maintenance of normal findings in afebrile intervals, striking response to a single dose of prednisone and normal growth and development together with spontaneous tendency towards prolongation of afebrile intervals are important confirmatory features of PFAPA syndrome.

### Prolonged and recurrent fevers in children [^112YUxC3]. The Journal of Infection (2014). Low credibility.

Some children referred for prolonged fever are actually not having elevated temperatures; the approach here requires dissection of the history and correction of health misperceptions. Others have well-documented fevers associated with clinical, laboratory, or epidemiologic findings that should point to a specific diagnosis. "Fever-of-Unknown-Origin" (FUO) is the clinical scenario of daily fever for ≥ 14 days that defies explanation after a careful history, physical examination, and basic laboratory tests. The diagnostic approach requires a meticulous fever diary, serial clinical and laboratory evaluations, vigilance for the appearance of new signs and symptoms, and targeted investigations; the pace of the work-up is determined by the severity of the illness. Approximately half of children with FUO will have a self-limited illness and will never have a specific diagnosis made; the other half will ultimately be found to have, in order, infectious, inflammatory, or neoplastic conditions. Irregular, intermittent, recurrent fevers in the well-appearing child are likely to be sequential viral illnesses. Monogenic autoinflammatory diseases should be considered in those who do not fit the picture of recurrent infections and who do not have hallmarks of immune deficiency. Stereotypical febrile illnesses that recur with clockwork periodicity should raise the possibilities of cyclic neutropenia, if the cycle is approximately 21 days, or periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, and adenitis (PFAPA) syndrome, the most common periodic fever in childhood.

### PFAPA syndrome: a review on treatment and outcome [^116pUf1d]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Outcome

PFAPA syndrome is considered a self-limited disease that generally resolves spontaneously before adolescence. Patients' growth and development are normal and no long-term consequences have been described.

Wurster et al. followed a cohort of 59 patients for a period ranging between 12 and 21 years. Fifty patients experienced spontaneous symptom resolution without relapse; only 9 maintained typical cardinal PFAPA symptoms, though fever was less frequent. They also observed a significantly higher frequency of family history of periodic fever in the patients with persistent symptoms in adulthood.

In a Norwegian cohort, thirty-seven children were followed until resolution with a median follow up of 18.7 months (range 7.2–75.7). The median age at the time of resolution was 52.1 months. Interestingly, eight children experienced a relapse after a febrile attack-free period of more than 6 months. The median duration of the attack-free periods leading up to the relapse was 20 months.

Other studies, with a shorter follow-up, reported a spontaneous resolution in only 20–32% of the patients.

Berkun et al. described a cohort of 124 PFAPA patients, of which 65 showed a single MEFV mutation. PFAPA attacks in MEFV carriers were shorter, compared with patients without mutations, and the frequency of their attacks and oral aphthae were also lower. This may suggest that mutations in causative genes of other monogenic periodic fevers may modify the disease course.

As shown in different studies, PFAPA may have its onset in adulthood as well. To date, no long-term outcome data are available for adult patients diagnosed with PFAPA syndrome, so it is not known whether adults with PFAPA syndrome may spontaneously undergo clinical remission. Based on a review of the recent literature, tonsillectomy does not seem to be a valid option in these patients. There are reports describing adult PFAPA patients with a history of tonsillectomy during childhood due to recurrent febrile tonsillo-pharyngitis, with subsequent disease free period of several years. These findings may suggest that tonsillectomy is efficacious in inducing a temporary remission but that the effect may be transient.

### Predictive factors for therapeutic response and cluster analysis in syndrome of undifferentiated recurrent fever (SURF) [^111Wq3KY]. RMD Open (2025). Medium credibility.

Patients and methods

Patients with undifferentiated recurrent fevers, followed up at the Istituto Giannina Gaslini in Genoa between 2008 and 2024, were included. The criteria used to define recurrent fever followed the most recent classification criteria for autoinflammatory diseases: evidence of elevation of acute phase reactants (erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein or serum amyloid A) during clinical flares, exclusion of confounding diseases (neoplasms, infections, autoimmune conditions, other inborn errors of immunity), and recurrent disease activity for at least 6 months. Data were collected longitudinally; patients with at least two visits were included. A preliminary study on 43 patients with SURF was extended with additional follow-up. Data extraction began in November 2024 and was completed on 31 December 2024. Statistical analysis was conducted in January 2025, and the manuscript was prepared in February 2025.

Exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) follow-up duration shorter than 4 months; (2) alternative diagnosis during follow-up; (3) genetic analysis not performed or unavailable; (4) presence of pathogenic mutations or variants of uncertain significance (VUS) in genes associated with hereditary recurrent fevers (Mediterranean fever gene, mevalonate kinase gene, TNFRSF1A, NLR family pyrin domain containing 3) or other genes of the recurrent fever panel; (5) inflammatory disease progressing to a chronic condition and (6) fulfilment of new PFAPA classification criteria.

Demographics, clinical data and treatment response were extracted from records. Following the acquisition of written informed consent, patients were enrolled in the Eurofever registry, approved by the local ethics committee (Comitato Etico Regione Liguria).

Response to treatment was defined as follows: (1) complete (no symptoms or acute phase reactant elevation between episodes), (2) partial (persistence of some symptoms with ≥ 50% fever episodes reduction) and (3) resistance (minimal/no improvement or worsening).

### Distinguishing among prolonged, recurrent, and periodic fever syndromes: approach of a pediatric infectious diseases subspecialist [^115kjydu]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

Most children with prolonged, recurrent, or periodic fever are healthy and have self-limited, common illnesses, and the primary care practitioner usually can reassure families and continue to reassess the patient as circumstances dictate. For a child with true fever of unknown origin, a pediatric infectious diseases subspecialist should be consulted. This article discusses three objectives for the clinician: (1) to categorize patterns of fever illnesses and prioritize differential diagnoses; (2) to diagnose and manage the most frequently encountered prolonged fever syndrome, deconditioning; and (3) to expand knowledge and approach to diagnosing periodic fever syndromes. The approach described in this article represents the honed, 30-year experience of a pediatric infectious diseases subspecialist.

### Assessment of recurrent fever among children undergoing tonsillectomy [^111XSyCx]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Recurrent tonsillitis, or repeated episodes of palatine tonsil inflammation, is a common indication for tonsillectomy. Prospective randomized controlled trials of tonsillectomy in children with recurrent tonsillitis revealed that those with frequent episodes (≥ 7 episodes in preceding year, ≥ 5 episodes/year for 2 years, and ≥ 3 episodes/year for 3 years) meeting stringent criteria known as the Paradise Criteria had significant benefit from tonsillectomy. Although children with fewer and more loosely defined episodes also had improvement post-tonsillectomy, the effect was modest in that even subjects in the non-surgical control group had very few episodes during the 3-year follow-up period. The authors concluded that the risks of tonsillectomy outweighed the small benefit in patients with recurrent tonsillitis who did not meet the Paradise Criteria.

Recent guidelines for tonsillectomy in children recommend "watchful waiting" for children with recurrent tonsillitis who do not meet Paradise Criteria; however, these guidelines also recommend screening these patients for periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, and cervical adenitis (PFAPA) syndrome. Periodic fever syndromes are characterized by recurrent, stereotypical, noninfectious episodes of fever. Of these syndromes, PFAPA syndrome is considered to be the most common in children. Children with PFAPA typically present with regularly recurring stereotypical fevers episodes accompanied by aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, and/or cervical adenitis, but between flares, they are asymptomatic with normal growth and development. In both observational studies and randomized controlled trials, tonsillectomy was shown to markedly reduce or eliminate febrile episodes in a majority of patients with PFAPA.

Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Current therapeutic studies in PFAPA are limited by small, heterogeneous patient populations, variable diagnostic criteria, retrospective data collection, and treatment analysis that did not include comparator arms between therapeutic options. Our prior survey showed considerable variation in treatment of PFAPA, both between and within subspecialties. Through consensus methodology, we developed standardized regimens that will be studied in future comparative effectiveness studies.

As is the case for other CTPs, they are not intended to be guidelines or recommendations; they merely reflect current management practices. They are also not intended to capture all patients with PFAPA such as those treated with 2 or more arms at the same time or with those that have failed earlier therapies. Other limitations include the lack of validated response criteria, disease monitoring scoring tools and criteria for remission. Furthermore, we did not include all possible therapies and dosing to reduce variability. Even though treatment related morbidity can be monitored; CTPs are not primarily intended to collect information on medication safety. Finally, corticosteroids, cimetidine and colchicine have not received FDA approval for PFAPA.

Future goals are to establish evidence-based management guidelines based on the collection of prospective data from comparative effectiveness trials after implementation of the CTPs, and to identify predictors for response to specific treatments through analysis of patient characteristics in the different treatment arms. The natural history of PFAPA is resolution with age. For the anti-pyretic and corticosteroid arms, since treatment is only with episodes, as they decrease and finally stop, so does treatment. For the prophylactic arms of cimetidine and colchicine, there are no current recommendations on duration of treatment as there is insufficient data.

### Periodic fever syndromes: beyond the single gene paradigm [^1159tGHe]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

An argument for biologically-informed treatment

Colchicine is the treatment of choice in FMF to reduce the severity and duration of symptoms as well as the risk of amyloidosis. However, 5–10% of patients show minimal response to colchicine and at least 30–40% continue to experience attacks. Although generally safe and effective, colchicine's narrow therapeutic window limits dose titration in patients with severe inflammatory phenotypes due to its toxicity. Furthermore, in complete responders, subclinical signs of inflammation such as elevated IL-18 levels may be present during afebrile periods. Alternative treatment strategies include biologic agents targeting IL-1.

Biological therapies to treat FMF have been recently reviewed and include anakinra, an IL-1 receptor antagonist; rilonacept, a dimeric fusion protein that blocks the IL-1 receptor; and canakinumab, a human monoclonal anti-IL-1β antibody. Recent studies in FMF patients with colchicine resistance have shown a significant reduction in attack frequency with anakinra or canakinumab, with a complete response up to 16 weeks of ~ 70% for canakinumab. Other agents that have been considered but with limited evidence to date include etanercept, a fusion protein targeting the tumour necrosis factor-α receptor; infliximab, a chimeric monoclonal antibody to TNF- α; tocilizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting the IL-6 receptor; and tofacitinib, a Janus kinase inhibitor. Regardless of genotype, whether there is a dysregulated response to pro-inflammatory stimuli involving aberrant production of IL-1β or other cytokines can only be established by functional studies (e.g. analysis of enzyme activity, substrate binding/activation, subcellular localization, and cytokine release in response to inflammasome stimuli), which are currently not offered and may not be possible at all health care centres. In more difficult cases, ex vivo analysis of cytokine profiles may contribute not only to our understanding of disease pathogenesis, but also to identification of appropriate therapy. Ultimately, therapy for colchicine-resistant FMF will need to be tailored to individual patients based on our understanding of the pathways affected by their specific mutations.

### PFAPA syndrome: a review on treatment and outcome [^117VXFQS]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The syndrome of periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis and cervical adenitis (PFAPA syndrome) is the most common cause of periodic fever in childhood and it was first described in1987 by Marshall et al. It is characterized by episodes of fever lasting for 3–6 days with recurrence every 3–8 weeks, associated with at least one of three main symptoms: aphthous stomatitis, cervical adenitis, and pharyngitis. Disease onset is usually before the age of 5 and generally resolves by adolescence. Patients are asymptomatic between episodes and show normal growth. Proposed contributors to pathogenesis include infection, abnormal host immune responses, or a combination of both. PFAPA syndrome is an immune mediated disease characterised by a cytokine dysfunction; moreover, the strong familial clustering suggest a potential genetic origin of the syndrome. The presence of variants in inflammasome related genes, mostly in NLRP3 and MEFV, suggest a possible role of these genes in PFAPA pathogenesis. However, none of these variants alone seem to be relevant for the disease etiology, suggesting an oligenic or polygenic background.

Currently the diagnosis of PFAPA is based on clinical criteria (Table 1), but these criteria have not been validated in a cohort of patients. Moreover, Gattorno et al. found that a significant number of patients with monogenic periodic fevers also meet the diagnostic criteria for PFAPA syndrome, highlighting the poor specificity of the current classification criteria. Therefore, patients should be screened clinically or genetically for other known periodic syndromes before assigning the diagnosis of PFAPA.

Table 1
Diagnostic criteria used for PFAPA

PFAPA syndrome has favourable natural history. There is no evidence that medical treatment can modify the outcome, but it can be efficacious for treating the episodes (Table 2). Inducing a rapid remission of episodes is important to improve the quality of life for patients and their families. In this paper we review the current treatment strategies for PFAPA and what is known about the outcome of this syndrome.

Table 2
Pharmacological treatment for PFAPA syndrome

Symptomatic treatment during flares

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents and anti-pyretics have shown poor results in resolving symptoms of PFAPA syndrome. Glucocorticoids are highly effective in aborting the attacks, but there are limited data on the effectiveness of any preventive medication in PFAPA.

### Periodic fever syndromes [^116Cv1JC]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

Human autoinflammatory diseases (except for the periodic fever, adenopathy, pharyngitis, aphthae syndrom) are a heterogeneous group of genetically determined diseases characterized by seemingly unprovoked inflammation, in the absence of autoimmune or infective causes. Tremendous advances in the understanding of these disorders have been seen in the last decade. This article discusses hereditary autoinflammatory syndromes that are associated with recurrent fevers.

Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis and cervical adenitis syndrome (PFAPA) is the most common periodic fever condition in children. The true prevalence and etiology remain unknown although one Scandinavian study estimated the incidence to be 2.3 per 10,000 children. The diagnosis is often delayed, and treatment approaches vary. Patients present in the preschool years with recurrent episodes of high spiking fevers lasting 3 to 7 days and occurring every 2 to 8 weeks. Associated features during the febrile episodes include pharyngitis, cervical lymphadenopathy and/or aphthous stomatitis. PFAPA usually resolves after several years. However, the episodes impact quality of life in both affected children and their families.

Current treatment for PFAPA includes corticosteroids given at the onset of an episode, daily cimetidine or colchicine, and tonsillectomy. However, there is no standard of care for PFAPA due to a lack of clinical trials.

Consensus treatment plans (CTPs) are a relatively new research methodology intended to reduce variation in treatment approaches. This process has been used for other rare diseases such as polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis, systemic-onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis, juvenile dermatomyositis, juvenile localized scleroderma, chronic nonbacterial osteomyelitis and juvenile lupus nephritis. Therapies in use are initially identified through a literature review and physician surveys of current practice strategies. Nominal Group Technique (NGT) is applied to develop standardized CTPs based upon collected data. Major treatment regimens are defined and standardized for the disease in question. Then, in prospective observational studies (after receiving institutional review board approval and obtaining parental permission with patients' assent if applicable), physicians and patients, with their families, select the CTP they prefer, with response assessed based on agreed upon standardized outcome measures. Although this method is not randomized or blinded, it captures the response to therapy of a larger group of patients, typical of those seen in routine practice, prospectively, in a less costly way than double blind, randomized controlled trials. This is a major advantage for the study of rare diseases for which high-quality evidence-based data are lacking.

### Periodic fever syndromes: beyond the single gene paradigm [^111xfaZz]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

In our experience, parents, government funding agencies, and insurers are often resistant to advocating for, and approving coverage for medications when a clinical diagnosis of FMF is not supported by a definitive pathogenic genotype. However, the risks of non-treatment in affected individuals may be significant; the most severe long-term complication of untreated severe FMF is systemic amyloidosis, typically affecting the kidneys and sometimes the adrenals, intestine, spleen, lung, heart, and thyroid. Other sequelae can include recurrent pleural and pericardial effusions and infertility. Untreated patients may also develop splenomegaly, growth retardation, decreased bone density, and premature atherosclerosis. Many patients at our centre who meet clinical diagnostic criteria for FMF do not meet criteria for starting colchicine based on recommendations for MEFV genotype analysis, either because of a single MEFV variant of undetermined significance or because of the presence of two such variants in cis (resulting in a complex allele). Our practical approach in treatment for these patients is to measure SAA levels between attacks, obtain urinalysis to monitor for the appearance of proteinuria, and recommend a therapeutic trial of colchicine for symptomatic patients, consistent with EULAR consensus recommendations for treatment as soon as a clinical diagnosis is made.

Most inclusion criteria for randomized controlled trials of biological therapies – including canakinumab, rilonacept, and anakinra – have required that patients be homozygous or heterozygous for pathogenic MEFV variants. This limits the available data for patients with unusual variants. Ultimately, clear guidelines will be required for access to drug coverage for patients with periodic fever syndromes – ideally incorporating the flexibility to tailor treatment to a patient's unique biology. Coverage for biologic treatments for patients with periodic fever syndromes is limited across the country, and generally relies on having a specific identified genotype. Given our limited understanding of the genetic basis of these diseases, other objective measures based on cellular assays or inflammatory biomarkers, and including clinical features, may ultimately provide the best rationale for specific therapies.

Kawasaki disease — post-acute fever surveillance states that for patients with acute KD with subsequent resolution of fevers, continued daily monitoring is strongly recommended over not monitoring for fevers; patients may experience recurrence or treatment-refractory disease heralded by returning fever and other symptoms, duration of fever is a predictor of coronary artery aneurysms, patients should be monitored daily for fevers for 1–2 weeks after discharge, and caregivers should be instructed to contact the physician if fever recurs because daily monitoring is low cost, without harms, and may identify recurrent KD.

### Clinical and therapeutic aspects of sideroblastic anaemia with B-cell immunodeficiency, periodic fever and developmental delay (SIFD) syndrome: a systematic review [^114ThpA5]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose

Sideroblastic anaemia with B-cell immunodeficiency, periodic fever and developmental delay (SIFD) syndrome is a novel rare autoinflammatory multisystem disorder. We performed a systematic review of the available clinical and therapeutics aspects of the SIFD syndrome.

Methods

A systematic review according to PRISMA approach, including all articles published before the 30 th of July 2021 in Pubmed and EMBASE database, was performed.

Results

The search identified 29 publications describing 58 unique patients. To date, 41 unique mutations have been reported. Onset of disease is very early with a median age of 4 months (range 0–252 months). The most frequent manifestations are haematologic such as microcytic anaemia or sideroblastic anaemia (55/58), recurrent fever (52/58), neurologic abnormalities (48/58), immunologic abnormalities in particular a humoral immunodeficiency (48/58), gastrointestinal signs and symptoms (38/58), eye diseases as cataract and retinitis pigmentosa (27/58), failure to thrive (26/58), mucocutaneous involvement (29/58), sensorineural deafness (19/58) and others. To date, 19 patients (35.85%) died because of disease course (16) and complications of hematopoietic cell stems transplantation (3). The use of anti-TNFα and hematopoietic cell stems transplantation (HCST) is dramatically changing the natural history of this disease.

Conclusions

SIFD syndrome is a novel entity to consider in a child presenting with recurrent fever, anaemia, B-cell immunodeficiency and neurodevelopmental delay. To date, therapeutic guidelines are lacking but anti-TNFα treatment and/or HCST are attractive and might modify the clinical course of this syndrome.

Simvastatin/statins

In a single crossover RCT of simvastatin/placebo in HIDS/MKD patients, 83% of patients reported reduction in number of febrile days with simvastatin at 24 weeks, with significant decrease in urine mevalonic acid levels (table 2). Besides this small RCT, statins were generally reported to be ineffective in most of the patients.

Others

In HIDS/MKD patients, treatment with colchicine alone was shown to be ineffective, however, the combination of colchicine and prednisone showed 100% CR (online supplementary figure 3A–B).NSAIDsand corticosteroidswere shown to provide benefits in some patients. Cyclosporine, thalidomide and antibiotics used in one study were reported as ineffective.

TRAPS

Etanercept

One non-RCTand nine observational studies – provided evidence for etanercept in TRAPS. In the non-RCT, etanercept significantly attenuated the total symptoms score and reduced the symptoms frequency (table 2). In the observational studies with long-term follow-up, 50% of patients achieved a CR with etanercept, whereas 100% achieved a PR (online supplementary figure 4A–B). Other observational studies revealed etanercept provided immediate response and good disease control in TRAPS patients, with resolution of fever and other clinical symptoms.

Canakinumab

One RCT, – one non-RCTand four observational studies – comprised evidence for canakinumab. In the TRAPS cohort of CLUSTER trial described above, – a significantly higher proportion of canakinumab-treated patients achieved the clinical response than placebo (45% vs 8%), with 46% of patients achieving inactive disease at week 16. The clinical response at week 40 was also numerically higher with canakinumab vs placebo (75% vs 40%; table 2). In HRQoL assessments, canakinumab provided early clinically meaningful improvements in SF-12 PCS, CHQ-PF50 PhS and CHQ-PF50 PsS scores at week 5, which were sustained and increased in magnitude by week 16. In the Phase II non-RCT, 19/20 patients (95%) with active recurrent/chronic TRAPS achieved a CR with canakinumab. Disease relapsed in all patients during canakinumab withdrawal period, but similar responses were attained and sustained on retreatment with canakinumab. In the observational studies, 100% of patients achieved a CR with canakinumab at mid-and long-term follow-up (online supplementary figure 4A–B). Other observational studies reported the positive effects of canakinumab with resolution of systemic manifestations and normal levels of APRs.

### International retrospective chart review of treatment patterns in severe familial mediterranean fever, tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated periodic syndrome, and mevalonate kinase deficiency / hyperimmunoglobulinemia D syndrome [^115FDpUS]. Arthritis Care & Research (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

Periodic fever syndrome (PFS) conditions are characterized by recurrent attacks of fever and localized inflammation. This study examined the diagnostic pathway and treatments at tertiary centers for familial Mediterranean fever (FMF), tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS), and mevalonate kinase deficiency (MKD)/hyperimmunoglobulinemia D syndrome (HIDS).

Methods

PFS specialists at medical centers in the US, the European Union, and the eastern Mediterranean participated in a retrospective chart review, providing de-identified data in an electronic case report form. Patients were treated between 2008 and 2012, with at least 1 year of followup; all had clinical and/or genetically proven disease and were on/eligible for biologic treatment.

Results

A total of 134 patients were analyzed: FMF (n = 49), TRAPS (n = 47), and MKD/HIDS (n = 38). Fever was commonly reported as severe across all indications. Other frequently reported severe symptoms were serositis for FMF patients and elevated acute-phase reactants and gastrointestinal upset for TRAPS and MKD/HIDS. A long delay from disease onset to diagnosis was seen within TRAPS and MKD/HIDS (5.8 and 7.1 years, respectively) compared to a 1.8-year delay in FMF patients. An equal proportion of TRAPS patients first received anti-interleukin-1 (anti-IL-1) and anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) biologic agents, whereas IL-1 blockade was the main choice for FMF patients resistant to colchicine and MKD/HIDS patients. For TRAPS patients, treatment with anakinra versus anti-TNF treatments as first biologic agent resulted in significantly higher clinical and biochemical responses (P = 0.03 and P < 0.01, respectively). No significant differences in responses were observed between biologic agents among other cohorts.

Conclusion

Referral patterns and diagnostic delays highlight the need for greater awareness and improved diagnostics for PFS. This real-world treatment assessment supports the need for further refinement of treatment practices.

### Pediatric recurrent fever and autoinflammation from the perspective of an allergist / immunologist [^115yX8aJ]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). Medium credibility.

Autoinflammatory diseases are monogenic and polygenic disorders due to dysregulation of the innate immune system. The inherited conditions have been clustered with primary immunodeficiencies in the latest practice parameters; however, these diseases have unique clinical presentations, genetics, and available therapies. Given the presentation of fevers, rashes, and mucosal symptoms observed in many of these syndromes, patients are likely to present to an allergist/immunologist. Although there has been attention in the literature to diagnosis and treatment of rare, genetically defined autoinflammatory disorders, physicians are challenged by increasing numbers of patients with intermittent or periodic fevers who face unnecessary morbidities due to a lack of a diagnosis. The broad differential of diseases presenting with fever includes autoinflammatory syndromes, infections associated with immunodeficiency and/or allergies complicated by infection, and less commonly, autoimmune disorders or malignancy. To address this challenge, we review the history of the medical approach to fever, current diagnostic paradigms, and controversies in management. We describe the spectrum of disorders referred to a recurrent fever disorders clinic established in an Allergy/Immunology division at a tertiary pediatric care center. Finally, we provide practical recommendations including historical features and initial laboratory investigations that can help clinicians appropriately manage these patients.

### Validation of the new classification criteria for hereditary recurrent fever in an independent cohort: experience from the JIR cohort database [^1121UPa1]. Rheumatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

The new classification criteria for the hereditary recurrent fever (HRF) syndrome [cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome (CAPS), TNF-α receptor-associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS), FMF and mevalonate kinase deficiency] have been published recently. These criteria define two core sets of criteria for each HRF: mixed criteria, including genetic and clinical variables, and clinical criteria, relying on clinical variables only. Our aim was to validate the criteria for HRF in an independent cohort, the JIR Cohort database, an international repository of systemic inflammatory diseases.

Methods

We enrolled patients with HRF, periodic fever, adenitis, pharyngitis and aphthous stomatitis syndrome (PFAPA) and syndrome of undefined recurrent fever (SURF). A score ranging from zero to two was attributed to their respective genotypes: zero (no mutation), one (non-confirmatory genotype) or two (confirmatory genotype). The criteria were applied to all patients based on genotype scoring. The treating physician's diagnosis served as the gold standard for the determination of specificity.

Results

We included 455 patients. The classification criteria showed excellent specificity for CAPS and TRAPS (98% specificity each), fair specificity for FMF (88%), but poor specificity for mevalonate kinase deficiency (58%). Sub-analysis showed excellent accuracy of the mixed criteria for all four HRFs. Misclassification was mainly attributable to clinical criteria sets, with false-positive patients in all four HRF clinical criteria sets.

Conclusion

This study represents the final validation step of the HRF classification criteria as recommended by the ACR. Genetic data appear to be necessary to classify patients with HRF correctly.

Efficacy of colchicine over time: 1-year, 2-year and 5-year analyses

In addition to the cumulative efficacy of colchicine therapy over the treatment period, available for the previously mentioned 77 patients, efficacy was also evaluated at 1 year, 2 years and 5 years. Data on colchicine efficacy were available for 66 patients at 1 year, 50 patients at 2 years and 20 patients at 5 years after starting therapy. Colchicine maintained good efficacy over time, particularly during the first 2 years of treatment. The increase in resistance, reaching 20% in the 5-year group, reflects the unchanged number of non-responsive patients. Specifically, the four colchicine-resistant patients exhibited resistance within the first year of therapy. One additional non-responsive patient was excluded from this specific analysis, as 1 year of follow-up had not yet been completed, while another one became resistant only after 15 years of therapy. As a result, despite the apparent unfavourable trend, the number of non-responsive patients remained unchanged (figure 2B).

Colchicine therapy discontinuation

Out of 84 patients treated with colchicine, 40 subjects discontinued the drug during follow-up. The primary reason for discontinuation was clinical improvement or remission (figure 2C). Notably, among the 40 patients reported, (1) 14 discontinued colchicine and later restarted it due to disease relapse. This group (n = 14) had a median follow-up duration of 108.52 months (IQR 79.07; 133.5), with a median duration of colchicine therapy of 93.62 (IQR 44.8; 116.73); (2) 26 patients discontinued colchicine without resuming it. Of these, eight — having a median follow-up duration of 49.8 (IQR 18.15; 103.57) and a median colchicine therapy duration of 15.18 months (IQR 4.62; 41.58) — experienced a relapse. 3 patients remained in remission, while data were missing for 15 patients.

Intolerance or adverse events were reported in 17.5% of patients, while inefficacy accounted for 10%. Additionally, 5% of patients discontinued therapy due to a combination of intolerance and inefficacy, while one patient (2.5%) stopped for family decision (figure 2C).

Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

The prophylaxis arms were intended to examine the efficacy of cimetidine and colchicine, although there is limited evidence in the literature on their effectiveness. While other drugs were candidates for prophylaxis (e.g. montelukast), only publications in peer-reviewed journals were included. Prophylaxis could be chosen by the physician as a first choice or after a failure of another arm.

There were a few small studies reporting a correlation between vitamin D insufficiency/deficiency and PFAPA and one which found benefit of vitamin supplementation. However, while promising; this preliminary evidence was not considered sufficient to suggest Vitamin D as prophylactic therapy for PFAPA.

Tonsillectomy has been reported to prevent recurrences and while this may be effective for patients with PFAPA, it is not without risk. Although two small randomized control trials suggested that patients with PFAPA have less fever and less severe episodes after tonsillectomy compared to those receiving no surgery, a Cochrane review concluded that this evidence is of moderate quality (meaning that further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect) due to the small numbers of patients in the studies and concerns about the generalizability of the results. Moreover, the number of patients randomly allocated to surgery was too small to detect potentially important complications. Currently there are no data on the efficacy of tonsillotomy in PFAPA and therefore it was not included in the CTP.

Evidence for IL-1 blockade, while promising, was anecdotal or based on small case series and uncontrolled trials so was not included as a therapeutic option.

For treatment arms, the benefits need to be carefully weighed against the risks, given the relatively benign and self-limiting nature of PFAPA.

PFAPA, like other diseases studied by consensus methodology, has no validated response measures, making comparisons between treatment arms challenging. Therefore, we established response criteria a priori (Table 2). Fever was chosen as the primary outcome measure. The quality of life measures were tailored to the periodic nature of PFAPA. Since PFAPA does not confer clinical sequlae (unlike FMF for example which may cause amyloidosis) and is mainly a quality of life problem, the occurrence of inflammatory marker elevation in between episodes was not considered a response criterion. Moreover, if a child with an assumed diagnosis of PFAPA has persistently elevated inflammatory markers then the diagnosis of PFAPA is incorrect.

Background: Syndrome of Undifferentiated Recurrent Fevers (SURF) is an understudied and poorly defined disease entity. It causes significant financial and emotional burden to patients and their families and is difficult to diagnose and manage. Our preliminary data suggest that at least two distinct groups exist within SURF with unique cytokine profiles. The goal of this study is to group patients diagnosed with SURF by endotype, identify candidate driving forces behind each group, and determine best treatment practices for SURF patients. Our hypothesis is that distinct groups exist within SURF, and that each group has unique clinical and cytokine characteristics, as well as different responses to treatment. The first specific aim of this study is to group SURF patients according to endotype using their clinical symptoms and cytokine findings. The second specific aim is to determine the characteristics and variables of SURF patients likely to benefit from early biologic initiation. Secondary outcomes from this aim will be to identify characteristics and variables of patients who experience disease control with on-demand steroids, colchicine, or cimetidine alone.

Methods: Patients diagnosed with SURF after March 2018 are being enrolled into this study at Cincinnati Children's, Texas Children's, Boston Children's, and University of Michigan. Inclusion criteria for SURF includes: 1) age between 0–18, 2) history of recurrent fevers, defined as at least 3 episodes in the past that cannot be attributed to infection or other disease, 3) fever episodes are stereotypical, 4) not consistent with PFAPA or a hereditary fever syndrome based on the 2019 Eurofever/PRINTO criteria, and 4) negative genetic testing if symptoms are consistent with an HRF. Demographics, clinical course, and treatment responses will be recorded in REDCap, and some patients will provide biosamples for multiplex cytokine analysis, which will be performed at CCHMC.

Results

The PFAPA Work Group defined patient inclusion characteristics (Table 1) that were slightly modified from the original proposed diagnostic criteria for PFAPA. First, the duration of fever attacks was defined as 3–7 days to avoid confusion with other autoinflammatory syndromes that may share some features with PFAPA but differ in their duration of febrile attacks, such as Familial Mediterranean Fever. Second, to exclude recurrent infections and malignancy, patients had to have had more than 6 stereotypical periodic febrile episodes. Exclusion of cyclic neutropenia is kept. Third, to ensure periodicity, these episodes had to occur with regularity, defined as a maximum variability of 1 week for fever cycles occurring at 2–4-week intervals and a maximum variability of 2 weeks for fever cycles occurring at 5–8-week intervals. Fourth, age of onset ≤ 5 years was omitted because only one-third of the physicians who responded to the preliminary survery considered young age mandatory for the diagnosis of PFAPA. 5,

Table 1
CTPs inclusion/exclusion criteria for patients with PFAPA

Four treatment strategies were defined based on the literature review, survey, and the process as described above:

1) Antipyretics during episodes; 2) Abortive treatment with corticosteroids; 3) Prophylaxis with colchicine or cimetidine; and 4) Surgical management with tonsillectomy (Fig. 1).

Fig. 1
Consensus treatment plans for PFAPA

To evaluate efficacy, outcome measures were defined by the Work Group (Table 2) using NGT. The primary outcome was resolution of fever, categorized as complete (no fevers for 3 months), partial (reduced total number of days with fever over a period of 3 months), and no response (no change or increase in total days of fever over a period of 3 months). The group agreed that a particular regimen should be trialed for 3 febrile episodes to determine efficacy and, if deemed not effective by the physician and/or family, changed to another arm. Quality of life will be measured by missed school days and parental global assessment using a visual analog scale (a unidimensional measure of a characteristic or attitude that cannot easily be directly measured and is frequently used in populations with rheumatic diseases).

Demographic and clinical characteristics of the cohort

Our cohort consisted predominantly of male subjects and mainly of European origin. Only 18.8% had a family history of recurrent fever. The median age of onset was 2.6 years, with a median age at diagnosis of 6.5 years, revealing a significant diagnostic delay. Regular fever periodicity was observed in 62.4% of patients (table 1). The median number of visits was 6 (IQR 3; 8). 18 patients were studied with a four-gene mini panel for recurrent fevers, 20 patients with NGS analysis and 5 patients with exome sequencing with applied in silico panel for recurrent fevers, while 58 patients with exome sequencing with applied in silico extended panel for autoinflammatory diseases (online supplemental table 1).

Table 1
Demographic features of the 101 SURF patients

The most commonly observed symptoms included fever (100%), arthralgia (72.3%), abdominal pain (65.3%) and myalgia (55.5%). Monoarthritis, generalised lymph node enlargement and oligoarthritis were rare (figure 1).

Clinical characteristics of the 101 described patients. The X-axis represents the number of patients. The frequency of each symptom, listed on the Y-axis, is shown as a percentage and stratified in green for symptoms present 'Always' and in light blue for symptoms present 'Often/Sometimes'.

In terms of symptom frequency patterns, fever was nearly universally persistent during inflammatory episodes, with 94.1% of patients experiencing it 'Always' and a minority (5.9%) 'Sometimes'. Arthralgia and abdominal pain were also prominent, though less consistent, being 'Always' present in 41.6% and 38.6% of patients, respectively, with additional patients reporting them periodically. Myalgia followed a similar trend, affecting one-third of patients continuously. PFAPA-like symptoms, such as cervical lymphadenopathy and aphthous stomatitis, were often intermittent, affecting around one-third of patients 'Sometimes'. Tonsillitis, diarrhoea, vomiting and chest pain occurred less frequently and mainly as periodic issues, while skin rashes, monoarthritis and generalised lymph node enlargement were rare and episodic (figure 1).

Clinical course and response to treatment

The first-line therapy consisted of colchicine, with 84 out of 101 patients receiving it during their follow-up.

### Cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome [^115b1D6S]. Pediatric Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS) are characterized by apparently unprovoked attacks of fever, rashes, and musculoskeletal and sensorineural inflammation accompanied by high acute-phase reactants. Excessive interleukin-1 (IL-1) signaling appears to be a constant feature in the pathomechanism of the disease, driven by a gain-of-function mutation in the NLRP3 gene. Herein, we present the case of a 9-month-old boy with recurrent nonpruritic rashes and episodes of fever. The difficulties of early diagnosis due to initially mild clinical symptoms and the dramatic response to anti-IL-1 therapy after diagnosis emphasize the practical relevance of considering CAPS as a differential diagnosis in these patients.

Introduction: Tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS) is characterized by recurrent episodes of fever, lasting 1–3 weeks, associated with myalgia, conjunctivitis, periorbital oedema, abdominal pain, arthralgia/arthritis, and skin rash.

Objectives: We present a clinical case its management and outcome.

Methods: Medical chart review

Results: We describe the case of a patient first seen in 2016 for episodes of fever lasting 15 days and abdominal pain with elevated acute phase reactants, which subsequently normalized after the resolution of the symptoms.

His mother had been diagnosed in childhood with familial Mediterranean fever, without diagnostic confirmation, and treated with colchicine with a good response.

Because of the clinical manifestations and the family history, a genetic study was carried out, in which a mutation was found: c.197C > T, p.(Thr661Ile) in the TNFRSF1A gene.

Initially, the flare-ups were treated with prednisone with a good response, maintaining normal serum amyloid A between crises. However, the frequency of these flare-ups increased, so a treatment with anakinra was started, also with a good response. Given the difficulty for the patient to adhere to the daily subcutaneous treatment and given the immediate response to a single dose, we decided to administer anakinra for only 7 days during the crises.

With this regime, the patient controlled the disease adequately and had good adherence. However, in the last year, the crises have become more frequent and in the last inter-crisis analysis, an increase in serum amyloid A has been observed.

Clinical manifestations of SAIDs often occur sever, so early recognition and treatment are essential to reduce the incidence of complications and enhance the quality of life. With the availability of genetic sequencing technology, more patients and new autoinflammatory diseases will be diagnosed. There are numerous cases reported in the literature describing the successful use of anakinra and canakinumab to treat these IL-1 mediated disorders. However, IL-1 blocking treatments are not efficacious for all IL-1 mediated monogenic SAIDs, so other cytokines maybe play an essential role in the pathogenetic process in addition to IL-1. The molecular bases for cytokine amplification and the development of novel treatments are still to be discovered in most SAIDs. At the same time, it is also hoped that pediatricians, in the face of children with recurrent fever, recurrent rash, and poor effects of routine treatment, should be vigilant against SAIDs, and conduct gene testing and treatment in time.

### Sweet's syndrome: a review of current treatment options [^115xihA7]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2002). Low credibility.

Sweet's syndrome was originally described in 1964 by Dr Robert Douglas Sweet as an 'acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis'. The syndrome is characterized by pyrexia, elevated neutrophil count, painful red papules, nodules, plaques (which may be recurrent) and an infiltrate consisting predominantly of mature neutrophils that are diffusely distributed in the upper dermis. In addition to skin and mucosal lesions, Sweet's syndrome can also present with extra-cutaneous manifestations. Sweet's syndrome can be classified based upon the clinical setting in which it occurs: classical or idiopathic Sweet's syndrome, malignancy-associated Sweet's syndrome and drug-induced Sweet's syndrome. Systemic corticosteroids have been considered the 'gold standard' for the treatment of patients with Sweet's syndrome; in addition, treatment with topical and/or intralesional corticosteroids may be effective as either monotherapy or adjuvant therapy. However, spontaneous resolution of the symptoms and lesions has occurred in several patients with Sweet's syndrome for whom disease-specific therapeutic intervention was not initiated and in some of the patients with drug-induced Sweet's syndrome after withdrawal of the dermatosis-causing medication. Oral therapy with either potassium iodide or colchicine typically results in rapid resolution of Sweet's syndrome symptoms and lesions; therefore, in patients with Sweet's syndrome who have a potential systemic infection or in whom corticosteroids are contraindicated, it is reasonable to initiate treatment with these agents as a first-line therapy. Indomethacin, clofazimine, dapsone, and cyclosporine have also been effective therapeutic agents for managing Sweet's syndrome. However, indomethacin and clofazimine appear less effective than corticosteroids, potassium iodide, and colchicine. Appropriate initial and follow-up laboratory monitoring is necessary when treating with either dapsone or cyclosporine because of the potential for severe adverse drug-associated effects. Systemic antibacterials with activity against Staphylococcus aureus frequently result in partial improvement of Sweet's syndrome lesions when they are impetiginized or secondarily infected. In some patients with dermatosis-associated bacterial infections, organism-sensitive specific systemic antibacterials have been helpful in the management of their Sweet's syndrome. Although patients with hematologic malignancy-associated Sweet's syndrome often receive cytotoxic chemotherapy agents and antimetabolic drugs for the treatment of their underlying disorder, these agents are seldom used solely for the management of the symptoms and lesions of Sweet's syndrome. The treatment of patients with Sweet's syndrome with either etretinate or interferon-alpha have been reported as single case reports; both patients had improvement of not only their Sweet's syndrome lesions, but also their associated hematologic disorder.

### Familial autoinflammatory diseases: genetics, pathogenesis and treatment [^114BdHXS]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The systemic autoinflammatory diseases are characterized by seemingly unprovoked inflammation, without major involvement of the adaptive immune system. This review focuses mainly on a subset of these illnesses, the hereditary recurrent fevers, which include familial Mediterranean fever, the tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated periodic syndrome, the hyperimmunoglobulinemia D with periodic fever syndrome, and cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes. This review elucidates how recent advances have impacted diagnosis, pathogenesis, and treatment.

Recent Findings

More than 170 mutations have been identified in the four genes underlying the six hereditary recurrent fevers. Genetic testing has broadened the clinical and geographic boundaries of these illnesses, given rise to the concept of the cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes as a disease spectrum, and permitted diagnosis of compound heterozygotes for mutations in two different hereditary recurrent fever genes. Genetics has also advanced our understanding of amyloidosis, a complication of the hereditary recurrent fevers, and suggested a possible role for common hereditary recurrent fever variants in other inflammatory conditions. Recent advances in molecular pathophysiology include the elucidation of the N-terminal PYRIN domain in protein-protein interactions, the description of the NALP3 (cryopyrin) inflammasome as a macromolecular complex for interleukin-1beta activation, and the identification of signaling defects other than defective receptor shedding in patients with tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated periodic syndrome. These molecular insights form the conceptual basis for targeted biologic therapies.

Summary

Advances in molecular genetics extend our ability to recognize and treat patients with systemic autoinflammatory diseases and inform our understanding of the regulation of innate immunity in humans.

### Epidemiology and clinical features of PFAPA: a retrospective cohort study of 336 patients in Western Sweden [^114H1EHS]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

In addition to the need to segregate PFAPA syndrome from mAID, it must also be distinguished from the more heterogenous group of patients with recurrent fever who do not fulfill the clinical or genetic criteria for any defined AID. This group is often referred to as undefined/undifferentiated AID (uAID) or syndromes of undifferentiated recurrent fever (SURF). As the diagnostic criteria for PFAPA are still a subject of debate, it is not clear which patients with PFAPA-like disease but with a not entirely typical presentation should be regarded as PFAPA and which should be included in the more ambiguous group of uAID/SURF. Our study shows that PFAPA patients who fulfill the modified Marshall criteria and display additional atypical features are similar to patients without atypical features regarding age of onset, sex and response to treatment. While our study confirms that the age of onset of PFAPA is < 5 years of age in most patients, this is not an absolute limit and patients with onset in older ages should also be classified as PFAPA if they fulfil the other criteria. We propose that patients who do not have the key features of regularity and signs and symptoms from the oro-pharyngeal area should be designated SURF. Further studies need to be conducted to investigate whether these patients are different from PFAPA patients regarding the prognosis and outcome of treatment.

### Consensus protocols for the diagnosis and management of the hereditary autoinflammatory syndromes CAPS, TRAPS and MKD / HIDS: a German PRO-KIND initiative [^113QqW2m]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Rare autoinflammatory diseases (AIDs) including Cryopyrin-Associated Periodic Syndrome (CAPS), Tumor Necrosis Receptor-Associated Periodic Syndrome (TRAPS) and Mevalonate Kinase Deficiency Syndrome (MKD)/ Hyper-IgD Syndrome (HIDS) are genetically defined and characterized by recurrent fever episodes and inflammatory organ manifestations. Early diagnosis and early start of effective therapies control the inflammation and prevent organ damage. The PRO-KIND initiative of the German Society of Pediatric Rheumatology (GKJR) aims to harmonize the diagnosis and management of children with rheumatic diseases nationally. The task of the PRO-KIND CAPS/TRAPS/MKD/HIDS working group was to develop evidence-based, consensus diagnosis and management protocols including the first AID treat-to-target strategies.

Methods

The national CAPS/TRAPS/MKD/HIDS expert working group was established, defined its aims and conducted a comprehensive literature review synthesising the recent (2013 to 2018) published evidence including all available recommendations for diagnosis and management. General and disease-specific statements were anchored in the 2015 SHARE recommendations. An iterative expert review process discussed, adapted and refined these statements. Ultimately the GKJR membership vetted the proposed consensus statements, agreement of 80% was mandatory for inclusion. The approved statements were integrated into three disease specific consensus treatment plans (CTPs). These were developed to enable the implementation of evidence-based, standardized care into clinical practice.

Results

The CAPS/TRAPS/MKD/HIDS expert working group of 12 German and Austrian paediatric rheumatologists completed the evidence synthesis and modified a total of 38 statements based on the SHARE recommendation framework. In iterative reviews 36 reached the mandatory agreement threshold of 80% in the final GKJR member survey. These included 9 overarching principles and 27 disease-specific statements (7 for CAPS, 11 TRAPS, 9 MKD/HIDS). A diagnostic algorithm was established based on the synthesized evidence. Statements were integrated into diagnosis- and disease activity specific treat-to-target CTPs for CAPS, TRAPS and MKD/HIDS.

Conclusions

The PRO-KIND CAPS/TRAPS/MKD/HIDS working group established the first evidence-based, actionable treat-to-target consensus treatment plans for three rare hereditary autoinflammatory diseases. These provide a path to a rapid evaluation, effective control of disease activity and tailored adjustment of therapies. Their implementation will decrease variation in care and optimize health outcomes for children with AID.

### Predictive factors for therapeutic response and cluster analysis in syndrome of undifferentiated recurrent fever (SURF) [^116H1fHW]. RMD Open (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In the era of next-generation sequencing (NGS), a paradox exists with a subset of patients whose symptoms closely resemble familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) but lack known causative mutations. These patients experience recurrent systemic inflammation episodes with fever, mainly associated with abdominal pain and arthralgia, not meeting the criteria to be classified as periodic fever with aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis and adenopathy (PFAPA) syndrome.

This group of patients, first defined as syndrome of undifferentiated recurrent fever (SURF) by Broderick et al, has been further discussed in recent reviews.NGS studies have been pivotal in identifying undifferentiated recurrent fevers outside known hereditary fevers or PFAPA. Approximately 20% of SURF patients present with variants of uncertain significance, although definitive pathogenic mutations cannot be found.

Various groups have addressed the diagnostic challenges in systemic autoinflammatory disease (SAID) patients who lack criteria for monogenic forms. In 2020, Demir et al applied a 16-gene panel to patients with clinical features suggestive of SAIDs but no specific diagnostic markers. Some were diagnosed with monogenic SAIDs, while many were classified as 'undefined SAID', often responding to colchicine or anti-interleukin-1 (IL-1) therapies. These findings highlight shared inflammatory pathways and limitations in current diagnostic criteria.

A study on 39 SURF patients reported fever, arthralgia, abdominal pain and variable colchicine responses. Our previous study confirmed colchicine's effectiveness in a homogeneous SURF cohort.

Data from the Eurofever registry revealed significant heterogeneity among recurrent fever cases without molecular diagnoses. This study identified overlaps between SURF and PFAPA, emphasising the need for refined classification criteria. Similarly, investigations in adult SURF patients showed variability in colchicine responses, underscoring the importance of personalised therapeutic strategies and novel diagnostic markers to distinguish SURF from other autoinflammatory conditions.

The mechanism of SURF remains unclear, but recent studies identified a distinct tonsillar inflammatory signature. The first cytokine analysis in SURF patients revealed a highly inflammatory subset. Our recent work showed minor pyrin inflammasome activation in naïve SURF patients compared with FMF, PFAPA and colchicine-treated SURF. These findings suggest a unique functional mechanism, possibly cytoskeleton-related, as colchicine normalised the response.

Colchicine, used as a continuous therapy, has demonstrated an average 60% efficacy rate, reinforcing its role in long-term management despite the absence of a defined molecular target. IL-1 blockers (anakinra, canakinumab) offer an alternative for colchicine-unresponsive cases.

### Targeting interleukin-1 β in CAPS (cryopyrin-associated periodic) syndromes: what did we learn? [^114SMpJp]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

CAPS is the prototype of an IL-1β driven auto inflammatory disorder. Features of recurrent systemic inflammation compromises patient's quality of life, and may reduce life expectancy by inducing definite organ damage. Recent treatment targeting IL-1 have shown dramatic effect on patient's clinical symptoms and quality of life. Anakinra was first used successfully in treating small series of patients with all CAPS phenotypes. Two pivotal randomized placebo-controlled studies allowed licensing of rilonacept and canakinumab as orphan drugs for CAPS patients. The use of anti-IL-1 drugs in CAPS is still relatively new, and their effect on a long term is not well known. As we can suppress the clinical symptoms of patients with CAPS, important questions remain regarding the full effect of anti-IL-1 treatment on organ involvement and their potential ability to prevent them. As important variations of treatment doses and schedules appear in reaching effectiveness, pharmacologic studies are still warranted to determine a potential diffusion of anti-IL-1 drugs in the fluids and tissues. More studies evaluating the efficacy and safety of anti-IL-1 drugs given in patients before 2 years of age are warranted, since it is believed that the earliest treatment could avoid secondary CAPS complications to develop.

Introduction: SURF syndrome, a recent described clinical entity, differs from other monogenic recurrent fevers and PFAPA syndrome. Although clinically similar to familial Mediterranean fever, they lack compatible genetics. Our recent study further delineates biological differences between SURF, FMF and PFAPA.(1,2)

Objectives: To describe, updating and supplementing the existing literature data, the follow-up of a homogeneous cohort of 90 patients with SURF, managed at a tertiary referral center.

Methods: Patients followed for SURF from 2008 to 2023 were retrospectively included. Exclusions criteria were: confirmed mutations for monogenic recurrent fever (extensive NGS panel) or meeting Eurofever criteria for PFAPA. Treatment response was categorized as:i) complete response (no symptoms and normal acute phase reactants), ii) partial response (symptoms persist with ≥ 50% reduction in fever episodes), iii) resistance (minimal or no improvement, or worsening).

### Therapeutic approach to familial mediterranean fever: a review update [^112C4qCP]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2011). Low credibility.

Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is a hereditary disorder characterised by recurrent attacks of fever with peritonitis or pleuritis, arthritis, myalgia or erysipelas-like skin lesions. The continuous inflammation in FMF is associated with increased serum amyloid A (SAA) protein which may lead to secondary amyloidosis and deposition of this insoluble protein in the kidney, gut, spleen, liver, heart etc. Therefore, treatment of patients with FMF is beneficial not only for the prevention of the acute attacks but also for improving their prognosis. In the present review we summarise the medical literature concerning FMF treatment, including new therapeutic agents and management of colchicine-resistant patients. Three electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library) were searched from 1 January 1960 to 28 February 2010 for any therapeutic approach to FMF, with MeSH headings and text words (Familial Mediterranean Fever, FMF treatment, colchicine, infliximab, anakinra, SSRI). In conclusion, colchicine remains the mainstay therapeutic option in FMF. It is effective in various manifestations of the disease such as fever, peritonitis and pleuritis. It prevents the development of amyloidosis. It is safe in humans regarding fertility, and can be used during pregnancy and nursing. Dose adjustment should be made in patients with renal or hepatic failure. It is less effective in arthritis or myalgia, requiring additional treatment with NSAIDs and steroids. In the few cases where FMF is resistant to colchicine other measures, including corticosteroids, non-biological and biological DMARDs, interferon alpha and SSRIs should be employed.

### Periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, and adenitis syndrome and syndrome of unexplained recurrent fevers in children and adults [^115iW1aM]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

Children and adults with autoinflammatory disorders, who often experience recurrent fevers, rashes, cold-induced symptoms, conjunctivitis, lymphadenopathy, recurrent infections, aphthous stomatitis, and abnormal blood cell counts, may present to the allergist/immunologist because the symptoms mimic allergies and disorders of immunity. In recent years, there has been increased recognition of non-monogenic autoinflammatory disorders, including periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, and adenitis syndrome and syndrome of undifferentiated recurrent fevers. For many clinical practitioners, the natural history, diagnostic criteria, differential diagnoses, and preferred therapies remain challenging because of the presumed rarity of patients and the evolving field of autoinflammation. Here, we aim to provide a practical framework for the clinical allergist/immunologist to evaluate and treat this patient population.

The periodic fever syndromes are disorders of innate immunity. They may be inherited or acquired and present as recurrent attacks of apparently spontaneous self-limiting inflammation without evidence of autoantibodies or infection. Over the past decade-and-a-half there has been significant progress in their understanding and treatment.

### Treat-to-target strategies for the management of familial mediterranean fever in children [^113M3Rmu]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

The inclusion of the response to colchicine treatment improves the sensitivity of well-established diagnostic criteria and a positive treatment response is commonly used to support the diagnosis of FMF in daily practice. When using colchicine as a diagnostic parameter, the possible placebo effect should be considered and the clinical course should be observed over a sufficiently long observation period.

The clear familial clustering indicates that the occurrence of familial cases supports the diagnosis of FMF in the index patient.

The literature search for statement 3 (differential diagnosis) revealed mostly narrative reviews which underline the importance of considering PFAPA syndrome and recurrent viral infections as the most frequently observed differential diagnoses in this age-group.

The working group agreed that many other differential diagnoses, e.g. haemato-oncological diseases, other monogenic autoinflammatory diseases, immunodeficiencies and recurrent infections should be considered especially in case of unclear presentation and non-confirmatory genotype. Further examinations should be guided by the accompanying symptoms.

Statement 4 (treatment targets) addresses the treatment goals in FMF. Persistent (sub-)clinical inflammation is a frequently observed phenomenon in FMF, with SAA and the S100 molecules representing sensitive markers to detect ongoing inflammation during the attack-free intervals. However, it is not possible to define an evidence-based threshold value for any inflammation parameter predicting the occurrence of damage during follow-up. Existing assessment tools for evaluation of disease activity and severity cover different aspects, e.g. PROMs, clinical manifestation, damage, quality of life and inflammation markers (see also discussion). While these scores have been widely used for assessment in both routine care and clinical trials, the members of the working group agreed that none of these instruments entirely fulfilled the requirements of a thorough target definition to be used in a treatment consensus plan. The proposed newly developed treatment targets (Fig. 2) incorporate multidimensional aspects of disease presentation including physician's and patient's judgment as well as chronic sequelae and allow the definition of different disease activity stages.

Introduction: Autoinflammatory diseases (AID) are a rare subgroup of Juvenile Inflammatory Rheumatisms (JIR) with a significant morbidity and mortality risk; many patients require lifelong medication. The implementation of evidence or consensus-based recommendations for diagnosis and treatment can be challenging due to the wide array of country-specific medical systems, financial capacities, and variable training of physicians in these rare diseases.

Objectives: The main objective of the JIR-CliPS network is to collect real-life clinical practice strategies (CliPS) from physicians worldwide to produce adequate treatment plans for selected JIR.

Secondary objectives are to assess the reasons for discrepancies with existing guidelines and prospectively compare different clinical strategies regarding indications, treatment adjustments, and long-term outcomes.

Methods: Five areas of interest were selected, of which two concern autoinflammatory recurrent fever syndromes: the use of biological drug modifying disease (bDMARDs) in genetic AID and diagnosis and treatment of PFAPA/recurrent fever of unknown significance (SURF). The questionnaires were finalized in 2022, and the project was submitted as a COST (European cooperation for science and technology) action, which was accepted (CA21168).

Since September 2022, the online questionnaires have been distributed through different channels such as the JIRcohort network, national societies, and networks, and are still available. An interim analysis of these questionnaires was performed in April 2023.

Results: Regarding AID questionnaires, 103 physicians from 28 different countries responded, the majority originating from Brazil and Turkey. More pediatricians than adult physicians responded (75% vs 8%), and the experience of the responding physicians was quite high. Even for the most common disease, FMF, 65% of the respondents were not aware of existing national guidelines for the management of the disease.

### Complications of complications: diagnosis and treatment of recurrent macrophage activation syndrome in a patient with well-controlled systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis [^1179mm1W]. RMD Open (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

When faced with a patient with MAS, it is important to maintain a broad differential regarding possible triggers, as this will direct specific treatments. MAS triggered by new-onset SJIA or disease flare can often be effectively treated with high doses of anakinra, directed at the underlying autoinflammation.EBV-driven MAS/HLH is well documented and arises from a different mechanism than MAS triggered by SJIA. EBV typically infects and replicates within B cells; however, the virus can infect T and NK cells via CD21, leading to proliferation of cytotoxic CD8 T cells and cytokine storm with release of TNF and IFNɣ promoting widespread lymphohistiocytic activation. There are few reports on the use of emapalumab and ruxolitinib in the treatment of MAS/secondary HLH. Emapalumab, a fully human anti-IFN gamma monoclonal antibody, has recently been shown to be effective for HLH, and a recent case report exists where a patient with refractory EBV-associated secondary HLH was successfully treated with emapalumab.

Sulfasalazine-induced 3-week syndrome and DRESS are similar and have overlapping features, but whether they are truly synonymous is unclear. Sulfasalazine-induced 3-week syndrome is a hypersensitivity reaction resembling DRESS that occurs secondary to exposure to sulfonamides which, in turn, causes MAS/secondary HLH. While well documented in patients with inflammatory bowel disease and in patients with rheumatoid arthritis being treated with sulfasalazine, this is the first reported case in a rheumatic patient receiving prophylactic TMP/SMX. Typical symptoms are fever, lymphadenopathy, dermatitis, haematological abnormalities and hepatitis around the third week of TMP/SMX initiation, and treatment requires the withdrawal of the offending agent and may require the use of other immune modulators.

DRESS is characterised by fever, skin eruption, internal organ dysfunction and haematologic abnormalities that develop after a new medication is introduced 1–8 weeks prior to the development of symptoms. Diagnostic criteria for DRESS includes the RegiSCAR, Bocquet's and Japanese criteria. While there is overlap between the two syndromes, patients with sulfasalazine-induced 3-week syndrome may not meet criteria for DRESS, as seen in this patient. In addition, patients with DRESS tend to have a prolonged course even after withdrawal of medication, which this patient did not experience. Both syndromes are severe drugs reactions that require timely treatment and withdrawal of the offending agent.

### Unravelling the clinical heterogeneity of undefined recurrent fever over time in the European registries on autoinflammation [^117G7Kkm]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The management of pediatric or young adult patients with SAIDs poses significant challenges for healthcare professionals across multiple specialties, including paediatricians, rheumatologists, and adult clinical immunologists. Among the various autoinflammatory disorders, PFAPA syndrome stands out as a common and well-recognized clinical entity in the pediatric population, while hereditary fever disorders are less frequently diagnosed in the United States and Western Europe. Despite the existence of approved classification criteria for PFAPA, diagnosing this syndrome remains a considerable challenge. Since its initial description in 1987, PFAPA has often been misinterpreted as upper respiratory infections, leading to inappropriate treatment strategies, including unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions. The non-specific nature of PFAPA symptoms, such as recurrent fever, pharyngitis, and cervical adenopathy, complicates diagnosis, which is primarily based on the exclusion of other infectious and autoinflammatory diseases. As a result, definitive diagnosis is typically reserved for specialists with extensive experience in managing this patient population. It is increasingly recognized that a subset of children presenting with non-infectious recurrent fever cannot be classified within existing diagnostic categories. These patients, often referred to as having uSAID or syndrome of SURF, pose unique challenges for clinical management. The current landscape of managing these patients is characterized by the need for updating definitions and classification categories to better characterize and understand this heterogeneous group

The distinction between patients falling into the PFAPA category versus those categorized as uSAID/SURF presents a significant challenge, particularly when considering the clinical patterns and associated symptoms. While some patients may meet criteria for SURF due to variations in periodicity and symptomatology, they could alternatively be classified as PFAPA depending on the criteria used. Our study sheds light on this potential overlap and aims to elucidate the evolving nature of PFAPA and its relationship with uSAID/SURF. PFAPA patients that were evaluated through the registries performed incomplete response towards applied criteria, in which it demonstrated a separate group of non-responders that potentially may perform overlapping group with SURF (Fig. 3). PFAPA is a self-limiting disease that has a favourable prognosis. Usually, it resolves spontaneously before adolescence without impairment of growth and development, yet, with less knowledge about the long-term outcomes of this disease. There are very few data on the prognosis of PFAPA lasting up to adolescence and beyond.

### PFAPA syndrome: a review on treatment and outcome [^116DQqbZ]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusions

PFAPA syndrome is a relatively common condition in childhood, but it can also persist into adulthood. The disease usually has a benign and self-limiting course. Treatment with single doses of glucocorticoids is effective in controlling the fever episodes. Colchicine may be an interesting option for patients with frequent episodes. Tonsillectomy should be reserved for selected patients refractory to medical treatment and children with long-lasting disease affecting the quality of life.

### Predictive factors for therapeutic response and cluster analysis in syndrome of undifferentiated recurrent fever (SURF) [^11394eYy]. RMD Open (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Introduction: Syndrome of undifferentiated recurrent fever (SURF) refers to a group of recurrent fevers without a clear monogenic cause. Clinical spectrum, treatment response predictors and management strategies remain unclear.

Objective: This study aims to longitudinally analyse a homogeneously selected cohort of 101 SURF patients, to identify factors associated with colchicine resistance and to evaluate the efficacy of interleukin-1 (IL-1) inhibitors.

Methods: Patients were enrolled in the Eurofever Registry, carefully excluding those with periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis and cervical adenitis (PFAPA); familial Mediterranean fever and other known monogenic recurrent fevers. Demographic, clinical and treatment data were analysed to identify predictors of colchicine resistance and define subgroups through cluster analysis.

Results: Common symptoms included fever, arthralgia, abdominal pain and myalgia, with PFAPA-like features (lymphadenopathy, tonsillitis, oral aphthae) observed in one-third of cases, sporadically. Colchicine efficacy, assessed in 77 patients, revealed complete response in the majority of patients (61%). Univariable analysis identified PFAPA-like features, including aphthous stomatitis (p = 0.001), cervical lymphadenopathy (p = 0.012) and exudative tonsillitis (p = 0.004), as associated with colchicine resistance. Multivariable analysis confirmed aphthous stomatitis as an independent predictor of resistance (p = 0.014). Tonsillectomy was ineffective. IL-1 inhibitors (anakinra, canakinumab) were beneficial in refractory cases. Cluster analysis revealed three distinct subgroups with varying symptoms and colchicine responses.

Conclusions: These findings provide new insights into SURF, identifying predictors of colchicine resistance and supporting the efficacy of IL-1 blockade. Cluster analysis suggests the heterogeneity within SURF, reinforcing the need for refined diagnostic criteria and personalised treatment strategies.

### Recurrent febrile syndromes: what a rheumatologist needs to know [^115x7Zgc]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2009). Medium credibility.

Rheumatologists are likely to be asked to evaluate patients with recurrent febrile syndromes, so it is important that they are familiar with the clinical and diagnostic features, pathophysiology and therapeutic options for these rare autoinflammatory disorders. These syndromes are all characterized by recurrent episodes of fever and systemic inflammation; however, some syndromes have unique historical and physical features that can help with making a diagnosis. The primary associated morbidity is systemic amyloidosis, usually with renal involvement. Diagnostic testing is mostly limited to genetic testing. NSAIDs, colchicine and corticosteroids have roles in the treatment of some of these disorders, but biologic drugs that target interleukin-1beta are emerging as consistently effective therapies.

Recurrent pericarditis is accompanied by a high morbidity rate and may represent a challenge to the clinician due to problems in management. Therapeutic strategies are not specific and include nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, corticosteroids, immunosuppressive drugs, colchicine, and pericardiectomy. Controlled trials have demonstrated that colchicine can reduce the recurrent rate of pericarditis, whereas early corticosteroid therapy promotes recurrences. Anakinra, a recombinant human interleukin-1β receptor antagonist, is a promising new biologic agent for the treatment of autoinflammatory diseases such as cryopyrinopathies, tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated periodic syndrome, and hyperimmunoglobulinemia D with periodic fever syndrome. This report describes an 11-year-old boy successfully treated with anakinra for a steroid-dependent recurrent pericarditis unresponsive to conventional treatment.

### Simvastatin treatment for inflammatory attacks of the hyperimmunoglobulinemia D and periodic fever syndrome [^115kcn3b]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2004). Low credibility.

Hyperimmunoglobulinemia D (hyper-IgD) and periodic fever syndrome, a hereditary autoinflammatory syndrome, is characterized by lifelong recurrent episodes of fever and inflammation. No effective treatment is known. It is caused by a defect of mevalonate kinase, an enzyme that follows 3'-hydroxy-3'-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase in the isoprenoid pathway. We wanted to test the hypothesis that inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase would ameliorate the inflammatory attacks. Six patients with hyper-IgD syndrome and proven mevalonate kinase deficiency were followed up for 2 treatment periods with either simvastatin, 80 mg/d, or placebo for 24 weeks, separated by a 4-week washout period in a double-blind fashion. Simvastatin resulted in a drop in urinary mevalonic acid concentration in all patients and decreased the number of febrile days in 5 of 6 patients. No side effects were observed. These data offer preliminary evidence for the hypothesis that simvastatin may improve inflammatory attacks in the hyper-IgD syndrome. This highlights the anti-inflammatory properties of HMG-CoA reductase inhibition.

### Recurrent fever syndromes in patients after recovery from Kawasaki syndrome [^116m4iDR]. Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

The recurrence of fever in a child with a history of Kawasaki syndrome (KS) poses a dilemma for clinicians who must consider the possibility of recurrent KS. In this report we present the cases of 4 patients who presented with classical symptoms of KS, were successfully treated with intravenous immunoglobulin, and later experienced a reappearance of inflammatory symptoms in a pattern consistent with a recurrent fever syndrome. The association of these syndromes within the same patient suggests that some patients may have a genetic propensity toward altered immune responses and autoinflammatory syndromes. We propose that these 2 syndromes exist within a family of febrile disorders related to innate immune dysregulation.

Conclusion: We can speculate that children in group A, carrying R202Q mutation, are patients with SURF (Syndrome of undifferentiated recurrent fever, as proposed by M. Gattorno and coll.). 92% responded to colchicine. The clinical presentation of the parents diverged from A to group B: most of the patients of group A do not refer a family history of recurrent fever and/or symptoms of SURF. Most of the patients of group B have a family history of recurrent fever in siblings and parents, and actual records of abdominal pain, arthralgia at the limbs, headache, fatigue.

Introduction: SAPHO is a heterogeneous autoinflammatory disease, characterized by bone and joint involvement and by a wide variety of dermatologic manifestations, including palmo-plantar pustulosis (PPP), acne, hidradenitis suppurativa (HS), pyoderma gangrenosum (PG), psoriasis, Snedd-Wilkinson disease and Sweet syndrome. The SAPHO treatment still today is a challenge, and no therapeutic guidelines are available in children: NSAIDs are frequently used as first line treatment for CRMO lesions, followed by bisphosphonates, methotrexate and biologic therapies. In the literature there are many case reports but only a few case series, of which the present one is the largest in Europe (29 cases reported in China).

### Natural history of mevalonate kinase deficiency: a literature review [^115EoAN7]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Symptoms of MKD, an 'ultra-rare' autosomal recessive autoinflammatory disease, usually begin within the first year of life, but there is a delay by several years in diagnosis. Recurrent febrile attacks are most frequent in childhood and decline with age. MKD impairs HRQOL of patients and their families with a negative impact on patients' daily activities, education, and employment. MKD is associated with serious long-term complications. Although MKD manifested as HIDS in general does not reduce life expectancy, MVA can be life-threatening and cause death in early childhood. Currently, there are no treatments approved for MKD. Off-label use of anti-IL-1 and anti-TNF-α agents and corticosteroids appears to provide some but insufficient benefits. There are concerns on side effects associated with the repeated use of these drugs, especially in children. The development of therapies for MKD is thus needed.

### PFAPA syndrome: a review on treatment and outcome [^114dpoEi]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2016). Low credibility.

The syndrome of periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis and cervical adenitis (PFAPA syndrome) is the most common cause of periodic fever in childhood. The current pharmacological treatment includes corticosteroids, which usually are efficacious in the management of fever episodes, colchicine, for the prophylaxis of febrile episodes, and other medication for which efficacy has not been proven so far. Tonsillectomy is an option for selected patients. Usually PFAPA syndrome resolves during adolescence, but there is increasing evidence that this condition may persist into adulthood.

### Tonsillectomy for periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis and cervical adenitis syndrome (PFAPA) [^112eFy4h]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis and cervical adenitis (PFAPA) syndrome is a rare clinical syndrome of unknown cause usually identified in children. Tonsillectomy is considered a potential treatment option for this syndrome. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2010 and previously updated in 2014.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and safety of tonsillectomy (with or without adenoidectomy) compared with non-surgical treatment in the management of children with PFAPA.

Search Methods

The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Trials Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2019, Issue 4); PubMed; Ovid Embase; CINAHL; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 15 October 2019.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing tonsillectomy (with or without adenoidectomy) with non-surgical treatment in children with PFAPA.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. The primary outcomes were the proportion of children whose symptoms have completely resolved and complications of surgery (haemorrhage and number of days of postoperative pain). Secondary outcomes were: number of episodes of fever and the associated symptoms; severity of episodes; use of corticosteroids; absence or time off school; quality of life. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome.

Main Results

Two trials were included with a total of 67 children randomised (65 analysed); we judged both to be at low risk of bias. One trial of 39 participants recruited children with PFAPA syndrome diagnosed according to rigid, standard criteria. The trial compared adenotonsillectomy to watchful waiting and followed up patients for 18 months. A smaller trial of 28 children applied less stringent criteria for diagnosing PFAPA and probably also included participants with alternative types of recurrent pharyngitis. This trial compared tonsillectomy alone to no treatment and followed up patients for six months. Combining the trial results suggests that patients with PFAPA likely experience less fever and less severe episodes after surgery compared to those receiving no surgery. The risk ratio (RR) for immediate resolution of symptoms after surgery that persisted until the end of follow-up was 4.38 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.64 to 30.11); number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) = 2, calculated based on an estimate that 156 in 1000 untreated children have a resolution) (moderate-certainty evidence). Both trials reported that there were no complications of surgery. However, the numbers of patients randomly allocated to surgery (19 and 14 patients respectively) were too small to detect potentially important complications such as haemorrhage. Surgery probably results in a large overall reduction in the average number of episodes over the total length of follow-up (rate ratio 0.08, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.13), reducing the average frequency of PFAPA episodes from one every two months to slightly less than one every two years (moderate-certainty evidence). Surgery also likely reduces severity, as indicated by the length of PFAPA symptoms during these episodes. One study reported that the average number of days per PFAPA episode was 1.7 days after receiving surgery, compared to 3.5 days in the control group (moderate-certainty evidence). The evidence suggests that the proportion of patients requiring corticosteroids was also lower in the surgery group compared to those receiving no surgery (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.92) (low-certainty evidence). Other outcomes such as absence from school and quality of life were not measured or reported.

Authors' Conclusions

The evidence for the effectiveness of tonsillectomy in children with PFAPA syndrome is derived from two small randomised controlled trials. These trials reported significant beneficial effects of surgery compared to no surgery on immediate and complete symptom resolution (NNTB = 2) and a substantial reduction in the frequency and severity (length of episode) of any further symptoms experienced. However, the evidence is of moderate certainty (further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate) due to the relatively small sample sizes of the studies and some concerns about the applicability of the results. Therefore, the parents and carers of children with PFAPA syndrome must weigh the risks and consequences of surgery against the alternative of using medications. It is well established that children with PFAPA syndrome recover spontaneously and medication can be administered to try and reduce the severity of individual episodes. It is uncertain whether adenoidectomy combined with tonsillectomy adds any additional benefit to tonsillectomy alone.

### Predictive factors for therapeutic response and cluster analysis in syndrome of undifferentiated recurrent fever (SURF) [^114czkEB]. RMD Open (2025). Medium credibility.

IL-1 blocking therapy

Nine patients were treated with IL-1 blocking therapy due to colchicine inefficacy (n = 8) or intolerance (n = 1). Specifically, anakinra was administered to seven patients, initially combined with colchicine in six cases. In one patient, anakinra was quickly discontinued due to an adverse event (generalised cutaneous rash) and replaced with canakinumab. Canakinumab was ultimately given to three patients in total, with two of these also receiving colchicine.

With the limitation of the small patients' sample, IL-1 blocking therapy seemed to be effective in our cohort, though with a lower efficacy rate for canakinumab (partial efficacy in two cases — one with canakinumab alone and the other combined with colchicine) compared with anakinra (online supplemental figure 1).

Tonsillectomy

Tonsillectomy was ineffective in 18 cases, partially effective in 1 case, causing a reduction in the frequency and intensity of febrile episodes.

Treatment status at last follow-up

Median follow-up for the cohort (101 patients) was 38.03 months (table 1). Most patients were on colchicine monotherapy. 25 patients discontinued colchicine by the time of follow-up, of whom 12 due to improvement or remission. Smaller subsets were receiving a combination of colchicine and anakinra or treated exclusively with anakinra. Canakinumab was administered alone or in combination with colchicine. Additionally, 17 patients (16.83%) were never treated, possibly due to mild symptoms or alternative management choices (steroids on demand, refusal of treatment). Out of these 17, 9 patients experienced spontaneous remission or improvement without baseline therapy. Finally, data on treatment status were unavailable for two patients (1.98%) (online supplemental figure 2).

### Efficacy and safety of anti-interleukin-1 treatment in familial mediterranean fever patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111A8JTG]. Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

FMF is the most common hereditary monogenic fever syndrome marked by recurrent attacks of fever and polyserositis. Colchicine is the current recommended first-line treatment for FMF. However, a small portion of FMF patients are unresponsive or intolerant to colchicine. Anti-IL-1 agents are alternative treatment options for colchicine-resistant or -intolerant FMF patients. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to provide qualitative and quantitative evidence for the efficacy and safety of anti-IL-1 agents in adult and paediatric FMF patients.

Methods

MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL and Web of Science were screened from inception to May 2023. We included adult and paediatric FMF patients who received continuous treatment with at least one of the anti-IL-1 drugs: anakinra, canakinumab and rilonacept. The primary efficacy outcome was the proportion of patients who achieved complete remission of attacks and the primary safety outcome was the proportion of patients who experienced at least one adverse event during treatment. A random-effects meta-analysis was performed for the quantitative synthesis.

Results

Fourty-four reports consisting of 1399 FMF patients were included. Sixty percent (95% CI 49%, 72%) of the adult patients and 81% (95% CI 72%, 89%) of the paediatric patients achieved complete remission. Anti-IL-1 agents significantly decreased levels of inflammatory markers. At least one adverse event was observed in 25% (95% CI 13%, 37%) of the adult patients and 12% (95% CI 3%, 21%) of the paediatric patients.

Conclusion

Anti-IL-1 agents were effective and demonstrated a low adverse event profile in paediatric and adult FMF patients.

### Unravelling the clinical heterogeneity of undefined recurrent fever over time in the European registries on autoinflammation [^113dN6zX]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

The re-evaluation of the patients enrolled in the three registries as PFAPA and undefined recurrent fever according to the available PFAPA clinical criteria or case definition for SURF prompted rather heterogeneous results. In routine clinical practice, the diagnosis of PFAPA is based on summary of clinical judgements – with stereotypical attacks and prompt steroid response. Conversely uSAID/SURF should be defined by the absence of clinical manifestation typical for PFAPA in the absence of pathogenic mutations for genes associated with inherited recurrent fever, display a good response to colchicine treatment. Globally up to 67% of patients enrolled as PFAPA fulfilled at least one PFAPA criteria only and up to 77% patients enrolled as undefined recurrent fever fulfilled the preliminary case definition for SURF only. Conversely, up to 17% of PFAPA and up to 37% of patients enrolled as undefined recurrent fever patients fulfilled at least one criteria associated to the alternative condition. Finally, up to 19% of PFAPA and 35% of SURF patients did not fulfil any clinical criteria.

The heterogeneity observed among patients diagnosed with PFAPA and SURF in the registries underscores the need for further evaluation and differentiation within these groups. This diversity in clinical presentation raises concerns regarding the potential for misdiagnosis and highlights the importance of refining diagnostic criteria to better characterize these conditions. The phenotypic heterogeneity observed in our study suggests that the current diagnostic labels may not fully capture the spectrum of presentations seen in patients with recurrent fever syndromes. As such, there is a pressing need for more precise classification criteria that can accurately distinguish between different subtypes of autoinflammatory diseases. This study clearly shows the existence of a large gray zone of overlap between these two conditions, at least looking into the retrospective data of three large international registries.

Our study has several limitations that should be acknowledged. Firstly, most of the patients were enrolled in the registries before the development and the publication of the evidence-based Eurofever PFAPA criteria and the proposed case definition for SURF. This issue clearly explains the high phenotypic variability observed in the study, since the patients were enrolled in the registries according to the clinical diagnosis proposed by the enrolling centres. It should also be noted that the proposed case definition for SURF by PAPA et al. was not developed with an evidence-based approach comparing different conditions but simply derived from the critical revision of the literature. Additionally, the lack of prospective follow-up data limits our ability to draw definitive conclusions regarding therapeutic response and long-term outcomes.

Introduction: PFAPA syndrome is the most common periodic fever disorder in children, characterized by recurrent episodes of fever associated with cervical adenitis, pharyngitis, and aphthous stomatitis. Growing evidence suggests a connection between PFAPA and Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF), with both having associations with IL-1β pathways. Colchicine, a standard treatment for FMF, may potentially benefit PFAPA patients, but limited evidence exists on its efficacy for preventing recurrent PFAPA episodes.

Objectives: To evaluate the efficacy of colchicine prophylaxis in children diagnosed with PFAPA syndrome by comparing attack frequency in colchicine-treated patients versus standard care controls.

Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of 55 PFAPA patients (15 in the colchicine group and 40 in the control group). Demographics, clinical characteristics, FMF genetic profiles, and attack frequency before and after intervention were collected. The primary outcome was the time interval between fever episodes. Statistical significance was set at P < 0.05.

### Long-term antibiotic prophylaxis for prevention of rheumatic fever recurrence and progression to rheumatic heart disease [^113a2ZQe]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Rheumatic fever is a non-suppurative, inflammatory sequela of group A Streptococcus pharyngitis that can occur at two to four weeks after infection. Following an episode of rheumatic fever, there is a risk of developing rheumatic heart disease (RHD) later in life that carries significant risk of morbidity and mortality. RHD remains the largest global cause of cardiovascular disease in the young (age < 25 years). The historical literature provides inconclusive evidence that antibiotic prophylaxis is beneficial in reducing the risk of recurrence of rheumatic fever and development of RHD. Antibiotics are thought to work by reducing the carriage of group A Streptococcus and thus reducing the risk of infection. This review was commissioned by the World Health Organization (WHO) for an upcoming guideline.

Objectives

1. To assess the effects of long-term antibiotics versus no antibiotics (control) for secondary prevention of rheumatic fever recurrence and associated sequelae in people with previous rheumatic fever or RHD. 2. To assess the effects of long-term intramuscular penicillin versus long-term oral antibiotics for secondary prevention of rheumatic fever recurrence and associated sequelae in people with previous rheumatic fever or RHD.

Search Methods

We systematically searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Conference Proceedings Citation Index-Science, clinical trial registers, ISRCTN.com and reference lists without restrictions on language or date up to 10 March 2024.

Selection Criteria

We sought randomised controlled trials or quasi-randomised trials, described in any language, including participants with previous rheumatic fever and/or RHD of any age, based in community or hospital settings. Studies were included if they compared firstly antibiotic prophylaxis with no antibiotic prophylaxis, and, secondly, intramuscular penicillin prophylaxis versus oral antibiotic prophylaxis.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standardised methodological, Cochrane-endorsed procedures and performed meta-analyses with risk ratios (RR) and Peto odds ratios (Peto OR). Our primary outcomes were recurrence of rheumatic fever, progression or severity of RHD and cardiac complications. Our secondary outcomes were obstetric complications (maternal and foetal events), mortality, treatment adherence, adverse events and acceptability to participants. We performed comprehensive assessments of risk of bias and certainty of evidence, applying the GRADE methodology.

Main Results

We included 11 studies (seven RCTs and four quasi-randomised trials) including 3951 participants. The majority of the included studies were conducted in the USA, UK and Canada during the 1950s to 1960s. Most participants with previous rheumatic fever had been diagnosed using the modified Jones criteria (mJC) (four studies), were an average of 12.3 years of age and 50.6% male. We assessed the majority of the included studies to be at high risk of bias, predominantly relating to blinding and attrition bias. Comparison one: antibiotics versus no antibiotics Pooled meta-analysis of six RCTs provides moderate-certainty evidence that antibiotics overall (oral or intramuscular) probably reduce the risk of recurrence of rheumatic fever substantially (0.7% versus 1.7%, respectively) (risk ratio (RR) 0.39, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.22 to 0.69; 1721 participants). People with early or mild RHD likely have the greatest capacity to benefit from intramuscular antibiotic prophylaxis (8.1%) compared to no antibiotics (0.7%) (RR 0.09, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.29; 1 study, 818 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Antibiotics may not affect mortality in people with late-stage RHD (RR 1.23, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.94; 1 study, 994 participants; low-certainty evidence). Antibiotics may not affect the risk of anaphylaxis (Peto odds ratio (OR) 7.39, 95% CI 0.15 to 372; 1 study, 818 participants; low-certainty evidence) or sciatic nerve injury (Peto OR 7.39, 95% CI 0.15 to 372; 1 study, 818 participants; low-certainty evidence) compared with no antibiotics, but probably have an increased risk of hypersensitivity reactions (RR 137, 8.51 to 2210; 2 studies, 894 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) and local reactions (RR 29, 1.74 to 485; 1 study, 818 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Comparison two: intramuscular antibiotics versus oral antibiotics Pooled analysis of two RCTs showed that prophylactic intramuscular benzathine benzylpenicillin likely reduces recurrence of rheumatic fever substantially when compared to oral antibiotics (0.1% versus 1%, respectively) (RR 0.07, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.26; 395 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Furthermore, it is unclear whether intramuscular benzyl penicillin is superior to oral antibiotics in reducing the risk of mortality in the context of RHD (Peto OR 0.22, 95% CI 0.01 to 4.12; 1 study, 431 participants; very low-certainty evidence). There were no data available on progression of latent RHD or adverse events including anaphylaxis, sciatic nerve injury, delayed hypersensitivity/allergic reactions and local reactions to injection.

Authors' Conclusions

This review provides evidence that antibiotic prophylaxis likely reduces the risk of recurrence of rheumatic fever compared to no antibiotics, and that intramuscular benzathine benzylpenicillin is probably superior to oral antibiotics (approximately 10 times better). Moreover, intramuscular benzathine benzylpenicillin likely reduces the risk of progression of latent RHD. Evidence is scarce, but antibiotics compared with no antibiotics may not affect the risk of anaphylaxis or sciatic nerve injury, but probably carry an increased risk of hypersensitivity reactions and local reactions. Antibiotics may not affect all-cause mortality in late-stage RHD compared to no antibiotics. There is no evidence available to comment on the effect of intramuscular penicillin over oral antibiotics for progression of latent RHD and adverse events, and little evidence for all-cause mortality. It is important to interpret these findings in the context of major limitations, including the following: the vast majority of the included studies were conducted more than 50 years ago, many before contemporary echocardiographic studies; methodology was often at high risk of bias; outdated treatments were used; only one study was in latent RHD; and there are concerns regarding generalisability to low socioeconomic regions. This underlines the need for ongoing research to understand who benefits most from prophylaxis.

### Dysregulation of innate immunity: hereditary periodic fever syndromes [^11172hxq]. British Journal of Haematology (2009). Low credibility.

The hereditary periodic fever syndromes encompass a rare group of diseases that have lifelong recurrent episodes of inflammatory symptoms and an acute phase response in common. Clinical presentation can mimic that of lymphoproliferative disorders and patients often go undiagnosed for many years. These syndromes follow an autosomal inheritance pattern, and the major syndromes are linked to specific genes, most of which are involved in regulation of the innate immune response through pathways of apoptosis, nuclear factor kappaBeta activation and cytokine production. In others, the link between the protein involved and inflammation is less clear. The recurrent inflammation can lead to complications, such as renal impairment due to amyloidosis and vasculitis, visual impairment, hearing loss, and joint destruction, depending on the specific syndrome. In recent years, treatment options for these diseases have improved significantly. Early establishment of an accurate diagnosis and start of appropriate therapy improves prognosis in these patients.

### PFAPA syndrome: a review on treatment and outcome [^116tPAye]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Due to the small size of the samples, Aviel and Dusser didn't find variables that could predict responsiveness to colchicine. Because of the good response of FMF to colchicine, PFAPA patients heterozygous for MEFV mutations may respond better to this drug, but differences in the response to colchicine between carriers and non-carriers of the MEFV mutation have not been demonstrated so far.

Colchicine is usually well tolerated. The most common adverse reactions to colchicine are gastrointestinal (approximately 10%). This effect may be partially explained by induction or worsening of lactose intolerance by this medication, though multiple mechanism may be responsible.

These findings suggest that colchicine may be an effective second line treatment to prevent frequently recurrent fever episodes in PFAPA patients, in particular if prednisone is decreases the interval between episodes.
