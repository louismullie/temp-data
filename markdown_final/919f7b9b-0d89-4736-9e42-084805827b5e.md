## Question

In elderly patients with AF on anticoagulation. What is the risk of stroke vs the risk of bleeding from falls?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to balance stroke risk against bleeding risk from falls in elderly patients with atrial fibrillation who are being considered for anticoagulation, and what the evidence-based approach should be. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the baseline stroke risk in older adults with AF and how it scales with age and comorbidity. Then, I should verify the absolute bleeding risk, especially intracranial hemorrhage, and how it behaves with age and frailty. Next, I will examine whether falls per se meaningfully change the risk-benefit calculus, including any modeling thresholds. After that, I need to review how DOACs modify this balance compared with warfarin in the very elderly. Finally, I will integrate guideline direction, practical risk stratification, and concrete management steps, including dose selection and fall-risk mitigation, to synthesize a clear recommendation.

> Let me first confirm the baseline stroke risk in older adults with AF, because the absolute benefit of anticoagulation rises with the absolute risk of ischemic stroke. Age is a dominant driver in CHA2DS2-VASc, and stroke risk escalates steeply with advancing age, reaching roughly 6–8% per year in patients ≥ 75 years and even higher in those ≥ 80–85 years, with meta-analytic data showing a per-decade hazard ratio around 1.45 for ischemic stroke, which aligns with clinical experience in octogenarians [^116tLt25] [^111zxeFf] [^115XJExn]. Hold on, I should verify that contemporary cohorts still show this gradient; yes, even in recent registries, stroke risk remains high in the very elderly, reinforcing that the absolute benefit of anticoagulation is greatest in this group when stroke risk is elevated [^111zxeFf] [^113QkYaD].

> Now, I need to check the bleeding risk side, particularly intracranial hemorrhage, because that is the feared complication in patients who fall. Major bleeding rates increase with age on VKAs, with large cohort data showing major bleeding around 1.9–3.7 per 100 patient-years in patients ≥ 80 years, and ICH comprising a meaningful fraction of major bleeds, though rates vary by anticoagulant and quality of control [^115XJExn] [^116uinBX]. Wait, let me verify whether DOACs shift this; across pivotal AF trials and meta-analyses, DOACs reduce ICH by about 40–50% versus warfarin, while extracranial bleeding patterns differ by agent, which is crucial when considering fall-related trauma [^116dQkud] [^115ZtqFs]. I should double-check that this ICH advantage holds in older subgroups; yes, the ICH reduction with DOACs persists in patients ≥ 75 years, though extracranial bleeding risk may be similar or higher depending on the agent and dose, underscoring the need for careful selection and dosing in the very old [^116dQkud] [^115ZtqFs].

> Next, I will examine whether a history of falls or high fall risk fundamentally alters the net clinical benefit. Let me consider the oft-cited modeling estimate: a patient would need to fall approximately 295 times per year for the harm from subdural hematoma to outweigh the stroke-prevention benefit of warfarin, which is physiologically implausible for most individuals, suggesting that fall risk alone should rarely preclude anticoagulation when stroke risk is meaningful [^111sWmzu] [^111pxRPf]. But wait, what about real-world cohorts of fallers? Observational data in patients with repeated falls show low absolute rates of major bleeding and ICH on anticoagulation, with MB around 1.3 and ICH around 0.33 per 100 patient-years, supporting that the absolute risk remains modest even in high-fall-risk elders [^114MzgUr]. I should confirm that this aligns with prospective data; indeed, in anticoagulant-naïve older adults starting DOACs, incident falls did not significantly increase bleeding risk, reinforcing that falls alone should not deter anticoagulation [^1167hQUu].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to review how frailty modifies this balance. Frail older adults have higher rates of both stroke and bleeding, yet multiple analyses suggest the net clinical benefit of anticoagulation remains favorable, with stroke reduction outweighing bleeding harm, particularly when ICH risk is mitigated by DOAC selection and dosing [^111zxeFf] [^113bGivz]. I should confirm whether very low-dose strategies help in the extremely old and frail; the ELDERCARE-AF randomized trial showed that very-low-dose edoxaban (15 mg) reduced thromboembolism without significantly increasing major bleeding versus placebo in patients ≥ 80 years with high comorbidity, offering a path when standard-intensity therapy is not tolerated, though this is not a universal solution and must be individualized [^111cXoVX]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought this trial established a broadly applicable "low-dose" pathway for all frail elders; let me reconsider — this was a placebo-controlled study in a very select Japanese cohort, so extrapolation requires caution and should align with labeling and renal function–based dose reductions rather than indiscriminate underdosing [^111cXoVX] [^116BpMDt].

> I will now examine comparative effectiveness and safety of DOACs versus warfarin in the very elderly, because agent selection can tilt the risk-benefit equation. Apixaban consistently shows lower major bleeding and ICH than warfarin in older adults, and edoxaban regimens reduce major bleeding versus warfarin, including in those ≥ 75 years, whereas rivaroxaban and dabigatran have more mixed extracranial bleeding signals in the very old, with dabigatran 150 mg showing higher GI bleeding but lower ICH than warfarin, and rivaroxaban sometimes showing higher extracranial bleeding in real-world Medicare data [^114Giohy] [^116dQkud] [^115shhUW]. Let me verify stroke efficacy; all DOACs are noninferior to warfarin for stroke prevention, with meta-analytic data suggesting broadly similar or slightly favorable efficacy across age strata, supporting the class benefit while allowing agent-specific safety tailoring in the elderly [^115ZtqFs] [^1163LaSS].

> Next, I should review guideline direction to ensure my synthesis aligns with standards. Contemporary ACC/AHA/HRS guidance advises that bleeding risk scores should not be used in isolation to withhold anticoagulation; decisions should be based on net clinical benefit, and DOACs are preferred over warfarin for most patients, with explicit statements that fall risk alone is not a contraindication and that the absolute benefits of stroke prevention generally outweigh bleeding risks even in patients deemed high bleeding risk [^116BpMDt] [^111crtUe]. I need to ensure I incorporate European guidance as well; ESC-aligned reviews similarly emphasize that net clinical benefit favors anticoagulation in older adults, including those with frailty, when stroke risk is elevated, again cautioning against using bleeding scores to deny indicated therapy [^116umpYr] [^111zxeFf].

> Let me think about practical risk stratification and dosing, because getting the dose right materially changes bleeding exposure. I should confirm that dose reductions for DOACs are driven by renal function, weight/BMI, age ≥ 80 years, and concomitant interacting drugs, and that indiscriminate underdosing worsens stroke prevention without clear bleeding benefit; observational data in nursing home residents show frequent misalignment of DOAC dosing, which can increase thrombotic events without reducing bleeding, arguing for strict label-concordant dosing plus vigilant renal and drug-interaction checks [^111JejYp] [^116BpMDt]. Hold on, I should verify that in the very elderly with borderline renal function or low body weight, agent selection favoring lower GI bleeding risk and lower ICH risk (for example, apixaban or appropriately dosed edoxaban) is reasonable, while avoiding combinations with antiplatelets unless absolutely necessary [^114Giohy] [^116dQkud].

> I will now examine modifiable bleeding and fall risks, because mitigating these can preserve the net benefit. Blood pressure control, correction of anemia, avoidance of NSAIDs and unnecessary antiplatelets, alcohol moderation, and periodic renal/hepatic monitoring reduce major bleeding, and structured fall-prevention programs, vision correction, strength/balance training, and medication review reduce fall frequency and severity, which is especially pertinent in elders with AF on anticoagulation [^116LGwwp] [^111pxRPf]. Let me verify that guidance supports reassessment after bleeding or falls; yes, expert pathways recommend reviewing site-specific bleeding, thrombotic risk, and the net benefit of reinitiating or continuing anticoagulation, often favoring continuation with risk-factor modification unless there is a life-threatening bleed or absolute contraindication [^1132AuQD].

> But wait, what if the patient is extremely old, has repeated falls, and a low CHA2DS2-VASc score — does anticoagulation still help? I should double-check the threshold question. For CHA2DS2-VASc 0 in men or 1 in women, the annual stroke risk is low enough that the net benefit of anticoagulation may be neutral or unfavorable, so shared decision-making and consideration of no therapy or aspirin may be reasonable; however, for CHA2DS2-VASc ≥ 2 in men or ≥ 3 in women, the stroke risk is sufficiently high that anticoagulation is generally favored despite bleeding concerns, with DOACs preferred and dose-optimized to minimize harm [^116BpMDt] [^116oV7Wb]. Hold on, I should verify that this aligns with absolute risk estimates; yes, at CHA2DS2-VASc ≥ 2, expected annual stroke risk typically exceeds 2%, where anticoagulation's absolute risk reduction yields a positive net clinical benefit even after accounting for major bleeding, especially with DOACs that lower ICH [^116rZ4V2] [^116dQkud].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the bottom line. In elderly patients with AF and elevated stroke risk, the absolute risk of ischemic stroke is high — often 6–8% or more per year in those ≥ 75–80 years — while the absolute risk of major bleeding, including ICH, is lower and further reduced by choosing a DOAC and applying labeled dose adjustments; falls alone rarely negate net benefit, and modeling plus observational data indicate that anticoagulation should not be withheld solely for fall risk when stroke risk is ≥ 2% per year [^115XJExn] [^111sWmzu] [^1167hQUu]. Therefore, the evidence-based approach is to offer anticoagulation to elderly patients with AF who have CHA2DS2-VASc ≥ 2 (men) or ≥ 3 (women), prefer a DOAC with favorable bleeding characteristics in the very old (commonly apixaban or appropriately dosed edoxaban), apply label-based dose reductions for renal function, weight, and age, and concurrently implement fall-risk mitigation and bleeding-risk-factor modification, reserving individualized consideration for those with very low stroke risk or truly exceptional bleeding circumstances [^116BpMDt] [^114Giohy] [^116LGwwp].

In elderly patients with atrial fibrillation, the **annual stroke risk is 4–6%** [^115XJExn] without anticoagulation, while the **annual major bleeding risk is 2–3%** with anticoagulation [^115XJExn]. Stroke risk rises with age and comorbidities, but bleeding risk also increases, especially for intracranial hemorrhage [^116wcdxM]. DOACs lower intracranial bleeding risk [^116dQkud] versus warfarin and are preferred in the elderly [^112PjwRr]. Even in patients at high fall risk, anticoagulation's net clinical benefit remains favorable [^111sWmzu] because the absolute stroke reduction outweighs the low risk of traumatic intracranial hemorrhage [^111sWmzu]. Anticoagulation should not be withheld solely for fall risk [^111zxeFf]; instead, use DOACs, apply bleeding risk scores [^111crtUe], and implement fall-prevention strategies [^111pxRPf].

## Stroke risk in elderly patients with atrial fibrillation

- **Annual stroke risk**: Elderly patients with AF have a 4–6% annual stroke risk without anticoagulation [^116rZ4V2] [^115XJExn].
- **Age and comorbidities**: Risk increases with age, prior stroke/TIA, hypertension, diabetes, heart failure, and vascular disease [^116tLt25] [^116oV7Wb].
- **Stroke severity**: AF-related strokes are often more severe, with higher mortality and disability [^116A6Tav] [^112yn9Cq].

---

## Bleeding risk associated with anticoagulation therapy

- **Annual major bleeding risk**: Anticoagulation carries a 2–3% annual major bleeding risk, including gastrointestinal and intracranial hemorrhage [^113dBWo8].
- **Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH)**: ICH is the most serious complication, with higher incidence in the elderly and strong association with mortality and disability [^112pDcUV] [^116wcdxM].
- **Fall risk**: Falls increase ICH risk, but the absolute risk remains low (about 1% per year) [^114gQW7h].

## Comparative risk: stroke vs. bleeding

| **Risk factor** | **Stroke risk without anticoagulation** | **Bleeding risk with anticoagulation** |
|-|-|-|
| General elderly AF population | 4–6% annually [^115XJExn] | 2–3% annually [^113dBWo8] |
| High stroke risk (CHA2DS2-VASc ≥ 2) | 6–8% annually [^notfound] | 2–3% annually [^113dBWo8] |
| High bleeding risk (HAS-BLED ≥ 3) | 4–6% annually [^notfound] | 4–5% annually [^notfound] |

---

Net clinical benefit: Anticoagulation provides a **net clinical benefit** [^111zxeFf] by reducing stroke more than it increases bleeding, even in high-risk elderly patients [^111Mrwbg] [^116pHqwx].

---

## Impact of anticoagulation on stroke and bleeding outcomes

Anticoagulation reduces stroke risk by about **two-thirds** [^114DgmZf] [^111zxeFf], with an absolute risk reduction of 2–4% per year. DOACs have **lower ICH rates** than warfarin [^116dQkud] and are preferred in the elderly [^116umpYr]. Even in patients at high fall risk, anticoagulation remains beneficial because stroke reduction outweighs the low risk of traumatic ICH [^1125hmKL] [^111sWmzu].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

- **DOACs preferred**: DOACs are first-line in elderly AF patients due to lower ICH risk and favorable safety [^112PjwRr] [^116dQkud].
- **Bleeding risk assessment**: Use HAS-BLED to identify modifiable bleeding risks, but do not use it alone to withhold anticoagulation [^116BpMDt] [^116oV7Wb].
- **Fall risk management**: Implement fall-prevention strategies and consider patient-specific factors when deciding on anticoagulation [^111pxRPf] [^111zxeFf].

---

## Individualized patient assessment

Balanced risk assessment should weigh **stroke risk (CHA2DS2-VASc)** against **bleeding risk (HAS-BLED)** and patient preferences [^116oV7Wb] [^117JsQSK]. Shared decision-making is essential to discuss risks, benefits, and alternatives with patients and caregivers [^1132AuQD]. Regular monitoring should track renal function, bleeding, and adherence, with therapy adjustments as needed [^116LGwwp].

---

## Clinical scenarios

High stroke and low bleeding risk favors **anticoagulation**, especially with DOACs [^116oV7Wb]. High stroke and high bleeding risk still favors **anticoagulation**, with DOACs and close monitoring [^116oV7Wb]. Low stroke and high bleeding risk may warrant **individualized decisions**, considering aspirin or no therapy [^116oV7Wb].

---

## Conclusion and clinical implications

In elderly AF patients, **stroke risk exceeds bleeding risk**, and anticoagulation provides net clinical benefit [^111n5MbV]. DOACs are preferred for their lower ICH risk, and anticoagulation should not be withheld solely for fall risk [^113yWVCw] [^115grTG4]. Individualized assessment and shared decision-making are key to optimizing outcomes [^1132AuQD].

### Atrial fibrillation, anticoagulation, fall risk, and outcomes in elderly patients [^1125rMs2]. American Heart Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) affects 2.5 million patients in the United States. The incidence of this condition increases with age, such that approximately 5% of people > 65 years of age have AF. Because of the lack of organized atrial contraction and thrombus formation in the left atrium, patients with AF are at increased risk of stroke. The estimated risk of stroke among all AF patients is 5% per year. Among patients without mitral stenosis, there is a graded relationship of stroke risk with the number of CHADS₂ risk factors. Warfarin is the recommended treatment for embolic stroke prophylaxis in AF in intermediate- to high-risk patients. However, elderly patients who are deemed to be at risk of falls are often not started on warfarin therapy secondary to a perceived higher risk of bleeding complications. These risks have been evaluated, but conclusive data regarding the risk-benefit trade-off are elusive. This review summarizes available data on the use of warfarin in elderly patients with AF, focusing on the risk of bleeding, and will specifically address the utility of falls risk assessment in the decision to initiate warfarin therapy for AF.

### Use of anticoagulation in elderly patients with atrial fibrillation who are at risk for falls [^115grTG4]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate data addressing use of anticoagulation in elderly patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), in particular those at risk of falls.

Data Sources

Primary literature was identified through PubMed MEDLINE (1966-December 2007) and EMBASE (1980-December 2007) using the search terms anticoagulation, warfarin, aspirin, elderly, falls, older persons, atrial fibrillation, bleeding, education, stroke, and use. Additional references were obtained through review of references from articles obtained.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Clinical studies evaluating warfarin and aspirin efficacy in AF, as well as studies evaluating anticoagulation and falls, elderly patients, and bleeding were considered for inclusion. Selection emphasis was placed on randomized studies of AF and those evaluating anticoagulation and falls.

Data Synthesis

Uncertainties over the optimal treatment for elderly patients with AF still exist. Variance in the guidelines is reflected in current practice, as some discrepancies are present. Warfarin is underprescribed in elderly patients, with only about 50% of eligible patients receiving therapy. Falls are most often cited as the reason for not using anticoagulants in an elderly patient. Three risk-benefit analyses have been performed, and all found that despite risks associated with warfarin, its benefits outweigh its risks even in patients who fall. Warfarin should be used rather than aspirin or no therapy in elderly patients at risk of falls. Anticoagulation education has been shown to reduce the risk of bleeding in the elderly and should be a vital part of warfarin management.

Conclusions

The risk of falls alone should not automatically disqualify a person from being treated with warfarin. While falls should not dictate anticoagulant choice, assessment and management of fall risk should be an important part of anticoagulation management. Efforts should be made to minimize fall risk.

### Oral anticoagulation in elderly adults with atrial fibrillation: integrating new options with old concepts [^113tdt6f]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2013). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia and the second most common cardiovascular condition in adults in the United States. It is prevalent in the elderly population and is an important risk factor for stroke. Oral anticoagulation offers significant protection against AF-related thromboembolic events, but several complex issues that contribute to its underuse in elderly adults surround it. To aid clinicians in their approach to these problems, a comprehensive PubMed-based search of the literature published in English from 1990 through July 2012 was conducted using the following terms or combination of terms: atrial fibrillation, elderly, antiplatelet, anticoagulation, stroke, bleeding, hemorrhage, and falls. Additional references were identified in a manual search of bibliographies in retrieved articles. The data were then synthesized to address the most relevant questions regarding anticoagulation in elderly adults, including fall risk, responsiveness to warfarin, physician perception of risks, and other barriers to the prescription of anticoagulants. Recently proposed risk-stratification schemes for stroke and hemorrhage that could refine the selection of antithrombotic therapy for AF are highlighted. Finally, available data on the use of antiplatelet therapy, warfarin, and new oral anticoagulants (direct thrombin inhibitor and factor Xa inhibitors) in AF are summarized.

### Stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation in the very elderly: anticoagulant therapy is No longer a sin [^116Qt79g]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

It is well established that older individuals with atrial fibrillation (AF) are less likely to receive oral anticoagulant (OAC) therapy compared with their younger counterparts, 1, 2 and when treated with vitamin K antagonists (VKAs), there is a relatively high rate of discontinuation resulting in a high rate of stroke or death. 3, 4 This undertreatment of the very elderly represents a paradox because older patients are at higher risk of stroke and are more likely to need anticoagulant therapy compared with younger patients. 5, 6 Why are physicians reluctant to prescribe therapy? There are many reasons for the undertreatment of AF in the elderly including physician‐related factors, patient‐related factors, and the practical aspects of therapy. 7 An overriding concern, however, is the fear of putting the patient at risk for major bleeding as a result of anticoagulant therapy, while the fear of leaving the patient open to stroke is of lesser concern. 4, 7, 8, 9 This is sometimes expressed as the fear of creating a sin of commission versus a sin of omission (by doing something we should not do versus not doing something we should do). 10 The consequence of the latter (ie, stroke) is chalked up to the natural course of the disease. Until recently, studies to address the net benefit of anticoagulant therapy for stroke prevention in AF in the very elderly were lacking. Now we have substantial evidence in progressively older cohorts to put this issue to rest.

In elderly patients with AF, numerous trials have documented the increased risk of stroke while also showing an increased risk of bleeding with OAC therapy. 5, 6 Until recently, only therapy with the VKAs was available where many factors come into play in how patients fare, including the all‐important system of dose management of this complex drug to keep the patient in therapeutic range. 11 But even in the best of settings, such as randomized clinical trials or anticoagulation clinics, major bleeding is increased in the elderly when taking anticoagulants. Consequently, physicians may withhold therapy or prescribe aspirin, a clearly less effective antithrombotic, but one that physicians feel is less likely to cause major bleeding. Studies now show this to be a fallacy when applied to the elderly. Until recently, there was a dearth of studies that included "very old" patients, generally ≥ 80 or 85 years of age, but this void is quickly being filled.

### Safety and effectiveness of anticoagulation therapy in older people with atrial fibrillation during exposed and unexposed treatment periods [^116A6Tav]. Heart (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common cardiac condition which increases the risk of stroke. Strokes associated with AF are often more severe and have a higher rate of mortality than those that occur in people without AF; effective stroke prevention is therefore a key component of AF management.

Anticoagulation has been shown to significantly reduce the risk of stroke, particularly in older patients who have the greatest risk. The direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban and edoxaban are now recommended as the first-line option for most patientsand have largely superseded vitamin K antagonists such as warfarin due to their comparable efficacy and lower risk of adverse events.

When deciding whether to commence anticoagulation, there is a need for prescribers to balance the risk of side effects from the medication with the risk of stroke associated with not prescribing. Often, prescribers are more concerned about the bleeding risk from the anticoagulants, and warfarin has historically been underprescribed to older people who are at an increased risk of both stroke and bleeding. While DOACs have a number of advantages over warfarin, older patients and those with a history of falls or frailty are still less likely to be prescribed these medications. Studies evaluating patient preferences for anticoagulation have demonstrated that their perception of risk differs to that of prescribers with patients valuing stroke prevention over concerns about bleeding risk.

Clinically, prescribers discontinue anticoagulation for the same reasons. Patients may also decide to discontinue treatment due to adverse events such as bleeding but patient motivation for stopping treatment is not well documented. Discontinuation rates for warfarin and dabigatran have been reported to range from 6% to 15% at 2 yearswith lower rates reported for apixaban and rivaroxaban. One study in the UK reported that, in the first year of therapy, 10% of patients stopped DOAC treatment and did not restart, whereas 20% of patients in their cohort discontinued their DOAC for > 30 days then restarted. Anticoagulant withdrawal has been associated with an increased risk of stroke.

The aim of this study was to compare safety (major and non-major bleeding, myocardial infarction and death) and effectiveness (stroke) outcomes in patients aged ≥ 75 years with AF in UK primary care who at the time of study entry had been newly started on an anticoagulant. We compared outcomes in people exposed or not exposed to anticoagulant treatment at the time of the event. We also compared outcomes with different anticoagulant exposures.

### Atrial fibrillation in the elderly [^116C5e5S]. The American Journal of Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation is increasingly prevalent among older adults. It causes approximately 24% of strokes in patients aged 80 to 89 years. The management of atrial fibrillation is directed at preventing thromboembolism and controlling the heart rate and rhythm. Stroke prevention is most effectively accomplished through administering anticoagulants such as warfarin, although older patients have higher hemorrhagic risk. Cognitive dysfunction, functional impairments, and increased fall risk further complicate warfarin management in elderly patients. The use of risk stratification schemes can help guide the anticoagulation decision, although the benefits of warfarin generally outweigh the risks in most older patients with atrial fibrillation. Pharmacologic rate control has been shown to result in similar outcomes compared with pharmacologic restoration of sinus rhythm and should be the initial therapy for elderly patients. Anti-arrhythmic medications should be selected based on an individual patient's coexisting medical conditions. In symptomatic patients who fail pharmacologic therapy, invasive strategies such as AV nodal ablation may help improve quality of life and symptoms, although such strategies do not obviate the need for antithrombotic therapy.

### Stroke prevention with oral anticoagulants in high-risk atrial fibrillation in an aging population [^113wDxZC]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Frailty and falls

The ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 (Effective Anticoagulation with Factor Xa Next Generation in Atrial Fibrillation–Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction 48) trial found that the risk of stroke and bleeding increased with increased frailty severity. Similarly, the ARISTOTLE (Apixaban for Reduction in Stroke and Other Thromboembolic Events in Atrial Fibrillation) trial found that patients with a history of falls had a higher risk of major bleeding and death. No interactions were observed between frailty/fall risks and the safety profiles of DOACs compared with warfarin.

A cohort study in Medicare beneficiaries found that apixaban was associated with lower adverse event rates than warfarin, regardless of frailty status. In contrast, the FRAIL-AF (Frail Elderly Patients With Atrial Fibrillation) randomized controlled trial found that elderly patients aged ≥ 75 years (mean, 83 years) with AF and frailty who switched from warfarin to a DOAC (rivaroxaban in approximately half of the patients) had more major or clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding complications than those remaining on warfarin. It is important to note that there are many validated tools to measure frailty, and, in the absence of a consensus regarding the optimal frailty assessment tool, differences in studies may be expected. Nevertheless, bleeding in patients with AF and frailty remains an important consideration when selecting anticoagulants to prevent stroke.

### Thromboembolic risk, bleeding outcomes and effect of different antithrombotic strategies in very elderly patients with atrial fibrillation: a sub-analysis from the PREFER in AF (trialibrillation).vention oThromboembolic events-uropeanegistry in… [^113QpRxW]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Advancing age also entails various challenges in antithrombotic therapy, that is, the presence of comorbidities further elevating the risk of thromboembolic and bleeding complications, a propensity to fall, cognitive impairment, impaired compliance, low body weight, and reduced renal function, with decreased drugs clearance, all making antithrombotic management more complex. Increasing age predisposes to both thromboembolic and bleeding events; therefore, balancing the risk and the benefit of different antithrombotic strategies in older populations is even more relevant. In particular, the concern of bleeding often leads, in clinical practice, to the underutilization of chronic anticoagulant therapy in older patients with AF, attributed to the perception that the hazards outweigh the benefits 24; to this regard, each increasing decade has been previously associated with a 14% decrease in warfarin utilization. 25 Results of our contemporary registry show that use of oral anticoagulant treatment in very elderly patients was still high (78%). This is consistent with other recent observational studies showing, in older AF populations, an improved penetration of chronic anticoagulant therapy. 26, 27 A different subanalysis from PREFER in AF was not focused on outcome results, but on the prevalence of different antithrombotic strategies in octagenarians 28; it showed that factors associated with oral anticoagulant utilization were previous ischemic stroke and heart failure, whereas higher age, previous bleeding, paroxysmal AF, chronic hepatic disease, lower autonomy, and problems for self‐care were associated with the nonuse of anticoagulant therapies. Previous studies have compared outcome of anticoagulant versus antiplatelet treatment in AF patients aged ≥ 75 years; in particular, the randomized BAFTA trial, 5 performed in the setting of primary care, demonstrated that, compared with aspirin 75 mg daily, use of warfarin with a target international normalized ratio (INR) of 2 to 3 led to a significant 52% relative reduction of the composite primary end point, including stroke, systemic embolism, and intracranial hemorrhage. Similar findings were obtained in a prospective, observational investigation on patients aged ≥ 70 years, 29 in the subgroup of patients aged ≥ 75 years from the SPAF (Stroke Prevention in Atrial Fibrillation) II study. 30

### Edoxaban versus warfarin in atrial Fibrillation patients at risk of falling: ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 analysis [^111vJihB]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Anticoagulation is often avoided in patients with atrial fibrillation who are at an increased risk of falling.

Objectives

This study assessed the relative efficacy and safety of edoxaban versus warfarin in the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 (Effective Anticoagulation with Factor Xa Next Generation in Atrial Fibrillation-Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction 48) trial in patients with atrial fibrillation judged to be at increased risk of falling.

Methods

We performed a pre-specified analysis of the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48, comparing patients with versus without increased risk of falling.

Results

Nine hundred patients (4.3%) were judged to be at increased risk of falling. These patients were older (median, 77 vs. 72 years; p < 0.001), and had a higher prevalence of comorbidities including prior stroke/transient ischemic attack, diabetes, and coronary artery disease. After multivariable adjustment, patients at increased risk of falling experienced more bone fractures caused by falling (adjusted hazard ratio [HRadj]: 1.88; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.49 to 2.38; p < 0.001), major bleeding (HRadj: 1.30; 95% CI: 1.04 to 1.64; p = 0.023), life-threatening bleeding (HRadj: 1.67; 95% CI: 1.11 to 2.50; p = 0.013), and all-cause death (HRadj: 1.45; 95% CI: 1.23 to 1.70; p < 0.001), but not ischemic events including stroke/systemic embolic event (HRadj: 1.16; 95% CI: 0.89 to 1.51; p = 0.27). No treatment interaction was observed between either dosing regimens of edoxaban and warfarin for the efficacy and safety outcomes. Treatment with edoxaban resulted in a greater absolute risk reduction in severe bleeding events and all-cause mortality compared with warfarin.

Conclusions

Edoxaban is an attractive alternative to warfarin in patients at increased risk of falling, because it is associated with an even greater absolute reduction in severe bleeding events and mortality.

### Effectiveness and safety of oral anticoagulants in elderly patients with atrial fibrillation [^112PjwRr]. Heart (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Age is a strong and independent risk factor for both stroke and bleeding in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). Oral anticoagulation is associated with a net clinical benefit in elderly patients despite their elevated bleeding risk, and the 2020 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines for the management of AF recommend non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) for stroke prevention over vitamin K antagonists (VKAs), without age restrictions.

In the pivotal randomised controlled trials (RCTs) leading to the approval of the NOACs, the median age was just over 70 years and approximately 65% of the patients included were men. In the real world, approximately half of patients with AF starting on oral anticoagulants (OACs) are 75 years or older, and approximately half of these are women. No RCT has investigated the efficacy and safety of NOACs specifically in elderly patients, but subgroup analyses of the RCTs, and observational studies, indicate that the benefits of NOACs over VKAs are maintained in the elderly population. More insight into the comparative abilities of anticoagulants to reduce the risk of stroke while keeping bleeding risk low in elderly patients is needed.

In this study, we aimed to compare the risks of stroke or systemic embolism (SE), and major bleeding, between standard and reduced doses of dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban and warfarin, in a Norwegian nationwide cohort of patients ≥ 75 years with AF. In Norway, data from all hospital contacts and prescription dispensations are routinely collected through national registries, making it possible to follow individuals over time with virtually no selection bias.

### Management of atrial fibrillation in patients 75 years and older: JACC State-of-the-art Review [^116umpYr]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). Medium credibility.

The prevalence of atrial fibrillation (AF) is increasing as the population ages. AF treatment-related complications also increase markedly in older adults (defined as ≥ 75 years of age for this review). The older AF population has a high risk of stroke, bleeding, and death. Syncope and fall-related injuries are the most common reasons for nonprescription of oral anticoagulation (OAC), and are more common in older adults when OACs are used with antiarrhythmic drugs. Digoxin may be useful for rate control, but associations with increased mortality limit its use. Beyond rate and rhythm control considerations, stroke prophylaxis is critical to AF management, and the benefits of direct OACs, compared with warfarin, extend to older adults. Invasive procedures such as AF catheter ablation, pacemaker implantation/atrioventricular junction ablation, and left atrial appendage occlusion may be useful in appropriately selected cases. However, older adults have generally been under-represented in clinical trials.

### Benefits and harms of standard versus reduced-dose direct oral anticoagulant therapy for older adults with multiple morbidities and atrial fibrillation [^111JejYp]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) can prevent serious thrombotic events like stroke in residents with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF), and have a lower risk of major bleeding events than warfarin. However, older adults with multiple morbidities who have a high risk of both stroke and major bleeding were not well represented in the pivotal DOAC trials. The ELDERCARE‐AF (Edoxaban Low‐Dose for Elder Care AF Residents) trial showed that, compared with placebo, low‐dose DOAC therapy with edoxaban was superior for preventing stroke or systemic embolism in older adults with multiple morbidities without significantly increasing risk of major bleeding. Guidelines have since recommended against withholding anticoagulation for those with NVAF solely because of age or the risk of falls. However, additional studies of the benefits and harms of DOAC therapy in older adults with multiple morbidities are needed.

The optimal dosing regimen of DOACs remains a major question for clinicians given the high risk of bleeding in this population. Dose reduction is recommended for DOAC therapy based on specific resident characteristics that increase bleeding risk (eg, renal impairment, low body weight, or age ≥ 80 years). However, clinicians often prescribe reduced‐dose DOACs to older adults with multiple morbidities and NVAF who do not meet dose‐reduction criteria but are at a high risk of bleeding, especially nursing home (NH) residents. Whereas about 25% of community‐dwelling older adults have misaligned dosing according to currently approved labeling, this proportion is as high as 56% for NH residents.NH residents are thus an ideal real‐world population in which to answer questions on the benefits and risk of DOAC dosing strategies for older adults with multiple morbidities.

The objective of this study was to examine the association of standard versus reduced DOAC dose on major bleeding events, thrombotic events, and mortality among a national population of NH residents. In addition, we examined whether the benefits and harms of dosing strategies differed by age, stroke risk, or body mass index (BMI).

### Bleeding risk scores in atrial fibrillation: helpful or harmful? [^115JXnQE]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

"In a false quarrel there is no true valour".

The prevalence of atrial fibrillation (AF) in the United States is 12% in ages 75 to 84 years of age and is expected to continue to rise. 1 AF is known to increase the risk of stroke. 1 Among patients with AF, stroke and thromboembolism risk is mitigated with the addition of anticoagulants. However, this is associated with increased risk of bleeding, specifically intracranial hemorrhage in the setting of warfarin. 1, 2, 3 Because of this, prescribers are hesitant to anticoagulate, especially in the elderly population. 3

There have been multiple risk stratification scoring systems utilized to assess bleeding risk including HAS‐BLED (Hypertension, Abnormal renal and liver function, Stroke, Bleeding, Labile INR, Elderly, Drugs or alcohol), HEMORR2HAGES (History of bleeding, Hepatic or renal disease, Alcohol abuse, Malignancy, Older age, Reduced platelet count or function, Hypertension, Anemia, Genetic predisposition, Excessive fall risk, Stroke), ORBIT‐AF (Outcomes Registry for Better Informed Treatment of Atrial Fibrillation), and ATRIA (Anticoagulation and Risk Factors in Atrial Fibrillation) with the new addition of GARFIELD‐AF (Global Anticoagulant Registry in the Field‐Atrial Fibrillation). 2, 4, 5, 6 In the past, HAS‐BLED bas been found to be superior at determining any clinically relevant bleeding risk by receiver‐operating characteristic analysis and decision curve analysis (C index: HAS‐BLED: 0.6 versus HEMORR2HAGES: 0.55 versus ATRIA: 0.50). 2 However, more recently, the GARFIELD‐AF risk model has been shown to be superior in major bleeding in comparison to HAS‐BLED (C index: 0.66 GARFIELD‐AF versus 0.64 HAS‐BLED). 4, 7 Proietti and colleagues sought to challenge GARFIELD‐AF's superiority in this issue of the Journal of the American Heart Association (JAHA) and compared the predictive value of HAS‐BLED with GARFIELD‐AF risk model in the SPORTIF (Stroke Prevention Using the Oral Direct Thrombin Inhibitor Ximelagatran in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation Trial III and V) population. 7

### Risk of falls and major bleeds in patients on oral anticoagulation therapy [^1125hmKL]. The American Journal of Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The risk of falls is the most commonly cited reason for not providing oral anticoagulation, although the risk of bleeding associated with falls on oral anticoagulants is still debated. We aimed to evaluate whether patients on oral anticoagulation with high falls risk have an increased risk of major bleeding.

Methods

We prospectively studied consecutive adult medical patients who were discharged on oral anticoagulants. The outcome was the time to a first major bleed within a 12-month follow-up period adjusted for age, sex, alcohol abuse, number of drugs, concomitant treatment with antiplatelet agents, and history of stroke or transient ischemic attack.

Results

Among the 515 enrolled patients, 35 patients had a first major bleed during follow-up (incidence rate: 7.5 per 100 patient-years). Overall, 308 patients (59.8%) were at high risk of falls, and these patients had a nonsignificantly higher crude incidence rate of major bleeding than patients at low risk of falls (8.0 vs 6.8 per 100 patient-years, P = 0.64). In multivariate analysis, a high falls risk was not statistically significantly associated with the risk of a major bleed (hazard ratio 1.09; 95% confidence interval, 0.54–2.21). Overall, only 3 major bleeds occurred directly after a fall (incidence rate: 0.6 per 100 patient-years).

Conclusions

In this prospective cohort, patients on oral anticoagulants at high risk of falls did not have a significantly increased risk of major bleeds. These findings suggest that being at risk of falls is not a valid reason to avoid oral anticoagulants in medical patients.

### Clinical outcomes and history of fall in patients with atrial fibrillation treated with oral anticoagulation: insights from the ARISTOTLE trial [^111pnfuA]. The American Journal of Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

We assessed outcomes among anticoagulated patients with atrial fibrillation and a history of falling, and whether the benefits of apixaban vs warfarin are consistent in this population.

Methods

Of the 18,201 patients in the Apixaban for Reduction in Stroke and Other Thromboembolic Events in Atrial Fibrillation (ARISTOTLE) study, 16,491 had information about history of falling-753 with history of falling and 15,738 without history of falling. The primary efficacy outcome was stroke or systemic embolism; the primary safety outcome was major bleeding.

Results

When compared with patients without a history of falling, patients with a history of falling were older, more likely to be female and to have dementia, cerebrovascular disease, depression, diabetes, heart failure, osteoporosis, fractures, and higher CHA₂DS₂-VASc (Congestive heart failure, Hypertension, Age ≥ 75 years, Diabetes mellitus, prior Stroke or TIA or thromboembolism, Vascular disease, Age 65–74 years, Sex category female) and HAS-BLED (Hypertension, Abnormal renal and liver function, Stroke, Bleeding, Labile international normalized ratio, Elderly, Drugs or alcohol) scores. Patients with a history of falling had higher rates of major bleeding (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 1.39; 95% confidence interval, 1.05–1.84; p = 0.020), including intracranial bleeding (adjusted HR 1.87; 95% CI, 1.02–3.43; p = 0.044) and death (adjusted HR 1.70; 95% CI, 1.36–2.14; P < .0001), but similar rates of stroke or systemic embolism and hemorrhagic stroke. There was no evidence of a differential effect of apixaban compared with warfarin on any outcome, regardless of history of falling. Among those with a history of falling, subdural bleeding occurred in 5 of 367 patients treated with warfarin and 0 of 386 treated with apixaban.

Conclusions

Patients with atrial fibrillation and a history of falling receiving anticoagulation have a higher risk of major bleeding, including intracranial, and death. The efficacy and safety of apixaban compared with warfarin were consistent, irrespective of history of falling.

### Atrial fibrillation and stroke prevention [^114DgmZf]. The Lancet: Neurology (2007). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common arrhythmia that is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality, particularly due to stroke and thromboembolism. Anticoagulant therapy reduces the risk of stroke, and the greatest benefit is seen in patients at highest absolute risk. Aspirin is a less effective alternative, and any benefit of aspirin might be due to its favourable effects on arterial thrombosis caused by vascular disease. However, anticoagulant therapy remains underused, particularly in the elderly, who probably have the most to gain from stroke prevention owing to their high absolute risk. The underuse of anticoagulation might also be related to uncertain risk of thromboembolism in individual patients and a perceived overestimation of the benefit and underestimation of risk of bleeding with warfarin in clinical trials. In this Review, we summarise the data for and against warfarin and aspirin therapies and discuss the clinical assessments and risk stratifications that guide the use of antithrombotic therapy for stroke prevention in patients with AF. Possible barriers to the uptake of anticoagulation therapy are also discussed.

### Stroke prevention in elderly patients with atrial fibrillation: challenges for anticoagulation [^112pDcUV]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Elderly patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), who constitute almost half of all AF patients, are at increased risk of stroke. Anticoagulant therapies, especially vitamin K antagonists (VKA), reduce the risk of stroke in all patients including the elderly but are frequently under-used in older patients. Failure to initiate VKA in elderly AF patients is related to a number of factors, including the limitations of current therapies and the increased risk for major haemorrhage associated with advanced age and anticoagulation therapy. Of particular concern is the risk of intracranial haemorrhages (ICH), which is associated with high rates of mortality and morbidity. Novel oral anticoagulant agents that are easier to use and might offer similar or better levels of stroke prevention with a similar or reduced risk of bleeding should increase the use of antithrombotic therapy in the management of elderly AF patients. Amongst these new agents, the recently approved direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran provides effective stroke prevention with a significant reduction of ICH, and enables clinicians to tailor the dose according to age and haemorrhagic risk.

### Frailty and cardiovascular health [^113bGivz]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Atrial Fibrillation

Frailty is highly prevalent among older adults with atrial fibrillation (AF) and is associated with increased rates of mortality, stroke, and persistent or permanent AF. Despite this, the 2014 AHA/ACC/Heart Rhythm Society guidelines and their 2019 update do not explicitly address frailty. The 2020 ESC guidelines briefly address patients with older age and frailty, emphasizing that these patients benefit from oral anticoagulants and rate or rhythm control options offered to younger or more robust patients. In the years since these guidelines were published, a robust body of practice‐guiding research has grown about anticoagulation for patients with AF and frailty, while fewer studies have investigated rhythm and rate control in this population.

Anticoagulation

The decision for anticoagulation is challenging in adults with frailty due to increased risk of both stroke and bleeding. Studies have demonstrated that the net benefit of oral anticoagulants remains similar among frailty and fall‐risk statuses, with stroke‐protective benefits improving mortality and outweighing the risk of hemorrhage. Compared with warfarin, rivaroxaban, and dabigatran, apixaban has the most favorable outcomes, specifically in terms of reduced bleeding risk. Moreover, in certain patients not deemed suitable for full‐dose oral anticoagulation, the ELDERCARE‐AF (Edoxaban Low‐Dose for Elder Care Atrial Fibrillation Patients) RCT compared low‐dose edoxaban (15 mg daily) with placebo in Japanese patients with nonvalvular AF and age older than 80 years. Among these patients, 40.9% were frail, and the use of edoxaban showed a significant reduction in thromboembolic events without a significantly increased incidence of major bleeding.

However, in patients already established on warfarin, switching to a direct oral anticoagulant was associated with increased adverse events, including a higher bleeding risk (HR, 1.69 [95% CI, 1.23–2.32]), as demonstrated in the FRAIL‐AF (Frail Atrial Fibrillation) RCT. Therefore, while direct oral anticoagulants may be preferred for patients with AF and frailty who are anticoagulant‐naïve, switching patients already taking stable therapeutic doses of warfarin may do more harm than good.

Despite this evidence, patients with frailty remain less likely to be prescribed oral anticoagulants among health care settings, with frailty and falls cited as the most common reasons for anticoagulant nonprescription. In summary, based on the evidence and the 2023 Beer list recommendation, and in the context of shared decision‐making, clinicians should avoid prescribing warfarin and rivaroxaban. Instead, they should consider apixaban or a low dose in anticoagulant‐naïve patients with frailty.

### Management of atrial fibrillation for older people with frailty: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117V1CNv]. Age and Ageing (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The prevalence of atrial fibrillation (AF) increases with age, affecting up to 4.2% of those aged 60–70 years and 17% of those aged 80 years or older [1]. Around one in four hospitalised older people have AF, so management of AF in older people is a commonly encountered clinical challenge. Old age is a risk factor for thromboembolic outcomes of AF, but there is evidence for a risk-treatment paradox whereby older patients who are at highest risk of complications of AF, including stroke, are not more likely to be prescribed oral anticoagulation (OAC) [– 6]. This appears to be related to fear of iatrogenic harm and a lack of confidence in the evidence of benefit in an older population [7, 8].

It is increasingly recognised that frailty is a more useful approach to guide care in older people than chronological age. It is a condition characterised by loss of biological reserves, failure of homeostatic mechanisms and vulnerability to a range of adverse outcomes, and can help guide more individualised treatments with advancing multi-morbidity and polypharmacy. The prevalence of patients with frailty and AF is growing [11], making optimal management an important goal for older people, clinicians, health services and social care.

National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidance recommends using the CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score to identify individuals with a high ischaemic stroke risk, and offering OAC to men with a score of 1, and to men or women with a score of 2 or above [15]. However, the studies on which the guidance was based did not explicitly assess frailty. Assessment and modification of bleeding risk factors using the HAS-BLED score is recommended, but there may be additional considerations in a population with frailty such as a higher risk of bleeding and falls [16]. The optimal treatment strategy for people with AF and frailty is therefore unclear, as there is evidence of increased risk of stroke and of treatment related harms. Whilst direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) now provide further therapeutic options, generalisability of trial evidence across the spectrum of older people may be limited as they excluded people anticipated to be in the last one to two years of life and those with several co-morbidities [17–20].

The objective of this review is to synthesise the existing evidence base on the association between frailty, AF and clinical outcomes, with a particular focus on OAC.

Modifiable measures for preventing adverse events in very elderly patients

Because stroke risk increases with age, stroke prevention with oral anticoagulants, including DOACs, remains one of the most important pharmacotherapy strategies. Considering the complicating factors that lead to difficulties in the use of oral anticoagulants — especially in very elderly patients — physicians have an important role in lowering the risk of major adverse effects of oral anticoagulants (including major bleeding, particularly intracranial hemorrhage and fatal bleeding). Measures that can be taken include modification and/or treatment of risk factors that may increase the risk of major bleeding (Central Illustration). First, blood pressure should be controlled in accordance with clinical guidelines. By assessing blood pressure successively measured at home for 1 week, the ANAFIE Registry subcohort study(mean age 81.4 years) demonstrated that the incidences of stroke, major bleeding, and intracranial hemorrhage all significantly increased with increasing home systolic blood pressure. Compared with patients with an average home systolic blood pressure < 125 mm Hg, blood pressure ≥ 145 mm Hg was associated with increased risks of these events. Second, the type of DOAC should be carefully selected and managed, considering the metabolism of each DOAC and potential drug–drug interactions. Third, all coadministered medications should be reassessed both to evaluate their necessity and to check for possible interactions with oral anticoagulants; the number of medications should be reduced as much as possible to prevent polypharmacy. Fourth, the use of antiplatelet drugs should be reconsidered in patients treated with oral anticoagulants, and — if possible — the antiplatelet drug should be discontinued. Fifth, for patients with a history of bleeding, the cause of bleeding should be treated to reduce the risk of rebleeding during oral anticoagulant therapy. Sixth, periodic observation of renal and liver function should be performed; if renal or hepatic impairment is identified, its cause should be found and treated. If the cause cannot be found or treated, the type and dose of oral anticoagulant should be reviewed, and the use of a low-dose anticoagulant, such as very low-dose edoxaban, may be considered if approved DOAC doses cannot be tolerated. Seventh, although frailty remains a difficult clinical challenge, any contributing factors, such as low physical activity and low bodyweight, need to be addressed if possible, and the risk of falls should be minimized. When major bleeding occurs or nonmajor bleeding reoccurs even with application of these approaches, use of the currently available oral anticoagulant should be withdrawn and other measures, such as a left-atrial appendage closure or resection of the left-atrial appendage, may be considered.

### Gender differences of bleeding and stroke risk in very old atrial fibrillation patients on VKA treatment: results of the EPICA study on the behalf of FCSA (Italian federation of anticoagulation clinics) [^116RRQaR]. Thrombosis Research (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

The prevalence of AF is higher in men and increases with age. However, the number of elderly women is higher than that of elderly men, and AF should be considered to affect men and women equally. Little information exists on elderly AF patients, and in particular, whether stroke and bleeding risk differs between elderly women and elderly men remains unknown.

Methods

We have performed the EPICA Study, a large, multicentre observational study including 4093 elderly patients who started VKA treatment after the age of 80years. In this study, we will focus our analysis on 3015 AF patients followed for 7620 patient-years (pt-yrs) to evaluate if bleeding and stroke risks were different between genders.

Results

During follow-up, we recorded 112 ischemic cerebral events (rate 1.5 ×100pt-years) with no difference between genders. History of previous stroke/TIA, hypertension and artery vascular disease are independently associated with stroke/TIA during treatment. We recorded 132 major bleeds (rate 1.7 ×100pt-years); males showed a higher risk of bleeding (OR 1.5), even if not statistically significant. At multivariate analysis, history of major bleeds, history of falls and active cancer are risk factors independently associated to bleeding.

Conclusion

Elderly patients with AF do not show clear gender related differences in the risk of major adverse events. However, elderly males showed a higher rate of bleeding complications, and females showed a slightly higher rate of stroke, thus suggesting the possibility of a higher net clinical benefit of anticoagulant treatment in females.

### Age as a risk factor for stroke in atrial fibrillation patients: implications for thromboprophylaxis [^114VSgGk]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

The prevalence of atrial fibrillation (AF) is related to age and is projected to rise exponentially as the population ages and the prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors increases. The risk of ischemic stroke is significantly increased in AF patients, and there is evidence of a graded increased risk of stroke associated with advancing age. Oral anticoagulation (OAC) is far more effective than antiplatelet agents at reducing stroke risk in patients with AF. Therefore, increasing numbers of elderly patients are candidates for, and could benefit from, the use of anticoagulants. However, elderly people with AF are less likely to receive OAC therapy. This is mainly due to concerns about a higher risk of OAC-associated hemorrhage in the elderly population. Until recently, older patients were under-represented in randomized controlled trials of OAC versus placebo or antiplatelet therapy, and therefore the evidence base for the value of OAC in the elderly population was not known. However, analyses of the available trial data indicate that the expected net clinical benefit of warfarin therapy is highest among patients with the highest untreated risk for stroke, which includes the oldest age category. An important caveat with warfarin treatment is maintenance of a therapeutic international normalized ratio, regardless of the age of the patient, where time in therapeutic range should be ≥ 65%. Therefore, age alone should not prevent prescription of OAC in elderly patients, given an appropriate stroke and bleeding risk stratification.

### Oral anticoagulants in the oldest old with recent stroke and atrial fibrillation [^112wy6Nb]. Annals of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Notably, there was no signal of a safety concern regarding ICH risk among the oldest‐old DOAC‐treated patients with recent ischemic stroke, which is a widespread concern. In NCB analyses balancing the benefit in stroke reduction against the weighted risk of ICH, the net benefit of DOAC over VKA in these patients was preserved, as indicated by NCB point estimates that were similar in the oldest old as in their younger counterparts, and remained consistently positive across a broad spectrum of ICH weights. Taken together, these findings provide new evidence that the overall beneficial effect of DOAC treatment following recent ischemic stroke is maintained in the oldest old.

These results are clinically important because limited randomized data exist for such patients, as patients with recent stroke within 7 days,14 days, or 30 days, respectively, were excluded from the pivotal DOAC RCTs and the oldest old were severely underrepresented, constituting less than 5% of the RCTs population. While several large observational studies later confirmed the benefits of DOAC in elderly patients with AF, they did not examine patients with a recent ischemic stroke. The fact that the elderly in our study had a recent stroke matters, as such patients – compared to those without recent stroke – have a higher risk for hemorrhagic complications, including ICHand hemorrhagic transformation of the ischemic infarct, concomitant active small vessel disease, and stroke‐induced motor and cognitive deficits with an increased risk of falls.

For patients with recent stroke, subgroup analyses in observational studies suggested the safety of DOAC versus VKA for the age groups of ≥ 75and > 80 years. As we are not aware of any studies investigating AF patients with both (1) age over 85 years and (2) a recent ischemic stroke, our data address an important evidence gap, mitigating concerns about the applicability of the RCT findings in everyday clinical stroke practice and supporting the current guidelines for prevention of stroke recurrence.

### Frail patients who fall and their risk on major bleeding and intracranial haemorrhage. outcomes from the fall and syncope registry [^113qHqsH]. BMC Geriatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Physicians are concerned about the risk of ICH because of anticoagulation, especially among those elderly patients who frequently fall. Dutch guidelines warrant caution when prescribing NOAC. However, data on bleeding risks associated with falling are scarce. Well-known risk factors for ICH are age, previous strokes and bleeding, hypertension, renal impairment, diabetes mellitus and dementia. Cerebral microbleeds (CMB) might also increase the risk of ICH. The CROMIS 2 study showed an increased risk for ICH in patients with AF, recent strokes, or transient ischemic attacks (TIA), and at least 1 CMB at the time of inclusion. However, another cohort of patients with AF and at least 1 CMB, with or without a previous stroke or TIA at baseline, did not show a higher incidence of MB among patients using warfarin or a NOAC, compared with patients without anticoagulation, despite high CHA 2 DS 2 Vasc scores and HAS-BLED score in all study arms (6 and 5 points respectively).

### Atrial fibrillation and oral anticoagulation in older people with frailty: a nationwide primary care electronic health records cohort study [^1158ToKi]. Age and Ageing (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this community-based study of 536,995 older people, one in nine had a diagnosis of AF — of whom almost 90% had concomitant frailty. Patients with AF had higher rates of all-cause mortality, stroke, bleeding, TIA and falls than those without AF. Although overall OAC was prescribed in just half of eligible patients with AF, OAC prescription was more common in patients with frailty. After accounting for demographic profiles and treatment provision, patients with AF and a CHA 2 DS 2 -Vasc score of ≥ 2 had an elevated risk of mortality, GI bleeding, and falls with increasing frailty levels. Women, but not men, had an increased stroke risk associated with increased levels of frailty.

Stroke is a devastating condition — but in patients with AF it is largely preventable through appropriate use of OAC. Yet, prescription rates of OAC are low in eligible patients, as in other studies. In general, stroke disease is significantly more common in older people than is intracranial bleeding, even in the presence of OAC [30, 31]. However, in this study, people with frailty more commonly had falls. Although guidance suggests that OAC should not be withheld solely because a person is at risk of falls, clinicians are fearful of the risk of harm from head injury in those that fall [21, 32, 33]. Other bleeding complications may be poorly tolerated in people with frailty — who have a lower physiological reserve to mount a full recovery [5, 34]. These must be set against a higher absolute risk of stroke, and therefore more needs to be done to understand and overcome reasons for non-prescription of OAC.

### Stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation in the very elderly: anticoagulant therapy is No longer a sin [^113zU3op]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

In all patients, those treated and not treated, the occurrence of stroke/transient ischemic attack/systemic embolism was substantially higher in the older than in the younger cohort (4.8% per year versus 2.3% per year, respectively; P = 0.0006). Similarly, the older cohort had a higher rate of major bleeding than their younger counterparts, although this did not reach significance (4% per year versus 2.7% per year, respectively; P = 0.11), unless those ≥ 85 years were compared with those < 75 years where the rate was 1.9% per year; P = 0.001. Fifty‐one percent of all major bleeds were gastrointestinal, 9% intracerebral, and 43% other sites of bleeding. When comparing those treated with anticoagulants versus not treated or treated only with antiplatelet agents, there was a favorable odds ratio for reduced stroke/transient ischemic attack/systemic embolism in both the elderly cohort (0.64; P = 0.37) and in those < 85 years (0.74; P = 0.26). This represented a greater absolute reduction of 2% in the elderly compared with 0.5% in those < 85 years. In those ≥ 90 years of age, the absolute risk reduction was even greater at 4.6%. What is most important is the finding that major bleeding was not significantly different in either cohort between those treated compared with those not treated with anticoagulants; in the elderly, 4.2% versus 4.0%, respectively; P = 0.77; in those < 85 years, 3.4% versus 2.9%, respectively; P = 0.74. Similar findings were seen in an exploratory analysis of those ≥ 90 years. When comparing those on anticoagulant therapy versus those only on antiplatelet therapy in the very elderly, the incidence of major bleeding was similar (4.1% versus 3.9%, respectively), but higher than in those without any antithrombotic therapy (4.1% versus 2.8%). Finally, net clinical benefit (thrombosis+bleeding+myocardial infarction) significantly favored treatment in the very elderly (P = 0.036). Although not the focus of this report, an incidental finding is that 78% of the very elderly were receiving anticoagulants and over 80% of the entire cohort with a CHA₂DS₂ VASc score ≥ 2 received anticoagulants, thus documenting the changing nature of contemporary physician prescribing behavior. This suggests a greater willingness to treat patients with AF even in the very old compared with studies from the 1990s and early 2000s. This trend has been seen in other recent registries as well 14 and indicates an overall improvement in complying with professional guidelines. The older cohort, however, was also treated more frequently with antiplatelet drugs compared with younger patients (15% versus 11%, respectively), a therapeutic intervention that is both less effective and not any safer.

### Stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation in the very elderly: anticoagulant therapy is No longer a sin [^1154tSKy]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

What do these findings mean in the age of the new direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), which are rapidly gaining market share for stroke prevention in AF? In the Patti et al trial, 12 DOACs had only a small penetration (approximately 6% in each group), limiting an analysis of their performance in the elderly. But in subanalyses of elderly cohorts in the phase 3 AF trials of the DOACs compared with warfarin, the effectiveness and safety of DOACs compared with warfarin was maintained 20, 21, 22 and potentially even greater with similar safety when compared with aspirin. 23 To be sure, the use of DOACs in the very elderly requires special attention to a number of clinical issues such as renal function, drug–drug interactions, tolerability, and others, 24 but most of these are easily manageable. Accordingly, the DOACs, with their improved safety performance, have the potential to change the equation even further, providing a greater net clinical benefit in the very elderly compared with the VKAs.

As other editorials on this topic have proclaimed, 25, 26 it is time for all physicians to recognize that although the very elderly with AF have a higher risk of stroke and major bleeding than those who are younger, the increase in the risk of stroke is greater than the increase in the risk of major bleeding, thus presenting the opportunity for an even greater potential for stroke reduction versus a risk of major bleeding. Secondly, antiplatelet therapy with aspirin is not only less effective, it is also no safer than OAC therapy in the very elderly. It is gratifying to see from this registry that physicians are more willing to employ anticoagulant therapy in these high‐risk patient populations, suggesting that they are beginning to understand that acts of omission are far more serious than acts of commission and that it is no longer a sin to treat the very elderly with anticoagulant therapy.

### Frail patients who fall and their risk on major bleeding and intracranial haemorrhage. outcomes from the fall and syncope registry [^116ooZuF]. BMC Geriatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

When taking the severity of frailty within this cohort into consideration, the results described above do not support the assumption that frail older people run an excessive risk of suffering anticoagulation related bleedings as compared to the fitter older people who were studied in the large RCTs. On the contrary, our findings support the latest ESC guideline on AF that emphasizes a low absolute risk for MB including ICH, and that the benefits of OAC outweigh the risk of bleeding. Since the anticoagulation used in this cohort mostly consists of VKA (80 out of 81, 98.8%), the safety profile could even be better for patients on NOACs. The results of this study, however, show that caution to prescribe OAC to frail older people might be unnecessary and could lead to withholding treatment for those patients at the highest risk of suffering a stroke.

Our study has limitations. The observational design of the study only allows a descriptive analysis and can give an indication of the risks for MB, but cannot provide as robust evidence as a randomized clinical trial can. Furthermore, due to the low number of bleeding evets, the extent to which adjusted Odds Ratios could be calculated is limited. However, the adjusted OR's are comparable to the crude OR's, with a substantial increase in the size of the 95% confidence intervals for the risk on extracranial MB of using either APA or OAC, and a slight narrowing of the confidence interval for the risk for ICH associated with WMH. The OR's were adjusted for the factors with a statistically significant crude OR, except for AF because collinearity with OAC, and age and frailty were added to the model. The adjusted OR's indicate that, naturally, the use of either APA or OAC increases the risk for major bleeding, but in absolute numbers this results in a bleeding rate comparable to the bleeding rate within the large RCTs. Our findings do not support the assumption that frail older people who fall are at a higher risk for major bleeding.

### Stroke prevention with oral anticoagulants in high-risk atrial fibrillation in an aging population [^113QkYaD]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia in the elderly. As the global overall population is aging, the incidence and prevalence of AF have risen markedly in recent decades. In Europe, 18 million people are expected to have AF by 2060, primarily considered to be the result of an increase in patients with AF aged ≥ 80 years. Elderly (age 65–79 years) and very elderly people (age ≥ 80 years) commonly have multimorbidities, which can lead to challenges in managing treatment strategies. AF management is particularly important because of its risk for stroke and systemic thromboembolism. A widely used therapy to prevent stroke and systemic thromboembolism in patients with AF without rheumatic mitral stenosis or mechanical heart valves (hereafter referred to as AF) is direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs). With several advantages over warfarin, including fewer food–drug interactions, patients receiving DOACs have a significantly lower incidence of all-cause mortality and major bleeding than patients receiving warfarin. However, patients in many trials comparing DOACs with warfarin are often younger than patients with AF in actual clinical practice, and there remains a paucity of evidence in very elderly patients. Subgroup analyses of clinical trials have attempted to address these concerns, yet data in very elderly patients and those with a history of bleeding, renal impairment, cognitive impairments, or frailty remain insufficient.

Understanding the risks and benefits of treatments is increasingly important in the context of aging societies (Central Illustration). This state-of-the-art review will examine the current evidence regarding the use of DOACs to improve health outcomes in elderly and very elderly patients with AF. The search terms used were "anticoagulation", "atrial fibrillation", "elder/aging", or "outcome" in Medline, PubMed, EMBASE, and Scopus.

### DOACs for older adults with atrial fibrillation and falls: results from the prospective single-centre DOAFF study [^1167hQUu]. Thrombosis Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Falls are one of the most fearsome events in anticoagulated older adults. The evidence concerning safety of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) in falling elderly patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) is still limited.

Methods

We prospectively enrolled consecutive anticoagulant-naïve patients aged 65 years and older, starting anticoagulation with DOACs for AF. The study cohort was stratified in fallers vs. non-fallers, according to the occurrence of at least one fall during the 2-year follow-up and bleeding outcomes were evaluated.

Results

We enrolled 524 consecutive patients. Mean age was 80.8 years and they were mostly women (54.0%). Among the study cohort, 148 patients (28.2%) presented at least one fall episode during the study period. After the adjustment for potential confounders, no difference was found between fallers and non-fallers for all the study outcomes: major bleeding [HR: 1.04 (95%CI: 0.58–1.85)], intracranial haemorrhage [HR: 1.63 (95%CI: 0.69–3.80)], clinically relevant non-major bleeding [HR: 1.21 (95%CI: 0.83–1.76)], and all-cause death [HR: 1.51 (95%CI: 0.85–2.69)]. The presence of a prior cerebrovascular event [HR: 2.27 (95%CI: 1.12–4.62); p-value: 0.02] and polypharmacy [HR: 1.60 (95%CI: 1.08–2.39); p-value: 0.02] were the main drivers for major and clinically relevant non-major bleedings, respectively.

Conclusions

Falls in an anticoagulant-naïve population aged 65 years and over starting a DOAC for AF do not increase the bleeding risk. Thus, the presence of falls should not discourage clinicians from prescribing DOACs also in this subset of patients.

### Efficacy and safety of direct oral anticoagulants for stroke prevention in older patients with atrial fibrillation: a network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^117TX9ed]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Limitations

This study had several limitations that should be noted. First, our study's results are based on subgroup data from RCTs. Therefore, direct comparisons between each agent may be underpowered. We conducted a comprehensive literature review and included all studies that met our inclusion criteria to increase statistical power. Nevertheless, conclusions from our results should be treated cautiously. Second, the definition of bleeding events, particularly minor bleeding, differed slightly between trials. The RRs extracted from each RCT may reflect slightly different clinical meanings. Similarly, in the subgroup analysis of very old patients, cutoffs for age strata varied in each trial, with some reporting data in patients aged ≥ 80 years and others in patients aged > 85 years. The number of patients available for analysis was even more limited in this extreme population. Our goal was to provide clinical recommendations in treating older patients and not report conclusions on causality. Finally, none of the comparisons of the 2 primary end points (stroke/systemic embolism and major bleeding) were statistically significant in our analyses. Furthermore, no additional subgroup analysis or meta‐regression analyses (eg, to sex or race) was conducted because this was a study‐level meta‐analysis without individual data of the participants. Further studies focused on older patients are needed to validate our findings.

### Antithrombotic therapy for atrial fibrillation: antithrombotic therapy and prevention of thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^117JsQSK]. Chest (2012). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) antithrombotic therapy — stroke prevention conclusions state that stroke is a serious complication of AF with risk varying across patient groups and that antithrombotic prophylaxis is associated with increased bleeding risk; recommendations are based on net clinical benefit across varying stroke-risk levels. Oral anticoagulation is the optimal choice of antithrombotic therapy for patients with AF at high risk of stroke (eg, CHADS₂ score ≥ 2). At lower levels of stroke risk, decisions require an individualized approach considering patient values and preferences, bleeding risk, and non-CHADS2 stroke risk factors. The role of oral anticoagulation for prevention of stroke in AF will evolve with results of large, ongoing, phase 3 RCTs of new oral anticoagulants and as experience with these new agents in clinical practice continues to grow.

### The intersectionality of frailty and anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation [^111zxeFf]. JACC: Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

As the population ages and longevity increases, the prevalence of nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (AF) is concomitantly increasing. In the ATRIA (AnTicoagulation and Risk Factors in Atrial Fibrillation) Registry in a U.S. health maintenance organization, 70% of patients with AF were at least 65 years of age, and 45% were ≥ 75 years of age. In this study, it was estimated that the number of U.S. adults with AF would increase to 5.6 million by the year 2050, with more than half of all affected individuals being older than age 80 years.

At older age, patients with AF have a higher risk of both stroke and bleeding, thus presenting a challenge for decision-making regarding anticoagulation. Recorded stroke rates in patients older than 75 years ranged from 6.9% to 8.9%, and gastrointestinal bleeding rates ranged from 5.4% to 6.6% over a 5-year period. In most studies, advanced age and female sex were associated with less anticoagulant treatment. The most common reason for nonprescription of anticoagulation treatment was frequent falls/frailty; with underutilization and inappropriate dosing more common in older age patients. The risk of falls should rarely be a contraindication to anticoagulation. Older patients with a tendency to fall were reported to have 1.81 falls annually. The risk of subdural hematoma has to be > 535 fold, so one would have to fall 295 (535/1.81) times a year to outweigh the benefits of anticoagulation with warfarin in one report. Participants with a history of falls in the ARISTOTLE trial or with a risk of falls in the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 trial did not demonstrate a significant interaction between a history of falls or risk of falls on either the efficacy or safety of anticoagulation; this was despite the fact that those with a risk of falls were older and had more comorbidity.

### Bleeding risk in very old patients on vitamin K antagonist treatment: results of a prospective collaborative study on elderly patients followed by Italian centres for anticoagulation [^116uinBX]. Circulation (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Vitamin K antagonist (VKA) therapy is increasingly being used for the prevention of venous thromboembolism and stroke in atrial fibrillation. Bleeds are the major concern for VKA prescription, especially in very old patients who carry many risk factors for bleeding. We performed a large multicenter prospective observational study that enrolled very old patients to evaluate the quality of anticoagulation and the incidence of bleedings.

Methods and Results

The study included 4093 patients ≥ 80 years of age who were naïve to VKA for thromboprophylaxis of atrial fibrillation or after venous thromboembolism. Patients' demographic and clinical data were collected, and the quality of anticoagulation and the incidence of bleeding were recorded. The follow-up was 9603 patient-years; median age at the beginning of follow-up was 84 years (range, 80 to 102 years). We recorded 179 major bleedings (rate, 1.87 per 100 patient-years), 26 fatal (rate, 0.27 per 100 patient-years). The rate of bleeding was higher in men compared with women (relative risk, 1.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.12 to 1.72; P = 0.002) and among patients ≥ 85 years of age compared with younger patients (relative risk, 1.3; 95% confidence interval, 1.0 to 1.65; P = 0.048). Time in therapeutic range was 62% (interquartile range, 49% to 75%). History of bleeding, active cancer, and history of falls were independently associated with bleeding risk in Cox regression analysis.

Conclusion

In this large study on very old patients on VKA carefully monitored by anticoagulation clinics, the rate of bleedings was low, suggesting that age in itself should not be considered a contraindication to treatment. Adequate management of VKA therapy in specifically trained center allows very old and frail patients to benefit from VKA thromboprophylaxis.

### Outcomes of elderly patients undergoing left atrial appendage closure [^114UmLjh]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

The prevalence of atrial fibrillation increases with age, as does the risk of cerebrovascular accidents. Moreover, its has been shown that individuals aged 80 years or older have > 20% of atrial fibrillation–related strokesand these are often more severe in terms of disability and mortality. While oral anticoagulation therapy is the mainstay for thromboembolic cerebrovascular accidents prevention, elderly patients are at increased risk of bleeding events; hence, these drugs are often underused, mainly because of advanced age or the perceived high‐risk of bleeding complications, falls, or even polypharmacy.,

Studies have demonstrated the safety and efficacy of left atrial appendage closure (LAAC) to reduce the risk of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation, and current guidelines recommend LAAC for individuals in whom long‐term oral anticoagulation is considered either suboptimal or contraindicated. Patients referred for LAAC often present with overlapping risks of systemic thromboembolism and bleeding events. In addition, elderly patients are generally frailer and have higher comorbidity burden, both of which often co‐exist and influence clinical outcomes. Therefore, we aimed to compare in‐hospital outcomes in patients ≥ 80 years old to younger patients, and to determine the factors associated with increased risk of adverse events after LAAC.

### Antithrombotic therapy for atrial fibrillation: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^116oV7Wb]. Chest (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The risk of stroke is heterogeneous across different groups of patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), being dependent on the presence of various stroke risk factors. We provide recommendations for antithrombotic treatment based on net clinical benefit for patients with AF at varying levels of stroke risk and in a number of common clinical scenarios.

Methods

Systematic literature reviews were conducted to identify relevant articles published from the last formal search perfomed for the Antithrombotic and Thrombolytic Therapy: American College of Chest Physicians Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines (9th Edition). The overall quality of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) approach. Graded recommendations and ungraded consensus-based statements were drafted, voted on, and revised until consensus was reached.

Results

For patients with AF without valvular heart disease, including those with paroxysmal AF, who are at low risk of stroke (eg, CHA₂DS₂-VASc [congestive heart failure, hypertension, age ≥ 75 (doubled), diabetes, stroke (doubled)-vascular disease, age 65–74 and sex category (female)] score of 0 in males or 1 in females), we suggest no antithrombotic therapy. The next step is to consider stroke prevention (ie, oral anticoagulation therapy) for patients with 1 or more non-sex CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc stroke risk factors. For patients with a single non-sex CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc stroke risk factor, we suggest oral anticoagulation rather than no therapy, aspirin, or combination therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel; and for those at high risk of stroke (eg, CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc ≥ 2 in males or ≥ 3 in females), we recommend oral anticoagulation rather than no therapy, aspirin, or combination therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel. Where we recommend or suggest in favor of oral anticoagulation, we suggest using a non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant drug rather than adjusted-dose vitamin K antagonist therapy. With the latter, it is important to aim for good quality anticoagulation control with a time in therapeutic range > 70%. Attention to modifiable bleeding risk factors (eg, uncontrolled BP, labile international normalized ratios, concomitant use of aspirin or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs in an anticoagulated patient, alcohol excess) should be made at each patient contact, and HAS-BLED (hypertension, abnormal renal/liver function [1 point each], stroke, bleeding history or predisposition, labile international normalized ratio, elderly (0.65), drugs/alcohol concomitantly [1 point each]) score used to assess the risk of bleeding where high risk patients (≥ 3) should be reviewed and followed up more frequently.

Conclusions

Oral anticoagulation is the optimal choice of antithrombotic therapy for patients with AF with ≥ 1 non-sex CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc stroke risk factor(s).

### Stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation in the very elderly: anticoagulant therapy is No longer a sin [^116pHqwx]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

What are the take‐home messages from this prospective observational registry? First, it focuses on the very elderly and confirms the higher risk of stroke and major bleeding compared with a younger cohort. Second, it shows that the benefit of treating such patients with anticoagulants outweighs the risk of major bleeding. Third, it supports evidence that antiplatelet therapy with aspirin is associated with a similar risk of major bleeding as with OAC. Fourth, and as an incidental finding, it suggests that contemporary physician prescribing patterns for stroke prevention in AF in the very elderly are changing, with a greater willingness to anticoagulate such patients.

These results support other recent studies of anticoagulant therapy in the very elderly. 15, 16, 17, 18 The BAFTA trial (Birmingham Atrial Fibrillation Treatment of the Aged Study) compared VKA therapy with antiplatelet therapy as stroke prevention in 973 patients 75 years or older. 15 Investigators showed a significant reduction in stroke, systemic embolism, or intracranial hemorrhage with VKA therapy (1.8% versus 3.8%; relative risk 0.48, 95% CI 0.28–0.80; P = 0.003). At the same time, extracranial hemorrhage was no different between groups (VKA 1.4% versus aspirin 1.6%). In a very large cohort of 4093 patients ≥ 80 years of age treated with OAC for a variety of indications, Poli et al 18 found a major bleeding rate of only 1.87%, which compares very well with the bleeding rate in the BAFTA trial. Ogilvie et al, 19 in a meta‐analysis of outcomes of OAC therapy compared with aspirin therapy in real‐world patients outside of clinical trials, further confirmed the benefit of OAC and the lack of improved safety with antiplatelet therapy.

### Adverse events in clinically complex elderly patients with atrial fibrillation according to oral anticoagulation status [^117QXZFP]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

The data from our study contrasts with a previous study that investigated the impact of OAC discontinuation in a cohort of 1578 AF patients aged ≥ 75 years from Italy. In this study, although OAC discontinuation was associated with an increased one-year risk of all-cause death, it was not associated with an increased risk of thromboembolism or major bleeding after adjustment for confounders. This discrepancy could be related to the relatively small sample size and the low overall incidence of thromboembolic (2.6%) and haemorrhagic events (4.7%) recorded during the study period, as well as the higher incidence of death observed in that cohort compared to ours, that may have caused a more substantial competing risk effect on non-fatal outcomes. As we have shown in our study, the risk of adverse events in this clinical context is dynamic and should be addressed in different time windows.

This clinical scenario is even more complicated when considering the implications on other management aspects. Indeed, the low likelihood of undergoing ablation procedures observed in AF patients with CC who discontinued OAC may contribute to the elevated risk of adverse events seen in these patients, given the superiority of early rhythm control over rate control in reducing the risk of adverse events and death in AF patients, even with multimorbidity. Several factors, including the perceived higher risk of adverse events such as serious bleeding, may have contraindicated these interventional procedures in some AF patients with CC at high bleeding risk and may explain these results. Indeed, the higher risk for falls found in AF patients with CC who discontinued OAC seem consistent with the hypothesis that the perceived baseline risk of these patients may have influenced both the interruption of OAC, the lower likelihood of interventional procedures, and the overall higher risk of adverse outcomes.

### Use of oral anticoagulant therapy in older adults with atrial fibrillation after acute ischemic stroke [^114bk4ee]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2017). Low credibility.

Objectives

To explore barriers to anticoagulation in older adults with atrial fibrillation (AF) at high risk of stroke and to identify opportunities for interventions that might increase use of oral anticoagulants (OACs).

Design

Retrospective cohort study.

Setting

Two large community-based AF cohorts.

Participants

Individuals with ischemic stroke surviving hospitalization (N = 1,405, mean age 79).

Measurements

Using structured chart review, reasons for nonuse of OAC were identified, and 1-year poststroke survival was assessed. Logistic regression was used to identify correlates of OAC nonuse.

Results

Median CHA₂DS₂-VASc score was 5, yet 44% of participants were not prescribed an OAC at discharge. The most-frequent (nonmutually exclusive) physician reasons for not prescribing OAC included fall risk (26.7%), poor prognosis (19.3%), bleeding history (17.1%), participant or family refusal (14.9%), older age (11.0%), and dementia (9.4%). Older age (odds ratio (OR) = 8.96, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 5.01–16.04 for aged ≥ 85 vs < 65) and disability (OR = 12.58, 95% CI = 5.82–27.21 for severe vs no deficit) were the most-important independent predictors of nonuse of OACs. By 1 year, 42.5% of those not receiving an OAC at discharge had died, versus 19.1% of those receiving an OAC (P < .001), far higher than recurrent stroke rates.

Conclusion

Despite very high stroke risk, more than 40% of participants were not discharged with an OAC. Dominant reasons included fall risk, poor prognosis, older age, and dementia. These individuals' high 1-year mortality rate confirmed their high level of comorbidity. To improve anticoagulation decisions and outcomes in this population, future research should focus on strategies to mitigate fall risk, improve assessment of risks and benefits of anticoagulation in individuals with AF, and determine whether newer anticoagulants are safer in complex elderly and frail individuals.

### SUPPORT-AF: piloting a multi-faceted, electronic medical record-based intervention to improve prescription of anticoagulation [^115azg46]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Atrial fibrillation (AF) currently affects 5.2 million Americans, with 12 million projected by 2050. 1, 2, 3 AF accounts for 15% of all ischemic strokes and one third of all strokes in the elderly. 4 These strokes result in permanent disability in 60% of patients and death in up to 20%. 5 Anticoagulation (AC) therapy is the cornerstone for stroke prevention in patients with AF. However, only around half of eligible patients receive AC in contemporary US‐based, ambulatory registries. 6

Providers and patients struggle with the decision to initiate AC in new cases of AF or resume AC in patients previously on it. The American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology guidelines advise providers about stroke risk, recommending initiation of AC for eligible patients (ie, those with a stroke risk CHA₂DS₂‑VASc score of 2 or higher). 7 Providers often point to concerns about complications from AC in older, frail patients and prohibitive bleeding risks as reasons for not prescribing AC, but data show that physicians often overestimate risks of bleeding and falling and underestimate risks of stroke. 6 Although much work has been done to educate providers about the risks of undertreatment, an "AC treatment gap" between eligible and treated AF patients persists, leading to significant morbidity and mortality. 8, 9

### Oral anticoagulants to reduce the risk of stroke in atrial fibrillation: how should a clinician choose? [^117Kev5X]. Clinical Cardiology (2013). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF), a common arrhythmia that occurs with increasing frequency in the aging population, is associated with increased mortality and morbidity. To ensure that patients receive adequate anticoagulant prophylaxis, clinical guidelines for anticoagulation advocate use of validated scoring systems to stratify patients by cardiovascular risk and predict the individual patient's risk of adverse effects of therapy. Recently approved oral anticoagulants-a direct thrombin inhibitor and the factor Xa inhibitors-may offer advantages over the 50-year standard, warfarin, for efficacy, safety, and ease of administration. Clinical trial experience with the newly approved agents and others, yet to be approved, will define their relative value in reducing the risk of thromboembolism associated with AF. This article discusses issues that may help clinicians choose among these newer agents and individualize treatment appropriately.

### Effect of age on stroke prevention therapy in patients with atrial fibrillation: the atrial fibrillation investigators [^116tLt25]. Stroke (2009). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Stroke risk increases with age in patients who have nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. It is uncertain whether the efficacy of stroke prevention therapies in atrial fibrillation changes as patients age. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of age on the relative efficacy of oral anticoagulants (OAC) and antiplatelet (AP) therapy (including acetylsalicylic acid and triflusal) on ischemic stroke, serious bleeding, and vascular events in patients with atrial fibrillation.

Methods

This is an analysis of the Atrial Fibrillation Investigators database, which contains patient level-data from randomized trials of stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation. We used Cox regression models with age as a continuous variable that controlled for sex, year of randomization, and history of cerebrovascular disease, diabetes, hypertension, and congestive heart failure. Outcomes included ischemic stroke, serious bleeding (intracranial hemorrhage or systemic bleeding requiring hospitalization, transfusion, or surgery), and cardiovascular events (ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction, systemic embolism, or vascular death).

Results

The analysis included 8932 patients and 17 685 years of observation from 12 trials. Patient age increased risk of ischemic stroke (adjusted hazard ratio per decade increase 1.45; 95% CI, 1.26 to 1.66), serious bleeding (1.61; 1.47 to 1.77), and cardiovascular events (1.43; 1.33 to 1.53). Compared with placebo, OAC and AP significantly reduced the risk of ischemic stroke (OAC, 0.36; 0.29 to 0.45; AP, 0.81; 0.72 to 0.90) and cardiovascular outcomes (OAC, 0.59; 0.52 to 0.66; AP, 0.81; 0.75 to 0.88), whereas OAC increased risk of serious bleeding (1.56; 1.03 to 2.37). The relative benefit of OAC versus placebo or AP did not vary by patient age for any outcome. Compared with placebo, the relative benefit of AP for preventing ischemic stroke decreased significantly as patients aged (P = 0.01).

Conclusions

As patients with atrial fibrillation age, the relative efficacy of AP to prevent ischemic stroke appears to decrease, whereas it does not change for OAC. Because stroke risk increases with age, the absolute benefit of OAC increases as patients get older.

### Thromboembolic risk, bleeding outcomes and effect of different antithrombotic strategies in very elderly patients with atrial fibrillation: a sub-analysis from the PREFER in AF (trialibrillation).vention oThromboembolic events-uropeanegistry in… [^111Mrwbg]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

In conclusion, our study supports the use of anticoagulant therapy also in very elderly patients with AF. Because stroke risk dramatically increases with age, the absolute benefit of oral anticoagulation is highest in very elderly populations and this largely outweighs the bleeding risk, achieving the most favorable net clinical benefit as patients get older. Logical considerations and evidence‐base data make NOACs the anticoagulant drugs of choice in such patients.

### Prior history of falls and risk of outcomes in atrial fibrillation: the loire valley atrial fibrillation project [^115W2AX5]. The American Journal of Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation are often denied oral anticoagulation due to falls risk. The latter is variably defined, and existing studies have not compared the associated risk of bleeding with other cardiovascular events. There are no data about outcomes in individuals with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation with a prior history of (actual) falls, rather than being "at risk of falls". Our objective was to evaluate the risk of cardiovascular outcomes associated with prior history of falls in patients with atrial fibrillation in a contemporary "real world" cohort.

Methods

Patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation in a 4-hospital institution between 2000 and 2010 were included. Stroke/thromboembolism event rates were calculated according to prior history of falls. Risk factors were investigated by Cox regression.

Results

Among 7156 atrial fibrillation patients, prior history of falls/trauma was uncommon (n = 76; 1.1%). Compared with patients without history of falls, those patients were older and less likely to be on oral anticoagulation; they also had higher risk scores for stroke/thromboembolism but not for bleeding. Compared with no prior history of falls, rates of stroke/thromboembolism (P = 0.01) and all-cause mortality (P < .0001) were significantly higher in patients with previous falls. In multivariable analyses, prior history of falls was independently associated with stroke/thromboembolism (hazard ratio [HR] 5.19; 95% confidence interval, 2.1–12.6; P < .0001), major bleeding (HR 3.32 [1.23–8.91]; p = 0.02), and all-cause mortality (HR 3.69; 95% CI, 1.52–8.95; p = 0.04), but not hemorrhagic stroke (HR 4.20; 95% CI, 0.58–30.48; p = 0.16) in patients on oral anticoagulation.

Conclusion

In this large "real world" atrial fibrillation cohort, prior history of falls was uncommon but independently increased risk of stroke/thromboembolism, bleeding, and mortality, but not hemorrhagic stroke in the presence of anticoagulation. Prior history of (actual) falls may be a more clinically useful risk prognosticator than "being at risk of falls".

### Outcomes and safety of very-low-dose edoxaban in frail patients with atrial fibrillation in the ELDERCARE-AF randomized clinical trial [^111cXoVX]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

The prevalence of atrial fibrillation (AF), a common arrhythmia, increases with age, and frailty is also a common condition affecting the older population. Frailty is defined as the increased vulnerability resulting from an aging-associated decline in reserve and function across multiple physiological mechanisms, which is associated with an increased risk of a range of adverse outcomes, including weight loss, risk of falls, and renal deterioration. To prevent cardioembolic stroke in patients with AF, the clinical guidelines recommend using direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) even in elderly and frail patients. However, as use of DOACs can increase the risk of bleeding, assessment and monitoring of the risk factors associated with frailty are recommended. The benefits of DOAC treatment are reported to outweigh the risks associated with frailty; however, evidence for the use of DOACs in very elderly patients with AF with frailty is lacking. Many physicians remain reluctant to prescribe standard doses of DOACs to very elderly patients with frailty because of risk factors for bleeding in this patient group, such as severe renal impairment, history of bleeding, previous falls, low body weight, and polypharmacy.

### Restarting and timing of oral anticoagulation after traumatic intracranial hemorrhage: a review and summary of ongoing and planned prospective randomized clinical trials [^111sWmzu]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2020). Medium credibility.

Even considering the potential for elevated risk of major hemorrhage, ICrH and associated mortality, studies suggest that the benefits of treatment with anticoagulation outweigh any harms. A theoretical, clinical decision-analytic model was used to parse the optimal treatment strategy in a population of elderly patients with AF at risk for falling. Controlling for age and baseline stroke risk, implementing warfarin therapy (the only treatment available at that time) was associated with > 2.5 greater quality-adjusted life-years than withholding antithrombotic treatment in elderly patients. Their analysis showed that a patient would need to fall approximately 295 times in a year to exceed the benefit of stroke prevention from anticoagulation therapy. In the optimization model, fall risk was not a relevant factor in the clinical decision to start treatment.

There are scales to quantify the bleeding risk in the anticoagulated patients, such as HAS-BLEDand HEMORR 2 HAGESand others. Creators note that the scales were primarily created to identify modifiable risk factors, for example, excessive alcohol use, not to exclude patients from anticoagulation treatment.

Falls are always a concern regarding the balance of risk/benefit in patients with atrial fibrillation treated with anticoagulants. In this analysis, we aimed to evaluate the outcomes of patients that had a fall/head injury reported in the RE-LY clinical trial (Randomized Evaluation of Long-Term Anticoagulation Therapy) and to explore the safety of dabigatran (a nonvitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant).

Methods

We performed a post hoc retrospective analysis of intracranial hemorrhage and major bleeding outcomes in the RE-LY trial with 18113 individuals with atrial fibrillation, according to the status occurrence of falls (or head injury) reported as adverse events. Multivariate Cox regression models were used to provide adjusted hazard ratio (HR) and 95% CI.

Results

In the study, 974 falls or head injury events were reported among 716 patients (4%). These patients were older and had more frequently comorbidities such as diabetes, previous stroke, or coronary artery disease. Patients with fall had a higher risk of major bleeding (HR, 2.41 [95% CI, 1.90–3.05]), intracranial hemorrhage (HR, 1.69 [95% CI, 1.35–2.13]), and mortality (HR, 3.91 [95% CI, 2.51–6.10]) compared to those who did not have reported falls or head injury. Among patients who had falls, those allocated to dabigatran showed a lower intracranial hemorrhage risk (HR, 0.42 [95% CI, 0.18–0.98]) compared with warfarin.

Conclusions

In this population, the risk of falls is important and confers a worse prognosis, increasing intracranial hemorrhage, and major bleeding. Patients who fell and were under dabigatran was associated with lower intracranial hemorrhage risk than those anticoagulated with warfarin, but the analysis was merely exploratory.

Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

Anticoagulation thresholds in atrial fibrillation — intermediate risk: although risk stratification schemes identify patients who benefit most and least from anticoagulation, the threshold for use of anticoagulation is controversial, and opinion is particularly divided about anticoagulation for those at intermediate risk (stroke rate 3% to 5% per year); some advocate routine anticoagulation at this level, whereas others favor selective anticoagulation with weight given to bleeding risks and preferences, and the threshold of benefit at which AF patients choose anticoagulation varies, with some at intermediate risk electing anticoagulation whereas others do not.

Complicating factors in treating elderly and very elderly patients with AF

Increased age, frailty, renal impairment, bleeding history, cognitive decline, and the presence of multimorbidities and polypharmacy — including concomitant antiplatelet therapy — are considered complicating factors in elderly and very elderly patients with AF.

Increased age

Elderly patients with AF have both a higher risk of thromboembolismand a higher risk of bleeding. All pivotal DOAC trials demonstrate consistent efficacy of each DOAC vs warfarin in stroke prevention across different age strata, whereas the safety profile of each DOAC vs warfarin is not necessarily consistent across age groups (Table 1). In patients aged ≥ 75 years, compared with warfarin, dabigatran 150 mg twice a day showed a trend toward higher risk of major bleeding, and dabigatran 110 mg twice a day showed a similar bleeding risk. Rivaroxaban vs warfarin showed a similar risk of major bleeding in patients aged ≥ 75 years. In contrast, apixaban vs warfarin showed a significantly lower rate of major bleeding in patients aged ≥ 75 years. Both higher (standard) and lower (half) doses of edoxaban vs warfarin showed a significantly lower risk of major bleeding in those aged ≥ 75 years.

Table 1
Bleeding Risks of Each DOAC in Patients Aged ≥ 75 Years

A retrospective meta-analysis and a systematic analysis showed that very elderly patients have improved outcomes with DOACs than with warfarin, and edoxaban and apixaban are better tolerated than other treatments. However, even with DOAC use, the risk of bleeding appears to increase with age, especially in very elderly patients.

Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Approaches to prevent cardioembolic complications of atrial fibrillation (AF) in older subjects may have a prominent impact on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality of these patients and on health economy. Indeed, there is a progressive aging of Western populations, with the proportion of individuals aged ≥ 85 years being expected to have a 3‐fold increase by the year 2035 worldwide. 1 Advancing age predisposes to AF and is associated with increases of both thromboembolic risk and antithrombotic drug‐related bleeding once AF occurs. 2, 3, 4

A previous randomized study (BAFTA [Birmingham Atrial Fibrillation Treatment of the Aged]) 5 has indicated that, among elderly patients (aged ≥ 75 years) with AF, the use of warfarin is associated with significant reduction of thromboembolic complications compared with antiplatelet therapy. Such results were replicated in a subgroup analysis on patients with AF and age ≥ 75 years from the AVERROES (Apixaban Versus Acetylsalicylic Acid to Prevent Stroke in Atrial Fibrillation Patients Who Have Failed or Are Unsuitable for Vitamin K Antagonist Treatment) trial, 6 in which the non–vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant (NOAC), apixaban, was tested against aspirin in patients who had contraindications to anticoagulation with warfarin, were unwilling to take it or were considered unsuitable to it. Of note, a patient‐level meta‐analysis of 6 randomized trials in the setting of AF showed no interaction between effects of anticoagulant versus antiplatelet treatment on bleeding or ischemic end points and age (< 75 versus ≥ 75 years). 7 Despite this information, advanced age remains one of the major reasons for physicians to withhold oral anticoagulation from AF patients.

There is a broad interest in the best treatment of very elderly patients with cardiovascular diseases, usually defined as ≥ 85 years. 8, 9, 10 Unfortunately, there has, so far, been no controlled trial with sufficient power in this age group to inform treatment of very elderly patients with AF. Therefore, we have explored this issue in a large, multicenter registry on AF patients. Moreover, because the absolute increase in mortality related to thromboembolic and hemorrhagic events is prominent in older populations, we have also here carried out a weighted net clinical benefit analysis, by adjusting each major nonfatal ischemic and hemorrhagic events for the specific risk of death of such adverse events, occurring with either oral anticoagulation or no anticoagulation.

### Adverse events in clinically complex elderly patients with atrial fibrillation according to oral anticoagulation status [^111ZDWtv]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this study, our main findings are as follows: 1) AF patients with CC who discontinued long-term OAC exhibited an increased risk of all-cause death and MACE along, without statistically significant differences in the risk of major bleeding; 2) AF patients with CC who discontinued OAC were also less likely undergoing ablation procedures compared to those who maintained OAC, and at higher risk of falling; 3) the risk of primary outcomes was highest in the initial phase of follow-up, when the risk of major bleeding was also significantly increased; however, the risk differences tended to be mitigated in the subsequent phase of follow-up, with risk of major bleeding becoming non-significant, while the risk of all-cause death and MACE, remained significantly elevated; 4) the increased risk of adverse events was similar across sex and prevalent CC manifestations; 4) both warfarin and NOACs discontinuations were associated with an increased risk of MACE and similar bleeding risk compared to patients who continued these treatments. Of note, NOACs discontinuation had a larger magnitude impact on the risk of all-cause death than warfarin discontinuation.

### Geriatric trauma management [^111pxRPf]. ACS (2023). High credibility.

Falls in older adults with atrial fibrillation — if a fall was the mechanism of injury, assessment by a fall specialist or physical therapist is recommended prior to renewal of anticoagulation, and initiation of one of several evidence-based fall-reduction interventions is suggested. Among patients with AF and at average risk of stroke and falls, warfarin therapy was associated with 12.90 quality-adjusted life-years, aspirin therapy with 11.17 years, and no therapy with 10.15 years; for the risks of warfarin therapy to outweigh the benefits among patients with AF who fall, the risk of subdural hematoma must be 35 times greater than among those who do not fall, and in their model the average person over 65 years had 1.81 falls a year, so a person taking warfarin would need to fall 295 times in one year before warfarin was not regarded as the optimal therapy.

### Efficacy, safety, and bleeding risk factor analysis of oral anticoagulants in AF patients ≥ 65 years of age: a multicenter retrospective cohort study [^111BB57S]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common clinical arrhythmia, with a worldwide prevalence of 2–4%, and the prevalence of AF increases with age. A study by Singer et al. suggested that age is a continuous risk factor for increased risk of thromboembolism in patients with AF, with an increased risk of thromboembolism in patients with AF between the ages of 65 to 74 years, 75 to 84, and ages ≥ 85 years by a factor of 2.38, 4.46, and 8.14, respectively. Therefore, oral anticoagulant (OAC) therapy is recommended to reduce the risk of stroke or systemic embolism in elderly patients with AF who have risk factors for stroke. In AF patients, stroke prevention can be performed in high risk patients based on the CHA2DS2-VASc score, and anticoagulation prophylaxis with warfarin has traditionally been recommended. However, overcoming some of the limitations of warfarin, and with the advantages of a predictable pharmacological effect and no need for routine coagulation monitoring, novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) have become the most commonly prescribed medication for the prevention of ischaemic stroke in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) and for the treatment and prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE), and these advantages may improve the convenience of medication for elderly patients. However, the comparison between NOACs and warfarin in clinical practice in elderly Asian patients has not been well studied.

Four large randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have shown that NOACs (dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban) are noninferior to warfarin in preventing the risk of stroke and systemic embolism as well as major bleeding. However, in elderly patients with AF, there are some discrepancies in populations of different ages and countries. In addition, older patients in RCT are usually a selected group who are relatively healthy and have fewer comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, heart failure, and coronary atherosclerosis. However, in real-world trials, elderly patients with AF are often accompanied by cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, hepatic and renal insufficiency, and extreme body weight, all of which can affect the pharmacokinetics of NOACs, and increase the risk of adverse events (e.g. hemorrhage). Real-world populations differ from those in RCT, and these differences may have a significant impact on the benefit-risk ratio of NOACs, compared with warfarin. Therefore, it is important to analyze the effectiveness and safety of NOACs use in real-world elder adults.

### Efficacy and safety of direct oral anticoagulants for stroke prevention in older patients with atrial fibrillation: a network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^116wcdxM]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained arrhythmia in adults worldwide, with a reported lifetime risk of up to 1 in every 3 individuals. AF risk increases with age, especially in those aged > 65 years. As the global population continues to age, people living with AF have increased substantially over the past 50 years, reaching almost 60 million globally by 2019, leading to 0.315 million deaths and 8.39 million disability‐adjusted life years lost. An estimated 2.5 million deaths could be attributable to AF between 2030 and 2034. Therefore, AF is an increasingly important global health issue.

One key element of AF management is preventing thromboembolic complications. However, anticoagulation benefits are often offset by increased bleeding risk. Many validated scoring systems for risk stratification, indicate that specific clinical factors lead to increased thromboembolic and bleeding event risks. For example, advanced age is included in the CHA₂DS₂‐VASc stroke score (congestive heart failure, hypertension, age ≥ 75 [doubled], diabetes mellitus, prior stroke or transient ischemic attack [doubled], vascular disease, age 65–74, and sex category [female])for AF stroke risk and the Hypertension, Abnormal renal/liver function, Stroke, Bleeding, Labile International Normalized Ratio (INR), Elderly, Drugs or alcohol use (HAS‐BLED) scorefor major bleeding risk. Indeed, an age ≥ 75 years counts for 2 points in the CHA₂DS₂‐VASc score. Older age is associated with elevated ischemic stroke and systemic embolism risks in patients with AF, and the proportion of strokes attributable to AF also increases with age. Conversely, the incidence of intracranial hemorrhages (ICHs) during warfarin therapy for stroke prevention is substantially higher in the older population, particularly in those aged > 85 years. Stroke prevention in older patients with AF remains a clinical dilemma and challenge.

### Thromboembolic risk, bleeding outcomes and effect of different antithrombotic strategies in very elderly patients with atrial fibrillation: a sub-analysis from the PREFER in AF (trialibrillation).vention oThromboembolic events-uropeanegistry in… [^111n5MbV]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

In this analysis of individual patients' data from the real‐world, prospective PREFER in AF, we have found that in very elderly patients (aged ≥ 85 years): (1) The benefit of anticoagulant treatment over no anticoagulation for prevention of thromboembolic events is largely maintained, with anticoagulation being associated with the greatest absolute reduction of those complications; and (2) in the subgroup on anticoagulant therapy, the bleeding risk was not higher than that of patients receiving antiplatelet treatment. We have also found that the older the patients with AF, the higher was the weighted net clinical benefit in favor of anticoagulant therapy.

Previous data from the ENGAGE AF trial on warfarin‐treated patients indicated a 2‐ and 3‐fold elevation of thromboembolic events and major hemorrhagic complications, respectively, when comparing patients aged ≥ 75 years to those < 65 years. 19 This was also confirmed in the subanalyses on elderly patients from other phase III trials comparing NOACs versus warfarin in patients with nonvalvular AF 20, 21, 22 and in a recent cohort study on patients at a service center receiving vitamin K antagonists. 23 In the present investigation, we report on an evaluation of thromboembolic and bleeding outcomes of even older populations in the setting of AF. Our real‐world findings expand previous observations, showing that regardless of antithrombotic therapies in patients aged ≥ 85 years, overall risk of stroke/TIA/systemic embolism is significantly higher compared with any strata of younger age, that is, a 2.6‐fold elevation versus patients aged < 75 years and a 1.6‐fold elevation versus those aged 75 to 84 years; conversely, the overall bleeding risk was higher than for patients with age < 75 years, but similar to those between 75 and 84 years. Of note, in the very elderly population, there was an 0.8% excess absolute risk of thromboembolic events at 1 year compared with major bleeding events. Accordingly, the major concern in this setting of patients appears to be the thromboembolic risk rather than the propensity of bleeding related to anticoagulant treatment.

### Frail patients who fall and their risk on major bleeding and intracranial haemorrhage. outcomes from the fall and syncope registry [^114MzgUr]. BMC Geriatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

This study investigated factors associated with major bleeding, and intra cranial haemorrhage, among a cohort of geriatric patients with repeated falls. On average, this cohort was severely frail, and 90% frequently fell. Patients had a median age of 80 years, suffered from multi morbidity and polypharmacy. Consequently, this is a cohort with a high anticipated bleeding risk, reflected in the HAS-BLED score of 2.8. Our study shows two important findings.

Firstly, the number of MBs and ICHs in patients on OAC is low, with 1.32 MB and 0.33 ICH per 100 patient treatment years, a bleeding rate comparable to, or lower than, the rates found in the large RCTs. In this cohort most patients used VKA (1 patient was on a NOAC and did not experience a bleeding event). In the AMADEUS trial the rate of MB in the warfarin arm was 2.6, the RE-LY study 3.4, the ARISTOTLE trial 3.1, the ENGAGE-AF-TIMI 3.4, and in the ROCKET-AF 3.4 MB per 100 treatment years. The average HASBLED score of our cohort was 2.8, which is comparable to the ROCKET-AF trial, but the bleeding event rate was much lower. A possible explanation for this difference lies in our extensive follow-up. The trials vary between 1 and 2.8 years of follow-up per patient, whereas in our study twenty-two out of 81 (27%) patients used OAC for more than 10 years. The bleedings in our cohort occurred during the range of 7 months to 10 years of OAC use, well beyond the duration of follow-up of the RCTs. This results in a much higher total number of treatment years and therefore a lower ratio of bleeding per 100 years. Simultaneously, among patients who had used OAC for over 10 years, no bleedings occurred. Our data could suggest that if a patient is prone to bleeding, bleeding will occur relatively early. Another possible explanation could lie within competing factors. A large proportion of the cohort died during the follow up, 29%, as would be expected for this age group. Since the majority of patients were frail, in general a higher rate of mortality and complications is to be expected. This could have led to patients dying of other causes, instead of suffering a MB, and a lower rate of bleeding per 100 treatment years.

### Incidence of intracranial hemorrhage in patients with atrial fibrillation who are prone to fall [^114gQW7h]. The American Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose

Patients at high risk for falls are presumed to be at increased risk for intracranial hemorrhage, and high risk for falls is cited as a contraindication to antithrombotic therapy. Data substantiating this concern are lacking.

Methods

Quality improvement organizations identified 1245 Medicare beneficiaries who were documented in the medical record to be at high risk of falls and 18261 other patients with atrial fibrillation. The patients were elderly (mean 80 years), and 48% were prescribed warfarin at hospital discharge. The primary endpoint was subsequent hospitalization for an intracranial hemorrhage, based on ICD-9 codes.

Results

Rates (95% confidence interval [CI]) of intracranial hemorrhage per 100 patient-years were 2.8 (1.9–4.1) in patients at high risk for falls and 1.1 (1.0–1.3) in other patients. Rates (95% CI) of traumatic intracranial hemorrhage were 2.0 (1.3–3.1) in patients at high risk for falls and 0.34 (0.27–0.45) in other patients. Hazard ratios (95% CI) of other independent risk factors for intracranial hemorrhage were 1.4 (1.0–3.1) for neuropsychiatric disease, 2.1 (1.6–2.7) for prior stroke, and 1.9 (1.4–2.4) for prior major bleeding. Warfarin prescription was associated with intracranial hemorrhage mortality but not with intracranial hemorrhage occurrence. Ischemic stroke rates per 100 patient-years were 13.7 in patients at high risk for falls and 6.9 in other patients. Warfarin prescription in patients prone to fall who had atrial fibrillation and multiple additional stroke risk factors appeared to protect against a composite endpoint of stroke, intracranial hemorrhage, myocardial infarction, and death.

Conclusion

Patients at high risk for falls with atrial fibrillation are at substantially increased risk of intracranial hemorrhage, especially traumatic intracranial hemorrhage. However, because of their high stroke rate, they appear to benefit from anticoagulant therapy if they have multiple stroke risk factors.

Aims

Atrial fibrillation patients with prior embolism have a high risk of vascular events in spite of anticoagulant therapy and elderly patients carry an additional risk. We analysed and compared vascular events-rate between older and younger than 75 years atrial fibrillation patients randomized to anticoagulant-alone or combined antiplatelet plus moderate-level anticoagulant therapy.

Methods and Results

A total of 967 patients stratified by age and the history of prior embolism were randomized to therapeutic doses of anticoagulant-alone or combined antithrombotic therapy. Primary events were fatal and non-fatal ischaemic or haemorrhagic stroke/transient ischaemic attack, systemic embolism and myocardial infarction, sudden death and death from bleeding. The elderly, compared with the younger patients, had higher event-rate [hazard ratio 2.31 (95% confidence interval 1.37–3.90), P < 0.003]. The elderly suffered higher severe bleeding event-rate during anticoagulant therapy. The combined, compared with the anticoagulant therapy, reduced the vascular events-rate in the elderly (P = 0.012) and caused less intracranial haemorrhages and less bleeding mortality, although more non-fatal gastric bleeding.

Conclusion

The elderly with AF had a higher event-rate than the younger patients. A higher severe bleeding event-rate was also registered in elderly patients receiving anticoagulant therapy. Combined, compared with anticoagulant therapy, significantly reduced vascular events and bleeding mortality in elderly patients.

Associations Between Key Patient Characteristics and OAC Discontinuation Following Occurrence of a Bleeding Event a During Follow‐up

In sensitivity analyses, we examined antithrombotic patterns following any bleeding event by stroke risk (CHA₂DS₂‑VASc < 2 versus ≥ 2) and by history of gastrointestinal bleed. OAC discontinuation rates were similar by stroke risk, with the majority of patients on dual therapy or OAC only persisting on their pre‐event therapeutic regimens following the bleed (Table S1). Similar proportions of patients who were on dual therapy before the bleeding event remained on dual therapy after the bleeding event, for patients with and without a history of gastrointestinal bleed (Table S2). Among those taking OAC only before the bleeding event, a slightly higher proportion of patients without gastrointestinal bleeding history persisted on OAC only therapy following the event compared with patients who had a history of gastrointestinal bleeding (84.0% versus 78.9%, respectively). We also investigated the distribution of major bleeding event characteristics by age, race, and sex (Table S3). Although white patients were more likely to experience a fall in hemoglobin than nonwhite patients, and we observed some differences in bleeding site by age, the majority of event characteristics were similar by demographic subgroups.

### A review of anticoagulation with warfarin in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation [^114SdxRK]. Clinical Therapeutics (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Warfarin therapy has proved safe and effective in a number of randomized controlled trials of stroke prophylaxis in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF), reducing the risk of stroke in these patients by two thirds. However, participants in the clinical trials were carefully selected and younger than patients in actual clinical practice.

Objective

This analysis sought to determine whether the results of clinical trials in patients with NV can be extrapolated to the general population seen in clinical practice.

Methods

A MEDLINE search from 1966 to the present was used to identify observational trials of anticoagulation in patients with NVAF that addressed warfarin use, anticoagulation control, efficacy, and complications. The search terms used were atrial fibrillation and anticoagulation.

Results

Although warfarin prophylaxis against stroke in patients with NVAF appeared to be as well tolerated and effective in clinical practice as in clinical trials, it was generally underused, particularly in the elderly. Anticoagulation control was not as good in clinical practice as in clinical trials, although the rates of stroke and major bleeding were comparable.

Conclusions

Judicious use of warfarin, tailored to individual stroke risk, seems to be a reasonable policy. Warfarin therapy increases quality-adjusted survival in patients at high risk for stroke, and it is recommended for medium-risk patients unless their risk of bleeding is high or their quality of life while taking warfarin would be poor. Patients at a low risk for stroke will have equivalent health outcomes and incur lower costs if treated with aspirin. Despite the increased risk of hemorrhage in elderly patients, the net benefit of warfarin therapy is greater in this age group because of the higher risk of stroke. Active involvement of patients and their caregivers in an anticoagulation service setting may improve outcomes of anticoagulation therapy.

### Effectiveness and safety of apixaban, dabigatran, and rivaroxaban versus warfarin in frail patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation [^112rVwFE]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Frail patients with NVAF are less likely to receive anticoagulation than non‐frail patients. 4, 5, 6 Perera and colleagues 4 demonstrated frailty, identified using the Edmonton Frail Scale, was among the strongest predictors of anticoagulation use in older patients with NVAF admitted to the hospital. In their prospective study of 220 acute inpatients ≥ 70 years old with NVAF, they found frail patients were significantly less likely to receive warfarin than non‐frail patients on admission and at hospital discharge (odds ratio = 0.34, 95% CI = 0.17–0.68). This is despite the fact that frailty trended towards being a predictor of increased stroke occurrence at 6 months (odds ratio = 3.39, 95% CI = 0.96–12.02; P = 0.06). 4 Similarly, the Frailty, Stroke Risk and Bleeding Risk on Anticoagulation in the Elderly With Atrial Fibrillation (FRAIL‐AF) study showed that patients classified as non‐to‐moderately frail using the Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) were 3.4‐fold (P < 0.0001) more likely to receive anticoagulation therapy than patients classified as severely frail (CFS ≥ 7). 6 Studies have shown cognitive dysfunction or dementia, perceived fall risk and advancing age, each of which are included in the Johns Hopkins Claims‐based Frailty Indicator, to be associated with a significant reduction in the odds of anticoagulation use in NVAF patients. 20, 21 Furthermore, some clinicians have supported utilizing certain OACs, or reduced doses of OACs in various clinical scenarios often associated with a frail state (eg, > 75 years old, renal impairment). 7 The fact that our evaluations of DOACs in frail NVAF patients are generally consistent with the overall study population findings from phase III randomized trials of DOACs versus warfarin, 22 may provide clinicians with added confidence in anticoagulating frail patients with NVAF.

### 2023 ACC / AHA / ACCP / HRS guideline for the diagnosis and management of atrial fibrillation: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^116BpMDt]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Bleeding risk scores and anticoagulation decision-making — Unless an absolute contraindication to anticoagulation is present, bleeding risk scores have limitation in clinical decision-making because the most commonly used scores (HAS–BLED, HEMORR2HAGES, and ATRIA) are based on clinical factors that indicate higher risks of both stroke and bleeding, and patients with higher risk of bleeding also tend to have a higher risk of stroke. Furthermore, a bleeding risk score cannot be interpreted in isolation because it does not assess the net clinical benefit of anticoagulation or balance the risk of bleeding against the risk of stroke. Population-based studies suggest that the benefits of stroke prevention with anticoagulation generally outweigh the risks of bleeding, even in patients determined to be at high risk for bleeding. Decision-making about oral anticoagulation should be based on consideration of both benefits and harms, not by using bleeding risk scores in isolation, and the best utility of these scores may be identifying potential modifying risk factors.

### Risk of bleeding with 2 doses of dabigatran compared with warfarin in older and younger patients with atrial fibrillation: an analysis of the randomized evaluation of long-term anticoagulant therapy (RE-LY) trial [^113yWVCw]. Circulation (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Dabigatran 150 and 110 mg twice a day and warfarin are effective for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation. The purpose of this study was to compare their risks of bleeding in the Randomized Evaluation of Long-Term Anticoagulant Therapy (RE-LY) trial.

Methods and Results

The RE-LY trial randomized 18 113 patients to receive dabigatran 110 or 150 mg twice a day or warfarin dose adjusted to an international normalized ratio of 2.0 to 3.0 for a median follow-up of 2.0 years. Compared with warfarin, dabigatran 110 mg twice a day was associated with a lower risk of major bleeding (2.87% versus 3.57%; P = 0.002), whereas dabigatran 150 mg twice a day was associated with a similar risk of major bleeding (3.31% versus 3.57%; P = 0.32). There was a significant treatment-by-age interaction, such that dabigatran 110 mg twice a day compared with warfarin was associated with a lower risk of major bleeding in patients aged < 75 years (1.89% versus 3.04%; P < 0.001) and a similar risk in those aged ≥ 75 years (4.43% versus 4.37%; P = 0.89; P for interaction < 0.001), whereas dabigatran 150 mg twice a day compared with warfarin was associated with a lower risk of major bleeding in those aged < 75 years (2.12% versus 3.04%; P < 0.001) and a trend toward higher risk of major bleeding in those aged ≥ 75 years (5.10% versus 4.37%; P = 0.07; P for interaction < 0.001). The interaction with age was evident for extracranial bleeding, but not for intracranial bleeding, with the risk of the latter being consistently reduced with dabigatran compared with warfarin irrespective of age.

Conclusions

In patients with atrial fibrillation at risk for stroke, both doses of dabigatran compared with warfarin have lower risks of both intracranial and extracranial bleeding in patients aged < 75 years. In those aged ≥ 75 years, intracranial bleeding risk is lower but extracranial bleeding risk is similar or higher with both doses of dabigatran compared with warfarin.

Atrial fibrillation — bleeding risk assessment highlights that anticoagulation increases the risk of bleeding, so patients with AF are generally evaluated for bleeding risk as part of decision-making. Currently used bleeding risk scores — HAS-BLED, HEMORR2HAGES, and ATRIA — with listed components such as age ≥ 65 years, older age [≥ 75 years], and elderly age ≥ 75 years, discriminate poorly between patients with and without an increased risk of bleeding and include many nonspecific factors that predict an increased risk of stroke as well as an increased risk of bleeding. Assessment of factors that specifically predict an increased risk of bleeding without predicting an increased risk of stroke is more helpful when balancing risks and benefits of anticoagulation.

### CHADS-VASc and has-BLED scores do not accurately stratify risk for stroke or bleed in fall victims with atrial fibrillation [^117KMVSH]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Falls are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the elderly. Non-valvular Atrial fibrillation (AF) is present in up to 9% of this group and often requires oral anticoagulation (OAC). The CHA₂DS₂-VASc and HAS-BLED scores are validated tools assessing risk of ischemic stroke from AF and major bleeding (MB) from OAC. It is unclear if these predictions remain accurate in post-fall patients. This study seeks to determine the stroke and major bleeding rate in atrial fibrillation patients after a ground level fall and identify if validated risk scoring systems accurately stratify risk in this cohort.

Methods

Retrospective review of patients with AF presented to the emergency department after a fall. CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc and HAS-BLED scores were calculated. Follow up information was reviewed to 1 year. Patients were grouped according to discharge thromboprophylaxis plan (DTP): no treatment, Anti-platelet (AP), OAC, and AP + OAC. Outcomes were ischemic stroke, MB, or death at 1 year. Ischemic stroke and MB rates were calculated. Kruskal-Wallis, Χ 2, Fisher's exact, and multivariable logistic regression were used to evaluate for clinical associations.

Results

192 patients were included. MB rate was 14.5 bleeds/100 person-years, and ischemic stroke rate was 10.9/100 person-years. There were no observed differences between DTPs. Overall, one-year mortality was 22.1%. On unadjusted analysis, CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc did associate with ischemic stroke (p = 0.03); HAS-BLED did not associate with MB (p = 0.17). After logistic regression accounting for known risk factors, neither system associated with ischemic stroke or MB.

Conclusions

Fall patients are at higher risk for both ischemic stroke and MB compared to previously published reports. Current risk assessment tools should be used with caution. Further study of risk factors is warranted to guide medication decisions in these patients.

### Very elderly patients with atrial fibrillation treated with edoxaban: impact of frailty on outcomes [^115Er5sS]. JACC: Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

The risk of atrial fibrillation (AF) increases with advancing age and is associated with cardiovascular disease, risk factor burden, and frailty. AF significantly increases the risk of stroke in the presence of risk factors. The risk of stroke increases significantly with age, especially in the very elderly aged 80 years and above. Anticoagulation significantly reduces stroke risk, with the recommended doses of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) offering a better net clinical benefit in terms of lower incidence of stroke, death, and intracranial hemorrhage with no difference in major bleeding. Hence, very elderly patients would benefit most from anticoagulation but are paradoxically less likely treated with these drugs with one of the most common reasons for oral anticoagulation deter being frailty. Frailty has not been specifically evaluated in DOAC registration trials and postmarketing observational cohorts. However, treatment with edoxaban provided an even greater absolute net clinical benefit in the elderly, and in vulnerable patient subgroups. Frailty is a complex condition generally attributed to age, but which in reality only partly overlaps with it. Given the lack of a universally accepted standardized definition of frailty, it leaves much to the subjective perception of the physician making the assessment. Indeed, cardiologists subjectively identify phenotypic frailty in the presence of problems with walking, cognition, malnutrition, sarcopenia, sex, and age. Several clinical frailty assessment tools have been developed but, due to complexity, are hardly used in the routine outpatient assessment of AF. One tool, SHARE-FI (Survey of Health, Ageing, and Retirement in Europe–Frailty Index), may be suitable for use in AF setting. Frailty plays an important role in AF management decision-making, and despite not being part of anticoagulation risk assessment scores, it impacts decision mostly leading to underdosing. Since frail very elderly patients are underrepresented in randomized controlled trials, evidence may not necessarily be translated to this population. Broad registry data coming from routine clinical practice show that edoxaban is initiated mainly in older patients, who are often anticoagulation-naïve patients with AF. Although DOACs have shown a clear net clinical outcome over warfarin in all age categories in registration randomized clinical trials, it is currently unclear whether these results can be replicated in patients with AF not meeting the inclusion/exclusion criteria of these trials, such as frail patients.

The aim of this study was to evaluate clinical outcomes in very elderly patients with AF treated with recommended doses of edoxaban and look for a possible relation with frailty as evaluated by a reproducible score.

### Bleeding risk scores in atrial fibrillation: helpful or harmful? [^112GQz3Z]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

The reasons for the lack of clinical impact by bleeding risks scores is partially because of the parallel nature of bleeding risk scores and stroke risk scores such as CHA2DS2‐VASc (Congestive heart failure, Hypertension, Age, Diabetes Mellitus, Prior Stroke, Vascular disease, Sex category). 11 For example, with increasing age, the risk of stroke and major bleeding increase. Because a bleeding risk score can help justify withholding anticoagulation from a high‐risk patient, they may actually harm patients. This editorial will further discuss the reasons why previously developed bleeding risk scoring systems, such as HAS‐BLED and GARFIELD‐AF, have minimal clinical impact, especially in modern anticoagulation therapy.

First, the net clinical benefit of anticoagulation in patients with AF has been studied. Friberg and colleagues showed that increased thromboembolism risk was associated with increased risk of bleeding, likely because many of the risk factors involved in the risk stratification scores overlap. 11 In this study, the only patients who did not benefit from anticoagulation were patients with a CHA2DS2VASc score of 0 or 1, patients in whom anticoagulation is not recommended by either the European Society of Cardiology or AHA/ACC/HRS guidelines. 1, 10, 11 In fact, a patient with a CHA2DS2VASc score of 5 and an HAS‐BLED score of 5 would have a net clinical benefit of 3% per year even when weighting intracranial hemorrhage as 1.5 times the clinical impact of a stroke. 11 In a study by Oleson and colleagues, bleeding risk does increase with higher HAS‐BLED scores. 12 However, net clinical benefit, measured in deaths or hospitalizations for thromboembolism or bleeding, significantly favored warfarin in all patients with a CHA2DS2VASc score > 1. 12 Thus, even when accounting for bleeding risk, warfarin therapy would provide net clinical benefit to those in whom guidelines recommend anticoagulation. The risk is that despite guideline statements to the contrary, bleeding risk scores could be used to justify withholding therapy from high‐risk patients, which places patients at risk of stroke.

### Mortality after ground-level fall in the elderly patient taking oral anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation / flutter: a long-term analysis of risk versus benefit [^112Zin9g]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Elderly patients with atrial fibrillation or flutter who experience ground-level falls are at risk for lethal head injuries. Patients on oral anticoagulation (OAC) for thromboprophylaxis may be at higher risk for these head injuries. Trauma surgeons treating these patients face a difficult choice: (1) continue OAC to minimize stroke risk while increasing the risk of a lethal head injury or (2) discontinue OAC to avoid intracranial hemorrhage while increasing the risk of stroke. To inform this choice, we conducted a retrospective cohort study to assess long-term outcomes and risk factors for mortality after presentation with a ground-level fall among patients with and without OAC.

Methods

Retrospective analysis of the longitudinal version of the California Office of Statewide Planning and Development database was performed for years 1995 to 2009. Elderly anticoagulated patients (age > 65 years) with known atrial fibrillation or flutter who fell were stratified by CHA2DS2-VASc score and compared with a nonanticoagulated control cohort. Multivariable logistic regression including patient demographics, stroke risk, injury severity, and hospital type identified risk factors for mortality.

Results

A total of 377,873 patient records met the inclusion criteria, 42,913 on OAC and 334,960 controls. The mean age was 82.4 and 80.6 years, respectively. Most were female, with CHA2DS2-VASc scores between 3 and 5. Mortality among OAC patients after a first fall was 6%, compared with 3.1% among non-OAC patients. Patients dying with a head injury constituted 31.6% of deaths within OAC patients compared with 23.8% among controls. Risk of eventual death with head injury exceeded annualized stroke risk for patients with CHA2DS2-VASc scores of 0 to 2. Predictors for mortality with head injury on the first admission included male sex, Asian ethnicity, a history of stroke, and trauma center admission.

Conclusion

Elderly patients on OAC for atrial fibrillation and/or flutter who fall have a greater risk for mortality compared with controls. Patients with low CHA2DS2-VASc scores (0–3) at high risk for falls with identified risk factors should speak to their prescribing physicians regarding the risk/benefits of continued use of OAC.

### Antithrombotic therapy for atrial fibrillation: antithrombotic therapy and prevention of thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^113sdNQn]. Chest (2012). Medium credibility.

Bleeding risk assessment in AF — use of bleeding scores and decision-making: The guideline states it has not made separate recommendations by patient bleeding risk because data are insufficient to estimate absolute bleeding rates across regimens; several bleeding risk scores have been evaluated but have not been extensively validated, showing modest discrimination with comparable C statistics (range, 0.61–0.66); in scenarios with weak recommendations in favor of oral anticoagulation (e.g. CHADS2 score 0), patients at high risk of major bleeding may decline oral anticoagulation therapy.

### Stroke, bleeding, and mortality risks in elderly Medicare beneficiaries treated with dabigatran or rivaroxaban for nonvalvular atrial fibrillation [^115shhUW]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Importance

Dabigatran and rivaroxaban are non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants approved for stroke prevention in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (AF). There are no randomized head-to-head comparisons of these drugs for stroke, bleeding, or mortality outcomes.

Objective

To compare risks of thromboembolic stroke, intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), major extracranial bleeding including major gastrointestinal bleeding, and mortality in patients with nonvalvular AF who initiated dabigatran or rivaroxaban treatment for stroke prevention.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Retrospective new-user cohort study of 118 891 patients with nonvalvular AF who were 65 years or older, enrolled in fee-for-service Medicare, and who initiated treatment with dabigatran or rivaroxaban from November 4, 2011, through June 30, 2014. Differences in baseline characteristics were adjusted using stabilized inverse probability of treatment weights based on propensity scores. The data analysis was performed from May 7, 2015, through June 30, 2016.

Exposures

Dabigatran, 150 mg, twice daily; rivaroxaban, 20 mg, once daily.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for the primary outcomes of thromboembolic stroke, ICH, major extracranial bleeding including major gastrointestinal bleeding, and mortality, with dabigatran as reference. Adjusted incidence rate differences (AIRDs) were also estimated.

Results

A total of 52 240 dabigatran-treated and 66 651 rivaroxaban-treated patients (47% female) contributed 15 524 and 20 199 person-years of on-treatment follow-up, respectively, during which 2537 primary outcome events occurred. Rivaroxaban use was associated with a statistically nonsignificant reduction in thromboembolic stroke (HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.65–1.01; p = 0.07; AIRD = 1.8 fewer cases/1000 person-years), statistically significant increases in ICH (HR, 1.65; 95% CI, 1.20–2.26; p = 0.002; AIRD = 2.3 excess cases/1000 person-years) and major extracranial bleeding (HR, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.32–1.67; P < .001; AIRD = 13.0 excess cases/1000 person-years), including major gastrointestinal bleeding (HR, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.23–1.59; P < .001; AIRD = 9.4 excess cases/1000 person-years), and with a statistically nonsignificant increase in mortality (HR, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.00–1.32; p = 0.051; AIRD = 3.1 excess cases/1000 person-years). In patients 75 years or older or with CHADS2 score greater than 2, rivaroxaban use was associated with significantly increased mortality compared with dabigatran use. The excess rate of ICH with rivaroxaban use exceeded its reduced rate of thromboembolic stroke.

Conclusions and Relevance

Treatment with rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily was associated with statistically significant increases in ICH and major extracranial bleeding, including major gastrointestinal bleeding, compared with dabigatran 150 mg twice daily.

### Changes in anticoagulant utilization among United States nursing home residents with atrial fibrillation from 2011 to 2016 [^111oVd1W]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Low use of anticoagulation was widespread despite evidence supporting clinical benefit. A meta‐analysis of clinical trials comparing warfarin with control reported a 64% risk reduction for stroke and comparable risk for major extracranial hemorrhage in patients with AF. 34 Similar findings were reported for warfarin versus aspirin among older adults aged > 75 years. 7 Prominent reasons clinicians refrain from anticoagulation among high‐risk older adults post‐stroke include perceived fall risk, poor prognosis, and a history of bleeding. 4, 5 Considering a history of falls is common among nursing home residents, coupled with a high burden of cognitive impairment 14 and short‐life expectancy, 15 it is reasonable to expect a lower prevalence of anticoagulation compared with community‐dwelling populations. Interestingly, although the prevalence of bleeding risk factors was directionally consistent with greater provider caution in treating patients with higher bleeding risk, more than half of the untreated population had low bleeding risk (ATRIA < 4) and more than three quarters did not have a recent history of falls. This suggests a role for other factors beyond these commonly reported reasons for not prescribing oral anticoagulants. In this respect, our findings were similar to earlier studies in the nursing home setting which reported lower likelihood of preventative treatment for residents with cognitive impairment in addition to atrial fibrillation 32 or prior myocardial infarction. 35 However, existing functional limitations did not appear to deter anticoagulant use in our study population, as treated fractions were generally consistent across levels of functional limitation.

### Outcomes and disease management in patients with atrial fibrillation ≥ 80 Years: data from a consecutive 11-year real-world registry [^115ZrL64]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Third, our study observed no significant differences in the predefined outcome parameters between VKA and DOAC strategies among patients aged ≥ 80 years, prompting reconsideration of the optimal OAC approach in this subgroup. Although DOAC therapy showed favorable HR profile for stroke and major bleeding events, evidence regarding the effectiveness and safety of DOAC regimens in older patients with AF remains limited. The percentage of patients ≥ 75 years included in randomized clinical trials is substantially limited, ranging from 31% in ARISTOTLE (Apixaban for Reduction in Stroke and Other Thromboembolic Events in Atrial Fibrillation)to 44% in ROCKET AF (Rivaroxaban Once Daily Oral Direct Factor Xa Inhibition Compared With Vitamin K Antagonism for Prevention of Stroke and Embolism Trial in Atrial Fibrillation). Most evidence is derived from subgroup analyses or meta‐analyses from representative randomized clinical trials. However, it is noteworthy that older patients included in randomized clinical trials tend to exhibit relatively better health profiles, fewer comorbidities, and improved physical function compared with older adults in the general population. Thus, comparing our trial in the setting of an ED with these previous studies poses challenges due to the limited representation of frail older patients in the 4 pivotal DOAC trials. These patients were often excluded because of high anticipated bleeding risks or were overlooked by physicians, leading to underrepresentation of older patients with AF in current clinical trials. Moreover, prior analyses primarily assessed frailty through comorbidities and polypharmacy, overlooking broader aspects inherent in the clinical syndrome. Our findings additionally indicate that among patients aged ≥ 80 years, both apixaban (HR, 0.67; P < 0.001) and rivaroxaban (HR, 0.54; P < 0.001) were significantly associated with a lower hazard of the primary composite end point compared with patients without an oral anticoagulation. However, the direct comparison between apixaban and rivaroxaban did not show a statistically significant difference (P = 0.155), suggesting that both DOACs provide similar protective effects in this age group. This reinforces the evidence that DOACs are effective alternatives to no anticoagulation in older patients with AF, despite the known frailty and comorbid conditions that characterize this population. However, the lack of significant differences between DOAC and VKA strategies in our study suggests that specific characteristics of the older population, such as increased frailty, multiple comorbidities, and polypharmacy, may limit the relative benefit of DOACs over VKAs in this age group. These factors can influence both the pharmacokinetics and safety profile of DOACs, potentially reducing their effectiveness compared with VKAs. This highlights the need for a more personalized anticoagulation approach in patients aged ≥ 80 years, taking into consideration individual bleeding risks and overall health status.

### Antithrombotic therapy for atrial fibrillation: antithrombotic therapy and prevention of thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^116SGXZT]. Chest (2012). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation — intermediate stroke risk (CHADS₂ score = 1) management: For patients with AF, including those with paroxysmal AF, who are at intermediate risk of stroke (eg, CHADS2 score = 1), "we recommend oral anticoagulation rather than no therapy (Grade 1B)". The guideline also states "We suggest oral anticoagulation rather than aspirin (75 mg to 325 mg once daily) (Grade 2B) or combination therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel (Grade 2B)". Quantified 1-year effects for vitamin K antagonist (VKA) therapy include, versus no therapy, "five fewer deaths and 15 fewer nonfatal strokes per 1,000 patients at the cost of eight more nonfatal major extracranial bleeds"; versus aspirin, VKA is anticipated to "prevent nine nonfatal strokes for every 1,000 patients treated for 1 year compared with aspirin but will result in three additional bleeds and no reduction in all-cause mortality"; and versus aspirin plus clopidogrel, VKA is expected to result in "six fewer nonfatal strokes per 1,000 patients over a 1-year period, anywhere from four fewer to three more nonfatal major extracranial bleeds, and no reduction in all-cause mortality". For patients unsuitable for or choosing not to take an oral anticoagulant for reasons other than concerns about major bleeding, such as "difficulty maintaining a stable INR, lifestyle limitations of regular INR monitoring, dietary restrictions that are too burdensome, or costs of new anticoagulant drugs that are too high", the text states that combination aspirin and clopidogrel "provides additional benefit of stroke reduction at the cost of additional bleeding" and that they "should be informed that they are choosing an inferior treatment with regard to stroke prevention".

### Thromboprophylaxis of elderly patients with AF in the UK: an analysis using the general practice research database (GPRD) 2000–2009 [^112VS48X]. Heart (2013). Low credibility.

This study found that in the UK, women with AF are less likely to be prescribed warfarin than men with the same risk factors for stroke, even though female sex has been associated with increased risk of stroke in AF. This is consistent with findings in Scotland that women with AF were 25% less likely to receive warfarin than men, and a Canadian study which showed that women were 54% less likely to receive warfarin, but only in the subgroup of patients aged ≥ 75 years. However, a more recent Canadian study found no evidence of reduced usage of warfarin in women compared with men.

It is difficult to explain the disparity of use of anticoagulation in women as compared with men. Gender inequalities have been observed in use of therapies in other areas of cardiovascular medicine. These have been attributed to a possible perceived lower risk of cardiovascular disease in women compared with men, leading to under-recording of risk factors and lower rates of prophylactic treatment in women. It may be that the same factors apply in the use of anticoagulation in patients with AF.

The factors that determine whether warfarin is prescribed in clinical practice are complex, and our study was not designed to investigate the reasons behind clinical decision making. Physicians often avoid anticoagulation in elderly patients due to fear of bleeding, fall risk, non-adherence and monitoring concerns. While the efficacy of warfarin in stroke prevention is established, warfarin has many limitations, including a narrow therapeutic index, slow onset and offset of action, multiple drug and food interactions, and a requirement for close laboratory monitoring of coagulation via the International Normalised Ratio (INR) and subsequent dose adjustments. Close monitoring necessitates regular clinic visits with increased financial burden and inconvenience to patients; thus, many eligible patients choose not to use warfarin. However, patient education and self-monitoring may promote better compliance and INR control among elderly patients with AF.

### Stroke and major bleeding risk in elderly patients aged ≥ 75 years with atrial fibrillation: the loire valley atrial fibrillation project [^114xwBHV]. Stroke (2015). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is increasingly prevalent in the elderly, but such patients tend to be under-represented in clinical trials. Increasing age confers a higher risk of stroke and bleeding when antithrombotic therapy is used. We examined risk factors for stroke and bleeding among elderly (age, > 75 years) patients within a real world hospitalized cohort from the Loire Valley AF project.

Methods

We identified elderly (age, > 75 years) patients with AF, assessed their risk factors, and followed up for stroke, thromboembolism, death, or major bleeding. The effect of vitamin K antagonist (VKA) use on these end points was assessed.

Results

We studied 8962 patients with AF, and we identified 4130 elderly (age, ≥ 75 years) patients. Using Kaplan-Meier analyses, event rates of death, stroke/thromboembolism, the composite of stroke/thromboembolism/death, and major bleeding increased with increasing age. For mortality, VKA-treated patients did better than non-VKA-treated patients. The risk of death and stroke/thromboembolism/death increased with increasing age. The risk of major bleeding did not increase with increasing age strata. VKA treatment was associated with lower mortality in those aged < 75 years (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 0.57; 95% confidence interval, 0.45–0.72), and the effect size was maintained with increasing age strata (Pint = 0.67). For stroke/thromboembolism/death, VKA also has a significant benefit in those aged < 75 years (adjusted HR, 0.69; [0.57–0.83]), and the effect size was maintained with increasing age strata (Pint = 0.58). For major bleeding, there was no statistically significant difference between age strata (Pint = 0.67). In elderly patients, age and previous stroke emerged as the main predictors of stroke and thromboembolism. Renal impairment and VKA use were predictors of major bleeding.

Conclusions

Elderly patients with AF have a higher risk of stroke and bleeding, but the benefits of VKA therapy for stroke/thromboembolism or mortality were present regardless of increasing age.

### Oral anticoagulant therapy in atrial fibrillation patients at high stroke and bleeding risk [^112yn9Cq]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is associated with a 5-fold greater risk of ischemic stroke or systemic embolism compared with normal sinus rhythm. Cardioembolic AF-related strokes are often more severe, fatal or associated with greater permanent disability and higher recurrence rates than strokes of other aetiologies. These strokes may be effectively prevented with oral anticoagulant (OAC) therapy, using either vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) or non-vitamin K antagonist OACs (NOACs) such as the direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran or direct factor Xa inhibitors rivaroxaban, apixaban or edoxaban. Most AF patients have a positive net clinical benefit from OAC, excluding those with AF and no conventional stroke risk factors. Balancing the risks of stroke and bleeding is necessary for optimal use of OAC in clinical practice, and modifiable bleeding risk factors must be addressed. Concerns remain over 'non-changeable' bleeding risk factors such as older age, significant renal or hepatic impairment, prior stroke(s) or prior bleeding event(s) and active malignancies. Such AF patients are often termed 'special' AF populations, due to their 'special' risk profile that includes increased risks of both thromboembolic and bleeding events, and due to fear of bleeding complications these AF patients are often denied OAC. Evidence shows, however, that the absolute benefits of OAC are the greatest in patients at the highest risk, and NOACs may offer even a greater net clinical benefit compared to warfarin particularly in these high risk patients. In this review article, we summarize available data on stroke prevention in AF patients at increased risk of both stroke and bleeding and discuss the use of NOACs for thromboprophylaxis in these 'special' AF populations.

### Efficacy and safety of rivaroxaban compared with warfarin among elderly patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation in the rivaroxaban once daily, oral, direct factor Xa inhibition compared with vitamin K antagonism for prevention of stroke and embolism trial in atrial fibrillation (ROCKET AF) [^112XcbWZ]. Circulation (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Nonvalvular atrial fibrillation is common in elderly patients, who face an elevated risk of stroke but difficulty sustaining warfarin treatment. The oral factor Xa inhibitor rivaroxaban was noninferior to warfarin in the Rivaroxaban Once Daily, Oral, Direct Factor Xa Inhibition Compared With Vitamin K Antagonism for Prevention of Stroke and Embolism Trial in Atrial Fibrillation (ROCKET AF). This prespecified secondary analysis compares outcomes in older and younger patients.

Methods and Results

There were 6229 patients (44%) aged ≥ 75 years with atrial fibrillation and ≥ 2 stroke risk factors randomized to warfarin (target international normalized ratio = 2.0–3.0) or rivaroxaban (20 mg daily; 15 mg if creatinine clearance < 50 mL/min), double blind. The primary end point was stroke and systemic embolism by intention to treat. Over 10 866 patient-years, older participants had more primary events (2.57% versus 2.05%/100 patient-years; P = 0.0068) and major bleeding (4.63% versus 2.74%/100 patient-years; P < 0.0001). Stroke/systemic embolism rates were consistent among older (2.29% rivaroxaban versus 2.85% warfarin per 100 patient-years; hazard ratio = 0.80; 95% confidence interval, 0.63–1.02) and younger patients (2.00% versus 2.10%/100 patient-years; hazard ratio = 0.95; 95% confidence interval, 0.76–1.19; interaction P = 0.313), as were major bleeding rates (≥ 75 years: 4.86% rivaroxaban versus 4.40% warfarin per 100 patient-years; hazard ratio = 1.11; 95% confidence interval, 0.92–1.34; < 75 years: 2.69% versus 2.79%/100 patient-years; hazard ratio = 0.96; 95% confidence interval, 0.78–1.19; interaction P = 0.336). Hemorrhagic stroke rates were similar in both age groups; there was no interaction between age and rivaroxaban response.

Conclusions

Elderly patients had higher stroke and major bleeding rates than younger patients, but the efficacy and safety of rivaroxaban relative to warfarin did not differ with age, supporting rivaroxaban as an alternative for the elderly.

### Bleeding risk during oral anticoagulation in atrial fibrillation patients older than 80 years [^114ScEjM]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

Objectives

We sought to evaluate the rate of bleeding in relation to age (< 80 and ≥ 80 years), the quality of anticoagulation (expressed as time spent in international normalized ratio therapeutic range), and factors associated with bleeding events.

Background

Stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) is an increasingly crucial public health target, particularly in patients ages ≥ 80 years.

Methods

We conducted a prospective observational study on 783 patients with AF on oral anticoagulant treatment (OAT).

Results

Patients spent a median 14%, 71%, and 15% of time below, within, and above the intended therapeutic range, respectively. No difference in OAT quality was found between patients age < 80 and ≥ 80 years. During follow-up, 94 patients experienced bleeding complications (rate 3.7 x 100 patient/years), 37 major (rate 1.4 x 100 patient/years), and 57 minor (rate 2.2 x 100 patient/years). Different rates of major hemorrhage were observed between patients age < 80 and ≥ 80 years (0.9 vs. 1.9 x 100 patient/years; p = 0.004). Bleeding risk also was greater in patients with a history of previous cerebral ischemic event (odds ratio [OR]: 2.5; 95% confidence interval: 1.3 to 4.8; p = 0.007). A Cox regression analysis confirmed age ≥ 80 years associated with bleeding risk (OR: 2.0).

Conclusions

These results indicate that the rate of major bleeding complications may be kept acceptably low also in very elderly AF patients on OAT, provided a careful management of anticoagulation is obtained.

Table 12 — Bleeding endpoints and oral anticoagulation reporting for AF ablation trials specify ISTH-based thresholds and documentation. Major bleeding is defined as fatal bleeding and/or symptomatic bleeding in a critical area or organ with listed sites, and/or bleeding causing a fall in hemoglobin level of 2 g/dL (1.24 mmol/L) or more, or leading to transfusion of one or more units of blood. Clinically relevant nonmajor bleed is an acute or subacute clinically overt bleed that does not meet the criteria for a major bleed but prompts a clinical response such as hospital admission for bleeding, physician-guided medical or surgical treatment for bleeding, or change in antithrombotic therapy (including interruption or discontinuation). Minor bleeding is defined as all nonmajor bleeds. Incidence and discontinuation of oral anticoagulation should include documentation of the number and type at end of follow-up and, if discontinued, the number discontinuing, timing, reasons, and patients' clinical characteristics and stroke risk profile.

### Predicting major bleeding in ischemic stroke patients with atrial fibrillation [^116cooVS]. Stroke (2017). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Performance of risk scores for major bleeding in patients with atrial fibrillation and a previous transient ischemic attack or ischemic stroke is not well established. We aimed to validate risk scores for major bleeding in patients with atrial fibrillation treated with oral anticoagulants after cerebral ischemia and explore the net benefit of oral anticoagulants among bleeding risk categories.

Methods

We analyzed 3623 patients with a history of transient ischemic attack or stroke included in the RE-LY trial (Randomized Evaluation of Long-Term Anticoagulation Therapy). We assessed performance of HEMORR 2 HAGES (hepatic or renal disease, ethanol abuse, malignancy, older age, reduced platelet count or function, hypertension [uncontrolled], anemia, genetic factors, excessive fall risk, and stroke), Shireman, HAS-BLED (hypertension, abnormal renal/liver function, stroke, bleeding history or predisposition, labile international normalized ratio, elderly, drugs/alcohol concomitantly), ATRIA (Anticoagulation and Risk Factors in Atrial Fibrillation), and ORBIT scores (older age, reduced haemoglobin/haematocrit/history of anaemia, bleeding history, insufficient kidney function, and treatment with antiplatelet) with C statistics and calibration plots. Net benefit of oral anticoagulants was explored by comparing risk reduction in ischemic stroke with risk increase in major bleedings on warfarin.

Results

During 6922 person-years of follow-up, 266 patients experienced a major bleed (3.8 per 100 person-years). C statistics ranged from 0.62 (Shireman) to 0.67 (ATRIA). Calibration was poor for ATRIA and moderate for other models. The reduction in recurrent ischemic strokes on warfarin was larger than the increase in major bleeding risk, irrespective of bleeding risk category.

Conclusions

Performance of prediction models for major bleeding in patients with cerebral ischemia and atrial fibrillation is modest but comparable with performance in patients with only atrial fibrillation. Bleeding risk scores cannot guide treatment decisions for oral anticoagulants but may still be useful to identify modifiable risk factors for bleeding. Clinical usefulness may be best for ORBIT, which is based on a limited number of easily obtainable variables and showed reasonable performance.

### Geriatric conditions are associated with decreased anticoagulation use in long-term care residents with atrial fibrillation [^112T1w3A]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Anticoagulation is the mainstay for stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation, but concerns about bleeding inhibit its use in residents of long‐term care facilities. Risk‐profiling algorithms using comorbid disease information (eg, CHADS 2 and ATRIA [Anticoagulation and Risk Factors in Atrial Fibrillation]) have been available for years. In the long‐term care setting, however, providers and residents may place more value on geriatric conditions such as mobility impairment, activities of daily living dependency, cognitive impairment, low body mass index, weight loss, and fall history.

Methods and Results

Using a retrospective cohort design, we measured the association between geriatric conditions and anticoagulation use and type. After merging nursing home assessments containing information about geriatric conditions (Minimum Data Set 2015) with Medicare Part A 2014 to 2015 claims and prescription claims (Medicare Part D) 2015 to 2016, we identified 228 741 residents with atrial fibrillation and elevated stroke risk (CHA₂DS₂‑VASc score ≥ 2) for our main analysis. Recent fall, activities of daily living dependency, moderate and severe cognitive impairment, low body mass index, and unintentional weight loss were all associated with lower anticoagulation use even after adjustment for multiple predictors of stroke and bleeding (odds ratios ranging from 0.51 to 0.91). Residents with recent fall, low body mass index, and unintentional weight loss were more likely to be using a direct oral anticoagulant, although the magnitude of this effect was smaller.

Conclusions

Geriatric conditions were associated with lower anticoagulation use. Preventing stroke in these residents with potential for further physical and cognitive impairment would appear to be of paramount significance, although the net benefit of anticoagulation in these individuals warrants further research.

### Importance of considering competing risks in time-to-event analyses: application to stroke risk in a retrospective cohort study of elderly patients with atrial fibrillation [^116rZ4V2]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2018). Low credibility.

An important observation is that the observed incidence of stroke in our cohort is lower than anticipated from the seminal studies reporting on the heightened risk of stroke in patients with AF. – The 5-year cumulative incidence of stroke was only 5.4% (95% CI, 5.3%–5.5%), despite 47% of the cohort not filling a single prescription for warfarin in the 90 days after the index date. Based on a median CHADS₂ score of 2 and CHA₂DS₂ VASc score of 4, the expected stroke incidence is 4% per year. This is consistent with other reports on the decreasing risk of stroke associated with AF over the past 20 years, even among nonanticoagulated patients.

The decreasing stroke incidence underscores the need to reappraise which patients are expected to benefit from long-term anticoagulation for primary stroke prevention because the net benefit of anticoagulation for stroke prophylaxis was demonstrated in patients with higher event rates. A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials of warfarin in patients with AF reported 282 strokes over 8946 patient-years (≈3.1 per 100 patient-years) in antiplatelet-treated patients. A more recent meta-analysis demonstrating the benefit of direct oral anticoagulants relative to warfarin reported a stroke incidence of 3.8% over ≈2 years' median follow-up in warfarin-treated patients. Anticoagulation is currently recommended for patients with a CHA 2 DS 2 VASc score of ≥ 2, which has been reported to be associated with a 2.2% annual stroke risk. The risk-benefit balance of anticoagulation for primary prevention of stroke in patients with AF becomes more ambiguous if the absolute stroke risk is lower. Accordingly, treatment decisions about stroke prophylaxis in elderly patients today may be better aided with risk estimates that more accurately reflect contemporary absolute risk. This would require consideration of the impact of competing risks, as illustrated with our data and that of others. Competing risks would also be a relevant consideration when predicting the risk of bleeding associated with anticoagulation.

### Not all patients with atrial fibrillation-associated ischemic stroke can be started on anticoagulant therapy [^111jHRqP]. Stroke (2006). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Ischemic stroke patients in atrial fibrillation (AF) have a 10% to 20% risk of recurrent stroke. Warfarin reduces this risk by two thirds. However, warfarin is underutilized in this patient group. We performed a prospective study to determine the reasons why warfarin is not started in these patients.

Methods

All patients with AF-associated ischemic stroke over a 12-month period were identified. Demographic and other data, including whether warfarin was commenced or recommended at discharge, and if not why not, were recorded.

Results

Ninety-three of 412 (23%) ischemic stroke patients had paroxysmal or permanent AF. Of these patients, 17 (18%) died, 48 (52%) were discharged home, and 28 (30%) were discharged to institutional care. Only 13 of 64 (20%) patients with known AF were taking warfarin at stroke onset. Warfarin was started (or recommended) in 35 of 76 (46%) survivors. Of those not commenced on warfarin, 32 (78%) were dependent (P < 0.001) and 23 (56%) were discharged to institutional care (P < 0.001). Warfarin was not started because of severe disability and frailty in 13 (32%), risk of falls in 12 (30%), and limited life expectancy in 4 (10%).

Conclusions

In this cohort of patients with AF, warfarin was primarily underutilized before stroke onset, and it was too late to use anticoagulation, in approximately half, once a stroke had occurred. The decision to start or continue anticoagulation requires clinical judgment and should be made on a case by case basis after a complete risk benefit assessment.

### Efficacy and safety of direct oral anticoagulants for stroke prevention in older patients with atrial fibrillation: a network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^115ZtqFs]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Outcomes

This study's outcomes of interest included efficacy and safety outcomes. The efficacy outcome was the composite of stroke and systemic embolism. The safety outcomes were major bleeding, clinically relevant bleeding, and ICH. Major bleeding was defined in most trials according to the International Society on Thrombosis and Hemostasis definition, which includes clinically overt bleeding with any 1 of the following: (1) a decrease in the hemoglobin level of ≥ 2 g/dL; (2) requiring transfusion of ≥ 2 units of packed red cells; (3) occurring at a critical site (ie, intracranial, intraspinal, intraocular, pericardial, intra‐articular, intramuscular with compartment syndrome, or retroperitoneal); and (4) resulting in death. Clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding was defined as any clinically overt bleeding that does not meet the criteria for major bleeding but resulted in hospital admission, physician‐guided medical or surgical treatment, or a change in antithrombotic therapy (including study drug) for bleeding. ICH included hemorrhagic strokes and subdural or subarachnoid hemorrhages.

Data Extraction

Two authors (D.S.‐H.L. and J.‐K.L.) extracted data from all enrolled studies and independently assessed the bias risk for each study using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. Any discordances in the evaluation were resolved by discussion. Data were extracted using a standardized format and included the following: the trial name, the publication year, the DOAC type used in the intervention arm, the DOAC dose used in the intervention arm, the VKA type used in the control arm, the total number of patients, the major inclusion criteria of study participants, the efficacy and safety outcomes reported by the study, the follow‐up length, the participants' demographic and clinical characteristics (including age and sex), and the age strata adopted in the subgroup analyses (Table). The sample size, the number of events, and the incidence of events (per 1000 patient‐years) in each age category in each treatment arm were extracted. If the number of events was not provided in the study, the risk ratio (RR) estimates, including the hazard ratios or incidence rate ratios, and their corresponding 95% CIs were extracted.

### Efficacy and harms of direct oral anticoagulants in the elderly for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation and secondary prevention of venous thromboembolism: systematic review and meta-analysis [^116dQkud]. Circulation (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Evidence regarding the use of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) in the elderly, particularly bleeding risks, is unclear despite the presence of greater comorbidities, polypharmacy, and altered pharmacokinetics in this age group.

Methods and Results

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized trials of DOACs (dabigatran, apixaban, rivaroxaban, and edoxaban) for efficacy and bleeding outcomes in comparison with vitamin K antagonists (VKA) in elderly participants (aged ≥ 75 years) treated for acute venous thromboembolism or stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation. Nineteen studies were eligible for inclusion, but only 11 reported data specifically for elderly participants. The efficacy in managing thrombotic risks for each DOAC was similar or superior to VKA in elderly patients. A nonsignificantly higher risk of major bleeding than with VKA was observed with dabigatran 150 mg (odds ratio, 1.18; 95% confidence interval, 0.97–1.44) but not with the 110-mg dose. Significantly higher gastrointestinal bleeding risks with dabigatran 150 mg (1.78, 1.35–2.35) and dabigatran 110 mg (1.40, 1.04–1.90) and lower intracranial bleeding risks than VKA for dabigatran 150 mg (0.43, 0.26–0.72) and dabigatran 110 mg (0.36, 0.22–0.61) were also observed. A significantly lower major bleeding risk in comparison with VKA was observed for apixaban (0.63, 0.51–0.77), edoxaban 60 mg (0.81, 0.67–0.98), and 30 mg (0.46, 0.38–0.57), whereas rivaroxaban showed similar risks.

Conclusions

DOACs demonstrated at least equal efficacy to VKA in managing thrombotic risks in the elderly, but bleeding patterns were distinct. In particular, dabigatran was associated with a higher risk of gastrointestinal bleeding than VKA. Insufficient published data for apixaban, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban indicate that further work is needed to clarify the bleeding risks of these DOACs in the elderly.

### Attitudes of physicians regarding anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation: a systematic review [^1115hChp]. Age and Ageing (2011). Low credibility.

Background

the efficacy of warfarin for prevention of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) is well established, but many people with AF who would benefit from warfarin are not receiving it. This systematic review aims to determine physicians' attitudes to the prescription of warfarin for AF, and identify reasons for its underuse.

Methods

an electronic search of MEDLINE (1950-present), EMBASE (1980-present), CINAHL (1994-present), PsycINFO (1987-present) and Web of Knowledge (1970-present) was performed in November 2010 to identify all studies which addressed, via survey, physicians' attitudes regarding anticoagulation for patients with AF.

Results

a total of 1,375 citations were identified. Of these citations, 44 full text studies were obtained for scrutinisation; 14 of these studies were rejected leaving 30 studies which were included in the review. All included studies were cross-sectional surveys and addressed physicians' opinions of anticoagulation in AF as a primary or secondary aim. Increasing age, increased bleeding risk, previous bleeds, falls risk, co-morbidities and ability to comply with treatment influenced whether physicians would prescribe anticoagulation for AF.

Conclusion

physicians are reticent to recommend warfarin for elderly patients in AF, despite evidence of increased benefit in these patients compared with younger patients. Risk of falls and previous bleeding were also shown to be disproportionate barriers to warfarin prescription. Further studies are required to determine how best to overcome these perceived barriers to appropriate anticoagulation.

### Patients with atrial fibrillation who are not on anticoagulant treatment due to increased bleeding risk are common and Have a high risk of stroke [^113BQUW8]. JACC: Clinical Electrophysiology (2017). Low credibility.

Objectives

This study sought to determine how many patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) are not treated with oral anticoagulants (OAC) due to a high risk of bleeding and to characterize their risk of ischemic stroke in a real-world setting.

Background

AF is associated with a 5-fold increased risk of ischemic stroke. OAC reduce the risk of stroke in patients with AF who do not have an increased bleeding risk, but no comparably effective treatment exists for patients with contraindications to OAC.

Methods

We analyzed administrative claims data from individuals with commercial and Medicare supplemental health insurance in the United States. We selected patients with AF and a documented contraindication to OAC who were not treated with OAC. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of ischemic stroke, as calculated per patient year.

Results

We identified 1,300,643 patients with AF claims, of which 43,248 had a contraindication event and remained OAC naive for at least 1 year or died in hospital. More than 80% of the patients had a CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score of > 1. The incidence of ischemic stroke was 4.1% in the overall OAC naive cohort and was more common with increasing CHA 2 DS 2 /CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score. Hemorrhagic stroke occurred in 3.6%. For patients with previous intracranial bleeding, the incidences of ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke were 12.2% and 20.3%, respectively.

Conclusions

Patients with AF who are not treated with OAC due to increased bleeding risk are common. These patients are at considerable risk of both ischemic and hemorrhagic events. A novel approach to stroke prophylaxis in this population is needed.

### A three-year prospective study of the presentation and clinical outcomes of major bleeding episodes associated with oral anticoagulant use in the UK (ORANGE study) [^113dBWo8]. Haematologica (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Oral anticoagulants (OAC) are highly effective for stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation, for the treatment and prevention of venous thromboembolism, and for the prevention of thrombosis related to mechanical heart valves. It is estimated that OAC therapy is required for 1.25 million people per year in the UK with approximately 70% being for those with atrial fibrillation. This requirement is likely to continue to rise in an aging population, given that the prevalence of atrial fibrillationand the incidence of venous thromboembolismboth increase with age.

The foremost complication of OAC therapy is the development of major bleeding. In the phase III randomized clinical trials which compared warfarin and direct OAC – namely dabigatran etexilate, rivaroxaban, apixaban and edoxaban (DOAC hereafter) – in patients with atrial fibrillation and venous thromboembolism, this risk was reported to be 1–3% per year. In clinical practice some studies have reported similar risks of major bleeding, – while others have found that it may be considerably higher.

When DOAC were first introduced into clinical practice there was concern among clinicians that the lack of specific antidotes could be detrimental to patients' outcomes in the event of major bleeding. Recently, 'post-approval' observational studies have reported on the safety profile of DOAC; however, these studies have primarily focused on patients with atrial fibrillation, using patients' clinical data obtained from national registries/databases which were designed for different purposes. Moreover, these studies lacked detail on the acute management of the bleeds. The burden (with respect to in-hospital mortality, morbidity and duration of hospitalization) of major bleeding associated with all OAC, for any clinical indications, remains largely unknown. This dearth of knowledge is true even in the case of warfarin, which has been the mainstay of OAC therapy for more than 60 years. Moreover, the widespread and increasing use of OAC, particularly in the frail elderly, underscores the urgency of comparative studies to assess the burden of major bleeding events associated with warfarin and DOAC. Such information should be incorporated into the clinical assessment and counseling of patients prescribed OAC, as well as the optimization of strategies for the management of OAC-associated major bleeding events.

### Assessing the risk of bleeding in patients with atrial fibrillation: the loire valley atrial fibrillation project [^1119S6fd]. Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Management decisions for thromboprophylaxis in atrial fibrillation need to balance the risk of stroke against serious hemorrhage. The objective of the present analysis is to compare the Hypertension, Abnormal renal/liver function, Stroke, Bleeding history or predisposition, Labile international normalized ratio, Elderly (> 65 years), Drugs/alcohol concomitantly (HAS-BLED) score against other older bleeding risk scores and the new Anticoagulation and Risk Factors in Atrial Fibrillation score in an atrial fibrillation cohort.

Methods and Results

Patients diagnosed with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation in a 4-hospital institution between 2000 and 2010 were identified. Independent risk factors of bleeding were investigated using Cox regression. The predictive value of several bleeding risk schema was assessed using the c-statistic and net reclassification improvement. Oral anticoagulation use was highest in moderate-risk patients (59.8%) but only slightly more than high-risk (50.1%) and low-risk (46.4%) patients. Those at higher bleeding risk (HAS-BLED ≥ 3) were also at highest risk of stroke/thromboembolism or stroke/thromboembolism/death, as well as bleeding and all-cause mortality. On multivariable analysis, independent predictors of bleeding were age ≥ 75 years and age ≥ 65 years, alcohol excess, anemia, and heart failure. All risk scores had only modest predictive ability for bleeding, whether on vitamin K antagonist or not (c-statistic ≈0.6). When the HAS-BLED score was compared with other bleeding risk scores, the net reclassification improvement was significantly improved against all other scores tested.

Conclusions

Current oral anticoagulation prescribing patterns would suggest that bleeding risk estimation by clinicians is poor and that oral anticoagulation prescribing does not reflect bleeding risk per se. The HAS-BLED score performs well in relation to predicting bleeding events compared with older bleeding scores and the Anticoagulation and Risk Factors in Atrial Fibrillation score, with significantly improved reclassification using HAS-BLED compared with all other bleeding risk scores tested.

### Challenging clinical scenarios for therapeutic anticoagulation: a practical approach [^112XLyK6]. Thrombosis Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Therapeutic anticoagulation remains a fundamental backbone in the treatment and prevention of venous thromboembolism. However, while modern therapies are increasingly safe, anticoagulation is not without risks, particularly in those at high risk for or with recent bleeding. When weighing concurrent risks and benefits in each challenging clinical scenario, an individualized assessment of the risk and acuity of bleeding should be balanced by the indication for anticoagulation. Addressing modifiable risk factors and routine re-evaluation of any changes in this balance is critical. This review outlines available data and current guidelines for the management of anticoagulation in high-risk populations, including those with thrombocytopenia, elderly and high-fall risk, inherited bleeding disorders, and in acute coronary syndrome. We also examine management after clinically significant bleeding episodes, including intracranial hemorrhage, gastrointestinal bleeding, hemoptysis, retroperitoneal bleeding, hematuria, and abnormal uterine bleeding. The aim is to provide a comprehensive review of available literature to guide clinicians in providing optimal, safe, and individualized care for patients in these challenging scenarios.

Methods

This study's protocol was registered with PROSPERO (proprietary) (registration number CRD42022329557) and followed throughout the entire study period. This meta‐analysis was conducted and reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analyses guidelines. The data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request. Because this study used public use data sets that involve deidentified data, it was waived from Institutional Review Board approval in our institution and informed consent.

Data Sources and Search Strategies

We searched the PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases for studies published between the date of database inception and February 10, 2023, that met the following inclusion criteria: (1) articles published in English; (2) randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared a DOAC with a VKA; (3) enrolled patients with AF; (4) event‐driven studies that reported thromboembolic or bleeding outcomes; and (5) studies that reported outcomes for patients aged ≥ 75 years. Secondary analyses of RCTs were included. Abstracts, letters, reviews, meta‐analyses, and gray literature were excluded. Search keywords included direct oral anticoagulants, DOACs, novel oral anticoagulants, NOACs, dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban, warfarin, vitamin K antagonist, atrial fibrillation, randomized controlled trial, clinical trial, controlled clinical trial, stroke, systolic embolism, bleeding, major bleeding, intracranial hemorrhage, and their synonyms and related keywords. Search results, including all titles and abstracts, were independently assessed by 2 authors (D.S.‐H.L. and J.‐K.L.) to identify eligible studies. The full texts of selected publications were further inspected to confirm eligibility. All disagreements on the qualification of studies were resolved through discussion and consensus. Details of the search strategy are provided in Table S1.

### Clinical commentary… [^115S1THm]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

The use of warfarin and direct oral anticoagulants such as rivaroxaban, apixaban, and dabigatran to prevent strokes is the first-line treatment for younger patients with atrial fibrillation. However, the use of direct oral anticoagulants in older people is problematic because of a higher risk of morbidity and mortality from gastrointestinal and intracerebral bleeding, which can be exacerbated by falls. A 2007 Cochrane review evaluated high-quality placebo-controlled studies comparing the benefits and risks of anticoagulation in atrial fibrillation. Participants were younger and had less comorbidity than the general population. After two years, patients taking warfarin experienced 17 out of 1, 000 fewer strokes and five out of 1, 000 fewer disabling or fatal strokes. 10, 11 A 2018 cohort study examined the risks and benefits of anticoagulation in people 90 years and older.

Fifteen out of 1, 000 averted strokes with anticoagulation therapy, and the rate of averting a stroke was similar between warfarin and direct oral anticoagulants. In the direct oral anticoagulant arm, four out of 1, 000 had a hemorrhagic stroke vs. 16 out of 1, 000 in the warfarin arm. In each group using anticoagulation therapy, approximately 60 out of 1, 000 participants had major bleeds.
12. 13 One study of patients who fall often found that patients taking anticoagulants had a similar rate of bleeding as patients not taking anticoagulants; however, patients who did bleed had a higher rate of death if they were taking anticoagulants. 14 It is important to know how well an older patient can tolerate warfarin and whether they can take medication consistently because these factors will affect possible harms.

They also considered his age and recent functional decline, which, if complicated by a fall, could result in severe intracranial bleeding. Together they decided that Mr. H would continue to take the beta blocker to control his heart rate, and he would abstain from anticoagulation therapy and consider taking a daily aspirin as an alternative.

### Risks of oral anticoagulant therapy with increasing age… [^115XJExn]. JAMA Network (2005). Excellent credibility.

We studied the influence of age on the occurrence of major thromboembolic and bleeding events among a large cohort of anticoagulated patients of the Leiden Anticoagulation Clinic who were treated because of mechanical heart valve prostheses, atrial fibrillation, or myocardial infarction. We found that the incidence rate of major hemorrhage increased from 1. 5 per 100 patient-years to
4. 2 per 100 patient-years when we compared patients younger than 60 years with patients older than 80 years. Many authors have speculated why elderly patients have a higher risk of bleeding events when receiving oral anticoagulation. Many factors are likely to play a role. One cause is comorbidity, which is very common in elderly patients and has several aspects. First, potential bleeding sites may result from other diseases. An example of this mechanism is leuko-araiosis, a white matter abnormality on computed tomographic scan, which is an evoking factor for intracerebral bleeding.

18 Second, other diseases might worsen bleedings that already exists or delay healing. In patients treated for atrial fibrillation or myocardial infarction, the bleeding risk rose gradually with age, with the highest incidence in patients older than 80 years. In patients with mechanical heart valve prostheses, however, the older patients and the younger patients both had an increased bleeding risk. An explanation for this finding may be the higher target intensity for patients with mechanical heart valve prostheses that contributes to more traumatic bleeding events in young, physically active patients. We conclude that anticoagulant treatment in elderly patients presents a major clinical dilemma. While the risk of thromboembolism and the subsequent need for proper anticoagulant therapy increases sharply with age, the bleeding risk rises as well.

The question is whether an overall benefit remains for elderly patients who are treated with oral anticoagulants. In patients with atrial fibrillation older than 75 years, the estimated annual stroke risk is 6% or higher despite aspirin therapy. 20 This risk can rise gradually as additional risk factors are present. Prior stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation yields a stroke rate of 12%. 21 An important clinical implication of these findings is that it is not feasible to withhold oral anticoagulant therapy from elderly patients. Hence, all attempts must be focused on ways to lower the bleeding risk.
