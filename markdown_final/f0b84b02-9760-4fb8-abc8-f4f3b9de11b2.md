## Question

OSA oxygen goals

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about oxygen goals in obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether the question is about oxygenation targets during therapy or about the role of supplemental oxygen as a treatment. Then, I should verify what high-quality guidelines say about oxygen as a standalone therapy for OSA. Next, I will review when oxygen is appropriate as adjunctive therapy and what targets are used in that context. After that, I should consider special populations like overlap syndrome or perioperative patients. Finally, I will synthesize a clear, clinically actionable answer with monitoring and safety considerations.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame, because I need to ensure we are not conflating two distinct issues: oxygenation targets during effective OSA therapy versus the use of supplemental oxygen as a treatment modality. Wait, let me verify the guideline stance on oxygen as primary therapy for OSA. Multiple high-credibility sources advise against oxygen as a standalone treatment for OSA due to limited benefit and potential harms, so the "goal" is not to normalize oxygen with oxygen therapy alone but to treat the airway obstruction with positive airway pressure (PAP) and then address residual hypoxemia if it persists [^112fPvT6] [^1166bAEx] [^111HT8Xh].

> I will now examine the evidence on oxygen as a primary therapy. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. Oxygen can raise nadir SpO2, but it does not reduce the apnea–hypopnea index and may prolong obstructive events, and in comparative studies it fails to deliver the cardiovascular benefits seen with CPAP, which is why guidelines recommend against oxygen alone for OSA treatment [^115C4hby] [^112uwU7q] [^111HT8Xh]. Let me double-check the VA/DoD recommendation strength. Yes, it is a weak recommendation against standalone oxygen, reflecting low-quality evidence and a balance of potential harms outweighing benefits in typical OSA without other indications [^112fPvT6].

> Next, I should review when oxygen is appropriate as adjunctive therapy. If a patient on optimized PAP still has clinically significant nocturnal hypoxemia, then adding oxygen can be reasonable, but I need to ensure we document resolution of hypoxemia and monitor for hypercapnia, especially in those with underlying lung disease or obesity hypoventilation physiology [^111HT8Xh] [^114EC9eg]. Let me verify titration targets; during PAP titration or when adding oxygen, a pragmatic target is to achieve SpO2 generally in the 88–94% range while avoiding over-oxygenation, starting low and titrating to effect with close follow-up [^117BG59e] [^116vAUwa].

> But wait, what if the patient has overlap syndrome or ventilatory failure physiology? I should confirm that guidance differs there. In overlap syndrome or established ventilatory failure, oxygen alone can worsen hypercapnia, so guidelines recommend combining oxygen with noninvasive ventilatory support rather than using oxygen monotherapy, and to avoid ordering nocturnal oxygen alone in OSA, OHS, or overlap without addressing ventilatory control [^111fwC1j] [^116QmLRZ]. Hold on, I should verify pediatric guidance; the ATS suggests home oxygen only in sleep-disordered breathing with severe nocturnal hypoxemia when PAP is not tolerated or while awaiting definitive therapy, again underscoring that oxygen is a bridge or adjunct, not a primary OSA therapy [^1166vTeT] [^11791hH5].

> I need to check perioperative contexts because oxygenation practices differ in the immediate postoperative period. The ASA advises administering supplemental oxygen as needed to maintain acceptable oxygen saturation in patients with or at risk for OSA, while recognizing that oxygen can mask hypoventilation and prolong apneas. Thus, continuous monitoring and readiness to escalate to PAP or noninvasive ventilation are essential, and oxygen should be weaned once the patient maintains baseline room-air saturation in an unstimulated state [^113qF9EG] [^115Qq2oj]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought "target SpO2 ≥ 95%" might be a universal post-op goal, but I should correct that; the ASA emphasizes maintaining baseline saturation rather than a fixed high target, given the risk of masking ventilatory events, so individualized targets and vigilant observation are key [^113qF9EG].

> Let me consider patient-centered goals, because oxygenation is only one piece of meaningful outcomes. Patients frequently prioritize reducing health risks, improving sleep quality, and alleviating daytime sleepiness; aligning therapy to these goals improves engagement and adherence, which ultimately drives better physiologic control of hypoxemia via effective PAP rather than oxygen monotherapy [^1171N3kj] [^114rnwBS]. I should confirm that shared decision-making around modalities and expectations is recommended; yes, contemporary guidelines emphasize SDM and adherence support to optimize real-world effectiveness of PAP, which in turn addresses the underlying hypoxemia burden [^1156bwxG] [^111oFdhD].

> Next, I should review how we define and monitor "oxygen goals" in practice. Objective confirmation of OSA and assessment of hypoxemia burden come from diagnostic testing and, when needed, titration polysomnography or home sleep apnea testing, with oxygenation tracked via oximetry and, when appropriate, arterial blood gases to assess for hypercapnia risk in susceptible phenotypes [^115uMyx3] [^113cUGRk]. I need to ensure follow-up includes reassessment of residual hypoxemia on therapy and documentation that any added oxygen is achieving the intended saturation targets without adverse effects, consistent with long-term care pathways [^114EC9eg] [^111HT8Xh].

> Putting this together, I should state the clinical answer clearly. There is no standalone "oxygen goal" that substitutes for treating OSA. The primary goal is effective therapy of obstructive events with PAP, oral appliance, or surgery as appropriate, after which residual nocturnal hypoxemia — if present — can be addressed with carefully titrated supplemental oxygen as an adjunct, typically targeting SpO2 around 88–94% while avoiding over-oxygenation and ensuring close monitoring for hypercapnia, especially in overlap or hypoventilation phenotypes [^116ezaSE] [^117BG59e] [^111HT8Xh]. Hold on, I should verify that this aligns with the highest-quality guidance. The VA/DoD and AASM positions support PAP as first-line and caution against oxygen monotherapy, while titration parameters and BTS guidance inform safe oxygen dosing and the need to combine with ventilatory support when indicated [^112fPvT6] [^117BG59e] [^116QmLRZ].

---

Oxygen therapy is not a primary treatment for OSA [^111HT8Xh] and should not be used as a standalone therapy [^112fPvT6] because it does not reduce AHI or improve daytime sleepiness [^112uwU7q] and may prolong apneas [^112uwU7q]. The main goal of oxygen in OSA is to **prevent severe nocturnal hypoxemia** (SpO2 < 88%) when PAP is not tolerated or as adjunct therapy for residual hypoxemia [^111HT8Xh] [^117BG59e]. Oxygen targets are typically SpO2 ≥ 88–90% during sleep, with careful monitoring for hypercapnia, especially in patients with COPD, obesity hypoventilation, or neuromuscular disease [^117BG59e] [^113cUGRk]. Oxygen should be titrated to the lowest effective flow rate and regularly reassessed for ongoing need and safety [^113cUGRk].

---

## Clinical rationale for oxygen therapy in OSA

Oxygen therapy in OSA is **primarily indicated to mitigate severe nocturnal hypoxemia**, which is associated with increased cardiovascular risk, cognitive impairment, and metabolic dysfunction [^115cMfu4]. However, oxygen therapy does not address the underlying pathophysiology of OSA — namely, recurrent upper airway collapse — and therefore does not reduce the frequency of apneas and hypopneas or improve daytime sleepiness [^112uwU7q].

---

## Oxygenation goals and targets

The primary goal of oxygen therapy in OSA is to **maintain adequate oxygen saturation during sleep** to prevent the adverse consequences of severe nocturnal hypoxemia. The following targets are commonly recommended:

- **Target oxygen saturation (SpO2)**: Maintain SpO2 ≥ 88–90% during sleep [^117BG59e].
- **Avoidance of excessive oxygenation**: Avoid maintaining SpO2 > 96% to prevent potential risks associated with hyperoxia, such as oxidative stress and hypercapnia [^116vAUwa].
- **Individualized targets**: Oxygenation targets should be individualized based on patient-specific factors, including comorbidities such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS), or neuromuscular disorders [^113cUGRk].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Several clinical guidelines provide **specific recommendations** regarding oxygen therapy in OSA:

| **Guideline** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) | - Oxygen therapy is not recommended as a primary treatment for OSA [^111HT8Xh] <br/> - If used, it should be adjunctive to positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy, and oxygen should be titrated to resolve hypoxemia [^117BG59e] |
| Department of Veterans Affairs/Department of Defense (VA/DoD) | - Recommends against oxygen therapy as a standalone treatment for OSA [^112fPvT6] <br/> - Oxygen may be considered as adjunctive therapy in patients who cannot tolerate PAP, but evidence is limited [^notfound] |
| British Thoracic Society (BTS) | - Recommends against ordering nocturnal oxygen therapy alone in patients with OSA, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, or overlap syndrome [^116QmLRZ] <br/> - Oxygen should be combined with noninvasive ventilatory support in patients with ventilatory failure [^111fwC1j] |

---

## Risks and limitations of oxygen therapy in OSA

While oxygen therapy can improve nocturnal oxygen saturation, it carries potential risks and limitations:

- **Prolongation of apneas**: Oxygen therapy may prolong the duration of apneic events, potentially worsening OSA severity [^115C4hby].
- **Hypercapnia**: Oxygen therapy can increase the risk of hypercapnia, particularly in patients with underlying respiratory conditions such as COPD or obesity hypoventilation syndrome [^111HT8Xh].
- **Lack of improvement in daytime symptoms**: Oxygen therapy does not significantly improve daytime sleepiness or quality of life in patients with OSA [^112uwU7q].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular monitoring and follow-up are essential for patients receiving oxygen therapy for OSA. This includes:

- **Polysomnography**: Objective assessment of oxygen saturation, apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), and detection of potential complications such as hypercapnia [^114jY6cJ].
- **Arterial blood gas analysis**: Periodic assessment of arterial blood gases to monitor for hypercapnia and ensure adequate oxygenation [^notfound].
- **Patient education**: Educating patients about the risks and benefits of oxygen therapy, adherence to therapy, and recognition of potential complications [^112uwU7q].

---

## Alternative and adjunctive therapies

Given the limitations of oxygen therapy, **alternative and adjunctive therapies** should be considered:

- **Positive airway pressure (PAP)**: CPAP or APAP remains the first-line therapy for OSA, effectively reducing AHI, improving oxygen saturation, and alleviating daytime symptoms [^115Z67pU] [^111oFdhD] [^114t8mFs].
- **Oral appliance therapy**: Recommended for patients who cannot tolerate PAP therapy, providing modest improvements in oxygen saturation and AHI [^113HYGFd].
- **Lifestyle modifications**: Weight loss, positional therapy, and avoidance of alcohol and sedatives are important adjunctive measures [^111Bhxhj].

---

Oxygen therapy in OSA is **adjunctive** to maintain SpO2 ≥ 88–90% during sleep and prevent severe nocturnal hypoxemia; it is not a primary therapy and does not reduce AHI or improve daytime sleepiness. Use the lowest effective flow, monitor for hypercapnia, and reassess regularly. PAP remains first-line; consider oral appliances or lifestyle changes if PAP is not tolerated.

### Research priorities for translating endophenotyping of adult obstructive sleep apnea to the clinic: an official American Thoracic Society research statement [^116Mthz9]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and consequences vary markedly among patients. Yet, OSA heterogeneity goes largely unaddressed in current management pathways, which are characterized by high treatment failure rates of ~50%. Growing knowledge of OSA pathogenesis has stimulated new lines of investigation for therapies targeted to specific underlying mechanisms or "endotypes". OSA endotypes include the primary anatomical predisposition to pharyngeal collapse, as well as "non-anatomic" mechanisms of low arousal threshold, unstable control of breathing (high loop gain), and impaired pharyngeal dilator muscle function. Identification of inter-individual differences in OSA endotypes and disease expression, or "OSA phenotypes", offer promise for a more targeted approach to OSA management in which appropriate treatments are tailored to individual needs. However, these concepts have largely been limited to the research setting and more evidence is needed to support clinical translation.

Goals

To outline the rationale for clinical use, challenges, and key research priorities required to translate OSA endophenotyping for delivery of a more tailored approach to improve patient care and outcomes.

Methods

An international multidisciplinary Working Group with expertise in OSA epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnostics, and treatments was convened. The Group met at the ATS 2024 International Conference to discuss the current state of OSA endophenotyping and required research objectives. This Research Statement, authored with input from all members, summarizes the group discussion, identified Key Areas and Research Priorities.

Results

The Working Group identified research priorities that cover the spectrum from discovery to translation/implementation including technical standards, validation, establishment of clinical cutoffs/minimal clinically important differences, generalizability across diverse populations, stability and reproducibility of measurement, prospective study design/conduct, clinical utility, and impact analysis.

Conclusions

This Research Statement provides a road map of the opportunities and key steps required to generate the evidence necessary to translate OSA endophenotyping concepts into clinical care at scale.

### Clinical guideline for the evaluation, management and long-term care of obstructive sleep apnea in adults [^112TzmFM]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common chronic disorder that often requires lifelong care. Available practice parameters provide evidence-based recommendations for addressing aspects of care.

Objective

This guideline is designed to assist primary care providers as well as sleep medicine specialists, surgeons, and dentists who care for patients with OSA by providing a comprehensive strategy for the evaluation, management and long-term care of adult patients with OSA.

Methods

The Adult OSA Task Force of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) was assembled to produce a clinical guideline from a review of existing practice parameters and available literature. All existing evidence-based AASM practice parameters relevant to the evaluation and management of OSA in adults were incorporated into this guideline. For areas not covered by the practice parameters, the task force performed a literature review and made consensus recommendations using a modified nominal group technique.

Recommendations

Questions regarding OSA should be incorporated into routine health evaluations. Suspicion of OSA should trigger a comprehensive sleep evaluation. The diagnostic strategy includes a sleep-oriented history and physical examination, objective testing, and education of the patient. The presence or absence and severity of OSA must be determined before initiating treatment in order to identify those patients at risk of developing the complications of sleep apnea, guide selection of appropriate treatment, and to provide a baseline to establish the effectiveness of subsequent treatment. Once the diagnosis is established, the patient should be included in deciding an appropriate treatment strategy that may include positive airway pressure devices, oral appliances, behavioral treatments, surgery, and/or adjunctive treatments. OSA should be approached as a chronic disease requiring long-term, multidisciplinary management. For each treatment option, appropriate outcome measures and long-term follow-up are described.

### Patient-defined goals for obstructive sleep apnea treatment [^1171N3kj]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Adult patients with OSA most commonly report treatment goals that can be categorized into reducing OSA-related health risks, improving sleep quality, reducing daytime sleepiness, and improving snoring. Primary treatment goal choices were associated with OSA severity, age, levels of daytime sleepiness, PAP use history, and impact of OSA on global function. Understanding and querying patient-specific goals are essential first steps in the SDM process where the conversation focuses on the ways that different treatments may or may not meet personalized goals. Ultimately, goal-focused discussions ensure alignment of priorities and definitions of success between the patient and the provider.

Objectives

To characterize the treatment goals and values of adult patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).

Study Design

Mixed methods design based on semistructured interviews followed by cross-sectional surveys.

Setting

Academic medical center and integrated managed care consortium.

Methods

Phase 1 involved qualitative analysis of focus groups and interviews to define treatment goal categories. Phase 2 included analysis of cross-sectional surveys on most important treatment goals from patients with OSA presenting to sleep surgery clinic. Positive airway pressure (PAP) use, Epworth Sleepiness Scale score, and apnea-hypopnea index were obtained to determine influences on goal choices.

Results

During focus groups and interviews, treatment goal themes identified included improving sleep quality, reducing daytime sleepiness, snoring sound reduction, and health risk reduction. In phase 2, 536 patients were surveyed, and they reported the primary treatment goals of health risk reduction (35%), sleep quality improvement (28%), daytime sleepiness improvement (21%), and snoring sound reduction (16%). The primary treatment goal was associated with age (P < .0001), excessive daytime sleepiness (Epworth Sleepiness Scale score > 10, P < .0001), PAP use status (P < .0001), and OSA severity (apnea-hypopnea index, P < .0001). Severity of OSA was associated with increasing proportion of patients choosing health risk reduction as the main treatment goal (P < .05).

Conclusions

Adult OSA treatment goal choices vary with age, symptoms, PAP history, and OSA severity. Understanding patient-specific goals is the essential first step in the shared decision-making process when choosing surgical or nonsurgical treatments. Ultimately, goal-focused discussions ensure alignment of priorities and definitions of success between the patient and the provider.

Recommendation 3.2.6: Patients Should Be Encouraged to Wear Their PAP Device at Appropriate Times During Their Stay in the Hospital, Both Preoperatively and Postoperatively (Level of Evidence: Moderate. Grade of Recommendation: Strong for):

As noted earlier, accumulating evidence suggests that PAP therapy for OSA patients may play a role in reducing postoperative complications.– We recommend patients be encouraged to use their PAP therapy at their previously prescribed setting during sleep while in the hospital. Simple maneuvers such as refitting a mask, the addition of heated humidification, or the control of nasal congestion with nasal corticosteroid sprays may help patients to adhere to therapy, and consideration should be given to inquiring about these issues in poorly adherent patients. Consultation with the patient's sleep specialist may be considered if there are additional questions regarding optimizing PAP usage in the postoperative care setting.

3.3. Question: What Are the Best Preoperative Practices Aimed at Improving Outcomes for Surgical Patients Who Have a High Probability for OSA?

Recommendation 3.3.1: The Patient, Surgeon, Anesthesiologist, and the Health Care Team Should Be Aware Before the Procedure That the Patient Has a High Probability of Having OSA, Which May Increase the Morbidity Associated With Surgery (Level of Evidence: Low. Grade of Recommendation: Strong for)

The consensus of the SASM Task Force is that all perioperative providers, as well as the patient, should be aware that the patient has a high probability of having OSA, and this could potentially adversely affect their clinical course. – Identifying these patients preoperatively will allow for the implementation of specific practices and protocols aimed at minimizing perioperative risk.–

Recommendation 3.3.2: We Suggest That Additional Evaluation for Preoperative Cardiopulmonary Optimization Be Considered in Patients Who Have a High Probability of Having OSA and Where There Is Indication of Uncontrolled Systemic Conditions or Additional Problems With Ventilation or Gas Exchange. These Conditions Include, but May Not Be Limited to (i) Hypoventilation Syndromes, (ii) Severe Pulmonary Hypertension, and (iii) Resting Hypoxemia Not Attributable to Other Cardiopulmonary Disease (Level of Evidence: Low. Grade of Recommendation: Weak for)

The Task Force recognizes that there is a paucity of data to support delaying surgery for patients with a high probability of having OSA. However, as noted in 3.2.3, patients with certain comorbidities, such as clinically significant hypoventilationor pulmonary hypertension, may be more likely to develop postoperative complications, and these conditions commonly coexist with OSA. Unexplained preoperative hypoxemia should also warrant consideration for further preoperative evaluation.

### Treatment of adult obstructive sleep apnea with positive airway pressure: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline [^111oFdhD]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnea — Recommendation 4 (PAP initiation) states: "We recommend positive airway pressure therapy be initiated using either APAP at home or in-laboratory PAP titration in adults with OSA and no significant comorbidities. (STRONG)". Remarks specify that "When APAP is initiated in the home setting, therapy is maintained over the long-term by either using a fixed, continuous pressure setting determined from PAP monitoring data or continuing in the auto-adjusting mode", and "In-laboratory titration refers to both full-night and split-night titration", with the choice "based on access, cost-effectiveness, patient preference, sleep clinician judgement, and other factors". This recommendation "is based on studies that excluded patients with the following comorbidities: congestive heart failure, chronic opiate use, significant lung disease such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, neuromuscular disease, history of uvulopalatopharyngoplasty, sleep-related oxygen requirements, or expectation for nocturnal arterial oxyhemoglobin desaturation due to conditions other than OSA, including hypoventilation syndromes and central sleep apnea syndromes", and it reflects trials in which "mask fittings and education on PAP use at a sleep center and/or close follow-up by trained staff… were provided to the home APAP group", with "daytime acclimatization to PAP" included in some studies.

### Multi-center, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of nocturnal oxygen therapy in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a study protocol for the INOX trial [^114Ym93c]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Exclusion of sleep apnea

COPD and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) are common conditions. The combination of COPD and sleep apnea is referred to as the "overlap syndrome". A population-based study indicated that both conditions are not linked by common pathophysiological mechanisms, and that their association is only by chance. The routine utilization of sleep studies in patients with COPD to distinguish between sleep apnea and nocturnal oxygen desaturation alone (i.e. without sleep apnea) is controversial. On one hand, the access to diagnostic facilities for patients with suspected sleep apnea in Canada and many other jurisdictions is unfortunately very limited, and the requirement of a polysomnography for all patients in the frame of this study would be unrealistic. On the other hand, 42% of the Canadian pulmonologists think that all COPD patients with significant nocturnal desaturation should have a polysomnography to rule out sleep apnea. In a blind comparison of home nocturnal oximetry and laboratory polysomnography in consecutive patients with COPD and nocturnal oxygen desaturation, we found that, in patients with significant nocturnal oxygen desaturation, home nocturnal oximetry has high negative predictive value for the diagnosis of OSA (unpublished data). However, home nocturnal oximetry has a poor positive predictive value for the diagnosis of OSA. It is on the basis of this study that we constructed the algorithm for the patients' screening and selection (Fig. 2).

### Society of anesthesia and sleep medicine guidelines on preoperative screening and assessment of adult patients with obstructive sleep apnea [^112nKjFD]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2016). Low credibility.

Recommendations 3.2.1 to 3.2.3 Are Identical to Recommendations 3.1.1 to 3.1.3Recommendation 3.2.4: We Suggest That Additional Evaluation for Preoperative Cardiopulmonary Optimization Be Considered in Patients Who Have a Known Diagnosis of OSA and Are Nonadherent or Poorly Adherent to PAP Therapy and Where There Is Indication of Uncontrolled Systemic Conditions or Additional Problems With Ventilation or Gas Exchange. These Conditions Include, But May Not Be Limited to (i) Hypoventilation Syndromes, (ii) Severe Pulmonary Hypertension, and (iii) Resting Hypoxemia Not Attributable to Other Cardiopulmonary Disease (Level of Evidence: Low. Grade of Recommendation: Weak for):

The Task Force recognizes that there is a paucity of data to support delaying surgery for patients with untreated OSA. However, patients with certain comorbidities, such as clinically significant hypoventilationor pulmonary hypertension, may be more likely to develop postoperative complications, and these conditions commonly coexist with OSA. Resting hypoxemia in the absence of other known cardiopulmonary disease should also warrant consideration for further preoperative evaluation. A combination of OSA and acute or chronic cardiopulmonary diseases needs to be considered in such a scenario. When untreated OSA is present, benefit may exist to initiating and optimizing PAP therapy to appropriately treat OSA while simultaneously enhancing postoperative respiratory function.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the management of chronic insomnia disorder and obstructive sleep apnea [^112uwU7q]. DoD/VA (2025). High credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and oxygen therapy — The Work Group categorized this topic as Weak Against, Not reviewed, Amended and decided on a Weak against recommendation, noting that The Work Group's confidence in the quality of the evidence was low and The potential harms of oxygen therapy as treatment for OSA slightly outweighed the benefits. Although oxygen can improve oxygen saturation in patients with OSA, it may also increase the duration of apnea-hypopnea events. Evidence summarized includes that in the largest study comparing oxygen therapy with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), CPAP but not nocturnal oxygen resulted in a significant reduction in blood pressure, while smaller studies demonstrated benefit in nocturnal hypoxemia with oxygen therapy in patients with OSA but no reduction in AHI or improvement in daytime functioning. The Work Group also considered patient values and preferences, and resource use, and highlighted safety and feasibility issues, including that the use of home oxygen carries the small risk of adverse events, including combustion/explosion and fire, and there is some evidence it may prolong respiratory events during sleep, and that it may be difficult to obtain this treatment without evidence of nocturnal hypoxemia. Importantly, oxygen therapy may be used in the treatment of other respiratory conditions, and this recommendation should not be interpreted as recommending against oxygen therapy in those situations or if oxygen is added to positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy to alleviate residual hypoxia with PAP use.

### Supplemental oxygen needs during sleep. who benefits? [^113cUGRk]. Respiratory Care (2013). Low credibility.

The physiologic changes that occur in ventilation during sleep contribute to nocturnal oxygen desaturation in those with lung disease. Nocturnal supplemental oxygen is often used as therapy, although convincing data exist only for those who are hypoxemic both during sleep and wake. Ongoing trials may help address whether oxygen should be used in those with only desaturation during sleep. If used, oxygen should be dosed as needed, and patients should be monitored for hypercapnia. Because of its prevalence, obstructive sleep apnea may commonly overlap with lung disease in many patients and have important consequences. Patients with overlap syndromes may be good candidates for noninvasive ventilation during sleep.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) has been associated with increased perioperative morbidity and mortality. We initiated a protocol designed to screen patients preoperatively and monitor them postoperatively. The goal was to identify patients who were at risk for oxygen desaturation after discharge from the postanesthesia recovery room (PACU).

Methods

Patients without previously diagnosed OSA presenting to the preoperative evaluation clinic were assessed over a 10.5-month period using a validated prediction rule to identify patients thought to be at high risk of OSA (sleep apnea clinical score, SACS ≥ 15). Following surgery, patients were monitored in the PACU for significant respiratory events: apnea, increased FiO2 requirement, pain-sedation mismatch, or episodes of desaturation. Patients were placed in 3 groups based on their SACS and the presence or absence of recurrent PACU respiratory events (group 1: SACS < 15, no recurrent events; group 2: SACS ≥ 15, no recurrent events; and group 3: SACS ≥ 15, recurrent events.) The number of oxygen desaturations ≥ 4% per hour, the oxygen desaturation index (ODI), was calculated for each patient for 24 to 48 hours after PACU discharge. An ODI > 10 was the threshold chosen to indicate a high frequency of oxygen desaturation.

Results

The percentage of patients with ODI > 10 differed significantly across the 3 study groups (12%, 37%, and 57%, for groups 1–3, p = 0.005). Mean ODI in group 1 was significantly different from groups 2 and 3 (5.8 compared to 10.0 group 2 and 11.4 group 3 with p = 0.001).

Conclusions

We have shown that combining preoperative screening is useful for identifying patients at risk for oxygen desaturation after PACU discharge.

Predictors of adherence to continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) in adult OSA: Five studies (1 high-, 1 moderate-, and 3 low-quality) assessed adherence in patients with mean baseline apnea–hypopnea index (AHI) scores between 24 and 50 events per hour; several found that higher baseline AHI and Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) scores predicted greater adherence, including ESS greater than 10, while younger age showed mixed associations, and greater baseline mean oxygen saturation and greater sleepiness were associated with adherence in one study.

### Treatment recommendations for obstructive sleep apnea… [^111sULBA]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

Up to 4 percent of adult Americans are affected with obstructive sleep apnea. OSA includes snoring, upper airway resistance syndrome and obesity-hypoventilation syndrome. It may lead to daytime somnolence, impaired cognition, hypertension, cardiac arrhythmia or infarction. The gold standard for diagnosis of OSA is all-night polysomnography. Home testing devices are also available but should be used only if all-night polysomnography is unavailable or as a means of following a patient with known OSA. The rightsholder did not grant rights to reproduce this item in electronic media. For the missing item, see the original print version of this publication.

The respiratory disturbance index, symptom severity and comorbidities are the factors used to guide treatment decisions. General recommendations include avoidance of central nervous system depressants and education about sleep hygiene, weight loss, treatment of nasal congestion and sleeping in a lateral position. Continuous positive airway pressure is the treatment of choice for patients with OSA. A titration study is needed to determine the optimal CPAP pressure, with the goal being to abolish all sleep-related symptoms. Some researchers recommend treating patients with a respiratory disturbance index of greater than 30, although others are inclined to treat a patient whose respiratory disturbance index is greater than 20.

Although CPAP is known to improve sleep quality, oxygen saturation, hypertension, cognitive function and mood, and to decrease mortality, only about 46 percent of patients are compliant with CPAP for at least four hours per night. Using oral appliances and moving the mandible and tongue are sometimes suggested, but these treatments may be associated with excessive salivation or pain. Surgical procedures also attempt to correct upper airway anatomy. Higher body mass index, greater severity of OSA and more anatomic abnormalities may be indications to pursue surgical treatment. However, these treatments, such as laser-assisted uvulopalatoplasty, midline glossectomy and lingualplasty, have not shown long-term success, and patients may experience severe pain after the procedures. An algorithm for the management of patients with sleep-related breathing disorders is presented in the accompanying figure.

### High priority future research needs for obstructive sleep apnea diagnosis and treatment [^116627KJ]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Study Objectives

To identify and prioritize future research needs (FRN) topics for diagnosis and treatment of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).

Methods

Twenty-one panel members represented six stake-holder categories: patients and the public, providers; purchasers of health care, payers, policymakers, and principal investigators. Building on a recently completed comparative effectiveness review, stakeholders nominated and discussed potential FRN topics. Stakeholders then nominated their top priority FRN topics based on the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Effective Health Care Program Selection Criteria. From these nominations, the highest priority FRN topics were determined and were elaborated upon to include possible study designs to address the topics.

Results

Thirty-seven topics were discussed and prioritized. The nine highest priority FRN topics included: cost-effectiveness of management strategies, defining age- and sex-specific criteria for OSA, evaluating routine preoperative screening for OSA, evaluating involvement of a sleep medicine specialist in diagnosis of OSA, evaluating clinical prediction rules, assessing the effect of treating sleep disordered breathing and long-term clinical outcomes, comparing treatments for patients who do not tolerate positive airway pressure, evaluating strategies to improve treatment compliance, and evaluating the association between sleep apnea severity and long-term clinical outcomes.

Conclusions

While there are numerous specific research questions with low or insufficient strength of evidence for OSA management, OSA patients, their healthcare providers, and society at large would benefit from refocusing research efforts into the prioritized research questions and away from simple comparisons of short-term outcomes between specific interventions.

### Don't maintain a peripheral capillary oxygen saturation of… [^116vAUwa]. AAFP (2023). Medium credibility.

Ideal oxygen saturation levels for patients getting supplemental oxygen therapy is at or below 96%. The overuse of supplemental oxygen has been shown to increase mortality in numerous studies of patients with a variety of critical illnesses, including cardiac arrest, stroke, and trauma, as well as after emergency surgery. Higher oxygen levels may be needed for those with certain medical conditions such as carbon monoxide poisoning or special types of headaches such as cluster headaches, sickle cell crisis, or pneumothorax. An important caveat to this recommendation is the higher incidence of occult hypoxemia, defined as an arterial oxygen saturation of less than 88% with a pulse oximetry measurement of 92% to 96%, in Black patients compared with White patients.

### Practice guidelines for the perioperative management of patients with obstructive sleep apnea: an updated report by the American society of anesthesiologists task force on perioperative management of patients with obstructive sleep apnea [^1113G7ML]. Anesthesiology (2014). Medium credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) — pathophysiology, perioperative risk, and prevalence — is described as periodic, partial, or complete obstruction of the upper airway during sleep causing repetitive arousal and daytime consequences, including daytime hypersomnolence, aggressive or distractible behavior in children, episodic sleep-associated oxygen desaturation, episodic hypercarbia, and cardiovascular dysfunction. The adult prevalence of sleep disordered breathing as measured in a sleep laboratory is 9% in women and 24% in men, whereas overt OSA is 2% in women and 4% in men, and these figures are likely to increase as the population becomes older and more obese. In the perioperative period, both pediatric and adult patients with OSA, even if asymptomatic, present special challenges that must be systematically addressed to minimize the risk of perioperative morbidity or mortality, and it is the opinion of the Task Force that the perioperative risk to patients increases in proportion to the severity of sleep apnea.

### Clinical guideline for the evaluation, management and long-term care of obstructive sleep apnea in adults [^114LGqzZ]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2009). Medium credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in adults — preoperative evaluation and selection specify that the diagnosis of OSA should be established prior to surgery and the severity determined by objective testing (Consensus). This evaluation should include an anatomical examination with assessment of medical, psychological or social comorbidities and the patient's desire for surgery, and the patient should be counseled on surgical options, likelihood of success, goals of treatment, risks and benefits, possible side effects, complications, and alternative treatments (Consensus). Evaluation for primary surgical treatment can be considered in patients with mild OSA who have severe obstructing anatomy that is surgically correctable (Consensus). Surgical procedures can be considered as a secondary treatment when PAP is intolerant or unable to eliminate OSA, and may also be considered when OA outcomes are inadequate or the patient is intolerant (Consensus). Surgery may also be considered as an adjunct therapy when obstructive anatomy or functional deficiencies compromise other therapies or to improve tolerance of other OSA treatments (Consensus).

### ACP releases guideline on the management of OSA… [^116uVZiG]. AAFP (2014). Low credibility.

Key Points for Practice Physicians should encourage all persons with OSA who are overweight or obese to lose weight. CPAP is the recommended initial treatment for OSA. Use of a mandibular advancement device is an alternative treatment for those who prefer it or if CPAP leads to adverse effects From the AFP Editors. Obstructive sleep apnea affects persons of all ages, and rates are likely increasing because of higher rates of obesity, which is a risk factor for OSA. Management is based on type and severity of symptoms and on patient education about the benefits vs. adverse effects associated with the treatment options. The American College of Physicians has developed a guideline to assist physicians in choosing the best initial treatment for adults with OSA. Recommendations Continuous positive airway pressure is the recommended initial treatment for OSA in addition to weight loss.

It improves Epworth Sleepiness Scale scores, reduces apnea-hypopnea index and arousal index scores, and increases oxygen saturation. Studies show that CPAP is more effective than control treatments or sham CPAP, although there were no data on long-term outcomes, such as death or cardiovascular illness, and inconsistent data regarding the effects on quality of life. Evidence shows that fixed CPAP, auto-CPAP, and C-Flex are similar in adherence and effectiveness, although data were insufficient to compare other CPAP modifications. Evidence was limited about which patients would benefit from either CPAP or a mandibular advancement device. Patients with more severe OSA may more readily adhere to CPAP treatment. Other factors that may increase the likelihood of adherence to CPAP are younger age, snoring, lower CPAP setting, higher body mass index, greater mean oxygen saturation, and the sleepiness domain on the Grenoble Sleep Apnea Quality of Life test.

Evidence was insufficient to compare the effectiveness of other treatments, such as positional therapy, oropharyngeal exercise, palatal implants, surgery, pharmacologic therapy, and atrial overdrive pacing. Physicians should encourage all persons with OSA who are overweight or obese to lose weight. Intensive weight loss in these patients has been shown to reduce apnea-hypopnea index scores and improve OSA symptoms.

### Patient-centered care in obstructive sleep apnea: a vision for the future [^117BoyE5]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnea is a common condition, with multiple potential neurocognitive, cardiovascular, and metabolic consequences. Efficacious treatment is available, but patient engagement is typically required for treatment to be effective. Patients with sleep apnea are phenotypically diverse and have individual needs, preferences, and values that impact treatment decisions. There has been a shift in obstructive sleep apnea management from diagnosis to chronic care management. Making treatment decisions that incorporate an individual patient's values and preferences and are personalized for that patient's biology has the potential to improve patient outcomes. A patient-centered care approach in obstructive sleep apnea is reviewed including 1) determining patient-specific needs to guide treatment decisions, 2) understanding patient values, preferences, and other factors impacting treatment decisions and using shared decision-making, 3) enhancing patient education and support to improve treatment adherence, 4) promoting patient engagement, 5) optimizing care coordination, continuity of care, and access to care, and 6) determining and assessing patient-centered outcomes.

### Moving toward equitable care for sleep apnea in the United States: positive airway pressure adherence thresholds: an official American Thoracic Society policy statement [^117MH2Cx]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Our goal is to eliminate OSA therapy use disparities, starting with policy changes in coverage determination and a reframing of PAP adherence. A strict, inflexible number defining adherence is counter to PAP efficacy research and exacerbates health inequities. Goals and expectations for PAP therapy need to be calibrated to individual circumstances and patient-centered outcomes, and periodic reevaluation of these goals realigns PAP therapy with the updated patient situation.

The committee is in full agreement that consistent PAP use during sleep is a critical component of PAP efficacy, particularly in marginalized populations. However, adherence is not an immutable characteristic. Additional efforts to improve adherence would focus resources both before therapy and at the start of therapy. Education, goal setting, and evaluation and mitigation of factors that hinder PAP use are critical objectives before the initiation of therapy. Close and early follow-up, combined with intervention, if needed, are key to improving PAP adherence. However, these initiatives are not enough. Policy change is needed to promote health equity. Experimentation with different models of care provision and community outreach can improve PAP uptake in marginalized communities. Measurement is necessary for continued focus on productive change. Assessing PAP disparities can inform change. Therefore, monitoring DME provider equity in care provision would make equity initiatives a priority. A change to CMS guidelines on therapy reinitialization to avoid unnecessary procedures and address the core causes of previous nonadherence could also improve PAP adherence and decrease care disparities while simultaneously reducing costs.

### Clinical practice guideline for diagnostic testing for adult obstructive sleep apnea: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline [^115uMyx3]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Adult obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) background and diagnostic definitions — Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) includes OSA, central sleep apnea (CSA), and sleep-related hypoventilation, and the diagnosis of OSA involves measuring breathing during sleep. In population-based data using an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) cutoff, the prevalence of OSA has been estimated to be 14% in men and 5% of women with AHI ≥ 5 events/h and hypopneas associated with ≥ 4% oxygen desaturation, while rates are higher in selected groups such as patients evaluated for bariatric surgery (estimated 70% to 80%) and those with transient ischemic attack or stroke (estimated 60% to 70%). Patients with untreated OSA may be at increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease, and treatment has been shown to improve quality of life, lower the rates of motor vehicle accidents, and reduce chronic health risks. Per ICSD-3, OSA is defined as a PSG-determined obstructive respiratory disturbance index (RDI) ≥ 5 events/h with typical symptoms, or an obstructive RDI ≥ 15 events/h even without symptoms; the RDI includes respiratory effort-related arousals (RERAs), and event scoring is defined in the AASM Manual for the Scoring of Sleep and Associated Events.

### Society of anesthesia and sleep medicine guideline on intraoperative management of adult patients with obstructive sleep apnea [^111u1pE9]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2018). Low credibility.

OSA is a common and frequently undiagnosed disorder defined by the repeated collapse of the upper airway with resultant blood oxygen desaturation events during sleep. OSA has been associated with adverse long-term health outcomes and has been linked to increased perioperative complication risk. – Indeed, a comprehensive review of the literature performed by a task force appointed by SASM revealed substantial risk for adverse events, especially pulmonary complications, to be associated with OSA in the perioperative period. Based on the elevated risk for perioperative complications, the recently published SASM Guideline on Preoperative Screening and Assessment of Adults With Obstructive Sleep Apnea recommends that attempts should be made to appropriately identify patients with OSA, with the goal to raise awareness among providers, mitigate risk, and improve outcomes. While recommendations for preoperative screening and assessment of patients with OSA and their optimal preparation for surgery are now available, there is a paucity of evidence-based guidance for the intraoperative management of this patient population. Thus, there remains a lack of evidence-based practice recommendations regarding techniques for airway management, selection of anesthetic agents, and drugs, as well as choice of anesthetic technique.

This document is derived from results of an extensive consensus process based on a systematic literature search, review, and analysis performed by experts in the field. It is a follow-up to the previously published SASM Guideline on Preoperative Screening and Assessment of Adult Patients With Obstructive Sleep Apnea. Given the large amount of related literature in this arena, this study focuses only on intraoperative patient care. Postoperative care issues are not considered and may be the subject of future projects.

It requires that the clinician uses clinical knowledge and experience and strongly considers the individual patient's values and preferences to determine the best course of action, and the ultimate judgment regarding any specific care must be made by the treating clinician and the patient, taking into consideration the individual circumstances of the patient, available treatment options, and preferences. The following clinical practice recommendations are based on a systematic review and evaluation of evidence using the GRADE process.

### Evaluation and management of obstructive sleep apnea in adults hospitalized for medical care: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline [^115CMkHn]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The purpose of this guideline is to establish clinical practice recommendations for the management of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in medically hospitalized adults.

Methods

The American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) commissioned a task force of experts in sleep medicine to develop recommendations and assign strengths based on a systematic review of the literature and an assessment of the evidence using Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation methodology. The task force provided a summary of the relevant literature and the certainty of evidence, the balance of benefits and harms, patient values and preferences, and resource use considerations that support the recommendations. The AASM Board of Directors approved the final recommendations.

Good Practice Statement

The following good practice statement is based on expert consensus, and its implementation is necessary for the appropriate and effective management of hospitalized adults with sleep-disordered breathing: For medically hospitalized adults with an established diagnosis of sleep-disordered breathing and on active treatment, existing treatment should be continued rather than withheld, unless contraindicated.

Recommendations

The following recommendations are intended as a guide for clinicians in managing medically hospitalized adults with OSA. Each recommendations statement is assigned a strength ("Strong" or "Conditional"). A "Strong" recommendation (i.e., "We recommend… ") is one that clinicians should follow under most circumstances. A "conditional" recommendation (i.e., "We suggest… ") is one that requires that the clinician use clinical knowledge and experience and strongly consider the patient's values and preferences to determine the best course of action.

1. For medically hospitalized adults at increased risk for OSA, the AASM suggests in-hospital screening for OSA as part of an evaluation and management pathway that incorporates diagnosis and treatment with positive airway pressure rather than no in-hospital screening. (Conditional recommendation, low certainty of evidence).

Remarks: Screening may include validated questionnaires and/or screening with overnight high-resolution pulse oximetry (HRPO). When considering in-hospital screening as part of a management pathway, 1) patients who place a lower value on the potential reduction of clinically meaningful outcomes (e.g., cardiovascular events) and place a higher value on the possible downsides associated with the use of positive airway pressure (PAP) (e.g., sleep disruption, discomfort), or 2) clinicians who perceive that the diagnosis or management of OSA may interfere with medical care, would reasonably decline OSA screening or PAP during the hospitalization. High risk for OSA is defined by signs and symptoms that suggest moderate to severe OSA (e.g., excessive daytime somnolence + 2 of the following: diagnosed hypertension; habitual loud snoring; witnessed apnea, gasping, or choking and/or association of high-risk comorbidities as outlined in the Figure 1 caption). Diagnostic testing for OSA should ideally be conducted after a patient has been medically stabilized during the hospital stay or post-discharge.

2. For medically hospitalized adults with an established diagnosis of moderate-to-severe OSA and not currently on treatment, the AASM suggests the use of inpatient treatment with positive airway pressure rather than no positive airway pressure. (Conditional recommendation, low certainty of evidence).

Remarks: When considering in-hospital OSA treatment, 1) patients who place a lower value on the potential reduction of clinically meaningful outcomes (e.g., cardiovascular events) and place a higher value on the possible downsides associated with the use of PAP (e.g., sleep disruption, discomfort), or 2) clinicians who perceive that the diagnosis or management of OSA may interfere with medical care, would reasonably decline OSA screening or PAP during the hospitalization.

3. For medically hospitalized adults at increased risk for or with an established diagnosis of OSA, the AASM suggests that sleep medicine consultation be available as part of an evaluation and management pathway, rather than no sleep medicine consultation. (Conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence).

Remarks: It is recognized that there will be variability of the availability of hospital-based expertise and resources specific to sleep medicine consultation; therefore, we provide specific guidance as follows. Oversight by a board-certified sleep medicine clinician and/or an AASM-accredited sleep center is preferable. However, elements of this consultation including education and follow-up plan can be provided by those with requisite expertise including advanced practitioners, nurses, sleep technologists, respiratory therapists, care coordinators, case managers, health educators, or other available resource personnel. Given the variability of expertise and resources available, creative consultation models of care such as teleconsult/telehealth, E-consult and/or nursing or respiratory therapist care can be considered. Availability of inpatient diagnostics and treatment as part of the consultation should be taken into consideration in terms of feasibility of implementation of this recommendation.

4. For medically hospitalized adults at increased risk for or with an established diagnosis of OSA, the AASM suggests a discharge management plan to ensure timely diagnosis and effective management of OSA, rather than no plan. (Conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence).

Remarks: Consider ordering post-discharge testing or sleep medicine evaluation prior to discharge. Inpatient sleep testing prior to discharge and/or telehealth medicine may be an option to reduce barriers to care. Consider care coordination to ensure appropriate follow-up and post-discharge care.

If used with other primary therapies to treat hypoxemia, "follow-up must include documentation of resolution of the hypoxemia (Consensus)", and oxygen alone "may also prolong apneas and may potentially worsen nocturnal hypercapnia in patients with comorbid respiratory disease". For residual excessive daytime sleepiness despite effective positive airway pressure (PAP), "Modafinil is recommended" when no other cause is identifiable, and "Modafinil should be used in addition to PAP therapy" after other causes "must be ruled out including: suboptimal objective adherence with PAP; ill-fitting PAP masks; insufficient sleep; poor sleep hygiene; other sleep disorders such as narcolepsy or restless legs syndrome/ periodic limb movements of sleep; and depression".

### Oxygen therapy in sleep-disordered breathing [^115cMfu4]. Chest (2021). Medium credibility.

Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) is highly prevalent in adults and leads to significant cardiovascular and neurologic sequelae. Intermittent hypoxia during sleep is a direct consequence of SDB. Administration of nocturnal supplemental oxygen (NSO) has been used as a therapeutic alternative to positive airway pressure (PAP) in SDB. NSO significantly improves oxygen saturation in OSA but is inferior to PAP in terms of reducing apnea severity and may prolong the duration of obstructive apneas. The effect of NSO on daytime sleepiness remains unclear, but NSO may improve physical function-related quality of life in OSA. Its effects on BP reduction remain inconclusive. The effects of NSO vs PAP in OSA with comorbid COPD (overlap syndrome) are unknown. NSO is effective in reducing central sleep apnea related to congestive heart failure; however, its impact on mortality and cardiovascular clinical outcomes are being investigated in an ongoing clinical trial. In conclusion, studies are inconclusive or limited regarding clinical outcomes with oxygen therapy compared with sham or PAP therapy in patients with OSA and overlap syndrome. Oxygen does mitigate central sleep apnea. This review examines the crucial knowledge gaps and suggests future research priorities to clarify the effects of optimal dose and duration of NSO, alone or in combination with PAP, on cardiovascular, sleep, and cognitive outcomes.

PAP modalities — Recommendation 5 states: We recommend that clinicians use either APAP or CPAP for ongoing treatment of OSA in adults. (STRONG). The TF identified 26 RCTs that investigated the effects of ongoing treatment with APAP compared with fixed CPAP and meta-analyses demonstrated no clinically significant differences between APAP versus CPAP in adherence, self-reported and objective sleepiness, or QOL, with the overall quality of evidence for this recommendation was moderate due to imprecision. Remarks specify: This recommendation is based on studies that mostly excluded patients with the following comorbidities or conditions: congestive heart failure, chronic opiate use, significant lung disease such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, neuromuscular disease, history of uvulopalatopharyngoplasty, sleep-related oxygen requirements or expectation of nocturnal arterial oxyhemoglobin desaturation due to conditions other than OSA, including hypoventilation syndromes and central sleep apnea syndromes. The TF concluded that either APAP or CPAP should be used for ongoing treatment of adult OSA, with the choice of therapy based on patient tolerance, symptom response and other factors.

### The great controversy of obstructive sleep apnea treatment for cardiovascular risk benefit: advancing the science through expert consensus. An official American Thoracic Society workshop report [^111VsG8F]. Annals of the American Thoracic Society (2024). High credibility.

Identifying patients with OSA at increased cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk and potential to respond to PAP — using the apnea–hypopnea index (AHI) alone to infer CVD risk and treatment benefit does not capture OSA heterogeneity and can result in neutral randomized controlled trial results; emerging evidence shows that physiologic OSA-related factors other than AHI can predict composite CVD outcomes and differentiate responses to PAP; the AHI does not effectively capture physiologic disturbances that occur with respiratory events, and for any given AHI there is wide variability in event duration and depth, burden of oxygen desaturation, pulse rate changes, and cortical activity that may differentially contribute to mechanisms linking OSA to CVD; as a result, current randomized controlled trials of PAP for CVD risk reduction might have been underpowered when inclusion was determined solely by AHI; integrating additional factors can enhance understanding of treatment responses and outcomes, and at-risk endotypes and phenotypes can be identified by physiologic responses, symptom subtypes and comorbid sleep disorders, and advanced statistical modeling to enrich future targeted trials.

### Positive airway pressure in surgical patients with sleep apnea: what is the supporting evidence? [^115YXBPH]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2024). Medium credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is prevalent amongst surgical patients and associated with an increased incidence of perioperative complications. The gold standard treatment for moderate-to-severe OSA is positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy. Practice guidelines by the American Society of Anesthesiologists and the Society of Anesthesia and Sleep Medicine have recommended preoperative screening for OSA and consideration of initiation of PAP therapy for patients with severe OSA. These guidelines, developed mainly by the consensus of experts, highlight the adverse impact of OSA on postoperative outcomes and recommend the use of postoperative PAP in surgical patients with moderate to severe OSA. Since the development of these guidelines, there has been an increase in the number of publications regarding the efficacy of PAP therapy in surgical patients with OSA. Our review provides an update on the existing literature on the efficacy of PAP therapy in surgical patients with OSA. We focus on the postoperative complications associated with OSA, potential mechanisms leading to the increased risk of postoperative adverse events, and summarize the perioperative guidelines for the management of patients with OSA, evidence supporting perioperative PAP therapy, as well as limitations to PAP therapy and alternatives. An update on the existing literature of the efficacy of PAP therapy in surgical patients with OSA is critical to assess the impact of prior guidelines, determine when and how to effectively implement PAP therapy, and target barriers to PAP adherence in the perioperative setting.

This guideline establishes clinical practice recommendations for the diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in adults and is intended for use in conjunction with other American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) guidelines on the evaluation and treatment of sleep-disordered breathing in adults.

Methods

The AASM commissioned a task force of experts in sleep medicine. A systematic review was conducted to identify studies, and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) process was used to assess the evidence. The task force developed recommendations and assigned strengths based on the quality of evidence, the balance of benefits and harms, patient values and preferences, and resource use. In addition, the task force adopted foundational recommendations from prior guidelines as "good practice statements", that establish the basis for appropriate and effective diagnosis of OSA. The AASM Board of Directors approved the final recommendations.

Recommendations

The following recommendations are intended as a guide for clinicians diagnosing OSA in adults. Under GRADE, a STRONG recommendation is one that clinicians should follow under most circumstances. A WEAK recommendation reflects a lower degree of certainty regarding the outcome and appropriateness of the patient-care strategy for all patients. The ultimate judgment regarding propriety of any specific care must be made by the clinician in light of the individual circumstances presented by the patient, available diagnostic tools, accessible treatment options, and resources. Good Practice Statements: Diagnostic testing for OSA should be performed in conjunction with a comprehensive sleep evaluation and adequate follow-up. Polysomnography is the standard diagnostic test for the diagnosis of OSA in adult patients in whom there is a concern for OSA based on a comprehensive sleep evaluation. Recommendations: We recommend that clinical tools, questionnaires and prediction algorithms not be used to diagnose OSA in adults, in the absence of polysomnography or home sleep apnea testing. (STRONG). We recommend that polysomnography, or home sleep apnea testing with a technically adequate device, be used for the diagnosis of OSA in uncomplicated adult patients presenting with signs and symptoms that indicate an increased risk of moderate to severe OSA. (STRONG). We recommend that if a single home sleep apnea test is negative, inconclusive, or technically inadequate, polysomnography be performed for the diagnosis of OSA. (STRONG). We recommend that polysomnography, rather than home sleep apnea testing, be used for the diagnosis of OSA in patients with significant cardiorespiratory disease, potential respiratory muscle weakness due to neuromuscular condition, awake hypoventilation or suspicion of sleep related hypoventilation, chronic opioid medication use, history of stroke or severe insomnia. (STRONG). We suggest that, if clinically appropriate, a split-night diagnostic protocol, rather than a full-night diagnostic protocol for polysomnography be used for the diagnosis of OSA. (WEAK). We suggest that when the initial polysomnogram is negative and clinical suspicion for OSA remains, a second polysomnogram be considered for the diagnosis of OSA. (WEAK).

Perioperative use of positive airway pressure in obstructive sleep apnea — matched observational studies and meta-analyses show varied perioperative effects: patients diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) with a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) prescription had reduced cardiovascular adverse events versus undiagnosed OSA (OR = 0.34; 95% CI = 0.15–0.77; P = 0.009), and another study found more cardiopulmonary complications without therapy compared with positive airway pressure (risk-adjusted rates 6.7% vs. 4%; P = 0.001). Meta-analyses including 904 patients suggest postoperative CPAP reduces apnea–hypopnea index (AHI) with a trend to reduced length of stay but no significant impact on postoperative adverse events, with low adherence reported (2.4–4.6 h/night). Despite prescribed therapy, one study reported 18% spent at least 30 minutes with oxygen saturation less than 90% the night after surgery.

### Patient-defined goals for obstructive sleep apnea treatment [^115ZxQ7R]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

In adults with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) who are interested in positive airway pressure (PAP) alternatives, the multiple approaches to effective therapy may present a challenge to patients and providers when selecting a preferred treatment modality. We previously demonstrated high rates of decisional conflict and the potential for decision delay or regret in this population.

Thus, there is a need to improve patient preparedness for decision making and decision quality through better shared decision-making (SDM) processes and tools. Key components of the patient-centered SDM process include understanding patient preferences and treatment goals to enhance patient education, promote patient engagement, and align definitions of optimal outcomes.

One key contributor to decisional conflict is incomplete understanding of, or de-emphasis on, patient-defined goals for pursuing treatment. OSA treatment effectiveness is often measured by changes in disease severity via the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) or symptom scores such as the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). However, focusing solely on these metrics does not capture patient-driven treatment goals or values (eg, cost, convenience, or recovery time), which affect adherence and efficacy. Literature regarding the treatment goals of patients with OSA, especially those seeking surgical treatment, is limited. In this study, we used a mixed methods approach to identify major treatment goal categories in adult patients with OSA. We then assessed patients' the most important treatment goal and characterized the relationships between treatment goals and patient characteristics with a larger-scale cross-sectional survey. This information can be used to guide counseling and help patients select treatments that best meet their individual goals.

Introduction

This guideline establishes clinical practice recommendations for positive airway pressure (PAP) treatment of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in adults and is intended for use in conjunction with other American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) guidelines in the evaluation and treatment of sleep-disordered breathing in adults.

Methods

The AASM commissioned a task force of experts in sleep medicine. A systematic review was conducted to identify studies, and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) process was used to assess the evidence. The task force developed recommendations and assigned strengths based on the quality of evidence, the balance of clinically significant benefits and harms, patient values and preferences, and resource use. In addition, the task force adopted recommendations from prior guidelines as "good practice statements" that establish the basis for appropriate and effective treatment of OSA. The AASM Board of Directors approved the final recommendations.

Good Practice Statements

The following good practice statements are based on expert consensus, and their implementation is necessary for appropriate and effective management of patients with OSA treated with positive airway pressure: (1) Treatment of OSA with PAP therapy should be based on a diagnosis of OSA established using objective sleep apnea testing. (2) Adequate follow-up, including troubleshooting and monitoring of objective efficacy and usage data to ensure adequate treatment and adherence, should occur following PAP therapy initiation and during treatment of OSA.

Recommendations

The following recommendations are intended as a guide for clinicians using PAP to treat OSA in adults. A STRONG (ie, "We recommend… ") recommendation is one that clinicians should follow under most circumstances. A CONDITIONAL recommendation (ie, "We suggest… ") reflects a lower degree of certainty regarding the outcome and appropriateness of the patient-care strategy for all patients. The ultimate judgment regarding any specific care must be made by the treating clinician and the patient, taking into consideration the individual circumstances of the patient, available treatment options, and resources. (1) We recommend that clinicians use PAP, compared to no therapy, to treat OSA in adults with excessive sleepiness. (STRONG) (2) We suggest that clinicians use PAP, compared to no therapy, to treat OSA in adults with impaired sleep-related quality of life. (CONDITIONAL) (3) We suggest that clinicians use PAP, compared to no therapy, to treat OSA in adults with comorbid hypertension. (CONDITIONAL) (4) We recommend that PAP therapy be initiated using either APAP at home or in-laboratory PAP titration in adults with OSA and no significant comorbidities. (STRONG) (5) We recommend that clinicians use either CPAP or APAP for ongoing treatment of OSA in adults. (STRONG) (6) We suggest that clinicians use CPAP or APAP over BPAP in the routine treatment of OSA in adults. (CONDITIONAL) (7) We recommend that educational interventions be given with initiation of PAP therapy in adults with OSA. (STRONG) (8) We suggest that behavioral and/or troubleshooting interventions be given during the initial period of PAP therapy in adults with OSA. (CONDITIONAL) (9) We suggest that clinicians use telemonitoring-guided interventions during the initial period of PAP therapy in adults with OSA. (CONDITIONAL).

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) patient-centered trial design — Table 3 recommends incorporating patients into trial design and governance; refining using an adaptive Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial (SMART) design with modification during the trial to focus on "treatment responders"; considering simplified measurements to define OSA on the basis of home testing such as oxygen desaturation index (ODI); developing and implementing predictors to include participants at higher risk for adverse outcomes; limiting exclusion criteria to include more representative patients and promote generalizability; incorporating patient choice and integrating trials within existing clinical pathways and trusted providers; providing behavioral interventions to support continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) use and creating mechanisms for peer support; exploring active controls and comparative effectiveness with non-CPAP alternatives for treatment of sleepiness and other symptoms; reducing participant burden through fewer surveys/interventions, virtual trial visits, and collecting outcomes from electronic health records (EHRs); and long-term engagement by informing participants of trial results, conducting participant appreciation events, and engaging patient advocacy organizations in dissemination efforts.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a condition of partial or complete upper airway obstruction leading to increased resistance to airflow and potential cessation of breathing during sleep. Effective treatment of OSA is challenging and there has been greater recognition by the medical and dental disciplines. By understanding the rationale, indications, benefits, risks and success of the various treatment options available, clinicians will be able to make more informed treatment recommendations in patient management.

Obstructive sleep apnea diagnosis — For diagnosis of clinically suspected obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), we recommend diagnosis with polysomnography or home sleep apnea testing (Strong for | Reviewed, New-added). The discussion notes that OSA presents itself with a multitude of symptoms but that the basis for the diagnosis and decision about therapy relies on defining pathophysiology, explaining that repetitive narrowing or complete closure of the upper airways during sleep results in reduction or complete cessation of airflow, hypoxia, and sleep fragmentation; it further states that this impaired flow is measured objectively through monitoring of airflow using various validated technology, that consequences are measured and quantified by measuring oxygenation and sleep stages, and that with objective sleep testing different indices of respiratory compromise are generated that will rate the severity of OSA.

### Obstructive sleep apnea and oxygen therapy: a systematic review of the literature and meta-analysis [^115C4hby]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Hypoxemia is an immediate consequence of obstructive sleep apnea. Oxygen (O2) administration has been used as an alternative treatment in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) who do not adhere to continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) in order to reduce the deleterious effects of intermittent hypoxemia during sleep. This systematic review aims to investigate the effects of O2 therapy on patients with OSA.

Method

We conducted a systematic search of the databases Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (1(st) Quarter 2011), Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (from 1950 to February 2011). Our search strategy yielded 4,793 citations. Irrelevant papers were excluded by title and abstract review, leaving 105 manuscripts. We reviewed all prospective studies that included: (1) a target population with obstructive sleep apnea, (2) O2 therapy and/or CPAP as a study intervention, (3) the effects of O2 on the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), nocturnal hypoxemia, or apnea duration.

Results

We identified 14 studies including a total of 359 patients. Nine studies were of single cohort design, while 5 studies were randomized control trials with 3 groups (CPAP, oxygen, and placebo/sham CPAP). When CPAP was compared to O2 therapy, all but one showed a significant improvement in AHI. Ten studies demonstrated that O2 therapy improved oxygen saturation vs. placebo. However, the average duration of apnea and hypopnea episodes were longer in patients receiving O2 therapy than those receiving placebo.

Conclusion

This review shows that O2 therapy significantly improves oxygen saturation in patients with OSA. However, it may also increase the duration of apnea-hypopnea events.

### Patient-defined goals for obstructive sleep apnea treatment [^1179TmJR]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Meanwhile, patients with severe OSA and prior (noncurrent) PAP therapy were more likely to select health risk reduction as primary goal, matching the general understanding that patients with severe and untreated OSA are at higher risk of cardiovascular morbidity than those with mild and treated OSA. Conversely, more patients who had never tried PAP cited improving sleep quality as a primary goal.

Analysis of a subset of patients who pursued drug-induced sleep endoscopy or sleep surgery did not demonstrate an association between primary treatment goals and ultimate decision to pursue these procedures. This finding has been shown in other surgical fields and is expected, as treatment goals and values may change over time and identification of patient treatment goals and values is just one component of the decision-making process.

The findings of this study can be utilized in 3 ways. First, understanding treatment goal categories aids in patient counseling. Advantages and disadvantages of treatment options should be based on the abilities of each modality to achieve or not achieve patient-specific treatment goals. This core discussion is the basis of SDM and defines treatment success that is specific and personalized.

Second, our findings identify gaps in knowledge and research needs. Comparative work is needed to understand each treatment modality's ability to not only improve AHI but also achieve common patient treatment goals of reducing daytime sleepiness, snoring sound, and cardiovascular health risk and improving sleep quality. There is limited long-term comparative objective analysis on the ability of PAP versus oral appliances versus surgery types in reducing or terminating snoring sounds. - Similarly, data on health risk reduction with treatment are controversial. Prospective cohort studies have shown significant risks for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with OSA and risk reduction with PAP therapy.- However, randomized controlled trials have not demonstrated measurable benefits of PAP in reducing cardiovascular risks, though duration of nightly PAP use was low in these studies. In terms of surgical outcomes, a retrospective review of > 54,000 patients with OSA found that soft tissue surgery was associated with lower rates of cardiovascular, neurologic, and endocrine complications as compared with PAP; yet, no prospective controlled studies have examined surgical outcomes. Further studies of OSA treatment outcomes should align with the major patient-defined goals and expectations to allow clinicians to counsel according to factors that matter most to patients.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) management — options, patient-centered selection, and practical metrics are outlined: referral for a surgical evaluation can be considered as an option (e.g., hypoglossal nerve stimulation therapy and treatment of nasal obstruction). Many patients struggle with incorporating OSA therapy into their daily routine and may experience discomfort and sleep disturbance caused by the therapy. Measures of effectiveness (rather than efficacy) such as mean disease alleviation, which integrate efficacy of therapy and adherence, may offer more practical information when comparing treatment options, and a shared decision-making approach that ensures patients understand the pros and cons of their OSA treatment options should be used to align OSA therapy with a patient's goals and treatment preferences.

Results

Phase 1: Semistructured Interviews

Eight focus groups with 20 patients newly diagnosed with OSA (treatment naïve) and 8 interviews with patients who had undergone prior therapy (history of treatment) were completed (Table 1). Analysis of goals for OSA therapy identified 9 subthemes (Table 2). The most common treatment goals were improving daytime sleepiness, reducing health risk with focus on cardiovascular health, improving sleep quality (depth and restfulness), and improving snoring sounds (reduction or termination).

Table 2.
Treatment Goal Themes Identified During Semistructured Interviews. a

All of the "history of treatment" group and 70% of the treatment-naïve group cited improving daytime sleepiness and fatigue as a major treatment goal. Effects of daytime sleepiness included impact on professional life, work performance, and safety while driving.

Improved health was another common treatment goal between the groups. Patients were most concerned about the cardiovascular effects of untreated OSA ("I don't want to. have a heart attack"). Important sleep quality considerations included achieving more restful sleep ("not just light, sensitive sleep"), waking up feeling refreshed ("I can hardly drag myself out of bed"), and improving daytime headaches.

One-third of participants wished to reduce snoring associated with OSA, with some individuals describing this as their most important goal. Some wanted to unburden their bed partners or noted negative social pressures.

When factors or values important in treatment decisions were discussed, 5 major themes arose in both groups: efficacy, cost, convenience, comfort, and aversion to surgery (Table 3). Cost considerations were important to 50% of the treatment-naïve cohort but not mentioned by patients with history of treatment". Convenience was a motivator ("I'll pay anything. [so] you don't have any mask to wear"). Many patients perceived PAP as burdensome ("another thing on my to do list everyday"). Treatment-naïve patients had concerns about PAP comfort ("wondering about getting used to this machine"). In the "history of treatment" group, patients shared experiences with discomfort related to PAP and oral appliance use ("very uncomfortable for my jaw and my teeth"). The majority of patients in the treatment-naïve group expressed an aversion to surgery and a desire to start with PAP therapy. However, no patients who had prior treatment shared this concern.

Table 5.
Primary Treatment Goal Distributions by Participant Subgroups.

Post hoc comparisons of the most important treatment goal selections were performed based on OSA severity defined by AHI groups < 5, 5 to < 15 (mild), 15 to < 30 (moderate), and ≥ 30 (severe). Primary treatment goal distributions differed significantly among AHI groups (P < .00001; Figure 1). Choice of health risk reduction as a primary treatment goal was selected at higher rates in those with severe OSA when compared to those with mild OSA and an AHI < 5. All OSA groups chose health risk reduction at higher rates than the group with an AHI < 5 (10%): mild OSA, 25% (P = 0.043); moderate OSA, 36% (P = 0.001); and severe OSA, 46% (P < .0001).

Figure 1.
Primary treatment goal distributions by apnea-hypopnea index (AHI). Obstructive sleep apnea severity was associated with more patients choosing health risk reduction as their primary goal and fewer choosing snoring sound reduction. ✱ p < .05.

In comparison, a higher proportion of the group with an AHI < 5 chose snoring reduction as a primary treatment goal (38%) than patients with moderate OSA (12%, P = 0.0002) and severe OSA (7%, P < .00001). Similarly, a higher proportion of patients with mild OSA (24%) selected snoring reduction as most important versus patients with moderate OSA (P = 0.028) and severe OSA (P = 0.0001). No differences were found by AHI group in those who chose sleep quality or daytime sleepiness improvement as the primary goal.

A comparison of the most important treatment goal was performed by history of PAP therapy. More patients without prior PAP use selected improving sleep quality (34%), while patients who had previously used but were not currently using PAP chose reducing health risk (45%). Patients using PAP were equally interested in sleep quality improvement (36%) and health risk reduction (37%; Table 5). On analysis of patients using PAP with an AHI ≥ 5 (n = 118), primary treatment goals differed among the mild, moderate, and severe OSA groups (P = 0.0007). Of current PAP users, health risk reduction was selected as the primary treatment goal by 44% of patients with severe OSA, whereas improving sleep quality was selected by 44% of patients with moderate OSA.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) syndrome is a destructive and insidious entity mostly underdiagnosed and undertreated. It affects not only individuals but the society as a whole. The costs to the populations can be measured not only in morbidity and mortality but also in the financial wellbeing of a society. Financial burden of this disease is staggering. The social fabric of society is also greatly impacted. Physiologic effects of OSA are far reaching. It has been shown that early intervention with treatment of OSA can often prevent and/or reverse many of the negative outcomes associated with this condition.

Overview of Sleep Apnea

Definition

Sleep apnea is characterized by repetitive episodes of apnea occurring during sleep. An apnea is defined as a cessation of inspiratory airflow lasting 10 seconds or more, while the term hypopnea refers to a reduction in inspiratory airflow (by at least 30%) lasting 10 seconds or more with an associated drop in oxygen saturation or arousal from sleep. 7 The steps required for a successful inspiratory cycle include activation of a signal from the regulatory brainstem center, transmission of the signal via peripheral nerves, activation of respiratory muscles to produce negative intrathoracic pressure, and a patent airway. The mechanism for apneas or hypopneas can be either obstructive, in which airflow cessation results despite inspiratory effort because of blockage within the upper airways, or central, in which both airflow and inspiratory efforts are absent. The term sleep‐disordered breathing (SDB) encompasses OSA, central (CSA), and mixed apnea, the latter of which shows absent respiratory effort initially and clear effort with obstruction and the end of mixed apnea.

Important risk factors for OSA include obesity, craniofacial or oropharyngeal anatomic abnormalities, male sex, and smoking. 8 During sleep, there is a reduction in tone of the dilator muscles involved in maintaining airway patency. In particular, relaxation of the genioglossus muscle allows the tongue to fall posteriorly within the pharynx, facilitating obstruction in susceptible individuals. 9 Anatomic factors including obesity that result in relative narrowing of the airway lumen increase the likelihood of obstruction. The observation that OSA also affects nonobese patients without identifiable anatomic abnormalities indicates that nonanatomic mechanisms are important as well. Examples of these include ventilatory control instability 10 and reduced sleep arousal threshold. 11 The relative contribution from these processes varies between individual patients, with potential therapeutic implications. A better understanding of the mechanisms underlying OSA could facilitate more personalized therapeutic strategies in the future.

CSA results from transient failure of respiratory control centers in the medulla to trigger inspiration. The primary mechanism is thought to be abnormal regulation of the apneic threshold, the partial pressure of CO 2 below which respiration is suppressed, although depending on the underlying cause CSA patients can be either hypercapnic, eucapnic, or hypocapnic. 9 HF is one of the leading causes of CSA, associated in particular with Cheyne‐Stokes breathing, which is characterized by cyclic crescendo‐decrescendo respiratory efforts and hypocapnia. 12

Oxygen therapy for CSA in heart failure (HF) has limited symptomatic benefit but is conditionally supported: several small RCTs and observational studies evaluated low flow oxygen, most with at least eight weeks of follow up and no reported benefits in sleepiness, insomnia, or exercise performance; individual response should be re-evaluated before prescribing oxygen over the long term; coverage may be limited; and the task force provided a low certainty recommendation in favor of using low flow oxygen for CSA in HF.

### Practice guidelines for the perioperative management of patients with obstructive sleep apnea: an updated report by the American society of anesthesiologists task force on perioperative management of patients with obstructive sleep apnea [^115Qq2oj]. Anesthesiology (2014). Medium credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) outpatient discharge and monitoring — beyond standard criteria, consultants 'agree that room air oxygen saturation should return to its baseline' and 'strongly agree that patients should not become hypoxemic or have development of clinical airway obstruction when left unstimulated in the recovery area'; they indicated that 'patients with OSA should be monitored for a median of 3 h longer than their non-OSA counterparts' before discharge and that monitoring 'should continue for a median of 7 h after the last episode of airway obstruction or hypoxemia while breathing room air in an unstimulating environment'.

### Practice guidelines for the perioperative management of patients with obstructive sleep apnea: an updated report by the American society of anesthesiologists task force on perioperative management of patients with obstructive sleep apnea [^113qF9EG]. Anesthesiology (2014). Medium credibility.

Oxygenation and positive airway pressure in OSA — consultant opinions and Task Force recommendations include that the consultants agree that supplemental oxygen should be administered as needed to maintain acceptable arterial oxygen saturation and that supplemental oxygen may be discontinued when patients are able to maintain their baseline oxygen saturation while breathing room air; the consultants strongly agree that CPAP or NIPPV should be administered as soon as feasible after surgery to patients who were receiving it preoperatively, but they are equivocal regarding instituting CPAP or NIPPV in previously untreated patients, and the literature supports the efficacy of CPAP in nonperioperative settings. Supplemental oxygen should be administered continuously to all patients who are at increased perioperative risk from OSA until they are able to maintain their baseline oxygen saturation while breathing room air, and the Task Force cautions that supplemental oxygen may increase the duration of apneic episodes and may hinder detection of atelectasis, transient apnea, and hypoventilation by pulse oximetry.

### Knowledge gaps in the perioperative management of adults with obstructive sleep apnea and obesity hypoventilation syndrome. An official American Thoracic Society workshop report [^114nG11k]. Annals of the American Thoracic Society (2018). Medium credibility.

Screening for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in surgical patients — tools used include the STOP-Bang score, perioperative sleep apnea prediction score, Berlin questionnaire, and American Society of Anesthesiologists checklist. A STOP-Bang score of 3 or greater has high sensitivity and modest specificity for OSA and is associated with an increased risk of perioperative complications, and use of a higher STOP-Bang threshold (e.g., ≥ 5) may be more appropriate in lower-prevalence populations. The utility of confirmatory testing in patients identified at high risk of OSA or OHS during preoperative screening is unclear; PSG is often challenging to schedule before surgery, and ambulatory technologies may be more useful, and should be studied in this context. Screening should prioritize identifying patients at increased risk of postoperative complications rather than OSA per se; integrating other clinical aspects into screening tools should be considered, and screening questionnaires should be considered strategically for those with a moderate/high or low pretest probability of disease depending on whether the goal is to confirm or exclude disease. In the PACU, recurrent "events" defined as apnea, bradypnea, oxygen desaturation, or pain sedation mismatch in two of three 30-min evaluation periods in patients at high risk of OSA were associated with postoperative respiratory complications including ICU admissions for a respiratory indication, need for respiratory therapy beyond standard postoperative clinical practice, need for noninvasive ventilatory support, or development of postoperative pneumonia.

### Clinical guideline for the evaluation, management and long-term care of obstructive sleep apnea in adults [^1131MXfE]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2009). Medium credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in adults — diagnostic definitions and thresholds are specified as follows: Clinically, OSA is defined by daytime sleepiness, loud snoring, witnessed breathing interruptions, or awakening due to gasping or choking in the presence of at least 5 obstructive respiratory events (apneas, hypopneas or respiratory effort related arousals) per hour of sleep, and the presence of 15 or more obstructive respiratory events per hour of sleep in the absence of sleep related symptoms is also sufficient for diagnosis. Epidemiologically, OSA affects at least 2% to 4% of the adult population.

### Clinical practice guideline for the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea and snoring with oral appliance therapy: an update for 2015 [^113HYGFd]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

4.2b recommendation — oral appliances as an option when CPAP is not tolerated or an alternative is preferred: We recommend that sleep physicians consider prescription of oral appliances, rather than no treatment, for adult patients with obstructive sleep apnea who are intolerant of CPAP therapy or prefer alternate therapy. Values and trade-offs note that CPAP is superior to OAs in the measured outcomes and, therefore, should be the first-line option for treating OSA, although a review of the evidence suggests that adherence rates using OAs are greater than those observed with CPAP and no randomized controlled trials have assessed objective OA adherence rate as compared with CPAP. OAs reduce AHI, arousal index, oxygen desaturation index, and increase oxygen saturation; however, OAs have no significant effect on sleep architecture and sleep efficiency, and the use of OAs in adult patients with OSA should result in an improvement in daily function and quality of life. Although OAs improve physiologic sleep parameters, CPAP appears, in both meta-analyses, to be superior to OAs in reducing the AHI, arousal index, and oxygen desaturation index and in improving oxygen saturation, and therefore should still generally be the first-line option for treating OSA. The available data regarding the impact of OAs on blood pressure are more limited than with CPAP, yet available data suggest that OAs may be as effective as CPAP in at least select patient populations to lower blood pressure.

### Patient-defined goals for obstructive sleep apnea treatment [^114eaEuD]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Third, characterization of common treatment goals is the first step in designing decision tools to help with the education and decision-making process. Treatment goals for adult OSA are often considered only in the context of objective metrics such as AHI, symptom inventories (ie, ESS), and impact on associated comorbidities. As recently noted by Malhotra et al, the chief complaint of the patient with OSA may too often be overlooked. Prior studies have demonstrated that patient and provider goals in recommending or selecting an optimal treatment frequently conflict. Thus, it is important to respect patient perspectives in consideration of treatment outcomes and incorporate these into development of SDM tools (ie, decision aids). Patient-defined treatment goals may also be used to define treatment success and, when not achieved, to serve as an impetus to consider other treatment modalities in a comprehensive approach.

This study has a few limitations. It was conducted with patients recruited from two sites within the San Francisco Bay Area. Thus, differences in findings between the treatment-naïve and "history of treatment" groups may be influenced by the disparate populations based on location. Regional and socioeconomic effects on the findings were not analyzed, limiting generalizability of the results. In addition, our survey focused on the four most commonly cited treatment goals from semistructured interviews with patients with OSA, and patients may have primary treatment goals beyond these. Future studies are needed to evaluate treatment goals specific to patients who undergo sleep surgery and to understand roles of multiple goals in surgical decision making. Future work should also investigate the influence of prior patient education and research on treatment goals and decision making.

### More than the sum of the respiratory events: personalized medicine approaches for obstructive sleep apnea [^113hgErL]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Traditionally, the presence and severity of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) have been defined by the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI). Continuous positive airway pressure is generally first-line therapy despite low adherence, because it reliably reduces the AHI when used, and the response to other therapies is variable. However, there is growing appreciation that the underlying etiology (i.e., endotype) and clinical manifestation (i.e., phenotype) of OSA in an individual are not well described by the AHI. We define and review the important progress made in understanding and measuring physiological mechanisms (or endotypes) that help define subtypes of OSA and identify the potential use of genetics to further refine disease classification. This more detailed understanding of OSA pathogenesis should influence clinical treatment decisions as well as help inform research priorities and clinical study design. In short, treatments could be individualized on the basis of the underlying cause of OSA; patients could better understand which symptoms and outcomes will respond to OSA treatment and by how much; and researchers could select populations most likely to benefit from specific treatment approaches for OSA.

### Prevalence… [^11552qVK]. AAFP (2016). Low credibility.

1 Patients with OSA temporarily stop or decrease their breathing repeatedly during sleep. 2–5 This cessation or decrease in breathing is the result of repetitive partial or complete obstruction of the airway caused by narrowing of the respiratory passages. 4, 6–8 These breathing disruptions can awaken a person or prevent deep, restful sleep. The effects of fragmented sleep on daytime fatigue and sleepiness are widely recognized. 3, 6. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION POLYSOMNOGRAPHY Sleep studies performed in a sleep laboratory or in the home can quantify the apnea-hypopnea index, which is required to diagnose OSA. Apnea is a complete obstruction of airflow, and hypopnea is a partial obstruction of airflow; both must last a minimum of 10 seconds. Hypopneas are measured by oxygen desaturation of 3% or more or arousal from sleep.

35 Although a decrease in weight has been shown to decrease critical closing pressures of the airway, there are inconsistent findings on the association between weight reduction and overall improvement in sleep and breathing patterns. 36 Studies have shown that sleeping in the supine position compared with the lateral position may double the apnea-hypopnea index in patients with OSA. POSITIVE AIRWAY PRESSURE Positive pressure therapies include continuous positive airway pressure, bilevel positive airway pressure, and auto-titrating positive airway pressure. CPAP is effective and remains the first-line treatment for OSA. CPAP works via pneumatic splinting of the upper airways. Airway pressure may be applied through oral, oronasal, and nasal devices.

CPAP has not only been shown to improve quality-of-life and sleep indices in patients with OSA, but also to lower blood pressure and rates of arrhythmia and stroke, to improve left ventricular ejection fraction in patients with heart failure, and to improve the rates of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events. 52 Mandibular advancement devices are preferred because there is insufficient evidence on the effectiveness of tongue-retaining devices. Newer devices such as oral pressure therapy, which uses a mouthpiece and a vacuum pump to stabilize upper airway tissue, are being studied. 53 CPAP has been shown to be superior to oral appliances in reducing apnea-hypopnea indices, arousal indices, and oxygen desaturation, particularly in patients with moderate to severe OSA, although quality-of-life indices appear to be similar to oral appliances.

### Optimal NIV Medicare access promotion: patients with central sleep apnea: a technical expert panel report from the American College of Chest Physicians, the American Association for Respiratory Care, the American Academy of Sleep Medicine, and the American Thoracic Society [^111ya7yv]. Chest (2021). Medium credibility.

This document summarizes suggestions of the central sleep apnea (CSA) Technical Expert Panel working group. This paper shares our vision for bringing the right device to the right patient at the right time. For patients with CSA, current coverage criteria do not align with guideline treatment recommendations. For example, CPAP and oxygen therapy are recommended but not covered for CSA. On the other hand, bilevel positive airway pressure (BPAP) without a backup rate may be a covered therapy for OSA, but it may worsen CSA. Narrow coverage criteria that require near elimination of obstructive breathing events on CPAP or BPAP in the spontaneous mode, even if at poorly tolerated pressure levels, may preclude therapy with BPAP with backup rate or adaptive servoventilation, even when those devices provide demonstrably better therapy. CSA is a dynamic disorder that may require different treatments over time, sometimes switching from one device to another; an example is switching from BPAP with backup rate to an adaptive servoventilation with automatic end-expiratory pressure adjustments, which may not be covered. To address these challenges, we suggest several changes to the coverage determinations, including: (1) a single simplified initial and continuing coverage definition of CSA that aligns with OSA; (2) removal of hypoventilation terminology from coverage criteria for CSA; (3) all effective therapies for CSA should be covered, including oxygen and all PAP devices with or without backup rates or servo-mechanisms; and (4) patients shown to have a suboptimal response to one PAP device should be allowed to add oxygen or change to another PAP device with different capabilities if shown to be effective with testing.

### Clinical guidelines for the manual titration of positive airway pressure in patients with obstructive sleep apnea [^117BG59e]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2008). Medium credibility.

Positive airway pressure titration — criteria to add supplemental oxygen — Supplemental O2 should be added during PAP titration when the patient's awake supine SpO2 while breathing room air is ≤ 88%, and may also be added when SpO2 is ≤ 88% for ≥ 5 minutes in the absence of obstructive respiratory events; in both instances, O2 should be introduced at 1 L/min and titrated to achieve a target SpO2 between 88% and 94% (Consensus). The minimum starting O2 rate should be 1 L/min (both pediatric and adult patients) (Consensus).
