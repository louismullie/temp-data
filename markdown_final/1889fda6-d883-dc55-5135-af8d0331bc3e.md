## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which criterion a competitive firm should use to decide whether to shut down in the short run. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the distinction between short-run versus long-run decision horizons. Then, I should verify which cost concepts are fixed versus variable in the short run. Next, I will examine the shutdown rule and why it focuses on variable costs rather than total costs. After that, I should review each answer choice against the shutdown logic. Finally, I will confirm the correct choice and briefly state the economic intuition behind it.

> Let me first confirm the decision horizon. In the short run, some inputs are fixed and some are variable, so fixed costs are sunk and irrelevant to the shutdown decision, whereas in the long run all costs are variable and the firm exits if total revenue does not cover total costs. This means the short-run shutdown rule is not the same as the long-run exit rule, and I need to ensure I'm applying the short-run logic here.

> I need to check which costs matter for shutdown. In the short run, total fixed cost (TFC) is sunk and must be paid whether the firm produces or not, so the firm should continue to operate if total revenue (TR) covers total variable cost (TVC), and shut down if TR is less than TVC. This is equivalent to saying: shut down if price is less than average variable cost (AVC), because for a competitive firm price equals marginal revenue (MR).

> Now, let me examine Option A: compare AVC to MR. Wait, let me verify the equivalence. Since P = MR in perfect competition, comparing MR to AVC is the same as comparing P to AVC, which is exactly the short-run shutdown rule. If P (or MR) is less than AVC, the firm loses money on each unit beyond its variable costs and should shut down; if P is greater than or equal to AVC, the firm should continue operating even if it is not covering total costs, because it is contributing something toward fixed costs. This aligns with the core shutdown logic.

> Next, I should review Option B: compare TR to TC. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. That sounds like the long-run exit rule, not the short-run shutdown rule. In the short run, a firm can have TR < TC yet still operate if TR ≥ TVC, because operating limits losses to TFC, whereas shutting down means losing all of TFC. So TR versus TC is the wrong benchmark for a short-run shutdown decision.

> I will now examine Option C: do not produce if TFC is not covered by revenue. Hmm, wait a minute, that conflates fixed and variable costs. Fixed costs are sunk in the short run; the firm should not shut down just because TR fails to cover TFC, as long as TR covers TVC. Shutting down when TR < TFC but TR ≥ TVC would increase losses, so this option is incorrect for short-run shutdown logic.

> Let me consider Option D: produce the highest quantity demanded regardless of price. I should double-check the implication. This ignores cost entirely and would lead the firm to produce even when price is below AVC, which would increase losses. The shutdown rule explicitly tells the firm to produce zero when price is below AVC, so this option contradicts profit-maximizing behavior in the short run.

> Putting this together, I should confirm the correct choice. The most important consideration for a competitive firm's short-run shutdown decision is to compare AVC to MR (or equivalently, P to AVC), and shut down if MR < AVC. This ensures the firm avoids operating at a loss on variable costs and limits losses to fixed costs when continued operation would worsen the bottom line.

> Final answer: A. Compare AVC to MR.

The most important factor for a competitive firm deciding whether to shut down in the short run is whether **price covers average variable cost (AVC)**. If price is below AVC, the firm should shut down because it cannot cover its variable costs and would lose more by operating than by shutting down. If price is at or above AVC, the firm should continue operating, even if it incurs a loss, because it can cover variable costs and contribute to fixed costs. Options B, C, and D are incorrect because they either mix short-run and long-run decision rules or ignore variable cost coverage.

---

## Short-run shutdown rule

In the short run, a competitive firm should **shut down if price (P) is less than average variable cost (AVC)** [^notfound]. This is because:

- **Variable costs**: These are costs that vary with output (e.g. raw materials, labor). If the firm cannot cover these costs, it loses money on each unit produced.

- **Fixed costs**: These are costs that do not vary with output (e.g. rent, equipment). In the short run, fixed costs are sunk and must be paid regardless of production.

- **Decision rule**: If P < AVC, the firm's loss from operating exceeds its loss from shutting down (where it only incurs fixed costs). Thus, shutting down minimizes losses [^notfound].

---

## Why other options are incorrect

### Option B: Compare total revenue (TR) to total cost (TC)

This is a **long-run decision rule**. In the long run, a firm should exit if TR < TC because all costs (including fixed costs) must be covered. In the short run, fixed costs are sunk, so this comparison is irrelevant to the shutdown decision [^notfound].

---

### Option C: Do not produce if total fixed cost (TFC) is not covered by revenue

This is **incorrect** because fixed costs are sunk in the short run. The firm should continue operating if revenue covers variable costs, even if it does not cover fixed costs [^notfound].

---

### Option D: Produce the highest quantity demanded regardless of price

This is **incorrect** because it ignores cost considerations. Producing at a loss (when P < AVC) increases losses and is not rational [^notfound].

---

## Graphical illustration

The graph below illustrates the **shutdown rule**: the firm should shut down if price falls below AVC, as operating would increase losses.

| **Price level** | **Firm's decision** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| P > AVC | Operate | Covers variable costs and contributes to fixed costs |
| P = AVC | Indifferent | Covers variable costs only |
| P < AVC | Shut down | Cannot cover variable costs; greater loss if operating |

---

## Conclusion

The most important consideration for a competitive firm deciding whether to shut down in the short run is whether **price covers average variable cost (AVC)** [^notfound]. If price is below AVC, the firm should shut down; if price is at or above AVC, the firm should continue operating. This rule minimizes losses by ensuring the firm only produces when it can cover its variable costs [^notfound].

### Blue food demand across geographic and temporal scales [^114rp6EU]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Consumers diversify food expenditures according to price and quality as their incomes increase, spending less of their budget on staple foods and more on luxury items. Income elasticities of demand are thus greater for high market-valued foods, including aquatic and terrestrial animal products, than for low market-valued staple foods –. Since some wild fish are used for fishmeal and fish oil in animal feeds, demand for fish as a feed ingredient is expected to rise with per capita income growth. These relationships provide a foundation for assessing both time series and cross-sectional trends in blue food demand within the global food system.

The availability and affordability of blue foods also influence demand. Small island nations with an abundance of wild fish in their ocean territories record especially high per capita fish consumption (Supplementary Table 1). In other regions, particularly throughout Asia, the expansion of aquaculture has driven down real prices for farmed fish produced in large volumes, making them increasingly accessible to low-income consumers. Meanwhile, wild capture fish have become more expensive, both in real terms and relative to farmed fish, often restricting their accessibility to wealthier consumers –. Our projections of future demand assume that producers are able to supply the quantity of fish demanded at constant real prices (see "Methods"), a plausible assumption given the steady growth in global aquaculture production –. Climate change raises significant uncertainties surrounding this assumption, however, as described in the Discussion section.

### Carbon pricing drives critical transition to green growth [^116fakhg]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

This is equal to the highest wage for which the producer does not make a loss based on the average level of labor productivity and the selling price. So, for consumer good producers andfor capital good producers.

The labor market matching then started with all these job-seeking households and labor-seeking producers. For each labor-seeking producer, a job-seeking queue is generated consisting of a random sample of job-seeking households. The effective labor amount each household offers is given by its productivity level and its labor amount as π i L i. The producer will then go down the queue and hire the household i if π i L i ≤ Δ L d until its labor demand is satisfied or the queue has run out of households. If π i, t L i, t > Δ L d but Δ L d > 0, the employer will look further in the queue for an employee with less offered labor supply.

Note that employers pay w i, t L i to employee i, which does not take into account the employee's productivity level π i. Hence, employees effectively pay w i, t / π i per unit of labor, which is taken into account by employers when hiring and firing employees. Firstly, the offered wageis compared to the effective requested wage. Secondly, employers will fire employees by order of their relative wage (i.e. highest to lowest w i, t / π i), instead of based on the nominal wage. This has the important implication that highly productive employees can request and maintain a higher wage than employees with low productivity. As such, the addition of labor productivity heterogeneity allows for a wage distribution that is endogenously unequal. This will be further discussed in "The Money Supply".

### Is the price right? Paying for value today to get more value tomorrow [^112JhTiY]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

In this article, we aim to provide a viewpoint on several critical aspects of the economics of the pharmaceutical industry. Firstly, we underscore that adequate expected financial returns are necessary to incentivize companies and investors to fund the R&D efforts that are essential to biomedical progress. As pharmaceutical R&D efforts are costly and risky, a promising compound is considered worth investing in when the expected financial return, which we can simplify to the product to two factors — the probability of success and financial value of success — exceeds the cost of development. Of course, prices are just one component of the expected return: sales volume also matters. In addition, investors also need to consider the long-term price trajectory and pricing dynamics following a drug's launch, which depend on its patent life and competing products. Expected returns are also affected by the cost of making and distributing the drug, as well as public tax policies. When the expected return is too low, either because the price is too low, the volume is too low, the cost of production or distribution is too high, or the duration of adequate pricing is too short, investors stay away, seeking returns elsewhere in the economy.

Pricing as a reflection of value

Pricing based on the R&D costs of one approved molecule does not account for all the others that did not make it to the market. Additionally, while we tend to focus on the successful products in the existing R&D ecosystem, the literature has shown that both successful and failed R&D efforts have generated important scientific knowledge that has improved the efficiency of our R&D system. Put simply, it is impossible to innovate without failure, and it is important to recognize that failures are valuable, too, because what we learn — as an R&D ecosystem — from our failures helps us to eventually succeed.

If we agree that providing sufficient rewards is essential to incentivize biopharmaceutical R&D, what should society pay? Firstly, this may seem a strange question to those who operate in the actual market-based system, because the answer they often encounter is that payers try to pay as little as possible. If faced with enough choices, payers, specifically PBMs in the USA, can simply play companies off against one another and take the best offers. Understandably pre-occupied with their own priorities, none of these individual payers is directly concerned with rewarding innovation from the societal perspective. Innovators are constantly trying to invent something uniquely useful in the hope that they will not face too much competition and will therefore have pricing power. In other words, they want to be able to control the supply of a product that buyers want badly enough to pay the price that the innovator sets, and even where there are a few competitors, companies tend to be savvy enough not to trigger a ruinous price war, which is why it often takes loss of exclusivity and many generic competitors entering the market to drive a drug's price down steeply.

### Prospects for global sustainable development through integrating the environmental impacts of economic activities [^113AheaR]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

The demand structure of the model assumes that each country's consumers have a CES utility function. In this case, consumers can choose between domestically produced or imported tradable goods (agriculture, manufacturing) and domestically non-tradable goods (services). It is assumed that there is imperfect substitution between domestic and imported products, following the Armington assumption, meaning that products from different countries are heterogeneous.

The equilibrium in product and factor markets determines the prices of products and factors. Trade costs exist for imports and exports between countries, with tariff barriers being an essential source of trade costs. Specifically, this is reflected in import tariffs (referred to as tariffs) imposed by individual countries. Tariffs affect consumer consumption decisions and firm production decisions through price transmission mechanisms. The import tariff rate for countryimporting productfrom countries is denoted as. The price transmission mechanism is defined as follows:

In the above equation, represents the consumer price of productproduced by countryand consumed by country.represents the production price of productproduced by country.

The model equilibrium is determined by the simultaneous clearing of product markets, factor markets, global trade, and the condition of zero profits in a perfectly competitive market environment. Specifically, under product market clearing, all output is fully consumed, meaning that all produced goods are consumed. Under factor market clearing, the supply of factors equals the demand for factors, ensuring that the quantity of factors supplied matches the quantity demanded. Under trade clearing, global trade is balanced, with the sum of trade imbalances across countries equaling zero. Under the zero-profit condition, the value of production equals the cost of the input factors, ensuring no economic profits in the model. Table 3 provides specific mathematical expressions for market clearing.

### Blue food demand across geographic and temporal scales [^113vm6JM]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Projected demand to 2050

Projected demand in global food market analyses is commonly drawn from demand-supply equilibrium models. This paper, by contrast, focuses on the demand side only and uses current species-group consumption, population growth, predicted GDP PPP per capita growth inclusive of recent estimates of COVID-19 impacts –, and income elasticities. Our model does not account for projected changes in income distribution. We assume a perfectly elastic supply of fish; that is, producers are able to meet demand at a constant price in any given period. The model does not include own- and cross-price elasticities and thus focuses specifically on quantity shifts in demand as opposed to both quantity and price dynamics.

To highlight the composition of blue foods and predicted consumption within countries and to retain global comparisons, our model is built for the selected 10 countries in our regional comparison set. Since we are interested in exploring how non-price determinants such as income and population growths influence blue foods consumption, the model is specified as follows:Where, consumption in country i for species s in time period t+1, is based on consumption for the species in the previous time period, population growthand income growthscales by the income elasticityspecific to the species s in the country i in time period t. Income elasticities of demand for food reflect the responsiveness of demand to changes in income and are calculated as the percent change in the quantity demanded for good s divided by the percent change in income for a given time period t and consumer population.

### Balancing a sustained pursuit of nutrition, health, affordability and climate goals: exploring the case of Indonesia [^11688gzR]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2021). Medium credibility.

There are a number of areas that policy-makers in Indonesia should focus on in order to improve food supply and demand towards diets that prevent malnutrition, are affordable, and limit the environmental impact.

First, the consumption of large quantities of rice and increasing consumption of unhealthy foods preclude inclusion of sufficient amounts of diverse, healthy foods. Also, from an affordability perspective, spending on rice and unhealthy foods prevents spending on diverse, healthy foods.

Secondly, food production and trade should prioritize diversification in order to increase supplies of nutritious and healthy foods and lower their prices, as well as the price of rice. Meanwhile, foods should be produced, processed, transported, and stored in the least environmentally taxing way; biofortifiation and postharvest fortification should be prioritized; and GHGe and other environmental impacts from animal-source foods should be limited through a focus on production of specific animal-source foods, including further development of fish and seafood production; increased consumption of low food chain species; optimization and regulation of the ways in which animal-source foods are produced; and development of production targets for moderate consumption.

Thirdly, demand for more diverse diets can be stimulated by lowering the prices of healthy, nutritious foods and increasing those of unhealthy foods high in sugar, fat, and/or salt: for example, through taxes, incentives/disincentives, or other fiscal and regulatory measures. Furthermore, consumers need to be nudged towards healthy choices within their food environment, provided with guidance by nutrition and health professionals, and inspired by influencers. Social and behavior change strategies, as well as food-based dietary guidelines, should include specific messages about higher needs for certain foods, such as animal-source foods, during specific phases of the life cycle. Institutional demand that supports lower-income consumers, such as through school meals and commodity-specific social assistance transfers, should also prioritize contributing to meeting nutrient needs.

Deciding how to manage the trade-offs of transforming Indonesia's food supply and consumption towards nutritious, healthy, affordable, and sustainable diets requires high-level government commitment and also 1) gathering more granular data on dietary intakes, regional variation of food prices and food expenditures, and food production's environmental burdens beyond GHGe and water footprints; 2) developing a tool that allows for concurrent review and optimization of dietary scenarios across environmental, nutrition, dietary preference, and affordability targets; and 3) assessing the feasibility of producing projected quantities of foods in proposed ways.

The long-term desired production determines investments in the capital stock.is equal to the expected production level, which is obtained using an adaptive expectation scheme:The desired capital stockis then equal to the expected long-term production quantity, which sets the period's desired expansionary investment equal to. Consumer good producers also make a choice for replacing capital goods, either because they exceed their economic lifetime η, or because buying a new machine is cheaper than running the current one. For this, producers compare the cost of running the machine with the cost of buying a new machine from the known producers:Here, b is the payback period, p h the price of a machine of type h and c h the cost of running it. This cost includes energy costs and taxes on energy use and carbon emissions:When assessing the replacement investments, producers assess all the machine versions in their machine stock Ξ i, t and replace if, where p *, c * are the price and cost of the newly offered machine, or when the machine's age exceeds its economic age η.

### Modeling interconnected minerals markets with multicommodity supply curves: examining the copper-cobalt-nickel system [^112sp83E]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

These results demonstrate a characteristic of supply and demand curve relationships across multiple commodities. Considering the demand shifter as a measure of willingness to pay, economic theory indicates that increasing the host commodity willingness to pay should increase the host commodity price and production, while also increasing by-product commodity production and thus decreasing by-product commodity price, all else equal. This work validates these expectations and expands on the theory above: increasing the copper demand shifter raises its demand curve, producing an increase in copper production (Fig. 3e) and an increase in copper price (Fig. 4e). This increase also raises cobalt production (Fig. 3d), but produces a decrease in cobalt price (Fig. 4d). The decreasing cobalt price is noteworthy and has not been previously explained, despite occurring in both the 2D and 4D cases. An increase in the copper demand shifter raises copper price and production, increasing copper revenues for all mines producing it and acting as a credit for copper-cobalt mines, lowering the cobalt price needed for positive free cash flow. All copper-cobalt mines shift lower on the cobalt supply curve, enabling higher cobalt production and lower price for the same cobalt demand curve. The nickel demand shifter produces similar cobalt outcomes (Figs. 3g and 4g).

### Over-exploitation of natural resources is followed by inevitable declines in economic growth and discount rate [^113TMXBm]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Table 1
Table of symbols

In turn, note that there are several candidates for quantifying the social rate of discount, including the consumption rate of discount and the social and private rates of return to investment. These three quantities are closely-related, and, in a perfectly competitive market, they become equal and reflect the marginal productivity of capital. In this study, as in numerous related studies, the focus is on the consumption rate of discount, which is the rate of decline in the marginal contribution of consumption to social welfare. In other words, the corresponding discount factor specifies how many units of consumption added at present would have the same effect on social welfare as a single unit added at time t. In turn when the welfare depends on multiple goods, the discount may depend on the particular good that the policymaker considers. (This simply reflects the relative price changes of the goods.) Therefore, to define discount in our system, we consider a small, marginal perturbation to both c and f. Specifically, we consider a given currency unit, a dollar, that allows the consumption of exactly με units of the natural resource and (1 − μ) ε units of the other goods, where 0 ≤ μ ≤ 1 and ε ≪ c (0), f (0). Accordingly, we define the discount factor at time t as the number of dollars needed at present to compensate for a lack of one dollar at time t. This implies that the discount rate, δ (t), is given by (Supplementary Note 1)where subscripts in this equation denote partial derivatives and the discount factor is given by exp(−Δ). The right side of Eq. 5, without the term ρ, is due to the change in the marginal contribution of c and f to social welfare. (Note that, if μ = 0 and d c / d t = cg c, then Eq. 5 becomes the Ramsey's discount formula, δ (t) = ηg c + ρ, where η ≡ cu c / u cc.) In turn, if μ reflects the portion in society's basket of goods allocated to consumption of the natural resource, then our definition is consistent with the way the marginal productivity of capital is measured, and the total product (e.g. GDP) is proportional to the total value of all the goods (Supplementary Note 1, Eq. A11). Alternatively, if we are interested in discounting some climate damage, then we can chose μ to be proportional to the cost that is due to the damage to the natural resource. Note, however, that the choice of μ only determines the units and does not affect the value given to future goods. Specifically, if the proportion of damages to the natural resource differs from μ, then one should consider the changes in relative prices in addition to discounting. For example, several authorsconsidered a dual discounting framework in which the natural resource is discounted with μ = 0 and the manufactured goods with μ = 1, where the change in the relative price accounts for the difference; this approach is equivalent to the one presented here.

### Own-price and cross-price elasticities of demand for cigarettes and waterpipe tobacco in three Eastern mediterranean countries: a volumetric choice experiment [^114smouw]. Tobacco Control (2023). Medium credibility.

One key strength of this study was the use of choice experiments, and volumetric choice experiments in particular, which represent a robust methodology for providing premarket testing evidence for recommending fiscal policies. The tobacco industry itself has publicly asserted choice experiments as the standard for simultaneous evaluation of the effectives of tobacco product attributes on consumer choice. Choice experiments offer potentially powerful premarket testing evidence for recommending public health regulatory strategies. Whereas choice experiments are increasingly being applied to tobacco control research, to our knowledge, this is the first study to use volumetric choice experiments in tobacco control.

Despite the robustness of results in this study, several limitations are worth noting. Although choice experiments estimate choice behaviour, they may be an imperfect predictor of behaviour, especially when there are barriers to the behaviour. For example, cravings are common among users of all nicotine-containing tobacco products and social drivers for smoking can offer strong cues to influence the demand for smoking, especially in the case of waterpipe smoking, which is often consumed in social settings. Nevertheless, behavioural intention has repeatedly been shown to be a significant predictor of future behaviour. The estimated elasticities are average elasticities and hold for average prices. It is possible that much higher taxes, producing large increases in prices would produce larger effects on quantities than those predicted in this study. In other words, it is possible that the greater the increase in prices, the higher the price elasticity (in absolute values) and, thus, the larger the effect on quantities. However, we are unable to extrapolate exactly how elasticities would change when prices change outside of the ranges observed in this study.

### Modeling interconnected minerals markets with multicommodity supply curves: examining the copper-cobalt-nickel system [^1115yXGC]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Many modeling approaches rely on aggregated representations of mineral supply and demand –. While some of these frameworks account for by-product behavior, they fail to capture the effects of changes at individual facilities, which is particularly important for many of the minor metals with relatively few producers. Consequently, mine-level representations may be more effective. While beyond the scope of this work, firm-level multi-commodity production optimization methods exist. However, they rely on a variety of complex cost allocation methods, where method selection can substantively impact results. Additional joint production models exist, but focus on production and recovery requirements to meet demand, neglecting mine economics.

Single-commodity mine-level modeling approaches often use supply curve-based methods, where relative production costs combine with demand to set price as the cost of the highest-cost producer –. Such methods are primarily used for commodities comprising the majority of mine revenues and has seen only limited extension to by-products. By-product supply curves have been proposed and used. but tend to function independent of host commodity economics or require allocating costs to the by-product commodity, a variable and uncertain process. One previous effort sought to use independent supply curves for copper, cobalt, and nickel production. There, host commodity mine decision-making occurred independent of the by-product market and relied on revenue-based cost allocation to estimate prices. However, revenue fractions are based on the relative prices of the commodities, producing circular logic. Similarly, host, by-product, and co-product status are functions of the relative prices of the jointly produced commodities, where sufficiently large price changes could alter the commodity used for mine decision-making. The methods described often overlook inter-commodity interactions and feedback, limiting their effectiveness in understanding market dynamics for jointly produced commodities.

### Over-exploitation of natural resources is followed by inevitable declines in economic growth and discount rate [^115gny2u]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

In turn, in the competitive market solution (see Methods), the rate of non-sustainable harvest is higher than the socially optimal rate, namely, the solution exhibits over-harvesting (Fig. 2c, d). Specifically, the harvest is still primarily sustainable in the managed regions but is non-sustainable in the shared regions. The total area under (non-sustainable) harvest in the shared regions increases over time, and consequently, f (t) continues to increase over an extended period of time, which postpones the decline in the discount rate. Eventually, however, at time t = t 1 (Fig. 2), the shared regions become entirely degraded and the total rate of non-sustainable harvest declines. In turn, the period during which managers over-harvest (t < t 1) is followed by declines in the discount rate, the cumulative discount (Δ), total production (Eq. A11), and the price of manufactured goods (Eq. A10). These declines are greater if the magnitude and/or duration of the over-harvesting are greater (e.g. if more regions are shared), and also if the natural and the manufactured goods are non-substitutable. Note that the optimal solution exhibits no declines in economic growth or in Δ because the social planner plans for the forthcoming constraints on the harvest by avoiding over-harvesting in the early stages (t < t 0); in the market solution, managers also take into account the forthcoming decline in f and avoid non-sustainable harvesting in the managed regions prior to time t = t 1, but they still over-harvest in the shared regions. Also note that, in both the optimal and the market solutions, the harvest functions, as well as c (t) and f (t), do not depend on μ (only the discount and the prices do).

### The importance of food systems and the environment for nutrition [^117MpP3K]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2021). Medium credibility.

A growing area of research is how climate change may affect food purchasing behaviors and whether environmental sustainability is a motivation for behavior change among food systems stakeholders, including consumers. For stakeholders involved in food production and supply chains, how might economic incentives or other measures increase the adoption of practices that benefit human health while stewarding ecological resources? For consumers, how might environmentally motivated behaviors differ between various age groups, socioeconomic classes, and in different country contexts? Are the synergies with health sufficient for environmental sustainability to be a motivator for consumers when making dietary choices? Whose ability to purchase nutritious foods is more resilient to the impacts of climate change, and for those who are disadvantaged, how can we ensure they are not left behind? We need to better understand the extent to which people in different contexts are aware of the environmental impact of the food they buy, and how this awareness may affect food choices — does it bolster or hinder the healthiness of food choices? Finally, we need more research on policies and interventions that incentivize healthy and sustainable diets — both from the standpoint of consumer choice and from the standpoint of agricultural and food supply chain practices.

Proximal outcomes of the food system

Diet

Shifting dietary intake at the population level is a formidable challenge, regardless of whether it is motivated by health, environmental, or other reasons. In the United States, for example, diets do not align with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, as illustrated by the nationwide average Healthy Eating Index-2015 score of 56.6 out of 100. Human dietary behavior is complex, and the extent to which it is driven by social norms related to environmental impact compared with health or other motivations is uncertain and an important topic for further research. One environmental motivation for dietary change is related to a question of resource use: even if the food system can produce adequate calories for a growing global population, can food production systems keep up with the demand for more resource-intensive foods? Rising incomes worldwide may increase the demand for animal source foods by 70%, which tend to have the highest environmental impact depending on where and how food is grown and raised.

### An economic demand-based framework for prioritization strategies in response to transient amino acid limitations [^117SDg44]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Living organisms in Miller's "Living Systems" have been compared to factories, with cells described as open systems, dealing with multiple inputs and outputs of matter, energy and information. In this context, how much can prioritizations of resource restorations be understood based on demand-dependent criteria (or in other words, when would demand dominate)? For cells, a main resource constraint is the input price, which is governed by precursor availability, and rules of chemistry, thermodynamics and evolutionary history. For amino acids, the individual supply prices are fairly constant. Therefore, demand-based criteria would dominate in cells when concentrations of metabolites are saturating (above the enzyme k m values), and this is typically the case for amino acids, resulting in a demand-elasticity of zero –. In contrasting contexts, where metabolite consumptions are regulated as a function of available supply, supply-based criteria will become increasingly important. Additionally, in a demand-driven context cells must manage the total supply costs because if an input cost is high, the supply is limited since there are boundaries to how much energy can be obtained within cells. An inference from this is that cells would optimize their outputs in tune with these energetic constraints. From classical economics, other factors that determine supply prices are: (i) processes used for supply, (ii) anticipation of future prices, (iii) the number of suppliers, and (iv) the presence of monopolies or cartels that restrict supply or increase perceived value of goods. In cells the first (enzymes, transporters) are optimized by selection, evidence for the second is limited to systems exhibiting hysteresis or oscillatory behavior, the third is finite and quantifiable, and the fourth rarely exists. Cells do not consider 'Veblen goods', which have artificially high prices because of perceptions (eg. as status symbols) that manufacture demand. These considerations could therefore help identify resource bottlenecks, as well as likely responses to disruptions in specific resources, and distinguish supply-driven vs demand-driven economies. Work in these areas holds promise to advance a broader understanding of resource allocation strategies in cells, and to improve the metabolic engineering of cell factories.

### Is the price right? Paying for value today to get more value tomorrow [^115wpWcc]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Secondly, we advocate for a comprehensive evaluation of the value of medicines from a societal perspective as the basis to gauge whether they are worth their cost to society. This evaluation should not be confined to immediate clinical benefits but should be extended to encompass the broad spectrum of advantages conferred by medical interventions in the near and long term to different stakeholders in our society. It is also imperative to incorporate pricing dynamics from competition (both for branded and generic medicines) in this assessment. By adopting this holistic societal approach, the perceived high costs of medicines can be understood and judged in terms of their contributions to the entire economy over the long term, thereby challenging the notion that drug prices are inherently exorbitant. However, for this view to be convincing, we must consider how and why several of the arguments advanced to argue that drugs are overpriced are flawed. For example, arguing that a drug is overpriced if it generates more in profit than it costs to develop ignores the need for a return on investment for an entire portfolio of projects from which few successes emerge. Arguing that drugs are overpriced because patients cannot afford them ignores the important role of insurance plan design in determining drug affordability and access. Also, arguing that drugs are overpriced in the USA because they are cheaper elsewhere fails to consider that other countries are possibly paying too little to support global R&D and are essentially freeriding off the USA's greater ability and willingness to support biomedical innovation.

While it remains appropriate to condemn specific instances of excessive economic "rent-seeking" or even price gouging when companies exploit regulatory or payment system loopholes to keep competitors away, it is wrong to imply that this happens with all medicines. Market flaws are not the same as the whole market being broken: flaws can be fixed without dismantling the whole market.

It is also both naive and harmful to population health to simply point to calculations by HTA bodies and health economists that claim to demonstrate that specific drugs are not cost-effective, without first scrutinizing the underlying methodology to see if it truly reflects all of society's values. We ask readers to consider how some first principles of value assessments might lead to a broader support for medical innovation.

### Carbon pricing drives critical transition to green growth [^111UK1XN]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

The energy producer will use power plants in order of least marginal costs, meaning it will always first use its full stock of green technologies. Let ϒ be the set of power plants required to meet demand. For, the energy producer will have a positive cost of production, given as (taken from equation 12 from Lamperti et al.):withbeing the number of produced energy units of the power plant. The energy producer asks for a fixed markup rate μ E ≥ 0 on top of its cost price. This cost price is determined as the average marginal production cost of dirty plantsmultiplied by the fraction of dirty energy in the last period. This gives the following energy price (equation 13 from Lamperti et al.):Energy producers do not use labor to produce, and their only production constrained is thus the stock of power plants. The producer can replace plants or expand the production capacity through investment. In order to avoid unrealistic energy shortages, it is assumed these investments can be realized instantly. The maximum production capacity is defined as (equation 15 from Lamperti et al.):Using this maximum capacity, the producer can decide to expand its plant stock based on the gap between the actual capital stock and the desired amount of capital. If the maximum capacity does not match the demand (i.e.), the planned expansionary investment will be. In order to choose which technology to buy (more of), producers decide whether the implementation cost of green technologies (for current best vintage v) is less than the estimated cost of operation of dirty technologies (as dirty technologies are assumed to have zero cost of implementation). Hence, if, the complete additional stock of power plants will be green, where b E is the discount factor. Here, the comparison is made between the cheapest green and dirty technologies. If the green technology is chosen, the cost of expansion is given as, andif the dirty technology is chosen.

### Design considerations for legalizing cannabis: lessons inspired by analysis of California's proposition 19 [^115ziHL8]. Addiction (2012). Low credibility.

Aims

No modern jurisdiction has ever legalized commercial production, distribution and possession of cannabis for recreational purposes. This paper presents insights about the effect of legalization on production costs and consumption and highlights important design choices.

Methods

Insights were uncovered through our analysis of recent legalization proposals in California. The effect on the cost of producing cannabis is largely based on existing estimates of current wholesale prices, current costs of producing cannabis and other legal agricultural goods, and the type(s) of production that will be permitted. The effect on consumption is based on production costs, regulatory regime, tax rate, price elasticity of demand, shape of the demand curve and non-price effects (e.g. change in stigma).

Results

Removing prohibitions on producing and distributing cannabis will dramatically reduce wholesale prices. The effect on consumption and tax revenues will depend on many design choices, including: the tax level, whether there is an incentive for a continued black market, whether to tax and/or regulate cannabinoid levels, whether there are allowances for home cultivation, whether advertising is restricted, and how the regulatory system is designed and adjusted.

Conclusions

The legal production costs of cannabis will be dramatically below current wholesale prices, enough so that taxes and regulation will be insufficient to raise retail price to prohibition levels. We expect legalization will increase consumption substantially, but the size of the increase is uncertain since it depends on design choices and the unknown shape of the cannabis demand curve.

Their economic behavior, influenced by diverse income sources such as labor, investments, and social benefits, shapes their consumption, savings decisions, and overall liquid wealth (W i, t). Actively engaging in both labor and goods markets, households make strategic consumption choices based on price and availability and adjust market relationships in response to demand fulfillment. This adaptive behavior not only reflects their individual economic circumstances but also contributes to the broader market dynamics, affecting the supply-demand equilibrium in the consumer goods and labor markets. At each time step t, households make decisions: (1) the amount of goods to consume and their suppliers, (2) their employer. The consumption amount depends on their wealth level W i, t, interpreting W i, t as liquid wealth excluding assets like real estate (as in). The wealth level adjusts through various income sources, with labor incomedefined as:where w i, t is the wage for L i labor units provided, and U B t are unemployment benefits. Total wealth for consumption at t is, where L A i, t is the liquid asset level. Households choose goods based on price and availability, adjusting market relationships in response to demand fulfillment. In case of unmet demand, they buy from other producers until no supply remains, avoiding high involuntary savings due to market mismatches. After transactions, they know their true consumption leveland liquid assets L A i, t +1 for the next period. Households may break trade connections with unsatisfactory suppliers (probability ψ Q) or seek lower prices (probability ψ P), applying pressure on producers to meet demand and reduce prices. Again, they are only bounded rational. In our case, this means, instead of analytically solving their explicit inter-temporal choice problem, they approximate it by comparing a finite set of actions (i.e. they lack the ability to compute perfect optima). These households have consumption and investment preferences, based on their wealth levels and heterogeneous time preferences. Each household i inter-temporal optimization problem is defined as:where α i is the absolute propensity to consume, as a portion of wealth level W i, t.is the household's discount factor with j − t as index for current and future time steps, and U (⋅) is the utility function, given as. This optimization problem is constrained by:Here, Y i, t is the household's income level at time t, which can come from labor, capital, or government subsidies. C i, t is the consumption level and r t the real interest rate. In order to solve the optimization problem in equation (2), households form expectations of their future income- and wealth level and the interest rate. These expectations are formed using simple adaptive updating rules:whereis the expected value and ω is a weighting factor. Based on the optimization problem, heterogeneous time preferences, and adjusting changing expectations, households have heterogeneous saving rates on both the cross-sectional and inter-temporal levels. Furthermore, these savings are precautionary, meaning that savings are motivated by the desire to keep a stable consumption level in case of a negative income shock. As a result, aggregate behavior qualitatively matches empirical data for the marginal propensity to consume, as shown in Fig. S7.

The sectors phosphate, water (W), renewable energy (other than biofuels) (R) and the other inputs (M A, M F, M P, M T, and M Y) are similarly represented by a production or extraction cost and the profit-maximization problem of the producers are given by

We have now described the maximization problems underlying decisions made by all producers. The representative household also solves a maximization problem, maximizing the utility derived from consumption. The households' preferences are represented by utility function U and the utility-maximization problem, subject to the income being I, is given by

This specification has divided consumption into two levels. While this division is not necessary at this level of generality, it clarifies the assumed substitutabilities between goods. We assume greater substitutability within than between categories. The upper level consists of food and non-food goods, with the former category consisting of food from agriculture and from fisheries, and the latter of manufactured goods, natural land and timber. The inclusion of natural land is intended to capture various ways in which households' demand for natural lands lead to land being kept from other uses, e.g. preservation of land as national parks. We assume that timber is consumed directly by the households.

This completes the description of the modeling of all decision-making agents in the model. In addition to conditions derived from these maximization problems, we must also specify market-clearing conditions that make sure that supplied and demanded quantities add up.

For land (L), the total supply is assumed to be fixed:

The remaining market-clearing conditions are for agricultural productionfossil fueland energy services

In summary, production functions, market-clearing conditions, budget constraints and first-order conditions from the maximization problems of representative agents provide us with 41 equilibrium conditions pinning down the 41 endogenous prices and quantities. The full set of equilibrium conditions are available in the Supplementary Methods.

### Modeling interconnected minerals markets with multicommodity supply curves: examining the copper-cobalt-nickel system [^113xzzVt]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

This work introduces a method for simultaneously modeling multiple jointly produced mineral commodities' prices, supply, and demand, considering multidirectional inter-commodity relationships. We compare this method with the previously most advanced method and find this method offers several advantages, including better reproduction of historical price and production for nearly all cases. It enables explicit representation of individual mines and their behaviors using a limited dataset: annual commodity production, cost per tonne of ore treated, and quantity of ore treated. Coupled with detailed multi-commodity data on potential deposits, this approach allows for forward-looking supply projections without needing to exogenously determine by-product or co-product status, or perform potentially problematic cost allocations, of jointly produced mineral commodities. The model can also assess various demand growth trajectories for different commodities while endogenously estimating their price structures and interactions. Understanding future mineral commodity prices can aide in evaluating the affordability of low-carbon energy and mobility technologies, their rates of adoption, and the mining operations necessary to fulfill the associated mineral demand.

Additionally, this method challenges the underlying assumptions of prior mineral supply models, namely that by-product and co-product commodities do not influence host commodity mine decision making. Not only does this method highlight substantial by-product / co-product effects on production and price for copper-cobalt and nickel-cobalt mines, but also for copper-nickel and nickel-copper mines. Game theory approaches have found that joint production enables implicit interactions even between single-commodity firms, such as copper and cobalt recyclers, due to their competition with multi-commodity firms, providing justification for these findings. Similarly, econometric studies of jointly-produced commodities' prices indicate host commodity price effects on by-product commodity prices have been overestimated, and that by-product price effects on host commodity prices have been underestimated. Furthermore, this method demonstrates that cobalt prices are more robust to host-commodity demand shifts when multidirectional relationships are considered, based on cobalt price response to copper and nickel demand shifters in the 2D and 4D cases. This result suggests this method better captures economy of scope, or the increased economic competitiveness for firms with more diversified outputs.

### Calculation of external climate costs for food highlights inadequate pricing of animal products [^115gM6h9]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Monetization

When putting the calculated emission values into monetary units with the emission cost rate from the German Federal Environment Agency (UBA) of 180 € per ton of CO 2 equivalents, their absolute external costs can be derived. The results are shown in Table 3 for conventional and organic farming in columns C b, conv and C b, n, conv as well as C b, org and C b, n, org, respectively. When these external costs are assessed in relation to their corresponding producer price (pp), the resulting percentage surcharge (∆) reflects the price increase necessary to internalize the GHG-related externalities arising from food production. Relative results for conventional and organic farming are shown in column ∆ b, conv and ∆ b, n, conv as well as ∆ b, org and ∆ b, n, org, respectively. Food-specific products (see Table 1) are omitted in this table since their respective monetary costs and percentage price increases follow the same pattern as the narrow category. Please refer to the "Method and data" section for details of the full calculation methodology and data origin.

Table 3
Producer prices (pp), external costs (C) and percentage price increases (∆) for narrow and broad food categories when externalities resulting from greenhouse gas emissions are monetized.

Producer prices are calculated by dividing the total amount of producer proceeds for each category (in Euro)with its total production quantity; external costs are derived by multiplying emission values from Table 1 with the emission cost rate of 180 €/tCO 2 eq; percentage price increases are the ratio of external costs to producer prices; in brackets are the values with land-use change (LUC) emission costs included.

In each broad and narrow category, the highest external costs and percentage surcharge are highlighted in red and the lowest in green. Source data are provided as a source data file.

### A method to estimate the economy-wide consequences of widespread, long duration electric power interruptions [^112DUpuy]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Virtually all economic activities depend on electric power, making individual and collective vulnerability to service disruptions a major concern. Although most interruptions originate at the distribution system-level and cause minimal disturbance to daily life, widespread and long-duration (WLD) interruptions (affecting entire utility service territories or larger regions, and lasting days, weeks, or longer) can have large social and economic impacts. Estimating the benefits to ratepayers and society of reducing economic losses associated with power interruptions — especially WLDs — is essential to regulatory and utility planning for power system reliability and resilience.

Power interruptions' economic losses emanate from two sources. The first, market equilibrium impacts, arise from curtailment of electricity supply, and hence consumption, below the level demanded in the economy's baseline state. Under conditions of normal market functioning, firms and households respond by substituting other inputs for electricity, which in turn stimulates price and quantity adjustments across the economy. Such responses generally increase electricity-using firms' production costs and the prices of their commodities, reduce factor hiring and remuneration to households, and, as consumers simultaneously face rising prices and declining incomes, reduce households' real consumption and well-being.

The second, disequilibrium impacts, arise when power disruptions trigger breakdowns in the normal functioning of markets by disrupting utility services, transportation links, and movements of goods and people. The short-run economic equilibrium consequences are that commodity demands exceed supplies (including inventories), and prices neither reflect true scarcity nor incentivize producers to increase supply to alleviate shortages. Firms and households take actions — uncoordinated by price signals — to preserve their profits and well-being, respectively (e.g. the use of backup generators). Such resilience tactics, although privately beneficial (indeed, they may be vital for survival), incur additional costs that fall directly on the customers themselves and affect prices in unanticipated ways. In such settings, the price and quantity adjustments necessary to restore the economy to its baseline state are likely to diverge from those manifesting in market equilibrium.

Circulation (2014). Medium credibility.

Key economic concepts — scarcity, opportunity cost, and efficiency are defined to frame value assessment. Scarcity is foundational: "the most fundamental of which is the concept of scarcity", requiring that "choices, or more precisely trade-offs, must be made", and leading to the notion of cost as "opportunity cost". "The opportunity cost of medical care is whatever else we might desire that cannot be produced because of the decision to produce more health care". Efficiency is highlighted as "A second critical economic concept", with the policy objective to "maximize the well-being (sometimes referred to as utility) of the members of society collectively", and with "Cost-benefit and cost-effectiveness analysis" presented as tools that quantify efficiency of policy choices.

### Medicines with one seller and many buyers: strategies to increase the power of the payer [^114KGBgc]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Some countries are increasingly interested in developing tiered or differential pricing, whereby different prices are charged to buyers according to their income levels. In theory, it offers the possibility of simultaneously increasing profits and expanding access to a medicine for a larger population. Several criticisms have been raised about tiered pricing, particularly the potentially arbitrary nature of determining tiers, whether it will improve access in lower income countries or small markets, and the lack of transparency or public input into pricing primarily set by sellers — a phenomenon known as price discrimination.

An alternative case has been made for expensive medicines offsetting longer term costs, leading to the development of value based pricing. Value based pricing follows the principle that price should reflect the value to the buyer rather than the actual costs of production plus a margin. It has emerged as a way of agreeing what will be considered during negotiations. Two stages are common: firstly, an agreement of what is included in the value assessment and secondly, how it is valued. Definitions of value can vary across stakeholders and contexts, however, with some arguing that the design of such models can be manipulated to demonstrate a desired outcome. Some countries have experimented with permitting several prices for a single medicine with multiple indications according to the value of each indication. Others, such as Germany, account for such potential differences in value across indications by setting its price according to an average weighted by the population treated in each indication. This strategy, however, may disincentivise applications for new indications with minimal added benefit over comparators, instead relying on off-label prescribing or reformulation of medicines.

Pooled procurement, or joint purchasing, can reduce the power of a monopoly. This allows several buyers to agree to purchase certain medicines exclusively through the group. Joint purchasing increases buyers' power because it provides access to several markets and increases the volume of product included in the tender. Pooled procurement has been shown to reduce the price of medicines drastically and improve access globally and regionally as suppliers and buyers both benefit from economies of scale. For example, the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States Pharmaceutical Procurement Service negotiated an average cost savings of 37% for 25 selected pharmaceuticals over a five year period (1998–2002). Pooled procurement is not a perfect solution, however, as constraints owing to differences in national process or legislation may need to be resolved before implementation and may exceed the expected savingsor lead to unintended consequences for the supply.

Key economic concepts — scarcity and opportunity cost emphasize that the most fundamental concept is scarcity, that "societies do not have enough resources to satisfy all of their citizens' wants and needs", and therefore "trade-offs, must be made". This need for trade-offs underlies opportunity cost, the idea of cost as "that which must be sacrificed to obtain something else", and in medical care it is "whatever else we might desire that cannot be produced because of the decision to produce more health care", with the reminder that "deferring trade-offs does not eliminate the need to make them".

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Table 2. Reference case for high-quality CEAs — costs and outcomes — states that costs should be based in the same jurisdiction as the target population, and health care cost estimates should reflect actual amounts paid, including out-of-pocket costs. Micro-costing can produce reliable cost estimates but is not always feasible; when micro-costing is not available or feasible, gross-costing is an acceptable alternative. Cost of drugs should reflect price after discounts or rebates in the base-case analysis, preferably the price available to the entity or majority of the treatment-eligible population. Costs of medical devices should be the price net of discounts when available or the list price when the net price is not available, and a wide range of costs should be examined in sensitivity analyses. Cost estimates should be adjusted for nonadherence, and the currency and year of evaluation should be clearly identified. For health outcomes, the reference case should report outcomes in terms of life years and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained, report alternative metrics when available, report intermediate outcomes, and may include disutility related to taking the treatment in sensitivity analyses.

### A TLR7 / 8 agonist increases efficacy of anti-fentanyl vaccines in rodent and porcine models [^116Z8ZgA]. NPJ Vaccines (2023). Medium credibility.

Behavioral economic demand curve analysis

To directly measure the effects of vaccination on the reinforcing efficacy of fentanyl, exponential demand curve analysis was performed on fentanyl intake during FSA unit dose-response determinations as previously described. Briefly, an exponential demand equation, log Q = log Q 0 + k (e -α* Q 0* C –1), was used to describe the relationship between fentanyl consumption and unit price (FR/unit dose). The dependent variable, Q, is the quantity consumed. The independent variable, C, is the cost of fentanyl in terms of the unit price. The free parameters, Q 0 and α, are estimated from the best-fit function and refer to the maximum level of consumption at zero price (i.e. level or 'intensity" of demand) and the rate of change in consumption with increases in unit price, respectively. The range of the exponential function, k, is a constant specifying the range of consumption in log units. The k value is held constant across data sets being compared (set to 3.63 in the present study) because changes in k impact the value of α. The value of α is inversely related to reinforcing efficacy so drugs that produce rapidly declining (elastic) demand curves have higher α values and lower reinforcing efficacy than demand curves with slower declining (inelastic) demand curves. In the present context, vaccines that increase α values for fentanyl consumption would be those that increase the sensitivity of FSA to price (increase elasticity of demand), suggesting that vaccination reduces the reinforcing efficacy or motivational strength of fentanyl. Additional indices of demand were measured, including P max, the price at which consumption changes from relatively inelastic to relatively elastic, and O max, the maximum level of response output (i.e. active lever responding). Demand curve analysis was conducted using the exponential demand function for nonlinear regression in GraphPad Prism 9 software (GraphPad Software, Inc. La Jolla, CA). Because zero is not defined on a log scale, data from the 0 µg/kg unit dose (saline) were not included in the analysis. The P max and O max parameters were derived from Q 0, α, and k using the spreadsheet application provided by Kaplan and Reed.

### Pharmaceutical price controls and patient welfare [^117FqXYy]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Price controls could have a substantial negative effect on pharmaceutical research and development. Extensive research is required before the development costs of a new drug or its benefits are known; most new drug development projects fail, sometimes after substantial financial and time costs. These conditions pose intractable practical problems for the operation of price controls, which cannot rest on objective, predictable standards such as the benefits or costs of individual drugs. In the absence of objective standards, pressure from health care providers and others would create powerful incentives for price regulators to decrease drug prices toward marginal costs of production and distribution, well below levels sufficient to reward innovative research. This downwardly biased price-setting mechanism would apply with particular force to the few successful projects that yield innovative drugs, whose prices would not be set by regulatory authorities until after research expenditures have been incurred and the new drugs are ready to enter the market. Manufacturers will expect price controls to reduce the potential payoffs from breakthrough drugs. This expectation would substantially reduce the incentives to pursue innovative research, as is evident in advanced economies in which price controls are now in force. Once established, price controls for pharmaceuticals, like those for medical services in the Medicare system, would also tend toward complexity and entrenchment of vested interests and could easily become permanent regardless of the harm they cause to patients.

### Price elasticity of cigarette smoking in Bangladesh: evidence from the global adult tobacco surveys (GATS) [^113e2qSw]. Tobacco Control (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Bangladesh has one of the largest tobacco-using populations (37.8 million adults; prevalence 35.3%) in the world. The cigarette smoking prevalence among adults in Bangladesh has remained steady at around 14% over the last decade. Among males, the prevalence was 28.3% in 2009 and 28.7% in 2017, while among females, it was stagnant at around 0.2% in 2009 and 2017. Cigarette prevalence also varied considerably across income groups, educational attainment and location. It is highest among men with no formal education (35.6%), belonging to the lowest wealth quintile (30.7%) and living in urban areas (31.5%).

Taxation is an important price instrument for regulating the consumption of tobacco products. While increasing the price of tobacco products through taxation helps to reduce tobacco use, the magnitude of the response is not uniform. The effectiveness of a tax increase depends on both the increase in price resulting from the tax change and the price elasticity of demand (ie, the responsiveness of quantity demanded to a change in price), among other factors. The total price elasticity of cigarettes can be further divided into prevalence and intensity elasticity. Prevalence elasticity measures the proportionate change in the decision to smoke cigarettes due to the percentage change in price, while intensity elasticity measures the percentage change in the number of sticks a smoker smokes when the price changes.

### Estimating and comparing the effects of price-and potency-based taxes on cannabis purchase patterns in an experimental cannabis marketplace [^116HVkdM]. Addiction (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Recreational cannabis legalization has made high-potency cannabis products more readily available, raising public health concerns. While price-based taxes are common, potency-based taxes have been adopted as a potentially more effective approach to mitigate the harms associated with high-potency cannabis consumption. This study aimed to estimate and compare the effects of price- and potency-based taxes on cannabis purchase patterns.

Design

In May 2024, we conducted an online Experimental Cannabis Marketplace experiment, where cannabis products varied in product categories, delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) levels, and prices. Participants completed hypothetical purchase sessions with varying tax rates and tax types. Potency-based taxes were designed to be higher for high-THC products and lower for low-THC products than price-based taxes. The Poisson random effects model was used to estimate the association between tax rates and each outcome for the two tax types. The Wald tests assessed differences in coefficients between the two tax types.

Setting

U.S. states with recreational cannabis legalization.

Participants

A total of 1250 adult cannabis users.

Measurements

Cannabis purchase patterns, including quantity demanded, THC demanded, and expenses.

Findings

For both price- and potency-based taxes, a higher tax rate was associated with a lower quantity demanded (total, by product category, and by THC level), lower total THC demanded, increased total expenses, and increased tax expenses (all ps < 0.01). The price elasticity of quantity demanded was estimated to be -0.46 and the price elasticity of THC demanded was estimated to be -0.48 to -0.52. Compared with price-based taxes, potency-based taxes were associated with a lower quantity demanded for high-THC products (elasticity for potency-based taxes = -0.59 and for price-based taxes = -0.49; p for elasticity difference = 0.046) and a lower proportion of total expenses on high-THC products (elasticity for potency-based taxes = -0.11 and for price-based taxes = -0.05; p for elasticity difference = 0.028). No differences were observed between the two tax types in quantity demanded for all products, total THC demanded, or total expenses.

Conclusions

Potency-based taxes on cannabis products appear to be more effective at reducing demand for high-potency products compared with price-based taxes.

### Over-exploitation of natural resources is followed by inevitable declines in economic growth and discount rate [^1157oLgz]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Fig. 2
Over-harvesting extends the period during which the discount rate is high, but it is followed by sharp declines in the discount rate and the cumulative discount. Panels a and b demonstrate the optimal harvest of the natural resource from a social planner's perspective, where the natural resource and the other goods are either non-substitutable (a, Eq. B2) or partially substitutable (b, Eq. B10). In the early stages, harvesting activity increases exponentially and the discount rate is high. Approximately at time t 0, when harvesting is occurring in the whole system (H s + H n = x 1 + x 2), the total harvest stops increasing and the discount rate decreases. Next, panels c and d demonstrate harvesting in a competitive market in which some of the regions are shared. The parameters and utility functions used in panels c and d are identical to those used in panels a and b, respectively. The period during which the discount rate is high is extended until t = t 1 due to over-harvesting of the natural resource in the shared regions (compare panel a with panel c, and compare panel b with panel d). However, this period is followed by a rebound in which harvesting declines and the discount rate and the cumulative discount drop. In addition, around t = t 1, the price of the natural resource increases and the total product decreases. Note that, in accordance with the theorem, the cumulative discount approaches lower values if the harvest is determined by the market. Scaling: the harvest rates are given in (years) −1, the total non-degraded areas are given in units showing the maximal annual sustainable yield (ax 1 and ax 2), and Δ is given by 100 times the value on the y -axis. The parameter values used are within their realistic ranges (Methods). Parameter values and Source data are provided as a Source Data file

### Unequal exchange of labour in the world economy [^1131b3v4]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Scholars of international political economy have argued that growth and capital accumulation in the wealthy 'core' states of the global North relies on the appropriation of value — labour, resources and goods — from the 'peripheries' and 'semi-peripheries' of the global South –. In the contemporary world economy, this appropriation occurs in large part through what scholars have defined as 'unequal exchange' in international trade –. Literature in this field has described how core states and firms leverage their geopolitical and commercial power to compress wages, prices and profits in the global South, both at the level of national economies as well as within global commodity chains (which account for more than 70% of trade), such that Southern prices are systematically lower relative to Northern prices. Price inequalities compel Southern states and producers to export more labour and resources embodied in traded goods to the global North each year in order to pay for any given level of imports, enabling Northern economies to net-appropriate value to the benefit of Northern capital and consumers.

Dynamics of unequal exchange are understood to have intensified in the 1980s and 1990s with the imposition of structural adjustment programmes (SAPs) across the global South. SAPs devalued Southern currencies, cut public employment and removed labour and environmental protections, imposing downward pressure on wages and prices. They also curtailed industrial policy and state-led investment in technological development and compelled Southern governments to prioritise 'export-oriented' production in highly competitive sectors and in subordinate positions within global commodity chains. At the same time, lead firms in the core states have shifted industrial production to the global South to take direct advantage of cheaper wages and production costs, while leveraging their dominance within global commodity chains to squeeze the wages and profits of Southern producers. These interventions have further increased the North's relative purchasing power over Southern labour and goods.

### Modeling interconnected minerals markets with multicommodity supply curves: examining the copper-cobalt-nickel system [^112K3b9Q]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Demand for many of the metals used in the energy transition is expected to grow rapidly. Many of these are by-products, often considered critical because their production responds weakly to prices and is instead tied to the economics of the host mineral. We present a model of prices and production for jointly produced commodities that accounts for interconnectivity between host and by-product markets at the mine level. We demonstrate this method using the copper-cobalt-nickel system, in which approximately 99% of cobalt is a by-product of copper or nickel mining. Our results show that the model more accurately captures the economic benefits of diversified mine outputs than previous approaches. Furthermore, changes in demand drivers for any two commodities produce non-linear effects on production and price. We challenge the prior best-practice assumption that cobalt cannot impact the copper or nickel markets. Recognizing the importance of both copper and cobalt for future electrification, we emphasize that incentivizing the copper industry to reduce cobalt supply risks could inadvertently undermine copper supply.

### Availability of cost-effectiveness studies for drugs with high Medicare part D expenditures [^111CHnJU]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Before the COVID-19 pandemic, analysts forecasted that the US would spend $350 billionon prescription drugs in 2020 (nearly 10% of US health care spending), whereas the global pharmaceutical market would increase to $1.3 trillion worldwide. Although pandemic-related systemic shocks may alter these figures, there remains a consensus that the current situation is unsustainable and requires policy intervention. One potential intervention is a value-based drug formulary design, which seeks to price drugs based on their value for patients.

A value-based drug formulary design incorporates the cost-effectiveness of a drug when determining coverage or cost-sharing for the consumer. A cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) compares marginal benefits and marginal costs of treatment with the next-best alternative. Data from CEAs have formed the basis for health care reimbursement schemes in many developed countries other than the US; for example, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence has used CEAs to guide the National Health Service in the UK. In principle, data from CEAs can be used to promote access to high-value therapies, encourage additional development of high-value treatments, and provide information regarding reducing excess spending on low-value treatments.

In the US, Medicare Part D is the prescription drug program for more than 40 million Medicare beneficiaries. With more than $100 billion of annual expenditures, it is responsible for more than 30% of all prescription drug spending in the US. Although certain drugs, specifically those administered in physician offices or infusion centers, are paid for by Medicare Part B insurance, Medicare Part D spending composes 77% of total Medicare drug spending. A value-based drug formulary design depends on data from CEAs to guide decisions. However, few data exist regarding the extent to which the cost-effectiveness of the drugs responsible for the bulk of US pharmaceutical spending is studied. Therefore, we evaluated the availability and quality of published CEAs on the drugs for which Medicare Part D spending was the greatest in 2016.

### Is the price right? Paying for value today to get more value tomorrow [^1132YeTG]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Contemporary debates about drug pricing feature several widely held misconceptions, including the relationship between incentives and innovation, the proportion of total healthcare spending on pharmaceuticals, and whether the economic evaluation of a medicine can be influenced by things other than clinical efficacy.

Main Body

All citizens should have access to timely, equitable, and cost-effective care covered by public funds, private insurance, or a combination of both. Better managing the collective burden of diseases borne by today's and future generations depends in part on developing better technologies, including better medicines. As in any innovative industry, the expectation of adequate financial returns incentivizes innovators and their investors to develop new medicines. Estimating expected returns requires that they forecast revenues, based on the future price trajectory and volume of use over time. How market participants decide what price to set or accept can be complicated, and some observers and stakeholders want to confirm whether the net prices society pays for novel medicines, whether as a reward for past innovation or an incentive for future innovation, are commensurate with those medicines' incremental value. But we must also ask "value to whom?"; medicines not only bring immediate clinical benefits to patients treated today, but also can provide a broad spectrum of short- and long-term benefits to patients, their families, and society. Spending across all facets of healthcare has grown over the last 25 years, but both inpatient and outpatient spending has outpaced drug spending growth even as our drug armamentarium is constantly improving with safer and more effective medicines. In large part, this is because, unlike hospitals, drugs typically go generic, thus making room in our budgets for new and better ones, even as they often keep patients out of hospitals, driving further savings.

Conclusion

A thorough evaluation of drug spending and value can help to promote a better allocation of healthcare resources for both the healthy and the sick, both of whom must pay for healthcare. Taking a holistic approach to assessing drug value makes it clear that a branded drug's value to a patient is often only a small fraction of the drug's total value to society. Societal value merits consideration when determining whether and how to make a medicine affordable and accessible to patients: a drug that is worth its price to society should not be rendered inaccessible to ill patients by imposing high out-of-pocket costs or restricting coverage based on narrow health technology assessments (HTAs). Furthermore, recognizing the total societal cost of un- or undertreated conditions is crucial to gaining a thorough understanding of what guides the biomedical innovation ecosystem to create value for society. It would be unwise to discourage the development of new solutions without first appreciating the cost of leaving the problems unsolved.

### Tiered pricing of vaccines: a win-win-win situation, not a subsidy [^113wdSdP]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2005). Medium credibility.

It is a widespread misconception that tiered pricing of vaccines entails the producers or consumers in the high-price markets subsidising the consumers in the low-price markets. Such a view is inconsistent with realities, as well as with economic theory. In the vaccine sector, the cost and demand structures ensure that all three parties involved benefit. The developing countries' low-price market consumers get access to a product that would have been unattainable if the vaccines were offered at a uniform price. The producers benefit from increased revenues and profits, and the developed countries' high-price market consumers benefit from slightly lower prices than would be the case in the absence of the low-price market. This article rebuts the notion that tiered pricing of vaccines is a subsidy, and discusses past experiences, present challenges, and future opportunities for tiered pricing of vaccines in relation to developing countries' immunisation programmes.

### Demand for tobacco products in Bangladesh [^1126rRYc]. Tobacco Control (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Tobacco tax increase is considered as one of the most effective means to reduce tobacco consumption and its consequences. An increase in taxes, which results in an increase in the price of tobacco products, reduces consumption. Historically, a number of studies estimated the responsiveness of quantity demanded to a change in price-the price elasticity of demand-of tobacco products in Bangladesh. However, the government's stronger commitment to reducing tobacco use, rising standard of living, rapidly changing cultural norms due to globalisation, and the substantial fall in tobacco use seen in GATS 2017 necessitate an updated measure of price elasticity of tobacco use, which will allow for more accurate answers to questions of tobacco tax policy in the country. This study endeavours to fill this gap in the literature on demand for tobacco products in Bangladesh.

Objective

To estimate the price elasticity of demand for tobacco products, namely cigarettes, biris and smokeless tobacco (SLT) products with the 2016 household income and expenditure survey data in Bangladesh.

Methods

We used the Deaton model (1997) to estimate the price elasticities of demand for tobacco products using the Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES) 2016 dataset of the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics. The HIES 2016 surveyed 46076 households spread over 2304 primary sampling units across the country. We have calculated own price elasticities of demand for tobacco products by expenditure groups and by regions (rural and urban).

Results

The estimates of own-price elasticity of demand for cigarette, biri and SLT products are -1.03, -1.34 and -0.30, respectively. The results show that rural households are more responsive to changes in the prices of cigarettes than urban households. Households with low expenditure are found to be more responsive to changes in the price of cigarettes than the households with high expenditure. This suggests that increases in cigarette prices at the lower end would effectively reduce cigarette consumption among the people having low expenditure and improve health equity.

Conclusions

Our results suggest that the demand for smoking tobacco products is responsive to price changes. Therefore, substantial increase in the prices of tobacco products through taxation will result in significant reduction in tobacco use, particularly among the low expenditure households, while increasing government revenue.

### The case for OFSMOKE: how tobacco price regulation is needed to promote the health of markets, government revenue and the public [^1167WPYH]. Tobacco Control (2010). Low credibility.

Table 1
Cigarette market shares (%) by global brand owner for the major cigarette markets *, 2008

This highly concentrated nature of cigarette markets is exacerbated by the significant underlying barriers to market entry by new cigarette manufacturers which have inadvertently been amplified by tobacco control measures, notably bans on advertising and promotion. These measures are essential and effective components of tobacco control strategiesand are thus likely to expand in both scope and geographical reach. In addition, the product is highly addictive and there are no real alternatives, whether in the form of pharmaceutical nicotine or alternative tobacco products, currently available and able to compete with cigarettes.

This market failure gives cigarette companies immense pricing power which in turn is exacerbated by tobacco tax policies, the most effective tobacco control policy available. Taxes make up a large portion, and manufacturer's revenue a small portion, of the final price consumers pay. As a result, small increments in the manufacturer's margin have negligible impact on demand but equate to big increases in manufacturer revenue. This is particularly true in countries which have high specific tax levels. As normal competitive forces are absent, the resulting oligopoly can raise prices seemingly at will, generating sustained high profits, significantly higher than those earned on other consumer staples. As table 2 shows, the profitability of Europe's two largest tobacco companies (measured using the EBITA Margin — the firms' earnings before interest, taxation and amortisation expenses have been deducted as a proportion of its total revenue) is significantly greater than that of comparable consumer staple companies. Currently, tobacco profits are approximately double those of most other companies and these very high returns are predicted to continue into the future. Only one firm, Diageo, comes close to matching the high profitability of the tobacco companies; Diageo stands out as being abnormally profitable in the beverages industry sector and may also benefit from market power, reportedly enjoying 50% of the UK gin and 40% of the global vodka market.

### Medicines with one seller and many buyers: strategies to increase the power of the payer [^115U2gJc]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

The case for collaboration

Achieving fair pricing of medicines is particularly important for medicines that are only available from a single source (a monopoly). Price negotiations can deliver mixed results where negotiations are based on discounts from a "list price" ceiling set by the seller, rather than a negotiating floor that reflects the cost of production.

No single strategy or policy can lead to a fair price for medicines. Each policy has its benefits and drawbacks, and thus it is important that it is not used in isolation. For buyers a robust strategy would make use of elements of each policy and be adapted to country characteristics.

In the absence of transparent data, buyers need to maximise their market power (monopsony power) to rival the monopoly they are confronting, otherwise an imbalance in market forces can lead to market failure. By imposing some of the strategies outlined above, payers have asserted their buying power and come closer to achieving a fair price.

Buyers seeking fairer prices benefit from both transparency and collaboration, but this requires strong commitment from decision makers. International commitment is emerging, with a recent World Health Assembly resolution on improving the transparency of markets. Ultimately, a successful strategy to achieve fair pricing necessitates cooperation, both among buyers and among other stakeholders.

Key messages

Achieving fair pricing of medicines is particularly acute for single source medicines — that is, medicines lacking an alternative with a similar indication (monopoly)
Price negotiations deliver mixed results, particularly when anchored by discounts from a "list price" ceiling set by the seller, with no transparency about the true costs of development and production that could anchor a negotiating floor
In the absence of transparent data, the closest that buyers can get to fairer pricing is to impose regulations and policies that attempt to assert their buying power
Ultimately, a successful strategy to achieve fair pricing necessitates cooperation, both among buyers and among other stakeholders

### Accelerating progress on effective tobacco tax policies in Montenegro [^111EcfBa]. Tobacco Control (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The objective of this study is to estimate the sensitivity of cigarette quantity demanded to price and income changes in Montenegro.

Data and Methods

The sensitivity of cigarette quantity demanded to price and income changes was estimated using micro and macro analysis. Micro analysis implied the use of Deaton's model on Household Budget Survey data (2006–2017). In macro analysis, conventional static demand model is applied using error correction and autoregressive distributed lag time series methodology on annual time series aggregated data (2001–2017).

Results

The same results were obtained using micro and macro analysis which contributes to the objectivity of the conducted research. Results derived from the Deaton's model indicate a negative price elasticity of cigarettes in the range between -0.62 and -0.80 (conditional and unconditional), while in macro model estimated price elasticity is in that range and equals -0.68. Simulation results confirm the efficiency of excise tax policy changes, having an evident decrease in consumption and increase of public revenues.

Conclusion

Analysis of the tobacco market and regulatory environment suggests that the increase of excise and other taxes on tobacco have an important direct impact on the reduction of cigarettes and other tobacco products consumption. Our estimates of long and short-run price elasticity show that direct impact is strong and very much in accordance with the results obtained so far for other low-income and middle-income countries. This paper gives a contribution to the analysis of price elasticity of demand for cigarettes, which was for the first time conducted in Montenegro.

### Ethics in clinical research [^111ibJcy]. Journal of Hepatology (2009). Low credibility.

R&D of new drugs is driven by pharmaceutical companies that invest considerable amounts of money for this purpose. This may introduce bias, to emphasize the clinical value of drugs to be allowed onto the market. Bias is caused by methodological flaws including the population under study, the choice of inadequate comparators or of their dosage, the adoption of surrogate or composite endpoints, the decision to publish mainly positive findings or to overlook some safety concerns, etc. All this happens in a legal context that requires no added value for new drugs to be approved for the market. This encourages the use of placebo even when active comparators are available, or the search for non-inferiority of new products in comparison with active comparators. Superiority over placebo and non-inferiority to active comparators may allow drugs onto the market that are in fact less active (or safe, tolerable, convenient, etc.) than those already available, usually with consolidated properties and lower costs. In addition, they do not meet patients' or physicians' needs of defining the place in therapy and respective roles of new and available treatments. The current legislative and regulatory setting seems designed to meet commercial interests rather than public health needs.

### Recognizing that evidence is made, not born [^111ahdWX]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2019). Medium credibility.

Seppe's effects

If developed and operated well, SEPPE would bring the sciences of R&D, evaluation, and decision making closer to the realities of society today. It could provide a means to routinely and transparently align goals and incentives across stakeholder communities, improving health ecosystem connections and behaviors. Patients, prescribers, and payers would have dependable opportunities for their voices to be heard before it is too late in the development cycle, maximizing the chance of pulling products through development, which are really needed and of high value. Patient‐focused critical questions seeking answers about patient "responders" (i.e. those most likely to benefit, or benefit the most) and "reacters" (i.e. those most susceptible to harm, or to worst harms), could be tackled earlier, accelerating research. Patients' and researchers would be assured that participation in SEPPE clinical studies would be worth their time and effort.

SEPPE would catalyze and integrate scientific regulatory, HTA, and payer developments, streamlining the efforts of those stakeholders. Given SEPPE's distribution of resources and activities across planning, development, evaluation, and reimbursement processes, a log‐jam of evaluations downstream could be avoided. Industry could anticipate better development predictability, clearer understanding of social and technical needs for their products, higher probability of success, and reduced investment/development waste and costs. SEPPE could also reduce costs to the health system as a whole, because critical decisions by all stakeholders depend on the quality of the accumulating evidence: collateral damage and expenditures arising from nonvalue‐added activities in development, regulation, reimbursement, and/or use could be minimized.

SEPPE should also help leverage best use of real‐world data and evidence approaches and resources throughout product life‐span and avoid narrower, more negatively focused, down‐the‐line evidence recovery operations. SEPPE's documentation requirements regarding evidence attributes and hazards, building upon each SEPPE‐based product development cycle, could also provide a reference platform for generalizable and open‐source learnings to fast‐track R&D learning across the communities for continuous improvement and advancing efficiencies. Ultimately, SEPPE could help make more sense out of an increasingly complicated and shifting environment.

### Undermining government tax policies: common legal strategies employed by the tobacco industry in response to tobacco tax increases [^113j6AZd]. Preventive Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Similarly, Indonesia's complex tax system favoring smaller scale producers motivated tobacco companies to split operations into smaller scale facilities. Imposing comparable tax rates on substitutable tobacco products, regardless of their characteristics, prices or production process, can prevent this form of tax avoidance.
3 Lowering producer prices on some or all products in an ad valorem tax regime reduces tax payments. Even though lower prices reduce profit margins, the overall profit might not decline if lower prices increase sales. Reducing prices of selective brands may also help to retain price sensitive customers. This will minimize the impact of a tax increase on sales/consumption and lower tax revenue.

In 2012, Senegal increased tobacco tax from 40% to 45% and from 20% to 40% of retail price on premium and economy brands, respectively. In response, Philip Morris International reduced the price of Marlboro from US$1.20 to US$0.79 per pack to reclassify it from premium to economy, thereby completely avoiding the tax increase. Levying a uniform specific tax on all tobacco products/brands would prevent this type of tax avoidance.
4 Over-shifting a tax increase raises retail prices more than the tax increase. Higher profit margins compensate the industry for the reduction in sales due to higher tax while the government can be blamed for the entire price increase. Over-shifting can occur selectively, e.g. on higher priced brands, since the demand for them is usually less price-sensitive. Over-shifting at all price levels has a positive impact on public health since it suppresses demand, but results in less than predicted tax revenue. In South Africa, for example, inflation-adjusted tax increased by 377% from 1994 to 2010. During the industry's increased its net-of-tax price by 173%. This increased both tax revenue and the industry's profitability despite lower sales. This industry behavior indicates that the market can absorb higher prices, and therefore higher taxes.
5 Under-shifting tax increases is usually a temporary attempt to preserve sales as the industry absorbs a part of the tax increase, usually on low price brands, to retain price-sensitive consumers. This reduces the public health impact of tax increases due to a smaller than expected reduction in demand, but increases the tax revenue above the expectation due to larger than expected sales.

### A perspective on global access to insulin: a descriptive study of the market, trade flows and prices [^112AXbCu]. Diabetic Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Insulin manufacturers in addition to the 'big three' companies were identified in the present study, but their contribution to the global insulin market is small. The present study confirms that the countries with the largest exports are those in which the big three manufacturers are located 4, 5. The trade data also highlight how certain large countries import a large proportion of the global insulin produced, and some countries are dependent on just one source for their insulin supply. The data from Management Sciences for Health show that, for human insulin, the median price in the period 1996–2013 remained relatively stable. Overall, however, there were large variations in price among WHO regions and income groups. From comparing the data sources in the present study, it can be seen that increasing competition, with less reliance on a big three company and on a given import link, decreases prices. Number of import links and quantity of insulin ordered would seem to be moderately and inversely associated with price.

For medicines for which there are a large number of generic manufacturers, the average price for the generic product falls to 20% of the price of the branded product 24. For insulin barriers for biosimilar insulin manufacturers to enter markets include the full ownership of the production process, size of their local market and presence in other markets to generate revenue, overall manufacturing capacity and percentage of this capacity currently being utilized, regulatory hurdles in that biosimilar products face a more stringent regulatory assessment than that for small molecule generics, entry into markets, perception issues with regards to quality, and overall influence of the big three 25. The contribution of other manufacturers of insulin to domestic markets needs to be studied further, in particular those in India and China. The recent agreement between Sandoz (the Novartis generic arm) and Gan and Lee, the Chinese insulin manufacturer, may signal that Indian or Chinese manufacturers may become more influential globally 26. WHO pre‐qualification of insulin, the assessment of a producer by the WHO to ensure their capacity to produce a product of consistent quality in agreement with global standards, might enable an increase in reliable sources of quality‐assured insulin. A recent pilot study on pre‐qualification of biosimilars for cancer treatment is a positive step 27.

### Over-exploitation of natural resources is followed by inevitable declines in economic growth and discount rate [^111w8VwG]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

The exploitation of ecosystems by humans has long-lasting consequences for the future provision of natural resources and ecosystem services. This may negatively affect the provision of food, increase health hazards and risks of natural disasters, and more. Degraded ecosystems may be slow to recover or may not recover naturally even after their exploitation stops –. Consequently, the availability of natural resources such as food, clean air, and other ecosystem services, may be adversely impacted for extended periods if the ecosystems providing these resources become degraded. For example, the emission of greenhouse gases may affect the global climate for centuries; invasive species and diseases may irreversibly damage ecosystems; and the non-sustainable harvest of fisheries and forests may leave these systems degraded for decades, or even lead to their irreversible and permanent degradation. Since natural resources are limited, it has been widely recognized that a transition to sustainable harvest is necessary. What the optimal pathway and speed are for this transition, however, constitute the focus of an ongoing debate. For example, it has been suggested that an abrupt transition may slow economic growth in developing countries and may negatively affect production, and that rapid emission cuts may create energy deficits before we manage to develop viable substitutes.

Determining the optimal strategy for the adoption of sustainable management over time requires cost-benefit analyses. A common approach is to consider a social planner whose objective is to maximize social welfare –. This is often formalized as maximizing a net present value, where B (t) is the benefit minus the cost (in units of consumption) due to both the management and the environment at time t, and Δ(t) is the cumulative discount. In turn, the discount factor, exp(−Δ(t)), is the number of units of some good or currency needed at present to compensate for the lack of one unit at time t. The rationale behind discounting is that the objective of our society is to maximize welfare rather than net consumption. In turn, if society is going to be wealthier in the future, then one unit of consumed goods in the future may add less to welfare than the same unit today –.

### Recognizing that evidence is made, not born [^117AYU1W]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2019). Medium credibility.

What would seppe look like in practice?

The five global domains of activities that constitute the full cycle of development and assessment following molecule discovery would be retained, but SEPPE would change how each of these is approached, to minimize defects (Figure 1):

Figure 1
Structured Evidence Planning, Production and Evaluation Principles. The existing five main research and development (R&D) activity blocks would be approached with end‐to‐end, built‐in quality mindsets and explicit procedures: (1) understand stakeholder product needs; (2) understand stakeholder evidence needs; (3) plan the evidence; (4) produce the evidence; and (5) evaluate the totality of the evidence and product performance, and within applicable contexts. Collaborative approaches would be taken within and between each block, incorporating: early and iterating feedback‐loops and adjust loops; avoiding anticipatable problems and promptly rejecting problems if they do occur 90; optimizing and adapting stakeholders' decision‐making throughout planning, production, and evaluation.

understand stakeholders' product needs;
understand stakeholders' evidence needs;
plan the evidence generation;
produce the evidence;
evaluate the therapeutic product, at predefined time points, based on the evidence and contexts.

Existing best practices elements 12, 13, 69, 93 would be upheld and incorporated into the larger SEPPE framework and specific new approaches and concrete activities would be introduced. Within and between each of the domains would be iterating practices for collaborative stakeholder deliberations and choices, adapting and adding to structured methodologies for: (1) stakeholder engagement 94; (2) decision making using "benefit‐risk" and value frameworks 95; and (3) flexible/expediting regulatory/reimbursement approaches. 46, 47, 48, 50, 51 Modern, practical, and user‐friendly tools like fit‐for‐purpose software programs incorporating all these best practices in a highly granular way would guide developers and other participants in building optimal development plans. Software could be modeled after total quality‐based programs being implemented for food defense and safety. 97, 98 Other electronic tools using visual representations, such as heat maps, could be developed to permit readily discernible tracking of evidence development progress against stakeholders' needs. 99 Together, next generation electronic tools would enable continuous, transparent documentation of activities, decisions and outcomes, with monitoring throughout.

### Prescription drug prices: an AAN position statement [^115yYm5b]. Neurology (2024). High credibility.

AAN position — transparency in prescription drug pricing — supports proposals to promote transparency and to prohibit direct-to-consumer advertising, and highlights reporting frameworks in the CARES Act. The AAN supports proposals that promote transparency in prescription drug pricing and states that disclosure of pricing information, including how drugs are priced, the prices paid by insurers, and the prices paid by consumers, would provide information that could lower costs for patients and the healthcare system; the AAN also supports proposals that prohibit direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription drugs. The document notes that a provision in the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act creates additional manufacturing reporting requirements and that the CARES Act (sections 3112 and 3121) provides a framework for reporting volumes of drugs produced but would benefit from more specific language regarding developing cooperative mechanisms among manufacturers and regulators to share information regarding the increasingly complex drug supply chain in the United States.

### Over-exploitation of natural resources is followed by inevitable declines in economic growth and discount rate [^113txUVy]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Choice of parameters

The parameter values used for all of the numerical simulations, which are given in the Source Data file, are within their realistic ranges. The rate of technological growth is around 1.5–2.0% year −1 in developed countries and is higher in some developing countries. In turn, the rate of growth in the yield per unit of sustainable harvest, g f, depends on the specific natural resource, where values that were considered in the literature vary from g c down to much lower (even negative) values. Next, the value of 0 ≤ a ≤ 1 (unitless) also depends on the particular system. In a fishery, for example, if non-sustainable harvest would imply catching all the fish and sustainable harvest would imply keeping the fish population size fixed, then a would be the growth rate of the fish (i.e. 2% year −1 for large fish and higher rates for smaller fish); In agriculture, sustainable management implies the use of environmentally friendly pest control methods and effective water management, which may result in a comparable crop yield (α ≲ 1), but may be more expensive (λ > 1). In turn, the ratio between c (t) and the direct costs, C 1 and C 2 (Eq. 9), determines the relative portion of c that is needed per unit of harvest. Specifically, c (and thus the ratio) is initially small but increases due to technological changes. Also, C 1 and C 2 may vary with x 1 and x 2 if the cost varies among regions (e.g. if near-shore regions are depleted, the average direct cost of harvest may increase). Next, note that 0 ≤ μ ≤ 1 (unitless) can be chosen arbitrarily by the policymaker, as it does not affect the harvest strategy and the future value of the natural resource; rather, it determines the currency unit, which, in turn, determines the relative role of the discount and the price in determining the future value of the natural resource. A reasonable choice would be the portion in the basket of goods of the natural resource (e.g. the portion of agricultural products in consumption is ~5% in the United States and is higher in various developing countries), but μ may be higher if non-market goods are incorporated. Finally, a variety of utility functions that incorporate both c and f were suggested in the literature, including the two that are used here (Eqs. B2, B10), where estimates of η vary between 1 and 3 (unitless), and suggested values for ρ varies between 0 and 3% (year −1).

### Towards ethical drug pricing: the European orphan genomic therapies fund [^115ffc6v]. Gene Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

Ethics of pricing classically invoke market mechanisms. For example, the philosopher Alan Wertheimer discusses the idea of a fair and non-exploitative pricing process in his influential book 'Exploitation'. He asserts that a fair and non-exploitative price would be determined in a competitive market and provides both an economic explanation and ethical justifications. The economic explanation is that in a competitive market, both sellers and buyers are price-takers, who have no control over the price and must accept the market-determined price. The ethical justification relates to the moral dimension of the relationship between buyer and seller: in a competitive market, "neither party takes special unfair advantage of particular defects in the other party's decision-making capacity or special vulnerabilities in the other party's situation". However, while this situation is characteristic for an ideal market situation, in the field of novel genomic therapies the situation is significantly different: Firstly, as essential or life-saving therapies, they are 'priceless goods', defined as goods that are widely perceived to have a special non-market value. Secondly, the patients receiving these therapies are highly reliant on the treatment, and thus depend on healthcare providers to pay for them. Thirdly, the sellers are companies that, in the absence of a competitive market, enjoy a monopoly on their products, allowing them to demand whatever reimbursement and reward they believe is appropriate for their innovative therapy. In conclusion, the pricing of innovative genomic therapies seems to be exploitative and unfair based on Wertheimer's ethics of pricing: Without a competitive market, pharmaceutical companies can take advantage of patients' struggles and engage in price gouging, raising prices far above production and investment costs.

### Evidence vs. access: can twenty-first-century drug regulation refine the tradeoffs? [^112LTp8M]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2012). Low credibility.

As the pharmaceutical industry productivity crisis worsens, there are calls for regulatory changes to support innovation. At the same time, prescribers and payers desire more information about drugs at the time they are released to the market. Will new regulatory schemes be able to accommodate these disparate needs?

### High and rising health care costs. part 3: the role of health care providers [^1143uc6K]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

One commonly held explanation for high and rising health care costs in the United States points to the market power of health care providers. This third article of a 4-part series examines how the prices and quantities of health care services interact to influence health care expenditures. The article also reviews cost-containment strategies that are designed to reduce prices and quantities of services. One major difference between the costs of care in the United States and those in other developed nations is the price per unit of care — physician fees, payments per hospital day, and pharmaceutical prices. Greater quantities of high-priced innovative technologies in the United States also contribute to higher expenditures in the United States compared with other nations. During the 1990s, payers were partially successful in slowing cost growth by reducing the prices of physician and hospital payments, but more recently, hospitals increased their market power by consolidation and could demand higher prices. Quantities and costs of services for Medicare beneficiaries vary markedly among geographic regions, with research showing an association between health care costs and the supply of hospital beds and specialist physicians. These findings suggest that limiting the supply of resources may reduce the quantity, and thereby the costs, of health services. Shifting the financial risk of health care costs from insurers to providers, as has been done with the Medicare diagnosis-related-group payment and capitation reimbursement, can also be effective in containing costs.

### Research and development spending to bring a single cancer drug to market and revenues after approval [^114vH5pd]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Importance

A common justification for high cancer drug prices is the sizable research and development (R&D) outlay necessary to bring a drug to the US market. A recent estimate of R&D spending is $2.7 billion (2017 US dollars). However, this analysis lacks transparency and independent replication.

Objective

To provide a contemporary estimate of R&D spending to develop cancer drugs.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Analysis of US Securities and Exchange Commission filings for drug companies with no drugs on the US market that received approval by the US Food and Drug Administration for a cancer drug from January 1, 2006, through December 31, 2015. Cumulative R&D spending was estimated from initiation of drug development activity to date of approval. Earnings were also identified from the time of approval to the present. The study was conducted from December 10, 2016, to March 2, 2017.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Median R&D spending on cancer drug development.

Results

Ten companies and drugs were included in this analysis. The 10 companies had a median time to develop a drug of 7.3 years (range, 5.8–15.2 years). Five drugs (50%) received accelerated approval from the US Food and Drug Administration, and 5 (50%) received regular approval. The median cost of drug development was $648.0 million (range, $157.3 million to $1950.8 million). The median cost was $757.4 million (range, $203.6 million to $2601.7 million) for a 7% per annum cost of capital (or opportunity costs) and $793.6 million (range, $219.1 million to $2827.1 million) for a 9% opportunity costs. With a median of 4.0 years (range, 0.8–8.8 years) since approval, the total revenue from sales of these 10 drugs since approval was $67.0 billion compared with total R&D spending of $7.2 billion ($9.1 billion, including 7% opportunity costs).

Conclusions and Relevance

The cost to develop a cancer drug is $648.0 million, a figure significantly lower than prior estimates. The revenue since approval is substantial (median, $1658.4 million; range, $204.1 million to $22 275.0 million). This analysis provides a transparent estimate of R&D spending on cancer drugs and has implications for the current debate on drug pricing.

### Use of clinical trial characteristics to estimate costs of new drug development [^114nxoyN]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Importance

Despite their importance to patients, health, and industry, the magnitude of investments in drug research and development (R&D) remain nebulous. New policies require more granular and transparent R&D cost estimates to better balance incentives for innovation and returns to developers.

Objective

To estimate per-drug R&D costs using a novel, reproduceable approach and to describe firm-level R&D costs per discrete unit of R&D activity (1 patient-month).

Design, Setting, and Participants

This economic evaluation used cross-sectional data to estimate 2014 to 2019 costs per patient-month. Costs per patient-month were calculated using data from 268 US publicly traded drug developers, contributing 1311 firm-year observations, that were highest ranked by assets or market capitalization, after exclusions. Per-drug costs were calculated from all R&D activity through approval for a cohort of 38 new drugs approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2019. Data were analyzed from January 2022 to July 2024.

Exposure

R&D activity, measured in terms of clinical trial patient-months.

Main Outcomes and Measures

This study used a 2-step approach to estimate R&D costs, first allocating firm-year-level total R&D spending across similarly aggregated patient-months, and then aggregating these incremental costs to estimate drug-level R&D costs per new drug.

Results

Among 268 developers assessed, 20 large firms accounted for 80.8% of all patient-months and had 27.4% lower mean and 26.7% lower median costs per patient-month compared with other firms. Each 1% increase in patient-months was associated with a 0.9% increase in R&D costs. R&D costs per new drug were highly skewed, with a lower median (IQR), at $708 million ($247 million to $1.42 billion) than mean (SD), at $1.31 ($1.92) billion, after adjusting for the cost of capital and discontinued products. Without these adjustments, direct costs per new drug were a median (IQR) of $150 ($67.6-$453) million and a mean (SD) $369 of ($684) million. While estimated R&D costs varied in sensitivity analyses, mean costs were always substantially greater than median costs.

Conclusions and Relevance

This economic evaluation found median per-drug R&D costs toward the lower end of the range from prior studies, with a mean closer to the middle of the existing range despite the broad scope of included costs. These findings suggest parallel development across indications, adjustment for discontinued products, and a small number of expensive development programs are particularly important drivers of R&D costs.

### Anomalous supply shortages from dynamic pricing in on-demand mobility [^114vNwpz]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Dynamic pricing schemes are increasingly employed across industries to maintain a self-organized balance of demand and supply. However, throughout complex dynamical systems, unintended collective states exist that may compromise their function. Here we reveal how dynamic pricing may induce demand-supply imbalances instead of preventing them. Combining game theory and time series analysis of dynamic pricing data from on-demand ride-hailing services, we explain this apparent contradiction. We derive a phase diagram demonstrating how and under which conditions dynamic pricing incentivizes collective action of ride-hailing drivers to induce anomalous supply shortages. We identify characteristic patterns in the price dynamics reflecting these supply anomalies by disentangling different timescales in price time series of ride-hailing services at 137 locations across the globe. Our results provide systemic insights for the regulation of dynamic pricing, in particular in publicly accessible mobility systems, by unraveling under which conditions dynamic pricing schemes promote anomalous supply shortages.

### Utilizing the commodity purchase task to evaluate behavioral economic demand for illicit substances: a review and meta-analysis [^114FsKJ5]. Addiction (2020). Medium credibility.

Background andaims

The commodity purchase task is a simulated demand procedure that is easy and quick to complete (< 5 minutes) as well as adaptable for remote delivery and use with varied study populations. The purpose of this meta-analysis was to synthesize research using the commodity purchase task with illicit substances to evaluate the magnitude of omnibus effects sizes and moderators of the correlation of demand indices with quantity-frequency (QF) and severity measures.

Design

Random-effects meta-analyses and meta-regressions involving studies with cross-sectional correlational designs.

Setting and Participants

Eleven studies, 10 outcomes and 2146 participants from two countries (USA and UK) published up to 1 October 2018.

Measurements

Omnibus effect sizes (correlation coefficients) of five demand indices from the commodity purchase task [intensity (unconstrained consumption), elasticity (price sensitivity), O max (maximum expenditure), P max (price at maximum expenditure) and breakpoint (first price of zero consumption)] with QF and severity measures. Meta-regression models tested moderators of effect sizes (i.e. sample age and sex composition, commodity type and number of prices used in the commodity purchase task).

Findings

Significant omnibus effect sizes were observed with QF and severity measures for intensity (r = 0.32/0.28, QF/severity, respectively), elasticity (r = -0.14/-0.18), O max (r = 0.30/0.29) and breakpoint (r = 0.17/0.22) values. P max was only significantly associated with severity measures (r = 0.15). The percentage of female participants and number of prices used in the purchase task significantly moderated P max and breakpoint effect-size estimates in that stronger associations were observed in samples with a greater percentage of women and in studies using tasks with more price points. Commodity type (cannabis versus cocaine) did not significantly moderate associations involving any demand index.

Conclusions

Behavioral economic demand as measured by the commodity purchase task is consistently correlated with measures of illicit substance use quantity-frequency and severity.

### A framework to predict the price of energy for the end-users with applications to monetary and energy policies [^113LQwXv]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Weight prediction results

The validity of our proposed methodology is tested over a period of 174 months from January 2006 to June 2020, by comparing the predicted value of the monthly weight of each product's demand with its actual, known value. For this comparison, the sum of the squared prediction error for each month is computed over the testing period (see "Methods") and the results in the form of an average sum of squared error, minimum sum of squared error, and maximum sum of squared error are summarized in Table 1. It should be noted that the number of months to be compared decreases as the year of prediction increases. For example, the predictions of the second year require the predicted weights of the first year, so there are less actual monthly values to compare.

Table 1
Weight prediction results up to 4 years from January 2006 to June 2020.

As shown in Table 1, the predictive ability of our proposed methodology is quite remarkable since the reported error values are extremely low. This is true even if we consider the square root of the average sum of the squared errors which is 1.8808%, 2.0874%, 2.2329%, and 2.3641% for the first, second, third, and fourth year, respectively. The very low predictive error (2.3641%) in the case of the fourth year, where only unknown (predicted) values have been used, is of significant importance. As expected, the average sum of the squared error increases, as the year of prediction increases due to the decreasing number of months with known values. The accuracy of the proposed methodology is also verified from the fact that even the maximum sum of squared error over the tested period is rather low, i.e. 0.006685 or 8.1764% when we consider the square root of the sum of the squared errors.

This excellent predictive ability along with the unique inherent characteristics of EPIC that captures both the demands and the prices of the products over the entire energy landscape in the United States justifies our opinion that EPIC is the ideal tool for designing, assessing, and optimizing various policy decisions of public interest. Two prime, representative policy case studies are presented in the next sections.

### Measuring the effects of the new ECOWAS and WAEMU tobacco excise tax directives [^111vWd8w]. Tobacco Control (2021). Medium credibility.

Sensitivity analysis

The assumption that only the tax increase changes retail prices implies that cigarette producers do not change net-of-tax prices to influence demand and/or to protect their profits after a tax increase. In fact, the tobacco industry can change any of the non-tax components, which affects prices and sales volumes. In table 6 we present summarised results of changes in the industry margin in response the new ECOWAS and WAEMU Tax Directives. A decrease in industry margins implies that the tobacco industry bears a part of the additional tax amount, reducing the increase in the retail price and decreasing the reduction in sales volumes compared with full tax pass-through. An increase in industry margins has the opposite effect; retail prices increase by more than the increase in the tax, so sales volumes decrease and tax revenues increase by less than with full pass through. For countries implementing the ECOWAS Directive, industry pricing decisions do not change the overall qualitative results of the model. However, because the impact of the WAEMU Directive on the variables of interest is so small, industry pricing decisions can have a relatively larger impact, and even overturn some of the (modest) gains achieved by the Directive.

Table 6
Sensitivity analysis: percentage of pass through–averages

We also performed sensitivity analysis using a higher (−0.9) and a lower (−0.5) price elasticity of demand than the model's value of −0.7 (table 7 and the online supplemental file for individual country results). The price elasticity of demand is a crucial parameter in determining the impact of tax and price changes on sales volumes. Sales volumes will decrease by 26% if the price elasticity is −0.9 and by 16% if the elasticity is −0.5, compared with 22% with the model's price elasticity of −0.7. The price elasticity estimates of −0.9 and −0.5 are expected to increase average excise revenue by 337% and 412%, respectively, compared with the model scenario of 373%. Given the large increases in taxes required by the ECOWAS Directive for most countries, the choice of elasticity does not alter the direction and the approximate magnitude of the changes.

Table 7
Sensitivity analysis: price elasticity–averages

Changing elasticities when taxes are set at the WAEMU minimum makes little difference to the results because the expected price changes are so small.

### The case for OFSMOKE: how tobacco price regulation is needed to promote the health of markets, government revenue and the public [^114KYB4Q]. Tobacco Control (2010). Low credibility.

Price cap regulation: the basic model and its application in the UK

Price cap regulation has been heavily utilised in the British utilities sector (and elsewhere) as a means of protecting society from the monopoly power of companies which face little or no competition given the nature of the market in question. As such, there are significant parallels to the tobacco industry where a strong case exists for further action to protect society from the effects of market failure. As this market failure applies to cigarette manufacturers rather than retailers, we envisage the system only applying to those manufacturing (rather than retailing) cigarettes for the UK market.

The system works by establishing an independent regulatory agency — The Office for Smoked Tobacco Regulation (OFSMOKE), for example — which would carry out periodic reviews of what cigarette companies are allowed to charge, setting maximum prices allowed for each product. The prices set would be based on how prices in the economy have generally changed (the retail price index (RPI) element), an assessment of the genuine costs each firm faces in its production and operations and an assumption about the productivity improvements it would be expected to make (the X element).

### Pharmaceutical pricing, price controls, and their effects on pharmaceutical sales and research and development expenditures in the European union [^1129TF2c]. Clinical Therapeutics (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Each country in the European Union (EU) currently employs direct price controls or permutations of direct price controls, such as reference pricing or limitations on returns to capital. Some countries also use volume controls. A new proposal that is being discussed would have all of the countries in the EU adopt uniform pricing for each pharmaceutical.

Objective

This paper analyzes the economic effects of free-market pricing individual-country price controls, and uniform EU price controls.

Methods

Microeconomic and mathematical models were used to simulate and predict probable economic outcomes in a comparative static setting.

Results

Price controls may be in the form of price ceilings or price floors. Both forms of price control generate deadweight economic losses in the short run and long run. A uniform EU price for each pharmaceutical sold there would have elements of a price ceiling in some of the countries and of a price floor in other countries. The deadweight loss incurred would be a function of the level at which the uniform price was set by the EU and the price elasticity of demand for each pharmaceutical in each country.

Conclusions

Economic efficiency is maximized in both the short run and long run when prices are set in freely competitive markets. An additional important dimension of Ramsey pricing within a competitive context is that it generates funds for investment in pharmaceutical research and development, which enhances economic efficiency in the long run.

### ACMT position statement on sterile solution shortage [^114MH4jD]. ACMT (2025). High credibility.

American College of Medical Toxicology (ACMT) position — sterile solution shortages are widespread and can affect patient care, with shortages often due to manufacturing problems or increases in demand, and natural disasters have also precipitated critical shortages. In 2017, Hurricane Maria affected a facility that produced nearly 50% of the small volume fluids used in the U.S., and in 2024 Hurricane Helene damaged a facility that produced approximately 60% of the sterile fluid supply for the U.S., illustrating vulnerability when manufacturers consolidate production into a handful of facilities with limited capacity for expansion and a lack of resilience that can lead to critical shortages during plant disruptions or demand surges. ACMT calls upon stakeholders to implement measures to support a more resilient supply chain, with recommendations to "Develop a framework for improving the medical supply chain based on awareness, preparedness, response, and mitigation"., "FDA should collect and maintain data regarding the location of manufacturing plants and capacity of each plant to expand production or if there is flexibility in the type of fluids that can be produced there"., and "Manufacturers should develop contingency plans for redirection of production when there is a shortage of a critical product(s)".

### Different strategies to execute multi-database studies for medicines surveillance in real-world setting: a reflection on the European model [^116n599q]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2020). Medium credibility.

Potential impact of the four strategies on relevant dimensions

In this section, we describe the potential impact of each of the four strategies on the requirements for an infrastructure to inform regulatory decision making in Europe. We used as a reference the description from a recent keynote speech: " timely access to data that is high quality, is actionable and relevant for benefit‐risk assessment, which supports multiple use cases, is representative of the whole of Europe, of sufficient quality and generated through a transparent methodology and is delivered through a platform with robust data governance. " 36 A comparative description of the potential impact of each strategy on the fundamental ENCePP principles of scientific independence and transparency is summarized in Table 2.

Table 2
Potential impact of the four strategies on relevant dimensions

Timeliness is split between the execution time of the three steps: finalization of the protocol, data transformation, and development of analytic procedures (see Figure 1). The time needed for the finalization of the protocol is further split in time to development and time to approval: whereas the latter is not dependent on the strategy, the former may in principle be longer in strategy A, as full involvement of all the partners is supported by design. Time for transformation (local extraction, creation of study variables, and of analytic dataset) is difficult to quantify in strategies A and B, as it depends, for the former, on the local resources and, for the latter, on how complex harmonization of the data transferred to the unique central site is. As for strategies C and D, time for local extraction depends on local resources in strategy C, whereas in strategy D it is optimized, as it builds on the previous extraction to the CDM; and data transformation entails the additional step of transforming and loading the data to the CDM, which in strategy D is carried out prior to any study and, hence, does not increase the study duration, whereas in strategy C it is carried out anew as for each study and the delay is shortened if code from previous studies is reusable. In both strategies C and D, time to create the study variables depends on strategy‐independent choices. Indeed, variables creation may be may be "quick and dirty" if there is urgency to produce preliminary results, because in both strategies the common program running on the CDM may be developed in such a way to create the study variables irrespective of the specific characteristic of the study and of the local data characteristics; or it may take longer when variables creation is study‐specific and database‐tailored, possibly taking into account previous validation studies. Time to develop analytic procedures is not efficient in strategy A, as all the sites are developing their own program. In the other three strategies, where analytic procedure are programmed centrally, time depends on whether programs are available or easily adapted, or study‐specific programs must be developed: many studies conducted in Europe with the strategy C, for instance, have progressively adapted a Java‐based software called Jerboa 27 in order to streamline the process.

### Commentary: soda taxes, obesity, and the shifty behavior of consumers [^1142szeQ]. Preventive Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Rising obesity is a threat to public health, and taxing sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) in order to reduce consumption and thus caloric intake could be a viable policy response. But raising the price of SSB calories will raise the quantity demanded of relatively cheaper calories, and net effect on obesity is unclear. I review the evidence on shifting calorie demand and discuss the viability of soda taxes to achieve improvements in public health.

### Glycolytically impaired drosophila glial cells fuel neural metabolism via β-oxidation [^1117hdBh]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

The nervous system consumes a disproportionally large amount of energy compared to its size. Carbohydrates are the preferred energy source and are imported from circulation at large quantities. Glucose is metabolized glycolytically. The highest glycolytic activity has been associated with glial cells, which produce lactate to fuel neuronal oxidative metabolism –. This metabolic coupling of glial cells and neurons has been termed the "Astrocyte-Neuron Lactate Shuttle" (ANLS) and has been shown to be conserved across species. Under optimal conditions glial cells are able to conserve energy by producing glycogenthat can be used to fuel peaks of neuronal energy demand, or bridge short periods of malnutrition. But is glial glycogen the only alternative fuel used in periods of glucose deprivation?

In the periphery, ketone bodies and fatty acids (FA) are used to produce the energy required to endure malnutrition. The use of FA by the brain to gain energy has been debated –; even though major rate-limiting enzymes of β-oxidation are expressed in the nervous system. It has been suggested that glial cells are capable of performing mitochondrial FA degradation under certain conditions.

Here, we present evidence for the importance of glial mitochondrial ß-oxidation for neuronal function and animal survival in Drosophila. Upon glycolytic impairment or starvation-induced hypoglycemia, genes predicted to function in glial ß-oxidation and ketogenesis become essential to support neuronal function and prevent neurodegeneration. Further, we demonstrate that dysregulation of glial carbohydrate or lipid metabolism induces lipid mobilization from peripheral storage organs. This metabolic interorgan communication is likely mediated by glial lipoprotein GLaz.

### Comparison of sales income and research and development costs for FDA-approved cancer drugs sold by originator drug companies [^112HBSP6]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Importance

High costs and risks of research and development (R&D) have been used to justify the high prices of cancer drugs. However, what the return on R&D investment is, and by extension what a justifiable price might be, is unclear.

Objective

To compare incomes from the sales of cancer drugs with the estimated R&D costs.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This observational study used global pharmaceutical industry sales data to quantify the cumulative incomes generated from the sales of cancer drugs for companies that have held patents or marketing rights (originator companies). All cancer drugs approved by the US Food and Drug Administration from 1989 to 2017 were identified from the United States Food and Drug Administration's website and literature. Itemized product sales data were extracted from the originator companies' consolidated financial reports. For drugs with data missing in specific years, additional data was sought from other public sources, or where necessary, estimated values from known reported values. Drugs were excluded if there were missing data for half or more of the years since approval. Data analysis was conducted from May 2018 to October 2018.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Sales data were expressed in 2017 US dollars with adjustments for inflation. Cumulative incomes from the sales of these drugs were compared against the R&D costs estimated in the literature, which had been adjusted for the costs of capital and trial failure (risk adjusted).

Results

Of the 156 US Food and Drug Administration-approved cancer drugs identified, 99 drugs (63.5%) had data for more than half of the years since approval and were included in the analysis. There was a median of 10 years (range, 1–28 years) of sales data with 1040 data points, 79 (7.6%) of which were estimated. Compared with the total risk-adjusted R&D cost of $794 million (range, $2827-$219 million) per medicine estimated in the literature, by the end of 2017, the median cumulative sales income was $14.50 (range, $3.30-$55.10) per dollar invested for R&D. Median time to fully recover the maximum possible risk-adjusted cost of R&D ($2827 million) was 5 years (range, 2–10 years; n = 56). Cancer drugs continued to generate billion-dollar returns for the originator companies after the end-of-market exclusivity, particularly for biologics.

Conclusions and Relevance

Cancer drugs, through high prices, have generated returns for the originator companies far in excess of possible R&D costs. Lowering prices of cancer drugs and facilitating greater competition are essential for improving patient access, health system's financial sustainability, and future innovation.

### Is the price right? Paying for value today to get more value tomorrow [^1136bNWh]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Consider that when some medications are prescribed and adhered to, healthcare spending declines by lowering emergency admissions. Eleven such medications reduce emergency admissions by hundreds of thousands annually. These drugs essentially displace a non-genericizable service with a genericizable medicine, a logical way to save money in the long run, and yet, if one only scrutinizes the drug's temporary branded cost without considering the alternative of forever relying on emergency department services to manage patients, society could easily end up misallocating resources away from developing such a medicine. Reasons for not performing value assessments on hospital procedures may include a lack of randomized controlled trial data which are important inputs into cost-effectiveness analyses. However, this and other reasons are not insurmountable, and real-world data can provide important information on the effectiveness of an intervention potentially through time series analyses if comparators are not obvious. Comprehending the potential cost-effectiveness of all varieties of healthcare interventions is paramount for enhancing the efficiency of healthcare systems and optimizing the health of populations.

### Trends in prices of popular brand-name prescription drugs in the United States [^113tcX4Z]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

In addition, we did not find evidence that products that entered the market 3 to 6 years ago have different trends compared with other drugs in the first years of availability. This finding, along with the consistent, once- or twice-a-year price increases of most drugs we examined, implies that this cycle will persist throughout the lifetime of a drug in the current, private pharmaceutical insurance market.

Reasonable drug costs for consumers must be balanced with incentives in the pharmaceutical industry to produce innovative drugs that improve and save lives. The United States provides drug companies with the strongest patent protections in the world, but legal strategies in the pharmaceutical industry, such as patenting peripheral aspects of a drug that extend exclusivity rights beyond the original patent and delay generic and biosimilar competition, abuse that liberty. The large discrepancy between the prices of drugs purchased in the United States and drugs purchased in the rest of the worldis often attributed to the legal inability of public and private insurers to negotiate drug prices. Innovative solutions, such as the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review's value-based price benchmark, have the potential to find appropriate price points for patients while rewarding drug manufacturers that produce transformative products.

Limitations

A limitation of this study was the lack of information on rebates and how they affected net prices. Rebates are issued in bulk and cannot be linked to individual claims. Rebates vary by drug and by payer, with 16% of all private insurer-branded drug spending returned as rebates in 2016. Proponents argue that rebates can reduce costs, whereas opponents argue that pharmaceutical companies simply raise list prices to offset losses from rebates and increase profits. To address the lack of rebate data, we obtained third-party estimates of net price data on each drug. We observed high correlation between increases in the rates of insurer and out-of-pocket costs paid for each drug and the net prices (ρ = 0.55). This association suggests that the offered supposition that higher list prices and greater reliance on rebates reduce costs may be untrue. Instead, increases in list prices, and thus increases in insurer and out-of-pocket costs paid, may coincide with increases in net prices, which in turn make these drugs more expensive overall. Seemingly biannual price increases should not be considered benign pricing strategies to offset paid against net price discrepancies in the current rebate system. Greater transparency is needed.

### Resilience of the Eastern African electricity sector to climate driven changes in hydropower generation [^112nQ9qf]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Figure 4 compares the cumulative consumer electricity expenditure for the most resilient strategy to the worst-case scenario (NA strategy for the driest climate) expressed as a percentage difference from the baseline for selected EAPP countries. Average change on a power-pool scale is small and reflects the fact that Egypt — the country with the highest electricity demand in the EAPP — tends to drive power-pool level performance indicators. Ethiopia and Uganda stand to benefit the most from choosing the most resilient strategy over their respective worst case options, with cumulative electricity expenditure, over 2017–2050, dropping from +27% to +1% and from +28% to −18.5% respectively relative to the baseline. These translate to savings of approximately USD 2010 19 billion and USD 2010 4 billion in consumer expenditure in Ethiopia and Uganda respectively. In the case of Tanzania, despite having sizable amounts of fossil fuel in the generation mix, a drier climate leads to increased electricity imports as large quantities of fossil investment in the short period is not allowed. These risk causing electricity price fluctuations if proper import power purchase agreements and sufficient transmission infrastructure are not in place.

### The effect of taxation on tobacco consumption and public revenues in Lebanon [^111XfRCE]. Tobacco Control (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Tobacco consumption rates in Lebanon are among the highest worldwide. The country ratified the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control in 2005. A law was passed in 2011 which regulates smoking in closed public spaces, bans advertising, and stipulates larger warnings. Despite international evidence confirming that increasing taxation on tobacco products lowers tobacco consumption, no such policy has yet been adopted: a cigarette pack costs on average US$1.50. To date no studies in Lebanon have addressed the welfare and public finance effects of increasing taxes on tobacco products.

Methods

Using the 2005 national survey of household living conditions, we estimate an almost ideal demand system to generate price elasticities of demand for tobacco. Using estimated elasticities and a conservative scenario for expected smuggling, we simulate the consumption and tax revenue effects of a change in the price of tobacco under various tax schemes.

Results

Increasing taxes on all tobacco products so as to double the price of imported cigarettes would lower their consumption by 7% and consumption of domestically produced cigarettes by over 90%. Young adults (ages 15–30) are more sensitive: consumption would drop by 9% for imported cigarettes and by 100% for domestic cigarettes. Government revenues would increase by approximately 52%.

Conclusions

The estimated elasticities indicate that an increase in taxes on all tobacco products would lead to a reduction in consumption and an increase in government revenue. Evidence from Lebanon on the effectiveness of increased taxation may help initiate national debate on the need to raise taxes.

### Price elasticity of cigarette smoking in Bangladesh: evidence from the global adult tobacco surveys (GATS) [^114SBJVV]. Tobacco Control (2024). Medium credibility.

Total cigarette price elasticity

Total elasticity estimates were given by the sum of prevalence and intensity elasticity estimates. Table 4 contains the results.

Table 4
Total cigarette price elasticity using GATS data

The price elasticity of cigarette demand varied between −0.51 and −0.73 in different specifications. Estimation in model 3 was the most accurate, as it additionally controlled for tobacco-related covariates. Therefore, it can be asserted that a 10% increase in cigarette price would lead to, on average, a 7.3% fall in cigarette demand in Bangladesh. The cigarette demand, therefore, responds less than proportionately to the cigarette price and can be considered price inelastic. Additionally, since the magnitude of elasticity remained less than one (in absolute terms) for all models and in both wealth groups, it is inelastic regardless of people's wealth status. Considering model 3 for the high-wealth group, a 10% increase in cigarette price would lead to a decrease in cigarette demand of 4.1%, while the same percentage of price change would bring a reduction in cigarette demand as high as 9.2% in the low-wealth group.

This finding is of crucial importance in the context of Bangladesh, particularly because of the high prevalence of tobacco smoking in the lower wealth quintiles (48.8% and 26.3% in the lowest and highest wealth quintile, respectively). Thus, an increase in cigarette price would be more effective in reducing smoking prevalence in low-wealth groups. An estimation, taking into account the areas of residence, showed that the magnitude of total cigarette price elasticity is marginally higher in rural areas than in urban ones. However, cigarette demand was price inelastic regardless of the area of residence. In rural areas, the elasticity varied between −0.48 and −0.71, while in urban, it ranged between −0.45 and −0.62. Relative income differences could be the underlying reason for this differential impact. People living in rural areas generally have lower incomes and are therefore more responsive to price changes than those in urban areas.

### How to implement new diagnostic products in low-resource settings: an end-to-end framework [^116fXx4A]. BMJ Global Health (2018). Medium credibility.

Table 2
Key stakeholders involved in introducing diagnostic products to low-resource settings

Market research is conducted to better understand the projected growth, size and share of the market(s) in which the product will be sold, how the product will be distributed to the end user, customer needs and preferences and the product's competitive advantage. These activities inform others, such as development of the marketing plan, user-requirements document and the business case. The business case provides evidence to justify the need for the new diagnostic product and why pursuing its development will be a viable business opportunity. Developers also prepare a financial model that provides details around the initial investment cost, projected sales, payback period and breakeven point and other investment performance considerations, such as whether the efforts of developers, are likely to yield an acceptable return on investment. Typically, the business case and financial model are updated throughout the development process as more information becomes available and the decision to continue with development is re-evaluated at the end of each development phase.

### The law of diminishing returns in clinical medicine: how much risk reduction is enough? [^11256Lhd]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

The law of diminishing returns, first described by economists to explain why, beyond a certain point, additional inputs produce smaller and smaller outputs, offers insight into many situations encountered in clinical medicine. For example, when the risk of an adverse event can be reduced in several different ways, the impact of each intervention can generally be shown mathematically to be reduced by the previous ones. The diminishing value of successive interventions is further reduced by adverse consequences (eg, drug-drug, drug-disease, and drug-nutrient interactions), as well as by the total expenditures of time, energy, and resources, which increase with each additional intervention. It is therefore important to try to prioritize interventions based on patient-centered goals and the relative impact and acceptability of the interventions. We believe that this has implications for clinical practice, research, and policy.

### Concurrent validity of the marijuana purchase task: a meta-analysis of trait-level cannabis demand and cannabis involvement [^115iVWsR]. Addiction (2023). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

The Marijuana Purchase Task (MPT) is increasingly used to measure cannabis reinforcing value and has potential use for cannabis etiological and regulatory research. This meta-analysis sought to evaluate for the first time the MPT's concurrent validity in relation to cannabis involvement.

Methods

Electronic databases and pre-print repositories were searched for MPT studies that examined the cross-sectional relationship between frequency and quantity of cannabis use, problems, dependence, and five MPT indicators: intensity (i.e. unrestricted consumption), O max (i.e. maximum consumption), P max (i.e. price at which demand becomes elastic), breakpoint (i.e. first price at which consumption ceases), and elasticity (i.e. sensitivity to rising costs). Random effects meta-analyses of cross-sectional effect sizes were conducted, with Q tests for examining differences by cannabis variables, meta-regression to test quantitative moderators, and publication bias assessment. Moderators included sex, number of MPT prices, variable transformations, and year of publication. Populations included community and clinical samples.

Results

The searches yielded 14 studies (n = 4077, median % females: 44.8%: weighted average age = 29.08 [SD = 6.82]), published between 2015 and 2022. Intensity, O max, and elasticity showed the most robust concurrent validity (|r's| = 0.147–325, ps < 0.014) with the largest significant effect sizes for quantity (|r| intensity = 0.325) and cannabis dependence (|r| O max = 0.320, |r| intensity = 0.305, |r| elasticity = 0.303). Higher proportion of males was associated with increased estimates for elasticity-quantity and P max -problems. Higher number of MPT prices significantly altered magnitude of effects sizes for P max and problems, suggesting biased estimations if excessively low prices are considered. Methodological quality was generally good, and minimal evidence of publication bias was observed.

Conclusions

The marijuana purchase task presents adequate concurrent validity to measure cannabis demand, most robustly for intensity, O max, and elasticity. Moderating effects by sex suggest potentially meaningful sex differences in the reinforcing value of cannabis.

### How major restaurant chains plan their menus: the role of profit, demand, and health [^1123h4Ds]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Increased away-from-home eating is associated with lower diet quality, and may contribute to the increasing prevalence of overweight and obesity. Healthier food choices in restaurants may help mitigate the rise in obesity and improve diet quality. This study sought to understand the views of executives at major U.S. restaurant chains regarding the process, motivation for, and challenges of offering healthier options on their menus.

Methods

The Healthy Menu Study used in-depth structured telephone interviews with 41 senior menu development and marketing executives at leading casual dining and fast-food restaurant chains. The interview guide covered menu trends, influences on introduction and continuation of new menu items, and barriers to adding healthy foods. Data analysis included tabulation of responses, identification of themes, and examination of subgroup differences.

Results

Growing sales and increasing profits are the most important considerations, mentioned by 61% of respondents; health and nutrition were noted as important by 21%. Restaurants may try to avoid losing groups with a "health seeker" by offering healthier foods (low in fat and calories, more fruits and vegetables) (27% of chains), but operators believe demand for healthier foods is not widespread. Additional obstacles to including healthier menu items are short shelf life of produce (46%), increased preparation time, low sales, and high labor costs.

Conclusions

Not surprisingly, profit margins are the primary determinants of why restaurants do or do not add and continue to serve healthier food options. Without an increase in consumer demand, it is unlikely the restaurant industry will increase their offering of healthy food choices. Insight into the restaurant industry perspective is important for developing promising strategies to encourage healthier eating patterns.

### Production of adenovirus vectors and their use as a delivery system for influenza vaccines [^113dXo4Y]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2010). Low credibility.

Importance Of The Field

With the emergence of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 viruses that have crossed species barriers and are responsible for lethal infections in humans in many countries, there is an urgent need for the development of effective vaccines which can be produced in large quantities at a short notice and confer broad protection against these H5N1 variants. In order to meet the potential global vaccine demand in a pandemic scenario, new vaccine-production strategies must be explored in addition to the currently used egg-based technology for seasonal influenza.

Areas Covered In This Review

Adenovirus (Ad) based influenza vaccines represent an attractive alternative/supplement to the currently licensed egg-based influenza vaccines. Ad-based vaccines are relatively inexpensive to manufacture, and their production process does not require either chicken eggs or labor-intensive and time-consuming processes necessitating enhanced biosafety facilities. Most importantly, in a pandemic situation, this vaccine strategy could offer a stockpiling option to reduce the response time before a strain-matched vaccine could be developed.

What The Reader Will Gain

This review discusses Ad-vector technology and the current progress in the development of Ad-based influenza vaccines.

Take Home Message

Ad vector-based influenza vaccines for pandemic preparedness are under development to meet global vaccine demand.

### Affordability and availability of off-patent drugs in the United States-the case for importing from abroad: observational study [^1176ivuE]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

In recent years, shortages and dramatic price increases have been observed among some generic drugs in the United States. The value of generic medicines lies in the fact that, when effectively overseen by drug regulators, these drug treatments are widely used and less expensive while still being equally safe and efficacious alternatives to brand name drugs that are no longer protected by patents. In 2016, generic drugs constituted 89% of dispensed medicines in the USA and only 27% of overall drug spending. Appropriate use of generic drugs increases patient adherence, improves health outcomes, and generates substantial savings for US taxpayers and patients.

Generic drug treatments are inexpensive partly because of competition among manufacturers with regulatory approval to market the drugs. Broad competition from multiple independent competitors exists for most off-patent drugs that are in large markets and easy to manufacture, driving down prices. But in recent years, a problem has emerged with some older drugs or those used in smaller populations, making these products susceptible to shortages and dramatic price increases. As more time passes after expiration of a brand name drug's market exclusivity, more companies complete the regulatory process to sell their versions of that drug in the US market and offer discounts to gain market share, which eventually drives the price of that drug closer to its marginal cost. At that point, any manufacturers of the drug will only continue to make that product if the cost of its production remains low or if there are strong synergies with that firm's other product lines. In addition, with profit margins so thin, prospective competitors have little incentive to incur the start-up costs and time required to gain regulatory approval and manufacture that drug. This dynamic is even more acute with drugs used in only small patient populations, since the potential revenues may have already been modest at the outset.

### Value-based healthcare: controlling costs through a value analysis committee [^112zQhjx]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Principle 3: Compare Costs to Similar Solutions

Supply chain and finance specialists should provide summary information on pricing, cost comparisons, and general reimbursement for co-chair and general committee review. Transparency from the hospital and/or healthcare system is important to make sound and informed decisions. The physician proposing a new product should work with a supply chain representative to accurately identify similar adopted products and essentially equivalent products on the market for cost comparisons. At the direction of the committee, adopting a new solution may require replacing an existing and similar solution to improve negotiated pricing and supply chain efficiency. Committee members should pause and reflect on whether a proposed new product that addresses the same clinical need as an existing product will add cost without improving quality.

### Economic evaluation studies [^11178yMD]. Chest (2020). Medium credibility.

Economic evaluations, including cost-effectiveness analyses, are frameworks for decision-making. They help to illustrate tradeoffs between selecting one choice over another. This form of analysis is of great power and value to the health-care system. Health-care decisions are complex; they require synthesis of a myriad of data variables and sources, and the impact of the choices made is significant. Given this importance and the increasing demand and complexity of health decisions, it is imperative to ensure that economic evaluations are of high quality, comprehensive, and follow the guidelines and recommendations of experts in the field. This article provides an overview of the types of economic evaluations and their role in decision-making. It also discusses key study design considerations, including methods, scope, results, and reporting. Links to published checklists are provided along with additional sources of information, including a glossary of terms (Appendix), to guide the researcher to produce high-quality economic evaluations and guide the reviewer to provide high-quality feedback during the review process.

### Medicines with one seller and many buyers: strategies to increase the power of the payer [^116JjZgv]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Health system budgets face increasing pressures from ageing populations, epidemiological transitions, and technological innovation. One area for buyers to find savings is in questioning whether the price they negotiate for a medicine is fair.

This challenge of high prices is particularly acute for medicines that are available from a single source, where there is no alternative with a similar indication. Monopolies can use several techniques to consolidate their market power and maintain a high price. For example, they may emphasise slightly different indications of their medicine from those of competitors, marketing small differences in benefits and risks that may not be clinically meaningful.

Health systems face consequences when markets fail because of a lack of competition: budgets need to increase, the needs of some patients are prioritised over others, out-of-pocket spending increases, and some patients do not receive treatment.

A lack of affordability for patients is a unique type of market failure. Patients usually have limited power to select the medicine they need as this is usually the domain of doctors or other health workers. Patients also rarely negotiate the price of medicines, as this is usually the responsibility of governments and third party payers. The final price can also be increased by wholesaler and pharmacy mark-ups, or reduced by rebates and discounts. A lack of transparency distorts the market for medicines, where demand does not tend to depend on the price.

Yet even when there is only one supplier, buyers are not powerless. Health systems have used several approaches to negotiate a fairer price for medicines. These include strategies for improving the selection process for which medicines to cover in their health system, and benchmarking to determine a fair price to pay for those medicines. This article provides a review of several common strategies undertaken by countries in developing their pharmaceutical pricing policies, outlining their benefits and risks to buyers seeking to achieve fairer pricing for medicines. Ultimately a successful strategy to achieve fair pricing requires transparency and cooperation, both among buyers and among other stakeholders.

### Association between market competition and prices of generic topical dermatology drugs [^112QbgnD]. JAMA Dermatology (2018). Medium credibility.

Importance

During the last decade, increases in drug prices for commonly prescribed dermatologic medications have outpaced the rate of inflation, national health care growth, and reimbursements. Among nondermatologic medications, studies have shown a role for robust generic market competition in reducing drug prices. The association between competition and the costs of topical dermatologic generic drugs has not been evaluated.

Objective

To characterize the association between changes in drug price and the number of US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved manufacturers among the most commonly used topical dermatologic generic products.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This retrospective cost analysis of the most commonly prescribed topical dermatologic generic drugs used cumulative annual claims data from the Medicare Part D Prescriber Public User File to identify 597 dermatologist-prescribed drugs with more than 10 claims. The number of manufacturers and the price per unit were identified from the FDA Orange Book and the National Average Drug Acquisition Cost (NADAC) database, respectively, for 2013 through 2016. Drugs that were nondermatologic, were not topically administered, were missing NADAC data, were lacking a generic formulation, or had fewer than 400 claims were excluded.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Primary outcomes included per-unit drug price and number of FDA-approved manufacturers. Pricing measures were adjusted for inflation and are reported in 2016 dollars.

Results

The present analysis included 116 topical dermatologic generic formulations, representing 70.5% of the total Medicare Part D dermatologist-coded claims from 2015. Drug formulations with 1 to 2 manufacturers during the study period sustained a median percentage increase in price of 12.7%, whereas those with more than 6 manufacturers had a median percentage decrease in price of 20.5%. Formulations with 1 to 2 manufacturers had a 20.6%, 19.5%, and 33.2% higher percentage increase in price than those with 3 to 4 manufacturers, 5 to 6 manufacturers, and more than 6 manufacturers, respectively. There was a statistically significant inverse association between the percentage change in drug price and median number of manufacturers (Spearman correlation coefficient, -0.26; P = 0.005).

Conclusions and Relevance

The negative association between the change in drug price and the median number of manufacturers of generic topical dermatologic drugs indicates a role for market competition in controlling the costs of generic drug prices within dermatology. These findings support policies that facilitate robust market competition among topical dermatologic generic drugs produced by a limited number of manufacturers.

### An empirical analysis of cigarette demand in Argentina [^111V7SuD]. Tobacco Control (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To estimate the long-term and short-term effects on cigarette demand in Argentina based on changes in cigarette price and income per person > 14years old.

Method

Public data from the Ministry of Economics and Production were analysed based on monthly time series data between 1994 and 2010. The econometric analysis used cigarette consumption per person > 14years of age as the dependent variable and the real income per person > 14years old and the real average price of cigarettes as independent variables. Empirical analyses were done to verify the order of integration of the variables, to test for cointegration to capture the long-term effects and to capture the short-term dynamics of the variables.

Results

The demand for cigarettes in Argentina was affected by changes in real income and the real average price of cigarettes. The long-term income elasticity was equal to 0.43, while the own-price elasticity was equal to -0.31, indicating a 10% increase in the growth of real income led to an increase in cigarette consumption of 4.3% and a 10% increase in the price produced a fall of 3.1% in cigarette consumption. The vector error correction model estimated that the short-term income elasticity was 0.25 and the short-term own-price elasticity of cigarette demand was -0.15. A simulation exercise showed that increasing the price of cigarettes by 110% would maximise revenues and result in a potentially large decrease in total cigarette consumption.

Conclusion

Econometric analyses of cigarette consumption and their relationship with cigarette price and income can provide valuable information for developing cigarette price policy.

### The case for OFSMOKE: how tobacco price regulation is needed to promote the health of markets, government revenue and the public [^115qP8SU]. Tobacco Control (2010). Low credibility.

Problems with the current tobacco market and the tobacco pricing system

Market failure

Mainstream economic theory outlines four main causes of market failure: information failure or asymmetry, externalities such as the external costs imposed on others through the manufacture and use of tobacco, the provision of public goods and market power. That two of these (information failure and externalities) exist in a tobacco market has already been clearly outlinedand is not dwelt on further here. Instead, we outline how market power also exists.

The number of major tobacco transnationals has been declining following numerous mergers and acquisitions such that there are now only four dominating the global tobacco market outside China: Philip Morris International, British American Tobacco, Japan Tobacco International and Imperial Tobacco. Consequently, the cigarette trade is dominated in virtually all major markets by a very small, and declining, number of cigarette manufacturing companies (table 1). In 2008, for example, notwithstanding the publicly owned Chinese National Tobacco Company which has a 98% share of the Chinese market, the leading company in each of the world's largest cigarette markets had a market share of between 28% and 86% (table 1). The most striking indication of the highly concentrated nature of cigarette sales is the three-firm concentration ratio — the total market share in each country accounted for by the three companies with the largest market share. With the exception of Indonesia, in all the major markets just three firms control at least 80% of the market, and in many markets the top three firms account for more than 90% (table 1). To put such figures into perspective, the UK Competition Commission investigates mergers between companies that would result in firms gaining more than 25% market share or less where it appears likely there would be a substantial lessening of competition.

### Price and utilization: why we must target both to curb health care costs [^112oMe8B]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

The United States spends nearly $8000 per person on health care annually. Even for a wealthy country, this amount is substantially more than would be expected and 2.5 times the average spent by other Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries. The growth rate of health care spending in the United States has also far outpaced that in all other high-income OECD countries since 1970, even accounting for population growth. This increase in health spending threatens to squeeze out critical investments in education and infrastructure. To successfully develop and implement policies that effectively address both the level and growth of U.S. health care costs, it is critical to first understand cost drivers. Many health policy and economics scholars have contributed to an ongoing debate on whether to blame high prices or high utilization of services for escalating health care spending in the United States. This paper argues that price and volume both contribute to high and increasing health care costs, along with high administrative costs, supply issues, and the fee-for-service payment system. Initial strategies to contain costs might include implementation and expansion of bundled payment systems and competitive bidding.

### Association of research and development investments with treatment costs for new drugs approved from 2009 to 2018 [^1122kp7Z]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

In theory, many factors could be associated with prices charged by drug companies for their products. These factors include the therapeutic value of a product, aggregate demand for a drug (which is largely associated with disease prevalence), duration of market exclusivity, price sensitivity of demand (as companies may charge higher prices if they believe consumers are unlikely to discontinue therapy), competitiveness of the market (the availability of therapeutic substitutes could put downward pressure on drug prices, although the evidence is mixed on whether this happens in practice,), and the portfolio of the company (with larger firms selling many products and potentially adopting different pricing strategies vs smaller firms with few products on the market). Many of these factors were accounted for, at least partially, through variables in the present study, such as duration of exclusivity, orphan status (proxy for aggregate demand), clinical benefit (proxy for therapeutic value), and whether a product was first in class or next in class (proxy for degree of competition). We observed that first-in-class and orphan drugs were associated with higher costs at launch. Other factors, such as clinical benefit and duration of exclusivity, had no consistent association with how much drug companies charged for the therapeutic agents in the sample. Although there is growing consensus that the prices of new drugs should be aligned with the value the new products deliver, we found no association between the clinical benefit of a new product and prices. This finding is in line with results from a previous study of cancer therapies.

Prevention funding and incentive realignment — policy context — emphasizes that "Today's federal programs pay minimal attention to prevention health services" and that "Public and private investment in sick care (especially low-leverage and end-of-life care) should not be allowed to crowd out higher-leverage investments in prevention that can produce more social benefit for the same cost". It calls for parity by stating "There should be parity in the funding of high value evidence-based preventive services in both public and private programs", and notes that certain benefit designs "actually create disincentives to healing and healthful behavior".

### Pancreatic β-cell adaptive plasticity in obesity increases insulin production but adversely affects secretory function [^1137uHFA]. Diabetes (2016). Low credibility.

Pancreatic β-cells normally produce adequate insulin to control glucose homeostasis, but in obesity-related diabetes, there is a presumed deficit in insulin production and secretory capacity. In this study, insulin production was assessed directly in obese diabetic mouse models, and proinsulin biosynthesis was found to be contrastingly increased, coupled with a significant expansion of the rough endoplasmic reticulum (without endoplasmic reticulum stress) and Golgi apparatus, increased vesicular trafficking, and a depletion of mature β-granules. As such, β-cells have a remarkable capacity to produce substantial quantities of insulin in obesity, which are then made available for immediate secretion to meet increased metabolic demand, but this comes at the price of insulin secretory dysfunction. Notwithstanding, it can be restored. Upon exposing isolated pancreatic islets of obese mice to normal glucose concentrations, β-cells revert back to their typical morphology with restoration of regulated insulin secretion. These data demonstrate an unrealized dynamic adaptive plasticity of pancreatic β-cells and underscore the rationale for transient β-cell rest as a treatment strategy for obesity-linked diabetes.
