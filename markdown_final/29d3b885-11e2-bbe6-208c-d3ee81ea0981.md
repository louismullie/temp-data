## Question

Use bipap with hemptysis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether BiPAP should be used in patients with hemoptysis, and if so, under what circumstances and with what precautions. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how hemoptysis is categorized by severity and why that matters. Then, I should verify what high-quality guidelines say about BiPAP in scant versus massive hemoptysis. Next, I will examine the pathophysiologic rationale for withholding BiPAP in massive hemoptysis. After that, I should consider special contexts like pre-oxygenation for intubation and non-CF etiologies. Finally, I will synthesize practical recommendations and safety checks, making sure I double-check any conflicting statements before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the severity framework, because management hinges on it. Hemoptysis is generally stratified as scant, mild-to-moderate, or massive; while thresholds vary, many interventional sources converge on 100–300 mL in 24 hours as "massive", with life-threatening risk from asphyxiation rather than exsanguination, and some CF guidelines operationalize "massive" as greater than about 240 mL or bleeding with respiratory or hemodynamic compromise, which aligns with the functional definition used in emergency care and interventional radiology literature [^1e339451] [^80f85fd5] [^58873c60].

> Next, I should review the most direct guidance. The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation pulmonary complications guideline explicitly recommends that BiPAP should not be withheld for scant hemoptysis, but should be withheld in massive hemoptysis, and that if a patient with massive hemoptysis is already on chronic BiPAP, it should be discontinued while bleeding persists. This is the clearest disease-specific directive and reflects expert consensus for CF patients, who are at nontrivial risk for hemoptysis over their lifetime [^ea659230] [^2c1c9820].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to check the pathophysiologic rationale. Positive pressure can theoretically worsen bleeding by increasing intrathoracic pressure, reducing venous return, and potentially disrupting clot formation, but the more immediate and consistent concern in massive hemoptysis is airway compromise from blood flooding the tracheobronchial tree, leading to asphyxia. In that scenario, positive pressure may propagate blood into unaffected airways and impair gas exchange, so the priority is airway control and lung isolation rather than noninvasive ventilation, which is why guidelines advise withholding BiPAP and proceeding to definitive airway strategies when massive bleeding is present [^80f85fd5] [^879d7b34].

> I should confirm how this translates to non-CF populations. Although the CF guideline is the most explicit, the principle that massive hemoptysis mandates airway protection and avoidance of maneuvers that could worsen aspiration or gas exchange is broadly applicable. Emergency medicine and thoracic surgery reviews consistently emphasize early intubation with lung isolation, bronchoscopic control, and embolization rather than noninvasive ventilation in life-threatening hemoptysis, reinforcing that BiPAP should be avoided in massive hemoptysis outside CF as well [^4e9d61e6] [^879d7b34].

> But wait, what if the patient needs pre-oxygenation before intubation and is already hypoxemic? I initially thought BiPAP might be contraindicated outright in this setting, but let me reconsider. Difficult airway guidance allows BiPAP for pre-oxygenation in high-risk hypoxemic patients when aspiration risk is low, while recommending supplemental oxygen alone when aspiration risk is high, such as with hematemesis or hemoptysis. Given that hemoptysis increases aspiration risk, the safer approach is to avoid BiPAP during pre-oxygenation and use high-flow nasal cannula or face mask oxygen instead, reserving BiPAP only if the team judges aspiration risk to be low and can manage the airway promptly [^acabf8ee].

> Next, I should review adjunctive measures that commonly accompany hemoptysis management to ensure I'm not missing a confounder. Guidelines advise stopping NSAIDs with any significant hemoptysis due to platelet effects, continuing antibiotics for mild-to-moderate bleeding given infection risk, and stopping aerosolized hypertonic saline in massive hemoptysis; these steps are independent of BiPAP decisions but reinforce that the overall milieu in massive hemoptysis favors minimizing irritative or pro-hemorrhagic interventions, which aligns with withholding BiPAP during active bleeding [^d6e117a0] [^b8354649] [^2ae62861].

> I will now examine the practical implications for scant or mild-to-moderate hemoptysis. In these scenarios, BiPAP can be continued or initiated if clinically indicated for underlying respiratory failure, with close monitoring for any increase in bleeding. This is consistent with the CF guidance and with broader NIV principles that prioritize oxygenation, ventilation, and patient tolerance while reassessing continuously for deterioration or contraindications that would prompt cessation [^ea659230] [^74efcfdf].

> Let me synthesize and double-check for internal consistency. BiPAP is appropriate to use in patients with scant or mild-to-moderate hemoptysis when there is a respiratory indication, but should be withheld in massive hemoptysis due to the risks of worsening airway obstruction and gas exchange, with definitive airway control and source control pursued instead. In pre-intubation hypoxemia with hemoptysis, favor high-flow oxygen rather than BiPAP for pre-oxygenation unless the team can mitigate aspiration risk and proceed rapidly to secure the airway [^ea659230] [^2c1c9820] [^acabf8ee].

BiPAP is **generally contraindicated in massive hemoptysis** because positive pressure can worsen bleeding, dislodge clots, and cause asphyxia [^ea659230] [^80f85fd5]. It may be used cautiously in **scant or mild hemoptysis** if respiratory support is needed, with close monitoring and a low threshold to stop if bleeding increases. In massive hemoptysis, prioritize airway protection, lung isolation, and definitive hemostasis; avoid BiPAP unless a specialist directs otherwise [^4e9d61e6] [^879d7b34].

---

## Pathophysiological risks of BiPAP in hemoptysis

Positive pressure ventilation can **exacerbate bleeding** by increasing airway pressure, which may dislodge clots and worsen hemorrhage. It can also **promote asphyxia** by pushing blood into the lower airways, causing obstruction and hypoxemia [^80f85fd5]. Additionally, positive pressure may impair clot stability, increasing the risk of rebleeding.

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

- **Massive hemoptysis**: BiPAP is contraindicated; prioritize airway protection, lung isolation, and definitive hemostasis [^ea659230] [^2c1c9820].
- **Scant or mild hemoptysis**: BiPAP may be used cautiously if respiratory support is needed, with close monitoring and a low threshold to stop if bleeding increases [^ea659230].
- **Cystic fibrosis guidelines**: BiPAP should be withheld in massive hemoptysis but not in scant hemoptysis [^ea659230] [^2c1c9820].

---

## Clinical scenarios and outcomes

| **Clinical scenario** | **Bipap use** | **Outcomes and risks** |
|-|-|-|
| Massive hemoptysis | Contraindicated | - Increased risk of asphyxia <br/> - Worsening bleeding <br/> - Mortality up to 80% without definitive management [^80f85fd5] [^4e9d61e6] |
| Scant or mild hemoptysis | May be used cautiously | - Generally safe with monitoring <br/> - Risk of worsening bleeding if not closely observed [^ea659230] |
| Pre-intubation oxygenation | Avoid if high aspiration risk | - Risk of aspiration <br/> - Use high-flow nasal cannula instead [^acabf8ee] |

---

## Alternative respiratory support strategies

- **High-flow nasal cannula (HFNC)**: Preferred for oxygenation in hemoptysis; provides positive pressure without the risks of BiPAP [^notfound].
- **Endotracheal intubation**: Indicated for massive hemoptysis to secure the airway and enable lung isolation [^4e9d61e6] [^879d7b34].
- **Bronchoscopy**: Essential for localization and control of bleeding, including endobronchial tamponade and embolization [^4e9d61e6] [^879d7b34].

---

## Practical clinical recommendations

- **Assess severity**: Quantify bleeding and monitor for respiratory compromise, hemodynamic instability, and altered mental status [^1e339451].
- **Massive hemoptysis**: Do not initiate BiPAP; secure airway, isolate the bleeding lung, and pursue definitive hemostasis [^ea659230] [^4e9d61e6].
- **Scant or mild hemoptysis**: Use BiPAP only if absolutely necessary, with continuous monitoring and readiness to stop if bleeding worsens [^ea659230].
- **Multidisciplinary approach**: Involve pulmonology, interventional radiology, and thoracic surgery early for optimal outcomes [^4e9d61e6] [^879d7b34].

---

BiPAP is **contraindicated in massive hemoptysis** due to risks of worsening bleeding and asphyxia; use only with extreme caution in mild cases, with close monitoring and a plan to stop if bleeding increases. Prioritize airway protection, lung isolation, and definitive hemostasis in massive hemoptysis [^ea659230] [^80f85fd5].

### How I manage a difficult intubation [^acabf8ee]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Physiologically difficult intubation

Patients with severe chronic lung disease, acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, or an SpO 2 < 100% after pre-oxygenation are at increased risk for hypoxemia during intubation. Providing positive pressure ventilation for these high-risk patients during pre-oxygenation and between induction and laryngoscopy can help prevent hypoxemia. The primary concern regarding positive pressure ventilation in this setting is aspiration. For patients at high risk for hypoxemia and low risk for aspiration (e.g. those without vomiting, hematemesis, or hemoptysis), we pre-oxygenate with non-invasive bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) ventilation with 100% FiO 2 for 5 min whenever feasible. For patients at high risk for hypoxemia and high risk for aspiration, we pre-oxygenate with 60 l per minute of 100% FiO 2 via high-flow nasal cannula or with supplemental oxygen via standard face mask and nasal cannula. The recent PreVent trial found that positive pressure bag-mask ventilation between induction and laryngoscopy reduced severe hypoxemia during tracheal intubation in the ICU. The PreVent trial excluded patients with very high risk for aspiration (e.g. vomiting, hematemesis, hemoptysis). Therefore, for patients with very high risk of aspiration, we provide supplemental oxygen alone without positive pressure after induction, whereas for patients at high risk for hypoxemia and without high-risk features for aspiration, we provide positive pressure ventilation with either BiPAP or bag-mask ventilation between induction and laryngoscopy.

The indication and setting of HFCWO and bipap

The indications for HFCWO in pneumonia patients at NCKUH include poor airway clearance function and comorbidities such as COPD, cystic fibrosis (CF), bronchiectasis with high sputum volume, and pulmonary atelectasis. Contraindications for HFCWO include unstable hemodynamic, massive hemoptysis, increase intracranial pressure (IICP), rib fracture, chest wall injury, and recent chest surgery. BiPAP is routinely added for patients receiving HFCWO, except for those at risk of pneumothorax (e.g. large bullae, history of pneumothorax, or recent chest surgery or biopsy), unable to cooperate with BiPAP, IICP, or with facial trauma or deformity. All applications of HFCWO and BiPAP at NCKUH require approval from a pulmonologist and respiratory therapist following a comprehensive patient evaluation.

The medical device for HFCWO is COMFORTCOUGH ® II (Seoil Pacific Corp. South Korea). We configure the HFCWO device to “percussor” mode, setting the amplitude and frequency of percussion pressure based on patient comfort and clinical effectiveness. The amplitude of pressure was adjusted from 40 to 60 cmH 2 O and the frequency from 400 to 600 Hz, once or twice daily dependent on the availability of devices and respiratory therapists. The BiPAP device used is FlexoTM Bi-Level, set to “S/T” mode. The settings for inspiratory positive airway pressure (IPAP) and expiratory positive airway pressure (EPAP) are 8–15 cmH 2 O and 6–8 cmH 2 O, respectively. These settings aim to achieve a lung volume expansion targeted at 1.5 times the predicted tidal volume, which is calculated based on the predicted body weight (8–10 ml/kg of predicted body weight). The respiratory rate was set at 10–12 breaths per minute, with the inspiratory time set at approximately 33% of the single breathing cycle. Each setting was adjusted based on clinical effectiveness and patient comfort. BiPAP was administered contemporaneously with HFCWO, lasting about 30 min per session, once daily. For patients with significant sputum production, and when equipment and staff are available, BiPAP and HFCWO can be administered twice daily.

### Management of acutely decompensated chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension in late pregnancy: a case report [^ec588b60]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusions

Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension diagnosed during pregnancy carries considerable risk and requires adequate peripartum planning. Most common symptoms include dyspnea, hemoptysis, exercise intolerance and careful workup can identify hypoxia and hypotension. If suspected early, BNP levels higher than 300 pg/mL can identify patients at risk for heart failure, while echocardiography can verify the existence of pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular involvement.

In some rare cases though, the condition remains unnoticed until sudden and progressive worsening of cardiorespiratory parameters. Understandably, the diagnosis and treatment of previously unknown pulmonary hypertension presenting as acute right heart failure and respiratory failure in the late stage of pregnancy poses a difficult multidisciplinary management problem. Increased maternal mortality, risk of fetal growth and developmental delay, high-risk delivery and potential worsening of circulatory parameters in the postpartum period, all need to be considered when treating the patient. Several issues need to be addressed when establishing a peripartum management plan for a patient newly diagnosed with acute decompensation of previously undiagnosed pulmonary hypertension (Table 1).

Table 1 
Bullet points for peripartum management of acute decompensation of previously undiagnosed pulmonary hypertension

As there are no current clear recommendations regarding these issues, the ideal management needs to be established on a case by case basis, which is highlighted by our experience. Perioperative invasive cardiovascular monitoring is critical, but pulmonary arterial catheter use is discouraged in acute right heart failure due to high complication rates. Because of this, we opted to use PiCCO monitoring and regular echocardiography assessments. We hypothesized that regular measurement of cardiac index would be informative during the postpartum period when we expected hemodynamic instability. There are several factors that aid cardiovascular stability, crucial for both maternal and fetal outcome in the peripartum period. Improving oxygenation is important in reversing hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction, and normal oxygen saturation can ideally be achieved with high flow oxygen or low-pressure noninvasive ventilation. In our case we used BIPAP noninvasive ventilation with high FiO 2 : careful titration of pressures resulted in improved oxygenation while not compromising cardiovascular parameters.

### Evaluation and treatment of massive hemoptysis [^80f85fd5]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Massive hemoptysis is appropriately defined as life-threatening hemoptysis that causes airway obstruction, respiratory failure, and/or hypotension. Patients with this condition die from asphyxiation, not hemorrhagic shock. Any patient who presents with life-threatening hemoptysis requires immediate treatment to secure the airway and stabilize hemodynamics. Early activation and coordinated response from a multidisciplinary team is critical. Once the airway is secure and appropriate resuscitation is initiated, priorities are to localize the source of the bleeding and gain hemorrhage control. Nonsurgical control of hemorrhage is superior to surgery in the acute situation.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: a Report from the national asthma education and prevention program coordinating committee expert panel working group [^8b107bd6]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). Medium credibility.

Clinician’s Summary:

Most individuals aged 18 years and older with uncontrolled, moderate to severe, persistent asthma should not undergo BT to treat asthma because the benefits are small, the risks are moderate, and the long-term outcomes are uncertain. Some individuals with moderate to severe persistent asthma who have trouble some symptoms may be willing to accept the risks of BT and, therefore, might choose this intervention after shared decision making with their health care provider. Clinicians should offer the procedure in the setting of a clinical trial or a registry study to enable the collection of long-term data on the use of BT for asthma.

The Expert Panel does not recommend BT for individuals aged 18 years and older as part of routine asthma care, even if these individuals have uncontrolled asthma despite using multicomponent medical therapy, because of the small benefit-to-risk ratio. The risks of BT include asthma exacerbations, hemoptysis, and atelectasis during the treatment period. Recognizing, however, that BT is currently being used, the Expert Panel offers the following suggestions for its safe use:
BT should not be used in individuals with low lung function (FEV 1 that is <50% or 60% predicted) and life threatening asthma.
BT has not been studied in individuals younger than age 18 years.
In the opinion of the Expert Panel, when BT is implemented, it should be used in settings that enroll participants in registries, ongoing clinical trials, or studies that track BT’s long-term safety and effectiveness.
For individuals who decide to undergo BT, an experienced specialist (eg, a pulmonologist with training in BT administration) should provide this treatment in a center that has appropriate expertise.
Clinicians should optimize asthma treatment and address comorbidities, and they should assess and optimize adherence to existing therapy, before considering BT.
In some individuals, BT may provide a small benefit that might last 5 years or longer.
BT may reduce severe asthma exacerbations in comparison to standard care after treatment.
Risks associated with BT include worsening of asthma, respiratory infections, hemoptysis, bronchiectasis, and pulmonary artery complications. –
Severe latent or delayed-onset complications have not been reported with BT, but the number of individuals with asthma included in long-term follow-up assessments is very small (fewer than 250 people at the time the systematic review reporton this topic was completed).
What clinicians should discuss with their patients about BT: This procedure may reduce severe asthma exacerbations compared with standard care after treatment. Although the benefits could last 5 years or more, only limited data demonstrate that this treatment improves long-term asthma outcomes. The risks associated with BT include worsening of asthma, respiratory infections, hemoptysis, bronchiectasis, and pulmonary artery complications. – In addition, severe, delayed-onset complications could occur that have not yet been recognized because of the small numbers of individuals who have undergone the procedure. Individuals aged 18 years and older with persistent asthma who place a low value on the harms (short term worsening symptoms and unknown long-term side effects) and a high value on the potential benefits (improvement in asthma quality of life, small reduction in exacerbations) of BT might consider this treatment.

### Evidence-based guideline for prehospital airway management [^49435f28]. Prehospital Emergency Care (2024). High credibility.

CPAP/BiPAP continuation and discontinuation in prehospital care—once CPAP/BiPAP is initiated, breaking the mask seal may cause significant decrease in airway pressures and lead to abrupt decompensation due to atelectasis and alveolar collapse, and meticulous attention should be paid to maintaining mask seal unless hospital CPAP/BiPAP is immediately available for the patient to be switched over. In general, patients initiated on prehospital CPAP/BiPAP should remain on NIPPV, and discontinuation should only occur under the following settings: patients who demonstrate significant improvement, discontinuation may occur under either physician consultation or an established process, or if the patient deteriorates on CPAP/BiPAP (e.g., worsened mental status, increasing EtCO2, vomiting), discontinue CPAP/BiPAP and escalate airway management options as appropriate.

### The efficacy and safety of combined therapy with endobronchial tamponade and bronchial artery embolization for massive hemoptysis [^bfe77d6d]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, combination therapy appears to be more effective in improving respiratory function, correcting hypoxia, accelerating hemostasis, and reducing the recurrence rate of hemoptysis compared to embolization therapy alone. Therefore, combination therapy may be a preferable option for the treatment of massive hemoptysis and deserves wider clinical application.

### Anaesthetic management for endobronchial valve insertion: lessons learned from a single centre retrospective series and a literature review [^4314d602]. BMC Anesthesiology (2018). Low credibility.

Presently, it is unclear whether the type of anaesthetic technique has any role in precipitating pneumothorax. Although, there is a theoretical possibility of increased pneumothorax with positive pressure ventilation in these high risk patients especially with bullous lung disease, the risk may be reduced if a specific individually optimised ventilatory approach is adhered to. If High Frequency Jet Ventilation is available this may be an attractive option, however, we do not have this device in our institution. If a small pneumothorax does occur, − in the absence of tension - careful monitoring should suffice. A chest drain is indicated for larger pneumothoraces. Infections, COPD exacerbations, pneumonia and temporary haemoptysis are other possible postoperative complications.

Limitations of this review

### Symptom management in patients with lung cancer: diagnosis and management of lung cancer, 3rd ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^637e8738]. Chest (2013). Medium credibility.

Hemoptysis in lung cancer—Hemoptysis (expectoration of blood) is the presenting symptom in 7% to 10% of patients with lung cancer. Massive hemoptysis, which most commonly requires intervention, has as a broad definition the expectoration of at least 200 mL of blood in 24 h. The mortality rate of massive hemoptysis may be as high as 59% to 100% in patients with bronchogenic carcinoma. For patients with significant hemoptysis caused by a surgically resectable tumor, surgical resection of the bleeding lobe or the entire lung may be appropriate.

### An integrated approach to diagnosis and management of severe haemoptysis in patients admitted to the intensive care unit: a case series from a referral centre [^7cd5bd29]. Respiratory Research (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Haemoptysis may present as a life-threatening condition, with a mortality rate reaching 80% in the absence of adequate and prompt management [-]. The criteria used to characterize severe haemoptysis are heterogeneous and ill-defined. They are usually limited to the amount of blood expectorated within 24–48 hrs and its clinical consequences, or to the interventions used. A more 'functional' definition accounting for the respiratory reserve has also been proposed. Recent surveys suggest a shift from surgery to bronchial artery embolisation (BAE) as a first-line procedure in severe haemoptysis. Defining a better standardized management would be useful to physicians in charge of patients with severe haemoptysis to improve outcomes and should preferably take place in or nearby the intensive care unit (ICU).

In this study, we analyzed a large series of unselected patients with severe haemoptysis referred to a single respiratory intensive care unit with an affiliated intermediate care ward. Our objectives were to describe the characteristics of the patients managed using one of the three main initial therapeutic options (conservative measures, BAE or surgery) and to help better define the role of BAE, according to the severity of haemoptysis. The study was conducted in accordance with French law, which does not require approval of an IRB or the consent of patients for such retrospective analysis of medical records.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: a Report from the national asthma education and prevention program coordinating committee expert panel working group [^ec9a6d3e]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). High credibility.

Bronchial thermoplasty (BT) implementation and safety—expert panel guidance specifies that BT should not be used in individuals with low lung function (FEV1 that is <50% or 60% predicted) and life-threatening asthma, with ‘Life-threatening asthma’ defined as asthma that has resulted in hospitalization in an intensive care unit and/or has been treated with noninvasive ventilation or intubation in the past 5 years, and BT has not been studied in individuals younger than age 18 years. When BT is implemented, it should be used in settings that enroll participants in registries, ongoing clinical trials, or studies that track BT’s long-term safety and effectiveness, delivered by an experienced specialist in a center that has appropriate expertise, and clinicians should optimize asthma treatment and address comorbidities, and they should assess and optimize adherence to existing therapy, before considering BT. In some individuals, BT may provide a small benefit that might last 5 years or longer and BT may reduce severe asthma exacerbations in comparison to standard care after treatment, but severe latent or delayed-onset complications have not been reported and long-term follow-up cohorts are very small (fewer than 250 people). Counseling points include that this procedure may reduce severe asthma exacerbations and although the benefits could last 5 years or more, only limited data demonstrate that this treatment improves long-term asthma outcomes, and that the risks include worsening of asthma, respiratory infections, hemoptysis, bronchiectasis, and pulmonary artery complications, with the possibility that severe, delayed-onset complications could occur.

### CIRSE standards of practice on bronchial artery embolisation [^1e339451]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Grading of Haemoptysis

Although haemoptysis is a clearly defined symptom, there is still no consensus on the definition of SH. The threshold for defining SH varies between 200 and 1000 ml in 24–48 h. Others assess SH in terms of its respiratory and/or haemodynamic repercussions or use a scoring system.

Since the total volume of the conducting airways averages 150 ml in adults, any given haemorrhage in the airways can quickly become life-threatening.

Many still use a consensus definition that mild haemoptysis results in less than 100 ml/day or less than 50 ml/episode). Moderate haemoptysis (100–300 ml/day (≈ 1 cup)) can have a high mortality rate due to associated asphyxia and requires early treatment. In severely respiratory-compromised patients (FEV 1 < 35%), significant disturbances of the gas exchange, as well as suffocation, may occur with haemoptysis of far less than 300 ml.

Severe, LTH - may be defined as any haemoptysis that: (1) is > 100 ml in 24 h; (2) causes respiratory failure (SpO 2, < 60%) necessitating intubation and mechanical ventilation; or (3) causes haemodynamic instability. The cut-off volume of 100 ml per 24 h was selected because it is the smallest amount of haemoptysis that is reported in literature to threaten the life of the patient.

### Managing massive hemoptysis [^879d7b34]. Chest (2020). Medium credibility.

Massive hemoptysis is a medical emergency with high mortality presenting several difficult diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. The origin of bleeding and underlying etiology often is not immediately apparent, and techniques for management of this dangerous condition necessitate an expedient response. Unlike hemorrhage in other circumstances, a small amount of blood can rapidly flood the airways, thereby impairing oxygenation and ventilation, leading to asphyxia and consequent cardiovascular collapse. Of paramount importance is early control of the patient's airway and immediate isolation of hemorrhage in an attempt to localize and control bleeding. A coordinated team response is essential to guarantee the best chances of patient survival. Prompt control of the airway and steps to limit the spread of hemorrhage take precedence. Bronchial artery embolization, rigid and flexible bronchoscopy, and surgery all serve as potential treatment options to provide definitive control of hemorrhage. Several adjunctive therapies described in recent years may also assist in the control of bleeding; however, their role is less defined in life-threatening hemoptysis and warrants additional studies. In this concise review, we emphasize the steps necessary for a systematic approach in the management of life-threatening hemoptysis.

### Hemoptysis [^70973cd1]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Hemoptysis is a common complaint the emergency physician encounters. Most cases are minor and treatable or self-limited. In many cases a cause is never determined. Massive hemoptysis is an occasional occurrence that must be assessed and managed swiftly. The initial approach is no different than that for any bleeding or respiratory or hemodynamically unstable patient. The emergency physician must stabilize, localize, and stop bleeding, and include required specialists to achieve that purpose. The management suggestions presented in this article are simplistic. The emergence of improved CT technology and new bronchoscopic and angiographic techniques has provided safe and effective alternatives to surgery for many causes of hemoptysis. Surgery, however, continues to be the treatment of choice for some. Being familiar with the broad list of causes is imperative to keeping an approach organized.

### Bronchoscopy to assess patients with hemoptysis: which is the optimal timing? [^edaae546]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Our findings, based on a larger prospective and multicenter study, confirmed the results of Gong et al. In comparison with their findings, we detected a higher proportion of focal bleeding sites, probably owing to the higher prevalence of neoplasms (mostly endobronchial) in our cohort. Moreover, as observed by Gong et al. we could not detect active bleeding in the majority of the cases and we could not assess a better endoscopic ability in localizing bleeding sources associated with a very early evaluation.

Several study limitations should be acknowledged.

The observational nature of the study can increase the risk of a selection bias; however, the lack of evidence-based guidelines cannot support the design of an interventional, randomized control study for ethical reasons.

No guidelines exist on symptom severity. As previously reported, we grouped patients on the basis of their daily blood volume loss, without considering hemodynamic consequences and gas exchange impairment/airway obstruction [–,]. Life-threatening hemoptysis may depend on wide volume ranges of expectorated blood, as well as it may depend on other clinical variables (i.e. rate of bleeding, airways blood clearance, extent and severity of any underling lung and/or cardiac disease).

In case of life-threatening hemoptysis, airways patency should be immediately preserved; in this context, rigid bronchoscopy or tracheal intubation are better options in comparison with flexible bronchoscopy. Following ventilation recovery, flexible instrument may be used for diagnosis, localization of the bleeding source, and therapy.

We did not evaluate if different endoscopic timing might affect clinical management. This secondary analysis was aimed at the ideal timing of diagnostic endoscopy, without considering its role on long-term outcomes.

We demonstrated that bleeding source detection rate is higher in case of moderate-severe hemoptysis. It should be underscored that in critical cases of moderate-severe hemoptysis (i.e. life-threatening hemoptysis) bronchoscopy was always performed earlier if compared with cases of non-critical bleeding. This issue might have affected the findings of the study.

### Tracheotomy in ventilated patients with COVID-19 [^677b4e95]. Annals of Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

BACKGROUND

The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) global pandemic is characterized by rapid respiratory decompensation and subsequent need for endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation in severe cases. Approximately 3%–17% of hospitalized patients require invasive mechanical ventilation. – Current recommendations advocate for early intubation, with many also advocating the avoidance of non-invasive positive pressure ventilation such as high-flow nasal cannula, bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP), and bag-masking as they increase the risk of transmission through generation of aerosols. –

### Clinical approach to massive hemoptysis: perioperative focus on causes and management [^3f0ee71a]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2024). Medium credibility.

Massive hemoptysis is a time critical airway emergency in the perioperative setting, with an associated mortality exceeding 50%. Causes of hemoptysis in the perioperative setting include procedural complication, coagulopathy, malignancy, chronic lung disease, infection, left-sided cardiac disease, pulmonary vascular disease and autoimmune disease. A rapid and coordinated multidisciplinary response is required to secure the airway, isolate the lung, ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation, identify the underlying cause and initiate specific systemic, bronchoscopic, endovascular, or surgical treatment. This review examines the etiology, pathophysiology, as well as approach to management and interventions in perioperative massive hemoptysis.

### A clinical guide to non-invasive respiratory support in acute respiratory failure: ventilation settings, technical optimization and clinical indications [^74efcfdf]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Non-invasive respiratory support including high flow nasal therapy (HFNT), continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and Bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP), exerts distinct physiological effects and requires specific settings and technicalities. HFNT, delivered through dedicated nasal cannulas, provides low levels of positive airway pressure, anatomical dead space washout, allows good patient tolerance and can be used during CPAP or BiPAP breaks. CPAP and BiPAP, administered through various interfaces (e.g. facemasks, oro-nasal masks, or helmets), can deliver higher positive pressure, thereby increasing end-expiratory lung volume, reducing intrapulmonary shunt and oxygenation, with potential benefits on respiratory mechanics as well. BiPAP also delivers pressure support, aiding CO₂ clearance and respiratory muscle unloading, which is especially useful in hypercapnic respiratory failure. Increased intrathoracic pressure also reduces right ventricle preload and left ventricle afterload, which is beneficial in patients with impaired left ventricular function. Non-invasive respiratory support indications depend on the cause of acute respiratory failure. In hypercapnic respiratory failure with respiratory acidosis, BiPAP via facemask is strongly recommended to prevent intubation and reduce mortality. In cardiogenic pulmonary edema, either CPAP or BiPAP is recommended, while HFNT can be useful for patients requiring prolonged support or when CPAP/BiPAP is not tolerated even after ventilator and interface settings optimization. In de-novo acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, HFNT should be considered as the first-line treatment, regardless of the aetiology: however, in COVID-19-related AHRF CPAP can be considered to avoid intubation. The choice of non-invasive respiratory support interface in both cardiogenic and non-cardiogenic AHRF should aim at minimizing leaks, optimizing CO 2 clearance, and maximizing patient tolerance. Monitoring is essential during non-invasive respiratory support to assess patient’s response to treatment and to avoid delaying invasive respiratory support when needed, particularly in hypoxemic patients to avoid intubation delays and prevent patient-self-inflicted lung injury: physiological parameters, clinical scores, and lung ultrasound may help assess the risk of NIV failure. Monitoring tidal volume is valuable but challenging because of leaks. Though not widely used, esophageal pressure monitoring can assess patient effort and transpulmonary pressure. Additionally, electrical impedance tomography is an emerging tool for detecting asynchronous breathing and pendelluft phenomena.

### "Refined balloon pulmonary angioplasty" may need to be refined [^15228e8c]. JACC: Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

We would like to congratulate Bashir et alon their excellent work describing their experience with refined balloon pulmonary angioplasty (BPA) in chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. Utilizing pressure wire guidance and limiting distal mean pulmonary artery pressures to under 35 mmHg, low complication rates were reported with hemoptysis in 4.7% of BPA sessions and 2.6% of patients requiring intubation.

Prior studies reported higher complication rates, with hemoptysis in 5.6 to 14% of BPA sessions and intubation in 2.5 to 5.5% of patients. Other studies, which did not routinely use pressure wire guidance except during initial sessions, note a significant decrease as much as in half in complications rates over time. While Bashir et aldemonstrated fewer complications, the question remains: is the “refined BPA” technique integral to achieving lower complication rates?

At our center, pressure wire guidance is uncommon. We identify pressure gradients via a monorail, sensor-tipped micro pressure catheter to interrogate vessels if a question remains about the residual physiologic severity of a lesion. This method allows the operator to use typical workhorse wires which are more easily maneuvered and potentially more durable. The routine use of a pressure wire may increase procedure time, limit the number of vessels per session, and increase the number of sessions needed to achieve significant improvement. Through our institution’s initial 42 patients and 152 BPA sessions, hemoptysis occurred in 6.5%, and no patients required intubation. Based on this experience, it is these authors' opinion that the refined technique and routine use of pressure wire guidance may not be necessary to achieve lower complication rates.

As Bashir et alacknowledge, their cohort had less improvement in invasive hemodynamic parameters. While this may be due to incomplete BPA treatment course, patient population factors, or operator experience, it points toward an assumed balance point between hemodynamic response and risk of complications. Further study of BPA techniques will help to elucidate which factors may improve the safety and efficiency of this growing treatment option for chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension.

### A clinical guide to non-invasive respiratory support in acute respiratory failure: ventilation settings, technical optimization and clinical indications [^9d8c1ee0]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Cardiogenic pulmonary edema

In the context of CPE, several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) support the application of NIV (CPAP or BiPAP) to improve clinical outcomes (e.g. reduced need for endotracheal intubation, lower in-hospital mortality). NIV, in addition to pharmacologic interventions, is recommended as first-line therapy for patients with CPE without acute cardiogenic shock or need for revascularization therapy. In CPE, no NIV modality or interface has been shown to be superior ; therefore, the choice should prioritize minimizing leaks, ensuring CO 2 clearance, and optimizing patient tolerance. Even in patients with acidotic CPE, both CPAP and BiPAP reduced hypercapnia, acidosis and heart rate compared to COT (Table S1). Although the first RCT comparing CPAP and BiPAP raised concerns about a potential increased risk of acute myocardial infarction with BiPAP, several more recent trials have not confirmed this association.

In CPE patients, HFNT reduces respiratory rate more than COT and is non-inferior to face mask BiPAP for endotracheal intubation or death within 7 days. However, H-CPAP resulted in a greater short-term respiratory and hemodynamic improvement compared to HFNT. Therefore, HFNT may be beneficial for patients requiring prolonged support or those who do not tolerate CPAP or BiPAP.

Due to its simplicity, immediate efficacy, good tolerance and safety, CPAP, delivered via facemask, is feasible option in pre-hospital care, where it can be applied by minimally trained personnel. In the context of out-of-hospital CPE, CPAP, delivered via both facemask or helmet, has been shown to provide beneficial effects on respiratory and cardiac function.

### Cystic fibrosis pulmonary guidelines: pulmonary complications: hemoptysis and pneumothorax [^ed9c4be4]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2010). Medium credibility.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) pulmonary complications—hemoptysis and pneumothorax—are quantified with notable burden from lung disease, as 85% of the mortality results from lung disease. Hemoptysis is common, with a retrospective review reporting 9.1% of patients had hemoptysis in a 5-year period; massive bleeding also occurs, with approximately 4.1% of all patients with CF suffering massive hemoptysis during their lifetime, and an average annual incidence of 0.87%, or 1 in 115 patients per year. Pneumothorax risk is lower annually but clinically important, with an average annual incidence of 0.64%, or 1 in 167 patients per year, and approximately 3.4% of individuals with CF experiencing a pneumothorax during their lifetime; both complications occur more commonly in older patients with advanced disease.

### Hemoptysis: evaluation and management [^066aaf59]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Hemoptysis is the expectoration of blood from the lung parenchyma or airways. The initial step in the evaluation is determining the origin of bleeding. Pseudohemoptysis is identified through the history and physical examination. In adults, acute respiratory tract infections (e.g., bronchitis, pneumonia), bronchiectasis, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and malignancy are the most common causes. Tuberculosis is a major cause of hemoptysis in endemic regions of the world. Although tuberculosis rates are low in the United States, they are increased in persons who are homeless or who were born in other countries; consideration for testing should be made on an individual basis. Hemodynamic instability, abnormal gas exchange, cardiopulmonary comorbidities, and lesions at high risk of massive bleeding warrant inpatient evaluation. Chest radiography is recommended as the initial diagnostic test for hemodynamically stable patients with hemoptysis. Further evaluation with computed tomography with or without bronchoscopy is recommended in patients with massive hemoptysis, those with abnormal radiographic findings, and those with risk factors for malignancy despite normal radiographic findings.

### Randomised cross-over trial evaluating the short-term effects of non-invasive ventilation as an adjunct to airway clearance techniques in adults with cystic fibrosis [^7ff05915]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2019). High credibility.

Methods

Patient and public involvement

The research question stemmed from previously published research interviews completed with CF patient users of NIV for ACT,which on further discussion with these patients the authors felt was important to try and answer objectively. Patients with CF from the Royal Brompton Hospital were involved in designing the methodology to try and answer the question of whether sputum clearance changed with the addition of NIV. This same patient group made up the participants of this study, who were able to assess the burden of intervention themselves with the information provided prior to them giving written and informed consent. The results of the study were disseminated to participants via a letter.

Recruitment

Subjects were recruited from the adult CF centre at Royal Brompton Hospital, London. They were eligible to participate in the trial if they had a diagnosis of CF confirmed by standard criteria,were ≥16 years old, had been hospitalised for a pulmonary exacerbation which was resolving (by a clinician’s assessment), had been an inpatient for ≥7 days and had an established ACT regimen. Exclusion criteria included haemoptysis, pneumothorax, dependency on positive pressure support for ACT, history of spontaneous rib fracture, pregnancy, inability to give consent for participation, inclusion in another research study and requiring more than two supervised ACT sessions a day. Discontinuation criteria included voluntary withdrawal from the study, discharge from hospital prior to completion of the study or evidence of clinical deterioration during the study that required a change in medical treatment as determined by the CF medical team.

Written informed consent was gained prior to randomisation. Subjects were recruited between July 2013 and May 2017.

### The emergency department evaluation and management of massive hemoptysis [^4e9d61e6]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Massive hemoptysis is a life-threatening emergency that requires rapid evaluation and management. Recognition of this deadly condition, knowledge of the initial resuscitation and diagnostic evaluation, and communication with consultants capable of definitive management are key to successful treatment.

Objective

The objective of this narrative review is to provide an evidence-based review on the management of massive hemoptysis for the emergency clinician.

Discussion

Rapid diagnosis and management of life-threatening hemoptysis is key to patient survival. The majority of cases arise from the bronchial arterial system, which is under systemic blood pressure. Initial management includes patient and airway stabilization, reversal of coagulopathy, and identification of the source of bleeding using computed tomography angiogram. Bronchial artery embolization with interventional radiology has become the mainstay of treatment; however, unstable patients may require advanced bronchoscopic procedures to treat or temporize while additional information and treatment can be directed at the underlying pathology.

Conclusion

Massive hemoptysis is a life-threatening condition that emergency clinicians must be prepared to manage. Emergency clinicians should focus their management on immediate resuscitation, airway preservation often including intubation and isolation of the non-bleeding lung, and coordination of definitive management with available consultants including interventional radiology, interventional pulmonology, and thoracic surgery.

### Thirty-year prevalence of spontaneous hemoptysis in palliated single ventricle circulation [^587cbe90]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Our study has several limitations inherent with a single‐center retrospective study, including generalizability and potential loss to follow‐up underestimating the prevalence of hemoptysis. We rigorously screened for potential cases of hemoptysis through 2 independent queries; however, incomplete medical record documentation may underestimate episodes of hemoptysis. Low prevalence of hemoptysis in our cohort limited our ability to analyze potential risk factors for spontaneous hemoptysis or recurrence of hemoptysis. Multi‐institutional collaboration is needed to validate prevalence, identify patient‐specific risk factors, improve clinical counseling, and more fully inform clinical decision‐making.

### Evidence-based guideline for prehospital airway management [^b0a3c701]. Prehospital Emergency Care (2024). High credibility.

Prehospital airway management—non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV)—states that NIPPV should be considered early for severe ventilatory distress or impending respiratory failure of any etiology; options include continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP), bi-level nasal CPAP, purpose-built humidified, heated high-flow oxygen by nasal cannula, and assisted mask ventilation with positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP); in pediatric patients too small for CPAP masks, BVM with PEEP valve may augment breathing and offer non-invasive positive pressure ventilation; NIPPV can also be used to improve oxygenation pre-intubation and can be used in patients with altered mental status if closely attended and prepared to intervene as necessary.

### Hemoptysis: diagnosis and management [^a1d07f36]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Hemoptysis is the spitting of blood that originated in the lungs or bronchial tubes. The patient's history should help determine the amount of blood and differentiate between hemoptysis, pseudohemoptysis, and hematemesis. A focused physical examination can lead to the diagnosis in most cases. In children, lower respiratory tract infection and foreign body aspiration are common causes. In adults, bronchitis, bronchogenic carcinoma, and pneumonia are the major causes. Chest radiographs often aid in diagnosis and assist in using two complementary diagnostic procedures, fiberoptic bronchoscopy and high-resolution computed tomography, which are useful in difficult cases and when malignancy is suspected. The goals of management are threefold: bleeding cessation, aspiration prevention, and treatment of the underlying cause. Mild hemoptysis often is caused by an infection that can be managed on an outpatient basis with dose monitoring. If hemoptysis persists, consulting with a pulmonologist should be considered. Patients with risk factors for malignancy or recurrent hemoptysis also require further evaluation with fiberoptic bronchoscopy or high-resolution computed tomography. In up to 34 percent of patients, no cause of hemoptysis can be found.

### Non-invasive ventilation in acute respiratory failure: a randomised comparison of continuous positive airway pressure and bi-level positive airway pressure [^4c71df6c]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2003). Low credibility.

Objectives

To determine whether there is a difference in required duration of non-invasive ventilation between continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and bi-level positive airway pressure (BiPAP) in the treatment of a heterogeneous group of emergency department (ED) patients suffering acute respiratory failure and the subgroup of patients with acute pulmonary oedema (APO). Secondary objectives were to compare complications, failure rate, disposition, length of stay parameters, and mortality between the treatments.

Methods

This prospective randomised trial was conducted in the emergency departments of three Australian teaching hospitals. Patients in acute respiratory failure were randomly assigned to receive CPAP or BiPAP in addition to standard therapy. Duration of non-invasive ventilation, complications, failure rate, disposition, length of stay (hospital and ICU), and mortality were measured.

Results

101 patients were enrolled in the study (CPAP 51, BiPAP 50). The median duration of non-invasive ventilation with CPAP was 123 minutes (range 10-338) and 132 minutes (range 20-550) for BiPAP (p = 0.206, Mann-Whitney). For the subgroup suffering APO, 36 were randomised to CPAP and 35 to BiPAP. For this group the median duration of non-invasive ventilation for CPAP was 123 minutes (range 35-338) and 133 minutes (range 30-550) for BiPAP (p = 0.320, Mann-Whitney).

Conclusions

These results suggest that there is no significant difference in the duration of non-invasive ventilation treatment between CPAP and BiPAP when used for the treatment of acute respiratory failure in the ED. There was also no significant difference between the groups in secondary end points.

### Can fiberoptic bronchoscopy be applied to critically ill patients treated with noninvasive ventilation for acute respiratory distress syndrome? Prospective observational study [^08f684ca]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Noninvasive ventilation (NIV) is defined as any form of ventilatory support applied without endotracheal intubation. Application of NIV is a cornerstone for the treatment of acute respiratory failure of various etiologies. It reduces intubation rate in patients with exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema and in immunocompromised patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure. Using NIV is discussed in mild-to-moderate acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) patients (PaO 2 /FiO 2 > 150).

Fiberoptic bronchoscopy (FOB) may be required in some patients with acute respiratory failure in intensive care units (ICU), mainly as diagnostic tool or to remove abundant secretions. As a matter of fact it may also be applied to determine the cause of diffuse pulmonary infiltrates (infection, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, organizing pneumonia). Other indications for FOB in critically ill patients consist of atelectasis, hemoptysis and suspicion of lung neoplasia. Patients in ICU for acute respiratory failure often have comorbidities that increase the risk of bronchoscopy related complications. Feasibility of bronchoscopy during NIV in patients with respiratory failure was shown previously and NIV was found to be superior to conventional oxygen supplementation for preventing gas-exchange deterioration during FOB. In those studies, NIV was used to facilitate bronchoscopy and NIV was not required prior to bronchoscopy. However, there is limited data on the feasibility and usefulness of FOB in patients who are already treated with NIV for acute respiratory failure and in particular there is not enough evidence for using NIV in patients with ARDS. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the feasibility and safety of FOB in patients with ARDS ventilated with NIV and its contribution in the diagnosis and/or modification of the ongoing therapy.

### A comparison of continuous and bi-level positive airway pressure non-invasive ventilation in patients with acute cardiogenic pulmonary oedema: a meta-analysis [^afb7ab73]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

Results

We identified 17 potentially eligible studies, of which seven studies [,-], including a total of 290 patients, fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were subjected to meta-analysis (Figure 1). Two studies used fixed level of CPAP (10 cmH 2 O) and BiPAP (15 and 5 cmH 2 O), two studies used a fixed level of CPAP (10 cmH 2 O) but titrated the level of peak inspiratory pressure in the BiPAP group (from 15 cmH 2 O to achieve a tidal volume of 400 ml), and three studies titrated the level of both CPAP (5–20 cmH 2 O) and BiPAP (peak inspiratory pressure range: 10–25 cmH 2 O). Four studies [,-] recruited patients who presented with hypercapnia (mean PaCO 2 >45 mmHg). The mean age of the patients ranged from 61 to 77 years and the mean Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II scores ranged from 17 to 20 in the pooled studies. The Jadad scale scores of the studies ranged from 2 to 5 (mean 3). Allocation concealment was clearly adequate in four studies but only one study used double blinding. The study details are described in Table 1.

There was good overall consistency in most of the results, without significant heterogeneity. Hospital mortality (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.32–1.78; P = 0.52; I 2 = 0%) and the risk for requiring invasive ventilation (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.33–1.94; P = 0.62; I 2 = 0%) were not significantly different between patients treated with CPAP and those treated with BiPAP (Figures 2 and 3). Stratifying studies into use of BiPAP at variable or fixed level of airway pressure did not change the results. The relative risk ratios for hospital mortality and requiring invasive ventilation between studies using BiPAP at a fixed level and studies titrating the pressure were 3.38 (95% CI 0.30–37.60; P = 0.32) and 1.26 (95% CI 0.15–10.94; P = 0.83), respectively. Sensitivity analysis including studies that involved patients with significant hypercapnia did not change the results.

### Safety and clinical findings of BiPAP utilization in children 20 kg or less for asthma exacerbations [^a2fb818f]. Intensive Care Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose

To investigate safety and clinical findings of bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) utilization in children 20 kg or less for asthma exacerbations.

Methods

Retrospective and prospective descriptive analysis of 165 enrolled subjects with moderate and severe asthma exacerbations who weighed 20 kg or less and who received BiPAP treatment at a large, urban children's hospital pediatric emergency department (PED).

Results

Age was 0.6-8.27 years (mean 3.7 years, SD 1.6 years). None exhibited worsening hypoxia, pneumothorax, or death. Four progressed to intubation after significant period on BiPAP. Overall, BiPAP subjects showed improvement in pediatric asthma score (PAS). BiPAP initiation PAS range was 8-15 (mean 12.1, SD 1.6); BiPAP termination or 4 h PAS mean was 6.3 (SD 2.2); delta PAS showed improvement mean 5.8 (SD 2.4). Seventy-one had trial off BiPAP in PED for clinical improvement; seven were restarted. PED BiPAP duration range was 30-720 min (mean 210 min, SD 158 min); total hospitalization BiPAP duration was 1-90 h. Ninety-nine (60%) subjects were admitted to the PICU and continued BiPAP for 0-47 h (mean 6.6 h, SD 8.6 h). Fifty-seven (35%) required ward admission; none were transferred to PICU. Nine (5%) were discharged home from the PED; none returned within 72 h.

Conclusions

BiPAP utilization in acute pediatric asthma exacerbations for patients 20 kg or less is safe and may improve clinical outcomes. These findings warrant future prospective investigation of BiPAP efficacy in pediatric asthma patients.

### A comparison of bilevel and continuous positive airway pressure noninvasive ventilation in acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema [^c64670ff]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Whether bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) is advantageous compared with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) in acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema (ACPO) remains uncertain. The aim of the meta-analysis was to assess potential beneficial and adverse effects of CPAP compared with BiPAP in patients with ACPO.

Methods

Randomized controlled trials comparing the treatment effects of BiPAP with CPAP were identified from electronic databases and reference lists from January 1966 to December 2012. Two reviewers independently assessed study quality. In trials that fulfilled inclusion criteria, we critically evaluate the evidence for the use of noninvasive ventilation on rates of hospital mortality, endotracheal intubation, myocardial infarction, and the length of hospital stay. Data were combined using Review Manager 4.3 (The Cochrane Collaboration, Oxford, UK). Both pooled effects and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated.

Results

Twelve randomized controlled trials with a total of 1433 patients with ACPO were included. The hospital mortality (relative risk [RR], 0.86; 95% CI, 0.65-1.14; P = .46; I(2) = 0%) and need for requiring invasive ventilation (RR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.57-1.38; P = .64; I(2) = 0%) were not significantly different between patients treated with CPAP and those treated with BiPAP. The occurrence of new cases of myocardial infarction (RR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.77-1.17; P = .53, I(2) = 0%) and length of hospital stay (RR, 1.01; 95% CI, -0.40 to 2.41; P = .98; I(2) = 0%) were also not significantly different between the 2 groups.

Conclusions

There are no significant differences in clinical outcomes when comparing CPAP vs BiPAP. Based on the limited data available, our results suggest that there are no significant differences in clinical outcomes when comparing CPAP with BiPAP.

### Hemoptysis, a developing world perspective [^048a7363]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Hemoptysis refers to expectoration of blood from respiratory tract. Often lethal, it is a frightening presentation for patient and relatives. A major emergency in pulmonary medicine, it necessitates a timely and apt approach.

While emergency resuscitation protocols may overlap, medical advance is usually directed on basis of severity and etiology of hemoptysis. Apposite clinical assessment and investigations are thus paramount in formulating the management proposal. After adequate airway protection and insurance of ventilatory and cardiovascular stability, in case of gross hemoptysis, imaging is usually resorted to, for indication of the pathology and localization of bleeding site. Chest roentgenography is frequently valuable in illustrating the disease process. Computed tomography has also been established in recent decades as a particularly sensitive diagnostic and localizing tool in hemoptysis. Endoscopic assessment, however, by rigid and/or flexible bronchoscopy is often warranted. Both a diagnostic and therapeutic tool, it is aimed to lateralize the bleeding side; localize the bleeding site and identify the cause. In case of rapid and severe hemorrhage making airway visualization impossible, emergent rigid bronchoscopy or arteriography may be employed, for successful isolation and subsequent clogging of the bleeding vessel.

Management approach is prioritized to control ongoing hemoptysis with endotracheal intubation and intensive care monitoring. In cases with lateralized or localized persistent bleeding immediate, albeit transient, control of the airway may be obtained with topical therapy, endobronchial tamponade, or unilateral intubation of the nonbleeding lung. Angioembolization of the pathologic bleeding bronchial arterial vessels is now globally recommended as the treatment of choice in most cases. Apart from being a definitive treatment modality, it provides valuable time and prevents bleeding during operation in patients undergoing subsequent surgical intervention. Conservative management is generally preferred and associated with lesser mortality rates. Surgery is usually advocated in case of failure of embolotherapy, persistent hemodynamic and respiratory compromise and accurate identification of the bleeding site. Lobectomy, pneumectomy, wedge resection, segmentectomy or a combination of these approaches may be adapted. Emergent resection, however, is associated with greater risks in comparison to elective surgery, and should generally be reserved for when general condition and vital organs of the patient would permit surgical therapy.

### Mannitol (Bronchitol) [^8e0e2941]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.1 Bronchospasm

BRONCHITOL Tolerance Test 

BRONCHITOL can cause bronchospasm, which can be severe in susceptible individuals. Because of the risk of bronchospasm, prior to prescribing BRONCHITOL, perform the BRONCHITOL Tolerance Test (BTT), to identify patients who are appropriate for maintenance treatment with BRONCHITOL. The BTT must be administered under the supervision of a healthcare practitioner who can treat severe bronchospasm. In clinical trials, 896 adult patients with cystic fibrosis underwent the BTT and 72 patients (8%) failed or did not complete the BTT. Do not prescribe BRONCHITOL if the patient fails the BTT.

Maintenance Therapy 

Bronchospasm may occur during inhalation of BRONCHITOL, even in patients who have passed the BTT. An inhaled short-acting bronchodilator must be administered 5-15 minutes before administration of each dose during maintenance therapy. In clinical studies, bronchospasm or bronchial hyperreactivity was reported in 4 of 414 adult patients (1.0%) receiving BRONCHITOL as maintenance therapy and in 2 of 347 adult patients (0.6%) receiving control (50 mg inhaled mannitol), even though these patients had passed the BTT. If bronchospasm occurs following dosing of BRONCHITOL, it should immediately be discontinued and treated with an inhaled short-acting bronchodilator or as medically appropriate.

5.2 Hemoptysis

Hemoptysis may occur with BRONCHITOL use. Hemoptysis was reported in 43 (10.4%) adult patients receiving BRONCHITOL and in 33 (9.5%) adult patients receiving control (50 mg inhaled mannitol) during clinical studies. In patients aged 6 years to 17 years, hemoptysis was reported in 12 of 154 (7.8%) patients who received BRONCHITOL and in 2 of 105 (1.9%) patients who received control. BRONCHITOL has not been studied in patients with a history of episodes of significant hemoptysis (volume greater than 60 mL) in the previous 3 months. BRONCHITOL should be discontinued in the event of hemoptysis. BRONCHITOL is not indicated for use in children and adolescents.

### Swimming-induced pulmonary edema: evaluation of prehospital treatment with CPAP or positive expiratory pressure device [^35e1a875]. Chest (2022). Medium credibility.

Take-home Points

Study Question: Is noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) a feasible and safe prehospital treatment for swimming-induced pulmonary edema?

Results: Most patients (91%) could be discharged safely after a median of 10 to 20 min of NPPV treatment on site.

Interpretation: NPPV, administered as CPAP ventilation or by a positive expiratory pressure device, proved feasible and safe as prehospital treatment for swimming-induced pulmonary edema.

FOR EDITORIAL COMMENT, SEE

Swimming-induced pulmonary edema (SIPE) occurs in predominantly healthy individuals during swimming in cold open water.Symptoms consist of dyspnea, cough, or hemoptysis together with hypoxemia and findings of crackles on pulmonary auscultation. Pulmonary edema in patients with SIPE has been visualized by radiograph or CT scan, but also been confirmed in prehospital settings by point-of-care lung ultrasound (LUS).Although the pathophysiologic features are not understood fully, SIPE is considered a hydrostatic edema with high pulmonary capillary transmural pressure. The proposed mechanism is a combination of central pooling of blood and increased left ventricular afterload resulting from immersion in cold water, increased pulmonary capillary pressure during physical exercise, and negative intrathoracic pressures during head-out water immersion in susceptible individuals.,,Consequently, SIPE usually resolves spontaneously within 24 to 48 h after removal of the patient from water and rest, but occasionally may be life-threatening. The optimal strategy for treatment of SIPE is unknown. Based on pathophysiologic characteristics, noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) could be a favorable treatment. Interestingly, other than a pilot study published by our research group in 2016, we could find only seven cases of patients treated with NPPV for SIPE in the literature.,,,,

### High risk and low incidence diseases: massive hemoptysis [^005a6979]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Massive hemoptysis (MH) is a serious condition that carries with it a high rate of morbidity and mortality.

Objective

This review highlights the pearls and pitfalls of massive hemoptysis, including presentation, diagnosis, and management in the emergency department (ED) based on current evidence.

Discussion

MH is a rare but deadly condition. It is defined clinically as any bleeding from the tracheobronchial tree that compromises respiratory or circulatory function. The bronchial artery system is the primary source in the majority of cases of MH. The most common cause is tuberculosis worldwide, but bronchiectasis, bronchogenic carcinoma, and mycetoma are more common causes in the U.S. Patients with MH require rapid assessment and management, as decompensation can be rapid. Patients with altered mental status, inability to clear their sections, respiratory distress, or hemodynamic compromise require emergent airway intervention. The imaging modality of choice is computed tomography angiography with pulmonary arterial phase contrast. A reasonable order or sequence of management includes initial stabilization; assessment for the need for airway intervention; reversal of any coagulopathy; advanced imaging; and emergent consultation of pulmonary, cardiothoracic surgery, and interventional radiology. Ongoing resuscitation including blood products may be required in some patients with MH until definitive hemostasis is achieved.

Conclusions

An understanding of MH can assist emergency clinicians in diagnosing and managing this dangerous disease. Providing a prompt evaluation, obtaining intravenous access, pursuing advanced imaging, providing reversal of coagulopathy, supporting hemodynamics, and appropriate consultation are key interventions in MH.

### A comparison of continuous and bi-level positive airway pressure non-invasive ventilation in patients with acute cardiogenic pulmonary oedema: a meta-analysis [^c126966b]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

Two independent reviewers examined the titles and the abstracts of all identified trials to confirm that they fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The same reviewers examined and recorded the trial characteristics and outcomes independently, using a pre-designed data abstraction form. This abstraction form was used to record information regarding the quality of the trial, such as allocation concealment, randomization method, blinding of treatment, and inclusion and exclusion criteria. The quality of the study was scored according to the Jadad scale (range from 0 to 5, with higher scores indicating better quality), but the individual component that constitutes the quality of the study was also described. The grading of allocation concealment was based on the Cochrane approach (i.e. adequate or uncertain or clearly inadequate). Blinding of the attending physician who decided when to initiate invasive ventilation or to cease noninvasive ventilation with the assigned mode of noninvasive ventilation (for instance CPAP or BiPAP) was required for a study to qualify as double blind. Any disagreements between the two independent reviewers were resolved by consensus. Data were checked and entered into the Review Manager (version 4.2.6 for Windows, 2003; The Cochrane Collaboration, Oxford, UK) database for further analysis.

The hospital mortality and the proportion of patients requiring invasive ventilation (or intubation) were chosen as main outcomes of this meta-analysis because they are the most relevant clinical outcomes of noninvasive ventilation in patients with acute cardiogenic pulmonary oedema. The criteria for requiring invasive ventilation varied between studies, but the common criteria included poor state of consciousness (Glasgow Coma Scale score ≤ 13), respiratory arrest or significant respiratory distress (respiratory rate >40 breaths/minute), persistent hypoxaemia despite supplementary oxygen (arterial oxygen tension <60 mmHg) and progressive increases in PaCO 2 despite CPAP or BiPAP treatment (>5 mmHg). The other outcomes assessed in the meta-analysis included the proportion of patients who developed new onset acute myocardial infarction after initiation of BiPAP or CPAP, duration of noninvasive ventilation needed till the pulmonary oedema resolved, and length of hospital stay. The criteria and process of weaning from CPAP or BiPAP varied between studies, but the common criteria included absence of respiratory distress with respiratory rate below 25 breaths/minute and pulse oximetry saturation of 95% or greater. The weaning process usually involved stepwise reduction in inspiratory and expiratory pressures (2 cmH 2 O) and inspired oxygen concentration (10%).

### Clinical and organizational factors in the initial evaluation of patients with lung cancer: diagnosis and management of lung cancer, 3rd ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^5c6ebd7f]. Chest (2013). Medium credibility.

Lung cancer presenting symptoms and diagnostic cues—cough is the most common presentation and may result from endobronchial irritation, parenchymal infiltration, or postobstructive pneumonia. Recurrent pneumonia in the same anatomic distribution or relapsing acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) should raise concern for neoplasm. Localized or unilateral wheezing may reflect endobronchial obstruction, and pleuritic chest pain should raise concern for invasion of the pleura. Hemoptysis accompanying lung cancer is rarely massive, and hemoptysis may be the presenting symptom of lung cancer even in the setting of a normal or nonlocalizing chest radiograph. Persistent hemoptysis, even in scant amounts, in patients with a history of smoking and COPD should raise concern about the possibility of endobronchial tumor.

### High flow biphasic positive airway pressure by helmet – effects on pressurization, tidal volume, carbon dioxide accumulation and noise exposure [^94909c32]. Critical Care (2009). Low credibility.

Conclusions

This study demonstrates a new concept of time-cycled biphasic airway pressure with a high flow system in a lung model. This approach might resolve some of the problems seen with the helmet interface and broaden the indications for its use. With HF-BiPAP, CO 2 removal from the helmet was highly efficient regardless of the underlying lung pathology. Pressurization of the helmet seems particularly efficient at the lower levels of assistance. If the patient requires a high level of assistance one has to be aware of the increased pressurization during expiration, which might be beneficial but also increases the load during expiration.

### The efficacy and safety of combined therapy with endobronchial tamponade and bronchial artery embolization for massive hemoptysis [^f85d2334]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Massive hemoptysis is characterized by its life-threatening nature, potentially leading to airway obstruction and asphyxia. In the literature, massive hemoptysis has been defined as bleeding ranging from 100 to 1000 ml over a 24-hour period, although the range of 300–600 ml is more commonly recognized. Accurately estimating the volume of hemoptysis is challenging, so the impact of respiratory distress or hypoxia on the patient is often more crucial. While there are various causes, the primary etiologies are bronchiectasis, necrotizing pneumonia, cancer, and tuberculosis (TB). Massive hemoptysis is associated with a high mortality rate, emphasizing the need for prompt diagnosis and treatment to prevent catastrophic consequences.

Since its introduction by Remy et al. in 1973, bronchial artery embolization (BAE) has become a well-established, safe, and effective first-line therapy for severe hemoptysis. As a minimally invasive procedure, it boasts a high technical and clinical success rate with minimal complications. However, one disadvantage is the high recurrence rate. Recently, bronchoscopic interventions have been widely applied in the management of massive hemoptysis, demonstrating a high success rate. The primary goal of bronchoscopic intervention treatment is to clear blood and secretions, maintain an unobstructed airway, prevent asphyxia, and achieve local hemostasis. Although bronchoscopy for massive hemoptysis carries the risk of exacerbating bleeding, it remains an effective diagnostic and therapeutic measure when necessary. Among bronchoscopic interventions, endobronchial tamponade with balloons or stents has been well-documented in case reports as an effective method for managing massive hemoptysis. Currently, endobronchial tamponade is typically used as an interim therapy and removed within a short period, setting the stage for subsequent treatment. BAE and endobronchial occlusion have both demonstrated effectiveness in managing massive hemoptysis. However, the detailed report on the efficacy of combination therapy has not been extensively studied. Therefore, the objective of this study is to investigate the safety and clinical efficacy of combined BAE and endobronchial tamponade therapy, providing valuable guidance for treatment selection.

### Systematic review and meta-analysis of efficacy and safety of continuous positive airways pressure versus high flow oxygen cannula in acute bronchiolitis [^4fce743e]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Discusion

Our review found that there are not differences between CPAP and HFNC in the risk of mechanical ventilation and mortality. CPAP was associated with less risk of treatment failure but with higher adverse events than HFNC. Overall, the certainty of evidence was low because of the small number of trials and variability of methodology among studies.

This results are consistent with recenty evidence of CPAP and HFNC in acute lower respiratoy infection in children. Wang in a systematic review and bayesian network meta-analysis found that, compared with standard oxygen therapy, CPAP was associated with a lower risk of intubation (OR: 0.40, 95% CrI: 0.16–0.90). But there were no significant differences between these tretments in intubation rate, and in-hospital mortality. In the indirect comparisons,for intubation rate, the SUCRA for BIPAP, CPAP,HFNC, and, standard oxygen therapy (SOT) were 88.1, 73.0, 28.7, and 10.2%, respectively.

### Mannitol (aridol bronchial challenge test kit) [^4329aa5d]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5 WARNINGS & PRECAUTIONS

Severe bronchospasm: ARIDOL may cause severe bronchospasm in susceptible patients. Administer by trained professionals under the supervision of a physician. Medications and equipment to treat severe bronchospasm must be present in the testing area. (5.1)
Subjects with co-morbid conditions: Use with caution in patients with conditions that may increase sensitivity to the bronchoconstricting or other potential effects of ARIDOL such as: severe cough, ventilatory impairment, unstable angina, or active upper or lower respiratory tract infection that may worsen with use of a bronchial irritant. (5.2)

5.1 Severe Bronchospasm

Mannitol, the active ingredient in ARIDOL, acts as a bronchoconstrictor and may cause severe bronchospasm in susceptible patients. The test should only be conducted by trained professionals under the supervision of a physician familiar with all aspects of the bronchial challenge test and the management of acute bronchospasm. Patients should not be left unattended during the bronchial challenge test. Medications and equipment to treat severe bronchospasm must be present in the testing area.

If a patient has a ≥10% reduction in FEV1(from pre-challenge FEV1) on administration of the 0 mg capsule, the ARIDOL Bronchial Challenge Test should be discontinued and the patient should be given a dose of a short-acting inhaled beta-agonist and monitored accordingly.

Patients with either a positive response to bronchial challenge testing with ARIDOL or significant respiratory symptoms should receive a short-acting inhaled beta-agonist. Patients should be monitored until fully recovered to within baseline.

5.2 Subjects with Co-morbid Conditions

Bronchial challenge testing with ARIDOL should be performed with caution in patients with conditions that may increase sensitivity to the bronchoconstricting or other potential effects of ARIDOL such as severe cough, ventilatory impairment, spirometry-induced bronchoconstriction, hemoptysis of unknown origin, pneumothorax, recent abdominal or thoracic surgery, recent intraocular surgery, unstable angina, or active upper or lower respiratory tract infection.

### CPAP or BiPAP for motion mitigation during radiotherapy (SISTER) [^7e0350d6]. ClinicalTrials (2021). Medium credibility.

CPAP or BiPAP for Motion Mitigation During Radiotherapy ClinicalTrials. gov ID. Study Overview When using highly conformal radiotherapy techniques, such as proton therapy, a controlled breathing pattern and a minimal breathing amplitude could greatly benefit the treatment of mobile tumors. This reduction in tumor motion may be achieved with the use of a ventilator that is able to regulate and modulate the breathing pattern. CPAP provides a constant level of positive airway pressure. Compared to spontaneous breathing, the use of CPAP increased lung volume and can result in a significant decrease in tumor movement and a significant decrease in both mean lung and mean heart radiation dose. These results were found in patients treated for limited stage disease, it is not clear if this approach is feasible for patients with more advanced stage of disease that undergo radiotherapy with curative intent.

With Bilevel Positive Airway Pressure, tidal volume excursions are determined by the pressure difference between the set inspiratory positive airway pressure and the set expiratory positive airway pressure. This mode of ventilation increases lung volume comparable to CPAP, but also to control tidal volumes and breathing frequency. However, BiPAP has never been studied in the setting of motion mitigation during radiotherapy and BiPAP might be more difficult to adjust to for patients compared to CPAP. Therefore, the current study is proposed to evaluate whether or not CPAP or BiPAP is of benefit in patients that undergo radiotherapy for larger intra-thoracic tumor volumes. The study will follow a 2-step approach. First, the feasibility of short-term use of CPAP and BiPAP and its effects on lung volumes, tidal volumes and breathing frequency will be investigated in patients with intra-thoracic tumors who are planned for radiotherapy.

This is necessary to select the best setting of CPAP or BiPAP with which minimal tumor motion is expected. In the second phase, the particular setting found in fase 1 is investigated: weekly repeated radiotherapy planning CT scans with and without CPAP/BiPAP will be aquired to evaluate the influence on tumor motion and dose to the target and organs at risk. Radiotherapy will be deliverd according to local protocol without the use of CPAP/BiPAP. Device: CPAP

Respiratory—patient safety considerations during airway management: Suctioning to limit aspiration is a priority, and clinicians should avoid excessive pressures or tidal volumes during BVM ventilation with the goal to avoid barotrauma as well as overventilation and related reduction of venous return/preload/cardiac output. Routine use of sedation is not recommended for treatment of anxiety in patients on NIV. Endotracheal intubation should only be used if less invasive methods do not meet patient care goals, and once a successful SGA placement or intubation has been performed, obstruction or displacement can have negative effects and tubes should be secured with either a commercial tube holder or tape. Meticulous attention should be paid to avoiding hypoxia and hypotension during intubation attempts, and waveform capnography should be placed prior to the first breath through an invasive airway to confirm placement. Drug Assisted Airway Management (DAAM) should be reserved for specialized clinicians within a comprehensive program with adequate resources, ongoing training and quality assurance measures, and close EMS physician oversight. Once CPAP/BiPAP is initiated and tolerated, DO NOT discontinue it until the patient is on the emergency department stretcher with hospital CPAP/BiPAP immediately available or a physician requests discontinuation, and breaking the mask seal can cause a significant decrease in airway pressures and abrupt decompensation due to atelectasis and alveolar collapse. If the patient deteriorates on CPAP/BiPAP, remove CPAP/BiPAP and escalate airway management options as above, and if an endotracheal tube becomes dislodged, SGA should be strongly considered.

### Days spent on non-invasive ventilation support: can it determine when to initiate VV-ECMO? Observational study in a cohort of COVID-19 patients [^78ba17d4]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The number of days spent on mechanical ventilation before interventions, such as venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO) or steroids, has been used to classify different clinical stages of the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). This classification tries to differentiate between an early phase, most of the times defined within the first week from endotracheal intubation (ETI) when interventions could potentially change the ARDS evolution, and a late phase, normally more than seven days from ETI when interventions would theoretically be ineffective. This classification, where day 0 is defined by the day of ETI, represents a somewhat historic cohort given that in the past most of the patients with hypoxemic acute respiratory failure (ARF) were not treated with any form of non-invasive ventilation (NIV) prior to ETI.

During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the use of NIV for hypoxemic ARF extraordinarily increased, initially due to logistical reasons, but soon after it became a more standard practice with observational reports showing that this NIV approach could be associated with a decrease in mortality (although study designs do not allow inferring causality) especially when compared to that of an early intubation approach. NIV in whatever form it be, high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC), continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), or bi-level positive airway pressure (BiPAP), probably heralds the initial stage of alveolar collapse of ARDS where positive pressure is required to maintain adequate oxygenation. HFNC can be included as a NIV modality but important differences exist in the level of positive pressure that can provide support to reduce the work of breathing and improve oxygenation. Furthermore, important concerns still exist respect to the effect that these pressures may have in the lung specially regarding the patient’s self-inflicted lung injury (P-SILI) hypothesis although no solid scientific data has demonstrated so far that invasive ventilation would be less harmful than NIV, especially when high PEEP is required or recruitment manoeuvres are performed.

### A comparison of continuous and bi-level positive airway pressure non-invasive ventilation in patients with acute cardiogenic pulmonary oedema: a meta-analysis [^47e441ae]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

Introduction

We conducted the present study to investigate the potential beneficial and adverse effects of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) compared with bi-level positive airway pressure (BiPAP) noninvasive ventilation in patients with cardiogenic pulmonary oedema.

Method

We included randomized controlled studies comparing CPAP and BiPAP treatment in patients with cardiogenic pulmonary oedema from the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (2005 issue 3), and EMBASE and MEDLINE databases (1966 to 1 December 2005), without language restriction. Two reviewers reviewed the quality of the studies and independently performed data extraction.

Results

Seven randomized controlled studies, including a total of 290 patients with cardiogenic pulmonary oedema, were considered. The hospital mortality (relative risk [RR] 0.76, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.32-1.78; P = 0.52; I2 = 0%) and risk for requiring invasive ventilation (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.33-1.94; P = 0.62; I2 = 0%) were not significantly different between patients treated with CPAP and those treated with BiPAP. Stratifying studies that used either fixed or titrated pressure during BiPAP treatment and studies involving patients with or without hypercapnia did not change the results. The duration of noninvasive ventilation required until the pulmonary oedema resolved (weighted mean difference [WMD] in hours = 3.65, 95% CI -12.12 to +19.43; P = 0.65, I2 = 0%) and length of hospital stay (WMD in days = -0.04, 95% CI -2.57 to +2.48; P = 0.97, I2 = 0%) were also not significantly different between the two groups. Based on the limited data available, there was an insignificant trend toward an increase in new onset acute myocardial infarction in patients treated with BiPAP (RR 2.10, 95% CI 0.91-4.84; P = 0.08; I2 = 25.3%).

Conclusion

BiPAP does not offer any significant clinical benefits over CPAP in patients with acute cardiogenic pulmonary oedema. Until a large randomized controlled trial shows significant clinical benefit and cost-effectiveness of BiPAP versus CPAP in patients with acute cardiogenic pulmonary oedema, the choice of modality will depend mainly on the equipment available.

### A national model for developing, implementing, and evaluating evidence-based guidelines for prehospital care [^0e8e4d83]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

Tracheostomy management—patient safety considerations and cuff use state that cuff may need to be inflated to provide adequate oxygenation and ventilation when positive pressure ventilation is required, but cuff should never be inflated if positive pressure ventilation is not being performed, or in patients with a Passy-Muir (teal colored) speaking valve in place. Especially in pediatric tracheostomy patients with significant respiratory distress, plugging or dislodgement of the tracheostomy is the problem until proven otherwise, and signs and symptoms including respiratory distress, cyanosis, ventilator alarms, decreased level of consciousness, decreased SpO2 or cardiac arrest, as well as bradycardia in pediatric tracheostomy patients should be presumed due to a tracheostomy obstruction. Laryngectomy patients and some patients with congenital or surgical airway abnormalities cannot be orally intubated, whereas patients with tracheostomy alone (e.g., for mechanical ventilation) and no airway abnormalities should be able to be orally intubated. For recent tracheostomy patients who present with bleeding in the early (up to 3 weeks) postoperative period, a tracheoinnominate arterial bleed is an uncommon and life-threatening complication (0.7% incidence and a 90% mortality rate), and 50% of these patients present initially with a smaller sentinel bleed/hemoptysis which appears to have stopped. Inflation of the tracheostomy balloon to the maximum is a potential temporizing measure until definitive care can be provided, even overinflation may be needed, and any patient in the early postoperative period (within a month of surgery) with hemoptysis or bleeding from a tracheostomy should be transported for evaluation, even if bleeding has stopped. Prompt tracheostomy replacement is important, because delays allow for narrowing of the stoma and can make recannulation more difficult.

Possible PARDS and At Risk for PARDS

Definition statement 1.5.1. Patients on a nasal interface of NIV (CPAP or BiPAP) or on HFNC greater than or equal to 1.5 L/kg/min or greater than or equal to 30 L/min should be considered as having possible PARDS if they meet timing, oxygenation, etiology/risk factor, and imaging criteria (Ungraded DS, 87% agreement).

Definition statement 1.5.2. Patients who are missing imaging due to resource limitations should be considered as having possible PARDS if they otherwise meet timing, oxygenation, and risk factor criteria. (Ungraded DS, 90% agreement).

Definition statement 1.5.3. Defining a group of patients at risk for PARDS is necessary to determine the epidemiology of disease progression and potential avenues for disease prevention. (Ungraded DS, 96% agreement).

Diagnosing PARDS in Patients With Chronic Cardiorespiratory Disease

Definition statement 1.6.1. Patients with cyanotic congenital heart disease are considered to have PARDS if they fulfill standard PARDS criteria and have an acute deterioration in oxygenation (relative to baseline) not fully explained by the underlying cardiac disease. (Ungraded DS, 98% agreement).

Definition statement 1.6.2. Patients with left ventricular (LV) dysfunction who fulfill standard PARDS criteria are considered to have PARDS if acute hypoxemia and new chest imaging changes cannot be explained solely by LV heart failure or fluid overload. (Ungraded DS, 92% agreement).

Remarks: Cardiac ultrasonography and/or left atrial pressure may be useful in identifying hydrostatic pulmonary edema.

Definition statement 1.6.3. Patients with preexisting chronic lung disease treated with supplemental oxygen, NIV, or IMV via tracheostomy are considered to have PARDS if they demonstrate acute changes that fulfill standard PARDS criteria and exhibit an acute deterioration in oxygenation from baseline that meets oxygenation criteria for PARDS. (Ungraded DS, 96% agreement).

Definition statement 1.6.4. Patients with chronic lung disease who receive IMV at baseline or have cyanotic congenital heart disease with acute onset of illness that fulfills standard PARDS criteria should not be stratified by OI or OSI risk categories. Future studies are necessary to determine PARDS risk stratification of such patients with acute-on-chronic hypoxemic respiratory failure. (Ungraded DS, 90% agreement).

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the evaluation and management of adult patients presenting to the emergency department with acute heart failure syndromes: approved by ACEP board of directors, June 23, 2022 [^8f3f511a]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Acute heart failure syndromes—noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation in the emergency department is addressed with graded recommendations and supporting evidence: Level A recommendations are none specified. Level B recommendations state to use 5 to 10 mm Hg CPAP by nasal or face mask for dyspneic patients with acute heart failure syndrome without hypotension or the need for emergent intubation to improve heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, and reduce intubation and possibly reduce inhospital mortality. Level C recommendations state to consider using BiPAP as an alternative to CPAP for dyspneic patients with acute heart failure syndrome; however, data about the possible association between BiPAP and myocardial infarction remain unclear. Supporting text notes that initial studies of CPAP at 5 to 10 mm Hg consistently showed significant improvements in oxygenation and reductions in heart rate, respiratory rate, and blood pressure versus standard oxygen therapy, yet with the exception of one study that showed a reduction in mortality, a statistically significant benefit over standard oxygen therapy has not been found for hospital length of stay and mortality.

### High-flow nasal oxygen vs noninvasive positive airway pressure in hypoxemic patients after cardiothoracic surgery: a randomized clinical trial [^482c8dc8]. JAMA (2015). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Noninvasive ventilation delivered as bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) is often used to avoid reintubation and improve outcomes of patients with hypoxemia after cardiothoracic surgery. High-flow nasal oxygen therapy is increasingly used to improve oxygenation because of its ease of implementation, tolerance, and clinical effectiveness.

Objective

To determine whether high-flow nasal oxygen therapy was not inferior to BiPAP for preventing or resolving acute respiratory failure after cardiothoracic surgery.

Design and Setting

Multicenter, randomized, noninferiority trial (BiPOP Study) conducted between June 15, 2011, and January 15, 2014, at 6 French intensive care units.

Participants

A total of 830 patients who had undergone cardiothoracic surgery, of which coronary artery bypass, valvular repair, and pulmonary thromboendarterectomy were the most common, were included when they developed acute respiratory failure (failure of a spontaneous breathing trial or successful breathing trial but failed extubation) or were deemed at risk for respiratory failure after extubation due to preexisting risk factors.

Interventions

Patients were randomly assigned to receive high-flow nasal oxygen therapy delivered continuously through a nasal cannula (flow, 50 L/min; fraction of inspired oxygen [FiO2], 50%) (n=414) or BiPAP delivered with a full-face mask for at least 4 hours per day (pressure support level, 8 cm H2O; positive end-expiratory pressure, 4 cm H2O; FiO2, 50%) (n=416).

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was treatment failure, defined as reintubation, switch to the other study treatment, or premature treatment discontinuation (patient request or adverse effects, including gastric distention). Noninferiority of high-flow nasal oxygen therapy would be demonstrated if the lower boundary of the 95% CI were less than 9%. Secondary outcomes included mortality during intensive care unit stay, changes in respiratory variables, and respiratory complications.

Results

High-flow nasal oxygen therapy was not inferior to BiPAP: the treatment failed in 87 of 414 patients with high-flow nasal oxygen therapy (21.0%) and 91 of 416 patients with BiPAP (21.9%) (absolute difference, 0.9%; 95% CI, -4.9% to 6.6%; P=.003). No significant differences were found for intensive care unit mortality (23 patients with BiPAP [5.5%] and 28 with high-flow nasal oxygen therapy [6.8%]; P=.66) (absolute difference, 1.2% [95% CI, -2.3% to 4.8%]. Skin breakdown was significantly more common with BiPAP after 24 hours (10% vs 3%; 95% CI, 7.3%-13.4% vs 1.8%-5.6%; P<.001).

Conclusions and Relevance

Among cardiothoracic surgery patients with or at risk for respiratory failure, the use of high-flow nasal oxygen therapy compared with intermittent BiPAP did not result in a worse rate of treatment failure. The findings support the use of high-flow nasal oxygen therapy in similar patients.

### A national model for developing, implementing, and evaluating evidence-based guidelines for prehospital care [^c3e74362]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

Noninvasive ventilation (NIV) targets and technique in COPD emphasize SpO2 of ≥ 94%, while chronic COPD patients tolerate hypoxia better and an SpO2 of 90% may relieve their symptoms and be adequate; goals include normalization of respiratory rate (decreased tachypnea) and normalization of end-tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO2) as a downward trend, though patients with end stage COPD may have chronically elevated EtCO2 as high as 50s–60s so normalization may not be a good target. For patients not previously using NIV, the key is coaching, explanation of the process, and reassurance, and maintaining a continuous mask seal is essential to maximizing the positive impact of PEEP, particularly at higher levels; breaking the circuit or removing the mask should be meticulously avoided. Nebulized medications may be administered through a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) mask, and a specialized T-connector with a spring valve assembly is required to allow maintenance of positive airway pressure.

Idiopathic pulmonary haemosiderosis (IPH) is a rare condition associated with diffuse alveolar haemorrhage and pulmonary fibrosis. We describe the anaesthetic management of a parturient with a history of posterior spinal fusion presenting with an acute exacerbation of IPH necessitating vaginal delivery at 34 weeks gestation. We used a spinal catheter for labour analgesia and bilevel positive airway pressure (BIPAP) ventilation to improve oxygenation during labour. An arterial line sited to allow frequent arterial blood gas sampling also facilitated continuous cardiac output monitoring. The use of a carefully titrated neuraxial block for analgesia, in conjunction with BIPAP, was associated with minimal haemodynamic and respiratory compromise during labour in this patient.

### Non-invasive ventilation for the management of acute hypercapnic respiratory failure due to exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^a6db83e8]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) with bi-level positive airway pressure (BiPAP) is commonly used to treat patients admitted to hospital with acute hypercapnic respiratory failure (AHRF) secondary to an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD).

Objectives

To compare the efficacy of NIV applied in conjunction with usual care versus usual care involving no mechanical ventilation alone in adults with AHRF due to AECOPD. The aim of this review is to update the evidence base with the goals of supporting clinical practice and providing recommendations for future evaluation and research.

Search Methods

We identified trials from the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register of trials (CAGR), which is derived from systematic searches of bibliographic databases including the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), the Allied and Complementary Medicine Database (AMED), and PsycINFO, and through handsearching of respiratory journals and meeting abstracts. This update to the original review incorporates the results of database searches up to January 2017.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials that compared usual care plus NIV (BiPAP) versus usual care alone in an acute hospital setting for patients with AECOPD due to AHRF were eligible for inclusion. AHRF was defined by a mean admission pH < 7.35 and mean partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO 2 ) > 45 mmHg (6 kPa). Primary review outcomes were mortality during hospital admission and need for endotracheal intubation. Secondary outcomes included hospital length of stay, treatment intolerance, complications, changes in symptoms, and changes in arterial blood gases.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently applied the selection criteria to determine study eligibility, performed data extraction, and determined risk of bias in accordance with Cochrane guidelines. Review authors undertook meta-analysis for data that were both clinically and statistically homogenous, and analysed data as both one overall pooled sample and according to two predefined subgroups related to exacerbation severity (admission pH between 7.35 and 7.30 vs below 7.30) and NIV treatment setting (intensive care unit-based vs ward-based). We reported results for mortality, need for endotracheal intubation, and hospital length of stay in a 'Summary of findings' table and rated their quality in accordance with GRADE criteria.

Main Results

We included in the review 17 randomised controlled trials involving 1264 participants. Available data indicate that mean age at recruitment was 66.8 years (range 57.7 to 70.5 years) and that most participants (65%) were male. Most studies (12/17) were at risk of performance bias, and for most (14/17), the risk of detection bias was uncertain. These risks may have affected subjective patient-reported outcome measures (e.g. dyspnoea) and secondary review outcomes, respectively.Use of NIV decreased the risk of mortality by 46% (risk ratio (RR) 0.54, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.38 to 0.76; N = 12 studies; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 12, 95% CI 9 to 23) and decreased the risk of needing endotracheal intubation by 65% (RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.46; N = 17 studies; NNTB 5, 95% CI 5 to 6). We graded both outcomes as 'moderate' quality owing to uncertainty regarding risk of bias for several studies. Inspection of the funnel plot related to need for endotracheal intubation raised the possibility of some publication bias pertaining to this outcome. NIV use was also associated with reduced length of hospital stay (mean difference (MD) -3.39 days, 95% CI -5.93 to -0.85; N = 10 studies), reduced incidence of complications (unrelated to NIV) (RR 0.26, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.53; N = 2 studies), and improvement in pH (MD 0.05, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.07; N = 8 studies) and in partial pressure of oxygen (PaO 2 ) (MD 7.47 mmHg, 95% CI 0.78 to 14.16 mmHg; N = 8 studies) at one hour. A trend towards improvement in PaCO 2 was observed, but this finding was not statistically significant (MD -4.62 mmHg, 95% CI -11.05 to 1.80 mmHg; N = 8 studies). Post hoc analysis revealed that this lack of benefit was due to the fact that data from two studies at high risk of bias showed baseline imbalance for this outcome (worse in the NIV group than in the usual care group). Sensitivity analysis revealed that exclusion of these two studies resulted in a statistically significant positive effect of NIV on PaCO 2 . Treatment intolerance was significantly greater in the NIV group than in the usual care group (risk difference (RD) 0.11, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.17; N = 6 studies). Results of analysis showed a non-significant trend towards reduction in dyspnoea with NIV compared with usual care (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.16, 95% CI -0.34 to 0.02; N = 4 studies). Subgroup analyses revealed no significant between-group differences.

Authors' Conclusions

Data from good quality randomised controlled trials show that NIV is beneficial as a first-line intervention in conjunction with usual care for reducing the likelihood of mortality and endotracheal intubation in patients admitted with acute hypercapnic respiratory failure secondary to an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The magnitude of benefit for these outcomes appears similar for patients with acidosis of a mild (pH 7.30 to 7.35) versus a more severe nature (pH < 7.30), and when NIV is applied within the intensive care unit (ICU) or ward setting.

### An integrated approach to diagnosis and management of severe haemoptysis in patients admitted to the intensive care unit: a case series from a referral centre [^b0347e00]. Respiratory Research (2007). Low credibility.

Patients and methods

Patients

The study was conducted between January 1999 and December 2001 in Tenon hospital, a tertiary university hospital and referral centre for haemoptysis in Paris, France. All consecutive patients admitted to the respiratory intermediate care ward or ICU for severe haemoptysis were eligible. Exclusion criteria were iatrogenic bleeding, bleeding of gastrointestinal and oropharyngeal origin, heart failure, intra alveolar haemorrhage and incomplete data. For each patient, the following information were recorded: baseline demographics, comorbid conditions, initial clinical presentation and vital signs, laboratory tests results, chest radiography, fiberoptic bronchoscopy and CT scan findings when performed, severity of haemoptysis, and pre-ICU and in-ICU management. The persistence or recurrence of bleeding, the patients' ICU and hospital lengths of stay and their vital status at discharge were recorded, as well as the occurrence of long-term rebleeding. Patients with recurrent haemoptysis were included at the first episode only.

Definitions

1. Severity of haemoptysis

The severity of haemoptysis on admission was assessed according to (i) the cumulated amount of bleeding; (ii) the consequences of bleeding; (iii) and the presence of associated severe cardiovascular and pulmonary comorbidities. The cumulated amount of bleeding on admission was assessed from the onset of bleeding until the first hours of admission to our unit using the following standardized scale: a spoonful (5 ml), a small filled glass (100 ml) and a large filled glass (200 ml). The consequences of bleeding were assessed on the need for administration of local or systemic terlipressin, mechanical ventilation, vasoactive drugs or blood transfusions before referral or within the first 24 hours of ICU admission.

2. Cause of haemoptysis

The cause of haemoptysis was diagnosed on the combination of history, physical examination, chest radiography, fiberoptic bronchoscopy, CT scan, microbiology and histology when available. Definite causes were bronchiectasis (including inactive tuberculosis), active tuberculosis, cancer and mycetoma. Pulmonary venous thrombo-embolic disease, pneumonia and emphysema were classified as probable causes. Haemoptysis was considered cryptogenic when no cause was evidenced.

3. Course of haemoptysis

Immediate control of bleeding was defined as a cessation of bleeding obtained without recurrence until hospital discharge, whatever the therapeutic option used. Rebleeding was defined as the persistence and/or the recurrence of bleeding after treatment. Early-onset rebleeding was defined as occurring within the first 30 days, and late-onset as rebleeding after one month.

### A comparison of continuous and bi-level positive airway pressure non-invasive ventilation in patients with acute cardiogenic pulmonary oedema: a meta-analysis [^091f238f]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

Introduction

Acute cardiogenic pulmonary oedema is a common medical emergency. The majority of patients with acute pulmonary oedema will improve with oxygen and pharmacological therapy. However, assisted ventilation may be needed in patients with severe cardiogenic pulmonary oedema who remain hypoxaemic and in respiratory distress despite conventional medical therapy.

Studies have shown that noninvasive continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) ventilation can improve gas exchange, decrease respiratory and heart rate, reduce the need for invasive ventilation [-] and reduce hospital mortality. Noninvasive bi-level positive airway pressure (BiPAP) ventilation delivers positive airway pressure at two different levels during inspiration and expiration, and can decrease inspiratory work of breathing more than CPAP can alone. Studies evaluating BiPAP in acute cardiogenic pulmonary oedema have shown that it improves gas exchange and reduces the need for invasive ventilation in patients with hypercapnic respiratory failure compared with conventional medical therapy. However, none of these studies demonstrated a reduction in hospital mortality. Furthermore, the results of one of the earlier studies suggested that BiPAP compared with CPAP might increase the risk for new onset acute myocardial infarction in patients with acute cardiogenic pulmonary oedema. Whether BiPAP is advantageous compared with CPAP in acute cardiogenic pulmonary oedema remains uncertain.

In the present meta-analysis we assessed the potential beneficial and harmful effects of BiPAP compared with CPAP in patients with acute cardiogenic pulmonary oedema. We also assessed whether the BiPAP may be more advantageous when the pressure used during BiPAP is titrated according to clinical need and in the subgroup of patients with significant hypercapnia (mean arterial carbon dioxide tension [PaCO 2] > 45 mmHg).

### Brensocatib (brinsupri) [^74f8b2ec]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

The efficacy of BRINSUPRI was evaluated in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter, multinational clinical trials (ASPEN [NCT04594369] and WILLOW [NCT03218917]).

ASPEN was a 52-week trial that included 1721 adult and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older with NCFB (1680 adults and 41 pediatric patients 12 years of age to less than 18 years of age) who were randomized to BRINSUPRI 10 mg (n=583), BRINSUPRI 25 mg (n=575), or placebo (n=563) administered orally once daily.

WILLOW was a 24-week trial that included 256 adult patients with NCFB who were randomized to BRINSUPRI 10 mg (n=82), BRINSUPRI 25 mg (n=87), or placebo (n=87) administered orally once daily.

In both ASPEN and WILLOW, all adult patients had a history of confirmed NCFB by chest computed tomography with at least 2 documented pulmonary exacerbations (PEx) prior to screening in the past 12 months. In ASPEN, pediatric patients 12 years of age and older had at least one PEx in the prior 12 months.

Demographics and baseline characteristics of patients in ASPEN and WILLOW are provided in Table 2 .

ASPEN

The primary efficacy endpoint in ASPEN was the annualized rate of PEx over the 52-week treatment period.

Pulmonary exacerbations were defined as worsening of 3 or more of the following major symptoms over 48 hours: increased cough, increased sputum volume or change in sputum consistency, increased sputum purulence, increased breathlessness, decreased exercise tolerance, fatigue and/or malaise, and hemoptysis, resulting in a healthcare provider's decision to prescribe systemic antibiotics. Pulmonary exacerbations were considered severe if requiring treatment with intravenous antibacterial drugs and/or resulted in hospitalization.

Treatment with BRINSUPRI 10 mg or 25 mg in patients with NCFB demonstrated reductions in the mean rate of PEx over 52 weeks compared with placebo (Figure 1). Table 3 provides the results of the annualized rate of PEx, and the results of the key secondary endpoints in ASPEN of time to first PEx, proportion of patients remaining exacerbation free throughout the 52-week treatment period, annualized rate of severe PEx, and the change from baseline in post-bronchodilator FEV1.

### A retrospective analysis of risk factors for massive hemoptysis in patients with bronchiectasis [^78f8be06]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hemoptysis is a daily diagnostic challenge and is associated with potentially life-threatening medical conditions. Massive hemoptysis is a life threatening condition with high mortality rates. Bronchiectasis is one of the most common causes of massive hemoptysis and is also a frequent cause of hospitalization. Mondoni M reported that bronchiectasis is the leading predictor of hemoptysis relapse. As a result of the significant negative impact of severe hemoptysis in patients with bronchiectasis, it is certainly important for us to understand its risk factors and prevent patients from developing massive hemoptysis. The risk factors for severe hemoptysis in patients with bronchiectasis are not well known. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the potential risk factors associated with massive hemoptysis in patients with bronchiectasis.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the evaluation and management of adult patients presenting to the emergency department with acute heart failure syndromes: approved by ACEP board of directors, June 23, 2022 [^a9dc0409]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Noninvasive ventilation (continuous positive airway pressure [CPAP] and bilevel positive airway pressure [BiPAP]) in acute heart failure—In a study of 89 consecutive elderly patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (PaO2/ FIO2 ≤300), CPAP reduced the need for ventilatory assistance and early 48-hour mortality compared with standard oxygen with no difference in hospital length of stay. Specifically, the need for ventilatory assistance was 17% less (P=0.01) in the CPAP group (7%) compared to standard oxygen (24%), and early 48-hour mortality was 21% less (P=0.017) in the CPAP group (9%) compared to standard oxygen (30%). Evidence for BiPAP was mixed: in a 2000 trial of 37 patients, intubation was significantly less with BiPAP (5% versus 33%; P=0.04) with faster symptom resolution defined by oxygen saturation ≥ 96% and respiratory rate <30 breaths/min, whereas a 1997 trial halted after enrollment of 27 patients found higher myocardial infarction in the BiPAP group (71%, N=10, P=0.06) versus CPAP (31%, N=4) with extremely large 95% confidence intervals (9% to 76%). Additional studies showed no clear superiority or differences: an out-of-hospital comparison reported BiPAP was associated with increased intubation, myocardial infarction, and a combined endpoint within 24 hours; a 2001 convenience sample of 38 randomized to BiPAP or conventional oxygen found no statistically significant differences in heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygenation, rate of intubation, hospital length of stay, or myocardial infarction; a 2002 crossover study of 6 patients sequentially receiving CPAP 5 mm Hg, CPAP 10 mm Hg, and BiPAP 10/5 mm Hg found no significant difference in oxygenation or hemodynamic response; and a 2004 randomized head-to-head trial of 46 patients comparing CPAP 10 mm Hg to BiPAP 15/5 mm Hg found no differences in myocardial infarction, intubation, or inhospital mortality.
