## Question

Direct versus indirect hernias

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about direct versus indirect inguinal hernias, specifically seeking a comparison of their anatomy, pathophysiology, epidemiology, diagnosis, and management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core anatomical distinctions and how they guide classification. Then, I should verify the pathophysiology and risk factors that differ between types. Next, I will review epidemiology and clinical presentation. After that, I need to check diagnostic accuracy and imaging strategies. Finally, I will examine management principles, including emergency care, surgical approach selection, and mesh/fixation choices, and close with a concise synthesis that ties these elements together.

> Let me first confirm the fundamental anatomical distinction, because everything else flows from it. Indirect inguinal hernias protrude through the deep inguinal ring, traverse the inguinal canal, and exit via the superficial ring, typically lateral to the inferior epigastric vessels; by contrast, direct inguinal hernias push through the posterior wall of the inguinal canal within Hesselbach's triangle, medial to the inferior epigastric vessels, and do not follow the spermatic cord pathway, which is why they are often described as going straight through the floor rather than obliquely through the canal.

> Wait, let me verify the pathophysiology before I overgeneralize. Indirect hernias are fundamentally congenital, driven by a patent processus vaginalis that fails to obliterate, creating a preformed sac along the spermatic cord or round ligament; this is why pediatric hernias are overwhelmingly indirect and why cryptorchidism and prematurity increase risk, reflecting abnormal obliteration and EMT-related defects in the processus vaginalis [^241cf79c] [^4d4e2b7b]. Direct hernias, in contrast, are acquired and reflect a failure of the transversalis fascia and floor of the inguinal canal, with connective tissue alterations including a lower type I:III collagen ratio and dysregulation of MMPs/TIMPs, which explains higher recurrence and associations with systemic connective tissue phenotypes [^a98caf02] [^082a83ce] [^c1a8c4d8].

> I should double-check epidemiology and sex patterns. Indirect hernias are more common overall, with a rough 2:1 predominance over direct hernias in adults, and they dominate in children and in men; direct hernias increase with age and are more often bilateral, consistent with acquired fascial degeneration and systemic connective tissue vulnerability rather than a focal congenital defect [^241cf79c]. Hold on, I should verify the lifetime risk figures; yes, approximately 27% of men and 3% of women will undergo inguinal hernia repair in their lifetime, which aligns with the male predominance seen clinically and in registries [^bd343c41].

> Next, I should review how we diagnose and distinguish them, and I need to be honest about the limits of the exam. Preoperative differentiation by physical examination is notoriously inaccurate, with skilled examiners misclassifying up to 30% of cases; even with refined maneuvers, accuracy improves but remains imperfect, reinforcing the need for intraoperative confirmation and, when needed, imaging. Ultrasound is the first-line modality when the diagnosis is uncertain or occult, with dynamic assessment and Valsalva improving sensitivity; CT or MRI are reserved for complex, recurrent, or preoperative planning scenarios, and can reliably distinguish direct from indirect hernias by vessel relationships and trajectory [^cc7cf555] [^f46a3509] [^d1e314b5].

> Let me consider management principles, starting with indications. Symptomatic hernias should generally be repaired, whereas asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic hernias may be observed with shared decision-making; however, incarceration and strangulation are surgical emergencies, and early intervention is indicated when strangulation is suspected or reduction fails [^826a4b42] [^aa8875b4]. I should confirm that watchful waiting is reasonable in select men, but long-term crossover to surgery is common, which tempers the appeal of prolonged observation in active patients [^81c3c84e].

> Now, I will examine surgical approach selection, and I need to ensure I align with high-quality guidance. For primary unilateral hernias, laparoendoscopic repair (TAPP or TEP) reduces acute and chronic pain and accelerates recovery compared with open repair, provided the surgeon has appropriate expertise; open Lichtenstein remains an excellent option and is still widely used, particularly in resource-limited settings or when laparoscopy is contraindicated [^0f7004ca] [^e9b0d8b4] [^95a4c9dc]. Hold on, I should verify the role of laparoscopy in women; yes, guidelines favor laparoscopy in women to mitigate chronic pain and to avoid missing synchronous femoral hernias, which occur more frequently in females [^6b07e0bd].

> I should confirm mesh and fixation nuances because they differ by defect. For large direct defects, heavyweight mesh and fixation are recommended to reduce recurrence, whereas lightweight mesh is preferred for Lichtenstein repairs to minimize chronic pain; nonfixation can be considered in small defects but may increase recurrence risk in larger direct hernias, so fixation decisions should be individualized to defect size and approach [^fa4c6c6c] [^71432cdc] [^d241dae6]. Let me reconsider the emergency setting; in contaminated fields, macroporous mesh can be considered, and biological mesh is an option when primary closure is not feasible, balancing infection risk against recurrence [^83fe825e] [^23816930].

> For indirect hernias, I need to check sac management. Complete sac reduction is standard, but large, deep indirect sacs can be transected proximally and left open distally to reduce cord trauma and ischemia risk, albeit with a higher seroma rate; this trade-off is acceptable in experienced hands and is reflected in endoscopic guidance [^7b3f3ef9] [^0ed4b4e1]. But wait, what if the sac is densely adherent or the ring is tight? Gentle traction, external pressure, and judicious enlargement of the internal ring are acceptable strategies to achieve reduction without blind force, which reduces ischemic injury to the cord or bowel [^41149124].

> For direct hernias, I should confirm that pseudosac recognition is crucial. The invaginated transversalis fascia can mimic a sac; separating and reducing this pseudosac, and sometimes inverting or closing the attenuated floor with a suture, reduces seroma and improves mesh seating, which is particularly relevant in TEP repairs of large direct defects [^c2de25c9] [^56fbb665]. Hold on, I should verify that this inversion step is supported; yes, endoscopic guidance supports transversalis fascia inversion or closure for large direct defects to mitigate seroma and improve outcomes [^56fbb665].

> I will now examine emergency care and incarceration. Laparoscopy is feasible and safe for incarcerated or strangulated hernias in experienced centers, allowing assessment of bowel viability, reduction of contents, and definitive repair; however, unstable patients or those with perforation and sepsis may require open management, and mesh choice should reflect contamination risk [^7db43d5f] [^0ed4b4e1] [^83fe825e]. Let me double-check the technical pearls for reduction; incising the hernia ring ventrolaterally for indirect and ventromedially for direct hernias avoids epigastric vessel injury and facilitates safe reduction, which is consistently emphasized in laparoscopic emergency series [^0ed4b4e1] [^79251465].

> Next, I should review pediatric considerations briefly. Pediatric inguinal hernias are overwhelmingly indirect and carry a meaningful incarceration risk, especially in infants, so timely repair after stabilization is standard; laparoscopy is increasingly used and allows evaluation of the contralateral side, though routine contralateral exploration remains controversial and should be individualized [^241cf79c] [^16b7d528]. Hold on, I should verify that high ligation of the sac remains the essential step; yes, whether open or laparoscopic, the principle is the same in children [^241cf79c].

> Let me synthesize the key differentiators succinctly. Indirect hernias are congenital, lateral to the inferior epigastric vessels, follow the spermatic cord or round ligament, and are more common in children and men; direct hernias are acquired, medial to the inferior epigastric vessels, bulge through the floor of the inguinal canal, and increase with age and connective tissue disease; these distinctions drive diagnostic strategy, operative planning, and recurrence-prevention tactics in modern hernia care [^bd343c41].

---

Direct and indirect hernias are distinguished by **anatomy and pathophysiology**: direct hernias protrude through the posterior wall of the inguinal canal medial to the inferior epigastric vessels, whereas indirect hernias pass through the deep inguinal ring lateral to the vessels and may descend into the scrotum or labia. Direct hernias are **acquired** from transversalis fascia weakness and are more common in older men, while indirect hernias are **congenital** from a patent processus vaginalis and predominate in infants and younger men [^d3a98bd9] [^241cf79c]. Clinically, indirect hernias are more prone to incarceration and are harder to reduce, whereas direct hernias are less likely to strangulate but may recur more often [^notfound]. Diagnosis is clinical, with ultrasound or CT used when uncertain, and management is surgical — open or laparoscopic — with mesh favored for most adults to reduce recurrence [^cc7cf555] [^f46a3509] [^0f7004ca].

## Anatomical differences

| **Feature** | **Direct hernia** | **Indirect hernia** |
|-|-|-|
| Location | Medial to inferior epigastric vessels, through Hesselbach's triangle | Lateral to inferior epigastric vessels, through deep inguinal ring |
| Pathway | Through posterior wall of inguinal canal | Through inguinal canal, may descend into scrotum/labia |
| Origin | Acquired weakness of transversalis fascia | Congenital patent processus vaginalis |

---

## Pathophysiology

- **Direct hernia**: Acquired defect from age-related degeneration, chronic cough, constipation, or heavy lifting causing transversalis fascia weakness [^886e5611] [^a98caf02].
- **Indirect hernia**: Congenital failure of processus vaginalis obliteration, allowing peritoneal sac to follow the spermatic cord or round ligament [^241cf79c] [^4d4e2b7b].

---

## Clinical presentation

- **Direct hernia**: Painless bulge in Hesselbach's triangle, reducible, less prone to incarceration/strangulation [^notfound].
- **Indirect hernia**: Bulge from groin to scrotum/labia, more likely to incarcerate or strangulate, especially in infants [^241cf79c] [^335ccdda].

---

## Diagnostic methods

Clinical examination is the **primary method**, though distinguishing types can be challenging [^886e5611]. Ultrasound is **first-line** for equivocal cases or to confirm type [^cc7cf555]. CT or MRI is reserved for complex, recurrent, or preoperative planning [^f46a3509] [^d1e314b5].

---

## Treatment strategies

- **Surgical repair**: Indicated for symptomatic, incarcerated, or high-risk hernias; options include open (Lichtenstein, Shouldice) or laparoscopic (TAPP, TEP) [^0f7004ca] [^ab7272be].
- **Mesh**: Reduces recurrence; lightweight mesh lowers chronic pain; fixation tailored to defect size and type [^71432cdc] [^f2a7eb7a].
- **Emergency**: Immediate repair for strangulation or failed reduction [^826a4b42] [^aa8875b4].

---

## Complications

Complications include **recurrence**, which is more common with direct hernias and relates to tissue quality and repair technique [^a98caf02] [^886e5611]. Incarceration/strangulation is more frequent with indirect hernias and requires urgent surgery [^notfound]. Chronic pain can follow any repair but is less with lightweight mesh and meticulous technique [^71432cdc].

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis is **excellent** with modern repair; recurrence is low with mesh and experienced surgeons, and recovery is faster with laparoscopic approaches [^0f7004ca] [^e9b0d8b4].

---

Direct and indirect hernias differ in origin, location, and risk profile; **accurate diagnosis and tailored surgery** — often with mesh — yield excellent outcomes.

Inguinal hernias are a common problem but often present with diagnostic dilemmas, in part as a result of the complex anatomy of the region. A simplified analogy is put forward in the hope of increasing the understanding of the anatomy and some guidance given in an endeavor to differentiate direct and indirect hernias, with significance to their possible complication rates.

### Diagnosis of inguinal region hernias with axial CT: the lateral crescent sign and other key findings [^91799c6b]. Radiographics (2011). Low credibility.

Differentiation of direct inguinal hernias, indirect inguinal hernias, and femoral hernias is often difficult at clinical examination and presents challenges even at diagnostic imaging. With the advent of higher-resolution multidetector computed tomography (CT), the minute anatomic detail of the inguinal region can be better delineated. The authors examine the appearance of these hernias at axial CT, as the axial plane remains the diagnostic mainstay of evaluation of acute abdomen. They review and label key anatomic structures, present cases of direct and indirect inguinal hernias and femoral hernias, and demonstrate their anatomic differences on axial images. Direct inguinal hernias protrude anteromedial and inferior to the course of the inferior epigastric vessels, whereas indirect inguinal hernias protrude posterolateral and superior to the course of those vessels. The proposed lateral crescent sign may be useful in diagnosis of early direct inguinal hernias, as it represents lateral compression and stretching of the inguinal canal fat and contents by the hernia sac. Femoral hernias protrude inferior to the course of the inferior epigastric vessels and medial to the common femoral vein, often have a narrow funnel-shaped neck, and may compress the femoral vein, causing engorgement of distal collateral veins. Familiarity with these anatomic differences at axial CT, along with the lateral crescent sign of direct inguinal hernias, may help the radiologist better assist the clinician in accurate diagnosis of the major types of hernias of the inguinal region.

Comments

Cost calculations in treatment of inguinal hernias are difficult to perform mainly due to the multitude of factors having some influence on the costs. In 2006 a large randomized controlled study (RCT) showed that at 2 years "watchful waiting" (WW) is a cost-effective treatment option for men with minimal or no groin hernia symptoms [1]. But 7 years later the same group of authors found a long-term crossover rate of 68% and concluded that although WW is a reasonable and safe strategy, symptoms will likely progress and an operation will be needed eventually [2]. In accordance with this long-term result a large register study from UK recently published demonstrated that hernia surgery offers value for money [3]. Moreover these authors found laparoscopic repair more cost-effective and providing less money per quality adjusted live years (QALY) in comparison to open surgery. Two previously published comprehensive reviews reported similar results [4, 5].

Other clinical scenarios

Some surgeons believe women should undergo laparoscopic repair for all direct and indirect inguinal hernias, since synchronous femoral hernias are found in up to 40% of cases and are frequently missed. Other good candidates for laparoscopy are patients who engage in intense physical activity, such as professional athletes, since laparoscopy avoids dividing the aponeurosis of the external oblique and minimizes scar tissue between muscle planes.

### Surgical options in the management of groin hernias… [^886e5611]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

Epidemiology In the United States, approximately 96 percent of groin hernias are inguinal and 4 percent are femoral. Inguinal hernias are bilateral in as many as 20 percent of affected adults.

1. Anatomy of Groin Hernias Inguinal hernias are broadly classified as indirect or direct, designations that refer to the relation of the herniation to the inferior epigastric arteries on the abdominal wall and the Hesselbach's triangle. The anatomic region known as Hesselbach's triangle is defined laterally by the inferior epigastric artery, medially by the lateral border of the rectus muscle and inferiorly by the inguinal ligament. An indirect hernia passes lateral to the inferior epigastric vessels and thus is outside of Hesselbach's triangle, while a direct hernia is medial to the epigastric vessels and therefore within the confines of this space. An indirect hernia is generally believed to have a congenital component.

The development of this type of hernia requires a potential hernia sac, which is provided by the processus vaginalis. After the fetal testis has descended into the scrotum from the retroperitoneum, the processus vaginalis normally obliterates, thereby removing this potential for herniation. Thus, an indirect hernia is the result of two conditions: the existence of a potential space due to nonobliteration of the processus vaginalis and a weakening of the fascia of the transversalis muscle fibers surrounding the exit of the spermatic cord at the internal abdominal ring. Direct inguinal hernias are not generally congenital. Instead, they are acquired by the development of tissue deficiencies of the transversus abdominis muscle, which makes up the floor of the inguinal canal. Thus, these hernias protrude directly through a defect in the inguinal canal floor, rather than indirectly following the potential space of the processus vaginalis and the path of the spermatic cord.

Preoperatively, it is often difficult to differentiate the common indirect hernia from the less common direct defect. Even skilled examiners may be incorrect in up to 30 percent of cases. However, indirect and direct hernias need to be differentiated during surgery, because the approach to repair depends on the defect type. A hernia that is not repaired appropriately is more likely to recur.

### A genome-wide association study identifies four novel susceptibility loci underlying inguinal hernia [^d3a98bd9]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

Direct and indirect inguinal hernia

Inguinal hernias can be classified as direct, in which the abdominal contents herniate through the floor of the inguinal canal due to an acquired weakness in the transversalis fascia, or indirect, in which abdominal contents protrude through a congenital defect in the inguinal ring via enlargement of a patent processus vaginalis. We analysed the four inguinal hernia risk SNPs in GERA subjects with direct and indirect hernias separately to determine whether any of them predisposed subjects to a specific subtype of inguinal hernia. The ORs observed for direct inguinal hernia were slightly stronger for three of the four top SNPs in men than for indirect inguinal hernia (Table 2). In women, for whom there were fewer subjects with inguinal hernias (N = 549), only rs2009262 and rs3809060 were nominally associated with direct or indirect inguinal hernia (P < 0.05), and both displayed larger effects for indirect compared with direct inguinal hernia.

We then examined the association of SNPs in the region (± 250 kb) of the four hernia susceptibility loci with direct and indirect hernia in men. The four top SNPs associated with inguinal hernia were also the most strongly associated SNPs with indirect inguinal hernia, but for three of the four loci, other SNPs in the region were more strongly associated with direct inguinal hernia, specifically rs11899888 (instead of rs2009262) in EFEMP1, rs12520760 (instead of rs370763) in ADAMTS6 and rs10746560 (instead of rs6991952) in EBF2 (Supplementary Fig. 2). This indicates that multiple variants within these risk loci may underlie the different subtypes of inguinal hernia.

To determine whether specific biological pathways or functions play a role in inguinal hernia development, we conducted a gene set enrichment analysis of our discovery cohort results using the program Meta-Analysis Gene-set Enrichment of variant Associations (MAGENTA). We identified four gene sets at a false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05: Jak Stat signalling, leukocyte extravasation signalling, actin cytoskeleton signalling and glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis chondroitin sulfate (Supplementary Table 3). We then used RegulomeDB to investigate the potential for SNPs in the identified inguinal hernia risk loci to influence the binding of transcription factors. We identified 14 SNPs in the four regions that were classified as likely to affect transcription factor binding (Supplementary Table 4).

### Comparison of hernia sac transection and full sac reduction for the treatment of inguinal hernias: a systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical trials [^7df03dc1]. World Journal of Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

2 Methods

The study protocol for this systematic review and meta‐analysis was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42022306845). We conducted a systematic review of literature updated on 1 October 2022 according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.

2.1 Types of Studies

All randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and clinical control studies (CCT) were included, regardless of their publishing status, language of publication, or if outcomes were provided.

2.2 Types of Participants

Our study encompassed both children (0–18 years) and adults with inguinal hernia who received any type of suture repair, as well as adults who underwent Lichtenstein open tension‐free repair for primary inguinal hernia. There were no limitations based on race or sex. We excluded studies that combined data from both adults and children and instead included only studies where data were reported separately for each subgroup (adults and children). We have included studies of all types of inguinal hernias (direct or indirect) without considering their size or bilaterality. Irrespective of the length of follow‐up, we included all studies that reported data on the primary or secondary outcomes.

2.3 Types of Interventions

Patients were undergone at open inguinal hernia repair and sac transection with or without ligation. Only patients who had undergone elective repairs were included, whereas those who underwent emergency repairs were excluded.

2.4 Types of Outcome Measures

2.4.1 Primary Outcomes

Recurrence of clinical hernia with a minimum follow‐up period of 12 months.
Groin discomfort following surgery is assessed with the visual analog scale (VAS) at three time points: 24 h, after 1 week, and 6 months or more.

2.4.2 Secondary Outcomes

Adverse effects occurring within 30 days following surgery include hematoma, wound infection, seroma, scrotal edema, urine retention, and testicular atrophy.

### If laparoscopic technique can be used for treatment of acutely incarcerated / strangulated inguinal hernia? [^79251465]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The safety and efficacy of laparoscopy have been proven in selective operations. However, the use of this approach in emergency cases is still controversial. The first treatment of an incarcerated inguinal hernia with a laparoscopic technique was reported in 1993. TAPP repair was gradually accepted thereafter. In 2013, the European Association for Endoscopic Surgery concluded that laparoscopy can be applied for treatment of incarcerated inguinal hernias. However, relevant studies are scarce, and the applications of TAPP repair remain largely debated.

Some authors have advocated the performance of hernia reduction under laparoscopic vision to increase the accuracy and safety of the procedure. Moreover, the laparoscopic approach allows for a more thorough internal abdomen exploration to evaluate organ vitality and provides sufficient time to make decisions regarding bowel resection. Another advantage of laparoscopy is that it facilitates diagnosis and treatment of contralateral hernias. The main challenges associated with laparoscopic emergency hernia repair are technical difficulties in dissection of the hernia sac, difficulties in hernia reduction through a narrowed inguinal ring, and an increased risk of iatrogenic injuries.

No specific parameters are available to estimate the technical difficulties of TAPP repair. Special techniques should be focused on hernia reduction. In our experience, hernia reduction has some technical key points. General anesthesia usually benefits hernia reduction. In some cases, the hernia contents reduce spontaneously after general anesthesia, while in others the hernia contents are reduced by direct traction or with manual compression from outside. Blind traction is forbidden. If this procedure fails, enlargement of the hernia ring facilitates hernia reduction. Our data revealed that hernia ring incision is a good means of hernia reduction, resulting in an easy reduction of hernia contents without additional injuries. We usually incise the hernia ring with an electronic hook in the preperitoneal plane. The peritoneum can provide protection to the incarcerated small bowel from iatrogenic injuries caused by the electronic hook. In our experience, it is recommended that the hernia ring is cut ventrolaterally for indirect hernias and ventromedially for direct hernias to avoid injury of the inferior epigastric artery. Other authors have stated similar concerns. Naturally, all procedures must be performed with great care. The use of non-traumatic forceps for hernia reduction is a good choice.

### Direct and recurrent inguinal hernias are associated with ventral hernia repair: a database study [^c1a8c4d8]. World Journal of Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Background

A systemically altered connective tissue metabolism has been demonstrated in patients with abdominal wall hernias. The most pronounced connective tissue changes are found in patients with direct or recurrent inguinal hernias as opposed to patients with indirect inguinal hernias. The aim of the present study was to assess whether direct or recurrent inguinal hernias are associated with an elevated rate of ventral hernia surgery.

Methods

In the nationwide Danish Hernia Database, a cohort of 92,457 patients operated on for inguinal hernias was recorded from January 1998 until June 2010. Eight-hundred forty-three (0.91%) of these patients underwent a ventral hernia operation between January 2007 and June 2010. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was applied to assess an association between inguinal and ventral hernia repair.

Results

Direct (Odds Ratio [OR] = 1.28 [95% CI, 1.08–1.51]) and recurrent (OR = 1.76, [95% CI, 1.39–2.23]) inguinal hernias were significantly associated with ventral hernia repair after adjustment for age, gender, and surgical approach (open or laparoscopic).

Conclusions

Patients with direct and recurrent inguinal herniation are more prone to ventral hernia repair than patients with indirect inguinal herniation. This is the first study to show that herniogenesis is associated with type of inguinal hernia.

### Association of exfoliation syndrome with risk of indirect inguinal hernia: the Utah project on exfoliation syndrome [^d591d4b9]. JAMA Ophthalmology (2018). Medium credibility.

Importance

Exfoliation syndrome (XFS) is a systemic connective tissue disease, and abnormal connective tissue metabolism is implicated in inguinal hernias (IH). Associating XFS with comorbid conditions may illuminate their underlying pathophysiology and affect clinical screening and treatment. Exfoliation syndrome involves altered systemic extracellular matrix (ECM) homeostasis involving elastin metabolism. Hernias occur owing to abnormal ECM synthesis, metabolism, or repair. Inguinal hernias involve weakening or rupture of the abdominal/groin wall.

Objective

To determine an association between patients with XFS and patients with IH in Utah, possibly differing between direct or indirect hernia.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Cross-sectional study in a large health care system of Utah hospitals and clinics. Conditional logistic regression odds ratios were used to estimate risk of XFS in patients with IH overall and by subtype (direct or indirect) compared with control individuals. Codes specific to direct and indirect IH with additional medical records review of 186 procedures were used to classify IH subtypes that were not prespecified. Bootstrap resampling with jackknife estimation used to calculate 95% confidence intervals. The model accounted for matching on sex and age and adjusted for body mass index and tobacco use. Population-based sample using medical records from 1996 to 2015 that identified 2594 patients 40 years or older on January 1, 1996, with surgical IH repair and 12 966 random control patients with no IH history matched 5:1 on sex and birth year. Data were analyzed between September 10, 2017, and October 23, 2017.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Exfoliation syndrome outcome defined by diagnosis codes for XFS or exfoliation glaucoma from 1996 to 2015.

Results

Participants were primarily white (2532 of 2594 patients, [96.1%]; 12 454 of 12 966 control individuals [97.6%]) and non-Hispanic (2396 of 2594 patients [92.4%]); 250 participants were women (9.6%). Of study participants, 22 patients with IH and 43 control individuals were diagnosed as having XFS, respectively. Patients with IH had a 2.3-fold risk for an XFS diagnosis compared with control individuals (95% CI, 1.4–3.5; P = 0.03), and XFS risk with indirect IH appeared especially pronounced.

Conclusions and Relevance

Inguinal hernia was associated with an increased risk of XFS in this Utah population. Further work is needed to understand the pathophysiology, genetics, and environmental factors contributing to both diseases.

Regarding surgical interventions for inguinal hernia, more specifically with respect to technical considerations for surgery (totally extraperitoneal endoscopic approach), IEHS 2015 guidelines recommend to consider closing large direct inguinal hernia defects with a pre-tied suture loop as an alternative to the fixation of the extended fascia transversalis to Copper's ligament.

### A genome-wide association study identifies four novel susceptibility loci underlying inguinal hernia [^73314ab8]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

Elastin is also a key component of transversalis fascia that complements the role of collagen by providing elasticity, which allows for the tissue to stretch and return to its original form. Mutations in the human elastin gene, ELN, cause cutis laxa, which has been associated with an increased risk of inguinal herniasand supravalvular aortic stenosis. In connective tissue, the integration of elastin to the microfibril scaffold is guided by fibulins; EFEMP1 is a member of the fibulin gene family, and the EFEMP1 protein binds tropoelastin, the building block of the elastin protein. EFEMP1 knockout mice have reduced elastic fibres in fascia and develop direct and indirect inguinal hernias. Variants in the EFEMP1 locus have also been associated with a number of conditions and functional changes, including differences in forced vital capacity, a measure of lung function. This shared association suggests that alterations in elastin maintenance may contribute to the development of both chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and inguinal hernia and may be the mechanism through which chronic obstructive pulmonary disease increases the risk of inguinal hernias. These alterations in elastin and connective tissues may act more generally to affect the risk of disorders of other elastic tissues, such as abdominal aortic aneurysm, for which inguinal hernia patients are at an increased risk.

While this is the first study to identify inguinal hernia susceptibility loci, previous GWASs have identified these regions as influencing a number of human phenotypes, supporting a functional role for variation in inguinal hernia loci in human traits and diseases. WT1, so named for causing Wilm's tumour, has also been associated with tuberculosis. Variants in the EFEMP1 locus have been associated with heightand forced vital capacity, and its epigenetic silencing has been associated with multiple cancer types. EBF2 has been associated with prostate cancer, though the variants identified were located proximal to those identified here. SNPs in the ADAMTS6 region are associated with differences in CCT, an anthropomorphic measure of the eye, but not conditions associated with CCT, including keratoconus or primary open-angle glaucoma. A second study also found suggestive evidence for association of this locus with osteosarcoma. The pleiotropic effect of the loci identified in this study suggests a potential shared aetiology between inguinal hernia risk and cancer, lung function and anthropomorphic traits. Given previous observational associations between inguinal hernia risk and body mass index and other connective tissue disorders, examining potential shared effects of genetic variation underlying these disorders may provide additional insight into hernia development.

### Totally extraperitoneal laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair post-radical prostatectomy [^5dc57b1a]. Surgical Endoscopy (2022). Medium credibility.

The dominance of indirect over direct inguinal hernias in the LIHR + RP group is explained by post-RP scarring, which is usually confined to the posterior wall of the inguinal canal, medial to the deep inguinal ring (Fig. 3). This scarring is an impediment to direct hernia formation, but indirect herniation into the inguinal canal is relatively unimpeded.

Although the surgical literature considers RP a major risk factor for inguinal hernia formation, in this series 18.75% of unilateral LIHR + RP patients had a previous IHR on the contralateral side, compared to 10.47% of LIHR alone, despite the two groups being matched for age and other controls. These results suggest that an underlying susceptibility to hernia development may also be a contributing factor to hernia formation post RP, contrasting with the current surgical perception.

The results of this series allowed for some comparison of the impact that the initial RP surgical technique — open, laparoscopic, or robotic — has on subsequent LIHR outcomes. Although the numbers in this study are limited, they suggest that initial RP technique does not impact on post-operative variables of awareness, restriction or recurrence in LIHR. The amount and density of scarring post RP varied from case to case, with no apparent influence by original RP technique. As in many parts of the world, robotic RP is becoming the dominant technique in Aotearoa New Zealand, but robotic RP did not appear to confer any increased ease of subsequent LIHR compared to open or laparoscopic, though the numbers in this series are very small for meaningful analysis. We acknowledge that these are findings that would need larger numbers and further research to form any definitive conclusions, but these results do seem promising that all patients who have undergone prior RP, regardless of RP type, should be considered for LIHR. To our knowledge, this is the first publication to look at the impact of initial RP type on subsequent hernia repair.

### Prospective nationwide analysis of laparoscopic versus lichtenstein repair of inguinal hernia [^3d2d4c5c]. The British Journal of Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Background

According to a Cochrane review, laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair compares favourably with open mesh repair, but few data exist from surgical practice outside departments with a special interest in hernia surgery. This study compared nationwide reoperation rates after laparoscopic and Lichtenstein repair, adjusting for factors predisposing to recurrence.

Methods

Some 3606 consecutive laparoscopic repairs were compared with 39 537 Lichtenstein repairs that were prospectively recorded in a nationwide registry between 1998 and 2003. Patients were subgrouped according to type of hernia: primary or recurrent and unilateral or bilateral. Overall reoperation rates and 95 per cent confidence intervals were calculated. Long-term reoperation rates were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.

Results

The overall reoperation rates after laparoscopic and Lichtenstein repair of unilateral primary indirect hernia (0 versus 1.0 per cent), primary direct hernia (1.1 versus 3.1 per cent), unilateral recurrent hernia (4.6 versus 4.8 per cent) and bilateral recurrent hernia (2.6 versus 7.6 per cent) did not differ. However, laparoscopic repair of a bilateral primary hernia was associated with a higher reoperation rate than Lichtenstein repair (4.8 versus 3.0 per cent) (P = 0.017).

Conclusion

Laparoscopic repair compared favourably with Lichtenstein repair for primary indirect and direct hernias, and unilateral and bilateral recurrent hernias, but was inferior for primary bilateral hernias.

### Sonographic evaluation of inguinal lesions [^d7f2a850]. Clinical Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

Abnormalities in the inguinal region are varied. The most common abnormality in the inguinal region is the hernia: direct or indirect inguinal hernia and femoral hernia. There are many hernia-mimicking lesions, such as spermatic cord hydrocele, undescended testis, hematoma, inflammation, abscess, benign or malignant tumors, metastatic or benign lymph node enlargement, round ligament varicosities or mesothelial cyst, and herniated ovary. Ultrasonography is currently the primary imaging modality used in assessing inguinal lesions and helpful for the differential diagnosis of a broad spectrum of these diseases. Familiarity with clinical setting and certain ultrasonography details will facilitate prompt and accurate diagnosis and treatment.

### A new accurate method of physical examination for differentiation of inguinal hernia types [^7dd890c6]. Surgical Endoscopy (2014). Low credibility.

Background

It is generally stated that preoperative differentiation between indirect and direct inguinal hernias by physical examination is inaccurate and irrelevant. With the expansion of the laparoscopic technique, new relevance has emerged. Laparoscopic correction of an indirect hernia is more challenging and time consuming than laparoscopic correction of a direct hernia. Preoperative knowledge concerning the type of hernia informs the laparoscopic surgeon about the required expertise and the expected operative time, and this knowledge is useful for training programs and management. The authors therefore developed a new accurate and easy method of physical examination to differentiate types of inguinal hernia. A prospective study was conducted to determine the accuracy of this new method that combines physical examination with a hand-held Doppler device (not ultrasound) to differentiate types of inguinal hernia.

Methods

This prospective diagnostics study consisted of two consecutive parts. Each part included 100 consecutive patients presenting with an inguinal hernia. The inguinal occlusion test was used to differentiate the types of inguinal hernia during physical examination in the first part of the study. A hand-held Doppler device was used for adequate localization of the epigastric vessels in addition to the occlusion test in the second part of the study. Preoperative remarks were compared with findings during laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair. The McNemar symmetry χ² test was used for statistical evaluation

Results

The first part of the study showed a preoperative accuracy of 35% for direct inguinal hernias and 86% for indirect inguinal hernias (p < 0.001). The second part of the study showed a preoperative accuracy of 79% for direct inguinal hernias and 93% for indirect inguinal hernias (p < 0.001) CONCLUSION: The inguinal occlusion test combined with the use of a handheld Doppler device is accurate in distinguishing direct and indirect inguinal hernias and provides useful management information in laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair.

### A genome-wide association study identifies four novel susceptibility loci underlying inguinal hernia [^8003794f]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

Results

Using information extracted from KPNC electronic health records (EHR), we identified hernia cases and controls among non-Hispanic white GERA participants and validated a subset of cases through chart review. In total, we identified 5,295 surgically confirmed inguinal hernia cases with male predominance (90.2%) and 67,510 controls with no known surgical or medical history of inguinal or other abdominal hernia in the GERA discovery cohort (Supplementary Table S1). Hernia repair discharge procedure codes indicated that 2,335 inguinal hernia cases had direct inguinal hernia repairs and 2,647 had indirect inguinal hernia repairs. We reviewed 230 patient charts to validate the accuracy of inguinal hernia diagnoses, and, of those, 228 (99.1%, 95% confidence interval (CI): 96.9–99.9%) were confirmed to be designated correctly as inguinal hernias of any type. Of the 118 charts reviewed specifically for accuracy of the diagnosis of direct inguinal hernia, 113 (95.7%, 95% CI: 90.3–98.6%) were found to be correctly identified. For indirect inguinal hernias, 110 of 112 chart diagnoses were found to be supported by the clinical data (98.2%, 95% CI: 93.7–99.8%). Thus, the positive predictive value of our algorithm for identifying hernia cases, as well as hernia type, was very high in this sample.

### Cost-effectiveness analysis of local, regional and general anaesthesia for inguinal hernia repair using data from a randomized clinical trial [^759c6bf5]. The British Journal of Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Inguinal hernia repair is a common operation in general surgery and can be performed under local, regional or general anaesthesia. This multicentre randomized trial was undertaken to compare the costs of the three anaesthetic methods in general surgical practice.

Methods

Between January 1999 and December 2001, 616 patients at ten hospitals who underwent primary inguinal hernia repair were randomized to local, regional or general anaesthesia. The primary endpoints were direct costs. Secondary endpoints were indirect costs and recurrence rates.

Results

Total intraoperative, as well as total early postoperative, data showed local anaesthesia to have significant cost advantages over regional and general anaesthesia (P < 0.001). The advantage was also significant for total hospital and total healthcare costs (P < 0.001), whereas there was no significant difference between regional and general anaesthesia.

Conclusion

The use of local anaesthesia for inguinal hernia repair was significantly less expensive than regional or general anaesthesia.

### Costs and quality of life after endoscopic repair of inguinal hernia vs open tension-free repair: a review [^61f0b0f5]. Surgical Endoscopy (2005). Low credibility.

Background

The ongoing debate about the relative merits of endoscopic (EH) vs open mesh herniorrhaphy (OH) prompts the need for comparisons of outcome measures other than recurrence. Therefore, we reviewed data on the costs, time to return to work, quality of life (QoL), and pain associated with EH and OH.

Methods

Studies comparing EH to OH and explicitly involving costs or QoL were identified and reviewed.

Results

Eighteen studies were included. Direct in-hospital costs were higher for unilateral EH. Direct out-of-hospital costs were lower after EH in some studies. Indirect costs were lower for EH. Total costs were higher for EH in three studies and lower in one study. With EH, QoL was better, pain was less, operating time was longer, and time return to work and other activities was shorter.

Conclusion

From a societal perspective, EH entails costs similar to OH but offers extra benefits to the patient in terms of QoL and pain.

### Cord structure within an inguinal hernia: could the ureter be involved? [^e2301d05]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

Background

Inguinal hernias are a type of groin hernia described as the protrusion of abdominal contents, such as bowel or omentum, through a weakening in Hesselbach's triangle or a congenital defect. Most commonly, an inguinal hernia contains omentum and small intestine, but rarely, it can also contain structures such as the appendix. According to one study, up to one-third of hernias are asymptomatic and even so, many patients opt for surgical fixation as the hernia can be uncomfortable and can subsequently impair some daily activities, especially for people who are athletic or conduct vigorous exercise. Surgery is recommended for patients with symptomatic inguinal hernias; however, surgery is an absolute and emergent indication for a hernia when it is incarcerated or, even worse, strangulated. Inguinal hernias, which are subtypes of groin hernias, can be direct or indirect, with the latter being the most common type in both men and women. Very rarely, retroperitoneal structures, such as urological organs, can herniate and form what is called a sliding hernia. This can present with or without lower urinary tract symptoms such as obstructive uropathy and hydronephrosis. What is even rarer is a ureter being herniated along with an inguinal hernia, with only a few cases reported in the literature.

Indirect hernias

Statements

Recommendations

Large and/or deep indirect sacs may prolong the operating time, but complete retraction is possible in almost every case. Delicate dissection and ongoing control of hemostasis do not increase the incidence of scrotal hematoseromas [44] but eliminate the formation of chronic seroma/pseudo-hydrocele. The transection of a difficult indirect sac was suggested to prevent possible damage to the spermatic cord and decrease the incidence of scrotal hematomas. Bittner et al. [2] reported low rates of orchitis (0.1%) and testicular atrophy (0.05%) despite nearly always complete reduction of the sack.

In difficult conditions, in the presence of large and deep sacs, after temporary strangulations or in complicated recurrences, the following strategy is recommended: identify the spermatic vessels far latero-caudally first before starting the dissection along the vessels towards the inguinal canal and to the top of the indirect sac. In this manner, damage to the spermatic vessels can be safely prevented [1, 4].

Quite often, substantial funicular lipomas or pre-/or retroperitoneal fat prolapse into the enlarged hernia orifices ring [45–48]. They should be retracted and eventually resected, because they may become symptomatic or mimic a recurrent hernia [49]. An overlooked lipoma is one of the known reasons for "recurrence" [50]. Although the published data provide low evidence, the search for and exclusion of such masses is integral part of the endoscopic hernia repair [51, 52].

Direct hernias

Statements

Recommendations

A prospective nonrandomized study demonstrates significantly lower incidence of postoperative seromas in the group of patients with direct hernias and transversalis fascia inversion, without increase of postoperative pain despite the use of invasive fixation with tacks to the Cooper's ligament [53]. In some expert reports, fixation with sutures is recommended as a less expensive alternative. A cautious use of superficial electrocoagulation to obliterate blood, and lymphatic vessels, also has been suggested to reduce seroma formation [1, 4].

### Lightweight versus heavyweight synthetic mesh for inguinal hernia repair [^bd343c41]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Description of the condition

Inguinal hernias make up 75% of abdominal wall hernias, with lifetime risks of 27% for men and boys and 3% for women and girls (Kingsnorth 2003). Indirect inguinal hernias (IIHs), occurring externally or laterally, surpass direct inguinal hernias (DIHs) at a ratio of roughly 2:1 (Kingsnorth 2003). Indirect inguinal hernias arising from patent processus vaginalis may be due to cryptorchidism (Favorito 2005), lack of carbachol response, absence of cholinergic receptors (Tanyel 1999), absence of myofibroblasts (Tanyel 2001), absence of apoptotic nuclei (Tanyel 2002), failure of smooth muscle apoptosis, catecholaminergic activity related to luteinising and gonadotropin‐releasing hormones, and deficiencies involving epithelial‐mesenchymal transition (Hori 2021; Momoh 1982; Somuncu 2020; Tanyel 1999; Tanyel 2001; Tanyel 2002; Tanyel 2004). Increased abdominal pressure (caused by obesity, constipation, and coughing) (Holzheimer 2005), diabetes (Holzheimer 2005), smoking (Holzheimer 2005), collagen distribution (Henriksen 2016; Koruth 2017), peritoneal dialysis (Sodo 2016), radical prostatectomy (Miyajima 2018), and family history (Burcharth 2014) are potential risk factors for groin hernias (HerniaSurge Group 2018). Inguinal hernia is usually asymptomatic but may present dull aching or dragging discomfort with a bulge in the groin, and the disappearance of the bulge in the supine position raises clinical suspicion of inguinal hernia (Shakil 2020). Clinical evaluation remains a mainstay for diagnosis; the use of ultrasound, dynamic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)/computed tomography (CT) (with Valsalva), and herniography is recommended in selective situations with obscure inguinal pain or swelling, or both (HerniaSurge Group 2018; Simons 2009). Indications for surgery include symptomatic and/or acutely irreducible inguinal hernia, with the option of watchful waiting for asymptomatic/minimally symptomatic inguinal hernia (HerniaSurge Group 2018; Miserez 2014; Simons 2009; Stabilini 2023). Surgical challenges with or without increased risk of complications for inguinal hernia repair occur in elderly people (Perez 2022), infants (Ramchandran 2020), and people with comorbidities like liver cirrhosis (Li 2020), diabetes (Hellspong 2017), chronic renal failure (Luk 2020; Sodo 2016), chronic smoking (Yergin 2023), collagen disorders (Fogel 2013), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (Dai 2019), and obesity (Chinn 2022). The risk of untreated inguinal hernia (strangulation) along with complications of inguinal hernia surgery including acute or chronic pain and recurrence needs careful assessment for each person individually (HerniaSurge Group 2018; Miserez 2014; Ramsay 2020; Simons 2009; Stabilini 2023).

### A paper-based simulation model for teaching inguinal hernia anatomy [^ca7b5cce]. World Journal of Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Inguinal hernias remain a challenging area of learning for medical students due to its relatively complex anatomy. Modern curriculum delivery methods are conventionally limited to didactic lectures and demonstration of anatomy intraoperatively. These strategies have limitations; lectures are inherently descriptive and based on 2-dimensional models, while intraoperative teaching is often unstructured and opportunistic.

Methods

A paper-based model was developed comprising three overlapping paper panels simulating the anatomical layers of the inguinal canal which can be modified readily to further simulate various hernia pathologies and their surgical repair. These models were incorporated into a timetabled structured learning session for 3 rd - and 4 th -year medical students. Learners responded to fully anonymised surveys before and after the learning session.

Findings

A total of 45 students participated in these sessions over a period of 6 months. Pre-learning session mean ratings for the learners' confidence in their understanding of the layers of the inguinal canal, identifying indirect and direct inguinal hernias and in naming the contents of the inguinal canal were 2.5, 3.3 and 2.9, while post-learning session mean ratings were 8.0, 9.4 and 8.2, respectively. Paired samples Student's t-tests for all three questions were statistically significant (p < 0.001). The mean rating for usefulness of the session was 9.6/10. Free comments from students emphasised the models' usefulness as a visual learning aid.

Discussion and Conclusion

Our novel, low-cost paper model was associated with an improvement in learners' perceived knowledge and understanding of inguinal canal anatomy and pathology.

2.5 Search Methods for Identification of Studies

We conducted searches in the following electronic databases without applying any limitations on the language of publication:
– The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) can be accessed through the Cochrane Register of Studies Online (CRSO).
– MEDLINE (ovid MEDLINE ALL from 1946 to the current daily update)
– SCOPUS

2.6 Data Collection and Analysis

After conducting bibliographic research in the predefined databases, two authors (R.C. and P.B.) independently evaluated the titles and abstracts of the selected studies. These two authors obtained the full‐text of all potentially eligible trials and independently screened these full‐texts for potential inclusion. We do not find multiple publications on the same study population.

2.7 Data Extraction and Management

Using a data extraction form developed and pilot‐tested by the authors, two authors (R.C. and M.M.) independently collected data from the included studies. For each study, the following information has been extracted: the surname of the first author and the year of publication, the country of the hospital where the study was conducted, the type of study and the number of patients included, the setting, participant characteristics (including age, type, and size of hernia), study eligibility criteria, details of the interventions (hernia repair with or without mesh), the outcomes assessed, the source of study funding, and any conflicts of interest stated by the investigators. The extracted data have been entered into the Review Manager 5.4 software, and the combined data have been analyzed to synthesize the results.

2.8 Measures of Treatment Effect

Categorical outcomes were analyzed using pooled relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), whereas continuous outcomes were analyzed using mean differences (MD) or standardized mean differences with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

### Connective tissue alteration in abdominal wall hernia [^a98caf02]. The British Journal of Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Background

The aetiology and pathogenesis of abdominal wall hernia formation is complex. Optimal treatment of hernias depends on a full understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms involved in their formation. The aim of this study was to review the literature on specific collagen alterations in abdominal wall hernia formation.

Methods

A computer-assisted search of the medical databases PubMed and Embase was performed, together with a cross-reference search of eligible papers.

Results

Fifty-two papers were included. Collagen alteration depended on the type of hernia; there were more pronounced changes in patients with a direct inguinal hernia than in those with an indirect inguinal hernia, recurrent inguinal hernia or incisional hernia. A consistent finding was a significant increase in immature type III collagen relative to the stronger type I collagen in patients with a hernia. This resulted in thinner collagen fibres with a correspondingly diminished biomechanical strength. It has been suggested that these alterations are due to variation in the synthesis, maturation or degradation of collagen by matrix metalloproteinases, in combination or alone.

Conclusion

Hernia formation and recurrence is associated with altered collagen metabolism manifested by a decreased type I:III collagen ratio.

Each of the M2 or M3 direct defects, according to the European Hernia Society (EHS), were systematically closed prior to the introduction of the prosthetic mesh [1]. Grasping and inversion of the attenuated transversalis fascia at its apex, using a laparoscopic forceps and plication of the transversalis fascia by placing a tight endoloop of polydioxanone (PDS) at its base. In total, endoloops of PDS were used to close the weakened transversalis fascia in 76 cases (30 M3, 44 M2 and two M1). Only one patient (1.3%) complained of a residual seroma formation, which was still clinically present at 3 month post-operatively, but was not symptomatic. There were only two minor post-operative complications, which occurred in the same patient and were not related to the endoloop technique. Finally, no patient complained of chronic groin pain and there was no hernia recurrence after a median follow up of 18 months.

### Comparison of hernia sac transection and full sac reduction for the treatment of inguinal hernias: a systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical trials [^1d431938]. World Journal of Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

5 Discussion

Since the advent of Bassini's inguinal hernia surgery, most surgeons have deemed it essential to ligate the sac to avert hernia recurrence, despite the related increase in postoperative pain. Our extensive literature review has identified just two published randomized meta‐analyses of RCTs particularly addressing inguinal hernia repair: Kao et al. in 2015 and Evans et al. in 2023.

All studies conducted in the adult population focused solely on indirect hernias. The dimensions of the hernias were reported exclusively by Ciftci, who used the "European Hernia Society inguinal hernia classification" (EHS). Only Othman also provided information on the dimensions of the internal ring. Othman used the Gilbert classification, which included 3 types: type 1 (normal internal ring), type 2 (internal ring ≯ 4 cm), and type 3 (internal ring ≥ 4 cm).

Within 14 research, surgeons only treated monolateral inguinal hernias, whereas only two studies documented the treatment of bilateral inguinal hernias. It is important to note that all surgical repairs of inguinal hernias were conducted as elective procedures.

All the papers, save for one, originated from the Middle East and Asia. This phenomenon may be attributed to the diminished efficacy of open tension‐free mesh surgery in the US and Europe, where minimally invasive techniques (laparoscopic and robotic) are being increasingly employed.

Concerning the documentation available for Kao, Evans, and our meta‐analyses, there were 12 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 3 controlled clinical trials (CCTs). The accessible data are considerably limited. The bulk of investigations on the adult population concentrated only on indirect, elective, unilateral mesh tension‐free inguinal hernia repair. Only two studies included bilateral inguinal hernia repair.

### A genome-wide association study identifies four novel susceptibility loci underlying inguinal hernia [^199afeb0]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

Phenotype definition

Hernia cases in the GERA cohort were identified from clinical diagnoses and surgical procedures captured in the EHR system. Hernia repair surgeries were typically associated with pre-operative and post-operative diagnoses and a detailed operative report; hernias found or repaired among inpatients also resulted in hospital discharge diagnoses. The operative reports were reviewed by hospital coders so that the corrected discharge diagnosis and procedure codes were assigned. These procedure codes usually indicated whether an inguinal hernia repair was for a direct or indirect hernia based on information contained in the operative report. These hernia diagnoses and surgical operations were recorded in the EHR system as International Classification of Disease, Ninth Revision (ICD9) diagnosis and procedure codes as well as Common Procedure Terminology, Fourth Edition (CPT4) codes. For this study, we required that inguinal hernia cases must have had a hospital discharge diagnosis of inguinal hernia or an inguinal repair surgery with a post-operative diagnosis of inguinal hernia. Diagnosis and procedure codes are listed in Supplementary Table 5.

To establish the validity of our case definition, chart review was conducted by a board-certified internist (A. A.) with the assistance of a board-certified general surgeon with special expertise in hernia repair (D.C.C.). The chart review consisted of reading the full, original narrative operative report and determining the performing surgeon's post-operative diagnosis and ensuring it was consistent with the procedure as described in the text of the operative report.

In the 23andMe cohort, case–control status was determined using the answer to one question from the 'Your Medical History' Survey: 'Have you ever had any of the following gastrointestinal surgeries (Hernia repair)?'

Consider using a biological mesh for repair when a direct suture is not feasible.

Inguinal hernia

Another degenerative disorder that appears to be caused by an abnormality in connective tissue regulation is indirect IH. Hernias are diagnosed when there is a protrusion of an organ or tissue through the fascia that normally contains it. A specific subtype of hernia known as inguinal is characterised by intra-abdominal contents protruding through the abdominal wall's inguinal canal. IHs are either direct or indirect. A direct hernia is characterised by the protrusion going forward or in anterior direction when the individual stands up. An indirect hernia is characterised by the hernia going towards the scrotum or in an obliquely downward direction. Men are at a higher risk, with the rate being 27% and 3% for women. The risk factors for IHs include a prior hernia, increased age, trauma, white ethnicity, smoking and family history are all reported risk factors for IHs.XFS and IH share the common factor of connective tissue abnormalities, elastin connective tissue, specifically as an age-related process. Both disorders are associated with family history and possible epigenetic predisposition.

### A paper-based simulation model for teaching inguinal hernia anatomy [^de76b1d7]. World Journal of Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Learning sessions

The use of these models was incorporated into a timetabled structured learning session delivered by the authors for 3 rd - and 4 th -year medical students rotating through their general surgical placement in a single teaching hospital site.

Briefly, in these learning sessions, pertinent concepts surrounding the anatomy and pathology of inguinal hernia are discussed including surface and surgical anatomy, clinical examination, investigations including radiology, different pathological variants and surgical techniques involved in the repair of inguinal hernia. These learning sessions were designed and blueprinted based on Gagne's instructional levels (Supplementary Table 1).

Students are then provided with one each of a variety of completed models of the hernia, each constructed to simulate the normal inguinal canal, various inguinal hernia pathologies and a surgically repaired inguinal hernia (Figs. 2 and 4). Students are then allowed to make a 'skin incision' on the model and dissect down, simulating a surgical exposure of the inguinal canal in the paper model to the deepest layer and discuss what they find on these models and compare it with the other models (Fig. 3).

In models with simulated pathology, students can proceed to a repair of the hernia, including dissection of the sac and reducing it, and placing and securing the 'mesh'.

Students' perceptions of their knowledge and understanding of inguinal hernia anatomy and pathology were assessed using anonymised surveys delivered immediately before and repeated immediately after the learning sessions. Additionally, students' perceptions of the usefulness of the models and the sessions were assessed in the post-session questionnaires (Fig. 5).

Fig. 5
Questionnaire items. Students answered Questions 1–3 pre-learning session; post-learning session students answered Questions 1–3 again as well as Questions 4 and 5

These questionnaires incorporated three questions asking the learners to rate their confidence in describing the layers of the inguinal canal, identifying a direct and indirect inguinal hernia and in naming the contents of the inguinal canal on a 10-point semantic differential scale. Learners were also asked to rate the usefulness of the session and provide freehand comments.

### Laparoscopic repair of inguinal hernias [^c2de25c9]. World Journal of Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Fig. 4
Mesh repair of right-sided indirect hernia

Direct hernia sacs are reduced. When the peritoneum of a direct hernia sac is being reduced, a "pseudosac" may be present, which is actually adherent transversalis fascia that invaginates into the preperitoneal space during the dissection. This layer must be separated from the true hernia sac in order for the peritoneum to be released back into the peritoneal cavity. Once the pseudosac is freed, it will typically retract anteriorly into the direct hernia defect. For direct hernias, we use a preformed, contoured mesh (e.g. Bard 3D Max Mesh or Covidien Parietex Mesh) and anchor it with two tacks to Cooper's ligament and with one tack laterally above the iliopubic tract (Fig. 5). Again, peritoneum is replaced over the mesh and anchored with tacks.

Regarding classification and risk stratification for inguinal hernia, more specifically with respect to terminology, HSG 2023 guidelines recommend to use the following terminology for groin hernias:

| **Situation** | **Guidance** |
|-|-|
|Acutely irreducible hernia|- A hernia in which the contents cannot be reduced on physical examination but were previously reducible before the acute onset of symptoms|
|Chronically irreducible hernia|- A long-standing hernia in which the contents cannot be reduced on physical examination and is not associated with sudden onset of new symptoms|
|Strangulated hernia|- A hernia with strangulated content which can only be described as such after the diagnosis is confirmed by preoperative imaging or intraoperative findings.|

### Incarcerated pediatric hernias [^335ccdda]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Indirect inguinal hernias are the most commonly incarcerated hernias in children, with a higher incidence in low birth weight and premature infants. Contralateral groin exploration to evaluate for a patent processus vaginalis or subclinical hernia is controversial, given that most never progress to clinical hernias. Most indirect inguinal hernias can be reduced nonoperatively. It is recommended to repair them in a timely fashion, even in premature infants. Laparoscopic repair of incarcerated inguinal hernia repair is considered a safe and effective alternative to conventional open herniorrhaphy. Other incarcerated pediatric hernias are extremely rare and may be managed effectively with laparoscopy.

Bittner's overall morbidity was 3.2% and decreased with experience. The scrotal subgroup had a significantly increased rate of sero-hematoma (12.5%), which mandated drainage [3]. Palanivelu also presented a small series of patients using TAPP to repair irreducible scrotal hernias with good results.

TAPP for incarcerated and strangulated inguinal hernia

Statements

Recommendations

In 2001, Leibl et al. [7] published the results of 220 prospectively studied acutely (strangulated) and chronically incarcerated inguinal hernia repairs; 194 of these repairs were accomplished via TAPP. There was no difference in operative time comparing laparoscopic and conventional repair; however, the time of operation was significantly longer compared with elective TAPP repair. Recurrence rate for TAPP repairs of incarcerated hernias were low (0.5%) and was similar to conventional open repair of incarcerated hernias. Other complications, including bleeding, mesh infection (0.1%), organ injury, and death, were similarly low or lower. The authors noted that one advantage of the TAPP technique is that it allows assessment of the viability of the bowel. The time needed for hernia repair allows time for the congested bowel to return to normal or not. A comparison to the prelaparoscopic era shows less frequent bowel resections when performing TAPP.

Resection can be performed, if needed, after repair of the hernia. Leibl's group [7] has extensive experience with TAPP repair of routine hernia, and he cautions that surgeons must be comfortable with this technique in routine hernias before attempting it on a complex incarcerated hernia. Other smaller case series and case reports have shown the viability of the TAPP technique for incarcerated hernias [7–11].

The key step to the operation is the reduction of the sac and its contents. The hernia ring can be enlarged (while preventing injury to the femoral or epigastric vessels) through a ventromedial incision in the case of direct hernias and through a ventrolateral incision in the case of indirect hernias. If resection of nonviable tissue is required, it can be done intraperitoneally (for omentum or appendix) or extraperitoneally (for small bowel) after the repair has been accomplished [8, 10, 11].

### Deficiency of epithelial-mesenchymal transition causes child indirect inguinal hernia [^4d4e2b7b]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) describes rapid changes in cellular phenotype. During EMT, epithelial cells down-modulate cell-cell adhesion, alter polarity, reorganize cytoskeleton, become isolated, motile, and resistant to anoikis. Epithelial breakdown and epithelial cell migration are the key processes involved in the obliteration of processus vaginalis. The great majority of abnormalities are because of nonobliteration or incomplete fusion of PV. We aimed to analyze the quantitative changes of epithelial genes in adult/child patients and their controls to examine differences of the genesis of these hernias. We also aimed to investigate the potential epigenetic causes of indirect inguinal hernia in adult patients.

Methods

Ten adult, ten child indirect inguinal hernia sacs and ten adult, ten child parietal peritonea were used. Hernial sac samples were obtained from indirect inguinal hernia surgeries. Peritonea of adult patients who underwent open cholecystectomy for cholelithiasis via subcostal incision were included in the study as the healthy control groups. Ages of the children were selected to be between 0 and 5 whereas the age of adults was chosen as 35–55, respectively. Total RNA isolation and cDNA synthesis were made from hernia sacs and peritoneum samples. Relative Keratin 1, Keratin 15, Filaggrin2 and STAT3 expressions were analyzed via qPCR. Indirect inguinal hernia sac cells were seeded and grown in vitro. Child diseased cells were employed in immunocytochemistry (ICC) analysis for Cytokeratin 15, Filaggrin2 and Bcl-2. Adult indirect inguinal hernia cells were examined for H3 modifications through ICC.

Results

In child indirect inguinal hernia, Keratin expressions were found higher than their controls. They were meaningfully lower than the healthy group in adult indirect inguinal hernia. Keratin 15, Keratin 1 and Filaggrin2 expressions were all correlating since they are members of related pathways. STAT3 expressions were opposite to Keratin and Filaggrin expressions suggesting that adult cells might have a switch to the mesenchymal state from the epithelial state. Adult indirect inguinal hernia samples have switched to the mesenchymal state whereas child indirect inguinal hernia samples have shown lack of transition.

Conclusion

Irregular changes of EMT associated genes act in the progression of indirect inguinal hernia. Hence, the information on the epigenetic regulation of EMT in patients with primary inguinal hernia can aid to comprehend the pathogenesis in adults and infers new therapeutic approaches for this disease.

### Guidelines for laparoscopic (TAPP) and endoscopic (TEP) treatment of inguinal hernia [International Endohernia Society (IEHS)] [^f2a7eb7a]. Surgical Endoscopy (2011). Low credibility.

It is unclear whether nonfixation increases recurrence rates, especially in large defects, or decreases chronic pain. When fixation may be indicated, it is not clear which method of fixation should be recommended. Indications for fixation may be different for totally extraperitoneal (TEP) repair and transabdominal preperitoneal (TAPP) repair or for direct and indirect hernias.

A total of 33 studies, described in 34 different articles [11–44], were included in this review. The number of patients included in each study varied widely. In most of the studies comparing fixation to nonfixation, a TEP repair was performed.

Fixation or nonfixation of the mesh

Permanent fixation using tacks, staplers, or anchors is compared with no fixation at all in terms of recurrence, acute pain, chronic pain, and costs. There are no studies comparing nonfixation with fibrin fixation for open or endoscopic hernia repair. A total of 16 studies were identified. Case series where fixation was used in all patients were not included.

Recurrence

Recurrences after fixation versus nonfixation are reported in Table 1. Five randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) [11, 15, 17–19], four case–controlled studies comparing fixation versus nonfixation [21, 26, 27, 29], and five case series on nonfixation [28, 30, 40, 42, 43] were identified.

Only one study with a 1b evidence level compared fixation versus nonfixation in TAPP repair [18] and found no significant differences in the incidence of recurrence between fixated and nonfixated repairs. However, the majority of hernia defects in this trial were smaller than 2 cm.

### Abdominal hernia… [^571a9bf1]. JAMA Network (2011). Excellent credibility.

Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below. A hernia develops when a weakness that forms in the abdominal wall enables part of the intestine or another organ to protrude through it. Among the most common are umbilical hernias that occur at the navel and inguinal hernias that are seen in the groin area. There are 2 types of inguinal hernia, indirect and direct, that may look similar but have different locations of the protruding intestine. Incisional hernias occur where an incision has been made in the abdominal wall for an operation. Symptoms The first symptom of a hernia is usually a small bulging under the skin that is generally painless but may produce discomfort and get larger during strenuous activities or coughing. At this stage, the hernia is reducible because its contents can be pushed back into the abdomen. However, if the hernia grows, it may become incarcerated.

If blood stops flowing through an incarcerated bowel, this results in strangulation, which is accompanied by pain, often with nausea, vomiting, or constipation. Risk factors Family history of hernia Being male Obesity Pregnancy Weight lifting, coughing, straining during bowel movement Cystic fibrosis and chronic lung infections Previous abdominal surgery Complications. A hernia may result in entrapment of other organs or nerves, producing constipation or problems with urination or sexual function. A strangulated hernia is a surgical emergency because part of the bowel may become necrotic, resulting in life-threatening peritonitis needing surgical removal of part of the bowel. If you have a hernia and significant abdominal pain, pain over the hernia, or nausea or vomiting, you should seek medical care immediately. The operation to repair a hernia is called a herniorrhaphy.

When the gap is large, a plastic mesh may be used for reinforcement of muscles of the abdominal wall. Use of mesh reduces the risk of the hernia recurring, but the mesh material can become infected. In some cases, hernia repairs may be performed laparoscopically, although this approach has not been shown to be better than traditional open operations.

### Laparoscopic versus open inguinal hernia repair [^7a77e6a7]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Inguinal hernias are common, with a lifetime risk of 27% in men and 3% in women. Inguinal hernia repair is one of the most common operations in general surgery. Despite more than 200 years of experience, the optimal surgical approach to inguinal hernia remains controversial. Surgeons and patients face many decisions when it comes to inguinal hernias: repair or no repair, mesh or no mesh, what kind of mesh, open or laparoscopic, extraperitoneal or transabdominal, and so forth. Inguinal hernia repairs have morbidity and recurrence rates that are not inconsequential. The search for the gold standard of repair continues.

### Assessment and management of inguinal hernias in children [^241cf79c]. Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

American Academy of Pediatrics clinical report — pediatric inguinal hernias — notes that inguinal hernia repair is one of the most commonly performed surgical procedures in children and that pediatric inguinal hernias are generally indirect, characterized by protrusion of intraabdominal contents through a patent processus vaginalis (PPV). The incidence of inguinal hernias is approximately 8 to 50 per 1000 live births in term infants, increasing to nearly 20% in extremely low birth weight (< 1000 g) infants. The risk of an incarcerated inguinal hernia in children is estimated to be 4%, with the highest risk (8%) noted in infants; consequently, they are commonly repaired shortly after diagnosis. The report reviews the embryology, pathophysiology, and natural history of PPV and the contemporary evaluation and treatment of pediatric hernias, with special attention to the risks of general anesthetic in very young children.

### Midline incisional hernia guidelines: the European hernia society [^6e8e6ca7]. The British Journal of Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Evidence for Good Practice Statement A

The use of ERAS protocols in incisional hernia repair is promising. Two systematic reviews and meta-analyses evaluating the use of ERAS in complex abdominal wall reconstruction have been published recently. Given that the focus of these studies was complex incisional hernias and not more simple midline hernias (the focus of these guidelines) the evidence is indirect. The first publication, by Sartori et al. includes five retrospective cohort papers (search up to April 2020). The length of hospital stay was significantly lower in the ERAS group (albeit only 0.6 days) without increasing the overall postoperative morbidity and readmission rate. However, according to GRADE criteria, the quality of evidence was very low to low for all endpoints. In addition, there was large heterogeneity with respect to the complexity of the surgery performed (for example component separation techniques in 29–100 per cent of the patients), as well as the ERAS protocols across the different studies. The authors also report that it is unclear whether any change in the discharge criteria after the introduction of an ERAS pathway may have changed the length of stay in the included studies. Two months later, another meta-analysis on the same topic included four of the same papers (search up to end of November 2019), together with one additional paper not included in the first meta-analysis. The conclusions were similar with a decreased length of stay in the ERAS group of 0.89 days.

Considering the methodological aspects and the fact that the type of abdominal wall defects included in the various studies is not representative for the patient population of the authors' guidelines, the panel found only indirect evidence, which is not sufficient to give a clinical recommendation.

It thus suggests that ERAS protocols for non-complex incisional hernia repair should be used in experimental and cohort studies to investigate their effectiveness in this patient group.

Key Question 12: Should prophylactic antibiotics be used in the elective repair of incisional hernia in adult patients?

Recommendation A: For patients having repair of a midline incisional hernia, the guidelines panel suggests a single prophylactic dose of antibiotic (according to local hospital policy). If the operation is longer than 4 h, the guidelines panel suggests a second prophylactic dose, depending on the antibiotic used, amount of blood loss, and surgical approach (conditional recommendation, very low certainty evidence).

The need for prophylactic antibiotics during hernia repair varies between institutions and cases, dependent upon both patient-specific and procedure-specific risk factors. This KQ explores the evidence for their use.

Figure 12
Original illustration of variations in testicular anatomy by the first author. (A) Normal testicle with obliterated processus vaginalis. (B) Patent processus vaginalis with communicating hydrocele. (C) Indirect hernia caused by patent processus vaginalis. This hernia travels through both the deep and superficial inguinal rings. (D) Direct hernia caused by weakness in the transversalis fascia. This hernia travels through the superficial ring only and lies medial to the inferior epigastric vessels, a key differentiation between indirect and direct hernias.

Figure 13
Original illustration of spigelian hernia by the first author. The spigelian hernia is identified at the weakness of the fascia located at the semilunar line. The transversus abdominis and external oblique are resected in this illustration.

The diagnosis proved challenging, as the primary surgeon did palpate a silk glove sign, a classic finding associated with an inguinal hernia in an infant (figure 14). On palpation of the skin over the pubic tubercle, the processus vaginalis feels like two pieces of silk being rubbed together by the examiner's index finger. Furthermore, the ultrasound suggested an inguinal hernia with bowel present and erroneously confirmed the testicle in the inguinal canal. During the first examination, there was no evidence of a ventral hernia. The re-presentation with an abdominal wall hernia led the primary surgeon to research paediatric spigelian hernias and discovered the reports of a possible spigelian hernia-cryptorchidism syndrome in children. The lesson to the surgeon was to always be on guard for premature diagnostic closure and maintain a questioning mindset when examining a patient, even in the setting of such a routine presumed diagnosis. Collaborative, shared decision making with the family was essential to address the risks, benefits and alternatives of surgery.

### Metalloproteinases and their inhibitors in patients with inguinal hernia [^9bc958b1]. World Journal of Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Aim

The aim of this prospective study is to investigate if there is a relationship between inguinal hernia, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs).

Materials and Methods

This case control study was performed on patients admitted to the general surgery department of Erzincan University Hospital. Four groups were created: control, indirect hernia, direct hernia, and bilateral hernia. All groups were comprised of 11 patients. Serum and tissue levels of MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-9, MMP-13, TIMP-1, TIMP-2, TIMP-3, and hydroxyproline were evaluated.

Results

MMPs values were significantly high at hernia groups, especially at bilateral hernia group (p < 0.05), whereas TIMPs values were significantly low at bilateral hernia group (p < 0.05). MMPs values were increasing at hernia groups in an order as control, indirect, direct, and bilateral. TIMPs values were decreasing at hernia groups in an order as control, indirect, direct, and bilateral.

Conclusion

Increased levels of MMP-1-2-9-13 and decreased levels of TIMP-1-2-3 may have played role in the formation of inguinal hernia. Hernia is not only a local defect, but a reflection of systemic disease. This is even more significant for bilateral hernias.

### The diagnosis and classification of inguinal and femoral hernia on multisection spiral CT [^d1e314b5]. Clinical Radiology (2008). Low credibility.

Aim

To assess the contribution of high-quality multiplanar reconstructions of the groin from multisection computed tomography (CT) to the accurate diagnosis of inguinal and femoral hernias.

Materials and Methods

Twenty-eight patients who had undergone both a contrast-enhanced CT and a herniorrhaphy were identified from hospital records. Seventeen were excluded, as the images did not include the groin area. The remaining 11 images were re evaluated on a workstation without knowledge of the surgical findings and the hernias were identified and classified using the axial data and coronal and sagittal reconstructions. Anatomical structures and radiological details that hindered or aided this classification were recorded.

Results

Hernias were identified in nine out of the 11 patients. Of the seven inguinal hernias, six were identified with the correct side recorded in each case. Of the four patients with surgical data that distinguished direct from indirect inguinal hernias, the correct diagnosis was provided in all cases using CT. Of the four patients with a femoral hernia CT was used to correctly classify three. Among the three available planes, the axial was particularly poor for the identification of the inguinal ligament compared with the other planes. In contrast, the coronal views were very useful in the evaluation of femoral hernias.

Conclusions

The high-resolution coronal and sagittal images available from multisection CT now permit the accurate diagnosis of groin hernias. Using simple anatomical criteria, direct and indirect inguinal hernias and femoral hernias can be reliably distinguished, abolishing the need for surrogate markers, which was hitherto necessary.

### Matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-2) and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMP-2) in patients with inguinal hernias [^082a83ce]. World Journal of Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The development of inguinal hernia might be related with collagen metabolism, which was regulated by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs). The aim of this study was to evaluate the mRNA and protein expression levels of MMP-2 and TIMP-2 in anterior rectus sheath fascia to investigate the function of them in inguinal hernia formation.

Methods

The study enrolled 48 primary inguinal hernia patients: 32 participants had indirect inguinal hernia and 16 patients suffered direct inguinal hernia. Specimens were taken from the anterior rectus sheath fascia. The amounts of MMP-2 mRNA and TIMP-2 mRNA were evaluated by real-time fluorescence quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and immunohistochemistry was performed to assess the protein expression of them.

Results

The mRNA and protein expression levels of MMP-2 in direct group were significantly higher than those of control group (P < 0.05) and indirect group (P < 0.05), while the expression levels of TIMP-2 in direct group were significantly lower than those of control group (P < 0.05) and indirect group (P < 0.05). The ratio of MMP-2 mRNA/TIMP-2 mRNA in direct group was significantly higher than that of control group (P < 0.05) and indirect group (P < 0.05), and the ratio of indirect group was significantly higher than that of control group (P < 0.05). According to receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, MMP-2/TIMP-2 can diagnose direct hernia from controls with area under the curve (AUC) of 0.950 and indirect hernia with AUC of 0.730 effectively.

Conclusions

Elevated level of MMP-2 and decreased level of TIMP-2 may play a role in direct inguinal hernia development. The ratio of MMP-2/TIMP-2 may be useful in identification of direct hernia.

### Utilization of laparoscopic and open inguinal hernia repair at a large hernia center in China: a single-center observational study [^7e009eb1]. Surgical Endoscopy (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The utilization of laparoscopic and open inguinal hernia repair in China remains unclear. We aim to investigate the rates of laparoscopic and open inguinal hernia repairs and its associated factors at a large hernia center.

Methods

Data were obtained from the front sheet of medical records of Beijing Chaoyang hospital. Adult inguinal hernia inpatients who underwent hernia repairs between 2013 and 2020 were included. We calculated the overall rates of laparoscopic and open inguinal hernia repairs and compared the rate of laparoscopic repairs between different sex, age groups, types, and sides of inguinal hernias. Multivariable logistic regression was used to examine factors associated with the rate of laparoscopic repairs.

Results

14,481 inpatients with inguinal hernia were included. 91.78% were male, 75.43% were more than 50 years, 75.20% were unilateral inguinal hernia, and 64.57% were indirect inguinal hernia. Overall, 49.47% underwent laparoscopic repairs and 50.53% underwent open repairs. Women had lower rate of laparoscopic repair than men, especially in those with unilateral hernias. Bilateral and direct inguinal hernia had higher rates of laparoscopic repair than unilateral and indirect inguinal hernia. Multivariable logistic regression showed that inpatients who were women, > 70 years, pantaloon inguinal hernia, with obstruction, and more comorbidities were less likely to have laparoscopic repairs.

Conclusion

Around 50% of inguinal hernia patients at a large hernia center underwent laparoscopic repairs, which was more commonly performed in male, young, bilateral inguinal hernia, and inpatients without comorbidities. More efforts were needed to increase the safe and effective laparoscopic utilization among female patients with inguinal hernias.

### The tip of the iceberg: lipomatous tumours presenting as abdominal or pelvic wall hernias [^44381d31]. Insights Into Imaging (2019). Medium credibility.

Types of hernias

Direct inguinal hernia

Direct inguinal hernias are often secondary to weakness of the transversalis fascia. They are located medial to the inferior epigastric vessels and occur more in men than in women, often bilaterally.

Indirect inguinal hernia

Indirect inguinal hernias are the most common type of abdominal wall hernias. These hernias are located lateral to the inferior epigastric vessels and result from a patent processus vaginalis. This results in herniation along the spermatic cord into the scrotum in men whilst in women this follows the round ligament into the labia majora.

Spigelian hernia

The linea semilunaris is a fibrous union of the rectus sheath with the aponeuroses of the transverse and oblique abdominal muscles extending from the level of the ninth costal cartilage to the symphysis pubis. A Spigelian hernia is the result of a defect in the linea semilunaris.

Rectus divarication

Also known as separation of the rectus abdominis muscles (along the length of the linea alba), this entity occurs most commonly in elderly multiparous women.

Lumbar hernia

Lumbar hernias occur through defects in the lumbar muscles or the posterior transversalis or lumbodorsal fascia. The diffuse type of lumbar hernia is often iatrogenic and may occur following surgical incisions.

Sciatic hernia

Sciatic hernias are rare and can occur in the greater or lesser sciatic foramina, the majority are found in elderly women. About one-third of patients present with a reducible gluteal mass; other symptoms are non-specific abdominal or pelvic pain. CT can result in a false negative scan, as this is performed with the patient in supine position potentially compressing the lesion. If the CT is negative in the presence of a high clinical suspicion, ultrasound has been proposed as an alternative modality as it adds a dynamic component to the assessment with the Valsalva manoeuvre and the patient in standing position. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the modality of choice to evaluate the sciatic nerve in cases of sciatic hernia.

### Groin hernia subtypes are associated in patients with bilateral hernias: a 14-year nationwide epidemiologic study [^90341a7a]. Surgical Endoscopy (2015). Low credibility.

Background

To investigate the relation between groin hernia subtypes in patients operated for bilateral hernias.

Methods

With data from the Danish Hernia Database, we identified all patients operated for primary groin hernias from 1998 to 2012. Within this cohort all patients that were bilaterally operated were analyzed. Risk factors for bilateral groin hernia operation as well as the relationship between groin hernia subtypes bilaterally, were analyzed using multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis and Kappa statistics.

Results

A total of 108, 775 persons with primary groin hernia repair (89.9% males) were registered, and of those were 12,041 persons operated bilaterally (94.9% males). Females and males operated for a unilaterally direct inguinal hernia (DIH) had increased Hazard Ratios (HR) of 3.85 (CI 95% 2.14–6.19) and 4.46 (CI 95% 2.57–7.88) of being contralaterally operated for a DIH. Females and males operated for a unilaterally indirect inguinal hernia (IIH) had HRs of 6.93 (CI 95% 3.66–13.11) and 1.89 (CI95% 1.24–2.88) for being contralaterally operated for an IIH. The same tendency was seen for femoral hernias.

Conclusions

All hernia subtypes were bilaterally associated in both genders and the hernia subtypes could be localized manifestations of generalized conditions or inheritable traits instead of localized defects.

### Penetrating versus non-penetrating mesh fixation in laparoscopic groin hernia repair [^6684532b]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Description of the condition

It is estimated that surgeons worldwide repair more than 20 million groin hernias each year, making it one of the most common surgical procedures. Groin hernia is mainly a clinical diagnosis based on the patient's history and the clinical examination. A groin hernia is a condition where a bulge appears in the groin area due to protrusion of a hernia sac (peritoneum) through a defect in the abdominal wall. The hernia sac contains preperitoneal fat, intestines, and/or other abdominal organs. Groin hernias can often be manually reduced back into the abdominal cavity; otherwise, they are named irreducible hernias. Individuals with an irreducible hernia who also experience pain have signs of a compromised blood supply, indicating a strangulated hernia that requires acute surgery.

Groin hernias comprise femoral and inguinal hernias, and inguinal hernias can further be subdivided into lateral/indirect and medial/direct hernias. Around 96% of repaired groin hernias are inguinal hernias and 4% are femoral hernias, and groin hernia repairs peak when patients are around 75 to 80 years old. Inguinal hernia repairs are also most frequent in both sexes, constituting 99% of groin hernia repairs in men and 78% in women. However, since 27% of men and 3% of women undergo inguinal hernia repair at some point in their lives, most inguinal hernia repairs are performed on men. Regarding femoral hernias, slightly more repairs are performed in women than in men, but 22% of groin hernia repairs in women are for a femoral hernia, while this is only the case in 1% of men.

### Acute direct inguinal hernia resulting from blunt abdominal trauma: case report [^b20ff55d]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Here we discuss the first reported case of the formation and successful repair of an acute direct inguinal hernia resulting from blunt abdominal trauma where the inguinal canal was completely obliterated causing bowel to lie immediately beneath an attenuated external oblique aponeurosis. Technically there was no direct or indirect hernia as there was no inguinal canal. Traumatic injuries do not respect abdominal planes; normal anatomy is frequently distorted. Delayed repair afforded the resolution of haematoma and oedema that may have resulted in more challenging surgery.

As the defect was unilateral and the procedure was exploratory in the first instance an open approach was undertaken. The size of the defect afforded easy inspection of the peritoneal cavity for visceral injury. As primary repair was feasible without tension this was undertaken by reconstructing the inguinal region in layers. An alternative technique of repair would have been a laparoscopic intraperitoneal approach rather than extraperitoneal due to the location of abdominal viscera beneath the skin and obliteration of the abdominal wall in the right inguinal region. After reduction of the abdominal viscera composite mesh would be fixed to edges of the defect rather than direct suture of the cranial and caudal borders of the defect (edge of abdominal wall lined by peritoneum and pubic bone, respectively) together.

### Acute direct inguinal hernia resulting from blunt abdominal trauma: case report [^7e23ab08]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Blunt abdominal trauma may cause both crush and shearing effects on healthy abdominal wall and viscera. Acute onset indirect inguinal hernia with testicular dislocation after blunt trauma is rarely reported, but, to our knowledge, a case resulting in complete obliteration of the inguinal canal with direct herniation of the abdominal viscera has not been documented.

The inguinal canal extends from the anterior superior iliac spine to the pubic tubercle. A defect in the posterior wall results in a direct hernia. In our case, all boundaries of the inguinal canal including the floor, posterior, inferior, medial walls and deep and superficial rings were obliterated causing traumatic herniation of the terminal ileum and caecum beneath an attenuated external oblique aponeurosis.

We describe the timely reconstruction of the abdominal wall in the inguinal region and the importance of the restoration of normal anatomy with definitive repair after resolution of swelling and haematoma.

### If laparoscopic technique can be used for treatment of acutely incarcerated / strangulated inguinal hernia? [^0ed4b4e1]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Methods

We retrospectively reviewed 94 patients with acutely incarcerated/strangulated inguinal hernias who were treated by emergency TAPP from January 2017 to December 2019 at our hospital (Department of Hernia and Abdominal Wall Surgery, Beijing Chaoyang Hospital, Capital Medical University). The patients' characteristics, operative details, duration of hospital stay, incidence of complications, mortality, and recurrence were reviewed.

The criteria for evaluating the feasibility of the laparoscopic technique were the mean operative time, ability to reduce the hernia, rate of conversion to open surgery, and diagnostic rate of contralateral inguinal hernia. The criteria for evaluating the safety of the laparoscopic technique were the mean hospital stay, mortality, morbidity of complications, and hernia recurrence rate.

The inclusion criteria were adult patients with incarcerated/strangulated inguinal hernias, no previous severe abdominal surgery, no abdominal wall infection, no severe cardiopulmonary function diseases, and a body condition fit for general anesthesia. The exclusion criteria were patients with contraindications for general anesthesia, signs of peritonitis, a definitive diagnosis of bowel perforation before surgery, and severe bowel distension preventing the use of a laparoscopic technique.

Surgical technique

All operations were performed by a single surgeon, and TAPP repair was performed in all cases. After inducing general anesthesia, pneumoperitoneum was established with a Veress needle up to 12 to 14 mmHg. A 10-mm trocar was inserted into the abdominal cavity through the incision just below the umbilicus. A 30° video camera was placed into the abdominal cavity through the 10-mm trocar. Under laparoscopic visualization, two 5-mm trocars were placed at each midclavicular line (1 or 2 cm under the umbilicus). First, we detected the inguinal region and evaluated the hernia contents. The next step was hernia reduction, which involved some technical difficulties. Hernia reduction might be assisted by general anesthesia. If direct traction failed, manual pressure to inguinal region from outside could be applied by an assistant. If the above methods failed, enlargement of the hernia ring with an electronic hook became necessary. The hernia ring was incised ventrolaterally for indirect hernias and ventromedially for direct hernias. After successful reduction, the vitality of the hernia content could be clearly detected. Standard TAPP repair was then performed. Severe incarcerated bowel was detected again in the last step, and bowel resection was performed endoscopically if necessary. We converted to open surgery in patients with bowel perforation. Any accompanying contralateral inguinal hernias were simultaneously repaired by the TAPP approach.

### Is unilateral laparoscopic TEP inguinal hernia repair a job half done? The case for bilateral repair [^e6f6a80d]. Surgical Endoscopy (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

Bilateral laparoscopic totally extraperitoneal (TEP) repair of unilateral hernia is conspicuous in published literature by its absence. There are no studies or data on the feasibility, advantages or disadvantages of bilateral repair in all cases or in any subset of patients with unilateral primary inguinal hernia. The objective of this study is to investigate the feasibility of bilateral laparoscopic exploration for all unilateral cases followed by laparoscopic TEP in all cases and to compare complications, recurrence rates, postoperative pain, patient satisfaction, and return to work retrospectively with a similar number of age-matched retrospective controls.

Method

One hundred fifty TEP operations were performed in 75 patients (group A) prospectively and were compared with 75 unilateral TEP operations (group B) in age-matched controls done previously by the same surgeon. All cases were performed under general anesthesia, and TEP repair was performed using three midline ports. All uncomplicated patients were discharged at 24 h, in keeping with departmental policy.

Results

Of 75 patients (group A), 25 (33.3%) were clinically diagnosed with bilateral hernia and the rest (50, 66.66%) with unilateral hernia. The distribution of the 25 bilateral cases was 11 bilateral direct and 14 bilateral indirect inguinal hernias. The distribution of the 75 age-matched controls (group B) was all unilateral hernia, of which 47 were right-sided and 28 were left-sided. There were 23 direct hernias and 52 indirect hernias among the control group. The mean operative time for all 150 cases was 76.66 ± 15.92 min. The operative time in the control group (unilateral hernias) was 66.16 ± 12.44 min, whereas the operative time in the test group (bilateral repair) was 87.2 ± 11.32 min. The operative time in the bilateral group was significantly higher, by 21.04 min or 31.88% (p = 0.000). The operative time in the true unilateral group was 82.45 ± 9.38 min, whereas the operative time in the former group [occult contralateral hernias (OCHs) + bilateral hernias] was 91.35 ± 11.95 min, which is a statistically significant difference (p = 0.0015). Occult hernia was seen in a total of 15 cases, of which 13 were OCHs (26%) and 2 were occult ipsilateral hernias (OIH). The mean operative time in the OCH cases was 81.46 ± 7.9 min, whereas in those without OCH it was 82.45 ± 9.38 min, which is not a statistically significant difference (p = 0.46). Regarding complications, there were no cases of seroma, hematoma, wound infection, visceral injury or postoperative neuralgia in either group A or B. On statistical analysis, visual analog score (VAS)-measured pain score, at 12 h only, was significantly higher in the unilateral repair group as compared with the bilateral TEP group; VAS scores at all other times were not statistically significantly different between the two groups. The average time of return to light routine or activities of daily living was 1 day in group A, whereas in group B it was 1.91 days (range 1–3 days), which is a statistically significant difference (p = 0.000). There was one case of recurrence in this study, in a left-sided hernia in group A, over a follow-up period of 60–72 (mean 66) months; all patients reported for follow-up by office visit or correspondence until 2 years, and two patients were lost to follow-up after 2 years. In group B, there was no recurrence over a follow-up period of 72–84 months, with three patients lost to follow-up after 3 years.

Conclusion

In the present study bilateral TEP was performed in three types of patients: those with clinically bilateral hernias, those with clinically unilateral hernia but with an OCH, and in truly unilateral hernias. All of these were compared with unilateral TEPs in clinically unilateral hernias, and we found no significant increase in morbidity, pain, recurrence or complications in bilateral repairs. Convalescence from surgery, as determined by return to activities of daily living and return to work parameters, was also comparable. Surgeons experienced in laparoscopic TEP, in high-volume centers, can provide bilateral repairs in patients with inguinal hernia, bearing in mind its advantages and comparable morbidity. We also feel that, in elective repair of inguinal hernia, the patient should be given the option of bilateral repair. Bilateral repair does not add to the risk of surgery in experienced hands and we strongly feel that unilateral TEP is actually a job half done.

### Inguinal hernias: diagnosis and management… [^6b07e0bd]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

Abdominal contents becoming trapped within the hernial sac, leading to incarceration, is a risk of watchful waiting. Over time, this can impede the blood flow in the incarcerated hernial contents. Richter hernia, a rare complication with a high mortality rate, occurs when part of the intestinal circumference is entrapped and strangulated in the hernial sac. Watchful waiting is also commonly used in pregnant patients because groin swelling can be caused by self-limited round ligament varicosities. 23 Color flow Doppler imaging can be used to distinguish between a true hernia and round ligament varicosities. In a 2017 cohort study of 20, 714 pregnant patients, only 25 had inguinal hernias and none underwent elective or emergency hernia repair during pregnancy. In 10 patients, the groin bulge disappeared spontaneously after delivery.

24 For reducible inguinal hernias in pregnant patients, it seems safe and cost-effective to wait until after delivery to attempt repair. Although nonmesh techniques have fallen out of favor in the United States, they are still acceptable internationally. Mesh techniques are strongly recommended because of lower recurrence rates compared with nonmesh techniques. 19 If mesh is unavailable, a 2009 European guideline suggests that an open anterior nonmesh technique is most favorable. 19, 25. The use of laparoscopic techniques has been shown to be superior to tension-free mesh repair for postoperative pain outcomes. 19 Common laparoscopic techniques include the total extraperitoneal approach and transabdominal preperitoneal approach. In both of these approaches, mesh is placed in the preperitoneal space, but access starts at different anatomic points. Laparoscopic repair of groin hernias is preferred over open repair because of better recovery outcomes.

26–29 Guidelines specifically recommend laparoscopic approaches in women to decrease the risk of chronic pain and avoid missing femoral hernias. Laparoscopic approaches can also be used in patients with previous hernias that were repaired with an open approach to avoid significant scar tissue. 19 A Cochrane review comparing open and laparoscopic repair found that laparoscopic repair took longer and was associated with a higher rate of vascular, colonic, or bladder injury; however, overall, laparoscopic surgery was associated with shorter recovery, earlier resumption of activities of daily living, less pain, and lower recurrence rates. 29.

### Assessment and management of inguinal hernias in children [^16b7d528]. Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Inguinal hernias in children — key summary statements are as follows: Inguinal hernias are a common pediatric surgical condition, and the risk of incarceration drives the preference for and timing of surgical repair. In preterm infants, repair can be safely considered after discharge from the NICU. Ideally, pediatric surgical specialists, pediatric urologists, or general surgeons with a significant yearly case volume should repair pediatric inguinal hernias to achieve optimal outcomes. The laparoscopic approach appears to be gaining popularity and is at least as effective as, if not better than, traditional open high ligation. In the absence of strong data for or against repair of incidentally discovered contralateral patent processus vaginalis (PPV), family values related to the risks and benefits of each approach from a nuanced preoperative discussion should be considered. Laparoscopy appears to be a feasible alternative in managing recurrent hernias. There is no conclusive evidence to suggest that exposure to a single relatively short duration of anesthetic has adverse effects on neurodevelopmental outcomes in otherwise healthy children. Study authors recommended cardiorespiratory monitoring in all former preterm infants less than 60 weeks of corrected gestational age, and institutional policies should be developed outlining the need and duration of observation after anesthesia in former preterm infants.

### Pediatric hernias [^e1f22752]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Almost all groin hernias in children are indirect inguinal hernias and occur as a result of incomplete closure of the processus vaginalis. The treatment is repair by high ligation of the hernia sac, which can be done by an open or laparoscopic technique. The contralateral side can be explored by laparoscopy or left alone; open exploration is no longer indicated due to the potential risk of infertility. Umbilical hernias are common in infants but usually close with time. Surgery is indicated if the umbilical hernia is symptomatic or if the fascial defect fails to decrease in size over time.

Inguinal hernia

Inguinal hernia is the commonest type of abdominal wall hernia (up to 80%). They are most often acquired and have a male predominance with M:F ratio of upto 7:1. Table 5 lists some other differentials for a mass in the inguinal canal.

Table 5
Differentials for inguinal canal mass that may be seen on prostate MRI

Inguinal hernias may be direct or indirect, with indirect being five times more common. Direct hernias by contrast often descend through a weakened defect in the abdominal wall transversalis fascia within the Hesselbach triangle which is bordered by the rectus abdominis muscle medially, inferior epigastric vessels superolaterally and the inguinal ligament inferiorly. Hence, direct inguinal hernias occur inferomedial to the inferior epigastric vessels. Indirect hernias are more common, pass through the deep inguinal ring, usually anterior to the spermatic cord and lateral to the inferior epigastric vessels and Hesselbach triangle.

In men, the contents of the hernia can extend through the superficial ring into the scrotum, while in women, they can follow the round ligament into the labia majora. Hernias may contain intra-abdominal fat or bowel, either small bowel or large bowel or rarely reproductive organs. When containing bowel the hernias may become obstructed in which case the bowel loops will become distended with surrounding fat stranding and fluid. Although diagnosis is usually made based on clinical examination, ultrasound and/ or CT, MRI can help identify occult inguinal hernia, although this is not standard practice given the associated increased and often unnecessary costs.

Occasionally evidence of prior mesh repair or plugs may be seen. A mesh often appears as low signal on T1/T2 with adjacent susceptibility artefact. Plugs often appear as rounded masses at the opening of the internal ring, and they often appear low signal on T1 and T2 but depending on surrounding inflammatory response and timing of the operation may have mixed signal intensities (Fig. 20).

TAPP and TEP repair and the occult synchronous hernias.

Statements

Recommendations

One problem associated with the repair of the recurrent inguinal hernia repair is the missed synchronous hernia [64]. Felix et al. [33] found an occult femoral hernia incidence of 9% in his 1996 series of laparoscopic repair of recurrent inguinal hernia. Mikkelsen et al. found the risk of femoral hernia to be 15 times higher after inguinal hernia repair than in the general population, and Chan believes prior inguinal hernia repair may precipitate femoral hernia [65, 66]. He found that 50.9% of his series of 225 femoral hernia repairs had concurrent inguinal hernia and 18.2% had prior groin hernia repair. Laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair provides the benefit of a panoramic view of the all the potential hernia spaces: direct and indirect, femoral, and obturator hernias. TAPP and TEP therefore address the missed femoral and concomitant ipsilateral hernias. Furthermore, TAPP enables rapid evaluation of contralateral hernias (see Chap. 2, Kukleta). The laparoscopic approach obliterates these associated occult synchronous or potential hernias utilizing a single repair without any particular modification to the technique. There has been a general agreement that in every case of hernia repair a careful complete dissection of the whole ipsilateral pelvic floor is mandatory.

Construction of the inguinal hernia model. a and b Model scaled to and printed on a A4-sized paper being cut into the 4 individual panels with a pair of scissors. The 4 panels are labelled back (serves as back panel of model and contains instructions on how to construct the model, Panel 1 demonstrating the skin with relevant surface anatomy, Panel 2, the external oblique fascia layer and the inguinal ligament with the superficial inguinal ring as a natural defect in this layer and Panel 3 showing the deep inguinal ring and its important anatomical relationships. c and d Superficial ring being cut out from Panel 2. e, f and g Deep inguinal ring being cut out and simulation of weakness in Hesselbach's triangle by cutting out the area. h and i Introduction of swabs through the deep inguinal ring in Panel 3 from the front and back, respectively, to simulate an indirect inguinal hernia sac. j Stapling of a plastic tube at the top left corner, sandwiched between Panel 3 and the back panel, simulating the spermatic cord or round ligament. The tube is then fed through the deep inguinal ring. k Stapling of Panel 2 to the model. The tube is fed through the superficial inguinal ring. l Stapling of Panel 1 to the model. Stapling all four corners completes the model
