## Question

So explain the bioavailability of furosemide

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the bioavailability of furosemide — specifically, how it differs across administration routes, how patient factors affect absorption, and what the clinical implications are for practice, including considerations of alternatives like subcutaneous administration and torsemide. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core pharmacokinetic definitions and the reference standard (IV). Then, I should verify oral bioavailability in healthy subjects and quantify variability. Next, I will examine how heart failure and edematous states alter absorption. After that, I should review subcutaneous furosemide data and confirm bioequivalence to IV. Then, I will compare with torsemide and bumetanide. Finally, I will translate this into practical dosing strategies, monitoring, and a concise clinical summary with caveats and evidence strength.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacokinetic framework and the reference standard. Bioavailability is the fraction of an administered dose that reaches systemic circulation intact, and for furosemide the intravenous route serves as the 100% reference because it bypasses absorption variability. The FDA label states that in fasted healthy men, mean oral bioavailability is about 64% for tablets and 60% for oral solution relative to IV, with a terminal half-life around 2 hours, which anchors the comparison I will use throughout this discussion [^113pfaM2] [^114BbqYW] [^111GzRFc].

> Wait, let me verify the oral absorption characteristics and variability before drawing conclusions. The oral solution reaches a median Tmax around 50 minutes and tablets around 87 minutes, yet AUCs are similar between oral formulations, indicating comparable overall exposure but different absorption kinetics. Importantly, interindividual variability is wide, with reports ranging from below 20% to over 90% in some series, which is clinically meaningful when trying to predict response from a fixed oral dose [^113pfaM2] [^115JHe11].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about oral therapy in heart failure without checking disease-specific PK. In decompensated heart failure and other edematous states, gut edema, delayed gastric emptying, and altered splanchnic perfusion reduce and make oral furosemide absorption highly erratic; observational and pathophysiology reviews describe average oral bioavailability around 50% with marked interpatient variability, and guidelines acknowledge that impaired absorption contributes to diuretic resistance, prompting escalation to IV therapy when congestion limits oral uptake [^116BRcXA] [^111pjgDm] [^116s4jCZ].

> I need to check the subcutaneous route next, because it is often proposed as an outpatient "IV-like" alternative. Multiple studies and the FDA label for the buffered SC formulation (Furoscix) demonstrate near-complete bioavailability of approximately 99.6% relative to IV, with therapeutic plasma levels achieved within about 30–60 minutes and sustained over several hours; clinically, SC produces diuresis and natriuresis comparable to IV dosing, supporting its role when reliable absorption is critical outside the hospital [^115wzdcU] [^111UM5Zg] [^114DmBbk] [^116ccGNa].

> Let me consider comparative agents, especially torsemide, which is frequently cited for superior PK. Torsemide has high and more predictable oral bioavailability (about 80–90%) and a longer half-life, which theoretically yields steadier natriuresis; meta-analytic and observational data suggest fewer heart failure hospitalizations and improved functional status with torsemide versus furosemide, though the large pragmatic TRANSFORM-HF trial did not show a mortality or hospitalization benefit, underscoring that real-world heterogeneity and trial design matter for outcomes [^114BSwFq] [^1127wKg2] [^115Wg2z2].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought bumetanide's oral bioavailability was about 80–90%, but I should double-check that before asserting it. I cannot find a contemporary, high-quality source in the provided materials to confirm that exact range for bumetanide, so I will avoid over-specifying its bioavailability here; clinically, bumetanide is often perceived as more potent and sometimes better absorbed than furosemide, but without a direct citation in this packet I will keep the emphasis on torsemide and the SC route for evidence-based PK advantages.

> Next, I should review how these PK differences translate into practice. Because oral furosemide absorption is variable and often reduced in congestion, clinicians escalate frequency (e.g. BID), switch to IV in the hospital, or consider SC furosemide as a bridge to achieve predictable diuresis. Guidelines endorse IV loop diuretics for decompensation and note that some patients respond better to torsemide due to absorption and duration, while emerging pathways support SC furosemide to reduce readmissions and enable home decongestion when oral therapy fails [^116s4jCZ] [^111pjgDm] [^111xFVck].

> I should confirm dosing and monitoring implications to keep this clinically actionable. Typical oral furosemide starts at 20–40 mg once daily, titrated to effect, with BID dosing commonly needed; in severe edema, total daily doses can exceed 80–120 mg, but higher chronic dosing warrants close lab monitoring for electrolytes and renal function; SC furosemide is delivered as 30 mg in the first hour followed by 12.5 mg/h for 4 hours (total 80 mg), producing diuresis comparable to IV and allowing outpatient decongestion in selected patients [^114Ekz9C] [^115wzdcU] [^112uUFqB].

> But wait, what if absorption is compromised by factors beyond edema? I need to ensure I consider protein binding and transporter-mediated delivery. Furosemide is highly albumin-bound and requires active tubular secretion via OAT1/3 to reach its luminal site of action; hypoalbuminemia and reduced renal blood flow can blunt delivery, and in some settings co-administration of albumin has been explored to enhance natriuresis, though this strategy is nuanced and not universally applicable; additionally, drug–drug interactions via transporters can modestly alter exposure, reinforcing the need to individualize and monitor response rather than assume dose equivalence across patients [^113pfaM2] [^1128hQ4n] [^112AhVUK].

> Let me reconsider the overall message to ensure internal consistency with the evidence. Furosemide oral bioavailability averages roughly 60–64% in healthy, fasted individuals but exhibits wide interindividual variability and is frequently lower and unpredictable in heart failure due to gut congestion; SC furosemide achieves near-IV bioavailability and reliable diuresis, offering a practical outpatient bridge when oral therapy is unreliable; torsemide provides more predictable oral exposure and longer action, with mixed clinical outcome data, so agent selection should be tailored to severity of congestion, prior response, access to parenteral options, and the need for sustained natriuresis, with vigilant monitoring of volume status and electrolytes guiding titration [^113pfaM2] [^115wzdcU] [^114BSwFq] [^115Wg2z2].

---

Furosemide has **oral bioavailability of 60–70%** [^113pfaM2] in healthy individuals, with peak plasma levels at 1–2 hours and a half-life of 1–3 hours. In heart failure or edematous states, **bioavailability drops to ~40%** [^116BRcXA] due to gut edema and delayed absorption, increasing variability and risk of subtherapeutic effects. Intravenous furosemide has 100% bioavailability with rapid onset, while subcutaneous formulations achieve ~99% bioavailability [^115wzdcU] and provide sustained diuresis, offering a reliable outpatient alternative when oral absorption is impaired [^116eNWBq].

---

## Oral bioavailability

- **Healthy individuals**: Oral bioavailability is 60–70% [^113pfaM2], with peak plasma levels at 1–2 hours and a half-life of 1–3 hours.

- **Heart failure/edematous states**: Bioavailability falls to ~40% [^111XZ7XP] due to gut edema and delayed absorption, increasing variability and subtherapeutic risk.

- **Oral solution vs tablets**: The solution is absorbed faster (Tmax ~50 min) than tablets (~87 min) [^113pfaM2], but overall exposure (AUC) is similar.

---

## Intravenous bioavailability

Intravenous administration provides **100% bioavailability** [^notfound] with rapid onset (within minutes) and predictable diuresis, making it the preferred route in acute settings or when oral absorption is unreliable [^111pjgDm].

---

## Subcutaneous bioavailability

Subcutaneous furosemide (e.g. Furoscix) achieves **~99% bioavailability** [^115wzdcU] relative to IV, with sustained plasma levels and diuresis over 8–12 hours. This profile supports outpatient use when oral absorption is impaired or IV access is limited [^115JHe11].

---

## Factors influencing bioavailability

Several factors influence **furosemide bioavailability**:

| **Factor** | **Effect on bioavailability** |
|-|-|
| Heart failure/edema | Decreased due to gut edema and delayed absorption [^115JHe11] |
| Renal impairment | Reduced clearance increases exposure but does not significantly alter absorption [^notfound] |
| Age | Elderly may have reduced absorption and clearance [^notfound] |
| Formulation | Oral solution absorbed faster than tablets, but AUC similar [^113pfaM2] |

---

## Clinical implications

- **Oral therapy**: Useful in stable patients; monitor for reduced efficacy in heart failure/edema [^111pjgDm].

- **IV therapy**: Preferred in acute settings or when rapid, predictable diuresis is needed [^1151W5Ef].

- **SC therapy**: Offers near-IV bioavailability for outpatient use when oral absorption is impaired [^116ccGNa].

---

Furosemide's oral bioavailability is **moderate and variable**, reduced further in heart failure/edema; IV provides 100% bioavailability, and SC formulations achieve ~99% with sustained effect, enabling reliable outpatient diuresis when oral therapy is inadequate [^115JHe11].

### Nabumetone (Relafen ds) [^112iE6Wy]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Drug Interactions

ACE-Inhibitors

Reports suggest that NSAIDs may diminish the antihypertensive effect of ACE-inhibitors. This interaction should be given consideration in patients taking NSAIDs concomitantly with ACE-inhibitors.

Aspirin

When nabumetone tablets are administered with aspirin, its protein binding is reduced, although the clearance of free nabumetone is not altered. The clinical significance of this interaction is not known; however, as with other NSAIDs, concomitant administration of nabumetone tablets and aspirin is not generally recommended because of the potential of increased adverse effects.

Diuretics

Clinical studies, as well as postmarketing observations, have shown that nabumetone tablets can reduce the natriuretic effect of furosemide and thiazides in some patients. This response has been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis. During concomitant therapy with NSAIDs, the patient should be observed closely for signs of renal failure [see WARNINGS], as well as to assure diuretic efficacy.

Lithium

NSAIDs have produced an elevation of plasma lithium levels and a reduction in renal lithium clearance. The mean minimum lithium concentration increased 15% and the renal clearance was decreased by approximately 20%. These effects have been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis by the NSAID. Thus, when NSAIDs and lithium are administered concurrently, subjects should be observed carefully for signs of lithium toxicity.

Methotrexate

NSAIDs have been reported to competitively inhibit methotrexate accumulation in rabbit kidney slices. This may indicate that they could enhance the toxicity of methotrexate. Caution should be used when NSAIDs are administered concomitantly with methotrexate.

Warfarin

The effects of warfarin and NSAIDs on GI bleeding are synergistic, such that users of both drugs together have a risk of serious GI bleeding higher than users of either drug alone.

In vitro studies have shown that, because of its affinity for protein, 6MNA may displace other protein-bound drugs from their binding site. Caution should be exercised when administering nabumetone tablets with warfarin since interactions have been seen with other NSAIDs.

Concomitant administration of an aluminum-containing antacid had no significant effect on the bioavailability of 6MNA. When administered with food or milk, there is more rapid absorption; however, the total amount of 6MNA in the plasma is unchanged [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].

Results

In both the First-in-Man and PK/PD Pivotal studies, the SC administration of furosemide was well tolerated with no evidence of any drug-induced skin reactions. In the First-in-Man study, all 10 subjects completed each of the cross-over treatments. The mean age of the subjects was 69.9 ± 8.6 years, 80% were male, the body mass index was 27.5 ± 4.5 kg/m 2, and all were New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class II (Table 1).

Table 1
Subject Demographics and Clinical Characteristics From the First-in-Man and PK/PD Pivotal Studies

Following SC administration, all subjects (n = 10) achieved typically therapeutic plasma furosemide levels within 30 min of the start of administration (mean 916 ± 302 ng/ml, range 617 to 1,548 ng/ml), with levels of around 2,000 ng/ml (mean 2,129 ± 445 ng/ml, range 1,615 to 3,085 ng/ml) at 60 min (Figure 1). The plasma furosemide levels in the plateau phase (60 to 300 min) were maintained in a narrow range from the C max (67% to 93%). Following oral administration, marked intersubject variation was observed, with a 70-fold difference between the highest and lowest furosemide levels at 30 min (mean 1,745 ± 1,227 ng/ml, range 43 to 2,989 ng/ml) and a 10-fold difference at 60 min (mean 2,620 ± 1,346 ng/ml, range 447 to 4,406 ng/ml). Most subjects experienced a peak level at 60 min, and only 10% maintained plasma levels in the plateau phase of a minimum of 1,000 ng/ml compared with 100% following SC administration (Figure 1). Mean bioavailability (oral to SC) was 61% (range 33% to 96%). Fluid intake during the study was ad libitum (range 1,175 to 2,000 mL over the 8-h time interval). Total urine output was 1,550 mL (range 1,353 to 1,866 ml) after oral administration, and 1,833 mL (range 1,623 to 2,726 ml) after SC delivery.

### Diuretic efficiency of a single dose of subcutaneous versus oral furosemide after heart failure hospitalization across diuretic resistance strata: a pilot randomized controlled trial [^111XZ7XP]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

The greater efficacy of sc furosemide (vs. oral) in DR patients may be related to its pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. The biphasic administration of sc furosemide (30 mg over 60 min, then 12.5 mg/h for 4 h) provides more consistent drug levels that is comparable to IV bolus and is higher than what is achieved by oral dose of furosemide. Furthermore, in contrast with the variable absorption of oral furosemide (~50%), which is particularly compromised in HF patients owing to altered gastrointestinal function and oedema, sc furosemide achieves nearly 100% bioavailability. The sc route ensures more reliable drug delivery and a prolonged absorption phase, potentially leading to more sustained diuretic effects in patients with DR.

Several limitations to our study are noteworthy. First, our pilot RCT had a small sample size and tested efficacy of a single dose of diuretic therapy. Second, the single‐centre, open‐label design limits the generalizability of our findings. Third, there was some imbalance in SGLT2i use across treatment arms. However, sensitivity analyses adjusting for the same yielded comparable findings to the primary analysis. Finally, the home diuretic dosing was based on the discretion of the treating physician at discharge without an objective assessment of its adequacy. However, the primary outcome of diuretic efficiency was normalized to the dose of furosemide, limiting the potential for bias from differences in the home diuretic dose. Future larger trials are needed to evaluate the clinical efficacy of sc furosemide as an alternative or add‐on diuretic strategy to oral furosemide for patients with DR and recent ADHF hospitalization.

Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Diuretics in heart failure — patient selection and dosing advises that diuretics should be prescribed to all patients who have evidence of, and to most patients with a prior history of, fluid retention and should generally be combined with an ACEI and a beta-blocker, as few patients with HF will be able to maintain dry weight without diuretics; for initiation and maintenance, the most commonly used loop diuretic is furosemide, though some respond to torsemide due to superior absorption and longer duration of action; outpatient therapy is commonly started with low doses and increased until urine output rises and weight decreases, generally by 0.5 to 1.0 kg daily, with further dose or frequency escalations (i.e., twice-daily dosing) possibly required; the ultimate goal is elimination of clinical evidence of fluid retention, and diuretics are generally combined with moderate dietary sodium restriction (3 to 4 g daily).

### Pharmacokinetic evaluation of a drug transporter cocktail consisting of digoxin, furosemide, metformin, and rosuvastatin [^112VXXqn]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2016). Low credibility.

This article reports the clinical investigation of a probe drug cocktail containing substrates of key drug transporters. Single oral doses of 0.25 mg digoxin (P-gp), 5 mg furosemide (OAT1 and OAT3), 500 mg metformin (OCT2, MATE1, and MATE2-K), and 10 mg rosuvastatin (OATP1B1, OATP1B3, and BCRP) were administered separately or as a cocktail in a randomized six-period crossover trial in 24 healthy male volunteers. As a cocktail, relative bioavailabilities of digoxin and metformin and furosemide AUC0-tz were similar to separate dosing. However, when administered as a cocktail the Cmax of furosemide was 19.1% lower and the Cmax and AUC0-tz of rosuvastatin were 38.6% and 43.4% higher, respectively. In addition, the effects of increased doses of metformin or furosemide on the cocktail were investigated in 11 and 12 subjects, respectively. The cocktail explored in this trial has the potential to be used for the in vivo screening of transporter-mediated drug-drug interactions. © 2016 American Society for Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics.

### Furosemide [^114Ekz9C]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Edema

Therapy should be individualized according to patient response to gain maximal therapeutic response and to determine the minimal dose needed to maintain that response.

Adults — The usual initial dose of furosemide is 20 mg to 80 mg given as a single dose. Ordinarily a prompt diuresis ensues. If needed, the same dose can be administered 6 to 8 hours later or the dose may be increased. The dose may be raised by 20 mg or 40 mg and given not sooner than 6 to 8 hours after the previous dose until the desired diuretic effect has been obtained. The individually determined single dose should then be given once or twice daily (e.g., at 8 am and 2 pm). The dose of furosemide may be carefully titrated up to 600 mg/day in patients with clinically severe edematous states.

Edema may be most efficiently and safely mobilized by giving furosemide on 2 to 4 consecutive days each week.

When doses exceeding 80 mg/day are given for prolonged periods, careful clinical observation and laboratory monitoring are particularly advisable (see PRECAUTIONS: Laboratory Test).

Geriatric patients — In general, dose selection for the elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range (see PRECAUTIONS: Geriatric Use).

### Benefits and risks of furosemide in acute kidney injury [^1159zCND]. Anaesthesia (2010). Low credibility.

Furosemide, a potent loop diuretic, is frequently used in different stages of acute kidney injury, but its clinical roles remain uncertain. This review summarises the pharmacology of furosemide, its potential uses and side effects, and the evidence of its efficacy. Furosemide is actively secreted by the proximal tubules into the urine before reaching its site of action at the ascending limb of loop of Henle. It is the urinary concentrations of furosemide that determine its diuretic effect. The severity of acute kidney injury has a significant effect on the diuretic response to furosemide; a good 'urinary response' may be considered as a 'proxy' for having some residual renal function. The current evidence does not suggest that furosemide can reduce mortality in patients with acute kidney injury. In patients with acute lung injury without haemodynamic instability, furosemide may be useful in achieving fluid balance to facilitate mechanical ventilation according to the lung-protective ventilation strategy.

### Aliskiren hemifumarate and hydrochlorothiazide (Tekturna HCT) [^117RdV8N]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

Hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ)

About 70% of an orally administered dose of HCTZ is eliminated in the urine as unchanged drug.

Drug Interactions:

Aliskiren

The effect of coadministered drugs on the pharmacokinetics of aliskiren and vice versa, were studied in several single and multiple dose studies. Pharmacokinetic measures indicating the magnitude of these interactions are presented in Figure 5 (impact of coadministered drugs on aliskiren) and Figure 6 (impact on coadministered drugs).

Figure 5: The Impact of Coadministered Drugs on the Pharmacokinetics of Aliskiren

*Ketoconazole: A 400 mg once daily dose was not studied, but would be expected to increase aliskiren blood levels further.

**Ramipril, valsartan, irbesartan: In general, avoid combined use of aliskiren with ACE inhibitors or ARBs, particularly in patients with CrCl less than 60 mL/min [see Drug Interactions (7)].

Warfarin: There was no clinically significant effect of a single dose of warfarin 25 mg on the pharmacokinetics of aliskiren.

Figure 6: The Impact of Aliskiren on the Pharmacokinetics of Coadministered Drugs

* Furosemide: Patients receiving furosemide may find its effects diminished after starting aliskiren. In patients with heart failure, co-administration of aliskiren (300 mg/day) reduced plasma AUC and Cmaxof oral furosemide (60 mg/day) by 17% and 27%, respectively, and reduced 24 hour urinary furosemide excretion by 29%. This change in exposure did not result in statistically significant difference in total urine volume and urinary sodium excretion over 24 hours. However, a transient decrease in urinary sodium excretion and urine volume effects up to 12 hours were observed when furosemide was co-administered with aliskiren 300 mg/day.

**Ramipril, valsartan: In general, avoid combined use of aliskiren with ACE inhibitors or ARBs, particularly in patients with CrCl less than 60 mL/min [see Drug Interactions (7)].

Drugs that alter gastrointestinal motility: The bioavailability of thiazide-type diuretics may be increased by anticholinergic agents (e.g., atropine, biperiden), apparently due to a decrease in gastrointestinal motility and the stomach emptying rate. Conversely, pro-kinetic drugs may decrease the bioavailability of thiazide diuretics.

Pharmacodynamics

In the PK/PD Pivotal study, fluid intake was controlled and restricted to 100 mL of water every hour starting 2 h before dosing. Administration of IV and SC furosemide resulted in similar degrees of diuresis at both the 0- to 8-h interval (2,718 ± 654 mL and 2,663 ± 1,021 mL for the IV and SC routes, respectively) and the 0- to 24-h interval (3,672 ± 740 mL and 3,614 ± 1,045 mL for the IV and SC routes, respectively) (Figure 3). Mean diuresis (0 to 8 h) was comparable for both treatment periods (2,578 ± 854 mL vs. 2,803 ± 846 ml) without an indication of possible sequence or period effect. Urine sodium excretion at 0 to 8 h was 307 mmol and 286 mmol for the IV and SC routes, respectively, and at 0 to 24 h, 367 mmol and 341 mmol for the IV and SC routes, respectively (Figure 4).

Information For Patients

Patients receiving Furosemide tablets should be advised that they may experience symptoms from excessive fluid and/or electrolyte losses. The postural hypotension that sometimes occurs can usually be managed by getting up slowly. Potassium supplements and/or dietary measures may be needed to control or avoid hypokalemia.

Patients with diabetes mellitus should be told that furosemide may increase blood glucose levels and thereby affect urine glucose tests. The skin of some patients may be more sensitive to the effects of sunlight while taking furosemide.

Hypertensive patients should avoid medications that may increase blood pressure, including over-the-counter products for appetite suppression and cold symptoms.

### Innovation in diuretic therapy: the missing ingredient for treating worsening heart Failure Outside the hospital? [^116eNWBq]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2018). Low credibility.

In this context, development of subcutaneous (SC) furosemide has garnered increasing optimism as a safe and effective outpatient alternative to the traditional hospital-based IV diuretic strategy. In this issue of JACC: Basic to Translational Science, Sica et al.present primary data from 2 small experiences testing biphasic delivery of a novel buffered SC furosemide formulation among patients with chronic HF. The first study randomized 10 patients in a first-in-human, proof-of-concept, crossover study designed to characterize the pharmacokinetic profile of the SC formulation. Following SC initiation, therapeutic plasma levels were reached within 30 min and were maintained in a narrow therapeutic range for the duration of administration. In contrast (and as consistent with prior data), plasma levels following oral furosemide dosing were highly variable, with intersubject variation between highest and lowest levels 70-fold different at 30 min and 10-fold different at 60 min, respectively. Compared with SC, oral furosemide resulted in a shorter duration at therapeutic plasma levels and less urine output. The second crossover study randomized 16 patients and aimed to define the bioavailability of SC furosemide versus IV. As compared with IV, peak plasma concentrations of SC were lower (geometric mean 1,990 ng/ml vs. 8,270 ng/ml), and time to peak was longer (median 4 h vs. 125 min), but therapeutic plasma levels were maintained longer with SC such that areas under plasma concentration curves were nearly identical, and absolute bioavailability was complete (> 99%). Pharmacodynamic properties of SC and IV also appeared nearly identical, with very similar degrees of diuresis and natriuresis with either formulation. Safety and tolerability data across the 2 studies were reassuring, with minimal evidence of erythema and swelling at the site of SC injection.

### Nabumetone [^117FHLan]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Drug Interactions

ACE-inhibitors: Reports suggest that NSAIDs may diminish the antihypertensive effect of ACE-inhibitors. This interaction should be given consideration in patients taking NSAIDs concomitantly with ACE-inhibitors.

Aspirin: When nabumetone tablets are administered with aspirin, its protein binding is reduced, although the clearance of free nabumetone is not altered. The clinical significance of this interaction is not known; however, as with other NSAIDs, concomitant administration of nabumetone tablets and aspirin is not generally recommended because of the potential of increased adverse effects.

Diuretics: Clinical studies, as well as post marketing observations, have shown that nabumetone can reduce the natriuretic effect of furosemide and thiazides in some patients. This response has been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis. During concomitant therapy with NSAIDs, the patient should be observed closely for signs of renal failure (see WARNINGS, Renal Effects), as well as to assure diuretic efficacy.

Lithium: NSAIDs have produced an elevation of plasma lithium levels and a reduction in renal lithium clearance. The mean minimum lithium concentration increased 15% and the renal clearance was decreased by approximately 20%. These effects have been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis by the NSAID. Thus, when NSAIDs and lithium are administered concurrently, subjects should be observed carefully for signs of lithium toxicity.

Methotrexate: NSAIDs have been reported to competitively inhibit methotrexate accumulation in rabbit kidney slices. This may indicate that they could enhance the toxicity of methotrexate. Caution should be used when NSAIDs are administered concomitantly with methotrexate.

Warfarin: The effects of warfarin and NSAIDs on GI bleeding are synergistic, such that users of both drugs together have a risk of serious GI bleeding higher than users of either drug alone.

In vitro studies have shown that, because of its affinity for protein, 6MNA may displace other protein-bound drugs from their binding site. Caution should be exercised when administering nabumetone with warfarin since interactions have been seen with other NSAIDs.

Concomitant administration of an aluminum-containing antacid had no significant effect on the bioavailability of 6MNA. When administered with food or milk, there is more rapid absorption; however, the total amount of 6MNA in the plasma is unchanged (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacokinetics).

### Pharmacokinetic evaluation of a drug transporter cocktail consisting of digoxin, furosemide, metformin, and rosuvastatin [^1172WzEh]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2016). Low credibility.

Digoxin

Geometric mean plasma concentration–time profiles of digoxin when given alone (reference) or as a component of test cocktails T1, T2, and T3 are shown in Figure 1 and Supporting Figure S1 and the pharmacokinetic parameters in Table 1. Maximum plasma concentrations occurred at a median t max of 1.0 hours after all treatments, and urinary excretion parameters fe 0‐36 and CL R,0‐36 were comparable between the different treatments (Table S1). Graphical comparisons of individual and geometric mean AUC 0‐tz and C max values are given in Figure S2.

Table 1
Geometric means and relative bioavailability for the primary pharmacokinetic endpoints of digoxin given as a single administered drug (reference) or in test cocktails 1, 2, and 3

Figure 1
Geometric mean plasma concentration–time profiles of digoxin (a), furosemide (b), metformin (c), and rosuvastatin (d). The four compounds were either given alone as monotreatment or all together as test cocktail T1 at doses of 0.25 mg digoxin, 5 mg furosemide, 500 mg metformin hydrochloride, or 10 mg rosuvastatin. In test cocktail T2, a doubled metformin dose was given (1,000 mg), and in test cocktail T3, a 4‐fold furosemide dose was given (20 mg) together with the other compounds. Scaling is linear.

The relative bioavailability of digoxin in test cocktail T1 compared to dosing alone was close to 100% for AUC 0‐tz and C max (Table 1), and the 90% confidence intervals (CIs) were within the standard bioequivalence (BE) acceptance range of 80 to 125%. Relative bioavailability of digoxin in cocktail T2 compared to digoxin alone was also close to 100% for both AUC 0‐tz and C max. The 90% CI for AUC 0‐tz were within the standard BE range, but the upper 90% CI for C max was slightly above the upper BE limit. Bioavailability of digoxin as part of cocktail T3 compared to dosing alone was decreased by 17.0% with respect to AUC 0‐tz and 11.4% with respect to C max (Table 1). Bioavailability of digoxin as part of cocktail T3 compared to dosing as part of T1 was decreased by 22.6% with respect to AUC 0‐tz and 12.2% with respect to C max. The secondary endpoint AUC 0‐∞ was not used for relative bioavailability analysis because it could not be determined with sufficient precision.

Plasma Furosemide Levels Following IV and SC Administration (PK/PD Pivotal Study)

All subjects achieved therapeutic plasma furosemide levels of over 1,000 ng/ml within 1 h after subcutaneous (SC) administration, which were maintained for at least 6 h. The figure is in semi-log scale. IV = intravenous; PK/PD = Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic.

Table 2
Plasma Furosemide Noncompartmental PK Parameters Following IV Administration

Following SC administration, therapeutic furosemide concentrations were observed as early as 30 min (600 ± 209 ng/ml) and 1 h (1,470 ± 321 ng/ml) after the initiation of the infusion, and increased steadily to 1,910 ± 570 ng/ml by 5 h (immediately before removal of the SC infusion), for a median t max of approximately 4 h (range 1 to 5.05 h) and a geometric mean C max of 1,990 ng/ml. The geometric mean AUC last and AUC ∞ estimates were 12,400 and 12,500 h ∙ ng/ml, respectively, the geometric mean of the t ½ estimates was 3.04 h, and therapeutic levels of furosemide of 1,000 ng/ml were maintained up to 6 h. Most subjects (75%) receiving SC furosemide had a quantifiable concentration of furosemide up to 24 h post-dose. The summary statistics of noncompartmental pharmacokinetic parameters for the SC furosemide are presented in Table 3.

Plasma Furosemide Noncompartmental PK Parameters Following Subcutaneous Administration

The geometric LSM of AUC last and AUC ∞ for subjects receiving SC furosemide was similar to the reference IV furosemide, with ratios of 99.50% and 99.65%, respectively. The absolute bioavailability of furosemide was 99.65% with 90% CIs of 94.79% to 104.75% for the AUC ∞, and 99.50% with 90% CIs of 94.77% to 104.46% for the AUC last.

### Subcutaneous furosemide in heart failure: pharmacokinetic characteristics of a newly buffered solution [^115raNvP]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2018). Low credibility.

With similar diuresis as conventional IV furosemide, our results demonstrate the feasibility and safety of administering a novel buffered furosemide formulation via the SC route using the biphasic delivery profile. Because placing and starting IV drug administrations may only be performed by a certified health care professional, the SC route with an easy-to-use patch pump may allow for use by patients or lay caregivers as directed by a health care professional. As with all medical devices, qualifying the patient or caregiver and operator training by a health care professional will be a requirement for safe and effective use. Clinicians and institutions have adopted a range of strategies in the treatment of fluid overload in HF. These typically depend upon the available resources and the organization of practice or clinic. Furosemide is among the best-known and most widely used medications, and this familiarity will probably lead clinicians and practices to experiment with workflows specific to their setup that take advantage of this new option. Experimentation by individual clinicians and structured research are likely to focus on testing specific workflows with an aim to reduce the burden for the health care system and patient. These novel workflows may rise to the level of a paradigm change such as at-home treatment with the help of home health services as an alternative to inpatient care, a marked shortening of length of stay with at-home treatment to achieve euvolemia, a closed-loop kind of model with a reliable method to monitor fluid overload. These new care strategies would require adequately designed controlled studies to gain support and provide compelling information to support changes in reimbursement that now often support the in-patient care model.

Study limitations

First, it was designed and conducted as an experimental PK/PD study, resulting in a highly artificial setup not representative of the clinical setting in which furosemide might be used. Also, the study was conducted in patients with stable HF who discontinued oral medication on the day before the investigation to induce slight hypervolemia, not patients with clinical hypervolemia in need of parenteral diuretics. Additionally, the study was only powered for its pharmacokinetic endpoint, resulting in a small sample size. A prospective, randomized trial (Sub-Q Versus IV Furosemide in Acute Heart Failure;) is currently underway to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of this route of administration in patients with decompensated HF.

### Sodium and fluid excretion with torsemide in healthy subjects is limited by the short duration of diuretic action [^117JVhN4]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

The short duration of action of 2 to 4 hours of all loop diuretics after oral dosing is a class defect that can lead to 3 problems. First, the urinary concentration of the loop diuretic resides within the therapeutic range for only a short period. 10, 15 Second, the abrupt but short‐lived natriuresis leaves ≈20 hours for the kidney to regain the salt and water lost before the next daily dose. 8, 12, 16, 17, 18, 19 These attributes account for the failure of furosemide and bumetanide to cause net Na + loss over 1 to 3 days of once‐daily administration to normal subjects unless dietary salt is restricted to below 120 mmol·d −1. 8, 16, 18 Third, the torrential acute diuresis ("Niagara effect") can cause incontinence in subjects with impaired bladder control. 20

We studied a novel extended‐release (ER) formulation of torsemide that delivers the drug into solution over 8 to 10 hours (Figure 1) to test the hypothesis that the inability of a single dose of a loop diuretic to deplete the body of salt and water during high salt intake is caused by a limited duration of action on the kidney. We compared the effects of 20 mg of oral torsemide as an immediate‐release (IR) or ER formulation given to 10 healthy volunteers consuming a fixed high‐salt diet containing 300 mmol Na + daily. We measured pharmacokinetics, creatinine clearance (C CR), and patterns of electrolyte and water excretion after drug administration to assess the mechanisms of any differences.

### Inhaled furosemide for relief of air hunger versus sense of breathing effort: a randomized controlled trial [^114aBZZ3]. Respiratory Research (2018). Low credibility.

No evidence for systemic action for dyspnoea relief with inhaled furosemide

A potential alternative mechanism of action of furosemide in relief of dyspnoea is via systemic effects from absorption of the inhaled furosemide into the circulation. Morélot-Panzini et al. (2018) estimated an absorption efficiency of up to 30% of the inhaled dose. From this information and assuming the maximal level of efficiency, we estimated that a 40 mg inhaled dose would result in 5 mg entering the systemic circulation assuming a respiratory frequency of 12 breaths per minute and a duty cycle of 0.4. This appears to be higher than our estimate of systemic load of 1.5 mg from inhalation of a nebulized dose of 40 mg in this study. They also found that when given 15 mg intravenously participants had an average 16%VAS improvement in dyspnoea. It is suggested that in heart failure systemic furosemide relieves dyspnoea by easing pulmonary congestion and thereby reducing activation of pulmonary C-fibre receptors. This cannot explain relief of dyspnoea by intravenous furosemide in healthy volunteers with no pulmonary congestion. The authors suggest that this result could be explained by the placebo effect as the participants were informed that they would only receive active substances. In the current study a dose of intravenous furosemide (1.5 mg) that more closely matched the amount absorbed from the inhaled dose was infused concurrently with inhaled saline. To maintain blinding intravenous saline was infused during furosemide inhalation. In both cases the rate of infusion was set to match the period of inhalation. We therefore consider the findings of the current study showing no significant relief from intravenous furosemide (mean ± SEM, − 2.5% ± 4) to demonstrate more clearly that the AH relief by inhaled furosemide is via direct actions within the lungs.

Further support for a mechanism of relief of AH via direct actions in the lungs is provided by: i) direct exposure of the lung tissue to furosemide in rat preparations resulted in modulation of PSR afferent activity but not when administered intravenously ii) other studies in which beneficial effects of furosemide have been evident only when inhaled rather than administered via tablet iii) absence of haemodynamic changes with inhaled furosemide in a study assessing wedge pressure measurements in heart failure patients suggesting no systemic mechanism of action iv) absence of any detectable difference in cumulative urine output between the two groups in this study (SFS and FSF) which discounts a mechanism of action related to diuresis.

### Effect of the combination of bumetanide plus chlorthalidone on hypertension and volume overload in patients with chronic kidney disease stage 4–5 KDIGO without renal replacement therapy: a double-blind randomized HEBE-CKD trial [^114zrMqX]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

Our findings could have a positive clinical impact in management of volume overload in the chronic kidney disease population, whose prognosis has already been proven to improve with a reduction in volume overload. Szu-Chun Hung et al. employed a model to predict mortality based on patients' extracellular water to total body water ratio. This ratio expresses the amount of extracellular water that exists compared to total body water. In healthy people, the index is between 0.36 and 0.39, however, it has been observed that it is increased in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease and has been associated with multiple adverse outcomes. Patients were classified into two groups based on the extracellular water to total body water ratio with a cutoff of ± 48%, and after four years of follow-up, they observed twice the mortality rate in those with levels ≥ 48%. These results could be of particular interest when applied to this trial since, before the intervention, both groups had an ECW/TBW ratio > 50%; however, at the end of follow-up, only the combined treatment group exhibited a reduction to 46%, which could be impactful as a possible benefit in terms of mortality in this population.

Another finding was that treatment with loop diuretics alone was insufficient for blood pressure and volume overload control compared with bumetanide plus chlorthalidone. This was evidenced by the fact that in our trial, all patients had a history of chronic loop diuretic use (most were on furosemide); however, when they were randomized, furosemide was changed to bumetanide, a more potent loop diuretic with a dose equivalent to 160 mg furosemide QD. This protocol, along with our findings, allowed us to demonstrate that high doses of loop diuretics are not sufficient by themselves to achieve adequate blood pressure and volume overload in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease without renal replacement therapy. When employing high doses of bumetanide, the possibilities of poor efficacy of the loop diuretic secondary to pharmacokinetic processes associated with diuretic resistance, such as insufficient dosage, reduced absorption, low bioavailability, and interaction with uremic toxins, are diminished. We consider that this difference could be explained by chronic loop diuretic use and previously described adaptive changes at the distal convoluted tubule, in which patients exhibit higher sodium reabsorption, lower natriuresis, and, as a consequence, loss of loop diuretic efficacy.

13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY

13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility

Carcinogenesis

Furosemide was tested for carcinogenicity by oral administration in one strain of mice and one strain of rats. A small but significantly increased incidence of mammary gland carcinomas occurred in female mice at a dose approximately 8 times a human i.v. dose of 80 mg based on BSA and oral bioavailability corrections. There were marginal increases in uncommon tumors in male rats at a dose of 15 mg per kg (slightly greater than the maximum human dose) but not at 30 mg per kg.

Mutagenesis

Furosemide was devoid of mutagenic activity in various strains of Salmonella typhimurium when tested in the presence or absence of an in vitro metabolic activation system, and questionably positive for gene mutation in mouse lymphoma cells in the presence of rat liver S9 at the highest dose tested. Furosemide did not induce sister chromatid exchange in human cells in vitro, but other studies on chromosomal aberrations in human cells in vitro gave conflicting results. In Chinese hamster cells it induced chromosomal damage but was questionably positive for sister chromatid exchange. Studies on the induction by furosemide of chromosomal aberrations in mice were inconclusive. The urine of rats treated with this drug did not induce gene conversion in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

Impairment of Fertility

Furosemide produced no impairment of fertility in male or female rats, at 100 mg per kg per day (the maximum effective diuretic dose in the rat), approximately 7 times a human i.v. dose of 80 mg based on BSA and oral bioavailability corrections.

Table 13 — FDA-approved drugs for treatment of hypertension — Loop diuretics (alternative agents) include bumetanide 0.5–2 mg/d (daily frequency 2), furosemide 20–80 mg/d (daily frequency 2), and torsemide 5–10 mg/d (daily frequency 1). These are preferred diuretics in patients with symptomatic HF. They are preferred over thiazide-type diuretics in patients with moderate-to-severe CKD (eg, GFR < 30 mL/min). The longer-acting choice of torsemide is preferred for treatment of hypertension. A loop diuretic is an option for patients who develop thiazide-type diuretic associated hyponatremia.

### 10 issues for the clinician in tricuspid regurgitation evaluation and management: 2025 ACC expert consensus decision pathway: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^111xFVck]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Tricuspid regurgitation (TR) diuretic therapy — There are no specific disease-modifying medical therapies (or guideline Class I medical recommendations) for the treatment of TR, although the magnitude of TR can be reduced in many patients with management of left-sided heart disease and atrial fibrillation (AF), and because TR was the strongest multivariable predictor of persistent congestion in acute heart failure (HF), management of congestion should be a primary treatment goal. Loop diuretic effectiveness may be limited by impaired kidney function and, in chronic kidney disease, by reduced activity of the organic anion transporter and decreased renal blood flow that lower intratubular diuretic concentrations; severe TR can cause renal venous hypertension with lower glomerular filtration rate and diuretic resistance, and neurohormonal activation with lower cardiac output and higher central venous pressure increases active sodium and water reabsorption, perpetuating congestion and reducing responsiveness. For gut congestion with impaired absorption, an oral loop diuretic with higher bioavailability (torsemide, bumetanide) may be considered, although the TRANSFORM study did not demonstrate a benefit of torsemide over furosemide in chronic HF and was not stratified by TR. In patients refractory to high-dose oral diuretic therapy, changing to an intravenous loop diuretic with a bolus infusion can reduce PA pressures and increase venous capacitance; higher doses may sometimes be needed but may not be predictably effective in advanced chronic kidney disease. Add-on options include thiazide-like diuretics (oral metolazone or hydrochlorothiazide; intravenous chlorothiazide) for dual nephron blockade, and more recent data suggest a benefit of adding acetazolamide or a sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor to enhance decongestion; aggressive diuretic management may require the input of a pharmacist.

### Impact of baseline kidney dysfunction on oral diuretic efficacy following hospitalization for heart failure-insights from TRANSFORM-HF [^115Wg2z2]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2024). Medium credibility.

Aim

Among patients discharged after hospitalization for heart failure (HF), a strategy of torsemide versus furosemide showed no difference in all-cause mortality or hospitalization. Clinicians have traditionally favoured torsemide in the setting of kidney dysfunction due to better oral bioavailability and longer half-life, but direct supportive evidence is lacking.

Methods and Results

The TRANSFORM-HF trial randomized patients hospitalized for HF to a long-term strategy of torsemide versus furosemide, and enrolled patients across the spectrum of renal function (without dialysis). In this post-hoc analysis, baseline renal function during the index hospitalization was assessed as categories of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR; < 30, 30- < 60, ≥ 60ml/min/1.73m 2). The interaction between baseline renal function and treatment effect of torsemide versus furosemide was assessed with respect to mortality and hospitalization outcomes, and the change in Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire clinical summary score (KCCQ-CSS). Of 2859 patients randomized, 336 (11.8%) had eGFR < 30ml/min/1.73m 2, 1138 (39.8%) had eGFR 30- < 60ml/min/1.73m 2, and 1385 (48.4%) had eGFR ≥ 60ml/min/1.73m 2. Baseline eGFR did not modify treatment effects of torsemide versus furosemide on all adverse clinical outcomes including individual components or composites of all-cause mortality and all-cause (re)-hospitalizations, both when assessing eGFR categorically or continuously (p-value for interaction all > 0.108). Similarly, no treatment effect modification by eGFR was found for the change in KCCQ-CSS (p-value for interaction all > 0.052) when assessing eGFR categorically or continuously.

Conclusion

Among patients discharged after hospitalization for HF, there was no significant difference in clinical and patient-reported outcomes between torsemide and furosemide, irrespective of renal function.

### Comparative effect of loop diuretic prescription on mortality and heart failure readmission [^112c1CeQ]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Loop diuretics are a standard pharmacologic therapy in heart failure (HF) management. Although furosemide is most frequently used, torsemide and bumetanide are increasingly prescribed in clinical practice, possibly because of superior bioavailability. Few real-world comparative effectiveness studies have examined outcomes across all 3 loop diuretics. The study goal was to compare the effects of loop diuretic prescribing at HF hospitalization discharge on mortality and HF readmission. We identified patients in Medicare claims data initiating furosemide, torsemide, or bumetanide after an index HF hospitalization from 2007 to 2017. We estimated 6-month risks of all-cause mortality and a composite outcome (HF readmission or all-cause mortality) using inverse probability of treatment weighting to adjust for relevant confounders. We identified 62,632 furosemide, 1,720 torsemide, and 2,389 bumetanide initiators. The 6-month adjusted all-cause mortality risk was lowest for torsemide (13.2%), followed by furosemide (14.5%) and bumetanide (15.6%). The 6-month composite outcome risk was 21.4% for torsemide, 24.7% for furosemide, and 24.9% for bumetanide. Compared with furosemide, the 6-month all-cause mortality risk was 1.3% (95% confidence interval [CI]: -3.7, 1.0) lower for torsemide and 1.0% (95% CI: -1.2, 3.2) higher for bumetanide, and the 6-month composite outcome risk was 3.3% (95% CI: -6.3, -0.3) lower for torsemide and 0.2% (95% CI: -2.5, 2.9) higher for bumetanide. In conclusion, the findings suggested that the first prescribed loop diuretic following HF hospitalization is associated with clinically important differences in morbidity in older patients receiving torsemide, bumetanide, or furosemide. These differences were consistent for the effect of all-cause mortality alone, but were not statistically significant.

### Innovation in diuretic therapy: the missing ingredient for treating worsening heart Failure Outside the hospital? [^1151W5Ef]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2018). Low credibility.

Sica et al.are to be congratulated for providing critical data defining the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles of this novel SC agent. Nonetheless, some limitations of this work should be acknowledged. First, the characteristics of the study patients must be carefully considered when generalizing these results. Specifically, patients were clinically stable with mild symptoms, and recent HF hospitalization was an exclusion. Similarly, the combination of a low maintenance diuretic dosage, relatively preserved baseline renal function, and relatively robust baseline blood pressure suggests absence of significant diuretic resistance in these cohorts. Second, study patients tended to have relatively mild elevations in body mass index, and patients with significant obesity were excluded. The feasibility and efficacy of SC delivery must be confirmed in patients with both significant obesity and cardiac cachexia. Third, although safety data were favorable, future studies must clarify the safety and tolerability of repeated long-term SC administration. Fourth, future studies are needed to prove the feasibility of an infusion pump apparatus suitable for home use. Not only must a pump prove its durability over repeated injections, but it must also be sufficiently simple to allow patients successful operation in the home and reliable administration of medication. Fifth, although these preliminary data for diuresis and natriuresis with SC therapy are encouraging, larger studies are needed to validate effects on decongestion and explore implications on subsequent risks of hospitalization and other clinical events.

Although some patients with WHF experience rapid clinical deterioration (e.g. "flash" pulmonary edema), most have gradually worsening congestion over a prolonged period (i.e. days to weeks), thus offering a potential window of time when outpatient providers are tasked with modifying therapy in hopes of restoring baseline status. Unfortunately, even if this window is recognized, the lack of effective and reliable outpatient therapy directly contributes to an enormous number of HF hospitalizations. For instance, furosemide is the most commonly used loop diuretic agent, and oral doses are frequently escalated in the presence of worsening symptoms. The inconsistent bioavailability of oral furosemide highlighted in the current study reaffirms that up-titration may be a flawed (or futile) strategy for many patients when dependable diuretic effects are required and the need for hospitalization hangs in the balance. In contrast, although study of SC furosemide remains at an early stage, the possibility of delivering an "IV equivalent" diuretic agent in the home could be transformative.

### Meta-analysis comparing torsemide versus furosemide in patients with heart failure [^114BSwFq]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Although torsemide's oral bioavailability and half-life theoretically render it a more efficient diuretic than furosemide, the clinical outcomes of torsemide compared with furosemide remain unclear. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis, including all published studies that compared torsemide and furosemide use in heart failure patients from January 1996 through August 2019. Nineteen studies (9 randomized control trials [RCTs] and 10 observational studies) with a total of 19,280 patients were included. During a mean follow-up duration of 15 months, torsemide was associated with a numerically lower risk of hospitalization due to heart failure (10.6% vs 18.4%; odds ratio [OR] 0.72, 95% confidence interval [CI] [0.51, 1.03], p = 0.07, I² = 18%; number needed to treat [NNT] = 23) compared with furosemide. Torsemide was associated with statistically significant more improvement in functional status from New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III/IV to I/II (72.5% vs 58%; OR 2.32, 95% CI (1.32, 4.1), p = 0.004, I² = 27%; NNT = 5) and lower risk of cardiac mortality (1.5% vs 4.4%; OR 0.37, 95% CI (0.20, 0.66), p < 0.001, I² = 0%, NNT = 40) compared with furosemide. However, there was no difference in all-cause mortality or medication side effects between the 2 groups. In conclusion, compared with furosemide, torsemide use was associated with significant more improvement in functional status and lower cardiac mortality; and numerically fewer hospitalizations in patients with heart failure.

### Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of a novel formulation of furosemide administered as a single subcutaneous injection [^111UM5Zg]. Clinical Therapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Furoscix (furosemide injection) 80 mg/10 mL is a pH neutral formulation administered subcutaneously (SC) over 5 hours to treat edema in adults with chronic HF or chronic kidney disease. Furosemide 80 mg/mL is a novel concentrated formulation administered as a single 1.0-mL SC injection that could improve convenience for patients. This randomized, open-label, phase 1 study assessed the pharmacokinetics, bioavailability, pharmacodynamics, and safety of furosemide 80 mg/mL SC versus furosemide 80 mg administered intravenously (IV).

Methods

Healthy volunteers were randomized 1:1 to furosemide 80 mg/mL SC or furosemide 80 mg IV (two 40-mg boluses, 2 hours apart), and after a 3-day washout, received the opposite treatment. Plasma furosemide pharmacokinetics, urine output, and urinary sodium and potassium excretion were measured through 12 hours post-dose. Bioavailability (the primary endpoint) was assessed as the least-squares mean ratio (LSMR) of area under the curve (AUC) from time 0-last (AUC last) and 0-infinity (AUC inf) between furosemide SC and furosemide IV. Plasma furosemide pharmacokinetics were assessed noncompartmentally. Pharmacodynamics were assessed using a repeated measures, mixed model analysis. Safety was assessed through end of study.

Results

Twenty-one participants were randomized (furosemide SC/IV, n = 10; furosemide IV/SC, n = 11). The furosemide SC/IV LSMR (90% confidence interval [CI]) AUC last was 106.1% (102.7%, 109.6%), and LSMR (90% CI) AUC inf was 107.3% (103.9%, 110.8%). Furosemide 80 mg/mL SC had bioavailability equivalent to furosemide 80 mg IV, as the CIs fell within 80.0%-125.0%. Mean (SD) C max was 4532.9 (1497.7) ng/mL with furosemide 80 mg/mL SC and 10,087.6 (2804.7) ng/mL with furosemide IV. The therapeutic effects of furosemide 80 mg/mL SC on diuresis, natriuresis, and kaliuresis occurred within 1 hour of treatment and were consistent with those of furosemide IV at all time points. There was no significant difference between furosemide 80 mg/mL SC versus furosemide IV in total urine output or urinary sodium or potassium excretion at 0–6 hours, 0–8 hours, or 0–12 hours. Adverse events (AEs) occurred in 14 (66.7%) participants (furosemide SC, n = 11 [52.4%]; furosemide IV, n = 7 [35.0%]) and were mild or moderate. Ten (47.6%) participants had injection site AEs, all of which were treatment-related, mild, non-serious, and resolved. Injection site pain scores graded on a Likert 11-point scale remained low (mean, < 0.4; median, 0) at all time points, were similar between groups, and decreased over time.

Conclusions

Furosemide 80 mg/mL SC injection was generally well tolerated and had bioavailability, diuresis, natriuresis, and kaliuresis consistent with those of furosemide IV.

### Does long-term furosemide therapy cause thiamine deficiency in patients with heart failure? A focused review [^112vzC65]. The American Journal of Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Diuretic therapy is a cornerstone in the management of heart failure. Most studies assessing body thiamine status have reported variable degrees of thiamine deficiency in patients with heart failure, particularly those treated chronically with high doses of furosemide. Thiamine deficiency in patients with heart failure seems predominantly to be due to increased urine volume and urinary flow rate. There is also evidence that furosemide may directly inhibit thiamine uptake at the cellular level. Limited data suggest that thiamine supplementation is capable of increasing left ventricular ejection fraction and improving functional capacity in patients with heart failure and a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction who were treated with diuretics (predominantly furosemide). Therefore, it may be reasonable to provide such patients with thiamine supplementation during heart failure exacerbations.

### Sodium and fluid excretion with torsemide in healthy subjects is limited by the short duration of diuretic action [^113gqQyg]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Hypokalemia is a prominent adverse effect of furosemide, bumetanide, and thiazide diuretics. Torsemide does not routinely reduce serum potassium concentration (S K) and prevents thiazide‐induced K + loss in rat models. 22 Neither formulation of torsemide increased K + excretion significantly in this study. The absence of kaliuresis after torsemide administration may relate to blockade of the mineralocorticosteroid receptors 23 or reduction of aldosterone secretion. 24 The absence of hypokalemia and the high and predictable bioavailability have led to the suggestion that torsemide be the preferred loop diuretic. 7, 9, 13, 25 Indeed, subjects randomized to torsemide compared with furosemide for uncompensated CHF had a reduced rate of readmission for recurrent CHF, and a more cost‐effective treatment. 25

The remarkable and rapid development of within‐dose tolerance may underlie the modest or indeed nonsignificant increase in Na + excretion with a continuous intravenous infusion of a loop diuretic compared with an equivalent single oral dose. 26, 27 Thus, intravenous infusion is not a reliable strategy to enhance natriuresis despite continuous delivery of the diuretic to its site of action.

Furosemide given to healthy subjects reduces 24‐hour C Cr by ≈23%, 8 which is comparable to the pattern observed after torsemide IR in this study. A fall in GFR compromises the fluid and salt‐depleting actions of the diuretic. 28 The cause for the fall in GFR is unclear, 5, 11 but the GFR was better preserved after ER torsemide in this study. Whether this will translate into better preservation of renal function during long‐term therapy with torsemide ER requires further study.

Previous studies have reported that a slow‐release formulation of furosemide has a somewhat improved antihypertensive efficacy 29, 30, 31, 32, 33 but the low and variable bioavailability is worsened, which led to its discontinuation. Two ER formulations of torsemide have been developed. One was abandoned and the other improved antihypertensive efficacy only modestly and failed to improve fluid or electrolyte excretion likely because it prolonged the time to reach peak serum concentration only slightly. 34, 35, 36

### Oral semaglutide: dosage in special situations [^113ARm81]. Diabetes Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Ramadan Fasting

Ramadan fasting is characterized by month-long fasting from dawn to dusk, during which faithful believers abstain from food and water. Oral semaglutide can be taken 30–60 min before the suhur (early morning) meal, but this may be inconvenient for many. Another option is to take the drug before the iftar (evening) meal, but this will extend the fasting period by a half hour to one hour, and will not be welcome.

Another option is to take oral semaglutide half an hour before midnight snacks, which can be taken before or after Tarawih prayers. Consuming semaglutide tablet with up to half a glass of water, offering the prayer, and then taking a small snack may be an effortless way of taking the drug without intruding into one's lifestyle. It is advisable to always keep a minimum of 6 h of fasting before taking oral semaglutide to achieve the desired bioavailability.

The following key dosing instructions should also be followed during Ramadan fasting.
The drug should be taken with minimal water not exceeding 120 mL or 4 oz.
The patient should wait 30 min after taking the drug before consuming any food/drink/medication.
It is also suggested that, although a patient should wait 30 min before consuming food, the patient ideally eat a snack/food within 30–60 min after taking this drug.
It is recommended that tablet semaglutide remain in the blister pack till consumption and not be placed in a pill box.
Co-administration of oral semaglutide may have a small impact on certain drugs like metformin, furosemide, rosuvastatin, and thyroxine, and their effect should be monitored from time to time.

### Development and standardization of a furosemide stress test to predict the severity of acute kidney injury [^116AFPFy]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Because serum creatinine and oliguria are often late signs of significant AKI, more sensitive diagnostic tests are required. This clinical need has led to the development of multiple candidate AKI biomarkers. Because AKI biomarker levels change over time depending on the timing and severity of injury, a functional assessment of renal function might enhance biomarker performance. Since most common form(s) of intrinsic AKI involve acute tubular injury, we sought to develop a functional assessment of renal tubular function. Furosemide, a loop diuretic, has pharmacokinetic properties that make it an appealing functional tool. In contrast to other drugs cleared by the kidney, furosemide is not effectively filtered by the glomerulus. As an organic acid, furosemide is tightly bound to serum proteins and gains access to the tubular lumen by active secretion via the human organic anion transporter (hOAT) system in the proximal convoluted tubule. Once in the tubular lumen, furosemide inhibits luminal active chloride transport throughout the thick ascending limb of Henle, thereby preventing sodium reabsorption and resulting in natriuresis and increased urine flow. We surmised that furosemide-induced increases in urine output might be a method to assess the integrity of renal tubular function in the setting of early AKI. Specifically, we hypothesized that the kidney's response or lack of response to a furosemide challenge, as a clinical assessment of tubular function, could identify patients with severe tubular injury before it was clinically apparent (for example, a rise in creatinine). We sought to develop and standardize a furosemide stress test (FST) for patients with AKI and describe its performance characteristics.

### Pharmacokinetic evaluation of a drug transporter cocktail consisting of digoxin, furosemide, metformin, and rosuvastatin [^112AhVUK]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2016). Low credibility.

This article reports the clinical investigation of a probe drug cocktail containing substrates of key drug transporters. Single oral doses of 0.25 mg digoxin (P‐gp), 5 mg furosemide (OAT1 and OAT3), 500 mg metformin (OCT2, MATE1, and MATE2‐K), and 10 mg rosuvastatin (OATP1B1, OATP1B3, and BCRP) were administered separately or as a cocktail in a randomized six‐period crossover trial in 24 healthy male volunteers. As a cocktail, relative bioavailabilities of digoxin and metformin and furosemide AUC 0‐tz were similar to separate dosing. However, when administered as a cocktail the C max of furosemide was 19.1% lower and the C max and AUC 0‐tz of rosuvastatin were 38.6% and 43.4% higher, respectively. In addition, the effects of increased doses of metformin or furosemide on the cocktail were investigated in 11 and 12 subjects, respectively. The cocktail explored in this trial has the potential to be used for the in vivo screening of transporter‐mediated drug–drug interactions. © 2016 American Society for Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics

### Guidance for incorporating FDA processes into the ACC / AHA clinical practice guideline methodology: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^1172hB1v]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Antihypertensive medications — pharmacokinetic drug–drug interactions are detailed across absorption, metabolism, elimination, and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) effects, with specific mitigation where stated. Potassium binder (patiromer) decreases absorption of multiple antihypertensives and to mitigate this, administer the antihypertensives at least 3 h before or after taking the potassium binder. Potassium binder (sodium zirconium cyclosilicate) increases absorption of furosemide with increased clinical effects (eg, diuresis or risk of hypokalemia); the effect is diminished with separation of administration by 2 h. Iron salts decrease absorption of methyldopa leading to reduced BP lowering. CYP2D6 inhibitors increase BB concentration with enhanced clinical effects (eg, hypotension and bradycardia), and CYP3A4 inhibitors increase nondihydropyridine concentration (diltiazem, verapamil) with enhanced clinical effects. CYP3A4 inhibition via amlodipine, verapamil, or diltiazem increases calcineurin inhibitor (tacrolimus, cyclosporine) concentration with increased risk for side effects (eg, renal impairment). With eplerenone plus diltiazem there is increased risk of hypotension and hyperkalemia, and using a lower dose of eplerenone when combined with diltiazem could be considered a productive interaction. Lithium clearance is reduced by thiazide-type diuretics and RAS blockers, increasing lithium toxicity risk. Verapamil via P-gp inhibition increases dabigatran levels with a higher risk of bleeding, and verapamil or carvedilol via P-gp inhibition increases digoxin levels with a higher risk of digoxin toxicity.

### A comprehensive review of the loop diuretics: should furosemide be first line? [^112DYoKj]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the literature regarding the pharmacokinetic profiles, comparative safety and efficacy, and comparative costs of loop diuretics to evaluate the current clinical usefulness of furosemide.

Data Sources

A search of MEDLINE (1966-June 2009) was conducted using the terms furosemide, torsemide, bumetanide, ethacrynic acid, and loop diuretics. Articles were limited to those written in English.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All English-language articles identified from the data sources were reviewed. Studies were eligible if they encompassed pharmacokinetics, comparative safety and efficacy, or comparative costs of the loop diuretics.

Data Synthesis

In patients with heart failure (HF), torsemide demonstrated decreased mortality compared with furosemide in 1 study (2.2% vs 4.5% in the furosemide group; p < 0.05), decreased hospitalizations in 1 study (23 in the torsemide group vs 61 in the furosemide group; p < 0.01), and improved New York Heart Association functional classifications in 2 studies. In the first, 45.8% with torsemide versus 37.2% with furosemide demonstrated improvement in at least one functional class (p = 0.00017). In the second, 40.2% with torsemide and 30.7% with furosemide demonstrated improvement in at least one functional class (p = 0.014). In 2 of 3 studies of patients with cirrhosis, torsemide increased natriuresis and total volume diuresed compared with furosemide in patients with cirrhosis; however, no significant difference between the agents with respect to plasma renin and aldosterone concentrations was demonstrated. In patients with pulmonary hypertension, central venous pressure, capillary wedge pressure, and stroke volume significantly improved from baseline among patients who received torsemide, but not in those who received furosemide, although the intergroup analysis failed to reach statistical significance. Among patients with chronic kidney disease, no significant differences were noted with respect to natriuresis and blood pressure control between the 2 agents; however, in patients with acute kidney injury, patients who received furosemide had a significant improvement in urine output versus the torsemide group. Additionally, 2 trials comparing bumetanide with furosemide were identified, although the results were conflicting. In patients with nephrotic syndrome, bumetanide significantly improved weight loss in the first 4 weeks and in week 20, compared with furosemide. In patients with HF, significant improvement in dyspnea at rest and on exertion was exhibited in the bumetanide group, but not in the furosemide group; no significant difference was noted between the 2 groups when evaluating global assessment.

Conclusions

Growing evidence demonstrates more favorable pharmacokinetic profiles of torsemide and bumetanide compared with furosemide. Furthermore, torsemide may be more efficacious and safer than furosemide in patients with HF. A trial comparing all 3 drugs would be required to confirm torsemide as the primary loop diuretic in patients with HF, but based upon limited current evidence, we recommend torsemide over furosemide. Currently, little evidence exists to support either torsemide or bumetanide as first-line treatment over furosemide in patients with other edematous disease states.

### Sodium and fluid excretion with torsemide in healthy subjects is limited by the short duration of diuretic action [^1127wKg2]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

The prevalence of hypertension, congestive heart failure (CHF), and chronic kidney disease is increasing. 1 Cardiovascular disease is the most common cause of death and disability worldwide, 2 thereby encumbering a huge economic burden. 3 Diuretics are the first line of treatment for these common conditions. The therapeutic effect of diuretics is dependent on a loss of body Na + and fluid. 4 Thus, their effects must be predictable if the burden of cardiovascular disease is to be reduced.

Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is reduced in most subjects with edematous conditions, mandating the use of loop diuretics since these agents have the most potent acute pharmacological action of natriuresis and diuresis.

Despite their unrivaled acute natriuretic effectiveness, loop diuretics have been inadequate therapeutic agents. They are associated with several adverse effects including electrolyte and metabolic disturbances and reduction in GFR. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 Furosemide causes little reduction in blood pressure (BP) in subjects with hypertension with preserved renal function. 11, 12 Loop diuretics are usually preferred for subjects with chronic kidney disease. However, thiazides are usually preferred to treat subjects with hypertension if the GFR is not reduced. Furosemide has been shown to have poor and highly variable bioavailability that is worsened in decompensated CHF, 13, 14 and this may account, at least in part, for the unpredictable effects of furosemide in treating subjects with CHF. 14 Bumetanide is even more short acting. This has prompted suggestions that furosemide be replaced as the loop diuretic of choice by the more predictable torsemide, which is largely eliminated by the metabolism, has a high bioavailability even in subjects with CHF and chronic kidney disease, and causes little or no hypokalemia. 7, 9

### Diuretic effects of subcutaneous furosemide in human volunteers: a randomized pilot study [^112VG6zZ]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Furosemide is usually administered by the oral or intravenous route to cardiac patients with hypertension and heart failure, as well as edema. Occasionally, furosemide cannot be administered by these routes.

Objective

To evaluate the diuretic/natriuretic efficacy of subcutaneously administered furosemide in healthy volunteers.

Methods

This single-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, crossover pilot study compared the diuretic effect of subcutaneously administered furosemide and NaCl 0.9% (placebo) in 12 healthy volunteers. The study was conducted over 5 days. Baseline values were determined on day 1. On days 3 and 5, each volunteer was injected with either furosemide 20 mg (2 mL) or 2 mL of placebo subcutaneously. A washout period occurred on day 4. Fluid and dietary intake were controlled on all 3 data collection days. Primary outcome measures consisted of urine volume voided, urine sodium concentration, onset time and volume of initial urine output, and number of voids during 8 hours of urine collection.

Results

All outcomes demonstrated statistically significant differences when treatment and placebo groups were compared (p < 0.05). Adverse effects most commonly reported by the participants were minor and included transient burning and stinging at the injection site.

Conclusions

This study demonstrates that subcutaneously administered furosemide is a viable alternative when the oral or intravenous route of administration is not desirable or possible in humans. However, the results of this study need to be corroborated in various patient populations.

### Furosemide injection 80 mg / 10 mL (Furoscix) [^115wzdcU]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Furosemide primarily inhibits the reabsorption of sodium and chloride in the proximal and distal tubules and in the loop of Henle. The high degree of diuresis is largely due to the unique site of action. The action on the distal tubule is independent of any inhibitory effect on carbonic anhydrase and aldosterone.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

In patients with NYHA Class II and Class III heart failure, subcutaneous administration of FUROSCIX (30 mg furosemide over the first hour followed by 12.5 mg per hour for the subsequent 4 hours, total 80mg furosemide) produced similar diuresis and natriuresis to intravenous administration (two 40 mg bolus doses separated by 120 minutes) at 8 and 24 hour post-dose. The duration of diuretic effect with FUROSCIX is up to 8 hours after initiation of dosing.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Absorption

In patients with NYHA Class II-III congestive heart failure, subcutaneous infusion of FUROSCIX (30 mg furosemide over the first hour followed by 12.5 mg per hour for the subsequent 4 hours, 80 mg furosemide total), the bioavailability was 99.6% (90% CI: 94.8, 104.8) with a median Tmaxof 4 hours relative to 80 mg intravenous furosemide (two 40-mg bolus doses separated by 120 minutes). The pharmacokinetic parameters of FUROSCIX are presented in Table 1 below:

Table 1: Pharmacokinetic Data of FUROSCIX Following Subcutaneous Infusion (n = 15)

The terminal half-life of furosemide is approximately 2 hours.

The impact of subcutaneous edema at the administration site of FUROSCIX on drug absorption is unknown.

Distribution

Furosemide is extensively bound to plasma proteins, mainly to albumin. Plasma concentrations ranging from 1 mcg per mL to 400 mcg per mL are 91% to 99% bound in healthy individuals. The unbound fraction averages 2.3% to 4.1% at therapeutic concentrations.

Furosemide binding to albumin may be reduced in elderly patients.

Metabolism

Furosemide glucuronide is the only or at least the major biotransformation product of furosemide in man.

Elimination

Significantly more furosemide is excreted in urine following the intravenous injection than after the tablet or oral solution.

Furosemide is predominantly excreted unchanged in the urine.

The renal clearance of furosemide after intravenous administration in older healthy male subjects (60 to 70 years of age) is significantly less than in younger healthy male subjects (20 to 35 years of age).

### The added-up albumin enhances the diuretic effect of furosemide in patients with hypoalbuminemic chronic kidney disease: a randomized controlled study [^1128hQ4n]. BMC Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

It is well known that the effect of albumin binding is to trap furosemide in the plasma so it can be delivered to the kidneys as opposed to being distributed throughout the body. In the situation of hypoalbuminemia, less furosemide-albumin complex can be delivered to the kidneys. Moreover, a decline in renal perfusion (CKD in our study) also decreased the rate of drug delivery to its site of action. In addition, a low serum albumin concentration enhanced furosemide metabolism and lead to decreased tubular secretion of active diuretics. Another mechanism of albumin is favouring an enhanced vascular refilling rate which is able to promote effective reabsorption of fluid accumulation from the interstitial space, thereby inducing transient retrieval of increased effective circulating volume. In this manner, an increased renal flow is propitiated and more efficient glomerular filtration function and urine output are achieved irrespective of possible favourable effects on the pharmacodynamics of furosemide. Taken together, our findings in this study are compatible with the hypothesis that the added-up albumin may enhance the rate of furosemide-albumin complex delivery to the kidneys, assist the active metabolite of furosemide to its site of action and increase renal blood flow leading to more efficient glomerular filtration function. The effect of increased intratubular albumin which is found in severe nephrotic syndrome patients and which might blunt the response of furosemide was not prominent in our study since all the patients in our studies had 24-hour urine protein less than 3.5 g/d.

### Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic alterations in the roux-en-Y gastric bypass recipients [^1131fHa3]. Annals of Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

We conducted a pharmacokinetic (PK) study and a pharmacodynamic (PD) study to assess whether Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery is associated with significant changes to PK and PD of oral medications.

Background

The effect of RYGB on oral drug disposition is not well understood.

Methods

An oral cocktail of probe drugs for major drug-metabolizing enzymes (caffeine, tolbutamide, omeprazole, dextromethorphan, and oral and intravenous midazolam) was administered to 18 RYGB recipients and 18 controls. Timed blood and urine samples were obtained for PK analyses. Forty mg of oral furosemide was administered to 13 RYGB recipients and 14 controls, and urine and blood samples were collected for assessing furosemidePK, and urine volume and urine sodium excretion for PD analyses.

Results

Compared with controls, the RYGB group had significantly lower time to maximum plasma concentration (tmax) for caffeine (0.58 ± 0.5 vs 2.1 ± 2.2 hours, P < 0.0001), tolbutamide (1.4 ± 1.8 vs 2.1 ± 2.2 hours, P = 0.0001), omeprazole (1.1 ± 1.1 vs 4.4 ± 1.3 hours, P < 0.0001), and oral midazolam (0.5 ± 0.2 vs 0.7 ± 0.4 hours, P < 0.01). However, maximum plasma concentration, half-life, area under the curve, and oral bioavailability were not different. Compared with controls, the RYGB group had brisk natriuresis, with significantly lower tmax for urine sodium (1.3 ± 0.5 vs 3.1 ± 2.3 hours, P < 0.02) and correspondingly lower tmax for furosemide (1.8 ± 0.3 vs 4.2 ± 1.2 hours, P = 0.006). However, 6-hour urine sodium and 6-hour urine volume were not different between the two groups.

Conclusions

RYGB recipients have significantly shorter tmax for the studied orally administered medications, but otherwise no other significant changes in PK were reported.

### Inhaled furosemide for relief of air hunger versus sense of breathing effort: a randomized controlled trial [^1152maQc]. Respiratory Research (2018). Low credibility.

Suggestion of 'second dose' effect

This study shows a beneficial cumulative effect of repeated furosemide inhalations (2x40mg). Ours is the only study that has to our knowledge investigated the effect of a second dose of inhaled furosemide on experimentally induced AH in healthy individuals. We noted a significant reduction in AH ratings with the second dose of furosemide in those who had the mists in the order FSF (mean ± SEM − 10.2 ± 4.2 versus − 20.8 ± 4.6%VAS). This was not seen for saline in those who had SFS so it is unlikely to be an order effect (mean ± SEM − 6.5 ± 5.0 versus − 1.6 ± 7.9). It is possible that the first dose of furosemide sensitizes the receptors so that the second dose has an additive/cumulative effect. Another possibility is from a carry-over effect where the inhaled furosemide is still active in the lungs for up to at least an hour after the first inhalation. Supporting this theory is Morélot-Panzini et al. (2018) study reporting that the rate of systemic absorption of inhaled furosemide is inversely related to the extent of dyspnoea relief. This suggests that when the furosemide remains in the lungs, in contact with the pulmonary stretch receptors for a longer duration, the action of furosemide on dyspnoea relief is increased. An enhanced 'second dose' effect due to the pharmacokinetics is a recognized phenomenon in psychopharmocology.

The question remains whether the 'second dose' effect is related to sensitisation of stretch receptor-furosemide interaction or a carry-over effect from the first dose of furosemide due to incomplete removal of furosemide from the lungs before the second dose. In the current study the time between first furosemide mist and the second was approximately 90 min. If we accept that on average the furosemide stays within the lungs for up to 1 h based on the effect of a single dose on dyspnoea relief the length of time between the first and second dose would go against a carryover effect to explain the greater relief with the second dose. This is further supported by the fact that in the SFS group the time between the middle furosemide mist and the second saline mist was less than 1 h and the pre second saline mist AH remained below the pre first saline mist level (consistent with a carryover effect of the middle furosemide mist). We would therefore favour a sensitisation explanation to account for the bigger relief from the second dose of furosemide in the FSF group.

### Pharmacokinetic evaluation of a drug transporter cocktail consisting of digoxin, furosemide, metformin, and rosuvastatin [^112cLyvx]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2016). Low credibility.

Previous reports 12, 13, 14 indicated that increased plasma concentrations of metformin or furosemide could potentially cause interactions with the other cocktail compounds. Therefore, two further cocktail compositions were investigated. Cocktail T2 (n = 11) contained a doubled metformin dose (1,000 mg) to simulate an increase in metformin exposure if the cocktail were to be given with a potent OCT/MATE inhibitor. 23 Cocktail T3 (n = 12) contained a 4‐fold increased furosemide dose (20 mg) to simulate a corresponding increase in furosemide plasma concentrations in the presence of a potent OAT inhibitor. 24

Cocktail T2 demonstrated no further interactions compared to T1, suggesting that cocktail T1 pharmacokinetics would not be relevantly affected in the presence of OCT/MATE inhibitors. Cocktail T3 revealed a potential minor interaction with digoxin (decreases in AUC 0‐tz by 17% and C max by 11% comparing T3 vs. R, and decreases of AUC 0‐tz by 22.6% and C max by 12.2% comparing T3 vs. T1), without additionally affecting the pharmacokinetics of metformin or rosuvastatin (Tables 1, 2, 3, 4). This suggests that higher plasma concentrations of furosemide, resulting, for example, from concomitant administration of an OAT1/OAT3 inhibitor, could slightly decrease digoxin plasma concentrations.

It is difficult to derive a mechanistic basis for the decreases of digoxin AUC and C max in cocktail T3 as a result of the higher furosemide dose. Several previous studies examined the effect of furosemide on digoxin pharmacokinetics, but the results were not consistent. Both increases 25 and decreases 26 of digoxin renal excretion were reported after administration of relatively high doses of furosemide. Other groups reported the absence of relevant effects of furosemide on digoxin pharmacokinetics. 27, 28, 29, 30 In the current cocktail trial, digoxin CL R was not increased in cocktail T3, suggesting an extrarenal site of interaction. A possible explanation would be a decrease in the extent of bioavailability, which may be due to a decrease in intestinal digoxin absorption. However, the mechanistic basis for a decrease in digoxin absorption cannot be explained by available in vitro and clinical data, and as such, a definitive explanation for this effect remains to be elucidated.

### Subcutaneous furosemide in heart failure: pharmacokinetic characteristics of a newly buffered solution [^115JHe11]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2018). Low credibility.

Parenteral loop diuretics form the cornerstone of treatment of acute decompensated HF when patients respond insufficiently to oral diuretics alone. It is well known that the HF syndrome is characterized by unpredictable periods of decompensation, which require escalation of oral diuretic doses and/or frequency of dosing. When such oral treatment adjustment fails, IV diuretics are usually prescribed. Furthermore, many patients appear to temporarily have a reduced response to oral medication due to impaired absorption because of fluid overload and other factors affecting gastric and intestinal absorptive functions. Indeed, the average bioavailability after oral administration of furosemide is highly variable and has been reported to range between 49% and 72%, while individual differences range from below 20% to over 90%. Parenteral furosemide therapy not only reduces hypervolemia, but in many patients, it also restores oral bioavailability, allowing them to transition more readily back to oral maintenance therapy.

Our 2 studies show that the bioavailability of SC furosemide is complete (> 99%) and that therapeutic plasma levels are achieved soon after initiation, with peak levels generally achieved within 30 to 60 min. In the PK/PD study, we chose to administer 2 doses of 40-mg IV furosemide, 2 h apart. Although rarely used clinically, it is the recommended dosage in the furosemide injection prescribing information implemented with the first U.S. introduction in 1968. The curves show that 5 h of SC furosemide infusion results in plasma levels that are maintained in the therapeutic range for at least as long as the repeated IV administration.

The question arises as to how might a SC delivery mode for furosemide be advantageous to the patient with HF? Several patient categories may benefit from this treatment such as those hospitalized for IV diuretics who may then be discharged earlier and can then continue SC and thus parenteral diuretic administration for several additional days in the outpatient setting. Second, patients who are slowly deteriorating and not responding to dose escalation with oral furosemide may use SC furosemide. This may lessen the need for hospitalization.

### Furosemide (toxicology medicated collection system) [^113uws7C]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Edema

Furosemide tablets are indicated in adults and pediatric patients for the treatment of edema associated with congestive heart failure, cirrhosis of the liver, and renal disease, including the nephrotic syndrome. Furosemide tablets are particularly useful when an agent with greater diuretic potential is desired.

Hypertension

Oral Furosemide tablets may be used in adults for the treatment of hypertension alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents. Hypertensive patients who cannot be adequately controlled with thiazides will probably also not be adequately controlled with Furosemide tablets alone.

RESULTS

Subjects

Twenty‐four healthy white male subjects were randomized, 12 subjects in each trial part, and treated. The median age was 37.5 (range 23–49) years and the mean body mass index 25.6 kg/m 2 (standard deviation [SD] 2.1). Twenty‐two subjects completed the planned observation time according to protocol. Two subjects in trial part 1 withdrew consent for further participation, one during period 1, another after period 2. A further subject in trial part 1 did not participate in period 3 (treatment: rosuvastatin alone) at the discretion of the investigator due to a nondrug‐related adverse event (nasopharyngitis), but continued as planned with period 4. All 24 subjects (100%) were included in the randomized set and the treated set, and 23 subjects (95.8%) were included in the pharmacokinetic set (PKS). One subject from part 1 was excluded from the PKS because of too few pharmacokinetic samplings for the primary and secondary pharmacokinetic endpoints.

### Subcutaneous furosemide in heart failure: pharmacokinetic characteristics of a newly buffered solution [^114xt1LM]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2018). Low credibility.

Heart failure (HF) is a chronic disease associated with considerable morbidity, mortality, and health care expenditures. According to the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association, 5.7 million Americans were diagnosed with HF in 2012, and this number is expected to increase 46% by 2030. Patients with HF make up 11% of the Medicare population and are responsible for 34% of the total annual Medicare expenditures. Expenditures related to HF are expected to increase 127% by 2030 alone. It is noteworthy that the HF population constitutes 41.5%, 55.3%, and 49.5% of total Medicare inpatient admissions, readmissions, and admissions to skilled nursing facilities, respectively.

Although HF management has improved over the years, many patients experience repeated hospital admissions for fluid overload marked by worsening of congestive symptoms. Intravenous (IV) furosemide is the foundation of treatment for patients with decompensated HF. However, IV therapy may only be administered by a certified health care professional, typically done in emergency rooms or in a hospital setting, which limits more timely access and inherently drives up the cost of treatment.

There is a large gap between chronic oral diuretic therapy given at home versus IV diuretics administered in the naturally more expensive hospital setting. A potential intermediate step would be that of access to an "IV-like furosemide" for use outside the hospital. This would enable development of a new care model with access to a more predictable and/or intensive diuresis in the outpatient setting, thereby preventing (re-)hospitalizations and reducing length of hospital stay.

Several small studies have reported that furosemide administration via the subcutaneous (SC) route can result in significant diuresis in both healthy volunteers, as well as patients with advanced stage HF. However, furosemide is insoluble at physiological pH, and commercially available furosemide injectable products (furosemide injection USP or BP) have a pH of approximately 9.0. Alkaline products can cause significant irritation and discomfort, which currently precludes SC administration of available furosemide solutions.

A novel proprietary furosemide formulation was developed with a pH of 7.4 to minimize the risk of tissue irritation and discomfort. The aim of this report is to present the first pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic results of this novel furosemide formulation administered via the SC route using a biphasic delivery profile.

Edema

Therapy should be individualized according to patient response to gain maximal therapeutic response and to determine the minimal dose needed to maintain that response.

Adults

The usual initial dose of Furosemide tablets is 20 to 80 mg given as a single dose. Ordinarily a prompt diuresis ensues. If needed, the same dose can be administered 6 to 8 hours later or the dose may be increased. The dose may be raised by 20 or 40 mg and given not sooner than 6 to 8 hours after the previous dose until the desired diuretic effect has been obtained. The individually determined single dose should then be given once or twice daily (eg, at 8 am and 2 pm). The dose of Furosemide tablets may be carefully titrated up to 600 mg/day in patients with clinically severe edematous states.

Edema may be most efficiently and safely mobilized by giving Furosemide tablets on 2 to 4 consecutive days each week.

When doses exceeding 80 mg/day are given for prolonged periods, careful clinical observation and laboratory monitoring are particularly advisable. (See PRECAUTIONS: Laboratory Tests.)

Geriatric patients

In general, dose selection for the elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range (see PRECAUTIONS: Geriatric Use).

Pediatric patients

The usual initial dose of oral Furosemide tablets in pediatric patients is 2 mg/kg body weight, given as a single dose. If the diuretic response is not satisfactory after the initial dose, dosage may be increased by 1 or 2 mg/kg no sooner than 6 to 8 hours after the previous dose. Doses greater than 6 mg/kg body weight are not recommended. For maintenance therapy in pediatric patients, the dose should be adjusted to the minimum effective level.

### In-vivo administration of CLC-K kidney chloride channels inhibitors increases water diuresis in rats: a new drug target for hypertension? [^113dXNLe]. Journal of Hypertension (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

The human kidney-specific chloride channels ClC-Ka (rodent ClC-K1) and ClC-Kb (rodent ClC-K2) are important determinants of renal function, participating to urine concentration and blood pressure regulation mechanisms. Here we tested the hypothesis that these chloride channels could represent new drug targets for inducing diuretic and antihypertensive effects.

Methods

To this purpose, the CLC-K blockers benzofuran derivatives MT-189 and RT-93 (10, 50, 100mg/kg), were acutely administered by gavage in Wistar rats, and pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic parameters determined by functional, bioanalytical, biochemical and molecular biology assays.

Results

Plasma concentration values for MT-189 and RT-93 were indicative of good bioavailability. Both MT-189 and RT-93 dose-dependently increased urine volume without affecting electrolyte balance. A comparable reduction of SBP was observed in rats after MT-189, RT-93 or furosemide administration. Benzofuran derivatives treatment did not affect kidney CLC-K mRNA level or inner medulla osmolality, whereas a significant vasopressin-independent down-regulation of aquaporin water channel type 2 was observed at protein and transcriptional levels. In rats treated with benzofuran derivatives, the observed polyuria was mainly water diuresis; this finding indirectly supports a cross-talk between chloride and water transport in nephron. Moreover, preliminary in-vitro evaluation of the drugs capability to cross the blood-inner ear barrier suggests that these compounds have a limited ability to induce potential auditory side effects.

Conclusion

CLC-K blockers may represent a new class of drugs for the treatment of conditions associated with expanded extracellular volume, with a hopeful high therapeutic potential for hypertensive patients carrying ClC-K gain-of-function polymorphisms.

### Subcutaneous furosemide in heart failure: pharmacokinetic characteristics of a newly buffered solution [^1149U1eH]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2018). Low credibility.

For the PK/PD Pivotal study of both the IV and SC administration routes, the following pharmacokinetic parameters were determined: the peak plasma concentration (C max), the time to C max, the area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) from time 0 (pre-dose) to the last measurable plasma concentration (AUC last) and to infinity (AUC ∞), the apparent terminal phase elimination rate constant, the terminal phase elimination half-life (t ½), the apparent systemic clearance (for SC furosemide only), the systemic clearance (for IV furosemide only), the apparent systemic volume of distribution (for SC furosemide only), and the systemic volume of distribution (for IV furosemide only). The following equation was used to calculate the absolute bioavailability of SC furosemide: (AUC ∞ / dose of SC furosemide) / (AUC ∞ / dose of IV furosemide). All parameters were calculated using a noncompartmental analysis (Nuventra). In the First-in-Man study, the plasma levels were plotted for proof-of-principal evaluation.

Pharmacodynamic assessment

For the PK/PD Pivotal study of both the SC and IV administration routes, urine samples were collected from spontaneous voids during the time periods (0 to 1 h), (1 to 2 h), (2 to 4 h), (4 to 6 h), (6 to 8 h), (8 to 10 h), (10 to 12 h), (12 to 18 h), and (18 to 24 h) after initiation of each furosemide treatment. Aliquots of urine samples were processed and then stored under refrigeration until assayed for sodium concentration, and therein an excretion amount, using standard biochemistry testing.

Assessment of local tolerance

In the PK/PD study, pain was assessed on a 0 to 10 point scale with 0 representing "No Pain" and 10 representing to the "Worst Pain Imaginable". Additionally, the skin at the SC infusion site was evaluated and photographed at various time points. Erythema was scored on a 0- to 4-point scale with 0 representing "No Erythema" and 4 representing "Severe Erythema to Slight Eschar Formation". Edema formation was scored using a 0- to 4-point scale with 0 representing "No Edema" and 4 representing "Severe Edema (raised more than 1 mm and beyond exposure area)".

### Subcutaneous furosemide in heart failure: pharmacokinetic characteristics of a newly buffered solution [^112AEUE7]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2018). Low credibility.

Parenteral diuretics form the cornerstone of decongestion in heart failure. However, parenteral therapy routinely requires emergency room or inpatient care. A novel buffered furosemide formulation with neutral pH was developed to offer "hospital-strength" diuresis for outpatient use, including self-administration at home. Subcutaneous infusion using a biphasic delivery profile resulted in complete bioavailability (99.65%) and equivalent diuresis when compared with intravenous administration. Subcutaneous administration of buffered furosemide was well tolerated with no evidence of any drug-induced skin reactions. Subcutaneous infusion of buffered furosemide in the outpatient setting or home may help to reduce the burden of heart failure.

### Pharmacokinetic evaluation of a drug transporter cocktail consisting of digoxin, furosemide, metformin, and rosuvastatin [^113NQf6H]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2016). Low credibility.

The principal objective of this clinical trial was to explore the conclusions of the in vitro studies described by Ebner et al. 10 by studying the proposed four‐component transporter DDI cocktail in healthy human subjects. In this trial, using relatively low doses (cocktail T1), the relative bioavailability of each component after administration in the cocktail compared to administration of the respective component as a single entity was determined. In addition, mutual pharmacokinetic interactions were also investigated in two subgroups of volunteers, consisting of a 2‐fold increase in the dose of metformin (T2) or a 4‐fold increase in the dose of furosemide (T3).

Although the likelihood of mutual interactions between the selected probe drugs was projected to be low based on in vitro results, 10 previous reports indicated that in vivo interactions could occur with metformin or furosemide as perpetrators, in particular if plasma concentrations of the perpetrators were increased. 12, 13, 14 Such an increase could theoretically occur when the cocktail is administered together with a potent inhibitor of transporters, and therefore the T2 and T3 arms were included to investigate this potential effect.

### Sodium and fluid excretion with torsemide in healthy subjects is limited by the short duration of diuretic action [^113mgF9V]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

The main new findings from this study of healthy subjects are that a novel ER formulation of torsemide that delivers the drug into solution over 10 to 12 hours prolonged the natriuresis and diuresis and doubled the loss of fluid, body weight, and Na + without a significant fall in GFR. The diuresis was followed by sustained renal fluid and Na + retention, but this postdiuretic period was shortened after torsemide ER from ≈18 to ≈12 hours. Neither formulation led to a significant loss of potassium. The ER formulation prolonged the time to maximal plasma torsemide concentration by 3.5‐fold, with a corresponding reduction in torsemide AUC at 1 to 3 hours of 59%, but a doubling of AUC at 8 to 10 hours. The overall exposure to torsemide ER was reduced by 18%. The more gradual rise to peak renal torsemide excretion prolonged the time that the drug remained in the highly effective ascending phase of the hysteretic relationship between increase in urinary Na + excretion above basal and log renal torsemide excretion, thereby increasing Na + excreted per unit torsemide excreted (natriuretic efficiency). Thus, torsemide ER reduced postdiuretic Na + reclamation, maintained GFR, and enhanced natriuretic efficiency that together resulted in greater Na +, fluid, and body weight loss after a single dose despite a somewhat reduced bioavailability.

### Nanoparticle-based therapies in hypertension [^116NTGbq]. Hypertension (2023). Medium credibility.

ACE INHIBITORS

Captopril was the first oral ACE inhibitor for treating hypertension. Despite high solubility, its poor oral bioavailability results in short, sometimes irregular therapeutic activity. To overcome these shortcomings, multiwalled lipid-core nanocapsules were developed to deliver captopril or captopril plus the loop-diuretic, furosemide. After oral gavage of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) with the formulation for 5 days, captopril-nanoformulation reduced BP for 10 hours versus 8 hours for captopril-alone. However, when combined with furosemide, nanoformulations maintained BP reduction for > 20 hours. In addition to impact on BP, toxicology and serum analyses displayed no significant signs of hepatotoxicity or nephrotoxicity. Macroscopic liver, kidney, spleen, lungs, and heart analyses also showed no alterations. Animals treated with both captopril-nanoformulation and the nanoformulation+furosemide showed significant brain weight increases, suggesting some neuroprotection is provided by BP improvements, given that reduced brain weight is characteristic of SHR.

Another ACE inhibitor candidate for improved formulation is ramipril. Unlike captopril, it is poorly soluble, but similarly exhibits poor bioavailability (28%–35%) and poor gastrointestinal absorption. Using lecithin/chitosan nanoparticles as a ramipril carrier, and a ramipril nanoformulation+beta-cyclodextrin, antihypertensive properties were evaluated in deoxycorticosterone acetate salt–induced hypertensive rats. Ramipril nanoformulation and ramipril+beta-cyclodextrin reduced BP by 41.2% and 43.5%, respectively, versus 26.8% reduction with ramipril solution. Furthermore, 24 hours postdose, nanoformulations maintained 32% BP reduction, while ramipril solution showed only 11.6% reduction, suggesting both improved bioavailability and sustained efficacy. This effect may have been due to improved drug uptake resulting from improved solubility.

### Pharmacokinetic evaluation of a drug transporter cocktail consisting of digoxin, furosemide, metformin, and rosuvastatin [^113zLsNK]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2016). Low credibility.

Trial objectives, design, and treatments

The primary objective was to determine the relative bioavailabilities of digoxin, furosemide, metformin, and rosuvastatin given together as a test cocktail (T1) compared to when given individually as reference treatments. Secondary objectives were: to determine the relative bioavailabilities of digoxin, furosemide, and rosuvastatin administered as an additional test cocktail (T2) that consisted of a 2‐fold higher dose of metformin compared to T1; to determine the relative bioavailabilities of digoxin, metformin, and rosuvastatin administered as an additional test cocktail (T3) that consisted of a 4‐fold higher dose of furosemide compared to T1; to assess safety and tolerability.

This was a randomized, single‐center, open‐label, six‐period, six‐sequence crossover trial in healthy male subjects consisting of two parts with 12 subjects each. In both trial parts, the following treatments were administered according to one of the randomly assigned five treatment sequences:
0.25 mg digoxin (Lanicor, 0.25 mg film coated tablet, Teofarma, Italy),
5 mg furosemide given as 0.5 mL of a 10 mg/mL oral solution (Lasix liquidum, 5 mg, Sanofi‐Aventis Deutschland, Germany)
500 mg metformin hydrochloride (Glucophage, 500 mg, film‐coated tablet, Merck Serono, Germany)
10 mg rosuvastatin (Crestor, 10 mg film coated tablet, AstraZeneca, Germany)
test cocktail T1 comprising the 4‐fold combination of digoxin, furosemide, metformin, and rosuvastatin at the previously stated doses

Additionally, test cocktail T2 differed from T1 only in the dose of metformin hydrochloride, which was doubled to 1,000 mg. Part 2 was in general identical to part 1, with the exception that test cocktail T2 was replaced with test cocktail T3. T3 differed from T1 only in the dose of furosemide, which was increased 4‐fold to 20 mg. Details of treatments and sequences are provided in Table S4. Treatments were separated by a washout period of at least 12 days.

Transporters, expressed in various tissues, govern the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of drugs, and consequently their inherent safety and efficacy profiles. Drugs may interact with a transporter as a substrate and/or an inhibitor. Understanding transporter-mediated drug-drug interactions (DDIs), in addition to enzyme-mediated DDIs, is an integral part of risk assessment in drug development and regulatory review because the concomitant use of more than one medication in patients is common.

### Furosemide, benzalkonium chloride (UDSxMP medicated system) [^1168UYgY]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Investigations into the mode of action of furosemide have utilized micropuncture studies in rats, stop flow experiments in dogs and various clearance studies in both humans and experimental animals. It has been demonstrated that furosemide inhibits primarily the absorption of sodium and chloride not only in the proximal and distal tubules but also in the loop of Henle. The high degree of efficacy is largely due to the unique site of action. The action on the distal tubule is independent of any inhibitory effect on carbonic anhydrase and aldosterone.

Recent evidence suggests that furosemide glucuronide is the only or at least the major biotransformation product of furosemide in man. Furosemide is extensively bound to plasma proteins, mainly to albumin. Plasma concentrations ranging from 1 to 400 mcg/mL are 91 to 99% bound in healthy individuals. The unbound fraction averages 2.3 to 4.1% at therapeutic concentrations.

The onset of diuresis following oral administration is within 1 hour. The peak effect occurs within the first or second hour. The duration of diuretic effect is 6 to 8 hours.

In fasted normal men, the mean bioavailability of furosemide from furosemide tablets and furosemide oral solution is 64% and 60%, respectively, of that from an intravenous injection of the drug. Although furosemide is more rapidly absorbed from the oral solution (50 minutes) than from the tablet (87 minutes), peak plasma levels and area under the plasma concentration-time curves do not differ significantly. Peak plasma concentrations increase with increasing dose but times-to-peak do not differ among doses. The terminal half-life of furosemide is approximately 2 hours.

Significantly more furosemide is excreted in urine following the IV injection than after the tablet or oral solution. There are no significant differences between the two oral formulations in the amount of unchanged drug excreted in urine.

Geriatric Population

Furosemide binding to albumin may be reduced in elderly patients. Furosemide is predominantly excreted unchanged in the urine. The renal clearance of furosemide after intravenous administration in older healthy male subjects (60 to 70 years of age) is statistically significantly smaller than in younger healthy male subjects (20 to 35 years of age). The initial diuretic effect of furosemide in older subjects is decreased relative to younger subjects (see PRECAUTIONS: Geriatric Use).

### Subcutaneous furosemide in heart failure: pharmacokinetic characteristics of a newly buffered solution [^111cLdJ9]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2018). Low credibility.

Follow-up

For the PK/PD Pivotal study, clinical follow-up was scheduled per protocol at 7 ± 1 day from discharge and included changes in physical status (physical exam and electrocardiogram), HF symptoms, concomitant medications, and the occurrence of adverse or serious adverse events. The monitoring of the PK/PD study was overseen by an independent clinical research organization (Cardiovascular Clinical Studies, Boston, Massachusetts).

Sample size calculation and statistical analysis

Assuming the average coefficients of variation for furosemide AUC ∞ following a 20-mg dose administered by the IV, oral, and sublingual routes are 50%, 25%, and 33%, respectively, and assuming the relative bioavailability is equal to unity and the intrasubject variability for AUC would fall within 25% to 50%, a sample size of 16 subjects completing the PK/PD Pivotal study in each treatment group would provide reasonably precise estimates of the systemic exposure of furosemide (AUC and C max).

All pharmacokinetic analyses of the PK/PD Pivotal study were performed by Nuventra using Phoenix WinNonlin 6.3 (Pharsight, St. Louis, Missouri). Furosemide concentrations were tabulated by treatment group and summarized for each sampling time points as descriptive statistics (mean, SD, coefficient of variation, median, minimum, and maximum). For the calculation of mean concentrations and mean concentration–time profiles, all below the limit of quantification values were set to zero except when a subject fell between 2 quantifiable values, in which case it was treated as missing data.

An analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed on the ln-transformed furosemide AUC last and AUC ∞ to assess the difference in overall systemic exposure between the IV and SC furosemide treatments. The ANOVA model included treatment as a fixed effect, and subject as a random effect. Each ANOVA included the calculation of least squares means (LSM) and the difference between treatment LSM. The 90% confidence intervals (CIs) for the ratios were derived by exponentiation of the CIs obtained for the difference between treatment LSM (SC furosemide/IV furosemide) resulting from the analyses on the furosemide ln-transformed AUC last and AUC ∞. A p value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The statistical analysis was performed by an independent clinical research organization (Nuventra). The first-in-man study was a proof-of-concept study to gain initial experience with SC administration of the novel formulation. No formal statistical analysis was applied, and the number of participants was based on empirical considerations.

### Open-label randomized trial of torsemide compared with furosemide therapy for patients with heart failure [^1121S2t8]. The American Journal of Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Purpose

Because the bioavailability of oral furosemide is erratic and often incomplete, we tested the hypothesis that patients with heart failure who were treated with torsemide, a predictably absorbed diuretic, would have more favorable clinical outcomes than would those treated with furosemide.

Patients and Methods

We conducted an open-label trial of 234 patients with chronic heart failure (mean [± SD] age, 64 ± 11 years) from an urban public health care system. Patients received oral torsemide (n = 113) or furosemide (n = 121) for 1 year. The primary endpoint was readmission to the hospital for heart failure. Secondary endpoints included readmission for all cardiovascular causes and for all causes, numbers of hospital days, and health-related quality of life.

Results

Compared with furosemide-treated patients, torsemide-treated patients were less likely to need readmission for heart failure (39 [32%] vs. 19 [17%], P < 0.01) or for all cardiovascular causes (71 [59%] vs. 50 [44%], P = 0.03). There was no difference in the rate of admissions for all causes (92 [76%] vs. 80 [71%], P = 0.36). Patients treated with torsemide had significantly fewer hospital days for heart failure (106 vs. 296 days, P = 0.02). Improvements in dyspnea and fatigue scores from baseline were greater among patients treated with torsemide, but the differences were statistically significant only for fatigue scores at months 2, 8, and 12.

Conclusions

Compared with furosemide-treated patients, torsemide-treated patients were less likely to be readmitted for heart failure and for all cardiovascular causes, and were less fatigued. If our results are confirmed by blinded trials, torsemide may be the preferred loop diuretic for patients with chronic heart failure.

Figure 1
Plasma Furosemide Levels Following Oral and SC Administration (First-in-Man Study)

All subjects achieved therapeutic plasma furosemide levels of over 1,000 ng/ml within 1 h after subcutaneous (SC) administration, which were maintained for at least 5 h.

In the PK/PD Pivotal study, a total of 17 subjects were enrolled, but 1 subject that was randomized to receive IV furosemide first was withdrawn by the investigators before the start of drug administration. All remaining subjects (n = 16) completed the cross-over treatments, and complete pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamic, and safety data were available for all subjects. One subject was found to have an unexplained high concentration of furosemide in a pre-dose sample (927.6 ng/ml, > 35% of C max). In accordance with Food and Drug Administration guidance, the subject was excluded from the analyses because the pre-dose concentration was > 5% of C max. Therefore, 15 subjects were included in the pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and statistical analyses. The mean age of the participants (n = 15) was 68 ± 9.6 years, 93.3% were male, and 86.7% were in NYHA functional class II. Overall, 100% of subjects had hypertension, 80.0% had various arrhythmias, 70.6% had history of acute myocardial infarction, and 40.0% had diabetes (Table 1).

Pharmacokinetics

The time course of plasma furosemide concentrations for both the IV and SC administration routes are presented in Figure 2. Following IV administration, the mean furosemide concentrations were highest after the first (7,650 ± 2,050 ng/ml) and second (8,340 ± 2,290 ng/ml) IV bolus injections, for a median t max of 125 min (range 5 to 125 min) and a geometric mean C max of 8,270 ng/ml. The geometric mean AUC last and AUC ∞ estimates were 12,400 and 12,600 h ∙ ng/ml, respectively, the geometric mean of the t ½ estimates was 151.8 min, and therapeutic levels of furosemide of 1,000 ng/ml were maintained for 90 and 240 min after the first and second IV bolus injections, respectively. All subjects receiving IV furosemide had quantifiable concentrations of furosemide up to 16 h post-dose. The summary statistics of noncompartmental pharmacokinetic parameters for the IV furosemide administration are presented in Table 2.

### Practical outpatient management of worsening chronic heart failure [^111pjgDm]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2022). Medium credibility.

The principal pharmacological properties (including site of action) of the various diuretic classes are presented in Table 1 and Figure 1. In this review, we will not address the use of acetazolamide and amiloride, being less documented, not routinely available in clinical practice in many countries and recently overviewed in detail somewhere else.

Table 1
Principal pharmacological properties of drugs with diuretic effects

Figure 1
Nephron sites and target ion channels with approximate natriuresis/diuresis effect of the various diuretic classes. Cl, chloride; ENaC, epithelial sodium channel; GFR, glomerular filtration rate; K, potassium; IV, intravenous; Na, sodium; RAAS, renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system; SE, side effect; SGLT2, sodium–glucose cotransporter 2.

The most potent diuretic class includes loop diuretics, with the effect of WHF on their dose–response curve presented in Figure 2. In the context of WHF and the consequent reduced bioavailability of oral loop diuretics, guidelines recommend the use of IV loop diureticsto rapidly and more efficiently achieve a natriuretic ceiling. Different loop diuretics exist and they have different pharmacokinetics and bioavailability; a large (∼6000 participants to be enrolled) ongoing trial is comparing oral torasemide to furosemide as treatment for congestion at the time of discharge from an episode of HF (TRANSFORM‐HF, NCT03296813) following the favourable effect of torasemide on HF hospitalizations suggested in observational studies and the meta‐analysis of small trials.

Figure 2
Shift in dose–response relation to furosemide in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF). Renal function (as measured by estimated glomerular filtration rate) has an important impact on the dose–response curve to furosemide: Higher dosing is needed for lower estimated glomerular filtration rate. This is the underlying reason of the right shift observed for patients with CHF and cardiorenal syndrome and/or chronic kidney disease (CKD) (orange curve). IV, intravenous. Adapted from Brater

Thiazide‐like diuretics can be used in severe HF patients who responded poorly to loop diuretics in a sequential nephron blockade strategy. These diuretic agents potentialize the natriuretic effect of loop diuretics (Figure 1) and in the case of oral and IV metolazone remain effective with reduced filtration rate (< 30 ml/min/1.73 m 2). This effect can significantly increase diuresis and should be closely monitored with serum potassium and sodium measurements.

### Subcutaneous furosemide in heart failure: pharmacokinetic characteristics of a newly buffered solution [^112ESG2x]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusions

The SC administration of a novel buffered furosemide formulation is feasible and safe, and achieves diuresis equivalent to conventional IV furosemide. SC furosemide may offer a new therapeutic modality for outpatient use with equivalent diuresis to hospital- or emergency room–administered IV diuretics.

Perspectives

COMPETENCY IN MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE: Furosemide is the cornerstone of heart failure treatment. Because many patients become unresponsive to oral medication, they often are hospitalized for parenteral furosemide. Subcutaneous administration of a novel formulation of furosemide with a physiological pH appears feasible and safe, has complete bioavailability, and results in therapeutic diuresis as conventional intravenous furosemide. An outpatient strategy of subcutaneous furosemide therapy may help reduce the burden of heart failure by reducing the need for inpatient care.

TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK: Additional studies that mirror real-word clinical use will be required to determine the role of subcutaneous furosemide in routine management of heart failure. Such studies may investigate its role in reducing index and readmission hospitalizations for heart failure, the length of in-hospital stay, costs of care, and to better understand the risks associated with at-home treatment of mild or moderate decompensated heart failure as compared with the current in-hospital use of IV furosemide. Particular areas of interest and future clinical investigation include: patient selection criteria; parameters to determine the efficacy or the failure of this approach; clinical and laboratory monitoring protocols; when to initiate transition to oral furosemide; and the use of potassium supplementation.

### Furosemide (Lasix) [^114BbqYW]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Investigations into the mode of action of LASIX have utilized micropuncture studies in rats, stop flow experiments in dogs and various clearance studies in both humans and experimental animals. It has been demonstrated that LASIX inhibits primarily the absorption of sodium and chloride not only in the proximal and distal tubu but also in the loop of Henle. The high degree of efficacy is largely due to the unique site of action. The action on the distal tubule is independent of any inhibitory effect on carbonic anhydrase and aldosterone.

Recent evidence suggests that furosemide glucuronide is the only or at least the major biotransformation product of furosemide in man. Furosemide is extensively bound to plasma proteins, mainly to albumin. Plasma concentrations ranging from 1 μg/mL to 400 μg/mL are 91% to 99% bound in healthy individuals. The unbound fraction averages 2.3% to 4.1% at therapeutic concentrations.

The onset of diuresis following oral administration is within 1 hour. The peak effect occurs within the first or second hour. The duration of diuretic effect is 6 to 8 hours.

In fasted normal men, the mean bioavailability of furosemide from LASIX Tablets and LASIX Oral Solution is 64% and 60%, respectively, of that from an intravenous injection of the drug. Although furosemide is more rapidly absorbed from the oral solution (50 minutes) than from the tablet (87 minutes), peak plasma levels and area under the plasma concentration-time curves do not differ significantly. Peak plasma concentrations increase with increasing dose but times-to-peak do not differ among doses. The terminal half-life of furosemide is approximately 2 hours.

Significantly more furosemide is excreted in urine following the IV injection than after the tablet or oral solution. There are no significant differences between the two oral formulations in the amount of unchanged drug excreted in urine.

Geriatric Population

Furosemide binding to albumin may be reduced in elderly patients. Furosemide is predominantly excreted unchanged in the urine. The renal clearance of furosemide after intravenous administration in older healthy male subjects (60 to 70 years of age) is statistically significantly smaller than in younger healthy male subjects (20 to 35 years of age). The initial diuretic effect of furosemide in older subjects is decreased relative to younger subjects (s ee PRECAUTIONS: Geriatric Use).

### Sodium and fluid excretion with torsemide in healthy subjects is limited by the short duration of diuretic action [^113V4dHk]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusions

An ER formulation of torsemide that increases drug delivery into solution from 2 to 12 hours doubled daily fluid and Na + loss and mitigated significant reductions in GFR. Further studies over a more prolonged period in target patient populations will be required to test whether these short‐term beneficial effects in healthy subjects translate into enhanced therapeutic efficacy.

### Subcutaneous furosemide in heart failure: pharmacokinetic characteristics of a newly buffered solution [^114Ca12X]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2018). Low credibility.

Methods

Subjects and study design

This article reports on 2 separate studies designed to: 1) characterize the pharmacokinetic profile of a novel formulation of furosemide administered SC and measure the resulting diuresis and natriuresis; and 2) estimate the bioavailability of SC furosemide compared with an equivalent dose of oral or IV furosemide in subjects with chronic stable HF.

In the first study, a first-in-man, proof-of-concept study (FUROPHARM-HF [Furosemide Pharmacodynamics and Pharmacokinetics After Subcutaneous or Oral Administration]), eligible subjects (n = 10) were randomized (1:1) to receive 80 mg of oral furosemide (Lasix, Sanofi Belgium, Diegem, Belgium) or 80 mg (8 mg/ml in 10 ml) of a novel furosemide buffered solution administered SC with an external infusion pump using a biphasic pattern (30 mg over the first 60 min followed by 12.5 mg/h for 4 h). After a 14-day fluid re-equilibration washout, all subjects received the alternate treatment. Plasma furosemide levels were evaluated over 8 h.

In the second study (PK/PD Pivotal study) (Crossover Study to Compare the Pharmacokinetics and Bioavailability of a Novel Furosemide Regimen Administered Subcutaneously vs. the Same Dose Administered Intravenously in Subjects With Chronic Heart Failure;), eligible subjects (n = 16) were randomized (1:1) to receive 80 mg of furosemide administered IV (40 mg over 2 min followed by a second 40-mg dose 2 h later) or 80 mg (8 mg/ml in 10 ml) of a novel furosemide buffered solution administered SC with an external infusion pump using a biphasic pattern (30 mg over the first 60 min followed by 12.5 mg/h for 4 h). After a 7-day fluid re-equilibration washout, all subjects received the alternate treatment. During the course of both studies, all subjects discontinued oral furosemide therapy at least 24 h before the administration of the study treatment. Furosemide therapy was reinitiated at the end of each study period.

### Pathophysiology of diuretic resistance and its implications for the management of chronic heart failure [^116BRcXA]. Hypertension (2020). Medium credibility.

Diuretic resistance implies a failure to increase fluid and sodium (Na +) output sufficiently to relieve volume overload, edema, or congestion, despite escalating doses of a loop diuretic to a ceiling level (80 mg of furosemide once or twice daily or greater in those with reduced glomerular filtration rate or heart failure). It is a major cause of recurrent hospitalizations in patients with chronic heart failure and predicts death but is difficult to diagnose unequivocally. Pharmacokinetic mechanisms include the low and variable bioavailability of furosemide and the short duration of all loop diuretics that provides time for the kidneys to restore diuretic-induced Na + losses between doses. Pathophysiological mechanisms of diuretic resistance include an inappropriately high daily salt intake that exceeds the acute diuretic-induced salt loss, hyponatremia or hypokalemic, hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis, and reflex activation of the renal nerves. Nephron mechanisms include tubular tolerance that can develop even during the time that the renal tubules are exposed to a single dose of diuretic, or enhanced reabsorption in the proximal tubule that limits delivery to the loop, or an adaptive increase in reabsorption in the downstream distal tubule and collecting ducts that offsets ongoing blockade of Na + reabsorption in the loop of Henle. These provide rationales for novel strategies including the concurrent use of diuretics that block these nephron segments and even sequential nephron blockade with multiple diuretics and aquaretics combined in severely diuretic-resistant patients with heart failure.

### Subcutaneous furosemide in heart failure: pharmacokinetic characteristics of a newly buffered solution [^116ccGNa]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

Herein, we report on 2 studies that provide the first experiences with a novel injectable furosemide formulation suitable for SC infusion. The First-in-Man study was primarily designed to test the feasibility of a novel 80-mg buffered furosemide solution administered via the SC route in subjects with HF and chronic fluid overload. The main findings were: 1) SC furosemide using a biphasic delivery profile resulted in therapeutic levels within 30 min, which were maintained for the entire drug administration period (5 h) within a narrow therapeutic (diuretic) concentration range; and 2) SC furosemide was well tolerated with minimal erythema and edema at the site of injection. The PK/PD Pivotal study was designed to characterize the pharmacokinetics of the 80-mg buffered furosemide solution administered via the SC route and to estimate the bioavailability of SC furosemide compared with an equivalent 80-mg dose of IV furosemide in a similar subject population. The main findings of this study were: 1) typical therapeutic levels of furosemide were reached within 30 min of SC administration and maintained for more than 5 h; 2) absolute bioavailability of SC furosemide was complete at 99.65%; 3) SC furosemide was as effective as IV furosemide in achieving diuresis; and 4) SC furosemide was well tolerated, with minimal erythema and edema at the site of injection. These results suggest that SC furosemide administration may offer a "hospital-strength" diuretic option for patients with HF who require a shift of their oral diuretic treatment, when hospitalization is not strictly warranted. These results also suggest that the reformulation combined with the slow infusion rate has resulted in a product that is free from the stinging and discomfort that had been reported with the administration of conventional furosemide (furosemide injection USP).

Data

Animal Data

The effects of furosemide on embryonic and fetal development and on pregnant dams were studied in mice, rats, and rabbits.

Furosemide caused unexplained maternal deaths and abortions in the rabbit at the lowest dose of 25 mg/kg (approximately 4 times the human i.v. dose of 80 mg based on BSA and oral bioavailability corrections). In another study, a dose of 50 mg/kg (approximately 7 times a human i.v. dose of 80 mg based on BSA and oral bioavailability corrections) also caused maternal deaths and abortions when administered to rabbits between Days 12 and 17 of gestation. In a third study, none of the pregnant rabbits survived an oral dose of 100 mg/kg. Data from the above studies indicate fetal lethality that can precede maternal deaths.

The results of the mouse study and one of the three rabbit studies also showed an increased incidence and severity of hydronephrosis (distention of the renal pelvis and, in some cases, of the ureters) in fetuses of treated dams as compared with the incidence of fetuses from the control group.

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

The presence of furosemide has been reported in human breast milk. There are no data on the effects on the breastfed infant or the effects on milk production. Doses of furosemide associated with clinically significant diuresis may impair milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for furosemide and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from furosemide or from the underlying maternal condition.

8.4 Pediatric Use

Safety and efficacy for pediatric use have not been established [see Indications and Usage (1)].

Furosemide

Geometric mean plasma concentration–time profiles of furosemide when given alone or as a component of test cocktails T1 and T2 are shown in Figures 1 and S1, and the pharmacokinetic parameters in Table 2. Plasma concentration maxima occurred at a median t max of 40 minutes to 1 hour after all treatments, and the urinary excretion parameters fe 0‐36 and CL R,0‐36 were comparable between the treatments (Table S1). Graphical comparisons of individual and geometric mean AUC 0‐tz and C max values are given in Figure S3.

Relative bioavailability of furosemide in cocktails T1 and T2 compared to dosing alone was close to 100% for both AUC 0‐tz and AUC 0‐∞, and the 90% CIs were within the BE acceptance range (Table 2). However, geometric mean C max of furosemide in cocktails T1 and T2 was 19.1% and 21.4% lower, respectively, than that of furosemide alone, and the lower 90% CIs were below the lower BE limit. AUC 0‐tz and C max of furosemide were 4.0 and 3.1 times higher, respectively, in cocktail T3 (20 mg furosemide dose) compared to furosemide alone (5 mg dose) (Table S2).

### Sodium and fluid excretion with torsemide in healthy subjects is limited by the short duration of diuretic action [^115Bwion]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Loop diuretics are highly natriuretic but their short duration of action permits postdiuretic sodium retention, which limits salt loss unless dietary salt is severely restricted. We tested the hypothesis that a more prolonged duration of action would enhance salt loss.

Methods and Results

Ten healthy participants were crossed over between 20 mg of oral immediate‐release or extended‐release torsemide while consuming a fixed diet with 300 mmol·d −1 of Na +. Compared with immediate‐release, plasma torsemide afterwas 59% lower at 1 to 3 hours but 97% higher at 8 to 10 hours as a result of a > 3‐fold prolongation of time to maximal plasma concentrations. The relationship of natriuresis to log torsemide excretion showed marked hysteresis, but participants spent twice as long with effective concentrations of torsemide after, thereby enhancing diuretic efficiency. Compared with immediate‐release, torsemide did not reduce creatinine clearance and increased fluid (1634 ± 385 versus 728 ± 445 mL, P < 0.02) and Na + output (98 ± 15 versus 42 ± 17 mmol, P < 0.05) despite an 18% reduction in exposure. Neither formulation increased K + excretion.

Conclusions

Torsemideprolongs urine drug levels, thereby increasing the time spent with effective drug concentrations, reduces postdiuretic Na + retention, and moderates a fall in glomerular filtration rate. It caused significant Na + loss even during very high salt intake. Thus, a short duration of action limits salt loss with loop diuretics. These conclusions warrant testing in subjects with edema and heart failure.

### A double-blind randomized crossover trial of two loop diuretics in chronic kidney disease [^112Nfipu]. Kidney International (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Torsemide has predictable absorption compared to furosemide. Thereby, torsemide results in more constant exposure to active drug. Our hypothesis was that this pharmacokinetic difference between these commonly used loop diuretics may translate into disparate antihypertensive responses in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD).

Methods

We conducted a randomized, double-blind, two-period, crossover trial to compare the pharmacodynamics of torsemide and furosemide, in 14 subjects with stage 2 or 3 CKD. We first performed an inpatient study, where after the subjects were brought into sodium balance on a 200 mEq per day diet, a single bioequivalent dose of oral loop diuretic was administered with an intervening washout period. Measurements of urinary electrolytes were made. Subjects then participated in an outpatient study, wherein they received daily therapy for 3 weeks with the loop diuretics in random order. Twenty four-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring was performed before and after each drug to assess the antihypertensive response.

Results

In the inpatient phase, furosemide increased urinary sodium excretion from average (± SD) 199 ± 49 mEq/day to 357 ± 96 mEq/day and torsemide increased urinary sodium excretion from 213 ± 79 mEq/day to 398 ± 142 mEq/day. These differences between the diuretics were not significant, confirming bioequivalence. In the outpatient phase, furosemide reduced 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure from 147 ± 17/78 ± 11 mm Hg to 138 ± 21/74 ± 12 mm Hg (P = 0.021) and torsemide reduced it from 143 ± 18/75 ± 10 mm Hg to 133 ± 19/71 ± 10 mm Hg (P = 0.007). Although each diuretic was effective in reducing ambulatory blood pressure, the differences between diuretics were not statistically significant.

Conclusion

Bioequivalent doses of torsemide and furosemide given in a randomized, double-blind design fail to demonstrate superiority of torsemide with respect to natriuresis or 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure control in subjects with stages 2 and 3 CKD.

Renovascular hypertension — interventions during ACEI renography: Although captopril has been the most widely used ACEI, captopril and enalaprilat are both acceptable; the recommended dose of captopril is 25–50 mg by mouth, tablets may be crushed and dissolved in 150–250 mL water to enhance absorption, patients should not eat a solid meal within 4 h of the study, and the radiopharmaceutical should be administered 60 min after captopril administration. Enalaprilat can also be used, with a recommended dose of 40 μg/kg administered intravenously over 3–5 min with a maximum administered dose of 2.5 mg, radiopharmaceutical administration should be delayed at least 15 min after enalaprilat administration, and an intravenous line is recommended. Administration of furosemide with captopril or enalaprilat is not considered to be an essential component of ACEI renography, but because it can wash radiotracer from the distal nephron and potentially increase test sensitivity and specificity, one approach is to administer 20 mg furosemide at the beginning of the baseline study.

### Pharmacokinetic evaluation of a drug transporter cocktail consisting of digoxin, furosemide, metformin, and rosuvastatin [^116yY3Yz]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2016). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

This clinical investigation in healthy subjects represents further development of a four‐component transporter DDI cocktail that was initially proposed from an exhaustive in vitro evaluation. 10 The selection of these specific four probe drugs and their doses, i.e. digoxin (0.25 mg), furosemide (5 mg), metformin (500 mg), and rosuvastatin (10 mg), was also based on their sensitivity to coadministered inhibitors of the respective transporters in previous clinical trials, expected general clinical safety, and broad commercial availability. It was considered important that the probe drugs are not substantially metabolized, as this would complicate interpretation of DDI with coadministered inhibitors of both drug transporters and metabolizing enzymes.

The relative bioavailabilities of the substrates in cocktail T1 compared to when each drug was administered alone were unchanged for metformin and digoxin. Furosemide C max showed a slight (19%) decrease in cocktail T1, which is consistent with a previous report of a 31% and 12% decrease in furosemide C max and AUC, respectively, following concomitant administration of metformin. 12 The slight decrease in furosemide C max observed could therefore be caused by coadministration with metformin. Interestingly, the C max of furosemide decreased in both cocktails T1 and T2, whereas AUC 0‐tz and AUC 0‐∞ did not relevantly change, suggesting that the underlying mechanism is rather a reduction in the rate of intestinal furosemide absorption as opposed to a change in the extent of bioavailability. This is corroborated by results of cocktail T3, in which, after a 4‐fold dose (20 mg) of furosemide, AUC 0‐tz showed a 4‐fold increase as compared to the reference dose (5 mg), whereas furosemide C max increased less than dose‐proportionally (see Table S2). Moreover, urinary PK data indicate an extrarenal mechanism of interaction, as no relevant change of furosemide CL R was observed in cocktails T1 and T3 as compared to monotreatment (see Table S1). This is of particular importance given that furosemide is intended as probe drug substrate for renal transporters OAT1 and OAT3. Therefore, the sensitivity of furosemide as in vivo indicator of renal OAT modulators should not be influenced by the slight decrease of furosemide C max observed in the cocktail.
