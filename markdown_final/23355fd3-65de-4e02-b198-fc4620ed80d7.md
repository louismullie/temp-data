## Question

How should tumor lysis syndrome be treated when hyperphosphatemia is present?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to treat tumor lysis syndrome when hyperphosphatemia is present. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming established TLS and assessing immediate risks. Then, I should verify contraindications and stabilize, especially before urate-lowering therapy. Next, I will examine hydration as the cornerstone, followed by targeted phosphate control with binders and early consideration of renal replacement therapy. After that, I need to review parallel electrolyte management, particularly cautious calcium use, then uric acid control with rasburicase. Finally, I should confirm the monitoring cadence, reinforce what to avoid, consider diagnostic pitfalls like pseudohyperphosphatemia, and ensure multidisciplinary follow-up and secondary prophylaxis [^112qtpwj] [^111d7xVS].

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and severity so I do not miss life-threatening complications. Established TLS requires at least two laboratory abnormalities among hyperuricemia, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, and hypocalcemia, with or without clinical sequelae such as acute kidney injury, seizures, or arrhythmias, and the Cairo–Bishop framework remains useful at the bedside for classification and timing relative to cytotoxic therapy, although I should double-check baseline values to avoid misclassification in preexisting CKD or electrolyte disorders [^112qtpwj] [^111d7xVS] [^116i6XAs]. I need to obtain an ECG promptly, institute seizure precautions if calcium is low with symptoms, evaluate urine output and creatinine trajectory, and triage to higher level of care if any instability is present [^112qtpwj].

> Wait, let me verify medication and genetic contraindications before initiating specific therapies. I should confirm G6PD status prior to rasburicase to avoid hemolysis or methemoglobinemia, and if G6PD deficiency is present I must withhold rasburicase and manage with fluids, allopurinol, and close monitoring instead [^111LPALh]. I need to ensure that no sodium phosphate–containing preparations are being used for bowel prep or supplementation because these are contraindicated when phosphorus is elevated or calcium is low, and they can worsen hyperphosphatemia and hypocalcemia in TLS [^116X9mE7] [^116AyZMa].

> Hold on, I should verify that aggressive hydration is started immediately because it is the cornerstone of preventing crystal deposition and enhancing renal excretion. I will use isotonic saline rather than lactated Ringer's in the setting of hyperkalemia, targeting urine output of at least 100 mL per hour if feasible, and I will continue for approximately 2 days before and 2–3 days after cytoreductive therapy while carefully avoiding fluid overload in patients with cardiac or renal compromise [^112LMBu6] [^112qtpwj]. If urine output is inadequate despite euvolemia, I will reassess for obstruction or evolving AKI and consider cautious loop diuretics to maintain balance, avoiding thiazides that raise uric acid, but I need to re-evaluate frequently to prevent volume-related complications [^112LMBu6].

> Next, I should review targeted control of hyperphosphatemia, and I need to ensure I prioritize non–calcium-based binders to avoid calcium phosphate precipitation. Sevelamer is a reasonable first-line oral binder in TLS-related hyperphosphatemia, with lanthanum as an alternative, and I should monitor serum phosphate every 4–6 hours initially to ensure a downward trend as hydration and binder therapy take effect [^112LMBu6]. Let me consider broader guideline consistency: KDIGO recommends initiating phosphate-lowering strategies when levels are progressively or persistently elevated and also advises restricting calcium-based binders when using binder therapy, both of which fit the TLS context of avoiding added calcium load [^1135V4Cb] [^115joFRj]. Although data on binders largely come from CKD and oncologic hyperphosphatemia settings, sevelamer and lanthanum are commonly used in cancer therapy–related hyperphosphatemia and may be helpful adjuncts here, while dietary phosphate restriction can be considered once the patient is stabilized and able to eat [^114DSFPL] [^116aq9S6] [^117Uz1kj].

> I will now examine when to escalate to renal replacement therapy, and I should confirm that there is no rigid lab threshold but that clinical context drives the decision. Early nephrology involvement is warranted if phosphate remains severe or is rising despite hydration and binders, especially when accompanied by AKI, oliguria, refractory hyperkalemia, symptomatic hypocalcemia, or fluid overload, and although some use a practical phosphate level near or above 7 mg/dL as a trigger with AKI, there is no consensus threshold, so I must individualize decisions to prevent or mitigate kidney injury and arrhythmias [^112shBGX] [^113JH3Bh]. Hemodialysis is preferred for efficient phosphate removal in TLS, while peritoneal dialysis should be avoided, and I should optimize dialytic phosphate removal and dialysate calcium within standard ranges to balance electrolyte risks during therapy [^112Y28Qn] [^112ayQyf] [^111UbymD]. Wait, I should verify that the RRT plan also addresses concurrent hyperkalemia and volume issues so we are not under-treating other dangerous components of TLS [^112shBGX].

> Let me think about parallel electrolyte management, because delaying these steps can be dangerous. For hyperkalemia, I should stabilize the cardiac membrane with intravenous calcium, shift potassium intracellularly with insulin and dextrose and consider beta-agonists, and eliminate potassium with loop diuretics if appropriate or dialysis if refractory, all while avoiding potassium-containing fluids and rechecking the ECG and electrolytes frequently [^1158EG2z] [^112qtpwj]. For hypocalcemia, I should not treat asymptomatic cases in TLS because administering calcium can precipitate calcium phosphate and worsen kidney injury, but if there are tetany, seizures, hypotension, or QT prolongation, I will give a short infusion of calcium gluconate with very close monitoring of calcium and phosphate, keeping calcium toward the low-normal range to limit precipitation risk [^112EmJ7F] [^112tkzNB] [^112LMBu6].

> I need to check uric acid control next, recognizing it does not directly lower phosphate but improves overall TLS control and kidney protection. Rasburicase is first-line in established TLS when not contraindicated, typically dosed at 0.2 mg/kg IV daily or a single fixed 6 mg dose with reassessment, achieving uric acid control within about 4 hours and continuing only as long as clinically needed based on serial uric acid levels and overall response, while avoiding combination with allopurinol because it can reduce rasburicase efficacy [^113B7pmp] [^114rSWDt] [^114XA8US] [^112uc6Sb]. Hold on, I should verify G6PD status before rasburicase to avoid hemolysis and methemoglobinemia and use alternative approaches if deficient, and I will repeat uric acid and creatinine alongside phosphorus and potassium to ensure coordinated improvement [^111LPALh] [^111d7xVS].

> Next, I should review the monitoring protocol to ensure we detect and treat deterioration early. During the acute phase, I will check potassium, phosphate, calcium, magnesium, uric acid, urea, and creatinine every 4–6 hours with continuous ECG monitoring when hyperkalemia or symptomatic hypocalcemia is present, documenting urine output closely and reassessing therapy based on trends, not single values [^113JH3Bh]. I should confirm pragmatic targets such as phosphate trending below approximately 5.5 mg/dL, falling uric acid below 7.5 mg/dL, and urine output above 100 mL per hour where feasible, recognizing these are operational and must be individualized to the patient's comorbidities and response trajectory [^112qtpwj] [^112LMBu6].

> But wait, I need to explicitly avoid harmful or outdated interventions that can worsen TLS kidney injury. I should not alkalinize the urine because it can promote calcium phosphate precipitation and paradoxically injure the kidney in TLS, I should avoid thiazide diuretics that can increase uric acid, I should not give calcium for asymptomatic hypocalcemia, and I must avoid all sodium phosphate–containing products that could acutely worsen hyperphosphatemia [^111z259W] [^117FPC4p] [^112LMBu6] [^116X9mE7] [^116AyZMa]. I need to ensure all care team members and order sets reflect these guardrails so we do not inadvertently cause harm during urgent care [^114JJV1A].

> Hmm, wait a minute, what if the phosphate value is spurious. In patients with paraproteinemias or marked hyperlipidemia, colorimetric interference can cause pseudohyperphosphatemia, so if the clinical picture does not match, I should repeat phosphate using alternative methods or deproteinized samples before escalating therapy with binders or dialysis to avoid unnecessary interventions [^111XyBX7]. I should confirm that the overall TLS pattern remains present regardless, because TLS rarely presents with isolated phosphate elevation without the broader biochemical constellation [^112qtpwj].

> I will now examine team structure and follow-up, because care fragmentation increases risk. Managing established TLS with hyperphosphatemia benefits from a multidisciplinary approach with hematology–oncology, nephrology, and critical care to coordinate hydration, binder therapy, dialysis, and chemotherapy timing, and once stabilized, I should plan secondary prophylaxis for subsequent treatment cycles given the risk of recurrence, potentially with hydration and rasburicase in high-risk settings while monitoring closely for rebound [^114JJV1A] [^114pUqH7]. Let me reconsider the risk category before each new cytoreductive step so preventive measures are matched to tumor burden, renal function, and prior TLS history [^111d7xVS].

> In summary, I should stabilize and confirm TLS, initiate aggressive isotonic hydration with close monitoring, start non–calcium-based phosphate binders early, control uric acid with rasburicase when appropriate, avoid treating asymptomatic hypocalcemia, and move swiftly to hemodialysis if phosphate and other life-threatening derangements persist, all within a multidisciplinary framework and with vigilant laboratory and ECG surveillance to prevent AKI and arrhythmias [^112qtpwj] [^112shBGX] [^112Y28Qn] [^113JH3Bh]. Hold on, I should verify after each intervention that trends are improving and that no contraindicated therapies slip into the regimen, adjusting the plan dynamically as the patient's electrolytes and renal function evolve [^112qtpwj].

---

TLS-associated hyperphosphatemia is managed with **aggressive IV hydration** [^111d7xVS] to maintain urine output ≥ 100 mL/hour [^112LMBu6]; **non-calcium phosphate binders** (sevelamer, lanthanum, aluminum hydroxide) when phosphate > 1.45 mmol/L; and **avoidance of calcium and vitamin D** to prevent calcium-phosphate precipitation. Treat symptomatic hypocalcemia only with **cautious IV calcium gluconate** [^112tkzNB], and initiate **urgent hemodialysis or CRRT** for phosphate > 2.1 mmol/L, symptomatic hypocalcemia, or AKI with oliguria/anuria. Monitor **electrolytes and renal function every 4–6 hours** [^113JH3Bh]. Avoid **peritoneal dialysis** and **urinary alkalinization** [^112Y28Qn] [^111z259W].

---

## Pathophysiology and clinical consequences

In TLS, **rapid tumor cell lysis releases intracellular phosphate**; the acute phosphate load then exceeds renal excretory capacity, causing hyperphosphatemia [^111d7xVS]. The resulting calcium-phosphate precipitation can cause nephrocalcinosis and acute kidney injury (AKI) [^112qtpwj] [^1137FViS]. Secondary hypocalcemia leads to neuromuscular irritability, tetany, seizures, and cardiac arrhythmias [^112qtpwj]; electrolyte imbalances, particularly hypocalcemia, further increase arrhythmic risk [^111d7xVS] [^114XZ4hg].

---

## Clinical thresholds for intervention

The Cairo-Bishop criteria define hyperphosphatemia in TLS as serum phosphate **≥ 1.45 mmol/L** (4.5 mg/dL) in adults or a 25% increase from baseline [^116i6XAs]. Intervention is typically initiated when phosphate exceeds 1.45 mmol/L, with **urgent intervention** required at > 2.1 mmol/L (6.5 mg/dL) or when symptomatic hypocalcemia occurs.

---

## Initial management strategies

### Aggressive intravenous hydration

- **Hydration**: Cornerstone of TLS management, promoting renal excretion of phosphate and preventing calcium-phosphate precipitation [^111d7xVS] [^112qtpwj].

- **Target urine output**: ≥ 100 mL/hour (approximately 2 mL/kg/hour) [^112LMBu6].

- **Fluid selection**: Isotonic fluids (normal saline or 5% dextrose in water) are preferred.

- **Diuretics**: Loop diuretics (e.g. furosemide) may be used cautiously if urine output is inadequate [^112LMBu6].

---

### Phosphate binders

Use of **phosphate binders** is essential to reduce intestinal phosphate absorption and lower serum phosphate levels [^112LMBu6]. Recommended binders include:

| **Phosphate binder** | **Dose** | **Comments** |
|-|-|-|
| Sevelamer | 800–1600 mg orally three times daily with meals | Preferred due to non-calcium, non-aluminum composition |
| Lanthanum carbonate | 500–1000 mg orally three times daily with meals | Effective alternative |
| Aluminum hydroxide | 300–600 mg orally three times daily with meals | Short-term use only due to aluminum toxicity risk |

---

Use of **calcium-based binders** is generally avoided due to risk of calcium-phosphate precipitation [^115joFRj].

---

### Dietary phosphate restriction

Dietary phosphate restriction focuses on limiting **phosphate intake** and **patient education** on avoiding high-phosphate foods (e.g. dairy products, nuts, processed foods) [^117Uz1kj].

---

## Management of hypocalcemia

- **Asymptomatic hypocalcemia**: Do not treat due to risk of calcium-phosphate precipitation [^112EmJ7F].

- **Symptomatic hypocalcemia**: Treat cautiously with intravenous calcium gluconate (10 mL of 10% solution diluted in 100 mL saline, infused over 10 minutes) [^112tkzNB].

- **Monitoring**: Closely monitor calcium, phosphate, and renal function during treatment [^112tkzNB].

---

## Indications for renal replacement therapy (RRT)

RRT is indicated in TLS-associated hyperphosphatemia under the following conditions:

- **Severe hyperphosphatemia**: Serum phosphate > 2.1 mmol/L (6.5 mg/dL) refractory to medical management.

- **Symptomatic hypocalcemia**: Persistent despite medical therapy.

- **Acute kidney injury**: Oliguria or anuria [^112qtpwj].

- **Fluid overload**: Intractable.

- **Life-threatening electrolyte abnormalities**: Refractory to medical management.

- **Preferred modality**: Intermittent hemodialysis or continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) [^112shBGX].

- **Peritoneal dialysis**: Not recommended due to inadequate phosphate clearance [^112Y28Qn].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

During the acute phase, **monitor serum phosphate, calcium, potassium, uric acid, creatinine, and LDH every 4–6 hours** [^113JH3Bh]. Additionally, closely follow neurological status and cardiac rhythm, and coordinate care through a multidisciplinary team involving hematologists, nephrologists, and intensivists [^114JJV1A].

---

## Potential complications of inadequate management

Inadequate management may cause **acute kidney injury** from calcium-phosphate precipitation [^111d7xVS], cardiac arrhythmias due to electrolyte imbalances, and hypocalcemia-related seizures with neuromuscular irritability. These complications increase morbidity and mortality.

---

## Summary of TLS-associated hyperphosphatemia management

| **Step** | **Intervention** | **Comments** |
|-|-|-|
| 1 | Aggressive IV hydration | Maintain urine output ≥ 100 mL/hour |
| 2 | Phosphate binders | Sevelamer, lanthanum, aluminum hydroxide |
| 3 | Dietary phosphate restriction | Educate patients on low-phosphate diet |
| 4 | Symptomatic hypocalcemia management | IV calcium gluconate cautiously |
| 5 | Renal replacement therapy | Hemodialysis or CRRT if indicated |
| 6 | Monitoring and follow-up | Frequent labs and clinical monitoring |

---

TLS-associated hyperphosphatemia requires **prompt, aggressive management** to prevent serious complications [^112qtpwj]. Key interventions include **aggressive hydration**, phosphate binders, dietary restriction, cautious management of hypocalcemia, and renal replacement therapy when indicated.

### Tumor lysis syndrome [^112qtpwj]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) is an acute, life-threatening disease affecting both adults and children, often associated with the initiation of cytoreductive therapy in the treatment of malignancy. A pattern of metabolic derangements occurs due to the massive release of intracellular contents into the systemic circulation. Characteristic findings include hyperuricemia, hyperphosphatemia, hyperkalemia, hypocalcemia, and uremia, all of which can lead to cardiac arrhythmia, seizures, renal failure, and sudden death. The incidence of TLS appears to be increasing because of a growing armamentarium of highly effective biologic and targeted therapies. Risk assessment and prevention are at the forefront of management, relying on clinician awareness, prophylactic measures, and vigilant laboratory monitoring.

Established TLS requires early, aggressive intervention with intravenous hydration, electrolyte management, and the use of hypouricemic agents. This review highlights the central role of diagnostic laboratory criteria for TLS and summarizes the clinical findings, pathophysiology, and evidence-based guidelines for the prevention and management of TLS.

### Pathophysiology, clinical consequences, and treatment of tumor lysis syndrome [^114XZ4hg]. The American Journal of Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Tumor lysis syndrome is an oncologic emergency characterized by severe electrolyte abnormalities and often by acute renal failure. The syndrome typically occurs in patients with lymphoproliferative malignancies, most often after the initiation of treatment. The pathophysiology involves massive tumor cell lysis, resulting in the release of large amounts of potassium, phosphate, and uric acid.

Deposition of uric acid and calcium phosphate crystals in the renal tubules can lead to acute renal failure, often exacerbated by concomitant intravascular volume depletion. The kidney normally excretes these products; consequently, preexisting renal failure exacerbates the metabolic derangements of tumor lysis syndrome.

Standard treatment aims to clear high plasma levels of potassium, uric acid, and phosphorus; correct acidosis; and prevent acute renal failure. This is achieved through aggressive intravenous hydration, lowering serum potassium levels, the use of allopurinol, urinary alkalinization, or renal replacement therapy if necessary. Allopurinol is the standard of care for treating hyperuricemia of malignancy, but is associated with drawbacks. Recombinant urate oxidase (rasburicase), which recently became available in the United States, provides a safe and effective alternative to allopurinol for lowering uric acid levels and preventing uric acid nephropathy.

### Tumor lysis syndrome [^114SAimQ]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2025). Low credibility.

Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) is an oncologic emergency that occurs due to the massive lysis of tumor cells, resulting in hyperkalemia, hyperuricemia, hyperphosphatemia, and hypocalcemia. Patients are at significant risk for acute kidney injury, arrhythmia, seizures, and sudden death as sequelae of this condition. Management is dependent on severity but often includes acute stabilization, aggressive hydration, correction of electrolyte abnormalities, and uric acid-lowering medications such as rasburicase and allopurinol. TLS carries a high morbidity and mortality risk, making prevention through intravenous hydration and prophylactic medications the best management strategy.

### Futibatinib, an irreversible FGFR1–4 inhibitor for the treatment of FGFR-aberrant tumors [^116aq9S6]. The Oncologist (2023). Low credibility.

The most common adverse event (AE) across studies was hyperphosphatemia, similar to findings with pemigatinib and infigratinib. Hyperphosphatemia is an on-target effect of FGFR inhibition because decreased FGF23–FGFR1 signaling leads to increased phosphate reabsorption and hyperphosphatemia in proximal tubules. The numerically higher rates of hyperphosphatemia reported with futibatinib versus pemigatinib and infigratinib may be related to differences in dosing schedules, safety assessments, and grade definitions between studies.

Hyperphosphatemia was not defined in the National Cancer Institute Common Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.03, the version used for safety assessments in these trials. In the futibatinib studies, hyperphosphatemia was graded by serum phosphate levels regardless of symptoms, which was not the case for the pemigatinib trial. In the two futibatinib studies, hyperphosphatemia was managed with phosphate binders (75%-78%), dose interruptions (17%-20%), or dose reductions (8%-20%). All grade 3–4 events of hyperphosphatemia resolved, except in two patients in the phase I expansion study, where resolution could not be assessed as they discontinued the study due to disease progression and withdrawal of consent.

### Control of plasma uric acid in adults at risk for tumor lysis syndrome: efficacy and safety of rasburicase alone and rasburicase followed by allopurinol compared with allopurinol alone — results of a multicenter phase III study [^114rSWDt]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2010). High credibility.

Rasburicase is effective in controlling plasma uric acid in pediatric patients with hematologic malignancies. This study in adults evaluated the safety and compared the efficacy of rasburicase alone with rasburicase followed by oral allopurinol, and with allopurinol alone, in controlling plasma uric acid.

- **Patients and methods**: Adults with hematologic malignancies at risk for hyperuricemia and tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) were randomly assigned to receive rasburicase (0.20 mg/kg/day intravenously on days 1–5), rasburicase plus allopurinol (rasburicase 0.20 mg/kg/day on days 1 to 3 followed by oral allopurinol 300 mg/day on days 3 to 5), or allopurinol (300 mg/day orally on days 1 to 5). The primary efficacy variable was the plasma uric acid response rate, defined as the percentage of patients achieving or maintaining plasma uric acid ≤ 7.5 mg/dL during days 3 to 7.

- **Results**: Ninety-two patients received rasburicase, 92 received rasburicase plus allopurinol, and 91 received allopurinol. The plasma uric acid response rate was 87% with rasburicase, 78% with rasburicase plus allopurinol, and 66% with allopurinol. It was significantly greater for rasburicase than for allopurinol (P = .001) in the overall study population, in patients at high risk for TLS (89% vs. 68%; p = 0.012), and in those with baseline hyperuricemia (90% vs. 53%; p = 0.015). Time to plasma uric acid control in hyperuricemic patients was 4 hours for rasburicase, 4 hours for rasburicase plus allopurinol, and 27 hours for allopurinol.

- **Conclusion**: In adults with hyperuricemia or at high risk for TLS, rasburicase provided control of plasma uric acid more rapidly than allopurinol.

### A tumour lysis syndrome in a chemotherapy naïve patient with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma [^1115BUyr]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Low credibility.

A 56-year-old woman with a new diagnosis of metastatic pancreatic cancer presents to the emergency room with generalized fatigue. The patient is afebrile; however, she is hypotensive and tachycardic. Physical examination reveals diffuse lymphadenopathy.

Initial laboratory tests indicate that the patient has hyperkalemia, hypocalcemia, high lactate dehydrogenase, and high uric acid. The patient was also in renal failure. Based on the clinical presentation, she was diagnosed with spontaneous tumour lysis syndrome, despite the syndrome never having been reported in metastatic pancreatic cancer.

The patient was treated appropriately with intravenous hydration, allopurinol, and rasburicase. All laboratory abnormalities were corrected by day 3 of treatment.

### Hyperuricemia and acute kidney injury secondary to spontaneous tumor lysis syndrome in low risk myelodysplastic syndrome [^115xaJtm]. BMC Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

The most commonly used diagnostic laboratory and clinical criteria for tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) are those proposed by Cairo and Bishop. A clinical diagnosis of TLS includes one clinical symptom and two laboratory criteria; at least two laboratory criteria must be present for three days before treatment or up to seven days after treatment. In our case, the patient fulfilled one clinical symptom (acute renal failure) and two laboratory criteria (hyperphosphatemia, hyperuricemia), thus meeting the clinical diagnostic criteria for TLS. In the absence of precipitating chemotherapy or radiotherapy, we considered this as a spontaneous TLS (STLS) case.

Acute TLS is usually observed after the initiation of cytotoxic chemotherapy for malignancies, especially hematological malignancies with a high turnover rate. The severity of TLS depends on tumor burden, tumor type, proliferation rate, baseline uric acid level, and the sensitivity of the tumor to chemotherapeutic agents. STLS prior to the initiation of chemotherapy is rare, especially in the absence of evidence of a tumor, including hematological malignancies and solid tumors. According to previous studies, STLS most commonly occurs in Burkitt lymphoma and non-T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, but it has also been reported in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), myelofibrosis, metastatic germ cell tumor, and solid tumors.

### Emergencies in haematology: Tumour lysis syndrome [^111s8aMm]. British Journal of Haematology (2020). Low credibility.

Tumour lysis syndrome (TLS) is a significant complication of haematologic malignancies and their management. The syndrome consists of laboratory abnormalities either alone (laboratory TLS) or with clinical sequelae, including renal failure, seizures, and arrhythmias (clinical TLS). Clinical TLS is a predictor of worse overall morbidity and mortality in cancer patients but can be prevented. Accurate prognostication is therefore critical to the appropriate management of patients at risk for TLS, incorporating both disease factors (tumour type and burden) and patient factors (baseline renal insufficiency or hyperuricaemia). Strategies to prevent TLS include hydration and allopurinol in low- and intermediate-risk patients, and rasburicase in high-risk patients.

### Comparison of fixed versus traditional weight-based dosing of rasburicase in a pediatric population [^116R7BNs]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2018). Low credibility.

The American Society of Clinical Oncology guidelines recommend rasburicase for the treatment of pediatric patients with hyperuricemia at risk of tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) using a weight-based dose of 0.1–0.2 mg/kg once daily for 1–7 days. However, there has been a trend in practice due to recent data showing benefit using a fixed-dose approach. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety between fixed and weight-based dosing of rasburicase in a pediatric population.

- **Procedure**: This was a retrospective chart review of 48 patients from January 1, 2007, to August 31, 2016, at Children's National Health System. Patients less than 18 years old with a documented diagnosis of a malignancy and baseline uric acid level were included; patients less than 30 kg at the time of rasburicase administration were excluded.

- **Results**: The primary endpoint of this study was the treatment success of normalization of uric acid level (< 5 mg/dl) within 24 hours of rasburicase administration. Eighty-three percent of patients had success with normalization of uric acid post rasburicase dose. Eighty-five percent of patients had success in the weight-based group compared to eighty-one percent in the fixed-dose group (P = 0.715). The mean percent reduction of uric acid at 24 hours was relatively similar between both groups (94% vs. 89%).

- **Conclusion**: Our results suggest that a fixed-dose strategy of rasburicase is both safe and effective in reducing uric acid levels in the pediatric patient population. A fixed dose of rasburicase 6 mg is a cost-effective treatment option for TLS.

### Management of tumour lysis syndrome during first-line palliative chemotherapy for high-volume colorectal cancer [^114pUqH7]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Tumour lysis syndrome (TLS) is a rare oncological emergency in solid tumours and is associated with a poor short-term prognosis. Therefore, early recognition and treatment are essential. This case involves a middle-aged woman who presented with stage IV colon cancer with massive hepatic involvement. After three cycles of first-line FOLFOX (folinic acid, 5-fluorouracil, and oxaliplatin), she developed acute kidney injury and hyperkalaemia that did not respond to standard measures.

A high suspicion of TLS led to further corroborative investigations and early admission to an intensive care unit. With vigorous hydration and allopurinol, TLS resolved completely, and the patient was discharged. Prophylaxis of subsequent TLS recurrences was complicated by biopsy-proven neutrophilic vasculitis secondary to allopurinol. Prevention of TLS in future cycles involved hydration and rasburicase before each chemotherapy session. This case report aims to highlight the risk factors for TLS in solid tumours and focuses on treatment and secondary prophylaxis of TLS.

### Tumour lysis syndrome: new therapeutic strategies and classification [^111U2Ebv]. British Journal of Haematology (2004). Low credibility.

Tumour lysis syndrome (TLS) describes the metabolic derangements that occur with tumour breakdown following the initiation of cytotoxic therapy. TLS results from the rapid destruction of malignant cells and the abrupt release of intracellular ions, nucleic acids, proteins, and their metabolites into the extracellular space. These metabolites can overwhelm the body's normal homeostatic mechanisms and cause hyperuricaemia, hyperkalaemia, hyperphosphataemia, hypocalcaemia, and uraemia. TLS can lead to acute renal failure and can be life-threatening. Early recognition of patients at risk and initiation of therapy for TLS is essential.

There is a high incidence of TLS in tumours with high proliferative rates and tumour burden, such as acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and Burkitt's lymphoma. The mainstays of TLS prophylaxis and treatment include aggressive hydration and diuresis, control of hyperuricaemia with allopurinol prophylaxis and rasburicase treatment, and vigilant monitoring of electrolyte abnormalities. **Urine alkalinization** remains controversial. Unfortunately, there have been few comprehensive reviews on this important subject. In this review, we describe the incidence, pathophysiological mechanisms of TLS, and risk factors for its development. We summarise recent advances in the management of TLS and provide a new classification system and recommendations for prophylaxis and/or treatment based on this classification scheme.

### What have we learnt about the regulation of phosphate metabolism [^113rXV6U]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2004). Low credibility.

The search for hormones that specifically regulate phosphate metabolism has fueled recent intriguing studies. These studies have been motivated by diseases involving renal phosphate wasting, including tumor-induced osteomalacia, X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets, and autosomal dominant hypophosphatemia. This review focuses on likely candidate 'phosphatonins' and their possible physiological significance.

- **Recent findings**: Candidate phosphatonins include fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23), matrix extracellular phosphoglycoprotein, stanniocalcin, and Frizzled-related protein 4. FGF-23 has emerged as the prime candidate explaining the pathophysiology of these diseases. FGF-23 is expressed in most tumors in tumor-induced osteomalacia. Serum FGF-23 is increased in most patients with X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets and tumor-induced osteomalacia. Injection of recombinant FGF-23 induces phosphaturia, hypophosphatemia, and suppression of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D in animals.

Many unanswered questions remain, including the relationship between PHEX (phosphate-regulating gene with homologies to endopeptidases on the X chromosome) mutations and elevated FGF-23. It is also not clear whether these candidate phosphatonins play a role in phosphate or vitamin D metabolism in healthy humans, or if this role is endocrine. The most compelling evidence derives from the FGF-23-knockout mouse, which shows hyperphosphatemia and increased serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D.

### A physiologic-based approach to the treatment of acute hyperkalemia [^1158EG2z]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Hyperkalemia is a common and potentially lethal disorder. Given its variable presentation, clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion, particularly in patients with chronic kidney disease. This case highlights key physiological mechanisms involved in the development of hyperkalemia and provides an outline for emergent treatment. In this context, we discuss specific mechanisms of action for the available treatments of hyperkalemia.

### A 90-year-old man with hyperphosphatemia [^111XyBX7]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Hyperphosphatemia is a common condition in patients with decreased kidney function, and without treatment, it can lead to a variety of clinical consequences. However, the presence of hyperphosphatemia in patients with normal kidney function may be true or spurious. We present a case of pseudohyperphosphatemia in a patient with monoclonal gammopathy. An increased paraprotein level can lead to colorimetric interference of the assay of phosphate measurement and result in spurious hyperphosphatemia. The epidemiologic and clinical characteristics of paraprotein-associated pseudohyperphosphatemia are also reviewed here. Ultrafiltration of paraproteins or deproteinization can help correct the measuring error. Patients with spurious hyperphosphatemia should not be treated with phosphate binders. Clinicians treating patients with monoclonal gammopathy should be aware of this relatively common clinical phenomenon and avoid inappropriate treatment of spurious hyperphosphatemia.

### Venclexta [^111Vfvmt]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Tumor lysis syndrome**: Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS), including fatal events and renal failure requiring dialysis, has occurred in patients treated with Venclexta [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Venclexta can cause rapid reduction in tumor size, which poses a risk for TLS at initiation, during the ramp-up phase in all patients, and during reinitiation after dosage interruption in patients with CLL/SLL. Changes in blood chemistries consistent with TLS that require prompt management can occur as early as 6 to 8 hours following the first dose of Venclexta and at each dose increase. TLS, including fatal cases, has been reported following a single 20 mg dose of Venclexta.

In patients with CLL/SLL who followed the current 5-week dose ramp-up and the TLS prophylaxis and monitoring measures, the rate of TLS was 2% in the Venclexta CLL/SLL monotherapy trials. The rate of TLS remained consistent when Venclexta was combined with obinutuzumab or rituximab. With a 2- to 3-week dose ramp-up and a higher starting dose in patients with CLL/SLL, the TLS rate was 13% and included cases of death and renal failure [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

### Hyperuricemia and acute kidney injury secondary to spontaneous tumor lysis syndrome in low risk myelodysplastic syndrome [^113if6Fa]. BMC Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

Acute tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) is a metabolic disorder manifesting as the abrupt occurrence of acute kidney injury (AKI), metabolic acidosis, and electrolyte disturbances. These disturbances include hyperuricemia, hyperphosphatemia, hyperkalemia, and hypocalcemia. TLS most commonly results from the treatment of malignancies, especially those with a high turnover rate, such as hematologic malignancies. Spontaneous tumor lysis syndrome (STLS) before chemotherapy is a rare event that has been mostly reported in Burkitt lymphoma and non T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Here, we report a rare case of STLS in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) which presented with marked hyperuricemia and AKI months before the diagnosis of MDS.

### Tumor lysis syndrome: Risk factors, diagnosis, and management [^112UsQjy]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2014). Low credibility.

Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) is a potentially fatal complication of induction therapy for several types of malignancies. Electrolyte derangements and even downstream complications may occur prior to the initial presentation to a medical provider, before an oncologic diagnosis has been established. It is, therefore, imperative that emergency physicians be familiar with the risk factors for TLS in children, as well as the criteria for diagnosis and the strategies for prevention and management. Careful evaluation of serum electrolytes, uric acid, and renal function must occur. Patients at risk for TLS and those who already exhibit laboratory or clinical evidence of TLS require close monitoring, aggressive hydration, and appropriate medical treatment.

### Treatment-naïve spontaneous tumor lysis syndrome in metastatic prostate adenocarcinoma: An unusual suspect [^1112SxnE]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) is a potentially fatal condition defined both by laboratory and clinical criteria. It is caused by the catabolism of tumor cells which leads to considerable release and elevated levels of phosphate, potassium, and uric acid in the bloodstream. These electrolyte derangements predispose patients to renal tubule uric acid precipitation, acute kidney injury (AKI), arrhythmias, neuromuscular irritability, and even seizures. Although this phenomenon is well described with hematological malignancies, it is also known to occur among solid tumors.

We present a rare case of treatment-naïve spontaneous TLS that occurred in a 69-year-old male with metastatic prostate adenocarcinoma with hyperkalemia, hyperuricemia, hyperphosphatemia, hypocalcemia, elevated liver enzymes, AKI, and hemodynamic instability. Despite our best resuscitative efforts with intravenous hydration, electrolyte monitoring, Rasburicase, and renal replacement therapy, the patient continued to decline, was made comfort care, and expired shortly thereafter.

Physicians encountering patients with the above presentation must entertain a diagnosis of TLS despite its rarity in solid tumors, as early diagnosis leads to timely treatment, thereby maximizing patients' chances at survival.

### Management of hematological patients requiring emergency chemotherapy in the intensive care unit [^113JH3Bh]. Intensive Care Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

Due to the risk of uratic nephropathy, the treatment includes hypouricemic therapy, favoring rasburicase over allopurinol starting from the biological TLS stage. However, ruling out glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is essential beforehand to prevent rasburicase-induced methemoglobinemia.

Renal replacement therapy (RRT) should be discussed early, in addition to the usual criteria, in the event of persistent hyperphosphatemia, although no threshold could be determined by consensus. In this context, the early consideration of hyperphosphatemia is part of an approach to prevent the onset or worsening of acute kidney injury (AKI). Clinical, ECG, and biological monitoring is essential before and during the initiation of anti-tumor treatment (cytoreduction or chemotherapy). The main biological abnormalities (serum potassium, phosphoremia, calcemia, uremia, creatinine, uric acid level, and eventually LDH) must be checked every 4–6 hours during the acute phase.

### Choosing between family members is always a balancing act [^1117D4dW]. Haematologica (2023). Low credibility.

Significant tumor lysis syndrome is now an uncommon occurrence in clinical trials, and there is not a clear difference in incidence between patients treated with VenO or VenR. The three laboratory tumor lysis syndrome events (1.5%) observed in CLL14 occurred following obinutuzumab prior to exposure to venetoclax. Six grade ≥ 3 tumor lysis syndrome events (3.1%) were observed in MURANO following VenR, one of which was fatal during venetoclax ramp-up. In GAIA/CLL13, venetoclax ramp-up commenced on day 22 of cycle 1 for both VenO and VenR, with similar grade ≥ 3 tumor lysis syndrome incidences observed by Cairo-Bishop criteria (VenO 8.8% vs. VenR 10.1%). The majority of tumor lysis syndrome events with VenO occurred prior to venetoclax ramp-up, while for VenR, most occurred after initiation of venetoclax ramp-up. With this dosing schedule, one patient (1.3%) experienced tumor lysis syndrome using the more stringent Howard criteria in VERITAS.

Collectively, these data suggest a trend toward greater adverse events experienced with VenO compared with VenR, without clearly increased treatment-related deaths or tumor lysis syndrome. Because of its more favorable safety profile, VenR may be better suited as first therapy in frail, unfit patients and those with significant infection risk factors, including risk factors for COVID-19.

Obinutuzumab is more efficacious than rituximab in combination with venetoclax as frontline therapy for CLL, independently of patients' fitness, at the cost of increased adverse events. Although both combinations (VenO and VenR) are active against TP53-disrupted cases, the choice between them must consider the balance between efficacy and adverse event risk.

### Tumor lysis syndrome and AKI: Beyond crystal mechanisms [^1137FViS]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2022). High credibility.

The pathophysiology of AKI during tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) is not well understood due to the paucity of data. We aimed to decipher crystal-dependent and crystal-independent mechanisms of TLS-induced AKI.

- **Methods**: Crystalluria, plasma cytokine levels, and extracellular histones levels were measured in two cohorts of patients with TLS. We developed a model of TLS in syngeneic mice with acute myeloid leukemia and analyzed ultrastructural changes in kidneys and endothelial permeability using intravital confocal microscopy. In parallel, we studied the endothelial toxicity of extracellular histones in vitro.

- **Results**: The study provides the first evidence that previously described crystal-dependent mechanisms are insufficient to explain TLS-induced AKI. Extracellular histones that are released in huge amounts during TLS caused profound endothelial alterations in the mouse model. The mechanisms of histone-mediated damage implicate endothelial cell activation mediated by Toll-like receptor 4. Heparin inhibits extracellular histones and mitigates endothelial dysfunction during TLS.

- **Conclusion**: This study sheds new light on the pathophysiology of TLS-induced AKI and suggests that extracellular histones may constitute a novel target for therapeutic intervention in TLS when endothelial dysfunction occurs.

### Tenapanor: An update on evidence of effectiveness and guidance on practical use [^113gRbsZ]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2025). Low credibility.

Hyperphosphatemia remains a major challenge in managing patients with kidney failure and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Traditional approaches, such as dietary phosphate restriction, oral phosphate binders, and dialysis modifications, even if combined, often provide insufficient control of serum phosphate levels. Tenapanor, a novel therapy that targets intestinal phosphate absorption, has shown promise in reducing serum phosphate both as monotherapy and in combination with binders, though gastrointestinal side effects may occur. Herein, we review the available information about the clinical use of tenapanor, including its safety profile, and we provide some clinical suggestions for its practical use.

### Safety profile and adverse event management for futibatinib, an irreversible FGFR1–4 Inhibitor: Pooled safety analysis of 469 patients [^114DSFPL]. Clinical Cancer Research (2024). Low credibility.

Hyperphosphatemia was the most common adverse event of clinical interest (AECI), reported in 385 (82.1%) patients in the overall population and in 280 (88.1%) patients in the 20-mg every day population. In total, 88 (18.8%) patients experienced grade 3 hyperphosphatemia (serum phosphate > 7 to ≤ 10 mg/dL, regardless of clinical symptoms), including 75 (23.6%) patients in the 20-mg every day population. All events were considered treatment-related. No grade 4 events occurred. In the overall population, the median time to onset for any-grade and grade ≥ 3 hyperphosphatemia was 6 and 9 days, respectively, with a median time to resolution to grade ≤ 2 of 7 days. All but five cases of grade 3 hyperphosphatemia resolved to grade < 1, with a median time to resolution to grade < 1 of 8 days in both the overall and 20-mg every day populations.

Management of hyperphosphatemia included the use of phosphate-lowering agents, such as phosphate binders and phosphaturic agents, and futibatinib dose modifications according to study protocols. Patients were also educated on dietary modifications to minimize intake of foods with high phosphorus content. In the 20-mg every day population, 248 (78.0%) patients received at least one concomitant supportive medication for the management of hyperphosphatemia. Supportive medications (used either alone or in combination) included sevelamer (n = 225, 70.7%), acetazolamide (n = 84, 26.4%), and lanthanum carbonate (n = 39, 12.3%). Additionally, management of hyperphosphatemia involved futibatinib dose interruptions.

### Renal calculi: An unusual presentation of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia [^115kv343]. Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Spontaneous tumor lysis syndrome is a rare initial presentation of hematologic malignancy in children that typically presents with complications of electrolyte derangement, specifically hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, and hyperuricemia. We report a case of a 5-year-old boy who presented to the emergency department with gross hematuria, abdominal pain, and vomiting and was ultimately diagnosed with uric acid nephrolithiasis and acute renal failure secondary to spontaneous tumor lysis syndrome in the setting of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Tumor lysis syndrome is considered an oncologic emergency, and in this case, the child required urgent treatment with potassium-binding agents, rasburicase, and hemodialysis. This case demonstrates that occult hematologic malignancy should be suspected in cases of nephrolithiasis and acute renal failure when found in conjunction with hyperuricemia despite a normal complete blood count at the time of presentation.

### Recommendations for the evaluation of risk and prophylaxis of tumour lysis syndrome (TLS) in adults and children with malignant diseases: an expert TLS panel consensus [^117QDkbR]. British Journal of Haematology (2010). Low credibility.

Tumour lysis syndrome (TLS) is a life-threatening oncological emergency characterized by metabolic abnormalities, including hyperuricaemia, hyperphosphataemia, hyperkalaemia, and hypocalcaemia. These metabolic complications predispose cancer patients to clinical toxicities, including renal insufficiency, cardiac arrhythmias, seizures, neurological complications, and potentially sudden death. With the increased availability of newer therapeutic targeted agents, such as rasburicase (recombinant urate oxidase), there are no published guidelines on the risk classification of TLS for individual patients at risk of developing this syndrome.

We convened an international TLS expert consensus panel to develop guidelines for a medical decision tree to assign low, intermediate, and high risk to patients with cancer at risk for TLS. Risk factors included biological evidence of laboratory TLS (LTLS), proliferation, bulk and stage of the malignant tumor, and renal impairment and/or involvement at the time of TLS diagnosis. An international TLS consensus expert panel of pediatric and adult oncologists, experts in TLS pathophysiology and experts in TLS prophylaxis and management, developed a final model of low, intermediate, and high risk TLS classification with associated TLS prophylaxis recommendations.

### An expert perspective on phosphate dysregulation with a focus on chronic hypophosphatemia [^114m1xe5]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). High credibility.

Hyperphosphatemia is defined in adults as a serum phosphate level greater than 1.45 mmol/L (4.5 mg/dL) and often occurs in patients with acute or chronic kidney disease (CKD), hypophosphatasia, or vitamin D intoxication. Rare genetic disorders associated with hyperphosphatemia include familial tumoral calcinosis, which is linked to reduced intact FGF23 levels, and hypoparathyroidism, which is associated with reduced PTH production. Elevated phosphate levels, even within the normal range, are linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease in the general population and can lead to overt hyperphosphatemia, particularly in patients with CKD. Prolonged hyperphosphatemia can result in serious complications such as vascular calcification and heart failure.

### Onco-nephrology: Tumor lysis syndrome [^115JZEPv]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) describes the clinical and laboratory sequelae that result from the rapid release of intracellular contents of dying cancer cells. It is characterized by the release of potassium, phosphorous, and nucleic acids from cancer cells into the bloodstream, with the potential to cause hyperkalemia; hyperphosphatemia and secondary hypocalcemia; hyperuricemia; acute kidney injury (AKI); and, should usual homeostatic mechanisms fail, death. TLS most commonly follows treatment of hematologic malignancies, such as acute lymphocytic or lymphoblastic leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia, and Burkitt lymphoma, but also occurs after treatment of other bulky or rapidly growing tumors, particularly if the patient is highly sensitive to the effects of cytotoxic chemotherapy. Prevention and treatment depend on prompt recognition of patients at risk, volume repletion, allopurinol, rasburicase (a novel recombinant urate oxidase), and, when indicated, dialysis.

### Management of hematological patients requiring emergency chemotherapy in the intensive care unit [^114WKcHn]. Intensive Care Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

Tumor lysis syndrome

TLS is a life-threatening condition resulting from the release of tumor cell contents into the bloodstream, including deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and its metabolites, intracellular ions (potassium, phosphorus), as well as proteins like lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and certain cytokines. The degradation of the purine bases of DNA (adenine, guanine) leads to an increase in plasmatic uric acid and the formation of uric acid crystals. Released phosphorus precipitates with calcium, leading to hypocalcemia and the formation of calcium phosphate crystals. TLS-associated laboratory abnormalities include hyperuricemia, hyperphosphatemia, hypocalcemia, and hyperkalemia, collectively defining biological TLS according to Cairo and Bishop (see supplementary Table 1).

Clinical TLS is defined by the combination of biological TLS with acute kidney injury (AKI), seizures (related to hypocalcemia), ventricular arrhythmia, or sudden cardiac death (related to hyperkalemia).

TLS occurs in patients with chemosensitive malignancy and high tumor burden. It is common in hyperleukocytic leukemia or high-grade non-Hodgkin lymphomas, such as Burkitt's lymphoma. Although TLS mainly affects patients undergoing chemotherapy, spontaneous TLS might also occur. It is estimated that up to 40% of TLS cases happen spontaneously in high-risk patients. Paradoxically, as a marker of high tumor burden, spontaneous TLS indicates the need for urgent chemotherapy and close monitoring.

AKI severely affects the prognosis of TLS and is associated with a 66% mortality rate.

- **Tumor lysis syndrome**: Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS), which may be life-threatening or fatal, has been observed in patients receiving Blincyto [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Appropriate prophylactic measures, including pretreatment nontoxic cytoreduction and on-treatment hydration, should be used for the prevention of TLS during Blincyto treatment. Monitor for signs or symptoms of TLS. Management of these events may require either temporary interruption or discontinuation of Blincyto [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

- **Neutropenia and febrile neutropenia**: Neutropenia and febrile neutropenia, including life-threatening cases, have been observed in patients receiving Blincyto [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Monitor laboratory parameters (including, but not limited to, white blood cell count and absolute neutrophil count) during Blincyto infusion. Interrupt Blincyto if prolonged neutropenia occurs.

- **Effects on ability to drive and use machines**: Due to the potential for neurologic events, including seizures and ICANS, patients receiving Blincyto are at risk for loss of consciousness [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Advise patients to refrain from driving and engaging in hazardous occupations or activities such as operating heavy or potentially dangerous machinery while Blincyto is being administered.

### Tumour lysis syndrome [^111d7xVS]. Nature Reviews Disease Primers (2024). High credibility.

Tumour lysis syndrome (TLS) represents a critical oncological emergency characterized by extensive tumour cell breakdown, leading to the swift release of intracellular contents into the systemic circulation, which outpaces homeostatic mechanisms. This process results in hyperuricaemia (a by-product of intracellular DNA release), hyperkalaemia, hyperphosphataemia, hypocalcaemia, and the accumulation of xanthine. These electrolyte and metabolic imbalances pose a significant risk of acute kidney injury, cardiac arrhythmias, seizures, multiorgan failure, and, rarely, death.

While TLS can occur spontaneously, it usually arises shortly after the initiation of effective treatment, particularly in patients with a large cancer cell mass (defined as ≥ 500 g or ≥ 300 g/m² of body surface area in children). To prevent TLS, close monitoring and hydration are essential to improve renal perfusion and urine output, minimizing uric acid or calcium phosphate precipitation in renal tubules. Intervention is based on the patient's risk of developing TLS and can include the administration of rasburicase and allopurinol.

Xanthine, typically enzymatically converted to uric acid, can accumulate when xanthine oxidases, such as allopurinol, are administered during TLS management. Whether the measurement of xanthine is clinically useful to optimize the use of allopurinol or rasburicase remains to be determined.

### Hyperuricemia and acute kidney injury secondary to spontaneous tumor lysis syndrome in low risk myelodysplastic syndrome [^114LZucb]. BMC Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

This is a rare instance of acute kidney injury caused by hyperuricemia due to spontaneous tumor lysis syndrome, and it is the first case reported in association with myelodysplastic syndrome. A 53-year-old man presented with abrupt oliguria. Laboratory findings on admission included hyperuricemia, hyperphosphatemia, hypocalcemia, metabolic acidosis, and rapidly rising serum creatinine, which were consistent with acute tumor lysis syndrome in the absence of precipitating chemotherapy or radiotherapy. After hemodialysis and oral uric acid-lowering therapy, serum uric acid levels returned to normal range and renal function rapidly recovered. The patient was diagnosed with myelodysplastic syndrome eleven months later.

Occult malignancy, including solid tumors and hematological malignancies, should be carefully evaluated in cases of unexplainable acute kidney injury with hyperuricemia. Aggressive investigations should be thoroughly considered and repeated in this population.

### The clinical management of tumour lysis syndrome in haematological malignancies [^113n9nEw]. British Journal of Haematology (2011). Low credibility.

Tumour lysis syndrome (TLS) is caused by the disintegration of malignant cells, usually following the initiation of chemotherapy, although it may already be present at the time of initial presentation in a minority of cases. As a direct result of malignant cell breakdown, intracellular ions, proteins, nucleic acids, and their metabolites are released into the plasma, causing the characteristic metabolic abnormalities of TLS: hyperuricaemia, hyperkalaemia, hyperphosphataemia, and hypocalcaemia. In many cases, the release of large amounts of intracellular contents is so abrupt that normal homeostatic mechanisms are rapidly overwhelmed. Without prompt and effective management, the clinical effects of TLS soon become apparent.

### Venclexta [^1113maxb]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide).

- **Tumor lysis syndrome**: Advise patients of the potential risk of TLS, particularly at treatment initiation, during the ramp-up phase, and with resumption after an interruption. They should immediately report any signs and symptoms associated with this event (fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, confusion, shortness of breath, seizure, irregular heartbeat, dark or cloudy urine, unusual tiredness, muscle pain, and/or joint discomfort) to their health care provider (HCP) for evaluation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Advise patients to be adequately hydrated every day when taking Venclexta to reduce the risk of TLS. The recommended volume is 6 to 8 glasses (approximately 56 ounces total) of water each day. Patients should drink water starting 2 days before and on the day of the first dose, and every time the dose is increased [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

Advise patients of the importance of keeping scheduled appointments for blood work or other laboratory tests [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

Advise patients that it may be necessary to take Venclexta in the hospital or medical office setting to allow monitoring for TLS.

### Hypophosphatemia: an update on its etiology and treatment [^111yLznz]. The American Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Phosphate plays a key role in several biological processes. In recent years, new insights have been obtained into the regulation of phosphate metabolism, with growing evidence suggesting that factors other than parathyroid hormone (PTH) and vitamin D are involved in maintaining phosphate balance. A new class of phosphate-regulating factors, the so-called "phosphatonins", have been shown to be important in phosphate-wasting diseases; however, the role of phosphatonins in normal human homeostasis remains to be established.

The incidence of hypophosphatemia in selected patient series can be more than 20%, with clinical sequelae ranging from mild to life-threatening. Only when combined with phosphate depletion does hypophosphatemia become clinically significant. Factors involved in phosphate homeostasis, the pathophysiology, relevance in patient care, clinical manifestations, and appropriate management of phosphate depletion are discussed in this review.

### Tumor lysis syndrome in chronic lymphocytic leukemia with novel targeted agents [^117FPC4p]. The Oncologist (2017). Low credibility.

The NCCN recommends rasburicase for patients with any high-risk feature (e.g. bulky disease requiring immediate therapy) in whom adequate hydration is not possible or allopurinol is ineffective, or in patients with acute renal failure. Although the schedule of rasburicase was initially recommended as 0.2 mg/kg daily for up to 5 days, subsequent data support a single dose of 0.15–0.2 mg/kg, with a second dose the next day if the uric acid level is not back to within normal range. A single fixed dose of 6 mg rasburicase administered intravenously is also common for lowering uric acid in the management of TLS. Although rasburicase is effective in correcting hyperuricemia, there are no randomized controlled trials showing that it prevents renal failure or death. Patients who are considered candidates for rasburicase, especially those of African or Mediterranean descent, should first be tested for glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency because those with a deficiency of the enzyme are at risk for hemolysis and methemoglobinemia.

Alkalinization of the urine is no longer recommended as a management strategy because it may be associated with metabolic acidosis and calcium phosphate precipitation. To avoid the risk of nephropathy due to calcium phosphate deposition, treatment of asymptomatic hypocalcemia is generally not recommended. Dialysis should be considered for patients with acute kidney injury who have life-threatening electrolyte disturbances.

### Practical management of tumour lysis syndrome in venetoclax-treated patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia [^112Pd4Tb]. British Journal of Haematology (2020). Low credibility.

Optimizing venetoclax treatment in routine clinical practice involves several crucial steps. Initially, patient-doctor discussions determine the treatment choice. When discussing treatment options and deciding on the optimal treatment, several factors are important:

- **Informed consent**: Ensuring patients are fully informed and consent to the treatment.

- **Rationale for selecting venetoclax**: Discussing why venetoclax is the preferred option.

- **Continuous vs. fixed duration strategy**: Considering whether to pursue a continuous treatment strategy or a fixed duration strategy [Venetoclax SmPC, 2018].

- **Potential side effects**: Explaining possible adverse effects of the medication.

- **Safety aspects**: Addressing aspects such as the relative safety of a 400 mg dose of venetoclax and the requirement for a ramp‐up period to avoid tumor lysis syndrome (TLS).

- **Explaining TLS**: Discussing associated risk factors and mitigation protocols. For example, in the case of Patient A, I would explain that he is at high risk for TLS, but there are specific management strategies catered to his risk category.

Another consideration is the treatment of elderly patients, for whom the ramp‐up dose may pose a burden due to the necessity of frequent and potentially prolonged hospital visits. As seen with patients A and B, once venetoclax therapy is agreed upon, several steps are required before and after therapy is initiated. The following week-by-week strategy for venetoclax treatment initiation should be individualized, as not all patients will react similarly. Even in the absence of laboratory-detected TLS at lower doses, maintaining vigilance is crucial.

### Tumor lysis syndrome in premature infant prompting early resection of a large sacrococcygeal teratoma: A case report [^1139DEun]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Low credibility.

Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) is a life-threatening constellation of metabolic derangements characterized by hyperuricemia, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, and hypocalcemia, leading to acute renal failure. It is common in hematologic malignancies and following the initiation of chemotherapy. Traditionally, most solid tumors are considered low-risk for the development of TLS; however, bulky solid tumors, such as germ cell tumors, may be considered at intermediate risk.

The typical management of tumor lysis syndrome includes aggressive intravenous hydration to preclude renal injury. This must be carefully balanced in the very preterm infant, who is at particularly high risk of complications from fluid overload, including severe chronic lung disease and increased mortality. Rasburicase is a recombinant urate-oxidase enzyme that converts uric acid into an inactive and soluble metabolite, allantoin. There have been reports of the safe use of rasburicase in neonates in the setting of tumor lysis syndrome, though there is a risk of death with underlying glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency.

Notably, G6PD testing was not performed prior to the initiation of rasburicase in our patient due to the long turnaround time of this laboratory test and the time-sensitive nature of the treatment at a critical time point to preserve renal function. There was no family history suggestive of G6PD deficiency, the patient was a female, and there were no obvious signs of anemia or hemolysis on the peripheral blood smear.

### Tumor lysis syndrome in chronic lymphocytic leukemia with novel targeted agents [^115ZV9AP]. The Oncologist (2017). Low credibility.

Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) may occur either as laboratory TLS or clinical TLS. Laboratory TLS is more common and is defined by the occurrence of two or more electrolyte derangements (i.e. hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, hypocalcemia, hyperuricemia) within a 24-hour period in an asymptomatic patient, from 3 days before to 7 days after treatment [11].

Clinical TLS involves a rapid and extreme change in serum electrolytes consistent with laboratory TLS, with additional complications potentially leading to clinical sequelae. It can develop suddenly in conjunction with cancer treatment and represents a medical emergency requiring aggressive intervention [10]. Clinical complications may include nausea, vomiting, lethargy, edema, renal failure, congestive heart failure, and potentially sudden death. Less frequently observed is subacute TLS, characterized by gradual changes in laboratory values [10].

Historically, TLS was observed in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) treated with chemotherapy, where it was uncommon and not typically severe. The introduction of targeted agents that can cause rapid tumor reduction has increased the risk for TLS in these patients.

- **Criteria for TLS**:
	- Two sets of criteria are commonly used to define and classify TLS: the Cairo-Bishop and Howard criteria. The Cairo-Bishop criteria require two or more defined laboratory abnormalities with a 25% change from baseline, occurring at any time within 3 days before or 7 days after chemotherapy [11]. Howard et al. proposed that a 25% change from baseline is key in defining TLS.

### Tumor lysis syndrome in chronic lymphocytic leukemia with novel targeted agents [^113meV4a]. The Oncologist (2017). Low credibility.

Assessing patient risk and anticipating tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) when initiating highly effective therapies is key for prevention of clinically relevant TLS. Approaches to preventing TLS include laboratory monitoring, use of uric acid-reducing drugs, and adequate hydration. Hospitalization should be considered for patients at high risk. Protocols to monitor urine output and fluid balance, electrolytes (potassium, inorganic phosphorus, calcium), creatinine, and uric acid during initial dosing of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) treatment enable prompt identification and correction of abnormalities in laboratory findings.

A number of features factor into the risk of TLS in individual patients: high tumor burden and/or increased tumor turnover enhances the risk of TLS. However, different therapies may be associated with varying risk of TLS owing to tumor sensitivity to different mechanisms of action (e.g. risk of TLS with venetoclax could be higher than with idelalisib or rituximab). Close laboratory monitoring during the period of risk is highly recommended.

- **General guidelines**: Based on tumor burden as well as other factors (e.g. pre-existing chronic renal insufficiency, oliguria, splenomegaly, dehydration, hypotension, and acidic urine), it is recommended that:
	- Patients at high risk of TLS be monitored every 4–6 hours.
	- Patients at medium risk be monitored every 8–12 hours after initiation of therapy.
	- Low-risk patients be monitored daily.

Available guidelines are based on extensive experience with chemotherapy, and the general recommendation is that…

### Guidelines for the management of pediatric and adult tumor lysis syndrome: an evidence-based review [^112pG9fh]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2008). Low credibility.

Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) has recently been subclassified into either laboratory TLS or clinical TLS, and a grading system has been established. Standardized guidelines, however, are needed to aid in the stratification of patients according to risk and to establish prophylaxis and treatment recommendations for patients at risk or with established TLS.

- **Methods**: A panel of experts in pediatric and adult hematologic malignancies and TLS was assembled to develop recommendations and guidelines for TLS based on clinical evidence and standards of care. A review of relevant literature was also used.

- **Results**: New guidelines are presented regarding the prevention and management of patients at risk of developing TLS. The best management of TLS is prevention. Prevention strategies include hydration and prophylactic rasburicase in high-risk patients, hydration plus allopurinol or rasburicase for intermediate-risk patients, and close monitoring for low-risk patients. Primary management of established TLS involves similar recommendations, with the addition of aggressive hydration and diuresis, plus allopurinol or rasburicase for hyperuricemia. Alkalinization is not recommended. Although guidelines for rasburicase use in adults are provided, this agent is currently only approved for use in pediatric patients in the United States.

- **Conclusion**: The potential severity of complications resulting from TLS requires measures for prevention in high-risk patients and prompts treatment in the event that symptoms arise. Recognition of risk factors and monitoring of at-risk patients is crucial.

### Tumor lysis syndrome and acute kidney injury: evaluation, prevention, and management [^111XiWH8]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) describes a constellation of biochemical and clinical abnormalities resulting from rapid and massive tumor cell death. TLS is frequently associated with hyperuricemia, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, and secondary hypocalcemia that may lead to serious clinical complications, including acute kidney injury and cardiac arrest. Identification of tumor- and patient-specific risk factors for TLS and early recognition of laboratory and clinical TLS based on established criteria are essential for preventing TLS and forestalling acute kidney injury. Early collaboration between oncologists and nephrologists will help improve assessment of patients' kidney function and risk factors, paving the way for timely and efficacious interventions.

### Tumour lysis syndrome: new therapeutic strategies and classification [^116i6XAs]. British Journal of Haematology (2004). High credibility.

The Cairo-Bishop criteria is a clinical calculator used to diagnose laboratory tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) in patients with malignancies. This scoring system is particularly applicable to patients with high-grade lymphomas and acute leukemias, which are at high risk for TLS, but it can be used in any patient with a malignancy who is at risk for this syndrome.

The Cairo-Bishop criteria for laboratory TLS is based on changes in laboratory values from baseline, including hyperuricemia, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, and hypocalcemia. The clinical utility of this calculator is to identify patients who are experiencing TLS, a potentially life-threatening complication of cancer treatment characterized by rapid release of intracellular components into the bloodstream. Early identification of TLS allows for prompt initiation of treatment to prevent serious complications such as renal failure, cardiac arrhythmias, seizures, and death.

There are no specific exclusion criteria for the use of the Cairo-Bishop criteria. However, it should be noted that this scoring system is not applicable to patients without malignancies or those who are not at risk for TLS. Additionally, the calculator may not be as accurate in patients with pre-existing electrolyte abnormalities or renal dysfunction, as these conditions can also cause changes in the laboratory values used in diagnoses.

### Rasburicase in tumor lysis syndrome of the adult: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112GKM8h]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Use of rasburicase has been extensively evaluated in children, but not in adults. We review the literature to evaluate its effect on adults.

- **Study design**: Systematic review and meta-analysis.

- **Setting and population**: Adults receiving rasburicase for tumor lysis syndrome (TLS).

- **Selection criteria for studies**: Electronic databases, regulatory documents, and websites were searched up to August 7, 2012. Reference lists of published articles were examined for additional relevant references. Any controlled trial or observational study (controlled before and after) was included. Studies considering children only or mixing data for children and adults were excluded.

- **Intervention**: Rasburicase for TLS.

- **Outcomes**: The primary outcome was TLS development. Secondary outcomes included the percentage of patients improving, total adverse events, acute kidney failure, deaths, and serum uric acid and creatinine levels.

- **Results**: Twenty-one studies (24 publications) reported data for 1,261 adult patients, with 768 receiving rasburicase for either the treatment or prophylaxis of TLS. These comprised four controlled trials and seventeen observational studies. No statistically significant differences in clinical TLS development were observed in the controlled trials between the rasburicase and control groups. For the observational studies, 7.4% of patients developed clinical TLS after rasburicase (95% CI, 1.7%-16.7%), 93.4% of patients achieved normalized serum uric acid levels after rasburicase treatment (95% CI, 91.7%-94.6%), 4.4% developed acute kidney injury (95% CI, 3.0%-6.0%), and 2.6% di.

### Tumour lysis syndrome: a rare side effect of imatinib therapy for GIST [^117KcPGK]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Tumour lysis syndrome (TLS) is a life-threatening complication wherein massive tumour cell lysis results in severe metabolic abnormalities. TLS generally follows chemotherapy for rapidly proliferating haematological malignancies; however, spontaneous TLS and TLS resulting from the treatment of solid tumours are infrequently reported. We present a rare case of TLS following the treatment of a large gastrointestinal stromal tumour (GIST) in a 63-year-old man. Imatinib was started for tumour size reduction prior to surgical intervention, and in 5 days, the patient developed metabolic derangements consistent with TLS. Imatinib was held, and fluids, allopurinol, and rasburicase were started. All metabolic abnormalities resolved in 3 days. Imatinib was restarted, and he eventually underwent surgical intervention. This is the second case demonstrating successful reinitiation of imatinib following TLS when treating GIST. We highlight the importance of risk factor assessment and the need for pre-emptive therapy to prevent TLS when using tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy.

### Case report: Tumor lysis syndrome after quad shot in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma [^111YAFGo]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2023). High credibility.

For patients experiencing acute tumor lysis syndrome (TLS), several important biomarkers should be monitored, including whole blood count, uric acid, phosphate, and calcium. The TLS classification system prior to treatment aids in risk stratification. Given that diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is a high-risk entity, prophylaxis with allopurinol or rasburicase may be indicated. Prophylaxis for high-risk patients is supported by other case reports. The important biomarkers for TLS should be monitored at least daily.

- **Risk assessment and treatment algorithm**: Our case serves as a reminder for practices that see very few histologies at high risk for TLS to remain vigilant for this syndrome. There is also the question of what radiation dose is appropriate for these patients and whether TLS is a dose-limiting/dependent entity.

The tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) risk stratification and treatment algorithm can be referred to in Figure 3. Here are some key abbreviations: AKI = acute kidney injury; BUN = blood urea nitrogen; CBC = complete blood count; CKD = chronic kidney disease; CML = chronic myelogenous leukemia; CLL = chronic lymphocytic leukemia; CMP = comprehensive metabolic panel; DLBCL = diffuse large B-cell lymphoma; IVF = intravenous fluids; LDH = lactate dehydrogenase; MM = multiple myeloma; ULN = upper limit of normal; UOP = urine output; WNL = within normal limits.

### Approach to patients with hypophosphataemia [^117LCpxS]. The Lancet. Diabetes & Endocrinology (2020). Low credibility.

Phosphate metabolism is an evolving area of basic and clinical research. In the past 15 years, knowledge on disturbances of phosphate homeostasis has expanded, as has the discovery of new targeted therapies. Hypophosphataemia might be the biochemical finding in several diseases, and its clinical evaluation should initially focus on the assessment of pathophysiological mechanisms leading to low serum phosphate concentrations. Clinical consequences of hypophosphataemia can involve multiple organ systems and vary depending on several factors, the most important being the underlying disorder.

This review focuses on the approach to patients with hypophosphataemia and how underlying pathophysiological mechanisms should be understood in the evaluation of differential diagnosis. We define an algorithm for the assessment of hypophosphataemia and review the most up-to-date literature on specific therapies. Continuous research in this area will result in a better understanding and management of patients with hypophosphataemia.

### Tumor lysis syndrome in chronic lymphocytic leukemia with novel targeted agents [^112LMBu6]. The Oncologist (2017). Low credibility.

Adequate hydration is critical in the prevention of TLS to promote the excretion of uric acid and phosphate. Laboratory TLS can be managed as an outpatient with fluids and an oral hypouricemic agent. Oral hydration may be suitable for patients at low risk and some at medium risk of TLS. However, intravenous fluids are essential for patients at high risk and should be considered for some patients at medium risk of TLS. Aggressive hydration should be administered prior to therapy with the goal of a urine output of at least 100 mL per hour. Unless there is complete loss of kidney function, patients should receive aggressive intravenous fluids to achieve adequate fluid volume for sufficient renal output that should be maintained for 2 days prior to treatment, if possible, and 2–3 days following treatment. Prompt management of hyperkalemia is also crucial to prevention. Diuresis is rarely indicated and may be harmful in the setting of TLS. Thiazide diuretics may increase levels of uric acid and should be avoided. In patients with low urine output, careful administration of furosemide may be considered. Furosemide can also be used for the management of TLS to prevent severe fluid overload in patients receiving aggressive intravenous hydration.

Careful management of electrolytes is critical. There is generally no need to treat asymptomatic hypocalcemia because of the risk of precipitation of calcium in the kidneys. Hyperphosphatemia can often be managed with phosphate binders, and lowering phosphate levels will help with urate control.
