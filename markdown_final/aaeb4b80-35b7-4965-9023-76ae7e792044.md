## Question

what are the causes of erthyrocytosis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the causes of erythrocytosis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming true (absolute) erythrocytosis versus relative or spurious causes. Then, I should classify primary versus secondary etiologies and integrate the role of JAK2 testing. Next, I will enumerate secondary hypoxic, endocrine/tumor, drug-induced, and congenital causes. After that, I should consider idiopathic erythrocytosis and the evolving role of genetics. Finally, I will synthesize a practical diagnostic approach and highlight special scenarios and controversies, including thrombotic risk and management implications.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic foundation: erythrocytosis should be defined by persistent elevation of hemoglobin/hematocrit above sex-specific thresholds and confirmed on repeat testing to avoid spurious or transient elevations. I should also distinguish absolute erythrocytosis (increased red cell mass) from relative erythrocytosis (plasma volume contraction) and from extreme high-normal outliers, because misclassification here derails the entire workup [^11686JZY] [^112F5YdM].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to check the primary clonal cause first. Polycythemia vera (PV) is the prototypical primary erythrocytosis driven by JAK2 mutations (V617F in ~98% and exon 12 in a minority), with autonomous erythroid proliferation and characteristically low or inappropriately normal EPO; therefore, early JAK2 testing plus EPO level is pivotal to separate PV from secondary causes before chasing hypoxia or tumors [^1177Jv8R] [^116UaRBV] [^112F5YdM].

> Next, I should review secondary hypoxic causes, because these are common and actionable. Chronic hypoxemia from COPD, interstitial lung disease, obstructive sleep apnea, high altitude, and cyanotic congenital heart disease can all drive compensatory EPO-mediated erythrocytosis; wait, let me verify the OSA point — severe OSA correlates with nocturnal hypoxemia, but AHI itself does not predict erythrocytosis, and neocytolysis plus inflammation may blunt expected rises, so awake/mean nocturnal SpO2 and oximetry are more informative than AHI alone [^115VpFNG] [^114BYwor] [^116PdNtQ].

> I will now examine endocrine and tumor-mediated erythrocytosis. EPO-secreting tumors such as renal cell carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, and cerebellar hemangioblastoma can cause secondary erythrocytosis; I should double-check that renal tumors are indeed a classic cause with a long historical literature base supporting this association, which they are, and I must remember that post–renal transplant erythrocytosis is common and often responsive to ACE inhibitors or ARBs rather than venesection [^114s1Z5Q] [^116WW3Ya] [^114foC2y].

> Let me consider drug-induced erythrocytosis carefully, because it is increasingly prevalent. Testosterone and other androgens are the most common culprits, with erythrocytosis rates up to ~67% in some cohorts, higher with intramuscular formulations, higher doses, and older age; guidelines suggest holding testosterone if hematocrit exceeds 54% and using phlebotomy as needed, though evidence for hard outcomes is limited and management should be individualized [^112X8KKL] [^112pqX6G] [^114NKrEW].

> But wait, what if the drug is an SGLT-2 inhibitor? I should confirm the signal. SGLT-2 inhibitors increase hematocrit via osmotic diuresis and EPO stimulation, with erythrocytosis rates around 10–22% in some series; importantly, most observational data do not show increased thromboembolism, and some analyses even associate mild SGLT-2–related erythrocytosis with fewer heart failure hospitalizations, though a recent randomized analysis suggested possible harm in men with baseline erythrocytosis — so I need to reconcile these mixed signals and avoid overgeneralization [^112X8KKL] [^116doRxQ] [^115Ab9cK] [^116GWY1N].

> I should also review other medications. Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents can cause iatrogenic erythrocytosis, antiangiogenic TKIs have been associated with erythrocytosis in cancer populations, and even a multidrug-resistant tuberculosis regimen has been implicated. The key is to correlate medication timing with CBC changes and to reassess after drug withdrawal when feasible [^112X8KKL] [^11432gck].

> Now, let me think about congenital and hereditary causes, which I must not overlook in young patients or those with a family history. Primary congenital erythrocytosis includes EPOR gain-of-function mutations with low EPO, while secondary congenital forms include high oxygen-affinity hemoglobinopathies, 2,3-BPG deficiency, and oxygen-sensing pathway mutations in VHL, PHD2/EGLN1, and HIF2A/EPAS1; I should confirm that VHL-related Chuvash polycythemia carries a particularly high thrombotic risk and warrants careful counseling and follow-up [^112F5YdM] [^1128FsYu] [^112qK5wp].

> Hmm, wait a minute — what if extensive testing is unrevealing? Idiopathic erythrocytosis remains a diagnosis of exclusion, but I need to ensure I have truly excluded PV with JAK2, secondary hypoxia, tumors, and drugs; contemporary data suggest many "idiopathic" cases harbor subtle genetic variants, so extended NGS panels can be considered when suspicion remains high, and I should avoid prematurely labeling a case as idiopathic without a thorough review of longitudinal labs and exposures [^1161c2nN] [^112F5YdM] [^117EA5kW].

> Next, I should review a practical diagnostic algorithm. Start with confirmatory CBCs, a focused history (smoking, altitude, sleep, cardiopulmonary disease, drugs, testosterone/androgens, family history), and exam. Then obtain JAK2 V617F/exon 12 testing and serum EPO to triage PV versus secondary causes. If JAK2 is negative and EPO is high, pursue hypoxia evaluation (oximetry, sleep study, pulmonary function, ABG) and imaging for EPO-secreting tumors. If EPO is low and suspicion for PV persists, consider bone marrow biopsy. If lifelong erythrocytosis or family history is present, evaluate for congenital causes including hemoglobin electrophoresis, P50, and targeted or panel genetic testing [^112F5YdM] [^11686JZY] [^116qknwP].

> Hold on, I should verify special scenarios that modify management. In post–renal transplant erythrocytosis, ACE inhibitors or ARBs are first-line and venesection is reserved for refractory cases. In cyanotic congenital heart disease, routine phlebotomy is discouraged unless hyperviscosity symptoms occur with very high hematocrit, and iron deficiency must be corrected carefully. In OSA, CPAP can reduce erythrocytosis indirectly via improved oxygenation. In COPD, long-term oxygen may be indicated for severe hypoxemia and venesection to 0.50–0.52 can improve symptoms, but overcorrection is harmful [^114foC2y] [^112TvkAd] [^115VpFNG].

> I need to ensure I address thrombotic risk and management nuances. Elevated hematocrit alone does not fully explain thrombosis across erythrocytoses; cellular and molecular changes in PV and some congenital forms contribute independently, and in secondary erythrocytosis, cardiovascular risk factors often cluster and may drive events more than hematocrit per se; venesection may not reduce thrombotic risk in secondary or idiopathic cases, so I should individualize phlebotomy to symptoms and avoid reflexive cytoreduction outside PV [^111249Gw] [^112RGFJZ] [^113ebeSQ].

> Let me reconsider the SGLT-2 question one more time to avoid overstatement. While meta-analyses and observational cohorts generally show no increased thromboembolism and potential heart failure benefits with mild erythrocytosis, a randomized analysis of canagliflozin suggested possible harm in men with baseline erythrocytosis. Given this heterogeneity, I should confirm there is no occult PV or hypoxia, monitor closely, and engage in shared decision-making about continuation, dose change, or phlebotomy if hematocrit rises substantially [^115Ab9cK] [^116GWY1N] [^115jF9TU].

> In summary, I should double-check that my final synthesis remains clinically actionable: erythrocytosis reflects either autonomous erythroid proliferation (PV and rare congenital primaries) or EPO-driven compensation (hypoxia, tumors, drugs), with idiopathic cases shrinking as genetics advance. A disciplined, stepwise workup anchored by JAK2/EPO, careful exclusion of secondary causes, and context-specific management yields the best outcomes and prevents mislabeling and overtreatment [^112F5YdM] [^11686JZY] [^1161c2nN].

Erythrocytosis arises from **increased red cell mass** [^112qK5wp] due to either **primary marrow disorders** (e.g. polycythemia vera [^116UaRBV], congenital EPOR mutations) [^1128FsYu] or **secondary drivers of erythropoietin excess** (hypoxia, EPO-secreting tumors, testosterone, SGLT-2 inhibitors) [^112X8KKL] [^116mfAx6]. Additional contributors include high-altitude living, smoking, renal artery stenosis, and post-transplant erythrocytosis [^114KoTQ2] [^1126GtkK]. Evaluation should start with **JAK2 testing and EPO** [^1172nQUo] to distinguish primary from secondary causes, followed by targeted workup for hypoxia, tumors, drugs, and genetics [^113F3KVi].

---

## Primary erythrocytosis (polycythemia vera and related disorders)

Primary erythrocytosis reflects **intrinsic marrow defects** with erythroid proliferation independent of EPO [^114KoTQ2]; serum EPO is low or inappropriately normal [^1172nQUo] [^112DVQRU].

- **Polycythemia vera (PV)**: Clonal myeloproliferative neoplasm driven by JAK2 V617F or exon 12 mutations [^1172nQUo]; erythroid precursors proliferate autonomously with low EPO [^112Ak6Mm].
- **Congenital erythrocytosis**: Germline EPOR gain-of-function mutations cause hypersensitivity to EPO and low EPO [^1128FsYu] [^114q47Rx].
- **Primary familial polycythemia**: Autosomal dominant EPOR mutations with low EPO and increased erythroid mass [^1128FsYu].

---

## Secondary erythrocytosis (increased erythropoietin production)

Secondary erythrocytosis results from **increased EPO** from hypoxia or inappropriate EPO production [^114KoTQ2].

---

### Hypoxia-driven erythrocytosis

- **Chronic hypoxia**: COPD, interstitial lung disease, and high-altitude living increase EPO [^1172nQUo] [^114KoTQ2].
- **Obstructive sleep apnea**: Intermittent hypoxia elevates EPO; erythrocytosis is uncommon and often mild [^114BYwor] [^116PdNtQ].
- **Cyanotic congenital heart disease**: Right-to-left shunting causes hypoxemia and EPO-driven erythrocytosis [^116mfAx6].

---

### Erythropoietin-secreting tumors

- **Renal cell carcinoma**: Common EPO-secreting tumor causing erythrocytosis [^114s1Z5Q].
- **Hepatocellular carcinoma**: Can secrete EPO and cause erythrocytosis [^1163QZy3].
- **Hemangioblastoma**: Cerebellar tumors associated with EPO secretion and erythrocytosis [^1163QZy3].

---

### Drug-induced erythrocytosis

- **Testosterone therapy**: Increases EPO and erythropoiesis; erythrocytosis is common [^112pqX6G] [^112X8KKL].
- **SGLT-2 inhibitors**: Increase hematocrit via osmotic diuresis and possible EPO stimulation [^112X8KKL] [^1148hnVQ].
- **Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents**: Directly stimulate erythropoiesis and can cause erythrocytosis [^114q47Rx].

---

### Post-transplant erythrocytosis

Post-transplant erythrocytosis occurs in **~10–15% of renal transplant recipients**, likely from graft ischemia or renin-angiotensin activation [^1126GtkK] [^114foC2y].

---

## Relative erythrocytosis (pseudoerythrocytosis)

Relative erythrocytosis reflects **reduced plasma volume** with normal red cell mass, yielding elevated Hb/Hct [^11686JZY].

- **Dehydration**: Vomiting, diarrhea, or diuretics reduce plasma volume [^113ebeSQ].
- **Gaisböck syndrome**: Hypertension with relative erythrocytosis [^notfound].

---

## Diagnostic approach

A **structured approach** is essential to classify erythrocytosis [^114q47Rx]:

1. **Confirm absolute erythrocytosis**: Repeat CBC; exclude relative causes [^11686JZY]
2. **JAK2 mutation testing**: Identify PV (JAK2-positive) [^1177Jv8R]
3. **Serum erythropoietin level**: Distinguish primary (low) vs secondary (normal/high) [^1172nQUo]
4. **Evaluate hypoxia**: Pulse oximetry, ABG, sleep study, pulmonary function tests [^114BYwor]
5. **Imaging**: Renal ultrasound/CT for EPO-secreting tumors [^notfound]
6. **Genetic testing**: Consider EPOR, VHL, PHD2, HIF2A mutations if congenital suspected [^112F5YdM]

---

Erythrocytosis reflects increased red cell mass from primary marrow disorders, secondary EPO drivers, or relative plasma volume contraction; **JAK2 and EPO testing** efficiently separate primary from secondary causes, guiding targeted evaluation and management [^1172nQUo].

Myomatous erythrocytosis syndrome (MES) is a rare form of secondary erythrocytosis seen with myomas. Here, we present a case of a postmenopausal, nulliparous woman in her 50s incidentally found to have asymptomatic erythrocytosis on routine laboratory work. She was found to have an 18.5cm myoma and after surgical resection, the patient's haematological values returned to normal ranges after a few weeks. This established the diagnosis as MES. The aetiology of MES continues to remain unknown but is most likely caused by an autonomous production of erythropoietin from the myomatous tissue. This case highlights obtaining a detailed history and physical examination to differentiate between the different causes of erythrocytosis, considering MES as a rare cause of secondary erythrocytosis and to prevent unnecessary procedures such as phlebotomy as surgery is the mainstay of treatment.

Conclusion

Anemia is a common sign with protean causes and manifestations. A systematic approach to evaluation and management of anemia ensures appropriate care that may optimize hemoglobin and potentially ameliorate anemia-related morbidity while minimizing unnecessary testing. Nevertheless, further research is necessary because often anemia in older age has no discernible cause or proven therapy.

Management of secondary erythrocytosis

Idiopathic erythrocytosis

Idiopathic erythrocytosis (IE) is a diagnosis of exclusion. It is an absolute erythrocytosis of no identifiable cause that is more frequent in males (Randi et al, 2016). Every effort should be made to exclude identifiable primary and secondary causes of erythrocytosis (including PV and congenital erythrocytosis) before a diagnosis of IE is made. Erythropoietin (EPO) levels are unhelpful as they are below normal in a third of patients, suggesting a primary erythrocytosis, and elevated in two‐thirds, suggesting a secondary erythrocytosis. Recent studies using sequencing analysis have identified a number of patients who were previously diagnosed with IE as having mutations in either erythrocytosis‐associated genes or novel genes (Bento et al, 2014; Camps et al, 2016), suggesting that at least some of these cases have a genetic basis.

Although previous data suggested that the risk of thrombosis and/or haemorrhage was considerably elevated in IE, these observations were based on old evidence that predated the identification of the JAK2 V617F mutation and therefore some patients with PV are likely to have been included in the study cohorts. More contemporary data suggests that the risk of thrombosis/bleeding is low in IE (Bertozzi et al, 2017). There are no clinical studies evaluating the use of aspirin or venesection in IE and therefore evidence‐based recommendations cannot be made. Cytoreductive therapy is not indicated in patients with IE. The thrombotic risk factors should be evaluated in each case and, in selected cases, the Hct can be controlled by venesection. There is no evidence on which to determine the target Hct as relevance of data from PV patients for IE is unclear. A pragmatic approach is required for these patients with rigorous control of vascular risk factors, such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension and smoking and use of aspirin in cases where this would be otherwise clinically indicated for primary or secondary prevention. It would be reasonable to venesect patients with an arbitrary target Hct of < 0·55, although a lower target Hct of < 0·45 may be appropriate for a patient with a history of thrombosis considered to be related to the erythrocytosis.

### Diagnosis, management, and outcomes of drug-induced erythrocytosis: a systematic review [^113YdgKi]. Blood Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

There are several limitations to this review. Our review was limited to peer-reviewed literature; as such, it is inherently limited by publication bias, and we cannot exclude the possibility of relevant studies in other databases that were not searched. There was significant heterogeneity in the included studies, including the types, formulations, and doses of medications as well as in the study quality and designs, with most of the studies being retrospective in nature. As such, the rates of thromboembolism are difficult to interpret, particularly given the lack of reporting for baseline risk of thromboembolism in these studies. Furthermore, several of the findings discussed in this review were demonstrated in relatively small patient populations and may not be generalizable. Nonetheless, our findings demonstrate the heterogeneous nature of drug-induced erythrocytosis and identify multiple classes of medications that may be implicated in erythrocytosis. Further studies would be helpful to establish a clinical approach to drug-induced erythrocytosis and to clarify clinical outcomes in this condition.

Suggestions for clinical practice

Due to the heterogeneity of these patient populations and of the included studies, there is limited evidence to guide clinical practice for drug-induced erythrocytosis. Based on this systematic review of existing literature, we suggest the following.

General recommendations

All patients starting the medications covered in this review should be counseled on the risks of developing erythrocytosis and associated thrombosis risk, while acknowledging that high-quality evidence for the latter is lacking for most medications. We suggest that physicians monitor patients for drug-induced erythrocytosis with a CBC after initiating treatment, with the frequency of ongoing monitoring depending on the type of medication and its indication. The role of phlebotomy or aspirin is uncertain, and these interventions may not be sufficient to mitigate thrombosis risk. Practitioners should discuss the risks and benefits of each treatment and engage in shared decision-making. If relevant, enrollment in a clinical trial or prospective registry should be considered.

### Testosterone therapy and secondary erythrocytosis [^115UrdKH]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Secondary erythrocytosis is one of the most common adverse events associated with testosterone therapy (TT). Upon encountering this, clinicians will often either adjust TT dosing, stop therapy, order a phlebotomy, or recommend a combination of these. Despite this, the evidence for secondary polycythemia causing harm during TT is scarce, and the hematocrit-based cutoffs present in multiple guidelines appear to be arbritrarily chosen. In this review, we present the pathophysiology behind TT and secondary erythrocytosis, the evidence connecting TT, secondary erythrocytosis and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), and the data supporting varying interventions upon diagnosis of secondary erythrocytosis.

### Comprehensiveand functional studies for classification ofgenetic variants identified in patients with erythrocytosis [^112qK5wp]. Haematologica (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Erythrocytoses are characterized by an elevated red cell mass of more than 125% of the predicted value for the age and body mass of the subject, usually reflected by increased levels of hemoglobin (Hb) and/or hematocrit (Ht) values. Erythrocytoses can be acquired as in the primary polycythemia vera, a myeloproliferative neoplasm as a consequence of a gain of function mutation in the JAK2 gene (p. Val617Phe), or secondary to diverse pathological situations (pulmonary or heart disease, kidney cancer, carbon monoxide poisoning, etc.) due to an increased secretion of erythropoietin (EPO). On the other hand, erythrocytosis can be observed in a context of inherited disease, which can be primary when there is an intrinsic defect in the progenitor cells of the bone marrow (EPOR mutations), or secondary when the oxygen-sensing pathway is dysregulated and EPO is produced at a high level (VHL, EGLN1/PHD2, EPAS1/HIF2A mutations).

### JAK2 unmutated erythrocytosis: current diagnostic approach and therapeutic views [^11686JZY]. Leukemia (2021). Medium credibility.

Diagnostic approach

In clinical practice, hematology referrals for erythrocytosis are triggered by Hgb/Hct level above 16.5 g/dl/49% and 16 g/dl/48% in Caucasian males and females, respectively, and should be confirmed by at least two separate blood counts evaluated at different time points. This should be followed by distinguishing true from apparent erythrocytosis; the former is a result of either a clonal MPN, as in PV, or a non-clonal process resulting in secondary erythrocytosis. It is also important to recognize inapparent (masked) erythrocytosis in which an increase in red cell mass (RCM) is accompanied by a concomitant increase in plasma volume and therefore masked by a normal Hgb/Hct. Similarly, in situations with normal Hgb/Hct and concomitant iron deficiency, PV is often underrecognized. Conversely, an apparent erythrocytosis may result from either a reduction in plasma volume (relative erythrocytosis) or extreme high normal values which exceed the 95th percentile of sex-, race-and altitude-adjusted normal values. RCM measurement is no longer available at our institution; however, upon evaluation of its performance and practical utility in a total of 105 patients with erythrocytosis; elevated RCM was seen in 76%, 20%, 21%, and 57% with PV, secondary erythrocytosis, apparent erythrocytosis, and essential thrombocythemia, respectively. In the particular study RCM significantly correlated with both Hct and Hgb levels (p < 0.001). Hgb/Hct values below which an elevated RCM was not observed were 16/48% for males and 13/39% for females. In contrast, values > 19.5/58% for males and 17.5/53% for females were almost always associated with increased RCM. In other words, RCM measurement was found to be suboptimal in distinguishing PV from other causes of erythrocytosis and failed to offer any additional diagnostic value. Furthermore, obesity is a confounding factor that hinders accurate interpretation of RCM values.

Regarding specific circumstances for polycythemia vera, more specifically with respect to patients with post-transplant erythrocytosis, BSH 2019 guidelines recommend to initiate ACEis (such as captopril or enalapril) or ARBs (such as losartan) in patients with post-transplant erythrocytosis.

### Low incidence ofmutations in idiopathic erythrocytosis [^115RspYh]. Haematologica (2021). Medium credibility.

Since the discovery of JAK2 mutations, the etiological diagnosis of erythrocytosis has been greatly facilitated. When positive, the diagnosis of polycythemia vera (PV) is highly probable; when negative, it is necessary to focus on secondary causes, particularly hypoxia due to cardiorespiratory diseases or tumor-related causes. However, the cause of erythrocytosis often remains unknown even after extensive investigation, which leads to the diagnosis of idiopathic erythrocytosis, or primary familial and congenital polycythemia. We report here the low incidence of mutation (1.1%) in the erythropoietin receptor (EPOR) gene in a large series of 270 consecutive unrelated cases with primary familial and congenital polycythemia. Three mutations in the EPOR gene were observed, two of which have already been reported as pathogenic (Pro381Glnfs*2 and Ser407*). The third mutation is a new variant (Ser432Alafs*21) that was discovered in one patient from New Caledonia. Interestingly, a different French laboratory found the same variant in three other patients from New Caledonia without known family ties.

Management of acute thrombotic events

Acute thrombotic events should be managed according to current guidelines. Cytoreductive therapy should be instituted to ensure control of blood counts to the therapeutic target. Venesection to reduce the Hct to < 0·45 should be undertaken if it is not controlled at the time of acute thrombosis. For arterial thrombosis, low dose aspirin should be offered to all patients, and specialist advice should be sought.

For venous thromboembolism (VTE), anticoagulation should be commenced. Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) remains the first choice in the acute setting, followed by vitamin K antagonists (VKA) as per guidelines (NICE, 2012). Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are increasingly used in the non‐MPN population for prophylaxis and VTE therapy. However, there is limited data for their specific use in MPN, where they appear to be safe and efficacious (Ianotto et al, 2017).

Secondary prevention of thrombosis

Indefinite anticoagulation for VTE is recommended because of the presence of continuing risk (NICE 2012; Watson et al, 2015; Kearon et al, 2016). In MPN, the role of continuing anticoagulation, particularly in VTE, has been assessed by several studies. Around a third of patients who stop anticoagulation after initial treatment suffer a recurrence (Barosi et al, 2013; Kaifie et al, 2016). Two retrospective studies (Hernández‐Boluda et al, 2015; De Stefano et al, 2016a) showed that cessation of VKA after 3 months of treatment for a first VTE in MPN patients increased the risk of recurrent thrombosis compared with continued treatment. The later study also suggested a role for VKA in reducing the risk of arterial thrombotic recurrence and the possible benefit of adding aspirin to VKA to prevent recurrent arterial thrombosis. We are unable to make a specific recommendation about the addition of aspirin to VKA when a secondary thrombosis occurs in a patient already on VKA, as there is not yet evidence to support this. However, trials of this combination are in progress in other conditions and evidence may emerge.

For unprovoked VTE, where there is no physical precipitating factor, we therefore recommend indefinite anticoagulation to reduce the incidence of recurrence. In a significant number of patients with recurrent thrombosis (De Stefano et al, 2008), cell counts were sub‐optimally controlled. Cytoreduction should therefore be reviewed to ensure optimal counts are achieved. For recurrent arterial events, specialist advice should be sought from cardiovascular, stroke or vascular physicians.

### JAK2 unmutated erythrocytosis: 2026 update on diagnosis and management [^111vEPYW]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). Medium credibility.

Disease Overview

JAK2 unmutated erythrocytosis encompasses a heterogeneous spectrum of hereditary and acquired entities.

Diagnosis

The foremost step is excluding polycythemia vera (PV) with JAK2 mutation screening (exons 12–15). Apparent polycythemia such as physiological outliers or relative polycythemia secondary to volume contraction should be considered. A historical overview of hematocrit (Hct) and hemoglobin (Hgb) levels helps distinguish longstanding from acquired erythrocytosis. Serum erythropoietin (Epo) levels are variably informative.

Hereditary Erythrocytosis

Hereditary erythrocytosis should be considered in longstanding erythrocytosis with a positive family history; causes include EPOR mutations (subnormal Epo), high oxygen affinity hemoglobin variants, PIEZO1 mutations, 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate deficiency, methemoglobinemia, and germline oxygen sensing pathway mutations (HIF2A-PHD2-VHL).

Acquired Erythrocytosis

Acquired erythrocytosis results from central (cardiopulmonary disease) or peripheral (renal artery stenosis) hypoxia, Epo-producing tumors (renal cell carcinoma) or drugs (testosterone, sodium glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2-i), erythropoiesis stimulating agents).

Idiopathic Erythrocytosis

Idiopathic erythrocytosis is an ill-defined terminology that presumes the existence of an increased Hgb/Hct level without an identifiable etiology.

Management

Cytoreductive therapy should be avoided. Phlebotomy should be considered for symptom control. Cardiovascular risk optimization and low-dose aspirin are advised, while the role of HIF2A inhibitors remains unclear.

Recent Advances

EPO mutations which produce hyperactive, hepatic-like Epo were identified. In cases with negative workup but high clinical suspicion, an expanded next generation sequencing panel for hereditary erythrocytosis is recommended. Among drugs, SGLT2-i-associated erythrocytosis is increasingly recognized.

Future Directions

Advances in molecular hematology are expected to improve the characterization of "idiopathic erythrocytosis". Results from prospective studies are needed to elucidate the underlying pathology and guide management.

### Treatment… [^112Ak6Mm]. AAFP (2004). Low credibility.

Polycythemia vera is a chronic myeloproliferative disorder characterized by an increased red blood cell mass, or erythrocytosis, which leads to hyperviscosity and an increased risk of thrombosis. Patients may present with complaints of pruritus after bathing, burning pains in the distal extremities, gastrointestinal disturbances, or nonspecific complaints such as weakness, headaches, or dizziness. Other patients are diagnosed after an incidental finding of an elevated hemoglobin and/or hematocrit level on a complete blood count. 3 PV also should be suspected in patients with portal venous thrombosis and splenomegaly with or without thrombocytosis and leukocytosis. Other signs and symptoms are listed in Table 1. 1, 4 In making the diagnosis of PV, the physician must first exclude a secondary erythrocytosis. The rightsholder did not grant rights to reproduce this item in electronic media.

For the missing item, see the original print version of this publication. Serum erythropoietin, bone marrow histopathology and karyotype, and the presence of endogenous erythroid colonies have been proposed as diagnostic tests for PV. Because PV is an autonomous erythroid proliferation, serum EPO levels in PV are low or normal. 1, 5 Low-serum EPO levels for PV have a sensitivity of 70 percent and a specificity of 90 percent. 1 In PV, bone marrow displays characteristic histologic findings. 10 and clonal cytogenetic abnormalities can be detected. 5 Use of this test requires the availability of a histologist who is specially trained in marrow histology. Finally, EEC growth is based on the ability of erythroid cells from peripheral blood and bone marrow samples in PV to grow in vitro without the addition of EPO.

12, 13 This unique finding, along with serum EPO levels, forms the basis for a new diagnostic approach, 5 but has the disadvantages of expense and limited availability.
10. Although serum EPO levels and marrow biopsies may become a routine diagnostic option, the PVSG criteria remain the standard of diagnosis. Consultation with a hematologist is appropriate to aid in diagnosis, and serum EPO levels and bone marrow biopsy should be considered if available. An algorithm summarizing the evaluation and management of PV is presented in.

### A guideline for the management of specific situations in polycythaemia vera and secondary erythrocytosis: a British Society for Haematology guideline [^113Ehg6P]. British Journal of Haematology (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The previous BSH guideline for the management of erythrocytosis was published in 2005 (McMullin et al, 2005) and amended in 2007 (McMullin et al, 2007). Here, we re‐evaluate the literature formulate guidance on the management of specific situations encountered in polycythaemia vera (PV) and the management of the other types of secondary erythrocytosis. Recommendations for the diagnostic pathway of investigation of an erythrocytosis, risk stratification and management of PV are in the accompanying guideline (McMullin et al, 2018). We review evidence and outline guidance on management of acute thrombotic events and secondary prevention of thrombosis in PV. The unusual thrombotic events, splanchnic vein and cerebral vein thromboses are discussed and haemorrhage. The specific situations of surgery and pregnancy and guidance on management of pruritus are included. The evidence for the management of other causes of erythrocytosis, including idiopathic erythrocytosis, congenital erythrocytosis, hypoxic pulmonary disease and post‐transplant erythrocytosis, is reviewed and recommendations made.

### Adult-onset hypogonadism [^112NnRJn]. Mayo Clinic Proceedings (2016). Medium credibility.

Erythrocytosis with testosterone therapy — Androgens have an erythrogenic effect with elevations in hemoglobin (Hb) and hematocrit (Hct); during TT, Hb and Hct rise for the first 5 to 6 months, then plateau, and decline to baseline within 3 to 12 months after discontinuation, with injectable formulations associated with the greatest increases. Prospective RCTs have not shown a direct relationship between TT-induced erythrocytosis and cardiovascular events, and a meta-analysis did not support a causal role for testosterone supplementation in adverse cardiovascular events. Management guidance states that Hct values higher than 54% warrant discontinuation of TT until further assessment; if Hct becomes markedly elevated, phlebotomy should be considered, and patients newly diagnosed with hypertension before or during TT warrant close monitoring.

### Diagnosis, management, and outcomes of drug-induced erythrocytosis: a systematic review [^112X8KKL]. Blood Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Secondary erythrocytosis refers to an elevation in hemoglobin or hematocrit due to elevated serum erythropoietin levels. Medications including testosterone and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors are increasingly recognized as causes of secondary erythrocytosis. We conducted a systematic review to inform the clinical management of drug-induced erythrocytosis. Following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, we performed a systematic literature search in MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL (all via Ovid), and Google Scholar. Of the 2036 articles screened for eligibility, 45 studies were included in our review, with 35 studies on testosterone and other androgen use, 5 studies on SGLT-2 inhibitors, 3 studies on antiangiogenic tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), 1 study on erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, and 1 study on a treatment regimen for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. Cisgender and transgender men on prescription testosterone had erythrocytosis rates of up to 66.7%, with intramuscular formulations, higher doses, and older age associated with increased risk of erythrocytosis. Up to 2.7% of men on testosterone therapy developed thromboembolic events. Among individuals on SGLT-2 inhibitors, erythrocytosis rates ranged from 2.1% to 22%, with those who discontinued therapy demonstrating improvement or resolution of erythrocytosis. Thromboembolic events were reported in up to 10% of these individuals. Antiangiogenic TKIs were studied in patients with cancer, with erythrocytosis developing in up to 43.5% of patients. Drug-induced erythrocytosis is a heterogeneous condition for which there is no clear consensus among clinicians about its diagnosis and management. We offer recommendations for clinical practice within the scope of this systematic review, although further research is required.

### JAK2 unmutated erythrocytosis: current diagnostic approach and therapeutic views [^115vVE8v]. Leukemia (2021). Medium credibility.

Management

A dearth of compelling evidence defining optimal management strategies for JAK2 unmutated erythrocytosis stems from the heterogeneity in associated hereditary and acquired disorders. Hence, it is common practice to inadvertently extrapolate outcomes from studies conducted in PV patients or follow consensus guidelines. In order to formulate our recommendations that have been summarized in Fig. 3, we reviewed the relevant literature pertaining to secondary erythrocytosis associated with common acquired and hereditary conditions (Table 1). Data regarding thrombosis risk in acquired secondary erythrocytosis has been conflicting; while the majority of studies do not support an increased thrombotic risk, two recent studies have implied the contrary. In a noteworthy large population-based series, erythrocytosis defined by higher Hgb/Hct thresholds, as per the 2008 WHO criteria, was associated with higher cardiovascular morbidity and mortality; however, details of conditions associated with erythrocytosis were not specified but a high incidence (38%) of clonal hematopoiesis and cardiovascular risk factors were reported accounting for a higher incidence of cardiovascular events. In a second smaller series of 35 patients with secondary erythrocytosis, thrombosis rates at or prior to diagnosis were similar to those reported in PV, which is likely explained by the clustering of cardiovascular risk factors in those with secondary erythrocytosis.

### How to approach chronic anemia [^116116vp]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2012). Low credibility.

We present herein an approach to diagnosing the cause of chronic anemia based on a patient's history and complete blood cell count (CBC). Four patterns that are encountered frequently in CBCs associated with chronic anemias are considered: (1) anemia with abnormal platelet and/or leukocyte counts, (2) anemia with increased reticulocyte counts, (3) life-long history of chronic anemia, and (4) anemia with inappropriately low reticulocytes. The pathophysiologic bases for some chronic anemias with low reticulocyte production are reviewed in terms of the bone marrow (BM) events that reduce normal rates of erythropoiesis. These events include: apoptosis of erythroid progenitor and precursor cells by intrinsic and extrinsic factors, development of macrocytosis when erythroblast DNA replication is impaired, and development of microcytosis due to heme-regulated eIF2α kinase inhibition of protein synthesis in iron-deficient or thalassemic erythroblasts.

### Does untreated obstructive sleep apnea cause secondary erythrocytosis? [^114BYwor]. Respiratory Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The current literature suggests a relationship between obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) severity and hematocrit. However, the degree that OSA contributes to clinically significant erythrocytosis is uncertain. The aim of this study is to evaluate this association in a large study sample controlling for multiple confounders.

Methods

We evaluated consecutive subjects with suspected untreated OSA using multivariate analysis to test the associations between apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) and hematocrit. Subjects were evaluated with sleep studies, comprehensive sleep questionnaires, and detailed electronic medical record reviews to document their medical comorbidities, and demographic and laboratory information.

Results

1604 consecutive veterans (age 57.6 ± 13.4 years, 92% male) were included in the analysis with 77.4% diagnosed with OSA. However, few included subjects (1.6%) had clinical erythrocytosis. OSA severity defined by AHI was not associated with hematocrit or clinically significant erythrocytosis. Rather, awake oxygen saturation (-0.17 points, p < 0.001) and mean nocturnal oxygen saturation (-0.08 points, p = 0.04) were inversely proportional to hematocrit (per standardized Z-score). Other factors including active tobacco, increased alcohol ingestion and exogenous testosterone therapy were associated with higher hematocrit. Although AHI was not predictive of erythrocytosis, having severe OSA was predictive of nocturnal hypoxemia (adjusted OR 7.4, p < 0.001).

Conclusions

Hematocrit levels and presence of erythrocytosis appear not associated with OSA severity, but rather with hypoxemia as measured by awake and to a lesser extent mean nocturnal oxygen saturation. Nocturnal oximetry may provide diagnostic utility in the evaluation of unexplained secondary polycythemia and polysomongraphy may be warranted in those with unexplained nocturnal hypoxemia and erythrocytosis.

### Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease burden, grades and erythrocytosis at a tertiary hospital in Western Uganda [^1163QZy3]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Background

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) affects people of all age groups, races, and continents. Several studies reporting the prevalence of the disease have been found to underestimate or overestimate the figures because they did not perform spirometry. Among all causes of death, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the third most common. Nearly 80% of COPD-related fatalities, including those in the majority of African nations, are thought to occur in low- and middle-income countries due to exposure to risk factors.

Africa is facing an increasing burden of non-communicable diseases, and COPD is among them, with an overall prevalence of 1.568% in Sub-Saharan Africa. There are variations in COPD prevalence depending on where one resides, even within the same country. In Uganda, the rural and urban COPD prevalence rates are 6.1% and 1.5%, respectively.

COPD is associated with hypoxemia, resulting in complications such as pulmonary hypertension, erythrocytosis, neurocognitive dysfunction, and systemic inflammation. These eventually contribute to other complications, such as acute exacerbations and cardiovascular disorders. Some patients may only present during complications and the associated poor prognosis.

Erythrocytosis as a complication of COPD is diagnosed following findings of haemoglobin (Hb) concentration of Hb > 16.5 g/dl or hematocrit (HCT) > 49% in males and Hb > 16 g/dl or HCT > 48% in females. It is also known as acquired erythrocytosis. It arises from high levels of erythropoietin as a result of chronic hypoxemia. Other causes of secondary acquired erythrocytosis include cardiac disease or high altitude, hypoxia in the kidney such as in renal artery stenosis, and tumours secreting erythropoietin, e.g. renal cell cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, and cerebellar haemangioblastoma.

In COPD, 20% of the patients are estimated to have erythrocytosis. Erythrocytosis is attributed to the imbalance between hypoxia-induced erythropoiesis stimulation and inflammation-induced erythropoiesis depression. It results in a high level of red blood cells, together with associated complications such as pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary embolism. Patients with COPD have a worse prognosis when their mean pulmonary arterial pressure is roughly 19 mm Hg or more.

Erythrocytosis is greatly complicated by the underlying conditions in patients with COPD, such as endothelial dysfunction, coagulopathy, hypoxic vasoconstriction, emphysema-induced loss of the pulmonary capillary bed, and smoking-induced inflammatory infiltration.

Objectives

Our study aimed to determine the proportions of COPD and erythrocytosis among COPD patients attending the outpatient department at Fort Portal Regional Referral Hospital.

### Polycythemia vera: rapid evidence review [^1177Jv8R]. American Family Physician (2021). Medium credibility.

Polycythemia vera is one of three stem-cell-derived myeloid malignancies commonly known as myeloproliferative neoplasms. It is characterized by erythrocytosis, often with associated leukocytosis and thrombocytosis. It has a significant negative impact on overall mortality and morbidity in the form of arterial and venous clots, symptoms of fatigue and pruritus, and conversion to leukemia and myelofibrosis. The World Health Organization's major diagnostic criteria include an elevated hemoglobin or hematocrit level, abnormal results on bone marrow biopsy, and presence of the Janus kinase 2 genetic mutation, which is present in approximately 98% of cases. The only minor criterion is a subnormal erythropoietin level, which helps differentiate polycythemia vera from common causes of secondary erythrocytosis such as smoking, sleep apnea, and testosterone use. First-line treatments, such as low-dose aspirin and goal-directed phlebotomy to a hematocrit level of less than 45% to reduce thrombotic events, improve quality of life and prolong survival. When indicated, cytoreductive therapy, primarily with hydroxyurea, can be added with consideration of second-line agents such as pegylated interferon-alfa, busulfan, and ruxolitinib, depending on the clinical scenario. Smoking cessation and cardiometabolic disease are modifiable risk factors that should be addressed to reduce the risk of thrombosis. Currently, no medications have been shown to cure the disease or to reduce the risk of conversion to leukemia and myelofibrosis.

### JAK2 unmutated erythrocytosis: 2023 update on diagnosis and management [^113F3KVi]. American Journal of Hematology (2023). Medium credibility.

Disease Overview

JAK2 unmutated or non-polycythemia vera (PV) erythrocytosis encompasses a heterogenous spectrum of hereditary and acquired entities.

Diagnosis

Foremost in the evaluation of erythrocytosis is the exclusion of PV through JAK2 (inclusive of exons 12–15) mutation screening. Initial assessment should also include gathering of previous records on hematocrit (Hct) and hemoglobin (Hgb) levels, in order to streamline the diagnostic process by first distinguishing longstanding from acquired erythrocytosis; subsequent subcategorization is facilitated by serum erythropoietin (Epo) measurement, germline mutation screening, and review of historical data, including comorbid conditions and medication list. Hereditary erythrocytosis constitutes the main culprit in the context of longstanding erythrocytosis, especially when associated with a positive family history. In this regard, a subnormal serum Epo level suggests EPO receptor mutation. Otherwise, considerations include those associated with decreased (high oxygen affinity Hgb variants, 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate deficiency, PIEZO1 mutations, methemoglobinemia) or normal oxygen tension at 50% Hgb saturation (P50). The latter include germline oxygen sensing pathway (HIF2A-PHD2-VHL) and other rare mutations. Acquired erythrocytosis commonly results from central (e.g., cardiopulmonary disease, high-altitude habitat) or peripheral (e.g., renal artery stenosis) hypoxia. Other noteworthy conditions associated with acquired erythrocytosis include Epo-producing tumors (e.g., renal cell carcinoma, cerebral hemangioblastoma) and drugs (e.g., testosterone, erythropoiesis stimulating agents, sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors). Idiopathic erythrocytosis is an ill-defined terminology that presumes the existence of an increased Hgb/Hct level without an identifiable etiology. Such classification often lacks accounting for normal outliers and is marred by truncated diagnostic evaluation.

Management

Current consensus treatment guidelines are not supported by hard evidence and their value is further undermined by limited phenotypic characterization and unfounded concerns for thrombosis. We are of the opinion that cytoreductive therapy and indiscriminate use of phlebotomy should be avoided in the treatment of non-clonal erythrocytosis. However, it is reasonable to consider therapeutic phlebotomy if one were to demonstrate value in symptom control, with frequency determined by symptoms rather than Hct level. In addition, cardiovascular risk optimization and low dose aspirin is often advised.

Future Directions

Advances in molecular hematology might result in better characterization of "idiopathic erythrocytosis" and expansion of the repertoire for germline mutations in hereditary erythrocytosis. Prospective controlled studies are needed to clarify potential pathology from JAK2 unmutated erythrocytosis, as well as to document the therapeutic value of phlebotomy.

### Venesection and resolution of erythrocytosis are not associated with reduced thrombotic risk in secondary and idiopathic polycythaemia: results from a dual centre, 5-year retrospective study [^113ebeSQ]. British Journal of Haematology (2025). Medium credibility.

Secondary polycythaemia is 10 times more common than polycythaemia vera (PV), but evidence to guide its management is very sparse. We report the results of a retrospective audit of diagnosis and management, including 5‐year outcome data, of 206 patients with secondary polycythaemia from two large hospital trusts. Investigation and management varied widely, but therapeutic venesection was not associated with a faster or greater reduction in haematocrit (Hct) after diagnosis, nor was it associated with a lower risk of thrombosis.

Polycythaemia is defined by the British Society for Haematology (BSH) as a persistent haemoglobin (Hb) > 165 g/L or Hct > 0.48 in females and Hb > 185 g/L or Hct > 0.52 in males. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines it less stringently as Hb > 160 g/L or Hct > 48% in females and Hb > 165 g/L or Hct > 49% in males. Secondary causes of polycythaemia include high erythropoietin (EPO) states, such as hypoxic pulmonary disease (HPD), cyanotic congenital heart disease (CHD), EPO‐secreting tumours and the use of anabolic steroids. An apparent polycythaemia can result from reduction in plasma volume due to diuretic use, alcohol excess and possibly sodium/glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors. Congenital polycythaemia has a variety of well‐characterised genetic causes relating to erythropoietin regulation or haemoglobinopathy. Idiopathic polycythaemia was historically a diagnosis of exclusion; however, recent studies have identified germline and somatic genetic causes in some of these patients.

### Diagnosis, management, and outcomes of drug-induced erythrocytosis: a systematic review [^115unD8R]. Blood Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Current guidelines highlight the lack of consensus on the clinical approach to drug-induced erythrocytosis and the need for further clarification of the clinical outcomes in these conditions. Existing literature does not suggest a clear association between drug-induced erythrocytosis and an increased risk of thromboembolic disease, although there is conflicting evidence for testosterone and thromboembolic risk existing independently of testosterone-induced erythrocytosis. We, therefore, conducted a systematic review of the literature on drug-induced erythrocytosis. Our primary objective was to evaluate the latest evidence on the diagnosis, management, and clinical outcomes of drug-induced erythrocytosis to inform a clinical approach to diagnosis and management of these conditions. Secondary objectives included the determination of clinically relevant subtypes, investigations for and management of special populations (including pregnancy and perioperative patients), and outcomes (including thrombosis, bleeding, and mortality) of patients with drug-induced erythrocytosis.

### Novel exon 12 mutations in the HIF2A gene associated with erythrocytosis [^111wWBjZ]. Blood (2008). Low credibility.

Erythrocytosis can arise from deregulation of the erythropoietin (Epo) axis resulting from defects in the oxygen-sensing pathway. Epo synthesis is controlled by the hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) complex, composed of an alpha and a beta subunit. There are 2 main alpha subunits, HIF-1 alpha and HIF-2 alpha. Recently, a HIF-2 alpha Gly537Trp mutation was identified in a family with erythrocytosis. This raises the possibility of HIF2A mutations being associated with other cases of erythrocytosis. We now report a subsequent analysis of HIF2A in a cohort of 75 erythrocytosis patients and identify 4 additional patients with novel heterozygous Met535Val and Gly537Arg mutations. All patients presented at a young age with elevated serum Epo. Mutations at Gly-537 account for 4 of 5 HIF2A mutations associated with erythrocytosis. These findings support the importance of HIF-2 alpha in human Epo regulation and warrant investigation of HIF2A in patients with unexplained erythrocytosis.

Methods

Search strategy

This is a substudy of the systematic review protocol registered with PROSPERO (PROSPERO CRD42024508643). This review and its findings are reported in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis-Protocols (PRISMA-P) guidelines. A PRISMA-P checklist for this protocol is shown in supplemental Table 1. A systematic search was performed in MEDLINE, EMBASE, the CENTRAL Register of Controlled Trials, and Google Scholar, from the date of inception to 22 January 2024. The bibliographies of relevant systematic reviews were also hand-searched for relevant studies. Information sources were limited to peer-reviewed literature. A sample search strategy has been included in supplemental Table 2, which was adapted for each of the aforementioned sources; this strategy encompassed all etiologies of secondary erythrocytosis.

Study selection

Two reviewers (J.L. and C.C.H.) independently reviewed the titles and abstracts of articles; any disagreements were resolved by a third party (J.H.). Randomized controlled trials and nonrandomized studies were included. Single-case reports and case series with N < 5 were excluded. Studies involving participants aged < 18 years and animal studies were excluded. Publication date was restricted to 2005, the year of JAK2 discovery, or later. No restrictions were placed on language. Studies were categorized by etiology of secondary erythrocytosis, and those not relevant to drug-induced erythrocytosis were excluded. COVIDENCE was used to manage search results. For every eligible study, data were extracted by 1 author (J.L.) using an Excel database to manage the extracted data. An expert librarian with expertise in COVIDENCE, literature searches, and data extraction managed and coordinated this process. Data collection forms are available upon request.

Risk of bias

The Cochrane Handbook risk of bias tool was used to assess randomized controlled trials. Case-controlled studies were assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. Two reviewers (J.L. and C.C.H.) independently assessed studies for risk of bias; any disagreements were resolved by a third party (B.C.-Y.). A summary of the assessment of bias for individual studies is included in Table 1.

### Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease burden, grades and erythrocytosis at a tertiary hospital in Western Uganda [^111QjeSV]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the third leading cause of death worldwide among people over 40 years of age, and erythrocytosis is one of the major complications associated with increased mortality among COPD patients. The study aimed to determine the proportion of COPD, associated factors, and the burden of erythrocytosis among COPD participants.

Methods and Materials

A descriptive cross-sectional study design was used. A consecutive sampling technique was used to obtain study participants at the Fort Portal Regional Referral Hospital outpatient clinic. Focused history and physical examination were carried out to select eligible participants. Participants were screened using the COPD population screener for spirometry after consenting to participate. The study enrolled all adults at risk of having COPD based on the COPD population screener and able to undergo spirometry. Spirometry was carried out according to the Global Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease and European Respiratory Society guidelines, and haemoglobin concentration was measured.

Results

One hundred eighty participants were enrolled in the study, most of whom were females. The modal and mean age of participants was 60 years with 139 (77.2%) females and primary as the highest education level 149(82.8%). The proportion of COPD was 25% (45) [95% CI 18.9–32] and highest among females (68.9%) and those aged 60 years and above (70%). The combined COPD assessment tool groups had a proportion of 55.6%, 37.8%, 4.4%, and 2.2% for groups A, B, C, and D, respectively. Age < 50 years was protective against COPD, while for every additional year of smoking, there was an associated 6.5% increased risk compared to the general population. Additionally, the proportion of erythrocytosis among COPD participants was 6.7%.

Conclusions and Recommendations

There was a high proportion of COPD among study participants (25%), with a 6.7% proportion of erythrocytosis. We recommend a complete blood count for every patient in groups C and D of the ABCD COPD GOLD groups.

### Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease burden, grades and erythrocytosis at a tertiary hospital in Western Uganda [^112DkydD]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions and recommendations

There was a high proportion of erythrocytosis, 6.7% among participants with COPD and 100% among those with severe COPD. Hence, a complete blood count should be performed on patients with severe COPD at diagnosis and follow-up. Furthermore, an algorithm should be developed in the management of patients with severe COPD to mitigate against complications associated with erythrocytosis in this group of patients.

### Abnormalities of the erythrocyte membrane [^111yZ35c]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Primary abnormalities of the erythrocyte membrane are characterized by clinical, laboratory, and genetic heterogeneity. Among this group, hereditary spherocytosis patients are more likely to experience symptomatic anemia. Treatment of hereditary spherocytosis with splenectomy is curative in most patients. Growing recognition of the long-term risks of splenectomy has led to re-evaluation of the role of splenectomy. Management guidelines acknowledge these considerations and recommend discussion between health care providers, patient, and family. The hereditary elliptocytosis syndromes are the most common primary disorders of erythrocyte membrane proteins. However, most elliptocytosis patients are asymptomatic and do not require therapy.

### A guideline for the management of specific situations in polycythaemia vera and secondary erythrocytosis: a British Society for Haematology guideline [^115EAabY]. British Journal of Haematology (2019). Medium credibility.

The impact of cytoreduction in MPN with SVT has not been systematically studied. Cytoreduction was used in 40–70% patients across registries and did not uniformly influence recurrence risk. However, abnormally high blood counts due to inadequate cytoreduction were present in over half the patients with recurrent thrombosis (De Stefano et al, 2016b) indicating the need for rigorous clinical monitoring of patients on cytoreduction. Venesection alone is not appropriate to treat PV and cytoreduction should be undertaken in the presence of SVT. Patients with PV‐related SVT are younger and interferon may be suitable as a first line agent, however data on interferon in this group of patients are not yet available. There are no data to guide therapeutic targets of cytoreductive treatment. In particular, whether more aggressive cytoreduction offsets the residual risk of recurrent thrombosis is not known. One strategy is to use standard targets for treatment of PV with an aim to achieving normal Hct, white blood cell (WBC), neutrophil and platelet counts (Barbui et al, 2011). An alternative strategy is to use lower targets, as defined by experts in the ongoing trial of pegylated interferon 2 alpha in MPN including MPN‐SVT aiming for a Hct ≤ 0·42, WBC count between 2 and 8 × 10 9 /l, and platelet count between 100 and 200 × 10 9 /l (Hoffman, 2012). As this study is not yet complete the evidence for the use of these targets is weak. Nevertheless, the fact that these patients do develop thrombosis with normal counts suggests functional thrombogenicity, which may be altered by using disease‐modifying agents to achieve these lower targets. Small doses of cytoreductive agents are often sufficient to achieve therapeutic targets and care must be taken to avoid significant thrombocytopenia in the face of continuing anticoagulation. Treatment with ruxolitinib was found to reduce the volume of spleen in a third of MPN‐SVT patients after 2 years (Pieri et al, 2017).

Complications of treatment include bleeding, especially gastrointestinal haemorrhage and, in particular, variceal haemorrhage (Ageno et al, 2015; De Stefano et al, 2016b). A quarter of major bleeds are intracranial. Other than thrombocytopenia, cytoreduction does not have any impact on bleeding risk. Bleeding risk can be minimized by careful management of oesophageal varices and concurrent use of proton pump inhibitors.

### Advances in understanding the pathogenesis of red cell membrane disorders [^116sZRXD]. British Journal of Haematology (2019). Medium credibility.

Hereditary erythrocyte membrane disorders are caused by mutations in genes encoding various transmembrane or cytoskeletal proteins of red blood cells. The main consequences of these genetic alterations are decreased cell deformability and shortened erythrocyte survival. Red blood cell membrane defects encompass a heterogeneous group of haemolytic anaemias caused by either (i) altered membrane structural organisation (hereditary spherocytosis, hereditary elliptocytosis, hereditary pyropoikilocytosis and Southeast Asian ovalocytosis) or (ii) altered membrane transport function (overhydrated hereditary stomatocytosis, dehydrated hereditary stomatocytosis or xerocytosis, familial pseudohyperkalaemia and cryohydrocytosis). Herein we provide a comprehensive review of the recent literature on the molecular genetics of erythrocyte membrane defects and their reported clinical consequences. We also describe the effect of low-expression genetic variants on the high inter- and intra-familial phenotype variability of erythrocyte structural defects.

### JAK2 unmutated erythrocytosis: current diagnostic approach and therapeutic views [^11798zui]. Leukemia (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Erythrocytosis refers to either a true or apparent increase in hemoglobin (Hgb)/hematocrit (Hct); distinction requires familiarity with sex-, race- and altitude-adjusted normal values, together with an appreciation of extreme normal values that exceed the 95th percentile (2 SD) of reference range and attention to clinical factors associated with plasma volume depletion (relative erythrocytosis). In 2008, the World Health organization (WHO) proposed Hgb and Hct diagnostic thresholds of 18.5 g/dl/52% and 16.5 g/dl/48% in Caucasian males and females, respectively, for investigation of polycythemia vera (PV). However, in 2016, the WHO classification system revised the Hct/Hct thresholds for PV diagnosis to 16.5 g/dL/49% in males and 16 g/dL/48% in females. In a recent large population-based study, the incidence of erythrocytosis ranged from 0.3% to 3.4% based on the application of the WHO 2008 and 2016 criteria, respectively; importantly increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality was reported only in the context of a higher Hgb threshold (WHO 2008).

The diagnostic workup of JAK2 unmutated erythrocytosis lacks uniformity, and often includes investigations for rare hereditary conditions and several acquired entities known to be associated with secondary erythrocytosis. In a substantial proportion (up to 70%) of patients, despite extensive testing, erythrocytosis remains uncharacterized and sometimes labeled as "idiopathic", which is often a diagnosis of exclusion. The complexity and variability of the decision-making processes involved in managing erythrocytosis were underscored by an international survey of 134 myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) physicians evaluating standard practice in erythrocytosis; in this regard, while first-line assessments were relatively consistent (JAK2, EPO testing), second-line investigations were markedly heterogeneous. Equally variable were treatment practices, including the decision to initiate daily aspirin therapy and/or phlebotomy, as well as the desired Hct target, ranging from 48–56%. Some of this variability in management stems from unsubstantiated concern regarding thrombosis risk. The particular issue was further highlighted in a recent retrospective study where as many as one-third of patients with secondary erythrocytosis were subjected to bone marrow examination and 42% to periodic phlebotomy. Herein, we outline our systematic diagnostic and therapeutic approach in JAK2 unmutated erythrocytosis; our review also includes illustrative cases and a discussion on underlying pathogenetic mechanisms.

Dear Editor,

Erythrocytosis is a common condition and an increasingly frequent reason for consultation in hematology. Since the inception of the 2016 World Health Organization (WHO) 2016 criteria, in lowering the hemoglobin (Hb) and hematocrit (Hct) diagnostic thresholds to 165 g/L and 49% in men, and 160 g/L and 48% in women, respectively, it has been estimated that 4.1% of unselected males (outpatients) have Hb levels exceeding these values. With only a minority of these having polycythemia vera (PV), hematologists are witnessing a new preponderance of referrals for secondary erythrocytosis (SE) which has yielded novel and significant diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. While the classic coupling of JAK2 –positive/subnormal serum erythropoietin (Epo) greatly increases the likelihood of PV diagnosis, those not strictly fulfilling these criteria represent a heterogeneous population for whom a systematic approach has been difficult to establish. Though efforts have been made to operationally discriminate between the various forms of erythrocytosis, data comparatively assessing SE and PV populations are scarce. These support different clinical profiles, while reports of outcomes, including thrombosis, have been inconsistent. Furthermore, little information exists on how these populations are managed in a real world setting, and it may be speculated that SE cohorts are subject either to under or over investigating and treatment. We conducted a direct comparison of clinical and laboratory features, outcomes, diagnostic workup, and treatment patterns in cohorts with SE vs WHO-defined PV.

### Congenital polycythemias / erythrocytoses [^1128FsYu]. Haematologica (2005). Low credibility.

Congenital polycythemias may result from inherited defects in hypoxia sensing, from inherited intrinsic defects in red blood cell precursors, or from inherited conditions that cause low tissue oxygen tension and secondary polycythemia. Conditions of defective hypoxia sensing feature inappropriately normal or elevated serum erythropoietin (Epo) concentrations in the setting of normoxia and erythrocytosis. They are often due to homozygous or compound heterozygous germline mutations in the von Hippel Lindau tumor suppressor gene (VHL) but without increased incidence of tumors. Affected persons have a high risk of arterial thrombosis and early mortality. The molecular biology of rare polycythemic patients with a single mutated VHL allele remains obscure. Primary congenital and familial polycythemias are characterized by low Epo levels and increased erythroid precursor responsiveness to Epo. They are often due to heterozygous gain-of function mutations in the gene for erythropoietin receptor (EPOR). Secondary congenital polycythemias have low tissue oxygen tension due to hemoglobins with high affinity for oxygen, low erythrocyte 2,3 biphosphoglycerate levels, methemoglobinemia or cyanotic heart or lung disease. Whether phlebotomy therapy reduces complications and prolongs survival in congenital polycythemia is not known.

Association between erythrocytosis and CVD risks

Compared to the reference period of non-SGLT2i use without erythrocytosis, erythrocytosis in non-SGLT2i users did not have higher risk of CVD (Fig. 5 and Additional file 1: Table S6). On the other hand, SGLT2i use was associated with risk reduction of composite CVD, CHD and HHF. Among SGLT2i users who developed erythrocytosis, a reduction in the risk of HHF (IRR = 0.38, p = 0.049) was observed comparing to SGLT2i users who did not develop erythrocytosis. In the sensitivity analysis of the haemoglobin threshold for SGLT2i-associated cardiovascular benefits, we noted that reduction in the risk of HHF was still present (IRR = 0.33, p = 0.036) when haemoglobin was within 1.0 g/dL above the sex-specific cut-off, but not when the haemoglobin level was elevated beyond that (Additional file 1: Table S7).

The incidence rate ratio of cardiovascular outcomes between periods of (i) SGLT2i exposure with erythrocytosis; (ii) SGLT2i exposure without erythrocytosis; (iii) absence of SGLT2i exposure with erythrocytosis; and (iv) absence of SGLT2i exposure without erythrocytosis, were estimated using conditional Poisson regression model with an offset for the length of the risk period, with adjustment of time-varying factors (age and the use of other anti-diabetic agents [sulfonylureas, thiazolidinediones, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors, GLP1 receptor agonists, and insulin])

### Testosterone therapy in men with hypogonadism: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^112pqX6G]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). Medium credibility.

Testosterone therapy — erythrocytosis risk and management: Testosterone (T) administration increases hemoglobin and hematocrit and can cause erythrocytosis (hematocrit > 54%) in some men with hypogonadism, with higher frequency in older men; a commissioned meta-analysis showed a significantly higher frequency of erythrocytosis vs placebo. The hematocrit level at which neuro-occlusive or cardiovascular events increase is not known, and the frequency of neuro-occlusive events in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of T who developed erythrocytosis has been very low. Clinicians should evaluate men who develop erythrocytosis during T‑replacement therapy and withhold T therapy until hematocrit has returned to the normal range and then resume T therapy at a lower dose; using therapeutic phlebotomy to lower hematocrit is also effective in managing T treatment–induced erythrocytosis.

### Canagliflozin may increase thromboembolic events in males with erythrocytosis but not in females [^116GWY1N]. Blood Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study demonstrated that canagliflozin increased hematocrit levels regardless of initial values even in patients with erythrocytosis compared with placebo. In addition, canagliflozin increased the prevalence of erythrocytosis from 5.6% to 16.9% and from 1.9% to 5.2% in males and females over 1 year, respectively. Although canagliflozin had a neutral effect on the primary composite outcome (MI, stroke, or any thromboembolism), a significant effect modification by baseline hematocrit levels was observed in men, indicating that canagliflozin provided benefits for anemic male patients but posed potential risks for those with elevated hematocrit levels, whereas no heterogeneity was observed in female patients. The observed heterogeneity in males was primarily driven by MI.

A meta-analysis of 40 randomized clinical trials revealed that SGLT2is significantly increased hematocrit levels by 2.7% compared with placebo. Although SGLT2is have been documented to elevate hematocrit in individuals with low and normal levels, its effect on patients with erythrocytosis has not been verified. Our study extends these findings by demonstrating that SGLT2is significantly increased hematocrit levels in patients with erythrocytosis, regardless of sex. Erythrocytosis predominantly occurs in males, with its prevalence varying depending on the target population and the definition used. Although the prevalence of erythrocytosis in individuals with T2DM is not well established, the baseline prevalence in this study was compatible with that of a recent population-based cohort study from the Netherlands (n = 147 167), which reported erythrocytosis in 7.6% of males and 0.4% of females using the same criteria. Notably, canagliflozin significantly increased the proportion of erythrocytosis in both sexes. It is important to recognize that SGLT2is are potent hematopoietic agents that can improve anemic conditions, increase the prevalence of erythrocytosis, and exacerbate preexisting erythrocytosis.

### Erythrocytosis is associated with intradialytic hypotension: a case series [^116cQMFP]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Erythrocytosis is rare in the context of end stage renal disease (ESRD). The most common erythropoietin (EPO)-dependent etiologies of erythrocytosis include malignancies, chronic hypoxia and obstructive sleep apnea, while myeloproliferative disorders account for most cases of EPO-independent erythrocytosis. However, in many instances, the mechanism of erythrocytosis in ESRD patients is unknown. Renal EPO production is stimulated by decreased oxygen carrying capacity (hemoglobin concentration x O 2 saturation x cardiac output). Because the ability to secrete EPO is diminished in chronic kidney diseases, most ESRD patients require erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESA) to prevent anemia. We describe five ESA-independent patients with ESRD and erythrocytosis, and associated chronic intermittent hypotension, in accordance with established case report guidelines.

### JAK2 unmutated erythrocytosis: current diagnostic approach and therapeutic views [^114q47Rx]. Leukemia (2021). Medium credibility.

JAK2 unmutated or non-polycythemia vera (PV) erythrocytosis encompasses both hereditary and acquired conditions. A systematic diagnostic approach begins with documentation of historical hematocrit (Hct)/hemoglobin (Hgb) measurements and classification of the process as life-long/unknown duration or acquired. Further investigation in both categories is facilitated by determination of serum erythropoietin level (EPO). Workup for hereditary/congenital erythrocytosis requires documentation of family history and laboratory screening for high-oxygen affinity hemoglobin variants, 2, 3 biphosphoglycerate deficiency, and germline mutations that are known to alter cellular oxygen sensing (e.g. PHD2, HIF2A, VHL) or EPO signaling (e.g. EPOR mutations); the latter is uniquely associated with subnormal EPO. Acquired erythrocytosis is often elicited by central or peripheral hypoxia resulting from cardiopulmonary disease/high-altitude dwelling or renal artery stenosis, respectively; EPO in the former instance is often normal (compensated by negative feed-back). Other conditions associated with acquired erythrocytosis include EPO-producing tumors and the use of drugs that promote erythropoiesis (e.g., testosterone, erythropoiesis stimulating agents). "Idiopathic erythrocytosis" loosely refers to an otherwise not explained situation. Historically, management of non-PV erythrocytosis has been conflicted by unfounded concerns regarding thrombosis risk, stemming from limited phenotypic characterization, save for Chuvash polycythemia, well-known for its thrombotic tendency. In general, cytoreductive therapy should be avoided and phlebotomy is seldom warranted where frequency is determined by symptom control rather than Hct threshold. Although not supported by hard evidence, cardiovascular risk optimization and low-dose aspirin use are often advised. Application of modern genetic tests and development of controlled therapeutic intervention trials are needed to advance current clinical practice.

### Ineffective erythropoiesis: anemia and iron overload [^111s9TaP]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Stress erythropoiesis (SE) is characterized by an imbalance in erythroid proliferation and differentiation under increased demands of erythrocyte generation and tissue oxygenation. β-thalassemia represents a chronic state of SE, called ineffective erythropoiesis (IE), exhibiting an expansion of erythroid-progenitor pool and deposition of alpha chains on erythrocyte membranes, causing cell death and anemia. Concurrently, there is a decrease in hepcidin expression and a subsequent state of iron overload. There are substantial investigative efforts to target increased iron absorption under IE. There are also avenues for targeting cell contact and signaling within erythroblastic islands under SE, for therapeutic benefits.

### Increased blood reactive oxygen species and hepcidin in obstructive sleep apnea precludes expected erythrocytosis [^116PdNtQ]. American Journal of Hematology (2023). Medium credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) causes intermittent hypoxia during sleep. Hypoxia predictably initiates an increase in the blood hemoglobin concentration (Hb); yet in our analysis of 527 patients with OSA, > 98% did not have an elevated Hb. To understand why patients with OSA do not develop secondary erythrocytosis due to intermittent hypoxia, we first hypothesized that erythrocytosis occurs in these patients, but is masked by a concomitant increase in plasma volume. However, we excluded that explanation by finding that the red cell mass was normal (measured by radionuclide labeling of erythrocytes and carbon monoxide inhalation). We next studied 45 patients with OSA before and after applying continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). We found accelerated erythropoiesis in these patients (increased erythropoietin and reticulocytosis), but it was offset by neocytolysis (lysis of erythrocytes newly generated in hypoxia upon return to normoxia). Parameters of neocytolysis included increased reactive oxygen species from expanded reticulocytes' mitochondria. The antioxidant catalase was also downregulated in these cells from hypoxia-stimulated microRNA-21. In addition, inflammation-induced hepcidin limited iron availability for erythropoiesis. After CPAP, some of these intermediaries diminished but Hb did not change. We conclude that in OSA, the absence of significant increase in red cell mass is integral to the pathogenesis, and results from hemolysis via neocytolysis combined with inflammation-mediated suppression of erythropoiesis.

### Classification and molecular biology of polycythemias (erythrocytoses) and thrombocytosis [^115FS2K1]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

In this article, polycythemic disorders are classified based on the current understanding of biology of erythropoieses and divided into primary and secondary polycythemias. Special emphasis is given to recently uncovered molecular bases of newly described congenital polycythemic disorders. This clarification of the pathophysiology of some of the congenital polycythemic states has obvious utility for more accurate diagnosis and rational prognostic determination. The molecular basis of congenital thrombocytoses is only beginning to be uncovered. In contrast, the molecular bases of polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia remain unknown, thus their diagnostic criteria are imprecise and their treatment remains largely empirical. The central premise of this article is that deciphering the molecular basis of human diseases leads to improved understanding of hematopoiesis, precise diagnosis, and the potential for development of a specific therapy.

### Idiopathic erythrocytosis in dialysis patients: a case report and literature review [^1151GRWF]. American Journal of Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

Anemia is a common complication in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients. On the other hand, idiopathic erythrocytosis is extremely rare, with only a few cases reported in the literature. We present a case of erythrocytosis that developed after initiating hemodialysis. A 68-year-old male with a history of ESRD secondary to diabetes presented with erythrocytosis that started a few months after initiating dialysis in the absence of having received erythropoietin-stimulating agents or iron supplements. His erythropoietin level was elevated, with a negative JAK2 mutation. Blood gases showed normal oxygen and CO(2), with slightly elevated carboxyhemoglobin. Tiny foci in both kidneys were noted, representing vascular calcifications or renolithiasis. There was no radiological evidence of neoplasms or cysts. After excluding secondary causes, a diagnosis of idiopathic erythrocytosis was made. The patient underwent intermittent phlebotomies during dialysis, and his hemoglobin went from 18.5 to 14 mg/dl. Erythrocytosis in ESRD patients is very rare. So far, there is no complete understanding of the underlying pathophysiology; however, there seem to be multiple possible reasons for an increased erythropoietin level. Phlebotomy is a successful and easy way to control erythrocytosis in such patients. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, currently being used in posttransplant erythrocytosis, might also be considered.

### Novel potential therapeutics to modify iron metabolism and red cell synthesis in diseases associated with defective erythropoiesis [^1149yHTv]. Haematologica (2023). Medium credibility.

Under normal conditions, iron metabolism is carefully regulated to sustain normal cellular functions and the production of hemoglobin in erythroid cells. Perturbation to the erythropoiesis-iron metabolism axis can result in iron imbalances and cause anemia or organ toxicity. Various congenital and acquired diseases associated with abnormal red cell production are characterized by aberrant iron absorption. Several recent studies have shown that improvements in red blood cell production also ameliorate iron metabolism and vice versa. Many therapeutics are now under development with the potential to improve a variety of hematologic diseases, from β-thalassemia and iron-refractory iron deficiency anemia to anemia of inflammation and polycythemia vera. This review summarizes selected mechanisms related to red cell production and iron metabolism and describes potential therapeutics and their current uses. We also consider the potential application of the discussed therapeutics on various diseases, alone or in combination. The vast repertoire of drugs under development offers new opportunities to improve the clinical care of patients suffering from congenital or acquired red blood cell disorders with limited or no treatment options.

### Low incidence ofmutations in idiopathic erythrocytosis [^1117BKt4]. Haematologica (2021). Medium credibility.

Erythrocytosis and polycythemia are common terms referring to the increase of hematocrit (Ht) and hemoglobin (Hb) concentrations. However, to ensure a diagnosis of true erythrocytosis, certain criteria must be met. Testing must reveal a red cell mass (RCM) > 125%or Ht > 56% in women or > 60% in men.

Primary erythrocytosis is caused by an intrinsic abnormal proliferation of the erythroid compartment. The most common is PV, the diagnosis of which is well standardized according to the 2016 World Health Organization (WHO) criteria, which includes the JAK2 mutations, found in 98% of cases. Erythrocytosis can also result from an acquired abnormality that stimulates erythropoietin (EPO) secretion, resulting in secondary polycythemias. Increased secretion of EPO can arise from hypoxia pathway activation, often observed in heart or lung diseases, and also from ectopic secretion of EPO by tumors. Congenital secondary erythrocytosis results, among others, from hemoglobin with high oxygen affinity due to α, b or γ globin mutations, or from a very rare mutation in the bisphosphoglycerate mutase (BPGM) coding gene that causes 2,3-BPG levels to decrease. Yet many cases of polycythemia remain idiopathic because the most common causes are not identified. Since the advent of molecular biology and next-generation sequencing (NGS), the genes involved in the regulation of the hypoxia sensing pathway (PHD2/EGLN1, HIF2A/EPAS1, VHL, EPO) or in proliferation and differentiation of erythroid progenitors (JAK2 or the EPO receptor gene [EPOR]) are more easily identified and their pathological pathways can be clarified. As recently reviewed, new mutations in the HIF/EPO pathway have been reported in the last few years, underscoring the rapid evolution of current knowledge on the causes of erythrocytosis. For example, we recently demonstrated that exon skipping and cryptic exon retention were new VHL alterations and revealed a novel complex splicing regulation of the VHL gene.

### Idiopathic erythrocytosis: a diagnostic and management challenge with emerging areas for exploration [^1161c2nN]. British Journal of Haematology (2024). Medium credibility.

Despite published algorithms for approaching the work-up of erythrocytosis, a significant proportion of patients are left with uncertainty as to its aetiology and prognosis. The term 'idiopathic erythrocytosis' (IE) is applied when known primary and secondary aetiologies have been ruled out. However, the assignment of secondary aetiologies is not always straightforward or evidence based, which can lead to misdiagnosis and heterogeneity in cohort studies. Furthermore, new studies have identified germline or somatic mutations that may affect prognosis. Epidemiological and cohort data are inconsistent as to whether IE increases the risk for complications such as arterial and venous thromboembolism, clonal transformation or comorbid conditions. Randomized trials assessing the role of phlebotomy for long-term management of IE have not been performed, so treatment remains a vexing problem for clinicians. Standardization of terminology and testing strategies, including comprehensive genetic screening in clinical research, are key to refining our understanding of IE.

Introduction

Polycythemia and erythrocytosis

There are several different parameters for diagnosis of polycythemia and erythrocytosis based on a blood count: the number of red blood cells, the hematocrit, and the hemoglobin concentration. Elevations in these measures can occur on a primary or secondary basis (Table 1). Primary polycythemia results from functional abnormalities intrinsic to erythroid progenitors, causing them to be hypersensitive to or independent of erythropoietin. This category includes polycythemia vera (PV), which is associated with acquired somatic mutations in the Janus kinase 2 gene (JAK2), dominantly inherited primary familial and congenital polycythemia or erythrocytosis, caused by germline gain-of-function erythropoietin receptor (EPOR) mutations, and erythrocytosis due to SH2B3 mutations. Primary familial and congenital polycythemia or erythrocytosis predisposes patients to cardiovascular disorders, perhaps due to chronic augmented erythropoietin signaling in all tissues bearing EPOR. In contrast, in secondary erythrocytosis, functionally normal erythroid progenitors are exposed to increased levels of circulating erythropoiesis-stimulating factors. In most instances, the erythropoiesis-stimulating factor is erythropoietin, but cobalt, insulin growth factor 1, increased angiotensin signaling and manganese may also stimulate erythropoiesis.

Table 1.
Classification of polycythemia and erythrocytosis.

Acquired causes of secondary erythrocytosis include erythrocytosis of pulmonary disease, high altitude erythrocytosis, Eisenmenger syndrome, smoking, carboxyhemoglobinemia, erythropoietin-producing tumors, doping with erythropoietin, post- renal transplant erythrocytosis, exogenous testosterone use, and cobalt and manganese toxicities. Congenital secondary erythrocytosis can be caused by high oxygen affinity hemoglobin variants, inherited low 2,3-diphosphoglycerate leading to high hemoglobin oxygen affinity, congenital methemoglobinemia, and a recently described gain-of-function mutation of the gene encoding erythropoietin (EPO). Other congenital conditions include rare germline mutations in hypoxia sensing pathway genes, including loss of function mutations of VHL encoding von Hippel Lindau (VHL) protein and EGLN1 encoding prolyl hydroxylase 2 (PHD2), and gain-of-function mutations of EPAS1 encoding hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-2α.

### Dysregulated iron metabolism in polycythemia vera: etiology and consequences [^112UkWJS]. Leukemia (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocytosis (ET), and primary myelofibrosis (MF) are the classical BCR-ABL negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs). These blood cancers represent a heterogeneous group of clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorders with constitutively activated physiologic signal-transduction pathways. PV is characterized by erythrocytosis, bone marrow erythroid and megakaryocytic hyperplasia, fatigue, aquagenic pruritus, microvascular symptoms, and symptomatic splenomegaly. Complications of PV include a significantly increased risk of arterial and venous thrombosis (41%) and the potential for evolution to MF (10–20%) and MPN-blast phase (3–10%), significantly reducing survival. Most patients with PV present with iron deficiency at diagnosis, even prior to the onset of therapeutic phlebotomy, the mainstay of treatment. Iron deficiency is often exacerbated by repeated phlebotomies, a desired effect thought to limit the accelerated erythropoiesis by restricting a necessary component of hemoglobin synthesis. This can lead to symptoms such as cognitive impairment and fatigue, even in the absence of anemia. Recent studies demonstrate that available therapies might improve PV-related symptoms in part by reversing iron deficiency. The genesis of iron deficiency in PV and its effect on disease manifestations and natural history have been explored to a limited extent. In this review, we focus on what is known about iron metabolism and erythropoiesis in PV. In addition, we build on recent advances in understanding the regulation of iron metabolism to enhance our understanding of PV pathophysiology and ultimately propose alternative therapeutic options.

### How I treat polycythemia vera [^116UaRBV]. Blood (2019). Medium credibility.

Since its discovery, polycythemia vera (PV) has challenged clinicians responsible for its diagnosis and management and scientists investigating its pathogenesis. As a clonal hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) disorder, PV is a neoplasm but its driver mutations result in overproduction of morphologically and functionally normal blood cells. PV arises in an HSC but it can present initially as isolated erythrocytosis, leukocytosis, thrombocytosis, or any combination of these together with splenomegaly or myelofibrosis, and it can take years for a true panmyelopathy to appear. PV shares the same JAK2 mutation as essential thrombocytosis and primary myelofibrosis, but erythrocytosis only occurs in PV. However, unlike secondary causes of erythrocytosis, in PV, the plasma volume is frequently expanded, masking the erythrocytosis and making diagnosis difficult if this essential fact is ignored. PV is not a monolithic disorder: female patients deregulate fewer genes and clinically behave differently than their male counterparts, while some PV patients are genetically predisposed to an aggressive clinical course. Nevertheless, based on what we have learned over the past century, most PV patients can lead long and productive lives. In this review, using clinical examples, I describe how I diagnose and manage PV in an evidence-based manner without relying on chemotherapy.

### Acquired disorders… [^1175Yvtj]. AAFP (2004). Low credibility.

Hemolysis is the destruction or removal of red blood cells from the circulation before their normal life span of 120 days. While hemolysis can be a lifelong asymptomatic condition, it most often presents as anemia when erythrocytosis cannot match the pace of red cell destruction. Hemolysis also can manifest as jaundice, cholelithiasis, or isolated reticulocytosis. The more common extravascular hemolysis is the removal and destruction of red blood cells with membrane alterations by the macrophages of the spleen and liver. Circulating blood is filtered continuously through thin-walled splenic cords into the splenic sinusoids, a spongelike labyrinth of macrophages with long dendritic processes. Delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions occur three to 10 days after a transfusion and usually are caused by low titer antibodies to minor red blood cell antigens.

On exposure to antigenic blood cells, these antibodies are generated rapidly and cause an extravascular hemolysis. Compared with the acute transfusion reaction, the onset and progression are more gradual.
14. Septicemia caused by Clostridium perfringens, which occurs in intra-abdominal infections and septic abortions, causes hemolysis when the bacterium releases alpha toxin, a phospholipase that degrades the red blood cell membrane. The altered erythrocytes undergo both intravascular and extravascular destruction. Older red blood cells are most susceptible, because they have an intrinsic G6PD deficiency coupled with the normal age-related decline in G6PD levels. Hemolysis occurs two to four days following exposure and varies from an asymptomatic decline in hemoglobin to a marked intravascular hemolysis. Even with ongoing exposure, the hemolysis usually is self-limited, as the older G6PD-deficient cells are destroyed.

There is no specific therapy other than treatment of the underlying infection and avoidance of implicated medications. In cases of severe hemolysis, which can occur with the Mediterranean-variant enzyme, transfusion may be required. Although there is marked variability in phenotype, hereditary spherocytosis is typically a chronically compensated, mild to moderate hemolytic anemia. The diagnosis is based on the combination of spherocytosis noted on peripheral smear, a family history, and a negative DAT. The mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration frequently is elevated.

### Why does my patient have erythrocytosis? [^112puSuY]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Primary polycythemias are the result of intrinsic abnormalities of the hematopoietic progenitors that lead to constitutive overproduction of red cells accompanied by low erythropoietin (EPO) levels. Secondary polycythemias are caused by conditions resulting in increased EPO production. Polycythemia vera (PV) is a primary polycythemia, and is a chronic clonal progressive myeloproliferative neoplasm. A single recurrent point mutation in the pseudokinase domain of JAK2 molecule (JAK2(V617F)) is present in > 95% of patients with PV. The goal of therapy in PV is to normalize blood counts to minimize the risk of thrombotic events.

Results

Diagnosis and genetic screening

Patients with erythrocytosis were selected after exclusion of classical causes of erythrocytosis (polycythemia vera or secondary erythrocytosis associated with particular renal, cardiac or pulmonary disorders). Genetic screening was performed by using next-generation sequencing (NGS) panels dedicated to erythrocytosis, and a total of 1,450 patients were sequenced at all centers. Results are presented in Table 1 and show 33 missense genetic variants identified in a total of 43 patients (41 patients with heterozygous germline variant and 2 patients with mosaicism) and 28 relatives from four different European countries. Ten variants have already been described. Twenty-four variants are located in exon 12 and extend from amino acids 525 to 658 surrounding the key proline in position 531. Family history of erythrocytosis is present in 14 families. The pedigrees are of variable size (Figure 1; Online Supplementary Figure S1) and can show a multigenerational history of erythrocytosis (family [F] 14, F22), but sometimes also display a family history related to the consequences of undiagnosed erythrocytosis, such as ischemic stroke (F13). Clinical manifestations are in general variable, ranging from mild to severe erythrocytosis (Ht up to 77.5% in patient 19) (Table 1 for probands; Online Supplementary Table S3 for relatives). The serum EPO level is rarely elevated except in two patients (up to 7,500 UI/mL in patient 20). However, we were unable to obtain full information on the patient's phlebothomy time frame that may influence these factors.

### Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease burden, grades and erythrocytosis at a tertiary hospital in Western Uganda [^112EToM1]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Erythrocytosis was found in 6.7% [95% CI 1.4–18.3] of the 45 COPD participants. The findings were similar to those of a study in China in which 886 COPD patients were assessed for erythrocytosis, with a prevalence of 6.4%. However, a study carried out in Pakistan had a higher prevalence of 10.8%, but the study findings were higher than those observed in Egypt (2.4%). The differences in prevalence may be due to differences in the inclusion criteria used by these studies and the risk factors supporting the development of erythrocytosis. The progression of erythrocytosis may be multifactorial and thus needs to be studied in various populations. Male sex, current smoking, poor carbon monoxide diffusing capacity (DLCO), and severe hypoxemia are all linked to an elevated risk for secondary erythrocytosis. However, erythrocytosis among COPD patients increases the likelihood of acute respiratory failure, pulmonary embolism (PE), and death.

Areas requiring further investigation

It is currently unknown which patients are at higher risk of drug-induced erythrocytosis or require more extensive investigations such as bone marrow biopsy or molecular testing. The development of a predictive model or scoring system may help clarify this. Further studies for prospective validation would also be beneficial to determine thromboembolic risk associated with drug-induced erythrocytosis, to establish whether antiplatelet agents or phlebotomy have a role in mitigating this risk, and to clarify long-term follow-up in this heterogeneous patient population.

### The complete evaluation of erythrocytosis: congenital and acquired [^1172nQUo]. Leukemia (2009). Low credibility.

The approach to a patient with erythrocytosis is greatly simplified by assessing the clonality of the process upfront. In this regard, there has been a dramatic shift toward genetic testing and away from traditional tests, such as measurement of red cell mass. Clonal erythrocytosis is the diagnostic feature of polycythemia vera (PV) and is almost always associated with a JAK2 mutation (JAK2V617F or exon 12). All other scenarios represent non-clonal erythrocytosis, often referred to as secondary erythrocytosis. Serum erythropoietin (Epo) level is usually normal or elevated in secondary erythrocytosis and subnormal in PV. Therefore, in a patient with acquired erythrocytosis, it is reasonable to begin the diagnostic work-up with peripheral blood JAK2 mutation analysis and serum Epo measurement to distinguish PV from secondary erythrocytosis. Conversely, the patient with life-long erythrocytosis is more likely to suffer from congenital polycythemia and should therefore be evaluated for germline mutations that result in enhanced Epo effect (for example, Epo receptor mutations), altered intracellular oxygen sensing (for example, mutations involving the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor gene) or decreased P50 (for example, high-oxygen-affinity hemoglobinopathy). The order of tests in this instance depends on the clinical scenario and serum Epo level.

### Idiopathic erythrocytosis: a disappearing entity [^1148rerc]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2009). Low credibility.

Erythrocytosis results when there is an increased red cell mass and thus an increased hemoglobin. The causes can be divided into primary intrinsic defects of the erythroid progenitor cell and secondary defects, where factors external to the erythroid compartment are responsible. Both can then be further divided into congenital and acquired categories. Congenital causes include mutations of the erythropoietin receptor and defects of the oxygen-sensing pathway including VHL, PHD2 and HIF2A mutations. When fully investigated there remain a number of patients in whom no cause can be elucidated who are currently described as having idiopathic erythrocytosis. Investigation should start with a full history and examination. Having eliminated the common entity polycythemia vera, further direction for investigation is guided by the erythropoietin level. Clinical consequences of the various erythrocytoses are not clear, but in some groups thromboembolic events have been described in young patients. Evidence is lacking to define best management, but aspirin and venesection to a target hematocrit should be considered.

Congenital erythrocytosis

Germ‐line defects can result in a congenital erythrocytosis, which is usually diagnosed in children or young adults, often in those with a family history of erythrocytosis. A wide range of defects have been described leading to primary and secondary erythrocytosis including high oxygen affinity haemoglobins (Bento et al, 2014; Camps et al, 2016).

These conditions are rare and clinical events and outcomes are poorly described. In Chuvash polycythaemia, where affected individuals have a homozygous mutation in the VHL gene increased thrombotic complications have been reported (Sergueeva et al, 2017). Major thrombotic events have also been reported to occur in young individuals with other types of congenital erythrocytosis (Bento et al, 2014). There are also reports of increased pulmonary artery pressure in both Chuvash polycythaemia and other congenital erythrocytosis (Bushuev et al, 2006; Smith et al, 2006). Recently, somatic gain‐of‐function mutations in EPAS1 (HIF2A) have been associated with neuroendocrine tumours in the presence of erythrocytosis (Zhuang et al, 2012) and, therefore, it may be advised to screen for these events in individuals with known mutations.

### Re-evaluation of hematocrit as a determinant of thrombotic risk in erythrocytosis [^111249Gw]. Haematologica (2019). Medium credibility.

Here we critically evaluate the role of elevated hematocrit as the principal determinant of thrombotic risk in polycythemia and erythrocytosis, defined by an expansion of red cell mass. Since red cell volume determination is no longer readily available, in clinical practice, polycythemia and erythrocytosis are defined by elevated hemoglobin and hematocrit. Thrombosis is common in Chuvash erythrocytosis and polycythemia vera. Although the increased thrombotic risk is assumed to be due to the elevated hematocrit and an associated increase in blood viscosity, thrombosis does not accompany most types of erythrocytosis. We review studies indicating that the occurrence of thrombosis in Chuvash erythrocytosis is independent of hematocrit, that the thrombotic risk is paradoxically increased by phlebotomy in Chuvash erythrocytosis, and that, when compared to chemotherapy, phlebotomy is associated with increased thrombotic risk in polycythemia vera. Inherited and environmental causes that lead to polycythemia and erythrocytosis are accompanied by diverse cellular changes that could directly affect thrombotic risk, irrespective of the elevated hematocrit. The pressing issue in these disorders is to define factors other than elevated hematocrit that determine thrombotic risk. Defining these predisposing factors in polycythemia and erythrocytosis should then lead to rational therapies and facilitate development of targeted interventions.

Nonprescription androgen use

One prospective cohort studyinvestigated nonprescription use of androgen in a group of 100 men. The exact dose of androgen was unknown and varied among participants based on label information. A mean increase in hemoglobin by 0.53 g/L and a mean increase in hematocrit by 3% were described over the course of the 1-year study period; there was no association between the degree of erythrocytosis and the duration of androgen cycle, nor was there an association between the degree of erythrocytosis and a higher androgen dose. Erythrocytosis resolved ∼3 months after the end of the androgen cycle. No thromboembolic events were described.

SGLT-2 inhibitors

Empagliflozin, canagliflozin, and dapagliflozin were all described in the literature to have an association with erythrocytosis. Rates of erythrocytosis on SGLT-2 inhibitors ranged from 10% to 22%. One retrospective cohort studyobserved an adjusted mean increase in hemoglobin of 4.3 g/L; other retrospective studies, described a median increase in hemoglobin ranging from 23 to 25 g/L. Individuals who remained on SGLT-2 inhibitors typically demonstrated a plateau in their hemoglobin levels; 1 studyreported that most of the patients who remained on SGLT-2 inhibitors demonstrated normalization or return to baseline of their hemoglobin levels. Up to 26% of patients discontinued their SGLT-2 inhibitors, with subsequent improvement or resolution of erythrocytosis.

### Cardiovascular benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors in type 2 diabetes, interaction with metformin and role of erythrocytosis: a self-controlled case series study [^115Ab9cK]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2022). Medium credibility.

Our study provided useful information on the incidence of SGLT2i-associated erythrocytosis in a population-based cohort — around 3 per 100 person-years. We have also characterised the cardiovascular outcomes of patients who developed SGLT2i-associated erythrocytosis. In contrast to non-SGLT2i-associated polycythaemia that has been associated with increased risks of MACE, SGLT2i-associated erythrocytosis does not appear to attenuate the cardiovascular benefits of SGLT2i, hence phlebotomy might not be necessary in this case. This may be explained by the fact that SGLT2i activates both SIRT1 and AMPK which are associated with a fasting transcriptional paradigm. This brings about antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, and consequently cardio-protection. Erythrocytosis is only one of the downstream effects from SIRT1 activation. In fact, we even observed a lower risk of HHF in SGLT2i users who developed erythrocytosis compared to SGLT2i users who did not. Our sensitivity analysis of the threshold haemoglobin level for SGLT2i-associated cardiovascular benefits demonstrated that mild erythrocytosis (haemoglobin level elevated within 1.0 g/dL above the sex-specific cut-off) during SGLT2i use was even associated with further cardiovascular benefits in HHF. While our current study did not reveal an increase in cardiovascular risks with even higher haemoglobin, this could likely be due to the relatively small number of events in that subgroup. Taken together, these results could mean that while clinicians should monitor SGLT2i users who develop erythrocytosis and exclude sinister causes such as PV, clinicians could probably tolerate mild SGLT2i-asociated erythrocytosis for its associated cardiovascular benefits. Further systematic assessment of SGLT2i-associated erythrocytosis will shed light on the haemoglobin threshold and the validity of using erythrocytosis as a potential marker of SGLT2i users who may derive cardiovascular benefits.

### Re-evaluation of hematocrit as a determinant of thrombotic risk in erythrocytosis [^117PSu7o]. Haematologica (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Certain disorders with elevated hematocrit, such as PV, CE, primary familial and congenital polycythemia or erythrocytosis (EPOR mutation), and EPAS1 gain-of-function mutations, are associated with thrombotic complications. These conditions are characterized by diverse cellular and metabolic changes that could be directly associated with thrombotic risk, irrespective of hematocrit level. The challenge in these conditions is to elucidate factors for the thrombotic risk other than the elevated hematocrit, and to define what, if any, role that viscosity plays in thrombotic risk. Defining these thrombosis-predisposing factors would provide the basis for identifying and developing novel targeted therapies for these disorders. The evidence we have presented here points to favoring the use of myelosuppressive therapy for intermediate- and high-risk PV, as this approach has been proven to decrease the risk of thrombosis in PV. Furthermore, we trust that the urge to correct any abnormal laboratory data by a therapeutic intervention should be tempered by consideration of the risk-benefit ratio of any such intervention. The routine practice of phlebotomy for elevated hematocrit, with its inevitable iron deficiency (which leads to inhibition of PHD2, increased HIF, and increased erythropoietin) and potential detrimental thrombotic effects, should be re-evaluated. We hope that this review will encourage more studies to pursue the challenge of defining the specific molecular basis of thrombosis in diverse types of polycythemia and erythrocytosis. Improved knowledge of the pathophysiology of these entities should be extended to the development of targeted approaches for the prevention and therapy of thrombotic complications. A review of potential molecular mechanisms contributing to thrombosis in myeloproliferative neoplasms was published at the time of the submission of this manuscript.

### How to manage polycythemia vera [^112DVQRU]. Leukemia (2012). Low credibility.

My diagnostic approach in case of isolated erythrocytosis is based on the visit and the interview of patients, and on checking the causes of secondary erythrocytosis. If causes of secondary erythrocytosis are not evident and serum erythropoietin level is low-normal, I study JAK2 mutations. In the case of a patient with erythrocytosis and other signs of myeloproliferation, such as leukocytosis, thrombocytosis or splenomegaly, the diagnosis of polycythemia vera (PV) is likely, and I test serum erythropoietin and JAK2 mutations first. I stratify patients at diagnosis of PV according to age and history of thrombosis. I start hydroxyurea for patients who are at a high risk of thrombosis (that is, with one or two risk factors), while I continue only phlebotomy in other cases. All PV patients, if not contraindicated, receive aspirin. I follow up patients monthly until normalization of their blood cell counts or splenomegaly, and afterwards every 2 months with visit, cell blood count and blood smear evaluation. After diagnosis, I perform bone marrow biopsy only in the case of clinical signs of disease evolution.

### Hemoglobin and anemia in relation to dementia risk and accompanying changes on brain MRI [^111Fec2C]. Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

In addition to the lower range, we found that high hemoglobin levels were also associated with an increased risk of dementia, extending short-term observations in a prior study to long-term risk in the community. Although studies often focus on anemia and the lower range of hemoglobin levels, high hemoglobin may be deleterious, or reflect deleterious circumstances, in several ways. First, lysis of erythrocytes could cause elevated measurements in the presence of functional anemia and excess of free iron. Second, erythrocytosis occurs secondary to systemic reductions in blood oxygenation, often due to smoking, heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or chronic kidney disease. These are all risk factors for dementia, yet excluding participants with common causes of erythrocytosis from our analysis did not attenuate the risk estimates for high hemoglobin. Third, higher blood viscosity could predispose to ischemia, as typically seen in patients with polycythemia vera. Elevated hematocrit values have been observed in patients with TIA and strokeand covert brain infarcts, and although we found no association of high hemoglobin with infarcts on MRI, the previously reported U-shaped associations of hematocrit with risk of dementia, as well as coronary heart disease and ischemic stroke during long-term follow-up, corroborate the potential relevance of deviations on both sides from the normal range. Further studies are needed to determine whether these findings are for instance attributable to high viscosity, reductions in tissue oxygenation with very high levels of haematocrit, or the higher hematocrit levels in individuals with microangiopathy.

### Erythrocytosis is associated with intradialytic hypotension: a case series [^111HCCNa]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

For patients with end stage renal disease undergoing hemodialysis, erythrocytosis occurs rarely. Erythrocytosis increases the risk of thrombosis, which is a common complication in hemodialysis patients. The risk of thrombosis may also be increased by hypotension. The purpose of our report is to examine the relationship between intradialytic hypotension and erythrocytosis.

Case presentation

We present a series of five patients with end stage renal disease and erythrocytosis (peak hemoglobin range 15.2–18.5 g/dL). All were erythropoiesis-stimulating agent naïve and non-smokers. Prior to developing erythrocytosis, each patient developed recurring episodes of intradialytic hypotension over several months. A statistically significant inverse correlation was observed between nadir intradialytic systolic blood pressure and hemoglobin concentration. In the index case, midodrine treatment resulted in resolution of the hypotension and erythrocytosis. Most of the patients had multiple acquired renal cysts, which is a potential source of erythropoietin. Four of the five cases developed arteriovenous dialysis access or deep venous thrombosis.

Conclusions

An association between intradialytic hypotension and erythrocytosis was observed in five cases. We postulate that chronic intermittent hypotension and renal ischemia may lead to erythropoietin secretion, and this cascade could represent a newly recognized cause of secondary erythrocytosis.

### How can sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors stimulate erythrocytosis in patients who are iron-deficient? Implications for understanding iron homeostasis in heart failure [^1148hnVQ]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2022). Medium credibility.

One of the most striking features of treatment with sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors in heart failure is their effect to increase haemoglobin and haematocrit. The increase in red blood cell production produced by these drugs occurs within the first month of therapy and is triggered by an increase in erythropoietin. The degree of erythrocytosis precedes, predicts and closely parallels the effect of SGLT2 inhibitors to reduce the risk of heart failure events in large‐scale cardiovascular outcome trials. Patients who develop striking erythrocytosis while receiving an SGLT2 inhibitor experience the most marked reduction in heart failure hospitalizations.

### Phenotypical differences and thrombosis rates in secondary erythrocytosis versus polycythemia vera [^112RGFJZ]. Blood Cancer Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Importantly, rates of thromboembolic events, prior to diagnosis, were comparable in both PV and SE populations, suggesting that from the standpoint of thrombosis, SE may not be as benign as some reports have intimated. While post-diagnosis thrombotic rates appeared lower in SE patients, limited follow-up in this cohort precludes accurate interpretation. Furthermore, regardless of erythrocytosis etiology, classic cardiovascular risk factors (age, hypertension, obesity, etc.) significantly clustered with thrombosis risk, emphasizing the importance of controlling these risk factors in PV (in addition to Hct targets) as well as SE patients.

Notably, a third of SE patients underwent bone marrow sampling with patent low-yield, raising the question of how to better discern patients that require this not entirely anodyne intervention. Similarly, from a therapeutic perspective, the fact that a significant proportion of SE patients were exposed to phlebotomy and aspirin, both of which remain controversial in secondary etiologiesand may not be completely innocuous, highlights the need for formal trials of these therapies in SE. Finally, while further studies are needed to more comprehensively address the unmet needs relevant to SE, the current observations call for a reappraisal of workup and management practices, and raise concerns for potentially increased thrombotic complications in this understudied population.

### Evaluation of anemia [^115u8PZ8]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Anemia is a common problem in primary care. Classification based on mean cell volume narrows the differential diagnosis and directs testing. A marked macrocytosis is characteristic of vitamin B12 and folate deficiencies, certain medications, and primary bone marrow disorders. The three most common causes of microcytic anemia are iron deficiency, thalassemia trait, and anemia of inflammation. Additional laboratory testing is required for diagnosis. Determination of the rate of development of anemia and examination of a blood smear may provide diagnostic clues to guide more specialized testing. Diagnosis of iron, vitamin B12, or folate deficiency mandates determination of the underlying cause.

### Erythrocytosis in a large cohort of trans men using testosterone: a long-term follow-up study on prevalence, determinants, and exposure years [^116tuETC]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Current guidelines on the management of secondary erythrocytosis in trans men on testosterone therapy refer to the guideline for testosterone-treated hypogonadal cis men and consider hematocrit levels > 0.50 L/L as potentially dangerous, as it has a very high risk of adverse outcome. This guideline advices a cessation of testosterone therapy, a dose reduction, or therapeutic phlebotomy when hematocrit levels exceed 0.54 L/L to reduce the risk of adverse events. For levels between 0.50 and 0.54 L/L no clear advice is given in these guidelines. The question remains whether these guidelines are applicable to trans men, as the duration of testosterone therapy is much longer in trans men and hormone treatment can often not be discontinued.

In light of these considerations, the aim of this study is twofold:

1 To study the prevalence and determinants in the development of erythrocytosis in trans men on testosterone therapy.
2 To study the time relation between duration of testosterone therapy and hematocrit levels over the course of 20 years.

Based on the results of this study we discuss how these findings affects current practices regarding erythrocytosis in trans men.

Discussion

To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review of the literature on drug-induced erythrocytosis. Our search identified several classes of medications associated with erythrocytosis, including testosterone in cisgender and transgender patient populations, SGLT-2 inhibitors, and TKIs. In single studies, EPO and one treatment regimen for MDR-TB were also associated with erythrocytosis. Few studies reported on the diagnostic strategies undertaken for patients with drug-induced erythrocytosis. In a small number of studies, serum EPO level and JAK2 mutation testing were ordered. Patients rarely underwent formal investigations for other secondary causes of erythrocytosis, such as sleep apnea or hypoxic lung disease; however, this is likely attributable to the fact that most of the studies were retrospective, and many patients already had established diagnoses of other secondary causes.

The most common medication in this review was testosterone prescribed to cisgender men for the treatment of hypogonadism. Intramuscular route of administration, higher dose, and older age were all risk factors for erythrocytosis; however, thromboembolic complications were rare, with only 1 retrospective study describing an increased risk of major adverse cardiac events and venous thromboembolism in those on testosterone therapy who developed erythrocytosis, compared with those who did not develop erythrocytosis. Discontinuation of testosterone appears to allow hemoglobin and hematocrit to normalize. Dose reduction, aspirin, and phlebotomy have also been implemented, with phlebotomy initiated at hematocrit levels of 50% to 52%. This is similar to current Endocrine Society clinical practice guidelineson testosterone therapy in males with hypogonadism, which recommends temporarily holding testosterone if hematocrit levels exceed 54% and resuming therapy at a lower dose once hematocrit normalizes; phlebotomy is also recommended as an effective strategy.

### A guideline for the management of specific situations in polycythaemia vera and secondary erythrocytosis: a British Society for Haematology guideline [^115VpFNG]. British Journal of Haematology (2019). Medium credibility.

The evidence base for recommendations for the management of erythrocytosis in HPD remains limited. However, treatment of the underlying hypoxia reduces the Hct. Long term oxygen therapy improves survival in patients with COPD and severe hypoxaemia (PaO 2 below 7·3 kPa or < 8·0 kPa with nocturnal hypoventilation) (Crockett et al, 2001).

All patients with erythrocytosis consequent upon HPD should therefore be evaluated by a respiratory physician for consideration of long‐term oxygen therapy or alternative methods of improving oxygenation. If they are smokers they should be strongly advised to stop. In addition to supplemental oxygen, nocturnal oxygenation may also be improved by the use of non‐invasive ventilation. Therefore, failure to achieve adequate oxygenation in HPD should not be accepted without review by a specialist respiratory physician. Of benefit regarding limited venesection in patients with HPD, reducing the Hct to 0·50–0·52 led to an improvement in exercise tolerance but a further staged reduction of Hct to 0·45 did not give additional benefit as discussed in the previous guideline (McMullin et al, 2005). However, a Hct lower than 0·45 is detrimental to these patients, and associated with poorer outcome (Chambellan et al, 2005). It is of interest that ACEi (Leshem‐Rubinow et al, 2012) have the ability to reduce the Hct in this setting.

In the case of obstructive sleep apnoea, erythrocytosis is associated with nocturnal oxygen desaturation and such patients should be referred for appropriate investigation. Long term non‐invasive continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) has been shown to reduce erythrocytosis (Krieger, 1992).

Recommendations: hypoxic pulmonary disease

Patients with hypoxic pulmonary disease who develop erythrocytosis should be evaluated by a respiratory physician for consideration of long‐term oxygen therapy or alternative therapy. (GRADE 1A)
Patients who are symptomatic as a result of hyperviscosity or have a Hct > 0·56 should be considered for venesection to reduce this to 0·50–0·52. (GRADE 2C)

### Erythrocytosis and CKD: a review [^1126GtkK]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Erythrocytosis or polycythemia is defined as an increase in red blood cell concentration above the age- and sex-specific normal levels. Unlike anemia, which is very common in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), erythrocytosis is less frequent but requires specific understanding by health care professionals in order to provide the best care. Erythrocytosis, especially when undiagnosed and untreated, can lead to serious thrombotic events and higher mortality. Classic causes of erythrocytosis associated with CKD include cystic kidney diseases, kidney or other erythropoietin-secreting neoplasms, high-altitude renal syndrome, overdosage of erythropoietin-stimulating agents, androgen therapy, heavy smoking, chronic lung disease, obstructive sleep apnea, IgA nephropathy, post-kidney transplant erythrocytosis, renal artery stenosis, and congenital etiologies. After ruling out the common acquired causes of erythrocytosis and/or in the presence of suggestive parameters, primary erythrocytosis or polycythemia vera (PV) should be considered, and patients should be screened for JAK2V617F somatic mutation. The newest entity inducing erythrocytosis is linked to the use of sodium/glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors that hypothetically activate hypoxia-inducible factor 2α (HIF-2α) and in some cases unmask PV. This Review focuses on the pathogenesis, renal manifestations and management of PV, the pathophysiology of erythrocytosis induced by SGLT2 inhibitors and the relevance of timely JAK2 mutation screening in these patients.

### Erythrocytosis associated with carcinoma of the kidney… [^114s1Z5Q]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

THE ASSOCIATION of erythrocytosis with a variety of lesions of the kidney has been noted in an increasing number of cases. Hypernephroma has been the most common lesion, with some 49 cases having been reported, mostly within the last 5 years. The papers of Damon et al. 1 and Lawrence and Donald2 record most of these cases. The 11 cases of non-neoplastic renal lesions with erythrocytosis have been summarized by Jones et al.
3. From the hematologic standpoint, erythrocytosis is evident, with elevation of the hemoglobin, hematocrit, and red blood cell count, but, in contrast to polycythemia vera, leukocytosis, thrombocytosis, and splenomegaly are all lacking. The leukocyte alkaline phosphatase level, which is almost invariably elevated in polycythemia vera, is normal in renal erythrocytosis.
4. The relationship of a humoral factor controlling erythropoiesis and the kidney has been supported by a large body of experimental work.

Definition Polycythemia is a disease state in which the proportion of blood volume that is occupied by red blood cells increases. Blood volume proportions can be measured as hematocrit level. It can be due to an increase in the mass of red blood cells: "absolute polycythemia"; or to a decrease in the volume of plasma, "relative polycythemia". Familial polycythemia is a benign clinical course except for the complications of red blood cells. There are some instances in which polycythemia vera occurs in families, which results in the familial polycythemia.

For polycythemia to be reportable, the diagnosis MUST state polycythemia vera, or one of the other alternate names listed under 9950/3: Polycythemia Vera.

### Erythrocytosis in children and adolescents-classification, characterization, and consensus recommendations for the diagnostic approach [^1132gBET]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

During recent years, the increasing knowledge of genetic and physiological changes in polycythemia vera (PV) and of different types of congenital erythrocytosis has led to fundamental changes in recommendations for the diagnostic approach to patients with erythrocytosis. Although widely accepted for adult patients this approach may not be appropriate with regard to children and adolescents affected by erythrocytosis. The "congenital erythrocytosis" working group established within the framework of the MPN&MPNr-EuroNet (COST action BM0902) addressed this question in a consensus finding process and developed a specific algorithm for the diagnosis of erythrocytosis in childhood and adolescence which is presented here.

Introduction

Secondary erythrocytosis refers to an elevation in hemoglobin or hematocrit in response to elevated serum erythropoietin (EPO) levels, rather than intrinsic dysfunction of the bone marrow. The most common cause of secondary erythrocytosis is chronic hypoxia, which can result from conditions such as hypoxic lung disease, obstructive sleep apnea, smoking, and cyanotic heart disease. Other secondary causes include EPO-secreting tumors and posttransplantation erythrocytosis.

Medications are an increasingly recognized cause of secondary erythrocytosis. Testosterone has been well established in the literature to cause an elevation in hemoglobin and hematocrit. More recently, sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors have also been identified as a cause of drug-induced erythrocytosis.,

Current guidelines on the diagnosis and management of secondary erythrocytosis are limited. In 2005, the British Society of Haematology published guidelineson the investigation and management of erythrocytosis, with a subsequent amendmentin 2007 to include JAK2 mutation testing due to its role in polycythemia vera, a primary cause of erythrocytosis. These guidelines recommended a thorough history and physical examination, complete blood count (CBC) and peripheral film, JAK2 mutation testing, and other investigations to identify primary vs secondary causes. More recently, these guidelines were updated to provide recommendations for the management of several secondary causes of erythrocytosis; however, drug-induced erythrocytosis was not addressed.

Although guidelines for the management of drug-induced erythrocytosis related to testosterone are available, there is variability in the definition of erythrocytosis and recommendations. The 2018 American Urological Association guidelinesrecommended withholding testosterone if hematocrit exceeds 50% to investigate for an etiology and reducing the dose or temporarily discontinuing testosterone for hematocrit ≥ 54%. In comparison, the 2018 Endocrine Society guidelinesrecommended withholding testosterone for hematocrit > 54% until hematocrit normalizes, then resuming therapy at a lower dose; they also included therapeutic phlebotomy as an effective management strategy. Evidence to support specific hematocrit thresholds is lacking, and considerable uncertainty remains surrounding optimal management. Moreover, existing guidelines do not include suggestions on diagnostic investigations for other secondary causes of erythrocytosis and do not mention the role of cytoreductive therapy, antiplatelet agents, or anticoagulation. Furthermore, since the publication of these guidelines, new drugs associated with erythrocytosis have emerged, namely SGLT-2 inhibitors.

Cyanosis in adult congenital heart disease (ACHD) — definition, evaluation, and iron management: The definition of cyanosis is "bluish discoloration of the skin and/or mucous membranes resulting from inadequate oxygenation of the blood", and for cyanosis to be visible, at least 5 g/L of unsaturated hemoglobin in tissue is needed. Cyanotic heart disease encompasses a widely heterogeneous group; therefore, an individualized approach is needed for each patient according to the clinical details. Secondary erythrocytosis and polycythemia are fundamentally different conditions that require different treatments. Iron deficiency is frequently encountered in cyanotic individuals; consequences may include stroke and myocardial ischemia, and iron deficiency requires assessment of serum iron, ferritin, and transferrin levels because mean corpuscular volume is not a reliable screening test. Limited data suggest that treatment of transferrin saturation < 20% with iron supplementation until iron stores are replete can be done safely.
