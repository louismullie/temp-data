## Question

A 3-year-old boy is brought to a respiratory specialist. The family physician referred the child because of recurrent respiratory infections over the past 2 years. Chest X-rays showed a lesion of < 2 cm that includes glands and cysts in the upper lobe of the right lung. Diseases affecting the immune system were investigated and ruled out. No family history of any pulmonary disease or congenital malformations exists. He was born at full term via a normal vaginal delivery with an APGAR score of 10. Which of the following should be highly considered for effective management of this child's condition?
A. Antibiotics
B. Bronchoscopy
C. Lobectomy
D. Pneumonectomy

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which management option is most appropriate for a 3-year-old boy with recurrent respiratory infections and a right upper lobe lesion on chest X-ray described as containing glands and cysts, with immunologic workup negative and no family history of pulmonary disease. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the most likely diagnosis given the imaging description and clinical course. Then, I should verify the differential diagnoses that could mimic this presentation and why they are less likely. Next, I will review the standard of care for symptomatic congenital lung malformations and weigh the risks and benefits of surgery versus conservative management. After that, I need to check the role and limitations of bronchoscopy and antibiotics in this context. Finally, I will consider surgical extent and timing, and conclude with the most evidence-aligned recommendation.

> Let me first confirm the leading diagnosis. The description of a focal lung lesion with cysts and glandular elements in a child with recurrent infections strongly suggests a congenital pulmonary airway malformation (CPAM), previously termed congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation, which classically presents with cystic parenchymal changes and predisposes to recurrent infections due to abnormal airways and impaired clearance; the absence of immunodeficiency and the focal, lobar nature further support CPAM rather than diffuse interstitial lung disease or immunologic etiologies [^1152idmf] [^111Vc8r7].

> Wait, let me verify the differential before I jump to conclusions. Bronchopulmonary sequestration can also present with recurrent infections, but it typically shows systemic arterial supply from the aorta and is more often basilar; the vignette does not mention a systemic feeding vessel, making sequestration less likely unless proven otherwise on contrast-enhanced CT, which is the gold standard to define anatomy and vascular supply in congenital lung malformations [^1152idmf] [^111L9ypt]. Bronchogenic cysts are usually mediastinal or central and less likely to present with a purely parenchymal cystic lesion, and their management is generally surgical when symptomatic, but the imaging pattern here fits CPAM better than a classic bronchogenic cyst [^1152idmf]. Childhood interstitial lung disease (chILD) typically presents with diffuse disease and would be inconsistent with a localized cystic lesion, and the child's normal immune workup also argues against primary immunodeficiency mimics of recurrent pneumonia [^111T9wpg] [^114CVLwT].

> I should confirm the standard of care for symptomatic CPAM. Hold on, I should verify whether surgery is truly indicated here. Multiple sources converge on surgical resection as the treatment of choice for symptomatic CPAM because it addresses the anatomic driver of recurrent infections and mitigates risks of complications, including hemorrhage and potential malignant transformation; conservative management is generally reserved for asymptomatic cases or selected scenarios with close surveillance, not for children with recurrent infections attributable to the lesion [^1152idmf] [^111Vc8r7] [^112a9csY].

> Let me consider the role of bronchoscopy. Flexible bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage is useful to evaluate airway anatomy and obtain microbiology in children with recurrent or persistent pulmonary infiltrates, but it does not treat the structural lesion and will not prevent recurrence in CPAM; thus, it is adjunctive rather than definitive therapy in this context, and should not delay surgical consultation for a resectable malformation [^1156J9V6] [^1152idmf].

> I need to check the role of antibiotics. Antibiotics treat acute infections but do not correct the underlying cystic malformation; recurrent infections will continue unless the anatomic abnormality is removed, so antibiotics are supportive only and not definitive management in this scenario [^1152idmf] [^111Vc8r7].

> Now, regarding surgical extent, I initially thought a pneumonectomy might be necessary if the lesion is extensive, but wait, let me reconsider that. Pneumonectomy is disproportionate and rarely indicated for a localized CPAM confined to one lobe; the standard approach is lobectomy of the affected lobe, with parenchyma-sparing segmentectomy considered only in select, well-circumscribed lesions where complete excision is feasible and safe, acknowledging that CT can underestimate microscopic disease spread and that residual disease risks recurrence if resection is too limited [^1152idmf] [^115zGVpc] [^115p2166].

> Next, I should review timing and approach. Early elective resection is favored in symptomatic children to prevent further infections and complications, and minimally invasive techniques such as VATS are preferred when available to reduce morbidity; preoperative contrast-enhanced CT or MR angiography helps define anatomy and any anomalous vasculature to guide safe resection planning [^1152idmf] [^111L9ypt] [^112P8wkx].

> But wait, what if the lesion were actually a sequestration with a systemic feeding artery — would that change management? Even then, surgical resection (often lobectomy) with control of the aberrant systemic vessel remains the curative approach, and preoperative imaging to delineate vascular anatomy is essential to avoid hemorrhagic complications, reinforcing that surgery, not bronchoscopy or antibiotics, is the definitive therapy for congenital lung malformations presenting with recurrent infections [^1152idmf] [^113jBoYJ].

> Putting this together, I should double-check that my recommendation aligns with evidence and guidelines. Given recurrent respiratory infections attributable to a cystic, glandular lung lesion consistent with CPAM, definitive management is surgical resection of the affected lobe; therefore, lobectomy is the most appropriate next step, with bronchoscopy reserved for perioperative planning or infection assessment and antibiotics used only for acute treatment of infections, not as disease-modifying therapy [^1152idmf] [^111Vc8r7] [^1156J9V6].

> Final answer: Lobectomy is the most appropriate management for this child, as it addresses the underlying congenital malformation, prevents recurrent infections, and reduces long-term risks; bronchoscopy and antibiotics are adjunctive and not definitive, and pneumonectomy is not indicated for a localized lobar lesion [^1152idmf] [^111Vc8r7] [^115zGVpc].

---

The most likely diagnosis is a **congenital pulmonary airway malformation (CPAM)** [^1152idmf] given the cystic lesion with glands and recurrent infections. The most effective management is **lobectomy** [^115zGVpc] to prevent recurrent infections and malignant transformation [^115NgGTR]; antibiotics are for acute infections only and bronchoscopy is not definitive [^notfound]. Pneumonectomy is excessive and not indicated for a localized lesion [^115p2166].

---

## Differential diagnosis

The **differential diagnosis** for a cystic lung lesion with recurrent infections in a child includes:

- **Congenital pulmonary airway malformation (CPAM)**: A developmental anomaly with cystic lesions and glandular tissue, often presenting with recurrent infections [^1142xgLf].

- **Bronchopulmonary sequestration**: A nonfunctioning lung tissue with systemic arterial supply, frequently complicated by infection [^113jBoYJ].

- **Bronchogenic cyst**: A congenital cystic lesion that can cause recurrent infections and compressive symptoms [^111T6NtJ].

- **Pulmonary abscess or infected bulla**: Infectious lesions that can mimic congenital cystic lesions [^notfound].

Given the presence of cysts and glands on imaging, **CPAM is the most likely diagnosis** [^notfound].

---

## Indications for surgical intervention

Surgical resection is indicated in children with CPAM who have **recurrent respiratory infections**, respiratory distress, or risk of malignant transformation [^111Vc8r7]. The primary goals of surgery are to:

- Prevent recurrent infections and associated morbidity [^1152idmf].

- Remove the lesion to eliminate the risk of malignant transformation (e.g. pleuropulmonary blastoma) [^115NgGTR].

- Improve lung function and quality of life [^1136Eqx5].

---

## Surgical options

The main surgical options for managing CPAM include **lobectomy**, **pneumonectomy**, and **segmentectomy/wedge resection**. Lobectomy involves complete removal of the affected lobe and is the **standard treatment** for symptomatic CPAM, providing definitive cure with low recurrence [^111Vc8r7]. Pneumonectomy entails removal of the entire lung and is rarely indicated, reserved for extensive multilobar disease or when lobectomy is not feasible; it carries higher morbidity and is not indicated for localized lesions [^notfound]. Segmentectomy or wedge resection removes only the affected segment or lesion and may be considered for small, localized lesions; however, there is a higher risk of recurrence if residual abnormal tissue remains [^115p2166].

---

## Role of antibiotics and bronchoscopy

Antibiotics are used to treat acute infections but **do not address the underlying congenital lesion**; recurrent infections will continue until the lesion is surgically removed [^notfound]. Bronchoscopy is useful for evaluating airway anatomy, obtaining samples for microbiological analysis, and removing obstructive material; however, it is not definitive for managing congenital cystic lesions such as CPAM [^1156J9V6].

---

## Recommended management strategy

Based on the clinical presentation, imaging findings, and current evidence, **the recommended management strategy** for this patient is **lobectomy** [^115zGVpc]. This approach provides definitive treatment by removing the affected lobe, preventing recurrent infections, and eliminating the risk of malignant transformation. Lobectomy is the **gold standard** for symptomatic CPAM and is associated with excellent long-term outcomes [^1142xgLf].

---

## Conclusion

The most effective management for a 3-year-old boy with recurrent respiratory infections and a cystic lesion with glands in the right upper lobe is **lobectomy** [^115zGVpc]. This surgical approach addresses the underlying congenital lesion, prevents recurrent infections, and eliminates the risk of malignant transformation. Antibiotics and bronchoscopy are adjunctive therapies but do not provide definitive treatment [^1152idmf].

The child who has recurrent infections poses one of the most difficult diagnostic challenges in pediatrics. The clinician faces a two-fold challenge in determining first whether the child is normal or has a serious disease, and then, in the latter case, how to confirm or exclude the diagnosis with the minimum number of the least invasive tests. It is hoped that, in the absence of good-quality evidence for most clinical scenarios, the experience-based approach described in this article may prove a useful guide to the clinician.

Structural upper and lower airway disorders and parenchymal disorders are uncommon in pediatric practice, but many pediatricians will encounter them and be responsible for the ongoing care of these patients. Pediatricians need to be cognizant of these diagnoses because, even though management of these disorders generally lacks an evidence base, existing principles of good care surrounding accurate diagnosis, classifications of severity, judicious use of investigations, medication, and surgical approaches are essential to good outcomes.

Childhood interstitial lung disease (chILD) syndrome — epidemiology and determinants of diagnostic evaluation emphasize rarity and multiple clinical factors guiding testing. There are few data regarding the prevalence of chILD syndrome, although it appears that chILD syndrome is rare. The urgency of the diagnostic evaluation, the choice of diagnostic tests, and decisions about genetic testing and/or lung biopsy depend upon the clinical context, disease severity, acuity, and duration, as well as the trend toward worsening or improvement, age at presentation, immunocompetence, and family history. Assessment of severity may be based on the degree of symptoms and gas exchange abnormalities, or the presence of echocardiographic evidence of pulmonary hypertension, and imaging can show disease distribution and extent but may not correlate with functional severity, response to therapy, or prognosis.

The figure states a proposed general diagnostic approach for chILD syndrome, with panel A for negative family history and panel B for positive family history. For negative family history of ILD or chILD syndrome, rule out/treat underlying disease with Infection/Sepsis/Pneumonia: Appropriate Cultures; CHD/Pulmonary Hypertension: Echocardiogram; HIV/Immunodeficiency; CF; Recurrent Aspiration; after specific diagnosis ruled out, the chILD syndrome negative family history pathway proceeds to CVHRCT, genetic testing (see Figure 4), or directly to lung biopsy with electron microscopy if there is rapid deterioration or progression; CVHRCT can yield normal or other specific diagnosis, non-diagnostic diffuse lung disease, or findings suggestive of surfactant mutation that prompt genetic testing, which may be diagnostic (specific diagnosis established) or lead to lung biopsy with electron microscopy. For positive family history of ILD or chILD syndrome, the same rule out/treat underlying disease items apply, followed by chILD syndrome positive family history with CVHRCT, genetic testing, and the same terminal outcomes including lung biopsy with electron microscopy; dotted lines indicate paths that may be considered depending on clinical context, and controlled ventilation high-resolution computed tomography (CVHRCT) is included as the preferred method of CT imaging; genetic analysis of surfactant proteins may take several weeks and lung biopsy may be necessary to guide clinical decision making in rapidly progressive cases.

### Evaluating the child with recurrent lower respiratory tract infections [^1123Thff]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

We review the limited available evidence on underlying causes of recurrent pneumonia in children, supplemented by our own clinical experience. Diagnosing recurrent pneumonia in children is difficult. Diagnostic confusion is possible with recurrent upper respiratory tract infections and asthma. In our series of children with recurrent pneumonia, we never identified asthma as an underlying cause. Because the frequency or severity of recurrent pneumonia does not always justify additional invasive investigations, the diagnostic work-up may be incomplete in a number of cases. This may help to explain why an underlying cause for recurrent pneumonia cannot be found in approximately 30% of cases. Finally, the paradigm that recurrent pneumonia in the same lung lobe has a differential diagnosis different from those recurring in multiple lobes was not borne out in our case series. A stepwise and pragmatic approach to evaluating children with recurrent lower respiratory tract infections is recommended.

Intralobar sequestrations usually present with recurrent infections, although they can also be asymptomatic and incidentally detected. For symptomatic patients, surgical excision is usually done. In asymptomatic patients, elective surgical excision is also usually preferred due to the risks of recurrent infection, hemorrhage, and possible risk of malignancy. Demonstrating vascular structures in detail on CT before surgery is essential to prevent surgical complications and obtain successful surgical outcomes.

### Shall all congenital cystic lung malformations be removed? the case in favour [^115NgGTR]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

The need to systematically remove congenital cystic lung lesions is based on three main arguments. First, cystic malformations are often considered as congenital cystic adenomatoid malformations (CCAM), while other less favorable diagnoses are possible, such as pleuropulmonary blastoma. Only postsurgical pathological analysis allows diagnosis. Second, there are clinical and biological arguments for considering macrocystic lesions as likely to degenerate. The only prevention is surgical removal. Finally, there is no recommendation on how to follow these children, in the absence of removal, causing unnecessary family stress. This seems unjustified, compared to a feasibility of thoracoscopic removal in most cases.

Introduction

Congenital pulmonary airway malformations (CPAM) belong to a group of rare congenital lung anomalies whose pathological origin is still barely understood. Postnatal clinical management of CPAM generally implies the surgical removal of the lesions to prevent two possible complications: a malignant transformation of these malformations and/or an increased risk of cystic malformation infection. Nowadays, some medical centres apply a more conservative approach consisting of a clinical follow-up without applying systematic surgery; the pro and contra arguments being adjusted between the low risks of such complications pondered by a surgical intervention. CPAM classifications have been proposed by Stocker – CPAM types 1 to 4, and by Langston – small and large cyst types. These classifications rely on a macroscopic anatomical description completed by a histological description of the lesion performed after surgical resection. The classification of lesions is essential, as each CPAM type carries a different risk of complications. However, accurately assessing this risk remains challenging, and there is a need for new classification schemes.

### Congenital pulmonary airway malformation (CPAM) with initial presentation in an adult: a rare presentation of a rare disease [^113xv9Vt]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

Congenital pulmonary airway malformation (CPAM) is a rare congenital abnormality with unknown exact aetiology or clear genetic association. It is characterised by a failure of bronchial development and localised glandular overgrowth. Typically, it is diagnosed on prenatal ultrasound, only infrequently in children, and even less commonly in adults. We present a case of a 25-year-old man, with no previous lung diseases who presented with right-sided chest pain, fever and cough suggestive of pulmonary infection. Chest imaging, including CT scan, showed a large focal cystic mass within the right lower lobe along with ground glass opacities suggestive of CPAM. He was started on intravenous antibiotics. Bronchoscopy showed a large amount of pus in the right lung and bronchoalveolar lavage confirmed the microbiological diagnosis of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. He improved with antibiotic treatment. He was discharged with 6-week course of antibiotics and follow-up afterward.

### Congenital pulmonary airway malformation: a case report and review of the literature [^113T1w7f]. Respiratory Care (2012). Low credibility.

Congenital parenchymal lung malformations have an estimated incidence at 1:25,000–1:35,000 births. We present a case of this rare congenital abnormality in a 38 year-old male, review the current literature with discussion of proposed causes, malignant potential, and management strategies. A 38-year-old white male presented with a 4-day history of chronic stable hemoptysis. Social history was notable for a 50-pack-year active smoking history and remote heavy alcohol consumption. Physical examination was normal. Chest radiograph revealed an ill defined right lower lobe infiltrate. Chest computed tomography demonstrated an irregular, thin-walled, cystic lesion with adjacent nodularity and calcifications. The patient received a right lower lobectomy. Pathologic specimen demonstrated a 10-cm, mostly thin-walled cyst with features suggestive of a congenital cyst adenomatoid malformation and areas of adenocarcinoma (mixed subtype with acinar and bronchioloalveolar patterns). Congenital cyst adenomatoid malformations have recently been renamed as congenital pulmonary airway malformations and are the most common type of congenital parenchymal lung malformations. Individuals typically present with recurrent pulmonary infections, pneumothorax, or hemoptysis. The development is controversial but believed to be a result of arrested development of the fetal bronchial tree during the sixth and seventh week of fetal development. Defects in thyroid transcription factor 1 have also been proposed. With the increasing use and image resolution of ultrasound in modern obstetric practice, congenital pulmonary airway malformations rarely go undetected into adulthood. Management remains controversial; however, most authors agree with early surgical excision.

### An adult with episodic retrosternal chest pain: an unusual presentation of congenital pulmonary airway malformation-case report [^1142xgLf]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

CPAM are multi-cystic segmental areas of lung tissue with abnormal broncho-alveolar development and hamartomatous proliferation of terminal respiratory units in a gland-like pattern (adenomatoid) without proper alveolar formation. The estimated incidence is 1:1500–4000 live births. Nearly all cases are diagnosed in the perinatal period and in adults CPAM are uncommon. CPAM appear as isolated cystic or solid intrathoracic mass lesions confined to one lobe, and based on the size of the cysts classified by Stoker et al. into three major histologic subtypes. Type-I CPAM are composed of variable-size cysts, with at least one dominant cyst (> 2 cm in diameter); type-II CPAM are composed of smaller, uniform cysts less than 1 cm in diameter; and type-III CPAM are a solid mass composed of microcysts. Like congenital lobar emphysema (CLE), CPAM cause a mass effect displacing the mediastinum to the opposite side. Patients with CPAM may be asymptomatic or present with symptoms, which are mainly respiratory, for example, in neonates and infants CPAM are a cause of respiratory distress, and children may present with life-threatening pulmonary infections. In adults CPAM are rare and a case of an adult presenting with pulmonary infection with fever, cough and chest pain previously described for type -III CPAM. Contrast enhanced CT scan accurately delineates the location and extent of the lesion and helps identify the systemic arterial supply seen in 25% of cases and any other associated congenital anomalies. Surgical resection of the affected lobe via a standard thoracotomy is the recommended treatment of choice in symptomatic patients. Careful histological examination of the surgically resected specimen helps confirm the diagnosis and exclude malignancy. Lobectomy prevents the development of complications of pulmonary infections and the possible development of malignancy.

Question 1 — clinical diagnosis of lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) by high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) — asks, "Should patients be clinically diagnosed with LAM on the basis of their HRCT findings alone if they have cystic changes in the lung parenchyma that are characteristic of LAM but have no additional confirmatory characteristics of LAM (i.e., clinical, radiologic, or serologic)?" Background notes that "The advent of HRCT of the chest has transformed the field of diffuse cystic lung disease", that "A critical review of HRCT features can often reveal patterns that are diagnostic in a significant proportion of patients with diffuse cystic lung diseases", and defines "The characteristic HRCT pattern of LAM" as "the presence of multiple, bilateral, uniform, round, thin-walled cysts present in a diffuse distribution", adding "It has been suggested that the diagnosis of LAM can be established with a fair degree of certainty on the basis of the presence of characteristic HRCT features alone".

Comment

CPAM, previously known as congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation, is a developmental anomaly of the lower respiratory tract as a result of cessation of lung development during various stages of embryogenesis. Different types of CPAMs are thought to originate at different levels of the tracheobronchial tree, leading to distinct histopathologic differentiation, clinical features, and malignant potential. The most common symptoms of CPAM include recurrent pulmonary infection, respiratory distress, pneumothorax, and malignancy. The treatment for symptomatic CPAM is clear — surgery. However, treatment for asymptomatic CPAM remains less clear, as the long-term progression remains unknown.

Cook and colleaguesdescribed the 10-year clinical course of 119 children prenatally diagnosed with CPAM. Fifty-one (43%) were managed surgically (average age of 1.6 years) and 68 (57%) conservatively. Of those managed conservatively, 52 (76%) continued to be asymptomatic for a median follow-up of 9.9 years. The conclusion of this study suggested that conservative management is a reasonable option in select cases. Similarly, a retrospective Swedish study showed that 69% of patients could be managed conservatively with a median follow-up of 4 years. Prenatal regression was even demonstrated. However, our case highlights that with longer follow-up, disease progression is possible.

Kotecha and colleaguesproposed 4 arguments to justify a surgical approach in the management of all asymptomatic CPAM — risk of malignancy, infection and pneumothorax, the potential for compensatory lung regrowth following early resection, and reduction in postoperative complications following elective surgery. Our case demonstrates an additional argument — early resection may allow for lung-sparing procedures. Stanton and colleaguesperformed a meta-analysis of a 9-case series and calculated a greater than 2-fold increase in risk of postoperative complications in symptomatic compared with asymptomatic patients, further suggesting a role for elective surgery in asymptomatic patients. Although there were many barriers for our patient obtaining consistent care, earlier diagnosis with early resection could have entailed a lobectomy versus a pneumonectomy.

### Interstitial lung disease in children younger than 2 years [^114sGHJc]. Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Childhood interstitial lung disease (chILD) represents a highly heterogeneous group of rare disorders associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Although our understanding of chILD remains limited, important advances have recently been made, the most important being probably the appreciation that disorders that present in early life are distinct from those occurring in older children and adults, albeit with some overlap. chILD manifests with diffuse pulmonary infiltrates and nonspecific respiratory signs and symptoms, making exclusion of common conditions presenting in a similar fashion an essential preliminary step. Subsequently, a systematic approach to diagnosis includes a careful history and physical examination, computed tomography of the chest, and some or all of bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage, genetic testing, and if diagnostic uncertainty persists, lung biopsy. This review focuses on chILD presenting in infants younger than 2 years of age and discusses recent advances in the classification, diagnostic approach, and management of chILD in this age range. We describe novel genetic entities, along with initiatives that aim at collecting clinical data and biologic samples from carefully characterized patients in a prospective and standardized fashion. Early referral to expert centers and timely diagnosis may have important implications for patient management and prognosis, but effective therapies are often lacking. Following massive efforts, international collaborations among the key stakeholders are finally starting to be in place. These have allowed the setting up and conducting of the first randomized controlled trial of therapeutic interventions in patients with chILD.

### Congenital lung malformations [^1152idmf]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2023). High credibility.

Congenital lung malformations (CLMs) are rare developmental anomalies of the lung, including congenital pulmonary airway malformations (CPAM), bronchopulmonary sequestration, congenital lobar overinflation, bronchogenic cyst and isolated congenital bronchial atresia. CLMs occur in 4 out of 10,000 live births. Postnatal presentation ranges from an asymptomatic infant to respiratory failure. CLMs are typically diagnosed with antenatal ultrasonography and confirmed by chest CT angiography in the first few months of life. Although surgical treatment is the gold standard for symptomatic CLMs, a consensus on asymptomatic cases has not been reached. Resection, either thoracoscopically or through thoracotomy, minimizes the risk of local morbidity, including recurrent infections and pneumothorax, and avoids the risk of malignancies that have been associated with CPAM, bronchopulmonary sequestration and bronchogenic cyst. However, some surgeons suggest expectant management as the incidence of adverse outcomes, including malignancy, remains unknown. In either case, a planned follow-up and a proper transition to adult care are needed. The biological mechanisms through which some CLMs may trigger malignant transformation are under investigation. KRAS has already been confirmed to be somatically mutated in CPAM and other genetic susceptibilities linked to tumour development have been explored. By summarizing current progress in CLM diagnosis, management and molecular understanding we hope to highlight open questions that require urgent attention.

### ESR essentials: imaging of common paediatric pulmonary diseases-practice recommendations by the European society of paediatric radiology [^111L9ypt]. European Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Imaging plays a crucial role in both diagnosis and presurgical assessment of CPAM. On CR, CPAM may appear as a focal opacity with fluid-filled cysts (Fig. 5A). Resorption of amniotic fluid alters radiographic appearances, resulting in lucent air-filled masses with or without compression of surrounding lung parenchyma and mediastinum. CECT at 2 months of age is the gold standard for defining CPAM size, location, and vascular supply, aiding thoracic surgeons in surgical planning (Fig. 5B). Dedicated radiology reports are available to summarise crucial CPAM features. MRI for assessment of CPAM characteristics carries the advantages of evaluating vascular supply without contrast use and enabling long-term follow-up of asymptomatic children without radiation exposure. Treatment strategies for CPAM vary among paediatric surgeons, with some advocating for early surgery in the first year of life to promote compensatory lung parenchymal growth and prevent complications from recurrent infections. Those in favour of early surgery also consider the unclear risk of malignant transformation in CPAM. Alternatively, a watch-and-wait strategy with long-term follow-up in asymptomatic cases may be preferred, as invasive surgery and general anaesthesia may have negative effects on long-term neurodevelopment and some potentially serious or even life-threatening complications. Timing of resection is still debated; some surgeons prefer earlier surgery, by 4 months of age and some as late as 1 year of age, although delayed resection has not shown improved outcomes.

Not only agenesis of a lung, but also agenesis of a lobe may occur and simulate lobectomy or collapse of a lobe.

Imaging features of pulmonary hypoplasia are a decrease in ipsilateral lung volume and pulmonary artery, narrowing of intercostal spaces, compensatory hyperinflation, and mediastinal shift (Fig. 3).

Fig. 3
Imaging findings of pulmonary hypoplasia. Chest X-ray (a) and axial CT image (b) of a 26-year-old male presenting with recurrent infection demonstrate pulmonary hypoplasia of the right lung. Although bronchi and alveoli are present in underdeveloped lungs, the size of the right lung is decreased. Consolidations due to infection can also be seen on axial CT (b)

Underdevelopment anomalies in adults can be asymptomatic or symptomatic as a result of recurrent infections or pulmonary hypertension. Recurrent infections can also cause bronchiectasis which may lead to recurrent hemoptysis.

Congenital pulmonary airway malformation (CPAM)

CPAM was previously called congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation, but due to the absence of adenomatoid and cystic changes in all types of the disease, CPAM is now accepted as a more appropriate name for these congenital lung diseases. CPAM is divided into 5 types (0–4) according to the recent classification. Type 0, a very rare and lethal type of CPAM, consists of severe acinar dysgenesis or airway dysplasia. Type 1, the most common type and most frequently seen in adults because of its better prognosis, presents with one or multiple large cysts (2–10 cm). Type 2, probably lethal because of the associated cardiac and renal anomalies, is defined by solitary or multiple cysts 0.5–2 cm in size. Type 3, which has a poor prognosis and is rarely seen in adults, involves the entire lobe and appears solid due to microcysts (< 0.5 cm). Type 4 typically affects a single lobe and can be confused with pleuropulmonary blastoma because of large cystic lesions on radiological images.

American Thoracic Society/Japanese Respiratory Society — diagnostic approach for lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) with high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) cysts but no confirmatory features states that when a definitive diagnosis is required in patients who have parenchymal cysts on HRCT that are characteristic of LAM, but no additional confirmatory features of LAM, "we suggest a diagnostic approach that includes transbronchial lung biopsy before a surgical lung biopsy (conditional recommendation, very low confidence in the estimated effects)". The panel notes the advantage of transbronchial lung biopsy as a less-invasive method compared with surgical lung biopsy, advises expert center consultation and pathology review to help avoid false negatives, and cites a study of 21 consecutive patients with a diagnostic yield of 71% that was inversely correlated with diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DlCO); the values and preferences statement places a high value on risk reduction and cost savings and a lower value on confirmation with a single diagnostic test.

### Recurrent lower respiratory tract infections in children: a practical approach to diagnosis [^116wxsZC]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Many children are affected by recurrent lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs), but the majority of them do not suffer from serious lung or extrapulmonary disease. The challenge for clinicians is to distinguish the recurrent RTIs with self-limiting or minor problems from those with underlying disease. The aim of this review is to describe a practical approach to children with recurrent LRTIs that limits unnecessary, expensive and time-consuming investigations. The children can be divided into three groups on the basis of their personal and family history and clinical findings: 1) otherwise healthy children who do not need further investigations; 2) those with risk factors for respiratory infections for whom a wait-and-see approach can be recommended; and 3) those in whom further investigations are mandatory. However, regardless of the origin of the recurrent LRTIs, it is important to remember that prevention by means of vaccines against respiratory pathogens (i.e. type b Haemophilus influenzae, pertussis, pneumococcal and influenza vaccines) can play a key role.

### Uniportal video-assisted thoracoscopic anatomical resection of the right anterior pulmonary segment in a 10-year-old child with congenital pulmonary airway malformation [^112P8wkx]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

CPAMs (formerly CCAMs) are very rare developmental anomalies ranging in incidence from 1 in 11,000–35,000 live births. The Stocker classification specifies three major types (I-III) of CCAM, based on cyst size and characteristics. As of 2002, CPAM replaced CCAM in the nomenclature, and two more types of CPAM were designated. Type 0 arises from the trachea, and type 4 has alveolar and distal acinar origins. Type 1 accounts for most (60–70%) of such lesions, showing variably sized cysts (1–10 cm) of which at least one is dominant (> 2 cm across). Adjacent parenchyma is relatively normal, and in a majority of cases, only one lobe of lung is involved. Malignant transformation has been reported in CPAM types 1–4. In fact, respiratory symptoms and related conditions (pneumothorax, pneumonia, recurrent pulmonary infections, or malignancy) may be later developments in prenatally diagnosed infants, who are largely asymptomatic at birth. We fortuitously discovered a single cystic lesion and a consolidated area in RUL (anterior segment) upon neck CT of our patient. Despite her lack of symptoms, clinical suspicion of CPAM prompted further examination and subsequent surgical intervention.

Many authorities presently recommend surgical resection of these defects to eliminate the risk of developing malignancies, such as pleuropulmonary blastoma or bronchioalveolar carcinoma. Ultimately, our patient successfully underwent uniportal VATS S3 anterior segmentectomy, without drainage tube placement. Uniportal access was feasible, because only mediastinal pleura (in the vicinity of RUL pulmonary artery) showed severe adhesions. Also, a VATS approach was chosen for its reputed benefits, namely reduced durations of hospital stay and chest tube placement and mitigation of thoracotomy-related morbidity risk. In a growing child, thoracotomy incision may result in shoulder girdle weakness, chest deformities, or scoliosis. Controversy over the extent of surgery in instances of CPAM is ongoing, specifically whether removal of an entire lobe or a segment only (to preserve lung tissue) is appropriate. Recent reports have shown that in patients with small and asymptomatic lesions, anatomic segmentectomy, as opposed to traditional lobectomy, does not heighten chances of residual or recurrent disease.

### Prenatal and postnatal management of congenital pulmonary airway malformation [^113LSskY]. Neonatology (2016). Low credibility.

Congenital pulmonary airway malformation (CPAM) is one of the most common lung lesions detected prenatally. Despite the research efforts made in the past few years, controversy and lack of clarity in the literature still exist regarding nomenclature, classification, pathogenesis and the management of CPAM. Therefore, it is of greatest importance to delineate the natural history of CPAMs and to create a consensus to guide the management and follow-up of these lesions. This review will focus on classification systems, highlighting the most recent advancements in pathogenesis, and current practice in the prenatal diagnosis of CPAM. Strategies of prenatal management and postnatal management will be reviewed. Long-term follow-up, including lung cancer risk, is discussed and an outcome perspective is presented.

Understanding of coronavirus disease 2019 is rapidly evolving with new articles on the subject daily. This flood of articles can be overwhelming for busy practicing clinicians looking for key pieces of information that can be applied in daily practice. This review article synthesizes the reported imaging findings in pediatric Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) across the literature, offers imaging differential diagnostic considerations and useful radiographic features to help differentiate these entities from COVID-19, and provides recommendations for requesting imaging studies to evaluate suspected cases of pediatric COVID-19.

### Pulmonary involvement in a case of juvenile-onset recurrent respiratory papillomatosis [^113EKAvt]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2003). Low credibility.

Juvenile-onset recurrent respiratory papillomatosis is primarily a disease of children and adolescents. Although most patients experience spontaneous regression at a later age, some patients continue to be affected throughout their lives. We report the case of a 35-year-old woman with a 33-year history of juvenile-onset recurrent respiratory papillomatosis who developed pulmonary dissemination with malignant transformation. Malignant transformation is the most feared sequela of pulmonary dissemination, and it should be addressed aggressively. If treated promptly, the patient can enjoy prolonged survival. Computed tomography is superior to plain radiography for detecting and evaluating the extent of disease.

### Natural course of CPAM and pulmonary sequestration: to operate or not to operate, this is the question [^114bRq7u]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2025). Medium credibility.

When patients with CPAM present with respiratory symptoms, surgical resection is usually recommended and executed. However, a significant part of the children with CPAM is asymptomatic at birth and remain so during childhood. For this group some advice elective surgery, while others recommend a conservative approach.

Arguments for the recommendation of an active surgical approach are the possibility of development of respiratory symptoms as persistent cough or recurrent airway infections. The latter may cause alterations of lung and pleura which can increase the risk of complications during or after surgery. Furthermore, early resection could facilitate optimal lung growth of the rest of the lobe. Another argument that is frequently mentioned is the possible relation between CPAM and malignant degeneration, like bronchioalveolar carcinoma and pleuropulmonary blastoma. Children with a presence of mediastinal shift on postnatal imaging, a high CPAM volume ratio (CVR) and a large lesion during gestation are more likely to require surgeryHowever, no strong evidence supports these arguments and clinical, mostly retrospective reports sometimes show variable results.

Those who support a conservative approach argue that elective surgery in infants and young children is not without risk, and can be seen as overtreatment as most of the children are asymptomatic at birth and remain so during childhood. Furthermore, some case reports have shown malignant degeneration in other areas of the lung even after elective surgery of the CPAM.

Despite the increasing incidence and multiple publications on this topic, consensus is lacking and actually there are no uniform management guidelines. A result of this is that postnatal management of asymptomatic children with a CTM differs between centers. Much is still unknown about the natural course of CPAM, etiology, the best treatment options, including optimal age for resection, choice for surgical technique and structure of follow‐up.

A three‐round Delphi study was conducted in 2020 to find a set of outcome parameters concerning respiratory insufficiency, surgical complications, mass effect and multifocal disease. These parameters have been incorporated in the CONNECT trial, a randomized controlled multicenter trial aiming to compare conservative and surgical management of patients with an asymptomatic CPAM. Data from these study will hopefully provide valuable information on the mid to long term outcome of this patient group.

### Rare presentation of pneumothorax in a young woman with underlying congenital pulmonary airway malformation [^1136Eqx5]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

Learning points

Congenital pulmonary airway malformation (CPAM) is the most common among a rare group of congenital anomalies of the lower respiratory tract.
Diagnosing congenital anomalies in adults is often challenging and can easily be overlooked. We suggest including CPAM in a broad list of differentials in adult patients who present with pneumothorax, cystic lung disease, recurrent chest infection and/or haemoptysis.
Early diagnosis of CPAM and timely intervention can potentially avoid life-threatening complications and improve quality of life. It is noteworthy that surgery can be curative.

### An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline: classification, evaluation, and management of childhood interstitial lung disease in infancy [^11116sms]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2013). Medium credibility.

Childhood interstitial lung disease (chILD) in infancy — indication for surgical lung biopsy: For neonates and infants with chILD syndrome in whom other diagnostic investigations have not identified the precise chILD disease, or in whom there is clinical urgency to identify the precise chILD disease, we recommend surgical lung biopsy (strong recommendation). The rationale notes that the finding that lung biopsy is more likely to determine a specific chILD disease than less invasive procedures and that performing a surgical lung biopsy rather than a less invasive procedure has more upsides than downsides; the recommendation is strong despite these limitations.

### Aspiration of superabsorbent polymer beads resulting in focal lung damage: a case report [^116urudy]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A 3-year-old boy was referred to the King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center (KFSH&RC) from the regional hospital in Al-Ahsa region in the eastern province of Saudi Arabia. The patients experienced recurrent chest infections associated with a persistent wet cough which resulted in four hospitalizations over the last year. The child was born uneventfully after stable pregnancy and had no remarkable background history in the first 2 years of his life apart from infrequent mild upper respiratory tract infections without symptoms, suggestive of a lower respiratory tract infection. Shortly after his second birthday, the boy had the first onset of lower respiratory tract infections and presented to the local hospital with fever, tachypnea, and respiratory distress, significant enough to require ICU admission. He responded partially to the initial regimen with oxygen therapy, systemic antibiotics, and systemic steroid and nebulized bronchodilators during the hospitalization. His cough persisted after he was discharged from the hospital and he soon suffered from additional attacks during which his symptoms worsened. His symptoms included respiratory distress, an aggravated cough, and hypoxia, and required frequent emergency visits and a total of 4 hospitalizations over the course of 1 year. The patient's parents are non-consanguineous, and there was no history of respiratory infections or symptoms in the family. Upon examination of the patient's immune system, test results showed normal immunoglobulin levels and normal lymphocyte markers. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest (Fig. 1) indicated multiple cystic changes within the posterior segment of left lower lobe, which most likely represented bronchiectasis changes. FB ingestion was suspected after radiology; however, congenital lung malformation could not be ruled out. At this point, the clinical and radiological presentation were suggestive of a foreign body had been ingested by the child and was overlooked. Consequently, the child was referred to our facility where we performed flexible bronchoscopy after the boy had been ill for 1 year.

### Management of a rare case of lymphangioleiomyomatosis complicated by recurrent pneumothorax [^116hENQZ]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

Summary

A female of reproductive age presents to the emergency department with progressive dyspnoea due to pneumothorax. She has a history of lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) diagnosed by lung biopsy 15 years ago following incidental finding of pneumothorax. Despite various procedural and medicinal treatments, she continued to have recurrent pneumothorax, with three hospital admissions over the preceding 3 months. LAM is a rare cystic lung disease affecting the lymphatic system, which most commonly affects women of childbearing age. It can be diagnosed via imaging or tissue biopsy (gold standard). Treatment can be difficult, and it often requires highly specialised care by pulmonologists and often confers significant limitations to patients' independence and quality of life. Family physicians are often part of multidisciplinary team to provide care to patients with rare chronic conditions.

### Immunological investigations in children with recurrent respiratory infections [^114CVLwT]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

Respiratory tract infections are common diseases in childhood. Most children with recurrent respiratory infections do not have an immunodeficiency. If they do, this is often due to an antibody deficiency. An important point in the investigation of a child with recurrent respiratory infections is to assess whether the child is thriving. If not, an underlying disease should be sought. Immunological investigations are useful if other, more frequent, underlying diseases have been ruled out. Early immunological screening is mandatory if there is a family history of immunodeficiency. In this review, a protocol is described which identifies children with severe antibody deficiency by simple screening tests before recurrent infections have caused irrepairable damage to the lungs. More elaborate tests are used to detect milder antibody deficiencies. These are reserved for those children in whom symptoms persist.

### Haemoptysis caused by the absence of the right pulmonary vein in an 11-year-old child: a case report and literature review [^113UjChN]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

An 11-year-old girl was admitted to the hospital with a complaint of intermittent cough and haemoptysis for two months. Haemoptysis presented as the expectoration of bloody sputum, which lasted for 2 days, 4–5 times/day. No other symptoms such as epistaxis, fever, tachypnoea, wheezing, dyspnoea, dizziness, headache, chest tightness, nausea, vomiting or bloody stool were described during the disease course. Eight days before admission, symptoms of cough worsened to more than 10 episodes per day, accompanied by a runny nose, nasal obstruction, yellow phlegm and sometimes blood in the sputum. Blood routine test, biochemistry and coagulation function tests at the local hospital revealed no abnormalities. Chest CT at the local hospital revealed cystic and low attenuation lesions, patchy and flocculent shadows in the right lung, partial bronchial dilatation and interlobular septal thickening of the right lung. In addition, small nodules were observed in the middle lobe of the right lung and lower lobe of the left lung. The boundaries of the nodules were clear, and the maximum diameter was approximately 0.4 cm. The local hospital considered the diagnosis to be "interstitial pneumonia and bronchiectasis with infection". After the anti-infective and haemostatic treatment, the symptoms of cough and haemoptysis were not relieved. Therefore, this patient was admitted to our hospital for further treatment.

The patient was hospitalized for pneumonia once 3 years ago, but the specific diagnosis, treatment process and examination results could not be provided. The patient had a history of recurrent upper respiratory tract infections (> 7 times/year) in the past year. A decreased activity tolerance was reported in 1.5 years. The history of foreign body aspiration, direct contact with tuberculosis patients or hereditary haemorrhagic diseases prior to illness onset was denied. The patient was a full-term baby with a birth weight of 2200 g. There was no birth history of asphyxia or rescue. The growth and development of this patient were similar to those of her peers. She had no family history of similar conditions and denied a family history of genetic or vascular anomalies. Her mother did not have regular antenatal examinations during pregnancy and could not provide the results of prenatal ultrasound.

### Is radical lobectomy required in congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation? [^115zGVpc]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The extent of surgical resection in the management of congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation (CCAM) located in 1 pulmonary lobe remains controversial. Although lobectomy seems to be the best treatment to avoid recurrent pulmonary infection and neoplasia, neither retrospective nor prospective studies have been done to our knowledge. Besides, many reports claim that there are advantages of parenchyma-saving resections. The aim of our study was to determine whether it was necessary to perform an extended resection in these cases.

Materials and Methods

We retrospectively reviewed all patients who had undergone a thoracoscopic lobectomy for CCAM located to 1 pulmonary lobe between January 2007 and January 2009. A thoracic radiologist performed a single blind review of all preoperative computed tomographic (CT) scans, mentioning the presence or absence of distant lesions from the main cysts of CCAM within the pulmonary lobe. The pathologist who analyzed the pulmonary lobectomy specimen was aware of the diagnosis but not the CT report.

Results

Twenty-five patients underwent thoracoscopic lobectomy for congenital lung malformations, including 12 with CCAM. All had a positive prenatal sonogram. The median age at surgery was 12 months (range, 2–24 months). The preoperative CT showed only 2 cases with distant lesions within the affected pulmonary lobe, whereas the histologic study of the surgical specimen identified 6 cases. The sensitivity of the CT scan was low, 33%, whereas its specificity was high, 100%. Furthermore, the preoperative CT negative predictive value was 60%. The median time of follow-up was 7.5 months.

Conclusion

Adequate treatment of CCAM in children requires a lobectomy because of poor sensitivity and very poor negative predictive value (60%) of the preoperative CT to determine distal adjacent lesions. A prospective study on a larger number of patients is required to confirm these observations.

### From dyspnea to diagnosis: a pediatric case report on an unexpected condition [^111n2hh9]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2025). Medium credibility.

4 Conclusion

This case emphasizes the need to maintain a high index of suspicion of primary immunodeficiencies in patients with atypical symptoms, pathogens, and treatment failures, even in previously healthy children. The knowledge of underlying immune pathology has critical implications for the therapeutic strategies and follow‐up management. We suggest incorporating immunologic evaluations, including the oxidative burst test, in the diagnostic workup for children presenting with otherwise unexplained diffuse parenchymal disease.

Flexible bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) in chILD syndrome — For patients with chILD syndrome, we suggest flexible bronchoscopy with BAL to exclude infection or airway abnormalities as possible causes of diffuse lung disease (DLD) (weak recommendation). Bronchoscopy with BAL is used to assess and sample the airways and alveoli and is the most commonly used invasive technique in patients with DLD because it is relatively safe, easily performed, and readily available. The primary benefit in chILD syndrome is to obtain specimens for microbiologic studies to exclude infection, while a recent guideline underscores the lack of specificity of BAL cellular constituents and the inability to use BAL cellular results as predictive of the course of an individual patient's illness.

Conclusions

Although children diagnosed with CPAM may do well with conservative management, our case report demonstrates that not all CPAMs are diagnosed prenatally. Development of symptomatic disease in adulthood is possible and should be considered when patients do not respond to medical management. Our patient is recovering well from surgery, with high hopes that he will return to his active life.

### The natural history of prenatally diagnosed congenital cystic lung lesions: long-term follow-up of 119 cases [^112t7goH]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2017). Low credibility.

Background

A paucity of evidence regarding the natural history of congenital pulmonary airway malformations (CPAMs) and pulmonary sequestration (PS) has resulted in a divergence in management strategy of asymptomatic cases.

Methods

We describe the long-term clinical course of 119 children diagnosed with these lesions treated at Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH). Cases were identified via the GOSH patient database. Study entry required the identification of a cystic lung lesion on prenatal ultrasound and confirmation of CPAM/PS on postnatal CT imaging. Patients followed up for at least 5 years were included.

Results

51 (43%) patients were managed surgically; 8 (6.7%) as an emergency during the neonatal period, 6 (5.1%) electively due to concerning features on CT scan, 20 (17%) following medical advice, 1 (0.8%) following a severe respiratory infection and in 5 (4.2%) the indication was unclear. The indication in 11 (9.2%) was recurrent respiratory infection and median age at surgery was 1.6 years (range 0.4 to 4.6 years). No cases of malignancy were identified on histological examination of resected lesions. 68 (57%) patients were managed conservatively for a median period of 9.9 years (range 5.2 years to 18 years). Seven (10%) were discharged, one was followed-up elsewhere (1.5%) and eight (11%) were lost to follow-up. In four patients (5.9%), the lesion resolved spontaneously. 52 (76%) continue to be followed-up and remain asymptomatic.

Conclusions

This is one of the largest case series documenting the natural history of CPAMs and PS following a prenatal diagnosis and demonstrates that conservative management is a reasonable option in selected cases.

### Sequestrations, congenital cystic adenomatoid malformations, and congenital lobar emphysema [^115qzgVm]. Seminars in Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

The respiratory system begins to develop at 3 weeks gestation, and aberrations in developmental processes may give rise to a group of structural abnormalities collectively referred to as bronchopulmonary foregut malformations (BPFMs). These lesions or anomalies may subsequently present in the newborn period as pulmonary parenchymal abnormalities in association with significant respiratory compromise. This article briefly reviews fetal lung development and then proceeds to delineate the characteristics, presentation, and surgical treatment of 3 of the more common BPFMs, those being sequestrations, congenital cystic adenomatoid malformations, and infantile lobar emphysema. The various types of BPFMs may occur in conjunction with one another or in association with other congenital anomalies, and these lesions should be managed with a thoughtful and aggressive surgical approach.

### Clinical assessment of pediatric patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma: a 30-year experience at a single institution [^115gjtd1]. World Journal of Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

According to the ATA management guidelines for children, BTT remains the treatment of choice for pediatric patients with DTC. Decision making regarding the surgical approach and the extent of surgery should strike a balance between the completeness of tumor removal and the quality of life of the patients. The results of this study show that comparable surgical outcomes may be achieved with lobectomy, and lobectomy may, hence, be considered for patients with limited disease, such as those with tumor size < 2 cm, no suspicious lymph nodes, intrathyroidal lesion, and no multifocal disease. Further studies are required to determine whether lobectomy is useful in clinical practice for pediatric patients with DTC.

### Uniportal video-assisted thoracoscopic anatomical resection of the right anterior pulmonary segment in a 10-year-old child with congenital pulmonary airway malformation [^1122rMDt]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Patient presentation

A 10-year-old girl visited the Department of Otolaryngology as an outpatient, having sensed a mass/swelling on the left floor of mouth for 2 weeks. A history of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), linked to very low preterm birthweight, was acknowledged. There was a cystic lesion on floor of mouth, confirmed by computed tomography (CT) of the neck. The cyst (1.5 × 3.9 cm) occupied left anterior sublingual space, but a right hilar cystic lung lesion (2.3 × 1.5 cm) was also identified. She was referred to our Department of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery to manage the lung lesion. On physical examination, the patient was asymptomatic and otherwise sound. Blood culture, oral culture, and urine culture were performed, and there was no growth of microorganisms. Therefore, no adjunctive antibiotics were administered. Chest X-ray again disclosed a cystic lesion and consolidation within right hilar region (Fig. 1 A). CT of the chest further defined the consolidation, situated in anterior segment of right upper lobe (RUL) and harboring an internal cystic space (2.4 cm) with air-fluid level. Overall findings suggested a congenital cystic growth complicated by pneumonia (Fig. 1 B, C).

### Management of a rare case of lymphangioleiomyomatosis complicated by recurrent pneumothorax [^115svEaU]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

A female of reproductive age presents to the emergency department with progressive dyspnoea due to pneumothorax. She has a history of lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) diagnosed by lung biopsy 15 years ago following incidental finding of pneumothorax.

LAM is a rare cystic lung disease affecting the lymphatic system, which most commonly affects women of childbearing age. It can be diagnosed via imaging or tissue biopsy (gold standard). Treatment can be difficult, and it often requires highly specialised care by pulmonologists and often confers significant limitations to patients' independence and quality of life. Family physicians are often part of multidisciplinary team to provide care to patients with rare chronic conditions.

### Rare presentation of pneumothorax in a young woman with underlying congenital pulmonary airway malformation [^117KNmkd]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

Background

Congenital pulmonary airway malformation (CPAM), which was previously known as congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation (CCAM), results from abnormalities of branching morphogenesis of the lung at various stages of development and may occur at different levels of the tracheobronchial tree. There is adenomatoid proliferation of bronchioles that form cysts instead of normal alveoli, which can result in malformation with single or multiple cysts of uniform or various sizes.

CPAM is a hamartomatous condition but can also be associated with malignancies. It is important to explore the family history of cancers and cystic lesions as it can be part of the familial pleuropulmonary blastoma syndrome. CPAM can be life-threatening if not treated timely and appropriately. Therefore, creating awareness among adult respiratory physicians can potentially avoid late or misdiagnosis. CPAM diagnoses can be particularly challenging and easily overlooked, as pneumothorax, haemoptysis and recurrent chest infections are common presentations from a wide range of aetiologies.

We review a case of a young woman who presented with pneumothorax associated with CPAM type 1.

Childhood interstitial lung disease (chILD) in infancy — technique for surgical lung biopsy: For patients with chILD syndrome who undergo surgical lung biopsy, we recommend that the biopsy be performed using VATS rather than open thoracotomy, if expertise is available (strong recommendation). The rationale states that lung biopsy via VATS has fewer surgical complications, a shorter operative time, and less pain than lung biopsy via open thoracotomy, while providing a similar diagnostic yield, and evidence derives from four single-center observational studies comparing VATS with open thoracotomy in patients with chILD syndrome.

### Should asymptomatic patients with congenital lung malformations undergo surgery? A decision analysis [^115U1h5o]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2023). Medium credibility.

1 BACKGROUND

Congenital lung malformations (CLM) comprise a spectrum of anatomical anomalies of the lungs and respiratory tree that include congenital pulmonary airway malformations (CPAM, previously known as congenital cystic adenomatoid malformations [CCAM]), bronchopulmonary sequestrations (BPS), bronchogenic cysts, and congenital lobar emphysema. The natural history of CLMs is less clear and extremely variable. Larger lesions can cause life‐threatening complications in the prenatal period, such as fetal hydrops, but smaller lesions may remain asymptomatic at birth with the potential to regress over time. With improvements in prenatal ultrasound image quality, most CLMs can be detected in the second trimester during pregnancy. The overall prevalence of CLMs has increased over the past two decades with a recent estimate of 1 in 2000–2500 live births. The majority of affected fetuses can survive until term, and delivery is usually uncomplicated.

The postnatal clinical presentation of CLM can range from respiratory distress at birth, necessitating immediate medical intervention, to an incidental finding on a chest radiograph later in life. Surgical resection of asymptomatic CLMs has been the preferred approach by most pediatric surgeons for decades to prevent long‐term complications, including pneumonia, pneumothorax, hemoptysis or hemothorax, and malignant development, leading to a lack of evidence regarding the long‐term outcomes in asymptomatic patients. However, affected children may remain asymptomatic beyond the neonatal period and well into adulthood; also, there is a lack of evidence supporting malignant degeneration of CLMs. Thus, expectant management has been proposed as an alternative approach to managing these children.

Existing research consists mainly of retrospective studies comparing short‐term outcomes of different treatments with limited sample sizes and follow‐up. This has led to a lack of evidence‐based consensus about the optimal postnatal management of prenatally‐diagnosed patients who remain asymptomatic during infancy. Moreover, due to the relatively low prevalence of CLMs and potential ethical problems, it is unlikely that randomized clinical trials will be performed to make standardized treatment recommendations that will optimize clinical outcomes for asymptomatic patients with CLMs. Thus, we sought to further evaluate the effectiveness of these two treatment strategies (surgical resection vs. expectant management) using a decision‐analytic model informed by the best literature‐based evidence.

### Conservative management of antenatally diagnosed cystic lung malformations [^117Y2rYv]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2014). Low credibility.

Aim

To review the outcome of all antenatally diagnosed conservatively managed congenital lung malformations (CLMs) managed at our centre.

Methods

All patients diagnosed antenatally with cystic lung malformations from 2001 to 2011, at a tertiary referral paediatric surgical centre practising a policy of conservative management of asymptomatic cases, were retrospectively reviewed. Data were collected from medical case notes and radiology reports. Ethical approval was obtained from our institutional research and development department.

Results

The complete records of 74 fetuses antenatally diagnosed with CLM were reviewed. There were 72 live births, at a median gestation of 39.6 weeks. Emergency lobectomy was performed in one symptomatic neonate. Elective lobectomies were performed at parental request in three asymptomatic infants, one of whom had a family history of synovial sarcoma. Two patients developed pneumonia in the affected lobe during early childhood and proceeded to lobectomy at the age of 3 years. One patient with a bronchopulmonary sequestration required embolisation for cyanotic episodes. The remaining 65 patients have been conservatively managed to date, and none have required hospital admission. Less than a quarter report mild respiratory symptoms such as cough or wheeze. Median follow-up is 5 years.

Conclusions

This retrospective cohort study of 74 consecutive CLMs diagnosed antenatally over a 10-year period demonstrates that most of these lesions will remain asymptomatic throughout childhood. Although the natural history of CLMs in later years remains to be elucidated, we hope that this report on medium-term outcomes will be useful to clinicians who undertake antenatal counselling and may inform the discussion on how best to manage these children.

### Treatment of congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation: should lobectomy always be performed? [^115p2166]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Although parenchyma-saving resection makes it possible to preserve the lung parenchyma, most surgeons are reluctant to perform it for congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation (CCAM) because it could also result in recurrent pulmonary infection or residual lesion. This study compared the early and late postoperative outcomes according to the extent of resection in CCAM patients to determine if the extent of resection would influence the short- and long-term results.

Methods

Between 1995 and 2006, 45 patients underwent surgical resection for CCAM. Ten patients received a segmentectomy and 2 a wedge resection (the parenchyma-saving group), and 32 received a lobectomy and 1 a pneumonectomy (the lobectomy group). A retrospective analysis was done to compare the early and late postoperative outcomes between two groups.

Results

No significant differences were observed for severity and duration of preoperative symptoms. No in-hospital or late deaths occurred. There were no significant differences in the incidence of early postoperative complications and late morbidities between the two groups. No significant differences were observed between the two groups for hospital length of stay and duration of chest tube placement.

Conclusions

The early and late outcomes were excellent even after parenchyma-saving resection in patients with CCAM. We suggest that parenchyma-saving resection can be safely performed in selected patients with a well-confined CCAM lesion and thereby avoiding pneumonectomy in children.

### Evidence-based review of treatment and follow up of pediatric patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma [^116rLYMa]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2006). Low credibility.

Childhood onset differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) is distinct from the adult-onset disease being more aggressive at the time of initial evaluation with a higher risk category for disease recurrence; however, it is ultimately less lethal. International groups have outlined consensus statements detailing follow up and management guidelines for adult DTC, but since disease progression and markers are significantly different in childhood DTC compared to adults, management protocols may differ. Unfortunately, there is no consensus regarding the means of follow up, timing and management strategy regarding pediatric DTC. We performed an evidence-based review of DTC in children targeted to address the following questions: What is the most appropriate initial treatment? What is the goal of thyroid hormone replacement management? What is the approach to follow-up of childhood DTC? and, How should tumor recurrence/persistence be assessed and treated? We conducted a literature search using PubMed, Cochrane databases, guidelines from various international groups, and studies pertaining to pediatric DTC management and outcome in order to answer these questions. We suggest a pre-set algorithm and approach for the management of children with DTC according to our review.

### Swyer-james-macLeod syndrome in a surgically treated child: a case report and brief literature review [^117Qfz9R]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Swyer-James-Macleod syndrome (SJMS) is a rare, complex disease characterized by unilateral hyperlucent lung or lobe owing to loss of pulmonary vasculature and alveolar hyperdistention. Treatment is generally conservative, and surgical management is rare. In fact, only 4 reports on surgically treated children with SJMS are available in the literature. We describe an 8-year-old patient with a history of recurrent respiratory infections since 2 months old. The patient presented with cough and dyspnea on effort. Chest radiograph showed hyperlucency and reduction of the right lung. Computed tomography revealed reduced volume and vasculature in the right lung, whereas pulmonary scintigraphy showed that 85% of ventilation and perfusion occurred in the left lung. Pulmonary function tests showed a forced expiratory volume in 1 second of 0.85 L (56% of expected value) and a forced vital capacity of 1.20 L (70% of expected value). The child underwent right pneumonectomy because of severe compromise of pulmonary function and recurrent respiratory infections. Histologic examination revealed panacinar emphysema and chronic bronchitis/bronchiolitis. At 6-month follow-up, the child showed improved symptoms and a forced expiratory volume in 1 second of 1.15 L (77% of expected value) and a forced vital capacity of 1.4 L (83% of expected value). This report shows that although rarely indicated, surgical treatment can improve quality of life and pulmonary function in SJMS.

### Congenital lung abnormality quantification by computed tomography: the CLAQ method [^116ed7yx]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2020). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Congenital lung abnormalities (CLA) are considered rare developmental disorders of the respiratory tract and pulmonary vascularization. In the past decades, an increase in the incidence of CLA has been observed, due to improved ultrasound technology and structured prenatal screening. 1 The most common abnormalities, in order of prevalence, are congenital pulmonary airway malformation (CPAM), bronchopulmonary sequestration (BPS), congenital lobar overinflation (CLO) — previously known as congenital lobar emphysema and bronchogenic cyst (BC). Quantitative prenatal measurements, such as the CPAM‐volume‐ratio, have been found to predict fetal hydrops and neonatal respiratory distress. 2 Postnatal predictive factors have not yet been identified, and to date, no consensus has been reached on the optimal management of CLA. 3 To close this gap, quantitative measurements may be of added value, to accurately describe disease extent. 4

Surgical resection is warranted for symptomatic CLA patients presenting with recurrent infections and respiratory distress, but the optimal management of asymptomatic patients is still being debated. 5, 6 Some authors propose a "wait and see" policy, while others advocate an operative approach in the first year of life for all cases. Arguments for elective surgery include avoiding the onset of symptoms and reducing the risk for malignant transformation. 7 In addition, the complication rate of elective surgery is believed to be lower than that of emergency surgery, 8 and early surgical resection may allow for compensatory lung growth and reduce parental anxiety. 9 Conversely, conservative management is supported by evidence that the risk associated with surgery exceeds the risk of symptom development, and prevents the perhaps unnecessary removal of functional lung tissue. Additionally, the possible regression with increasing age, 10 and the weak association with malignancy do not outweigh the surgical risks. 7, 11, 12 All aforementioned arguments are based on retrospective studies, "expert's opinion", or empiricism, but hard evidence is lacking. 3, 6

To determine the optimal management of CLA patients, we need to identify an objective postnatal outcome predictor. With this in mind, we have developed the congenital lung abnormality quantification (CLAQ) scoring method, to objectively characterize and quantify disease extent on chest computed tomography (CT) in CLA patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate the reproducibility of the CLAQ scoring method and assess its value as an outcome predictor.

### Massive pneumatic expansion of lymphatic vessel resulting in cystic lesions in the pulmonary parenchyma: a rare case of persistent interstitial pulmonary emphysema in a non-ventilated infant [^116BU1Zx]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

We report the case of 2-week-old female infant with cystic lung disease who presented with mild tachypnea and had no history of mechanical ventilation. Chest CT demonstrated multiple air-filled cystic lesions in right upper lobe, and the patient subsequently underwent a right upper lobectomy. Histology revealed cystic lesions located in the pulmonary parenchyma and showed that the lesions were lined by lymphatic endothelium and were communicating with dilated lymphatic vessels in the interstitium. Additionally, multinucleated foreign body giant cells were attached to the lumen of the cyst. On the basis of these findings, we considered this a case of persistent interstitial pulmonary emphysema (PIPE) with massive pneumatic expansion of the lymphatic vessels, resulting in cystic lesions with lymphatic endothelium in the pulmonary parenchyma. While PIPE is extremely rare in term non-ventilated infants, our case demonstrated that this disease should be added to the differential diagnosis of cystic lung diseases with lymphatic endothelium even in infants without mechanical ventilation. When cystic lesions and symptoms persist despite conservative treatment, open or thoracoscopic resection is an appropriate option for diagnosis and treatment.

### Hydatid cyst in heart and lung: a rare case with a 5-year follow-up [^1142rTmF]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

This report describes a male in his late 20s who presented with a 2-month history of recurrent haemoptysis and chest pain. A chronic infection, such as tuberculosis, was suspected. He had undergone surgical resection of an intrapericardial hydatid cyst in the past. His blood investigations showed peripheral eosinophilia, and his chest X-ray showed a cystic oval lesion in the left upper zone. A CT pulmonary angiogram revealed filling defects in the bilateral segmental and subsegmental arteries with a cystic lesion in the left upper lobe. Further workup, including bronchoalveolar lavage culture and MRI of the thorax, confirmed the diagnosis of a hydatid cyst of pulmonary echinococcosis. This case illustrates the presentation of multisystemic echinococcosis in a young male with no other risk factors, initially treated with surgical resection and antihelminthic therapy. The disease later recurred, which required prolonged medications, which brought the patient into remission.

### A unique case of pulmonary minimally invasive mucinous adenocarcinoma arising from atypical goblet cell hyperplasia in the bronchial epithelium of a 9-year-old girl [^1145F7eW]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Malignant pulmonary neoplasms are rare in pediatric patients. The rarity and nonspecific clinical manifestations pose challenges to accurate recognition and management. Recurrent pneumonia with nodular lesions on chest radiographs that fail to respond to medical treatment should raise suspicion of pulmonary malignancy. Primary pulmonary malignancies may present as ground‒glass opacities (GGOs), solid masses, or mixed nodules on chest computed tomography (CT). Early clinical suspicion of malignant pediatric pulmonary neoplasms can lead to timely surgical interventions, such as video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). A definitive diagnosis is established on the basis of histopathological findings.

Pulmonary adenocarcinoma is extremely rare in pediatric patients, and pulmonary mucinous adenocarcinoma is frequently associated with congenital pulmonary airway malformations (CPAM). Mucinous cell clusters and/or atypical goblet cell hyperplasia in CPAM are considered precursor lesions for pulmonary mucinous adenocarcinoma during childhood, and KRAS mutations may indicate potential malignant behavior. It is challenging to suspect primary mucinous adenocarcinoma in pediatric patients without congenital cystic lesions. Herein, we present a unique case of pulmonary minimally invasive mucinous adenocarcinoma harboring a KRAS mutation in a 9-year-old girl without CPAM and provide a literature review of its clinical, radiographic, and histopathological features.

Mimics of unusual lung infections in children

Hypersensitivity pneumonitis

Hypersensitivity pneumonitis, also previously known as extrinsic allergic alveolitis, is a complicated and heterogeneous interstitial lung disease caused by an excessive immune response to an inhaled antigen in susceptible individuals appearing as inflammation and/or fibrosis of the lung parenchyma and small airways. Hypersensitivity pneumonitis has a predilection for women and older individuals; however, it is the most frequent chronic interstitial lung disease in children. Although more than 200 sensitizing antigens have been identified, bird antigens are by far the most common causative antigens in children. Accurate diagnosis of hypersensitivity pneumonitis is difficult and necessitates a detailed exposure history, as well as a multidisciplinary clinical, histopathologic, and radiologic evaluation.

The diversity of clinical manifestations depends on the nature of the causal agent, the duration of exposure, and host factors. The disease can be classified as acute/inflammatory or chronic/fibrotic form. The acute/inflammatory form is denoted by a disease lasting < 6 months and is often reversible. In this form, typical symptoms are dyspnea, cough, and, less commonly, wheezing and weight loss. Chronic/fibrotic form is characterized by a disease lasting > 6 months and the presence of fibrotic changes on CT imaging or histology. In this form, typical symptoms are gradual respiratory failure with chronic dry cough and weight loss.

### Treatment of bronchogenic cyst surgical versus transbronchial drainage? [^111T6NtJ]. Journal of Bronchology & Interventional Pulmonology (2011). Low credibility.

Bronchogenic cysts are congenital abnormalities of the bronchial tree and present with a wide range of clinical and radiologic manifestations. Asymptomatic bronchogenic cysts may become symptomatic and produce complications with passage of time. Therefore, removal of the cyst is advised. We present a case that was diagnosed as asymptomatic bronchogenic cyst. Therapeutic drainage of cystic fluid through a bronchoscope was attempted, which led to rupture of the cyst and leakage of cystic fluid into the mediastinum and pleural space, leading to complications. Finally, thoracotomy was performed, and the bronchogenic cyst was surgically removed. After surgery, the patient recovered completely. It has been concluded that transbronchial aspiration of cystic fluid may be an ineffective procedure and may lead to complications and require surgical intervention.

### School-age structural and functional MRI and lung function in children following lung resection for congenital lung malformation in infancy [^115junRS]. Pediatric Radiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Congenital lung malformations, including congenital pulmonary airway malformation (CPAM), extra- and intralobar bronchopulmonary sequestration, congenital lobar and segmental emphysema, and bronchogenic cyst, are amongst the most frequent abnormalities detected in utero. With improved prenatal ultrasound, the incidence has seen a rise; however, congenital lung malformations remain a rare condition in the overall population. To date, the management of congenital lung malformations, such as CPAM, bronchopulmonary sequestration and the overlap of these two (hybrid lesions), is still controversial. For children symptomatic at birth, a surgical approach, such as lobectomy, segmentectomy or cyst removal, is widely accepted. However, the management of asymptomatic congenital lung malformations is controversial. Early elective resection of the malformations aims to prevent complications such as recurrent pulmonary infection, pneumothorax or malignancy. Early intervention is supported by the idea of compensatory growth of the remaining lung parenchyma after lung resection, resulting in physiological lung growth. However, it is still debated if the lung is capable of compensatory growth or primarily extends into the cavity. In case of compensatory growth, studies have suspected a potential for a structure-function dissociation, with an unequal growth of conducting airways and blood vessels in comparison to acinar tissue. It is especially unclear whether the expansion or growth of the lung results in balanced ventilation and perfusion. Long-term evolution of lung function as measured by conventional lung function tests is therefore controversial. The aim of this pilot study was to assess functionality of expanded lung tissue, using lung function tests and novel magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based functional methods to measure ventilation and perfusion.

### Clinical characteristics and etiologies of bronchiectasis in Korean children: a multicenter retrospective study [^115Fuzxw]. Respiratory Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Bronchiectasis is a chronic pulmonary disease characterized by progressive and irreversible bronchial dilatation. The aim of the present study was to investigate the etiologies and clinical features of bronchiectasis in Korean children.

Methods

We performed a retrospective review of the medical records for children diagnosed with bronchiectasis between 2000 and 2017 at 28 secondary or tertiary hospitals in South Korea.

Results

A total of 387 cases were enrolled. The mean age at diagnosis was 9.2 ± 5.1 years and 53.5% of the patients were boys. The most common underlying cause of bronchiectasis was preexisting respiratory infection (55.3%), post-infectious bronchiolitis obliterans (14.3%), pulmonary tuberculosis (12.3%), and heart diseases (5.6%). Common initial presenting symptoms included chronic cough (68.0%), recurrent pneumonia (36.4%), fever (31.1%), and dyspnea (19.7%). The most predominantly involved lesions were left lower lobe (53.9%), right lower lobe (47.1%) and right middle lobe (40.2%). No significant difference was observed in the distribution of these involved lesions by etiology. The forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV 1) levels were lowest in cases with interstitial lung disease-associated bronchiectasis, followed by those with recurrent aspiration and primary immunodeficiency.

Conclusions

Bronchiectasis should be strongly considered in children with chronic cough and recurrent pneumonia. Long-term follow-up studies on pediatric bronchiectasis are needed to further clarify the prognosis and reduce the disease burden in these patients.

### Imaging of congenital cystic lung lesions [^111PJcvh]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

Congenital cystic lung lesions are a rare but clinically significant group of anomalies, including congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation (CCAM), pulmonary sequestration, congenital lobar emphysema (CLE) and bronchogenic cysts. These conditions can all present on imaging studies as air or fluid filled cysts. Widespread use of antenatal ultrasound has led to increased detection of infants with congenital thoracic abnormalities in utero, resulting in a better understanding of the natural history of many of these lesions and also allowing provision to be made for delivery and postnatal management. More recently antenatal magnetic resonance (MR) imaging has provided further information on the nature of many of these lesions and helped to differentiate them from extrathoracic abnormalities such as congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH), which is important in parental counselling. Many children with congenital cystic lung lesions will present with symptoms resulting in the need for prompt diagnosis and treatment and imaging has an essential role in the management of these children. Some congenital lung lesions are treated surgically, whilst others are managed conservatively.

### Growing PET positive nodule in a patient with histoplasmosis: case report [^116KTYa8]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

After three months, a follow up CT scan confirmed excision of the right lung nodule but demonstrated enlargement of the left sided lung nodule from 1.7 cm to 3 cm (Figure 2). Growth in a nodule with F-18 FDG uptake raised concern regarding cancer despite the known history of pulmonary histoplasmosis. The risks and benefits of operative resection versus watchful waiting were discussed with an interdisciplinary team, the patient, and his family.

Figure 2
Chest CT scan showing a 1.7 cm left lower lobe nodule (left), as well as, a three months follow up Chest CT scan demonstrating enlargement of the left lower lobe nodule from 1.7 cm to 3 cm (right).

The patient underwent a left lower lobectomy. Pathology revealed necrotizing granulomata resembling that seen in the prior biopsy; visible fungal elements consistent with histoplasmosis were visible upon silver staining. Interestingly, operative fungal cultures were negative, suggesting the growth in the lesion was likely from host immune response, not from progression of infection. The formulation of the patient's itraconazole was changed to an oral solution, 200 mg once a day for an additional three months. A follow up CT scan at one year duration has not shown any recurrence of disease.

### Managing chronic cough as a symptom in children and management algorithms: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^114LSeQT]. Chest (2020). High credibility.

Anatomical airway abnormalities and cough in children — prevalence and uncertainty: Chronic cough is common in children with airway lesions, with reports of up to 75% of children with tracheomalacia related to vascular anomaly having persistent cough at presentation. Studies examining PBB and tracheo-bronchomalacia found coughing rates of up to 74% retrospectively and 68% prospectively, with 53% in the prospective control group. Children with airway malacia are often misdiagnosed with asthma, systematic reviews indicate it remains unclear if one condition is antecedent to the other, and although persistent cough is listed as an indication for FB, its role in those with isolated chronic cough has yet to be defined prospectively.

### Official American Thoracic Society technical standards: flexible airway endoscopy in children [^1156J9V6]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

American Thoracic Society flexible airway endoscopy in children — Clinical scope and specialized procedures notes that flexible airway endoscopy (FAE) in young children was first described in 1978 (1) and is now widely used to assess and treat pediatric respiratory disease; the flexible bronchoscope allows for functional and anatomical examination of the upper and lower airways, and FAE and specialized procedures including bronchoalveolar lavage are important for diagnosing and treating problems such as congenital or acquired airway anomalies, persistent or recurrent pulmonary infiltrates, community-acquired or ventilator-associated pneumonia, pulmonary infections in immunocompromised hosts, and pulmonary hemorrhage. Specialized interventions including bronchoscopic intubation, biopsies, airway dilatation, airway stenting, and removal of plugs and clots can all be performed via FAE in children in the appropriate setting and with appropriate indication. The current American Thoracic Society guidelines for FAE in children were published over 20 years ago (2), and advances in care have rendered these guidelines insufficient.

### First time wheezing in a 2-year-old [^113q4mwd]. Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Pediatric patients with respiratory signs and symptoms who are found to be wheezing present a diagnostic dilemma to pediatricians. The majority of these cases are diagnosed as some degree of reactive airway disease, either as viral bronchiolitis or asthma. In this scenario, a patient with wheezing was initially given 2 courses of appropriate antibiotics on the basis of the duration and concurrence of other symptoms. However, he was subsequently referred to a pediatric pulmonologist for further workup after failure to improve and persistent oxygen saturations in the low-to-mid 90s. More extensive testing was completed by the pediatric pulmonologist, in addition to a short hospital admission. A rigid bronchoscopy was eventually completed, which revealed small pieces of partially digested material. Although his persistent cough resolved, his saturations continued to be suboptimal. A chest computed tomography scan with contrast was then completed, which eventually led to his diagnosis and appropriate treatment and resolution of his symptoms.

Results

There were 15 patients in this group (nine males and six females). Age ranges from 4.3 to 96.0 months (median, 7.7 months). Weight ranged from 7.0 to 27.0 kg (median, 9.5 kg). Thirteen cases of CLM were diagnosed using prenatal ultrasound and chest CT examination within 3 months after birth, including seven cases of CPAM and six cases of ILS. Owing to recurrent respiratory tract infections, two patients were diagnosed using chest CT, including one case of CPAM and one case of ILS. Lesions in six cases were located on the right S10, whereas those on the left S10 were found in nine. The lesion diameters of the lesions range from 2.8 to 5.9 cm (median, 4.3 cm). Six children underwent surgery following rehabilitation for recurring clinical respiratory symptoms (cough in four cases and wheezing in two). Nine were asymptomatic, but their parents requested active surgical treatment (Table 1). The surgery was uneventful for all 15 patients. The surgical time was from 57 to 125 min, with a median of 80 min, whereas the intra-operative bleeding ranged from 5 to 20 ml, with a median of 10 ml. In this study, nine patients underwent segmentectomy of the left S10, and five underwent segmentectomy of the right S10. One child was scheduled to undergo a segmentectomy of the right S10. Furthermore, when the lesion was completely excised, the surrounding tissue of S6 was very thin, and blood flow was inadequate due to large cysts in the lesion compressing the adjacent lung segment. Therefore, segmentectomy of the right S10 and partial wedge resection of the right S6 were performed (Fig. 2 C F). The postoperative drainage tube indwelling lasted 2–4 d, with a median of 3 d, whereas the postoperative hospitalization time lasted 4–7 d, with a median of 5 d. These patients had no intraoperative conversions, surgical mortalities, or major complications. Three patients were diagnosed with subcutaneous emphysema. After conservative observation, the subcutaneous emphysema resolved, and no pneumothorax or bronchopleural fistula occurred (Fig. 3). Table 1 summarizes the operative and postoperative outcomes.

### Pediatric congenital lung malformations: imaging guidelines and recommendations [^112KGwh6]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Congenital lung malformations are a spectrum of developmental anomalies comprised of malformations of the lung parenchyma, airways, and vasculature. Imaging assessment plays a pivotal role in the initial diagnosis, management, and follow-up evaluation of congenital lung malformations in the pediatric population. However, there is currently a lack of practical imaging guidelines and recommendations for the diagnostic imaging assessment of congenital lung malformations in infants and children. This article reviews the current evidence regarding the imaging evaluation of congenital lung malformations and provides up-to-date imaging recommendations for pediatric congenital lung malformations.

### A young child with a history of wheeze [^115rF5bp]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Case study
The parents of a 3 year old boy have come to see their family doctor about their son whose recurrent episodes of wheeze and respiratory symptoms are causing concern. They are frustrated that no-one seems able to give them a clear diagnosis, and worried because the treatment they have been given is not controlling his symptoms. They would like a referral to a specialist to see if they can get some answers.
Looking back through the records, the first episode of wheeze was at the age of 6 months. This was diagnosed as bronchiolitis and resulted in a brief admission. He had one further admission the following winter that was labelled as 'viral associated wheeze', and two subsequent attendances at the emergency department, on the last occasion being told that he had 'asthma'. In addition there are six primary care consultations for 'wheeze' or 'chest infections'. These episodes have been variously treated with bronchodilators, steroids (inhaled and oral) and/or antibiotics — none of which have had any convincing effect.

He was a normal full term delivery and thrived well from birth. Mother had hay fever as a teenager, and father smokes (though 'never in the house')

A clinical case, such as this 3-year old boy with recurrent wheeze, raises many questions that need to be explored in order to address parental concerns and manage the child's condition. The boy is thriving, height and weight just above the 50th centile.

Discussion

The pathogenesis of BPS is poorly understood. The most widely accepted embryologic theory is that BPS originates early in the pseudo-glandular stage of lung development (5 to 17 weeks of gestation), prior to separation of the aortic and pulmonary circulations. This would explain the wide spectrum of pathology observed, including the connections to the systemic circulation, the presence of separate visceral pleura in ELS or lack thereof in ILS, the occurrence of hybrid lesions with features of BPS and CPAM, and the occasional associations with bronchogenic cysts or connections to the foregut, as well as associated anomalies such as congenital diaphragmatic hernia. ILS is four times more common than ELS. ILS presents late in childhood or adolescence with recurrent pulmonary infection while ELS more commonly presents in newborns with respiratory distress, cyanosis, and infection. The most common location of ILS is in the posterior basal segments of the lung and nearly two third appearing in the left lung. Associated congenital anomalies are uncommon in ILS.

Mechanical separation from the rest of the organ by compression from vascular structures, traction by aberrant systemic vessels, or inadequate pulmonary blood flow is another postulate. However, this does not completely explain all types of lesions, specifically bronchopulmonary foregut malformation.

Clinical manifestation of BPS is variable and depends upon the type, size, and location of the lesion. Most cases are asymptomatic. If symptomatic, BPS usually presents with respiratory distress in the neonatal period. ILS or hybrid forms often present in adolescence or adulthood, with infection. ELS is less likely to get infected and is diagnosed incidentally on imaging. The differential diagnoses of pulmonary sequestration include persistent pneumonia, lung abscess, congenital pulmonary airway malformation, bronchogenic cyst, pulmonary arteriovenous malformation and Scimitar syndrome. Symptomatic patients are ideally treated with surgical excision which is curative and associated with minimal morbidity. The options include lobectomy or segmental resection with or without preoperative embolization of feeding vessels. In any case, CT chest (additional 3D reconstructed images of the anomalous arteries can be helpful, although not a necessity) or Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) must be performed beforehand to confirm the diagnosis, identify the anomalous arterial supply and venous drainage, and assist surgical planning.

Surgical resection is advocated for most of these lesions because of the likelihood of recurrent infection and the possibility of haemorrhage and ILS often requires lobectomy. Although thoracoscopic resection has been reported with low morbidity and mortality, open thoracotomy for safe isolation and division of the anomalous systemic feeding arteries is recommended to prevent complications.

### Congenital pulmonary airway malformation: advances and controversies [^111Vc8r7]. The Lancet: Child & Adolescent Health (2018). Medium credibility.

Advances in antenatal screening have provided evidence that the prevalence of congenital pulmonary airway malformation is higher than previously thought. This means that, on a global scale, more congenital pulmonary airway malformations will be diagnosed and seen by clinicians across many different specialties. This increase poses new controversies and challenges for clinicians in terms of prenatal and postnatal management. Important and exciting research has begun to emerge in the past decade. This Review describes current understanding of the disease, the latest surgical developments, and highlights management issues and controversies, including the rationale and timing of surgical intervention, the choice of surgical approach, and long-term functional outcomes. In doing so, we attempt to provide a balanced management algorithm for readers.

### Bronchiolitis… [^111SLgLY]. Wikipedia (2004). Low credibility.

Bronchiolitis is inflammation of the small airways also known as the bronchioles in the lungs. Acute bronchiolitis is caused by a viral infection, usually affecting children younger than two years of age. Symptoms may include fever, cough, runny nose or rhinorrhea, and wheezing. More severe cases may be associated with nasal flaring, grunting, or respiratory distress. If the child has not been able to feed properly due to the illness, signs of dehydration may be present. Chronic bronchiolitis is more common in adults and has various causes, one of which is bronchiolitis obliterans. Often when people refer to bronchiolitis, they are referring to acute bronchiolitis in children. Acute bronchiolitis is usually the result of viral infection by respiratory syncytial virus or human rhinovirus. Diagnosis is generally based on symptoms.

Tests such as a chest X-ray or viral testing are not routinely needed, but may be used to rule out other diseases. About 10% to 30% of children under the age of two years are affected by bronchiolitis at some point in time. It commonly occurs in the winter season in the Northern Hemisphere. It is the leading cause of hospitalizations in those less than one year of age in the United States. The risk of death among those who are admitted to hospital is extremely low at about 1%. Outbreaks of the condition were first described in the 1940s. Signs and symptoms Bronchiolitis typically presents in children under two years old and is characterized by symptoms of a respiratory illness. Signs of the disease include:

- fever
- rhinorrhea
- cough
- wheeze
- **mild tachypnea or increased breathing Some signs of severe disease include**: These symptoms can develop over one to three days. Crackles or wheeze are typical findings on listening to the chest with a stethoscope.

Wheezes can occasionally be heard without a stethoscope. The child may also experience apnea, or brief pauses in breathing, but this can occur due to many conditions that are not just bronchiolitis. After the acute illness, it is common for the airways to remain sensitive for several weeks, leading to recurrent cough and wheeze. Causes Bronchiolitis is most commonly caused by respiratory syncytial virus. Other agents that cause this illness include, but are not limited to, human metapneumovirus, influenza, parainfluenza, coronavirus, adenovirus, rhinovirus and mycoplasma.

Risk factors Children are at an increased risk for progression to severe respiratory disease if they have any of the following additional risk factors:

- Preterm infant
- Younger age at onset of illness
- Congenital heart disease
- Immunodeficiency
- Chronic lung disease
- Neurological disorders
- Tobacco smoke exposure. Diagnosis The diagnosis is typically made by a provider through clinical history and physical exam. Chest X-ray is sometimes useful to exclude bacterial pneumonia, but not indicated in routine cases. Chest x-ray may also be useful in people with impending respiratory failure. Additional testing such as blood cultures, complete blood count, and electrolyte analyses are not recommended for routine use although may be useful in children with multiple comorbidities or signs of sepsis or pneumonia. Electrolyte analyses may be performed if there is concern for dehydration.

### Pneumonia [^1145TpAm]. Wikipedia (2002). Low credibility.

Pneumonia is usually caused by infection with viruses or bacteria, and less commonly by other microorganisms. Identifying the responsible pathogen can be difficult. Diagnosis is often based on symptoms and physical examination. Chest X-rays, blood tests, and culture of the sputum may help confirm the diagnosis. The disease may be classified by where it was acquired, such as community- or hospital-acquired or healthcare-associated pneumonia. Treatment depends on the underlying cause. Pneumonia believed to be due to bacteria is treated with antibiotics. If the pneumonia is severe, the affected person is generally hospitalized. Oxygen therapy may be used if oxygen levels are low. Most patients had no detectable pathogens in their sample, and unexpectedly, respiratory viruses were detected more frequently than bacteria. Specifically, 23% had one or more viruses, 11% had one or more bacteria, 3% had both bacterial and viral pathogens, and 1% had a fungal or mycobacterial infection.

"The most common pathogens were human rhinovirus, influenza virus, and Streptococcus pneumoniae". Exposure to birds is associated with Chlamydia psittaci; farm animals with Coxiella burnetti; aspiration of stomach contents with anaerobic organisms; and cystic fibrosis with Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. Streptococcus pneumoniae is more common in the winter, and it should be suspected in persons aspirating a large number of anaerobic organisms. Parasites A variety of parasites can affect the lungs, including Toxoplasma gondii, Strongyloides stercoralis, Ascaris lumbricoides, and Plasmodium malariae. These organisms typically enter the body through direct contact with the skin, ingestion, or via an insect vector. Mechanisms Pneumonia frequently starts as an upper respiratory tract infection that moves into the lower respiratory tract. It is a type of pneumonitis.

The normal flora of the upper airway give protection by competing with pathogens for nutrients. In the lower airways, reflexes of the glottis, actions of complement proteins and immunoglobulins are important for protection. Microaspiration of contaminated secretions can infect the lower airways and cause pneumonia. The progress of pneumonia is determined by the virulence of the organism; the amount of organism required to start an infection; and the body's immune response against the infection. Bacteria can also spread via the blood. Once in the lungs, bacteria may invade the spaces between cells and between alveoli, where the macrophages and neutrophils attempt to inactivate the bacteria. The neutrophils also release cytokines, causing a general activation of the immune system. This leads to the fever, chills, and fatigue common in bacterial pneumonia.

The neutrophils, bacteria, and fluid from surrounding blood vessels fill the alveoli, resulting in the consolidation seen on chest X-ray. Viral Viruses may reach the lung by a number of different routes. Respiratory syncytial virus is typically contracted when people touch contaminated objects and then touch their eyes or nose. Other viral infections occur when contaminated airborne droplets are inhaled through the nose or mouth. Once in the upper airway, the viruses may make their way into the lungs, where they invade the cells lining the airways, alveoli, or lung parenchyma. Diagnosis Pneumonia is typically diagnosed based on a combination of physical signs and often a chest X-ray. In recent years, however, the role of lung ultrasonography has gained prominence, with substantial evidence demonstrating that, in expert hands, it surpasses radiography in accuracy. In adults with normal vital signs and a normal lung examination, the diagnosis is unlikely.
