---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which pathogen or condition is most likely responsible for dysuria and increased urinary frequency in a 25-year-old woman with nitrite-negative urinalysis and urine microscopy findings as shown in figure A, and to choose among E. coli, S. saprophyticus, acute tubular necrosis, and renal calculi. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pretest probability given the classic symptoms in a young woman. Then, I should verify what the negative nitrite and positive pyuria on microscopy imply diagnostically. Next, I will review the epidemiology and microbiology of uropathogens, especially E. coli versus S. saprophyticus, and check whether nitrite negativity changes the leading diagnosis. After that, I need to consider and exclude noninfectious alternatives like acute tubular necrosis and nephrolithiasis. Finally, I will synthesize the most likely diagnosis and briefly note management implications without overstepping into treatment specifics.

> Let me first confirm the clinical syndrome and pretest probability. In a healthy, sexually active young woman with acute dysuria and urinary frequency, the likelihood of acute uncomplicated cystitis is high, and the combination of dysuria and frequency without vaginal discharge or irritation raises the probability of UTI to more than 90% based on history alone, which anchors a high pretest probability here [^115Pb52w] [^11549KRB].

> Wait, let me verify the significance of the laboratory findings. A negative nitrite test does not rule out UTI, particularly early in infection or with organisms that reduce nitrate slowly, whereas the presence of pyuria on microscopy supports a urinary tract inflammatory process and strengthens the case for infection when symptoms are present. Guidelines emphasize that pyuria with acute urinary symptoms is consistent with acute bacterial cystitis even when nitrites are absent [^113C4q31] [^112yE1He] [^113jyM3S].

> I will now examine the microbiology. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should confirm the leading uropathogens and their relative frequencies. Escherichia coli accounts for roughly 86% of acute uncomplicated cystitis in young women, whereas Staphylococcus saprophyticus accounts for about 4%, with other gram-negatives making up the remainder; this epidemiology alone makes E. coli the most likely pathogen in this scenario [^114UNutx].

> But wait, what if the negative nitrite points away from E. coli? Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought nitrite negativity might favor S. saprophyticus, but that would be misleading; S. saprophyticus is actually a poor reducer of nitrate and typically yields nitrite-negative urines, so a nitrite-negative result does not help distinguish S. saprophyticus from E. coli and does not overturn E. coli's overwhelming predominance in this age group, especially when pyuria is present and symptoms are classic [^114UNutx].

> Next, I should review and exclude noninfectious alternatives. Acute tubular necrosis presents with acute kidney injury and a different clinical context, not isolated dysuria and frequency, so it is not consistent with this presentation. Similarly, nephrolithiasis can cause dysuria and frequency but would typically bring flank pain, hematuria, and different sediment findings, and guidelines frame urinalysis in stone disease differently than in acute cystitis, making calculi less likely here given the absence of those features and the presence of pyuria pointing to infection [^111hMgPh].

> Let me synthesize. The combination of classic acute cystitis symptoms in a young woman, the presence of pyuria on microscopy, and the epidemiologic dominance of E. coli together support E. coli as the most likely cause, with the negative nitrite simply reflecting the limited sensitivity of nitrite testing rather than shifting the pathogen profile toward S. saprophyticus or a noninfectious etiology [^115Pb52w] [^113C4q31] [^114UNutx].

> Final answer: A. E. coli infection [^114UNutx].

---

The most likely cause of dysuria and frequency in a 25-year-old woman with negative nitrites and pyuria on microscopy is **E. coli infection** [^114UNutx]. Nitrite negativity is common in early or low-bacterial-load E. coli UTIs, and pyuria supports infection [^112yE1He] [^1173wmU7]. S. saprophyticus is less likely because it is a rare pathogen and typically presents in sexually active adolescent girls [^114UNutx]; acute tubular necrosis and renal calculi do not match the clinical picture [^notfound].

---

## Analysis of urinalysis findings

- **Nitrite negativity**: Nitrites are produced when bacteria reduce dietary nitrates, typically requiring ≥ 4 hours in the bladder [^1116DtDy]. Early or low-bacterial-load infections may be nitrite-negative, especially with E. coli [^112yE1He].

- **Pyuria**: The presence of WBCs indicates urinary tract inflammation, most often due to bacterial infection [^113C4q31].

- **Bacteriuria**: Visible bacteria on microscopy further support infection, even if nitrites are absent [^1146S4Vh].

---

## Differential diagnosis

| **Option** | **Rationale for likelihood** | **Rationale against likelihood** |
|-|-|-|
| E. coli infection | Most common uropathogen (≈ 86%) [^114UNutx]; nitrite-negative UTIs are common early or with low bacterial load [^1116DtDy] | None significant |
| S. saprophyticus infection | Less common (≈ 4%) [^114UNutx]; more often in adolescent girls | Rare in this age group; no distinct epidemiologic risk cited |
| Acute tubular necrosis | Presents with oliguria/anuria, rising creatinine, muddy brown casts | No renal failure features described |
| Renal calculi | Hematuria, flank pain, colic | No hematuria or flank pain reported |

---

## Clinical reasoning

- **E. coli**: The most common cause of uncomplicated cystitis in young women; nitrite-negative results are expected early or with low bacterial load, and pyuria supports the diagnosis [^114UNutx] [^1116DtDy].

- **S. saprophyticus**: Less likely due to rarity and lack of epidemiologic risk in this case [^114UNutx].

- **Acute tubular necrosis**: Inconsistent with the absence of renal failure features [^notfound].

- **Renal calculi**: Inconsistent with the absence of hematuria or flank pain [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

The most likely cause is **E. coli infection**. Management should follow standard uncomplicated cystitis protocols, with empiric antibiotics guided by local resistance patterns and patient factors [^116D2UjH].

Introduction

Urinalysis by dipstick and/or midstream urine culture (MSU) is the first investigation of the patient presenting with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). Negative results are usually assumed to exclude infection and diagnoses such as overactive bladder (OAB) depend on negative tests. The MSU is still considered the gold standard diagnostic test for UTI. It relies on isolating 10⁵ cfu mL⁻¹ of a known urinary pathogen, using aerobic culture with a Enterobacteriaceae -selective media. This was first described by Kass after studying patients with chills, fever, flank pain and dysuria. Kass never claimed to define a threshold for use with "cystitis", i.e. frequency/dysuria. However, 10⁵ cfu mL⁻¹ has been widely adopted. The dipstick has been validated against a standard of 10⁵ cfu mL⁻¹ of a known urinary pathogen.

In fact, these urinalysis methods are not sensitive and are incapable of excluding UTI. Effort is being made to find improved urinalysis techniques to detect UTI, but currently the best performing method is microscopy of a fresh unspun, unstained, clean-catch specimen of urine in a counting chamber to enumerate the white cells.

Our past reliance on dipstick analysis and culture to diagnose UTI has now been rejected in the literature, we should therefore re-examine our understanding of the symptoms and signs involved in LUTS.

The analysis of symptoms presents different challenges to the measurement of change over time, when assessing treatment outcomes. Well-known validated scores of LUTS such as the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire (ICIQ), the Incontinence Quality of Life Questionnaire (ICI-QOL) and Female Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms (F-LUTS) are used to assess the impact of incontinence. They have performed well in measuring the effects of treatments in clinical trials. Their utility in single, cross-sectional analyses is less assured because they use adjectival scaling such as "bothersomeness". People differ greatly in their semantic interpretation of adjectives. In longitudinal studies, the potential error from this variance can be avoided by the normalisation of within subject changes. This option is available to neither cross-sectional studies, nor to data collected at the time of diagnostic assessment. Additionally, scores such as the ICIQ were validated in patients after UTI had been excluded on the evidence of urine culture. Our interest lies in the symptoms associated with reliable indicators of UTI.

### Does this woman have an acute uncomplicated urinary tract infection? [^115Pb52w]. JAMA (2002). Excellent credibility.

Context

Symptoms suggestive of acute urinary tract infection (UTI) constitute one of the most common reasons for women to visit clinicians. Although the clinical encounter typically involves taking a history and performing a physical examination, the diagnostic accuracy of the clinical assessment for UTI remains uncertain.

Objective

To review the accuracy and precision of history taking and physical examination for the diagnosis of UTI in women.

Data Sources

We conducted a MEDLINE search for articles published from 1966 through September 2001 and manually reviewed bibliographies, 3 commonly used clinical skills textbooks, and contacted experts in the field.

Study Selection

Studies were included if they contained original data on the accuracy or precision of history or physical examination for diagnosing acute uncomplicated UTI in women. One author initially screened titles and abstracts found by our search. Nine of 464 identified studies met inclusion criteria.

Data Extraction

Two authors independently abstracted data from the included studies. Disagreements were resolved by discussion and consensus with a third author.

Data Synthesis

Four symptoms and 1 sign significantly increased the probability of UTI: dysuria (summary positive likelihood ratio [LR], 1.5; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2–2.0), frequency (LR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.1–3.0), hematuria (LR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.3–2.9), back pain (LR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.2–2.1), and costovertebral angle tenderness (LR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.1–2.5). Four symptoms and 1 sign significantly decreased the probability of UTI: absence of dysuria (summary negative LR, 0.5; 95% CI, 0.3–0.7), absence of back pain (LR, 0.8; 95% CI, 0.7–0.9), history of vaginal discharge (LR, 0.3; 95% CI, 0.1–0.9), history of vaginal irritation (LR, 0.2; 95% CI, 0.1–0.9), and vaginal discharge on examination (LR, 0.7; 95% CI, 0.5–0.9). Of all individual diagnostic signs and symptoms, the 2 most powerful were history of vaginal discharge and history of vaginal irritation, which significantly decreased the likelihood of UTI when present (LRs, 0.3 and 0.2, respectively). One study examined combinations of symptoms, and the resulting LRs were more powerful (24.6 for the combination of dysuria and frequency but no vaginal discharge or irritation). One study of patients with recurrent UTI found that self-diagnosis significantly increased the probability of UTI (LR, 4.0).

Conclusions

In women who present with 1 or more symptoms of UTI, the probability of infection is approximately 50%. Specific combinations of symptoms (eg, dysuria and frequency without vaginal discharge or irritation) raise the probability of UTI to more than 90%, effectively ruling in the diagnosis based on history alone. In contrast, history taking, physical examination, and dipstick urinalysis are not able to reliably lower the posttest probability of disease to a level where a UTI can be ruled out when a patient presents with 1 or more symptoms.

Typical course and comorbidities — IC/BPS "is most commonly diagnosed in individuals over 40", and in European studies "the mean age is older than is typical for the US". On presentation, "A history of a recent culture-proven urinary tract infection (UTI) can be identified on presentation in 18–36% of women, although subsequent cultures are negative". Early in the disease, "Initially it is not uncommon for patients to report a single symptom such as dysuria, frequency, or pain, with subsequent progression to multiple symptoms", and "Symptom flares, during which symptoms suddenly intensify for several hours, days, or weeks, are not uncommon". Additionally, "There is a high rate of prior pelvic surgery (especially hysterectomy) and levator ani pain in women with IC/BPS, suggesting that trauma or other local".

### Office-based urinalysis: a comprehensive review [^113jyM3S]. American Family Physician (2022). Medium credibility.

Comprehensive urinalysis involves inspection of the urine, dipstick chemical analysis, and microscopy and can be performed in the office setting. When testing for urinary tract infection, midstream urine should be collected using the clean-catch technique. A urine collection bag specimen can be used for clinically stable febrile infants with suspected urinary tract infection; however, the presence of leukocyte esterase or nitrites warrants more invasive urine collection. Urine specific gravity shows hydration status. Urinary pH levels can indicate diet, metabolism, or the presence of stones. Bilirubin and urobilinogen may suggest hepatobiliary disease or hemolysis. Glucosuria often indicates uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, and ketones suggest illness and inadequate nutrition. Hematuria on dipstick testing can be confirmed in the office using a spun urine sample. Proteinuria on dipstick testing should be followed by a quantitative test such as a spot urine albumin/creatinine ratio. In patients with symptoms of a urinary tract infection, the presence of nitrites is more specific for bacterial infection, and a positive leukocyte esterase result may occur from inflammation and infection. Asymptomatic bacteriuria is often unnecessarily treated in older patients. Without symptoms of urinary tract infection, urine culture is useful only in pregnancy and preparation for endoscopic urologic procedures.

RESULTS

Search Results and Study Details

A total of 1391 citations were retrieved by our search, including 15 duplicates removed prior to screening. Of these, 65 full-text studies were eligible for inclusion following title and abstract review and 5 randomized clinical trials were included (Fig. 1). Interrater agreement for study inclusion was excellent at 0.97. Four studies were conducted in Europe, and one was conducted in Pakistan.

Flow diagram of study selection.

Characteristics of Included Patients

Four studies, included adult women over the age of 18 while one studyincluded women over the age of 15. Upper age limits ranged from 50 to 70 years, with one studyhaving no upper age limit (Table 1). UTIs were generally defined as a constellation of typical symptoms (i.e. dysuria, frequency, urgency, and suprapubic/lower abdominal pain). One studyincluded individuals with self-diagnosed symptomatic cystitis if they had urine dipstick results positive for nitrites, leukocyte esterase, or both. Four studies, excluded patients with upper UTI signs (i.e. fever and back pain), pregnancy, diabetes, prior urological interventions, immunosuppressive states, urinary catheterization, recent UTI, current antibiotic or NSAID use, or contraindications to study drugs. Four studies, included baseline urine culture results at the time of inclusion, though culture results were not used as eligibility criteria (Table 1). The share of patients with positive urine cultures at the time of inclusion ranged from 67 to 86% in the NSAID groups and 64 to 80% in the antibiotic groups (Table 1).

### Diagnostic value of symptoms and signs for identifying urinary tract infection in older adult outpatients: systematic review and meta-analysis [^11741p3H]. The Journal of Infection (2018). Low credibility.

We obtained a number of conflicting results for estimates of the same symptom in relation to UTI. One point estimate for urinary incontinence in the summary ROC plot was a distinct outlier. Incontinence was described in six different ways by included studies; including "self-reported", "medical diagnosis of incontinence" and "incontinence (excluding stress)". The way in which incontinence was defined by the outlying study, and the potential impact of this on the point estimate is unclear.

Daley et al.found flank pain to be a predictor of UTI, whilst Juthani-Mehta et al.did not. There was also discrepancy between these two studies in their estimates for change in the character of urine and change in the voiding pattern. The reason for the difference in results between the studies is uncertain. The studies had similar prevalence of infection, study setting, age of participants, exclusion criteria and reference standard.

Comparison with existing guidelines

A decision aid within SIGN guideline 88 supplementary material, aims to guide clinicians in managing older patients with fever. The aid suggests that in the absence of symptoms indicative of respiratory, gastrointestinal, or skin or soft tissue infection, two or more of the following symptoms suggest that UTI is likely: dysuria, urgency, frequency, urinary incontinence, shaking/chills, flank/suprapubic pain, frank haematuria and new onset or worsening or pre-existing confusion or agitation. However, the findings from our review does not support the use of some of these symptoms. We did not find urgency to be predictive of UTI; nor did we find dysuria, frequency, incontinence or haematuria to predict UTI in women. However, only one of the studies in our review assessed the diagnostic use of combinations of symptoms in diagnosing infection. Furthermore, the symptoms assessed in this review were not in the context of fever. The SIGN guideline decision aid was developed by the Scottish Antimicrobial Prescribing Group. Of note, they cite five references that were used to formulate the guidance: two from the Health Protection Agency, SIGN guideline 88, one qualitative case study, and one cluster randomised clinical trial.

Interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) initial evaluation — history, examination, and labs should be documented as follows: The number of voids per day, urge to void, and pain characteristics "should be documented", and dyspareunia, dysuria, ejaculatory pain, and menstrual relation "should also be noted". The physical examination "should include an abdominal and pelvic examination", pelvic floor muscles "should be palpated", and pelvic support "should be documented", with a focused evaluation to rule out alternative sources of pain or infection. A brief neurologic exam and assessment for incomplete bladder emptying "should be done on all patients". Basic laboratory evaluation "includes a urinalysis and urine culture", a hematuria workup "should be performed" for unevaluated hematuria and "considered" with tobacco exposure, and urine culture "may be indicated even in patients with a negative urinalysis".

### Dysuria at onset of interstitial cystitis / painful bladder syndrome in women [^114Lu8XG]. Urology (2006). Low credibility.

Objectives

In an ongoing national study of women to identify risk factors for interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome (IC/PBS), dysuria was identified at the onset of IC/PBS in a small majority and the evidence for urinary tract infection was evaluated.

Methods

In women with IC/PBS of 12 months' duration or less, symptoms and pertinent laboratory tests at onset were assessed by telephone interview and medical record review.

Results

Of 138 women, 75 (54%) reported that they had started to experience burning or pain on urination at the onset of IC/PBS. Of those with urine cultures, 12 (34%) of 35 women with dysuria versus 1 (5%) of 21 without dysuria yielded a uropathogen (P = 0.01). Similarly, the microscopic white blood cell count and dipstick nitrites and leukocyte esterase were each significantly more common in the urine samples of those with dysuria than in those without. Additionally, 7 of 75 of those with dysuria versus 1 of 62 without dysuria reported chills or fever at the onset of IC/PBS. Using various definitions, the prevalence of urinary tract infection at the onset of IC/PBS, at a minimum, was 16% to 33% of those with dysuria versus less than 2% of those without dysuria (P ≤ 0.003).

Conclusions

A slight majority of women with IC/PBS reported dysuria at onset of their IC/PBS symptoms. The available laboratory data have suggested that dysuria may be a sensitive indicator of urinary tract infection at the onset of IC/PBS; however, its specificity is as yet undetermined.

### Diagnostic value of symptoms and signs for identifying urinary tract infection in older adult outpatients: systematic review and meta-analysis [^113r1RCg]. The Journal of Infection (2018). Low credibility.

Summary ROC plots

Both urinary incontinence and dysuria were predictors of UTI [+ ve LR: 1.96 (95% CI 1.48–2.60) and + ve LR: 1.70 (95% CI 1.12–2.57), respectively]. Absence of these symptoms did not help to rule out a diagnosis of UTI (Fig. 6). Fig. 6 shows that urinary incontinence and dysuria were quite specific, but not sensitive for UTI.

Summary ROC plots for both urinary frequency and nocturia revealed high heterogeneity and so we did not calculate pooled estimates for these symptoms (See supplementary file 2).

Dumbbell plots

Urinary tract specific symptoms

Estimates for UTI specific symptoms were divided into seven broad categories, with gender specific estimates given when possible (Fig. 3). Much variation was found in the way that symptoms were described by studies. For example, incontinence was defined in six different ways, dysuria in five different ways, and urinary frequency was described in six different ways (Fig. 3).

Fig. 3 shows that when both sexes were assessed together, incontinence and a change in the character of urine were found to be predictors of UTI. One of the three estimates for dysuria produced a significant result. In women, of the four estimates for urinary incontinence, only one predicted UTI. This was also true of urinary frequency, where one of four estimates produced a significant result. Of the six estimates for nocturia in women, only one was significant in predicting UTI. None of the eight estimates for dysuria and urgency in women were significant, and absence of these symptoms did not help rule out UTI. Cloudy urine was a significant predictor of UTI in women, but not foul smelling urine or haematuria.

In men, there was only a single estimate for both urinary incontinence and frequency, but both produced significant results. Nocturia was not a predictor of UTI. However, unlike in women, dysuria was helpful in diagnosing UTI. Cloudy urine, foul smelling urine and haematuria were all predictors of UTI in men. Of note, all of the estimates in men came from a single studythat was assessed as low risk against six of the seven QUADAS-2 domains (Fig. 2 b).

### Urinalysis: a comprehensive review [^117XeZs7]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

A complete urinalysis includes physical, chemical, and microscopic examinations. Midstream clean collection is acceptable in most situations, but the specimen should be examined within two hours of collection. Cloudy urine often is a result of precipitated phosphate crystals in alkaline urine, but pyuria also can be the cause. A strong odor may be the result of a concentrated specimen rather than a urinary tract infection. Dipstick urinalysis is convenient, but false-positive and false-negative results can occur. Specific gravity provides a reliable assessment of the patient's hydration status. Microhematuria has a range of causes, from benign to life threatening. Glomerular, renal, and urologic causes of microhematuria often can be differentiated by other elements of the urinalysis. Although transient proteinuria typically is a benign condition, persistent proteinuria requires further work-up. Uncomplicated urinary tract infections diagnosed by positive leukocyte esterase and nitrite tests can be treated without culture.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^11619zp2]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Education and informed decision-making — supportive care and risk of progression note that the prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria is enhanced by the unnecessary antibiotic treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria and that the diagnosis of UTI is highly imprecise. While no evidence exists to support the concept of withholding antimicrobials to patients with rUTIs, substantial effort should be made to avoid unnecessary treatment unless there is a high suspicion of UTI. For patients with episodes of acute cystitis without complicating factors, there is minimal risk of progression to tissue invasion or pyelonephritis, and additional characteristics of great concern do not reliably indicate risk or presence of bacteremic bacteriuria or pyelonephritis. In a representative study of older patients with bacteremia who had the same bacterial species cultured from the urine, only 1 of 37 participants aged 75 years and older had symptoms consistent with UTI, such as dysuria. Multiple randomized placebo-controlled trials have demonstrated that antibiotic treatment for acute cystitis offers little but mildly faster symptomatic improvement compared to placebo in patients with acute dysuria and significant bacteriuria, and the incidence of pyelonephritis in these patients is low and is not substantially different in individuals receiving antibiotics versus those treated with supportive care of analgesics and hydration; expectant management with analgesics and hydration while awaiting culture results is likely underutilized.

Diagnosis — women with frequent UTI may experience diagnostic delay if clinicians do not review the UTI history; clinicians should order pretreatment urine cultures to document rUTI (culture-proven UTI ≥ 2 in 6 months or ≥ 3 in 12 months), and although infrequent UTI can be assessed with less rigor and treated empirically, women with frequent UTI who are being formally assessed for rUTI should have detailed symptom assessment and pretreatment urine culture and sensitivity.

### Diagnosis and treatment of urinary tract infections across age groups [^1135JKJ5]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections are the most common outpatient infections, but predicting the probability of urinary tract infections through symptoms and test results can be complex. The most diagnostic symptoms of urinary tract infections include change in frequency, dysuria, urgency, and presence or absence of vaginal discharge, but urinary tract infections may present differently in older women. Dipstick urinalysis is popular for its availability and usefulness, but results must be interpreted in context of the patient's pretest probability based on symptoms and characteristics. In patients with a high probability of urinary tract infection based on symptoms, negative dipstick urinalysis does not rule out urinary tract infection. Nitrites are likely more sensitive and specific than other dipstick components for urinary tract infection, particularly in the elderly. Positive dipstick testing is likely specific for asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnancy, but urine culture is still the test of choice. Microscopic urinalysis is likely comparable to dipstick urinalysis as a screening test. Bacteriuria is more specific and sensitive than pyuria for detecting urinary tract infection, even in older women and during pregnancy. Pyuria is commonly found in the absence of infection, particularly in older adults with lower urinary tract symptoms such as incontinence. Positive testing may increase the probability of urinary tract infection, but initiation of treatment should take into account risk of urinary tract infection based on symptoms as well. In cases in which the probability of urinary tract infection is moderate or unclear, urine culture should be performed. Urine culture is the gold standard for detection of urinary tract infection. However, asymptomatic bacteriuria is common, particularly in older women, and should not be treated with antibiotics. Conversely, in symptomatic women, even growth as low as 10 2 colony-forming unit/mL could reflect infection. Resistance is increasing to fluoroquinolones, beta-lactams, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Most uropathogens still display good sensitivity to nitrofurantoin. First-line treatments for urinary tract infection include nitrofurantoin, fosfomycin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (when resistance levels are < 20%). These antibiotics have minimal collateral damage and resistance. In pregnancy, beta-lactams, nitrofurantoin, fosfomycin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole can be appropriate treatments. Interpreting the probability of urinary tract infection based on symptoms and testing allows for greater accuracy in diagnosis of urinary tract infection, decreasing overtreatment and encouraging antimicrobial stewardship.

Recurrent urinary tract infection — laboratory reporting limits and interpretation: Many laboratories will not report colony counts < 10³ CFU/mL, and strict use of a low threshold is likely to lead to overdiagnosis; therefore, determining whether a standard urine culture represents clinically significant bacteriuria must factor the clinical presentation, urine collection method, and suggestive findings such as pyuria and urinary nitrites.

### A cost-minimization analysis of treatment options for postmenopausal women with dysuria [^116xJLDk]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Empiric therapy for urinary tract infection is difficult in postmenopausal women because of the higher rates of confounding lower urinary tract symptoms and differential resistance profiles of uropathogens in this population.

Objective

The objective of the study was to determine the least costly strategy for treatment of postmenopausal women with the primary complaint of dysuria.

Study Design

We performed a cost minimization analysis modeling the following clinical options: (1) empiric antibiotic therapy followed by urine culture, (2) urinalysis with empiric antibiotic therapy only if positive nitrites and leukocyte esterase, or (3) waiting for culture prior to initiating antibiotics. For all strategies we included nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, fosfomycin, ciprofloxacin, or cephalexin. Pathogens included Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Klebsiella pneumonaie, or Proteus mirabalis. Pathogens, resistance, treatment success, and medication side effects were specific to postmenopausal women.

Results

Cost minimization modeling with TreeAge Pro assumed 73.4% of urinary tract infections were caused by Escherichia coli with 24.4% resistance to nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. With our assumptions, empiric antibiotics with nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole was the least costly approach ($89.64/patient), followed by waiting for urine culture ($97.04/patient). Except for empiric antibiotics with fosfomcyin, empiric antibiotics was always less costly than using urinalysis to discriminate antibiotic use. This is due to the cost of urinalysis ($38.23), high rate of both urinary tract infection (91%), and positive urinalysis (69.3%) with dysuria in postmenopausal women and resultant high rate of antibiotic use with or without urinalysis. Options with fosfomycin were the most expensive because of the highest drug costs ($98/dose), and tornado analyses showed fosfomycin cost was the most impactful variable for model outcomes. Sensitivity analyses showed empiric fosfomycin became the least costly option if drug costs were $25.80, a price still more costly than almost all modeled baseline drug costs. This outcome was largely predicated on low resistance to fosfomycin. Conversely, ciprofloxacin was never the least costly option because of higher resistance and side effect cost, even if the drug cost was $0. We modeled 91% positive urine culture rate in postmenopausal women with dysuria; waiting for the urine culture prior to treatment would be the least costly strategy in a population with a predicted positive culture rate of < 65%.

Conclusion

The least costly strategy was empiric antibiotics with nitrofurantoin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, followed by waiting on culture results. Local resistance patterns will have an impact on cost minimization strategies. Empiric fosfomycin would be least costly with reduced drug costs, even at a level at which drug costs were higher than almost all other antibiotics. In a population with high posttest probability of positive urine culture, urinalysis adds unnecessary cost. Antibiotic stewardship programs should continue efforts to decrease fluoroquinolone use because of high resistance, side effects, and increased cost.

Comparison with existing guidelines

SIGN guidelines for UTI in older adults advise against the use of the urine dipstick as a diagnostic test due to lack of high quality evidence. This advice is echoed by Public Health England guidance, because positive urine dipsticks are often be caused by asymptomatic bacteriuria. The results of our review contradict these recommendations, and suggest that a positive urine dipstick for nitrites and leucocytes is helpful in diagnosing UTI in symptomatic older adults. Further studies in this area are required to corroborate or refute these findings.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^114UNutx]. The Journal of Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on acute cystitis:

- **Definition**: Acute bacterial cystitis is defined as an infection of the urinary tract with acute-onset symptoms, such as dysuria in conjunction with variable degrees of increased urinary urgency and frequency, hematuria, and new or worsening incontinence, evidence of urinary tract inflammation (pyuria ≥ 5 WBC/high power field on microscopic urinalysis, and the presence of bacterial uropathogen. Localized urinary traction infection (previously uncomplicated urinary traction infection) is an infection of the urinary tract in a healthy patient with an anatomically and functionally normal urinary tract, no signs or symptoms of upper urinary involvement or bacteremia, and no known complicating factors that would make the patient susceptible to progression to a systemic infection. Systemic UTI is an infection of the urinary tract with signs and symptoms of systemic infection, with or without localized symptoms originating from any site in the urinary tract. Recurrent UTI is defined as two separate episodes of acute bacterial cystitis and associated symptoms over a 6-month period within the preceding year. Asymptomatic bacteriuria is defined as the presence of bacteria in the urine that causes no illness or symptoms.
- **Pathophysiology**: Acute uncomplicated cystitis is mostly caused by bacteria, including E. coli (86%), S. saprophyticus (4%), Klebsiella species (3%), Proteus species (3%), Enterobacter species (1.4%), Citrobacter species (0.8%), and Enterococcus species (0.5%).
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for acute uncomplicated cystitis include female gender, recent sexual activity, use of a diaphragm with spermicide, and a history of recurrent UTIs. Complicating factors for UTIs include patient factors that place an individual at higher risk for development of a UTI and potentially decrease efficacy of therapy. Such factors include anatomic or functional abnormality of the urinary tract (stone disease, diverticulum, neurogenic bladder), immunocompromised host, and indwelling urinary tract foreign body (indwelling urethral catheters, ureteral stents).
- **Disease course**: Bacterial infection of the lower urinary tract results in acute uncomplicated cystitis, which causes classic symptoms of dysuria, frequent voiding of small volumes, and urinary urgency. Occasional hematuria and suprapubic discomfort may be present.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Acute uncomplicated cystitis is not associated with an increase in mortality.

### Dysuria: evaluation and differential diagnosis in adults [^111Gwqad]. American Family Physician (2025). Medium credibility.

Dysuria, a feeling of pain or discomfort during urination, is often caused by urinary tract infection but can also be due to sexually transmitted infection, bladder irritants, skin lesions, and some chronic pain conditions. History is most often useful for finding signs of sexually transmitted infection, complicated infections, lower urinary symptoms in males, and noninfectious causes. Most patients presenting with dysuria should have a urinalysis performed. Urine culture should be performed for infection to guide appropriate antibiotic use, especially for recurrent or suspected complicated urinary tract infection. Vaginal discharge decreases the likelihood of urinary tract infection, and other causes of dysuria, including cervicitis, should be investigated. If a patient has persistent urethritis or cervicitis with negative initial testing, Mycoplasma genitalium testing is recommended. Clinical decision rules may increase the accuracy of diagnosis with and without laboratory analysis. Evaluation and treatment of dysuria through a virtual encounter without laboratory testing may increase recurrent symptoms and antibiotic courses. Persistent symptoms after initial evaluation and treatment require further workup for infectious and noninfectious causes.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^112tRjeX]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Recurrent urinary tract infection — diagnostic criteria and documentation (Clinical Principle) states that clinicians should document evidence of inflammation (pyuria) and uropathogenic bacteria during symptomatic episodes, defining recurrent urinary tract infection (rUTI) as at least two acute episodes in six months of urinary tract–associated symptoms and signs. Evidence of infection should include significant bacteriuria and urinary inflammation (pyuria with ≥ 5 WBC/hpf on microscopic urinalysis), and the absence of pyuria rules out UTI in symptomatic women with confirmed bacteriuria. Documentation of bacterial uropathogens during each symptomatic period is critical, and inconsistent bacteriuria or organisms should prompt consideration of alternative diagnoses; given limitations of standard urine culture, clinicians should consider additional available information, including alternative tests, with critical deliberation, and it is important to consider all clinical and laboratory data when deciding whether antibiotic treatment is needed.

### Utility of catheterized specimens in reducing overdiagnosis of urinary tract infections in women [^113gwMzq]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2018). Low credibility.

Aims

To evaluate the utility of catheterized samples in reducing overdiagnosis of UTI based on voided specimens among patients presenting with a range of urinary symptoms. We also aimed to determine variables that may modify the predictive value of the voided midstream urine culture.

Methods

Patient charts were reviewed to identify female patients referred to our voiding dysfunction clinic with a range of complaints warranting urine studies (5/2014–8/2016). Patients with a positive voided urine culture who also had a catheterized urine culture in our system were included. Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to identify patient characteristics associated with a negative catheterized specimen despite a positive voided specimen.

Results

One hundred and seven women were included in the study. Eighty percent of the cohort was post-menopausal. Although all patients had positive voided specimens, only 53 (49.5%) had positive catheterized specimens. On multivariate analysis negative nitrites on clean catch UA was a significant predictor of a negative catheterized sample (adjusted OR 8.9, 95%CI 2.2–43.7, P = 0.003). WBC/HPF < 10 on clean catch UA trended towards significance (adjusted OR 4.72, 95%CI 1.1–26.1, P = 0.05).

Conclusions

Relying on clean catch urine samples may lead to significant over-diagnosis of UTIs. Our study suggests that in female patients who have vague symptoms of UTI, obtaining catheterized specimens may be beneficial in avoiding the overdiagnosis of UTIs and the overuse of antibiotics. Larger, prospective studies testing our hypothesis are necessary, and would greatly assist in establishing clinical practices that reduce the amount of antibiotics inappropriately prescribed.

### Rapid tests and urine sampling techniques for the diagnosis of urinary tract infection (UTI) in children under five years: a systematic review [^114nZCuF]. BMC Pediatrics (2005). Low credibility.

What do these results mean?

If we take an estimate for the prevalence of UTI in children presenting to their GP with symptoms of possible UTI (the pre-test probability of disease), i.e. children in whom tests to diagnose UTI are likely to be used, likelihood ratios can be used to calculate the post-test probability of UTI. We were unable to find reliable estimates of the pre-test probability of UTI in the literature, and therefore used the results from the included studies to provide an estimate. Only studies that included an appropriate patient spectrum were included in this analysis. UTI prevalence varied greatly between studies (3–73%). As the distribution was highly skewed we used the median prevalence, which was 20%. Figure 5 shows how the probability of UTI changes after testing. In a typical primary care setting in which the pre-test probability of disease is estimated to be around 20%, a negative likelihood ratio of 0.20 translates to a post-test probability of UTI of about 4%. In other words, children who receive a dipstick test negative for both nitrite and LE have a 4% probability of having a UTI.

### Diagnostic accuracy of dipsticks for urinary tract infections in acutely hospitalised patients: a prospective population-based observational cohort study [^111YuF3P]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Study population 1: all patients examined with both dipstick and urine culture (n = 607)

Using the mCDC definition as reference, the sensitivity and specificity of a positive dipstick were 87% (95% CI 78% to 93%) and 45% (95% CI 41% to 50%), respectively, for dipsticks positive for either LE, nitrite or both (online supplemental tables 4 and 5). The corresponding PPV and NPV were 21% (95% CI 17% to 26%) and 95% (95% CI 92% to 98%), whereas the positive and negative LRs were 1.58 (95% CI 1.41 to 1.77) and 0.30 (95% CI 0.18 to 0.51). In comparison, sensitivities and specificities were 34% (95% CI 24% to 45%) and 86% (95% CI 83% to 89%) in analyses restricted to those positive for both LE and nitrite yielding a PPV of 29% (95% CI 21% to 39%) and an NPV of 88% (95% CI 85% to 91%). The corresponding positive and negative LRs were 2.38 (95% CI 1.66 to 3.41) and 0.77 (95% CI 0.66 to 0.90), respectively.

Using the mCDC definition as reference, the pretest probabilities of UTI in patients with specific symptoms of UTI ranged from 29% (95% CI 18% to 41%) in those with costovertebral tenderness to 60% (95% CI 48% to 71%) in patients with dysuria (table 2). The corresponding post-test probabilities increased to 35% (95% CI 21% to 50%) and 68% (95% CI 55% to 80%), respectively, in those with a dipstick positive for LE, nitrite or both, and decreased to 12% (95% CI 1% to 36%) and 27% (95% CI 8% to 55%) in those with a negative dipstick.

### The use of urinary dipstick tests to exclude urinary tract infection: a systematic review of the literature [^1161SvQk]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2006). Low credibility.

Several systematic reviews have examined the use of dipstick tests to diagnose or rule in urinary tract infection (UTI). We examined the evidence relating to the use of urine leukocyte esterase and nitrite tests in adults to exclude or rule out UTI. A search of the literature from 1966 to 2003 revealed 30 studies as containing relevant and suitable information and 23 of these, which used a cut-off of 108 colony-forming units per liter, were combined in a meta-analysis. The leukocyte esterase or nitrite test combination, with one or the other test positive, was used in 14 studies, showed the highest sensitivity and the lowest negative likelihood ratio. While there was significant heterogeneity between the studies, 7 of 14 demonstrated significant decreases in pretest to posttest probability with a pooled posttest probability of 5% for the negative result. In certain circumstances, there is evidence for the use of urinalysis as a rule-out test for UTI.

### Observation of intracellular bacterial communities in urinary sediment using brightfield microscopy; a case report [^117MeXmr]. BMC Urology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are usually related to the presence of Escherichia coli, a microorganism that adopts an intracellular life-style during the pathogenesis of cystitis. Evidence of the underlying mechanism in urothelial cells from urine samples has been reported. However, intracellular communities have not yet been described in squamous cells in fresh samples stained with Sternheimer-Malbin method, thus, we have provided these descriptions in this case report.

Case Presentation

Number 1 was a male patient with symptoms of UTI, his urinalysis revealed hematuria and nitrites. In the urine sediment, we found urothelial cells with internal endosomes filled with short rods. Case number 2, female patient with recurrent UTI by E. coli, her urinalysis showed positive nitrites, glycosuria, bacteriuria and squamous cells with endosomes filled with short rods. Both patients were positive for E. coli isolation.

Conclusions

These case reports provide evidence of the presence of intracellular bacterial communities in urothelial and squamous cells (not previously reported) in fresh urine samples stained with Sternheimer-Malbin using brightfield microscopy. The clinical impact and pathogenic mechanisms involved in the invasion of the squamous epithelium need further investigation.

### Dysuria: evaluation and differential diagnosis in adults [^115RQPT9]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

The most common cause of acute dysuria is infection, especially cystitis. Other infectious causes include urethritis, sexually transmitted infections, and vaginitis. Noninfectious inflammatory causes include a foreign body in the urinary tract and dermatologic conditions. Noninflammatory causes of dysuria include medication use, urethral anatomic abnormalities, local trauma, and interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome. An initial targeted history includes features of a local cause (e.g., vaginal or urethral irritation), risk factors for a complicated urinary tract infection (e.g., male sex, pregnancy, presence of urologic obstruction, recent procedure), and symptoms of pyelonephritis. Women with dysuria who have no complicating features can be treated for cystitis without further diagnostic evaluation. Women with vulvovaginal symptoms should be evaluated for vaginitis. Any complicating features or recurrent symptoms warrant a history, physical examination, urinalysis, and urine culture. Findings from the secondary evaluation, selected laboratory tests, and directed imaging studies enable physicians to progress through a logical evaluation and determine the cause of dysuria or make an appropriate referral.

### A 26-year-old woman with dysuria and hematuria [^113uL9Eq]. Urology (2021). Medium credibility.

In this case, we present imaging findings characteristic of chronic genitourinary schistosomiasis. Schistosoma haematobium, a blood fluke endemic to Africa and the Middle East, is a prominent cause of hematuria and bladder cancer in regions lacking adequate water sanitation. Luminal calcifications of the genitourinary tract, that is, of the bladder and/or ureters, from deposition of fluke eggs are a classic sign of chronic S. haematobium infection and should raise suspicion for the disease even when urine or serological tests are negative. It is important to recognize these findings on CT or, in resource-limited settings, plain film to allow for prompt, effective treatment.

### Effectiveness of five different approaches in management of urinary tract infection: randomised controlled trial [^114eitib]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Objective To assess the impact of different management strategies in urinary tract infections.

Design Randomised controlled trial.

Setting Primary care.

Participants 309 non-pregnant women aged 18–70 presenting with suspected urinary tract infection.

Intervention Patients were randomised to five management approaches: empirical antibiotics; empirical delayed (by 48 hours) antibiotics; or targeted antibiotics based on a symptom score (two or more of urine cloudiness, urine smell, nocturia, or dysuria), a dipstick result (nitrite or both leucocytes and blood), or a positive result on midstream urine analysis. Self help advice was controlled in each group.

Main outcome measures Symptom severity (days 2 to 4) and duration, and use of antibiotics.

Results Patients had 3.5 days of moderately bad symptoms if they took antibiotics immediately. There were no significant differences in duration or severity of symptoms (mean frequency of symptoms on a 0 to 6 scale: immediate antibiotics 2.15, midstream urine 2.08, dipstick 1.74, symptom score 1.77, delayed antibiotics 2.11; likelihood ratio test for the five groups P = 0.177). There were differences in antibiotic use (immediate antibiotics 97%, midstream urine 81%, dipstick 80%, symptom score 90%, delayed antibiotics 77%; P = 0.011) and in sending midstream urine samples (immediate antibiotics 23%, midstream urine 89%, dipstick 36%, symptom score 33%, delayed antibiotics 15%; P < 0.001). Patients who waited at least 48 hours to start taking antibiotics reconsulted less (hazard ratio 0.57 (95% confidence interval 0.36 to 0.89), P = 0.014) but on average had symptoms for 37% longer than those taking immediate antibiotics (incident rate ratio 1.37 (1.11 to 1.68), P = 0.003), particularly the midstream urine group (73% longer, 22% to 140%; none of the other groups had more than 22% longer duration).

Conclusion All management strategies achieve similar symptom control. There is no advantage in routinely sending midstream urine samples for testing, and antibiotics targeted with dipstick tests with a delayed prescription as backup, or empirical delayed prescription, can help to reduce antibiotic use.

### Diagnosis and treatment of acute uncomplicated cystitis [^116D2UjH]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections are the most common bacterial infections in women. Most urinary tract infections are acute uncomplicated cystitis. Identifiers of acute uncomplicated cystitis are frequency and dysuria in an immunocompetent woman of childbearing age who has no comorbidities or urologic abnormalities. Physical examination is typically normal or positive for suprapubic tenderness. A urinalysis, but not urine culture, is recommended in making the diagnosis. Guidelines recommend three options for first-line treatment of acute uncomplicated cystitis: fosfomycin, nitrofurantoin, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (in regions where the prevalence of Escherichia coli resistance does not exceed 20 percent). Beta-lactam antibiotics, amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefaclor, cefdinir, and cefpodoxime are not recommended for initial treatment because of concerns about resistance. Urine cultures are recommended in women with suspected pyelonephritis, women with symptoms that do not resolve or that recur within two to four weeks after completing treatment, and women who present with atypical symptoms.

### History and physical examination plus laboratory testing for the diagnosis of adult female urinary tract infection [^1173wmU7]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Emergency physicians often encounter females presenting with symptoms suggestive of urinary tract infections (UTIs). The diagnostic accuracy of history, physical examination, and bedside laboratory tests for female UTIs in emergency departments (EDs) have not been quantitatively described.

Objectives

This was a systematic review to determine the utility of history and physical examination (H&P) and urinalysis in diagnosing uncomplicated female UTI in the ED.

Methods

The medical literature was searched from January 1965 through October 2012 in PUBMED and EMBASE using the following criteria: Patients were females greater than 18 years of age in the ED suspected of having UTIs. Interventions were H&P and urinalysis used to diagnose a UTI. The comparator was UTI confirmed by a positive urine culture. The outcome was operating characteristics of the interventions in diagnosing a UTI. Study quality was assessed using Quality Assessment Tool for Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2). Sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios (LRs) were calculated using Meta-DiSc.

Results

Four studies (pooled n = 948) were included with UTI prevalence ranging from 40% to 60%. H&P variables all had positive LRs (+LR, range = 0.8 to 2.2) and negative LRs (-LR, range = 0.7 to 1.0) that are insufficient to significantly alter pretest probability of UTI. Only a positive nitrite reaction (+LR = 7.5 to 24.5) was useful to rule in a UTI. To rule out UTI, only a negative leukocyte esterase (LE; -LR = 0.2) or blood reaction on urine dipstick (-LR = 0.2) were significantly accurate. Increasing pyuria directly correlated with +LR, and moderate pyuria (urine white blood cells [uWBC] > 50 colony-forming units [CFUs]/ml) and moderate bacteruria were good predictors of UTI (+LR = 6.4 and 15.0, respectively).

Conclusions

No single H&P finding can accurately rule in or rule out UTI in symptomatic women. Urinalysis with a positive nitrite or moderate pyuria and/or bacteruria are accurate predictors of a UTI. If the pretest probability of UTI is sufficiently low, a negative urinalysis can accurately rule out the diagnosis.

### Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI): clinical guidelines for treatment and management [^11285M1j]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI) classifications — intended to guide treatment, not diagnosis — describe a clinical syndrome characterized by local bladder signs and symptoms such as dysuria, urgency, frequency, and suprapubic pain, and are defined by absence of findings suggesting infection beyond the bladder: no fever unless explained by a non-UTI cause, no other signs or symptoms of systemic illness (including chills, rigors, or unstable vital signs) unless explained by a non-UTI cause, no flank pain, and no costovertebral angle tenderness. Uncomplicated UTI can occur in females or males, patients with underlying urologic abnormalities, patients with immunocompromise, and persons with diabetes; recurrent UTI can be uncomplicated. Patients with urinary catheters (including transurethral, suprapubic, and intermittent catheterization), stents, and percutaneous nephrostomy tubes generally do not have uncomplicated UTI, and these guidelines are not intended to apply to bacterial prostatitis, epididymitis, or orchitis.

Any identified UTI should be treated, and the patient should be instructed to follow up for assessment if symptoms do not resolve. If microscopic hematuria (> 3 RBC/HPF) is identified in the absence of infection, further evaluation should be performed in accordance with the Microhematuria: AUA/SUFU Guideline, and the presence of glucosuria or proteinuria may be the sequelae of diabetes.

### A revalidation and critique of assumptions about urinary sample collection methods, specimen quality and contamination [^113vD2ya]. International Urogynecology Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

A urinary tract infection (UTI) is the leading reason why patients seek treatment in primary care. One in three women will be treated with antibiotics for UTI by the age of 24 and 40% to 50% of women will experience one or more UTIs in their lifetime, with 10–15% experiencing recurrent infections. A UTI is commonly identified among young adolescents attending sexual health centres and accounts for 17% of treatment cases. In the adult population of 65 years and older, a UTI is the second most common cause of infectious disease related to hospitalisations in the USA. A UTI is a debilitating condition causing the onset of painful urination (dysuria), increased urinary frequency, the inability to start urinating (hesitancy) and the sensation of a sudden need to urinate (urgency), all of which are classified as lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS).

Many clinical guidelines advocate urinary dipstick testing for leucocyte esterase and nitrite as a means of detecting UTI, but evidence suggests that their utility might be limited. Dipstick analyses are surrogate tests, referenced not to microscopic pyuria but to a gold standard urine culture threshold for UTI, which guidelines accept as being between 10³ cfu mL⁻¹ and 10⁶ cfu mL⁻¹ of the pure growth of a single urinary pathogen. This test has attracted criticism too. Furthermore, the literature shows that the methods of sample collection for urine culture have never been validated in appropriate clinical trials. Justification for the use of such methods is based on plausible assumptions without supporting evidence. It is now recognised that routine urinalyses, including dipstick and culture, are insensitive, thus missing genuine infection in many symptomatic patients.

Urine dipstick tests (nitrite and leukocyte esterase) — Dipstick assays detect leukocyte esterase (LE) and urinary nitrite, and bacterial conversion of dietary nitrates to nitrites requires approximately 4 hours in the bladder; because infants void frequently, a nitrite test is not sensitive and negative results have little value in ruling out urinary tract infection (UTI), although a positive nitrite is highly specific. In clinically suspected UTI, LE sensitivity is 94%, with overall reported sensitivity 83% and specificity average 72% (range: 64%–92%); positive LE results should be interpreted with caution because false-positive results are common and pyuria is nonspecific.

### Comparison of test characteristics of urine dipstick and urinalysis at various test cutoff points [^1173eXVD]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Study Objective

We compare the test characteristics of urine dipstick and urinalysis at various test cutoff points in women presenting to emergency departments and an intermediate care center with symptoms of urinary tract infection.

Methods

This was a prospective, observational study of adult women presenting to 1 of 2 community hospital EDs or an intermediate care center with dysuria, urgency, or urinary frequency on history, or suprapubic or costovertebral angle tenderness on examination. Patients who had taken antibiotics in the past 72 hours, had indwelling Foley catheters, symptomatic vaginal discharge, diabetes mellitus, immunodeficiency disorders, or were unable to provide a reliable history were excluded. The patient's clean-catch or catheterized urine specimen was tested immediately by a nurse using a Multistix 9 SG reagent strip. A second aliquot was sent within 1 hour of collection to the hospital laboratory, where a semiautomated microscopic urinalysis and a urine culture were performed. A positive urine culture was defined as more than 100,000 colonies of 1 or 2 uropathogenic bacteria per mL of urine at 48 hours. Dipstick and urinalysis data were compared with urine culture results. Sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values were calculated at various definitions of a positive test, or "test cutoff points", for combinations of leukocyte esterase, nitrite, and blood on dipstick and for RBCs and WBCs on urinalyses. The probability of an erroneous decision to withhold treatment on the basis of a negative test result was defined as "undertreatment", or 1 minus the negative predictive value. "Overtreatment" was defined as 1 minus the positive predictive value.

Results

Three hundred forty-three patients were enrolled in this study. Twelve patients were withdrawn because of missing laboratory results. Forty-six percent (152/331) of patients had positive urine cultures. If urine dipstick results are defined as positive when leukocyte esterase or nitrite is positive or blood is more than trace, the overtreatment rate is 47% (156/331) and the undertreatment rate is 13% (43/331). If urinalysis results are defined as positive when WBCs are more than 3 per high-power field or RBCs are more than 5 per high-power field, the overtreatment rate is 44% (146/331) and the undertreatment rate is 11% (36/331). Matched pairs of test characteristics were identified when the analysis was repeated using more than 10,000 colonies per mL as a positive culture.

Conclusion

In this patient population, similar overtreatment and undertreatment rates were identified for various test cutoff points for urine dipstick tests and urinalysis. Although a urine dipstick may be equivalent to a urinalysis for the diagnosis of urinary tract infection, the limitations in the diagnostic accuracy of both tests should be incorporated into medical decisionmaking.

INTRODUCTION

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are some of the most common bacterial infections, with estimates of up to 150 million cases a year worldwide. In the United States alone, UTI symptoms account for almost 1% of all clinic visits, and the societal costs associated with these infections are calculated to cost the United States approximately $3.5 billion a year based on health care costs and lost productivity. The high occurrence of UTIs and the ease of specimen collection create a large burden on clinical laboratories, accounting for 24 to 80% of all cultures set up, depending upon the laboratory's serviced population.

Laboratory diagnosis of UTIs is based on urinalysis, including several markers such as nitrite, leukocyte esterase, and microscopic urinalysis white blood cell count; however, bacterial culture is necessary for definitive diagnosis of symptomatic and asymptomatic UTIs. Interpretation of bacterial culture is dependent upon the bacterial burden, diversity, and clinical scenario, including assignment of uncomplicated versus complicated infection. Complicated UTIs are typically defined as a patient with a structural or functional urinary tract abnormality or altered immune system, whereas uncomplicated UTIs are characterized as females of childbearing age with symptoms of dysuria or urgency but lacking systemic symptoms. For uncomplicated UTIs, current Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines define a bacterial burden of ≥ 10⁴ CFU/ml as significant. This threshold is reduced to 10³ CFU/ml when specimens are tested from patients with complicated UTIs due to their increased risk and likelihood of disseminated or severe infection.

### Urine flow cytometry in older adults urinary tract infection diagnosis: is it time to reevaluate thresholds for men and women? [^111cNbN7]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is common and is classically described as urinary symptoms associated with a positive urine culture. Symptoms of UTI can vary widely but often include dysuria, increased frequency, urgency of urination, and lower abdominal pain. However the diagnosis of UTI in older adults is challenging due to atypical or subtle symptoms and frequent cognitive impairment. In addition, urine cultures are often positive due to the high rate of asymptomatic bacteriuria, further complicating the diagnosis. Urine dipsticks, commonly used as a preliminary diagnostic tool, provide a rapid and non-invasive method of testing for UTIs by detecting the presence of leukocytes and nitrites in the urine. While urine dipsticks give good results in young patients, they may not be able to accurately identify UTIs in older patients. This inadequacy is probably due to the high prevalence of asymptomatic bacteriuria combined with the fact that the leukocyturia thresholds used to guide the diagnosis of UTIs are based on younger populations and may not be appropriate for older people. Automated urine flow cytometers provide rapid and accurate counts of white blood cells, red blood cells, bacteria and epithelial cells in urine samples. As urine culture is time-consuming and does not aid the diagnosis of UTI in the emergency setting, several studies have established specific thresholds or scoring systems using these automated results to detect UTI or positive urine cultures. However, these studies have primarily focused on younger adults, limiting their relevance to older patients.

Given these challenges, there is an urgent need to develop diagnostic criteria applicable to the older adults. This study proposes to investigate older patients admitted to the hospital with a urine culture obtained in the emergency department. The primary objective was to evaluate the flow cytometry parameters for the diagnosis of UTI in older patients and compare them with the performance of the urine dipstick. We also aimed to evaluate the association of biological parameters and clinical symptoms to exclude or diagnose UTI before urine culture results.

### Evaluation of dysuria in adults [^116shPap]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Dysuria, defined as pain, burning, or discomfort on urination, is more common in women than in men. Although urinary tract infection is the most frequent cause of dysuria, empiric treatment with antibiotics is not always appropriate. Dysuria occurs more often in younger women, probably because of their greater frequency of sexual activity. Older men are more likely to have dysuria because of an increased incidence of prostatic hyperplasia with accompanying inflammation and infection. A comprehensive history and physical examination can often reveal the cause of dysuria. Urinalysis may not be needed in healthier patients who have uncomplicated medical histories and symptoms. In most patients, however, urinalysis can help to determine the presence of infection and confirm a suspected diagnosis. Urine cultures and both urethral and vaginal smears and cultures can help to identify sites of infection and causative agents. Coliform organisms, notably Escherichia coli, are the most common pathogens in urinary tract infection. Dysuria can also be caused by noninfectious inflammation or trauma, neoplasm, calculi, hypoestrogenism, interstitial cystitis, or psychogenic disorders. Although radiography and other forms of imaging are rarely needed, these studies may identify abnormalities in the upper urinary tract when symptoms are more complex.

3.1 Section 1: Assessment of Urinary Symptoms

Table 1 and Appendix S5 present the evidence supporting the recommendations for assessing urinary symptoms. Figure 2 illustrates the assessment and treatment algorithm for urinary symptoms based on these recommendations.

Clinical Question 1. Should neurologists obtain a history of a patient's urinary symptoms versus not asking about urinary symptoms?

History taking forms the cornerstone of the assessment of urinary symptoms, and this is summarised as a checklist in Table 5.

Recommendation: Neurologists should actively ask about urinary symptoms in individuals with neurological diseases on a regular basis. (Good practice statement; Consensus: 100%).

Clinical Question 2. Should individuals with neurological disease reporting urinary symptoms undergo a focused physical examination versus not undergoing a physical examination?

Individuals reporting urinary symptoms should undergo a targeted physical examination at initial evaluation, which is repeated annually in moderate or high‐risk individuals. The examination helps to plan investigations and treatments and screen for complications.

Recommendation: Neurologists should perform a targeted physical examination in individuals with neurological diseases and urinary symptoms. (Good practice statement; Consensus: 94%).

Clinical Question 3. Should individuals with neurological disease reporting urinary symptoms undergo a urinalysis versus not undergoing a urinalysis?

Screening urinalysis, which includes physical, chemical (dipstick testing) and/or microscopic evaluation of urine, should be a part of the initial evaluation when an individual reports urinary symptoms. The urine should be tested at follow‐up in case of significant changes in urinary symptoms. Urinalysis is more useful to exclude UTIs, and when a UTI is suspected, the urine should be sent for culture. Urinalysis should not be routinely performed to screen for UTIs in individuals who are using a catheter, given the high prevalence of asymptomatic bacteriuria and leukocyturia. Urine dipstick testing can also screen for glucosuria, proteinuria, and microscopic haematuria, prompting further investigations if persistent and unexplained.

Aims

Recommendations for the management of women with suspected uncomplicated lower urinary tract infections (UTIs) include presumptive antibiotics with or without obtaining a urine culture (UCx). However, with increasing antibiotic resistance, efforts to decrease antibiotic usage are vital. Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine if the presumptive treatment of women with suspected uncomplicated UTIs is contributing to unnecessary antibiotic usage.

Methods

We retrospectively reviewed all nonpregnant female patients presenting to our student health services clinic with UTI symptoms from December 2016 to May 2017 who had UCx sent. Clinical information, symptoms, office urine dip, and UCx results were reviewed. Patients with positive and negative UCx were compared.

Results

A total of 67 patients were included for analysis. Presenting symptoms included dysuria (59/60, 98%), frequency (41/45, 91%), and urgency (27/27, 100%). Office urine dip was performed on 33 of 67 (49%) patients. Dips were positive for leukocytes (88%), blood (79%), and nitrites (18%). All patients in the study were prescribed antibiotics, most commonly nitrofurantoin (82%). Culture results were negative in 29 of 67 (43%). There were no significant differences in duration of symptoms, presenting symptoms, or urine dip results between patients with a negative UCx and those with a positive UCx.

Conclusions

In our study, we found a significant negative UCx rate in women with symptoms of uncomplicated UTI, representing a cohort of patients who were exposed to antibiotics unnecessarily. In addition, we found no difference in presenting symptoms or urine dip results to help distinguish patients with a positive UCx.

Corynebacterium species, typically considered contaminants in urine culture, can cause encrusted cystitis (EC), a form of chronic urinary tract infection causing pain, bladder necrosis, renal failure, and death. Delayed diagnosis is common due to its rarity and the fastidious nature of Corynebacterium urealyticum. Reported mostly in elderly and immunocompromised patients, EC is rare in pediatric patients. A female adolescent on high dose steroids developed persistent dysuria after urinary catheterization. Abnormal bladder ultrasound and characteristic cystoscopy led to the diagnosis of EC. Appropriate treatment instituted 4 months from onset of dysuria led to an excellent response.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^113C4q31]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Recurrent urinary tract infection (rUTI) — definition and diagnostic criteria emphasize that this Guideline supports the most commonly used definition of two episodes of acute bacterial cystitis within a six-month period sometime within the preceding year, and any patient experiencing episodes of symptomatic acute cystitis after previous resolution of similar symptoms meets the criteria for rUTI. Strong evidence suggests that the diagnosis of acute bacterial cystitis should include the combination of acute-onset symptoms referable to the urinary tract, urinary inflammation on microscopic urinalysis (pyuria), and laboratory confirmation of significant bacteriuria, with Table 1 detailing components such as acute-onset symptoms including dysuria with increased urgency and frequency, hematuria, and new or worsening incontinence; urinary tract inflammation defined as pyuria ≥ 5 WBC/high power field (hpf) on microscopic urinalysis; and detection of a bacterial uropathogen. Without symptoms, bacteriuria of any magnitude is considered asymptomatic bacteriuria, and patients who recur rapidly within two weeks of initial treatment or who display bacterial persistence without symptom resolution may require imaging, cystoscopy, or other further investigation for bacterial reservoirs.

Symptoms — dysuria is a key symptom of bacterial cystitis, and in young women there is a 90% probability of a UTI when she reports dysuria and frequency in the absence of vaginal discharge or irritation; history and examination increase UTI probability with dysuria (likelihood ratio [LR], 1.5; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2–2), frequency (LR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.1–3.3), hematuria (LR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.3–2.9), back pain (LR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.2–2.1), and costovertebral angle tenderness (LR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.1–2.5), whereas the probability is reduced with a history of vaginal discharge (LR, 0.3; 95% CI, 0.1–0.9) or vaginal irritation (LR, 0.2; 95% CI, 0.1–0.9); with aging, acute dysuria remains reliable, new-onset frequency or urgency correlates with UTI, and new-onset urinary incontinence should prompt evaluation for UTI, but worsening of chronic incontinence or other urinary symptoms are not reliably associated with UTI.

Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) are a common complaint in the general population with great impact on the quality of life. Besides the classical pathologies, there are less common causes that must be considered in the treatment approach for patients with LUTS. We present the case of a 30-year-old patient with multiple emergency department episodes with dysuria, urinary frequency, suprapubic pain and an episode of acute urinary retention. The blood and urine tests only revealed increased systemic inflammatory parameters. The ultrasound examination showed thickening of the bladder wall, and the CT scan revealed a retropubic abscess originating from a pubic symphysis osteomyelitis. A percutaneous drainage was performed and, after empirical antibiotic therapy, there was complete resolution of the clinical picture.

### Urinary tract infections in older women: a clinical review [^114AHHdU]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Asymptomatic bacteriuria and symptomatic urinary tract infections (UTIs) in older women are commonly encountered in outpatient practice.

Objective

To review management of asymptomatic bacteriuria and symptomatic UTI and review prevention of recurrent UTIs in older community-dwelling women.

Evidence Review

A search of Ovid (Medline, PsycINFO, Embase) for English-language human studies conducted among adults aged 65 years and older and published in peer-reviewed journals from 1946 to November 20, 2013.

Results

The clinical spectrum of UTIs ranges from asymptomatic bacteriuria, to symptomatic and recurrent UTIs, to sepsis associated with UTI requiring hospitalization. Recent evidence helps differentiate asymptomatic bacteriuria from symptomatic UTI. Asymptomatic bacteriuria is transient in older women, often resolves without any treatment, and is not associated with morbidity or mortality. The diagnosis of symptomatic UTI is made when a patient has both clinical features and laboratory evidence of a urinary infection. Absent other causes, patients presenting with any 2 of the following meet the clinical diagnostic criteria for symptomatic UTI: fever, worsened urinary urgency or frequency, acute dysuria, suprapubic tenderness, or costovertebral angle pain or tenderness. A positive urine culture (≥ 105 CFU/mL) with no more than 2 uropathogens and pyuria confirms the diagnosis of UTI. Risk factors for recurrent symptomatic UTI include diabetes, functional disability, recent sexual intercourse, prior history of urogynecologic surgery, urinary retention, and urinary incontinence. Testing for UTI is easily performed in the clinic using dipstick tests. When there is a low pretest probability of UTI, a negative dipstick result for leukocyte esterase and nitrites excludes infection. Antibiotics are selected by identifying the uropathogen, knowing local resistance rates, and considering adverse effect profiles. Chronic suppressive antibiotics for 6 to 12 months and vaginal estrogen therapy effectively reduce symptomatic UTI episodes and should be considered in patients with recurrent UTIs.

Conclusions and Relevance

Establishing a diagnosis of symptomatic UTI in older women requires careful clinical evaluation with possible laboratory assessment using urinalysis and urine culture. Asymptomatic bacteriuria should be differentiated from symptomatic UTI. Asymptomatic bacteriuria in older women should not be treated.

### Effectiveness of five different approaches in management of urinary tract infection: randomised controlled trial [^116WfkPT]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To assess the impact of different management strategies in urinary tract infections.

Design

Randomised controlled trial.

Setting

Primary care.

Participants

309 non-pregnant women aged 18–70 presenting with suspected urinary tract infection.

Intervention

Patients were randomised to five management approaches: empirical antibiotics; empirical delayed (by 48 hours) antibiotics; or targeted antibiotics based on a symptom score (two or more of urine cloudiness, urine smell, nocturia, or dysuria), a dipstick result (nitrite or both leucocytes and blood), or a positive result on midstream urine analysis. Self help advice was controlled in each group.

Main Outcome Measures

Symptom severity (days 2 to 4) and duration, and use of antibiotics.

Results

Patients had 3.5 days of moderately bad symptoms if they took antibiotics immediately. There were no significant differences in duration or severity of symptoms (mean frequency of symptoms on a 0 to 6 scale: immediate antibiotics 2.15, midstream urine 2.08, dipstick 1.74, symptom score 1.77, delayed antibiotics 2.11; likelihood ratio test for the five groups P = 0.177). There were differences in antibiotic use (immediate antibiotics 97%, midstream urine 81%, dipstick 80%, symptom score 90%, delayed antibiotics 77%; P = 0.011) and in sending midstream urine samples (immediate antibiotics 23%, midstream urine 89%, dipstick 36%, symptom score 33%, delayed antibiotics 15%; P < 0.001). Patients who waited at least 48 hours to start taking antibiotics reconsulted less (hazard ratio 0.57 (95% confidence interval 0.36 to 0.89), P = 0.014) but on average had symptoms for 37% longer than those taking immediate antibiotics (incident rate ratio 1.37 (1.11 to 1.68), P = 0.003), particularly the midstream urine group (73% longer, 22% to 140%; none of the other groups had more than 22% longer duration).

Conclusion

All management strategies achieve similar symptom control. There is no advantage in routinely sending midstream urine samples for testing, and antibiotics targeted with dipstick tests with a delayed prescription as backup, or empirical delayed prescription, can help to reduce antibiotic use.

Follow-up evaluation in recurrent urinary tract infection — clinicians should not perform a post-treatment test of cure urinalysis or urine culture in asymptomatic patients (Expert Opinion). The Panel does not endorse microbiological reassessment after successful UTI treatment as this may lead to overtreatment, and it should again be emphasized that symptom clearance is sufficient. The Panel recognizes certain scenarios that may prompt screening such as planned surgical intervention in which mucosal bleeding is anticipated. In patients with rapid recurrence (particularly with the same organism), clinicians may consider evaluation on and off therapy, and repeated infection with bacteria associated with struvite stone formation (e.g. P. mirabilis) may prompt consideration of imaging to rule out calculus.

### Carcinoma in situ within the bladder trigone with an isolated metastasis to the prostate without involvement of prostatic urethra: a unique case report [^115oheAw]. BMC Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Carcinoma in situ (CIS) of the bladder, first described by Melicow MM. in 1952, is recognized as a malignant bladder condition carrying a significant risk for disease progression and increased mortality due to bladder cancer. It can be identified at various times, including (1) Primary CIS, when there's no previous bladder cancer history; (2) Concomitant CIS, when it's found at the same time as non-muscle-invasive (NMIBC) or muscle-invasive (MIBC) bladder cancers; and (3) Secondary CIS, when it's detected in follow-up in patients who have had bladder cancer before. Having a first-degree relative who has been diagnosed with bladder cancer significantly increases the risk of developing the disease. The patient's father's death from bladder cancer further emphasizes the potential hereditary risk factors associated with the condition. While it's known that smoking can elevate the risk of developing bladder cancer by up to fivefold, in this instance, the patient has no history of smoking. Due to the lack of a specific screening test for bladder cancer, the diagnostic process frequently depends upon the recognition of some clinical manifestation in primary healthcare settings. Shephard EA and colleagues' study among those patients revealed seven distinct characteristics that were independently predictive of bladder cancer, which were gross hematuria, dysuria, urinary tract infection, leukocytosis, abdominal pain, elevated inflammatory markers, and elevated creatinine levels. The Expert Panel of the American Urological Association has described asymptomatic microscopic hematuria as identifying "three or more red blood cells per high-power field" when examining urinary sediment under a microscope, from at least two of three urine samples collected correctly. In this case, the initial urinalysis revealed 60–80 RBCs per field with positive hemoglobin, in conjunction with gross hematuria. A follow-up urinalysis four weeks later still showed 8–10 RBCs per field. And thus, further testing was pursued to determine the cause of the patient's persistent microscopic hematuria. Roughly 75% of bladder cancer patients exhibit intermittent hematuria that is painless. Studies suggest that around 20% of individuals assessed for gross hematuria will end up with a diagnosis of bladder cancer. In cases where patients have non-visible, microscopic blood traces in the urine, there's about a 10% chance they will be found to have bladder cancer. The clinical assessment of the spread of UC can be challenging, but combining the histopathological reports with imaging methods such as Ultrasonography (USG), computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can aid in determining the size and extent of the primary tumor and identifying any metastases to lymph nodes or distant organs. The occurrence of primary initial CIS of the prostate is exceptionally uncommon. Around 90% of prostatic CIS cases are detected alongside either papillary or invasive urothelial carcinoma (UC), commonly situated in the bladder, as the presence of bladder CIS elevates the risk of concurrent prostatic CIS. Accurately assessing the full extent of CIS within the prostate is crucial. For optimal results, a biopsy should be taken from the prostatic urethra using a resectoscope with a loop electrode, focusing on regions at the 5 and 7 o'clock marks stretching from the bladder neck to the verumontanum, which includes the areas of the ejaculatory ducts. Such a procedure is key to detecting whether the CIS has invaded the prostatic ducts (pdCIS) or infiltrated the prostatic stroma (psCIS), while it's also noted that in 20% of cases, CIS remains localized to just the prostatic urethra (puCIS). Stromal invasion is associated with poorer survival compared to non-invasive disease, with a 15-year survival rate of 82% for patients without invasion, whereas it drops to 48% for those with stromal invasion. In this instance, the prostatic urethra was clear of any malignancy; however, a solitary metastasis was identified within the prostatic ducts. The mechanisms behind this selective metastasis may be linked to the anatomy of the prostatic ducts and their fluid dynamics, or possibly due to the expression of specific adhesion molecules or growth factors that facilitate the migration of cancer cells to this location. Primary UC typically presents with positive GATA-3 marker results, which aligns with the findings in this particular case. This lesion progressed to invade the peripheral zone of the prostate, at which point it was reclassified from CIS, and thus required the implementation of an aggressive approach to treatment. Research comprising numerous trials and meta-analyses regarding radical cystectomy for treating locally advanced bladder cancer strongly supports its efficacy, with a notable increase in the survival rates without recurrence among these patients. The critical factor in achieving optimal outcomes following radical cystectomy is the proficiency with which the procedure is performed. Early cystoprostatectomy in patients with minimal stromal involvement and organ-confined bladder cancer may lead to improved survival rates. Studies by Herr and Donat, as well as Esrig et al. have shown better survival outcomes in patients with prostatic stromal invasion through the intraurethral route (ranging from 64.6 to 75%) compared to non-organ-confined "extravesical" bladder tumors (ranging from 13.6 to 9%). Radical cystectomy alone is often insufficient to cure locally advanced bladder cancer (T3-T4a N0M0), making adjuvant chemotherapy highly recommended to reduce the risk of recurrence. Both methotrexate/vinblastine/doxorubicin/cisplatin (MVAC) and gemcitabine and cisplatin (GC) chemotherapy combinations are utilized, but GC has demonstrated superior safety and improved 5-year survival statistics, thus it is now favored over the MVAC regimen.

### Lower urinary tract symptoms revisited: a broader clinical perspective [^111fFx4y]. European Urology (2008). Low credibility.

Context

The term "lower urinary tract symptoms" (LUTS) was introduced to dissociate male urinary symptoms from any implied site of symptom origin, such as the prostate.

Objective

To consider a more expansive view of LUTS, moving beyond an organocentric focus.

Evidence Acquisition

Review of the available literature by a consensus panel.

Evidence Synthesis

A consensus group reviewed the literature and developed a conceptual framework to facilitate research and clinical practice in patients with LUTS, following steps outlined in the Delphi procedure. Committee discussion, with presentations and review of existing literature and knowledge at four separate occasions, and extensive review and discussion of draft documents encapsulating group views followed. Consensus group findings included evidence that LUTS increase with age and are prevalent in both male and female patients, with differences in the prevalence of individual storage, voiding, and postmicturition symptoms representing underlying pathophysiologic factors between the sexes. Additionally, it was recognised that patients often have underlying and overlapping pathophysiologic mechanisms that may be related to the expression of LUTS and that this global approach to LUTS reflects our contemporary recognition of the lower urinary tract as an integrated functional unit. To improve the current management of patients, education and awareness regarding LUTS, its causes, and associated comorbidities are needed. Major limitations of this work are the potential interpretive bias introduced by prior perceptions and the nature of the study populations drawn conventionally from secondary care.

Conclusions

In conclusion, it is misleading to attribute individual symptoms to sex differences or to a specific underlying organ. LUTS are a non-sex-specific, non-organ-specific group of symptoms, which are sometimes age-related and progressive. A need exists to increase education and awareness regarding LUTS, its causes, and associated comorbidities, and to assess and treat men and women for all LUTS, not just selected symptoms.

### Updates to microhematuria: AUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^114yLxJ6]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Microhematuria — dipstick versus microscopy: Clinicians should not define microhematuria by positive dipstick testing alone, and a positive urine dipstick test (trace blood or greater) should prompt formal microscopic evaluation of the urine; this is a Strong Recommendation with Evidence Level: Grade C. The Panel emphasizes that a positive dipstick merits microscopic examination of the urinary sediment but does not warrant full evaluation unless microscopic evaluation confirms ≥ 3 RBC/HPF, and if suspicion persists, repeat microscopic testing may be reasonable after assessing patient risk and preference. Supporting data note that in a series of 237 female patients with a positive dipstick, 20.3% had a normal urinalysis, and amongst 54 patients referred for microhematuria evaluations based solely on a positive dipstick, only 14 (26%) had a positive urinalysis result.

### Cross-over data supporting long-term antibiotic treatment in patients with painful lower urinary tract symptoms, pyuria and negative urinalysis [^116vrr3E]. International Urogynecology Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Recalcitrant chronic bladder pain and symptoms of recurrent cystitis in patients with negative urinalysis present a worrying management problem. The treatment of painful lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) is a significant challenge, and there are few quality data to guide clinicians. The evidence for oral or intravesical therapies for painful bladder symptoms is poor. Cystodistension and urethral dilation are also deployed without evidence to support their utility. Patients with recurrent, acute symptoms of cystitis and negative urinalysis are often exposed to multiple, short courses of antibiotics in primary care without evidence of benefit.

While there are published guidelines for managing acute and recurrent urinary tract infection (UTI), there are none for patients who may be suffering a chronic form of the disease. Recently, we published data describing our experience treating women with chronic painful LUTS for a mean duration of 6 years prior to presentation to our clinic. These patients had been exposed to conventional therapies without a resolution of symptoms. Data were gathered from 624 patients over 10 years. Given microscopic pyuria and symptoms, we presumed an infectious cause even in the face of negative dipstick urinalysis and urine cultures, as these tests lack sensitivity and fail to detect infective organisms in bona fide disease. This previous report described the evolution of a simple management regimen using first-generation, narrow-spectrum, urinary antibiotics combined with methenamine hippurate, guided by symptom palliation and the resolution of pyuria. The study demonstrated that treatment was associated with symptomatic improvement and the resolution of biomarkers of infection. There were few treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) and no significant increase in antibiotic-resistant isolates. These data are being employed to develop a randomised trial (RCT).

### Cost effectiveness of management strategies for urinary tract infections: results from randomised controlled trial [^1155Y44y]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Methods

Randomised controlled trial

General practitioners or practice nurses recruited patients with suspected urinary tract infection, either first time or recurrent, on presentation. The study included 309 non-pregnant adult women aged 18–70. The practitioner collected baseline symptoms, clinical information, and demographic details. Patients completed a symptom diary for 14 days. Patients were randomised to one of five management groups: empirical antibiotic treatment; empirical delayed antibiotics; antibiotic targeted by symptom score; antibiotic according to dipstick algorithm (nitrites or leucocytes and a trace of blood); or midstream urine analysis with symptomatic treatment until culture and sensitivity results were available and then antibiotics targeted accordingly. Full details of this trial are given elsewhere.

### Microbiologist in the clinic: antibiotic dependent in her 30 s [^117989Xx]. International Urogynecology Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

In this third episode of the Microbiologist in the Clinic series, clinicians and laboratory scientists share their perspectives about a 32 y/o female who has become antibiotic-dependent for her urinary symptoms. Despite escalating methods of antibiotic administration, the patient has persistent and recurrent "UTI" symptoms. Extensive testing has not provided guidance for her treating clinicians. The challenges of this clinical presentation are discussed with evidence for evaluation and treatment.

Symptom control

The upper confidence intervals for the main outcome (frequency symptoms) suggest that alternative strategies are unlikely to result in poor symptom control (around 18% worsening for the midstream urine or delayed groups, and 2% in dipstick and symptom score groups). There was some evidence that if women waited more than 48 hour they reconsulted less but had poorer control of symptoms, particularly for the midstream urine group. The finding of worse symptoms in such patients is in agreement with evidence of the effect of antibiotics from observational studies and trials. Why the delayed group who waited a similar time did not have increased symptoms, however, is unclear. This might be a chance finding, but it might be because women in the midstream urine group find passively waiting for a laboratory result to be more distressing than being given the freedom to choose when to stop the delay according to their symptoms (the empirical delayed group). A previous study treated women negative for nitrite and leucocyte esterase with antibiotics and found symptomatic benefit, but as about a third of women who have negative results for all important dipstick tests (that is, not only nitrite and leucocyte but also blood) still have urinary tract infection based on rigorous laboratory confirmation, the finding of a benefit in women with negative dipstick resultsmight be expected. The poor negative predictive value of dipsticks suggests that the offer of some kind of antibiotic safety net — such as delayed prescribing — to women with negative dipstick results is reasonable.

Antibiotic use

A modest reduction in antibiotic use (20–25%) was achieved in all groups except the symptom score group. While these reductions are probably useful for public health, and the effect might plausibly increase with time as patient expectations change, the magnitude of the effect is in contrast to delayed antibiotic prescription among patients with respiratory infections. This is perhaps not surprising given that few respiratory infections are bacterial whereas most suspected urinary tract infections are (66% of the midstream urine group had confirmed infection, similar to the previous study). There was some evidence that delayed prescribing might reduce reconsultation as we hypothesised, but this was not significant, probably because of the relatively low power of this analysis.

### Pregnant patient in the emergency department: an observational investigation of predictive values of symptoms and lab measures in predicting culture confirmed urinary tract infection [^111FPAyC]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Many women in their first trimester present to the Emergency Department (ED) for evaluation. Urinalysis is a common test performed with these patients to evaluate for possible UTI. There are no clear results to determine if a patient requires antibiotic in the ED vs waiting for the culture result to start antibiotics. We prospectively studied a convenience sample of 198 women in their first trimester of pregnancy presenting to a community ED recording standard symptoms and lab analysis and then compared these results to the urine culture. We determined that no single symptom was significantly sensitive nor specific for ruling in or out UTI. Overall, the presence of Nitrites was the most significant with a specificity of 98.6%, NPV of 81.9% and PPV of 86.6%. Presence of specific historical findings, namely dysuria (88% specificity) and hematuria (93% specificity) performed well for predicting culture positive UTI but performed poorly in ruling out this condition. The diagnosis of a culture confirmed UTI in the ED cannot be reliably predicted using symptomology or labs values other than nitrates.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^11549KRB]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

AUA/CUA/SUFU guideline — urinary tract infection (UTI) symptoms note that acute-onset symptoms attributable to the urinary tract typically include dysuria in conjunction with variable degrees of increased urinary urgency and frequency, hematuria, and new or worsening incontinence. Dysuria (urethral burning during voiding) is central in the diagnosis of UTI, and acute-onset dysuria is a specific symptom, with more than 90% accuracy for UTI in young women in the absence of concomitant vaginal irritation or increased vaginal discharge. Dysuria can have other causes (e.g., atrophic vaginitis, pelvic floor myofascial pain, vulvar lichen sclerosus), and the specificity of this symptom outside of this narrow population has not been defined. In older adults, the symptoms of UTI may be less clear, and careful evaluation of their chronicity becomes an important consideration when the diagnosis of UTI is in doubt.

### Diagnostic stewardship cutoffs for urinalysis results prior to performing a urine culture: analysis of data from a healthcare system [^115CN7xE]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Our study has limitations. The urinalysis parameters were assessed to identify uropathogens rather than to diagnose UTIs clinically. UTI diagnosis requires the presence of symptoms (eg, dysuria), which were not analyzed in this study given patient symptoms were in nonformatted text within the patient's medical record. Although it may be ideal to include clinical symptomatology in conjunction with urinalysis parameters to refine diagnostic accuracy further, our primary focus was on diagnostic stewardship, specifically examining how clinical microbiology laboratories could reduce unnecessary urine cultures while minimizing non-performance of urine specimens that may represent true infections, consistent with prior similar studies.– Additionally, quantitative information about urine culture colony growth was unavailable for our analysis due to information not present in structured fields within the electronic medical record. Although the use of quantitative thresholds is typically used when defining positive urine cultures, it should be noted that colony counts down to 1000 CFU/mL can represent a UTI. Another limitation is that our analysis only included urinalysis specimens that had microscopic analysis. However, urinalysis without microscopy occurs largely when urinalysis leukocyte is negative, suggesting that our analysis excludes patients unlikely to have a UTI. Lastly, our patient population consists of a safety net population in Southern California, which may not reflect care delivery patterns or patient demographics in other locales.

In conclusion, our findings support the use of WBC as the most reliable parameter for reflex urine culture algorithms. This single, simple parameter performs reasonably well in common care settings and across different ages. Our analysis also provides guidance as to expectations of urinary cultures performed and prevented when various WBC cutoffs are implemented. Our findings suggest that a cutoff of 10 WBCs/HPF, as suggested by others, may be a "sweet spot" that prevents a sizable proportion of urine cultures that do not yield uropathogens with minimal impact for isolating uropathogens. Future studies examining patient outcomes and safety after reflex urine culture algorithm implementation in diverse patient populations and settings will provide important information about its value in real world settings.

### Urinalysis: case presentations for the primary care physician [^112tVSnf]. American Family Physician (2014). Low credibility.

Urinalysis is useful in diagnosing systemic and genitourinary conditions. In patients with suspected microscopic hematuria, urine dipstick testing may suggest the presence of blood, but results should be confirmed with a microscopic examination. In the absence of obvious causes, the evaluation of microscopic hematuria should include renal function testing, urinary tract imaging, and cystoscopy. In a patient with a ureteral stent, urinalysis alone cannot establish the diagnosis of urinary tract infection. Plain radiography of the kidneys, ureters, and bladder can identify a stent and is preferred over computed tomography. Asymptomatic bacteriuria is the isolation of bacteria in an appropriately collected urine specimen obtained from a person without symptoms of a urinary tract infection. Treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria is not recommended in nonpregnant adults, including those with prolonged urinary catheter use.

Recurrent urinary tract infection — urine culture diagnostic thresholds and reporting: A positive urine culture is typically characterized by bacteriuria of at least 10⁵ colony-forming units (CFU)/mL, although according to the European Association of Urology guidelines, a count of 10² CFU/mL in symptomatic patients is sufficient for diagnosis; Canadian guidelines state that even 10² CFU is sufficient in the setting of UTI symptoms, and certain laboratories may report 10⁴ or less as "no growth".

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^112yE1He]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Urinalysis performance and interpretation in recurrent urinary tract infection (UTI) — A negative urinalysis (i.e., negative nitrites and < 5 WBC/hpf) is useful in ruling out acute cystitis and is associated with a very low risk of progression to bacteremia; in a study of more than 12,000 urinalyses, a negative urinalysis showed high predictive accuracy for absence of clinically relevant UTI with specificity 92.2% and positive predictive value (PPV) 97.4%, and stewardship programs that reflex culture only after a positive urinalysis are estimated to reduce inappropriate antibiotics by five-fold; by contrast, positive leukocyte esterase (≥ 1+), pyuria (≥ 10 WBC/hpf), nitrite (≥ 1+), and bacteriuria (≥ 50 cells/field) all have PPVs for UTI lower than 50%, and discordance such as urine culture with > 100,000 CFU/mL E. coli but absent urine nitrites may reflect sampling or handling issues, where identifying epithelial cells or mucus can suggest contamination and obtaining a catheterized specimen may be reasonable; overall, urinalysis is specifically helpful due to its high negative predictive value, but positive findings should not be interpreted as evidence of a clinically significant UTI.

### Assessment of microscopic hematuria in adults [^115UnMZX]. American Family Physician (2006). Low credibility.

Microscopic hematuria, a common finding on routine urinalysis of adults, is clinically significant when three to five red blood cells per high-power field are visible. Etiologies of microscopic hematuria range from incidental causes to life-threatening urinary tract neoplasm. The lack of evidence-based imaging guidelines can complicate the family physician's decision about the best way to proceed. Patients with proteinuria, red cell casts, and elevated serum creatinine levels should be referred promptly to a nephrology subspecialist. Microscopic hematuria with signs of urinary tract infection should resolve with appropriate treatment of the underlying infection. Patients with asymptomatic microscopic hematuria or with hematuria persisting after treatment of urinary tract infection also need to be evaluated. Because upper and lower urinary tract pathologies often coexist, patients should be evaluated using cytology plus intravenous urography, computed tomography, or ultrasonography. When urine cytology results are abnormal, cystoscopy should be performed to complete the investigation.

### Response to antibiotics of women with symptoms of urinary tract infection but negative dipstick urine test results: double blind randomised controlled trial [^116MibYa]. BMJ (2005). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To assess the effectiveness of antibiotic treatment of women with symptoms of urinary tract infection but negative urine dipstick testing.

Design

Prospective, double blind, randomised, placebo controlled trial.

Setting

Primary care, among a randomly selected group of general practitioners in Christchurch, New Zealand.

Participants

59 women aged 16–50 years presenting with a history of dysuria and frequency in whom a dipstick test of midstream urine was negative for both nitrites and leucocytes. Participants with complicated urinary tract infection were excluded.

Intervention

Trimethoprim 300 mg daily for three days or placebo.

Main Outcome Measures

Self reported diary of symptoms for seven days, recording the presence or absence of individual symptoms each day, followed by a structured telephone questionnaire after seven days. The main clinical outcome was resolution of dysuria at three and seven days and median time to resolution. Secondary outcomes were resolution of other symptoms.

Results

The median time for resolution of dysuria was three days for trimethoprim compared with five days for placebo (P = 0.002). At day 3, five (24%) of patients in the treatment group had ongoing dysuria compared with 20 (74%) in the placebo group (P = 0.005). This difference persisted until day 7: two patients (10%) in the treatment group v 11 (41%) in the placebo group; P = 0.02). The number needed to treat was 4. The median duration of constitutional symptoms (feverishness, shivers) was reduced by four days.

Conclusions

Although a negative dipstick test for leucocytes and nitrites accurately predicted absence of infection when standard microbiological definitions were used (negative predictive value 92%), it did not predict response to antibiotic treatment. Three days' treatment with trimethoprim significantly reduced dysuria in women whose urine dipstick test was negative. These results support the practice of empirical antibiotic use guided by symptoms. Balancing the competing interests of symptom relief and the minimisation of antibiotic use remains a dilemma-further research is needed to determine clinical predictors of response to antibiotics.

### Accuracy of urinary symptoms and urine microscopy in diagnosing urinary tract infection in women [^1146S4Vh]. Family Practice (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Women with urinary tract infections (UTIs) often present with urinary complaints such as frequency of micturition, dysuria, foul-smelling urine and other non-specific symptoms like fever. Physicians may order urine microscopy to guide empirical antibiotic prescription. However, the performance of this approach has not been assessed.

Objectives

This study aimed to determine the accuracy of UTI symptoms and urine microscopy associated with culture-positive UTI in Asian women.

Methods

A cross-sectional study of adult women who presented with UTI-related symptoms was conducted at three public primary care clinics in Singapore. Demographic data and information on their symptoms were collected, followed by urine microscopy and culture to diagnose UTI. The sensitivity, specificity, positive (PPV), negative predictive values (NPV), accuracy (ACC) and area under curve (AUC) of combinations of symptom and urine investigations were analysed in association with culture-positive UTI, which was regarded as a benchmark.

Results

Data on 564 women (73.9% Chinese, 11.5% Malay, 8.2% Indian) were analysed, of which 259 (45.9%) had culture-positive UTI. Frequency and foul-smelling urine, pyuria (WBC ≥ 10/hpf) and semi-quantitative bacterial count (≥ 2+) were significantly associated with positive urine culture. The ACC and AUC for single or multiple urinary and/or general symptoms were low. Urine pyuria (minimally > 10/hpf) alone or in combination with symptoms and/or semi-quantitative bacterial count achieved high sensitivity (> 85%) and PPV, NPV, ACC and AUC of > 70%.

Conclusion

Urinary symptoms have limited accuracy in diagnosing culture-positive UTI. Concurrent urine microscopy showing presence of pyuria and/or bacterial count increased the diagnostic accuracy of culture-positive UTI.

### The inadequacy of urinary dipstick and microscopy as surrogate markers of urinary tract infection in urological outpatients with lower urinary tract symptoms without acute frequency and dysuria [^111ipgfa]. The Journal of Urology (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose

Diagnosing urinary infection in patients with chronic lower urinary tract symptoms without dysuria is a critical step. In this study we scrutinize the sensitivity and specificity of dipstick urinalysis and microscopic pyuria (10 or more white blood cells per microl) to identify infection in such patients.

Materials and Methods

This was a prospective, blinded, observational cohort study of urological outpatients with painless lower urinary tract symptoms. Midstream and catheter urine samples were analyzed. A total of 508 midstream urine samples were used to compare leukocyte esterase, nitrite dipstick and urine microscopy with cultures seeking 10⁵ cfu/ml. Similarly 470 catheter urine samples were used to compare the same surrogates with 10⁵ cfu/ml and with an enhanced culture method seeking 10² cfu/ml. A comparison of leukocyte esterase against microscopic pyuria was made using the 508 midstream and 470 catheter specimens of urine. Midstream urine specimens were provided by 42 normal volunteers for comparison.

Results

For a midstream urine culture at 10⁵ cfu/ml leukocyte esterase was 56% sensitive, nitrite was 10% sensitive and microscopic pyuria was 56% sensitive. Specificities were 66%, 99% and 72%, respectively. For a catheter specimen of urine culture at 10⁵ cfu/ml leukocyte esterase was 59% sensitive, nitrite was 20% sensitive and microscopic pyuria was 66% sensitive. Specificities were 84%, 97% and 73%, respectively. The enhanced culture of catheter specimen of urine at 10² cfu/ml was positive in 29% of patients vs 15% at 10⁵ cfu/ml.

Conclusions

Despite official guidelines and widespread use these tests cannot be considered appropriate for diagnosing urinary tract infection in patients with lower urinary tract symptoms, and should be abandoned in this context.
