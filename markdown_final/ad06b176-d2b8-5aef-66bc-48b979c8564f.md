## Question

Combined birth control and migraine with aura

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether combined hormonal contraception (CHC) is safe to use in someone with migraine with aura, and if not, what the evidence shows and what alternatives are recommended. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the baseline stroke risk in migraine with aura. Then, I should verify how CHC independently affects stroke risk. Next, I will examine the magnitude of the combined risk when both are present. After that, I need to check guideline positions and regulatory labeling. Finally, I will consider modifiers like age, smoking, and estrogen dose, and then outline safer contraceptive alternatives and counseling points, including absolute risk framing and shared decision-making.

> Let me first confirm the baseline risk in migraine with aura. Multiple high-quality meta-analyses and large cohort studies consistently show that migraine with aura doubles the risk of ischemic stroke, with pooled relative risks around 2.1 to 2.3, and this risk is stronger in women and in those younger than 45 years [^1177oyT6] [^112HU1sw] [^115LNvMy].

> I need to check the independent effect of CHC on stroke. Observational data indicate that CHC use is associated with a roughly 2- to 4-fold increase in ischemic stroke risk, with risk rising with higher estrogen dose and in the presence of other vascular risk factors such as hypertension and smoking [^115jBCtr] [^115G6YnC] [^115Yruv2].

> Now, I will examine the joint effect. The most robust case-control data show that combining migraine with aura and CHC yields about a 6-fold increased risk of ischemic stroke compared with women who have neither exposure, with an absolute risk of approximately 37 per 100,000 person-years in women aged 20–44, compared with about 2.5 per 100,000 in those with neither condition, and this association is consistent across sensitivity analyses and guideline summaries [^114LjaY2] [^113H816C] [^1177oyT6].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should confirm how guidelines translate this into practice. The U.S. Medical Eligibility Criteria classify migraine with aura as a category 4 condition for CHC, meaning CHC should not be used because of unacceptable health risk, while migraine without aura is category 2, where benefits generally outweigh risks when no other stroke risk factors are present [^114UY9hT] [^116qxog4]. The 2024 AHA/ASA stroke prevention guideline similarly recommends progestin-only or nonhormonal contraception in adults with migraine with aura to avoid the increased ischemic stroke risk from CHC, and FDA labeling for multiple CHC products lists migraine with aura as a contraindication [^113r2HbD] [^112joXwK] [^115RPFSp] [^111TTX3v].

> Wait, let me verify modifiers that amplify risk. Age under 35 years still carries elevated relative risk, but absolute risk remains low. Smoking compounds the risk multiplicatively, and higher estrogen doses further increase stroke risk, which is why, when CHC is considered in other contexts, lower-dose ethinyl estradiol is preferred, though this does not make CHC safe in migraine with aura [^115Yruv2] [^115G6YnC] [^114tHSv2].

> I should double-check the mechanistic plausibility. Migraine with aura involves cortical spreading depression and endothelial dysfunction, and CHC increases thrombogenicity. Together, these create a prothrombotic milieu that plausibly elevates ischemic stroke risk, particularly in young women, which aligns with the epidemiologic signal and supports the strength of recommendation [^112695zQ] [^1177oyT6].

> Next, I should review safer alternatives. Progestin-only methods, including the pill, injectables, implants, and levonorgestrel IUD, are category 1 for migraine with aura, indicating no restriction, and observational data suggest no increased ischemic stroke risk with progestin-only contraception. Copper IUD is also category 1 and is a nonhormonal option with excellent efficacy [^1166Pd6p] [^115hteJP] [^113H816C]. Let me consider symptom data too: small prospective studies suggest desogestrel POP may reduce migraine attack frequency and aura duration in some patients, though evidence quality is low and not required for safety decisions [^115yhZur] [^116TcGCz].

> I will now examine counseling and shared decision-making. I should confirm that patients understand absolute risk is low but clinically meaningful, especially when amplified by smoking or higher estrogen dose, and that the balance of risks favors avoiding CHC in migraine with aura. If a patient strongly prefers CHC, I need to ensure we document informed refusal, address modifiable risks like smoking, and consider the lowest feasible estrogen dose only in exceptional circumstances, recognizing this remains off-label and not guideline-supported [^113H816C] [^111thtin] [^115Yruv2].

> But wait, what if the patient is already on CHC and develops new-onset aura or worsening migraines? I should confirm that new aura, marked changes in headache pattern, or increasing frequency warrant reassessment and that many labels advise discontinuation of CHC in this scenario, reinforcing the need to switch to a safer method promptly [^115RPFSp] [^115RPFSp].

> In summary, I need to ensure the conclusion is precise: combined hormonal contraception is contraindicated in migraine with aura due to a consistent, approximately 6-fold increase in ischemic stroke risk, with guideline and regulatory support for category 4 classification. Progestin-only or nonhormonal contraception should be recommended instead, with individualized counseling on absolute risk, modifiers like smoking and age, and documentation of shared decision-making if the patient requests off-label CHC use despite counseling [^114LjaY2] [^114UY9hT] [^113r2HbD] [^113H816C].

---

Combined hormonal contraceptives (CHCs) are **contraindicated** for women with migraine with aura because they increase ischemic stroke risk about 6-fold [^114LjaY2] [^113H816C]. This risk is highest in women under 45, smokers, and those with additional vascular risk factors [^1177oyT6] [^115Yruv2]. Progestin-only or nonhormonal methods (copper IUD, levonorgestrel IUD, implant, DMPA, POP) are **safe alternatives** and are not associated with increased stroke risk [^1166Pd6p] [^113H816C]. If CHCs are already in use when aura appears, they should be stopped immediately, and patients should be counseled on stroke warning signs and risk-factor modification [^115RPFSp] [^113r2HbD].

---

## Evidence on stroke risk

Multiple high-quality studies and meta-analyses consistently show that CHC use in women with migraine with aura **significantly increases ischemic stroke risk**:

- **6-fold increase**: A large case-control study found a 6.1-fold increased risk of ischemic stroke in women with migraine with aura using CHCs compared to those with neither condition (OR 6.1, 95% CI 3.1–12.1) [^114LjaY2].

- **Absolute risk**: The absolute risk is 36.9 per 100,000 person-years in women aged 20–44 with migraine with aura using CHCs, versus 2.5 per 100,000 in women with neither condition [^113H816C].

- **Meta-analyses**: Systematic reviews and meta-analyses confirm a 2–4 fold increased stroke risk with CHCs in migraine with aura, with risk further amplified by smoking and age under 45 [^115jBCtr] [^114gpZ6A].

---

## Mechanisms underlying increased risk

The elevated stroke risk in migraine with aura plus CHCs likely reflects **synergistic effects**:

- **Aura-related mechanisms**: Cortical spreading depression and endothelial dysfunction in aura may predispose to ischemia [^112695zQ].

- **Estrogen effects**: CHCs increase thrombogenicity and vascular reactivity, compounding aura-related vulnerability [^115G6YnC].

- **Hypercoagulability**: Migraine with aura is linked to prothrombotic states, which CHCs may exacerbate [^112695zQ].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Major guidelines uniformly **advise against CHCs** in migraine with aura:

| **Guideline/source** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| U.S. Medical Eligibility Criteria (US MEC) 2024 | Category 4 (contraindicated) for CHCs in migraine with aura; progestin-only and nonhormonal methods are category 1 (no restriction) [^114UY9hT] [^1166Pd6p] |
| American Heart Association/American Stroke Association (AHA/ASA) 2024 | Strong recommendation (COR 1) to use progestin-only or nonhormonal contraception in migraine with aura to avoid increased ischemic stroke risk [^113r2HbD] [^112joXwK] |
| FDA labeling | Multiple CHC labels list migraine with aura as a contraindication [^115RPFSp] [^111TTX3v] |

---

## Alternative contraceptive options

Safe, effective alternatives include:

- **Progestin-only methods**: POPs, injectables (DMPA), implants, and levonorgestrel IUD are category 1 and do not increase stroke risk [^1166Pd6p] [^113H816C].

- **Nonhormonal methods**: Copper IUD is category 1 and highly effective [^115hteJP].

- **Counseling**: Discuss efficacy, side effects, and patient preferences to guide method selection [^notfound].

---

## Clinical management considerations

- **Screening**: Always screen for migraine with aura before prescribing CHCs [^111VfgkZ].

- **Discontinuation**: Stop CHCs immediately if aura develops or worsens during use [^117VyzqG].

- **Risk-factor modification**: Address smoking, hypertension, and other vascular risks [^113r2HbD].

- **Patient education**: Teach stroke warning signs and when to seek urgent care [^notfound].

---

## Summary of evidence

| **Risk factor** | **Stroke risk increase** |
|-|-|
| Migraine with aura alone | ~2-fold [^1177oyT6] |
| CHC use alone | ~2–4-fold [^115jBCtr] |
| Combined (migraine with aura + CHC) | ~6-fold [^114LjaY2] [^113H816C] |

---

Combined hormonal contraceptives are **contraindicated** in migraine with aura due to a markedly increased ischemic stroke risk; progestin-only or nonhormonal methods are preferred, and patients should be counseled on risk factors and warning signs [^114UY9hT] [^113r2HbD].

MIGRAINE, STROKE AND SPECIAL CONCERNS IN WOMEN

Migraine is a predominantly female disorder, affecting women with a ratio of approximately 3:1 to men. The highest 1-year prevalence of migraine is between ages of 25 and 55 years, and it is estimated that 22%–37% of women will experience migraine during their reproductive years. As the association between migraine and ischaemic stroke is particularly strong in women with MA under the age of 45, certain aspects during a woman's life need to be considered.

Migraine and oral contraceptives

Migraine is particularly prevalent in the fertile period when women opt for oral contraception. While the risks of venous thromboembolism in users of oral contraceptives are well established, the risks of cardiovascular arterial diseases are more uncertain. The safety of oral contraceptives in women with migraine remains controversial. Numerous studies report increased risk of ischaemic stroke in women with migraine who use oral contraceptive. Stronger associations are found for MA and in those with additional vascular risk factors. Particularly smoking combined with the use of oral contraceptives in young women with MA increase risk of ischaemic stroke. The risk of stroke in women taking oral contraceptives seems to correlate with the dose of oestrogen contained in the formulation. Caution should be warranted when interpreting the data on the risk of stroke in women with migraine using oral contraceptives; as migraine is often not diagnosed according to ICHD criteria, many studies do not distinguish between MA and MO, and the dose classification of oral contraceptives is often heterogeneous. Studies evaluating the effect of oral contraceptive use on the risk of haemorrhagic stroke is conflicting, and no firm conclusions can be made.

Clinical implication

For most women, modern oral contraceptives are safe and highly effective methods of contraception. Despite the overall low risk of stroke from oral contraceptives, certain subgroups of women, particularly those who have MA, are older than 35 years, smoke cigarettes or have other stroke risk factors, may be at higher risk. One should look for an underlying genetic or acquired coagulopathy in those with previous thromboembolism or risk factors for an underlying coagulopathy (eg, family history of thromboembolism, spontaneous abortion, history of malignancy). Type of oral contraceptive should also be taken into consideration, as the oestrogen content differs between products. New onset of migraine aura, new onset MO in temporal relationship to starting oral contraceptive, development of unusual aura symptoms or prolonged aura may necessitate further evaluation or cessation of oral contraceptives.

Migraine — Epidemiology and stroke risk evidence: Migraine affects 14.4% of individuals and disproportionately affects women 15 to 49 years of age with a prevalence between 20% and 30%, and an association between migraine, particularly migraine with aura, and stroke risk has consistently been identified in observational studies; this association is stronger for ischemic stroke than for hemorrhagic stroke and is more evident in young women. Four recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses including a combined total of 49 observational studies (28 cohort studies, 21 case-control studies) reported RRs ranging from 1.3 to 1.6 for any stroke and up to 1.5 for hemorrhagic stroke; migraine with aura confers higher risk for ischemic stroke with a pooled RR of 2.17 (95% CI, 1.78–2.64). A study using insurance claims data from 1.2 million US adults with migraine 18 to 64 years of age found that 18% were at either medium or high risk of vascular events according to comorbidities. Use of combined hormonal contraception in those with migraine with aura is associated with increased risk for ischemic stroke.

### Use of combined hormonal contraceptives among women with migraines and risk of ischemic stroke [^114LjaY2]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Migraine with aura and combined hormonal contraceptives are independently associated with an increased risk of ischemic stroke. However, little is known about whether there are any joint effects of migraine and hormonal contraceptives on risk of stroke.

Objective

We sought to estimate the incidence of stroke in women of reproductive age and examine the association among combined hormonal contraceptive use, migraine type (with or without aura), and ischemic stroke.

Study Design

This study used a nationwide health care claims database and employed a nested case-control study design. Females ages 15–49 years with first-ever stroke during 2006 through 2012 were identified using the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification inpatient services diagnosis codes. Four controls were matched to each case based on age. Migraine headache with and without aura was identified using inpatient or outpatient diagnosis codes. Current combined hormonal contraceptive use was identified using the National Drug Code from the pharmacy database. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals of ischemic stroke by migraine type and combined hormonal contraceptive use.

Results

From 2006 through 2012, there were 25,887 ischemic strokes among females ages 15–49 years, for a cumulative incidence of 11 strokes/100,000 females. Compared to those with neither migraine nor combined hormonal contraceptive use, the odds ratio of ischemic stroke was highest among those with migraine with aura using combined hormonal contraceptives (odds ratio, 6.1; 95% confidence interval, 3.1–12.1); odds ratios were also elevated for migraine with aura without combined hormonal contraceptive use (odds ratio, 2.7; 95% confidence interval, 1.9–3.7), migraine without aura and combined hormonal contraceptive use (odds ratio, 1.8; 95% confidence interval, 1.1–2.9), and migraine without aura without combined hormonal contraceptive use (odds ratio, 2.2; 95% confidence interval, 1.9–2.7).

Conclusion

The joint effect of combined hormonal contraceptives and migraine with aura was associated with a 6-fold increased risk of ischemic stroke compared with neither risk factor. Use of combined hormonal contraceptives did not substantially further increase risk of ischemic stroke among women with migraine without aura. Determining migraine type is critical in assessing safety of combined hormonal contraceptives among women with migraine.

### Safety of hormonal contraceptives among women with migraine: a systematic review [^115jBCtr]. Contraception (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Migraine is common among women of reproductive age and is associated with an increased risk of ischemic stroke. Combined oral contraceptives (COCs) are also associated with an increased risk of ischemic stroke. Use of hormonal contraception among women with migraine might further elevate the risk of stroke among women of reproductive age.

Objective

To identify evidence regarding the risk of arterial thromboembolism (stroke or myocardial infarction) among women with migraine who use hormonal contraceptives.

Methods

We searched the PubMed database for all articles published from database inception through January 2016. We included studies that examined women with migraine overall or separated by subtype (with or without aura). Hormonal contraceptives of interest included combined hormonal methods (COCs, patch and ring) and progestin-only methods (progestin-only pills, injectables, implants and progestin intrauterine devices).

Results

Seven articles met inclusion criteria. All were case-control studies of fair to poor quality reporting on use of COCs or oral contraceptives (OCs) not further described and all reported stroke outcomes. Four studies demonstrated that, among women with migraine (not separated by subtype), COC use was associated with approximately two to four times the risk of stroke compared with nonuse. The only study to examine specific migraine subtypes found an elevated risk of stroke among women with migraine with aura, and this risk was similar regardless of OC use, although these odds ratios were not reported. Two studies did not report risks among women with migraine and COC use combined, but both found increased risks of stroke with migraine and COC use independently. No evidence was found on other hormonal contraceptives or on risk of myocardial infarction.

Conclusion

Limited evidence suggests a two- to fourfold increased risk of stroke among women with migraine who use COCs compared with nonuse. Additional study is needed on the risks of hormonal contraceptives, including combined and progestin-only methods, among women with different migraine subtypes.

### An evidence-based approach to hormonal contraception and headaches [^112DZNVe]. Contraception (2009). Low credibility.

Some controversy exists regarding contraceptive management in women with migraines, particularly migraines with aura. The available scientific literature indicates that combined hormonal contraception is safe with most headache subtypes. However, it should be avoided in women with migraine with aura and women with simple migraines who have other risk factors for stroke. Progestin only contraceptives as well as the copper intrauterine device can be safely used in women with migraines. Accurate classification of a patient's headache type can avoid unnecessary restriction of effective contraceptive methods, particularly those containing estrogen.

Migraine — Primary prevention recommendations: In adults 18 to 64 years of age with migraine with or without aura, evaluation and modification of vascular risk factors are recommended to address the elevated risk of stroke in this patient population (Class of Recommendation [COR] 1; Level of Evidence [LOE] C-LD). In adults with migraine with aura who desire contraception, progestin-only or nonhormonal forms are recommended to avoid the increased risk of ischemic stroke associated with combined hormonal contraception (COR 1; LOE C-LD).

---

### Migraine and cardiovascular disease: systematic review and meta-analysis [^115sdoeG]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Publications over the past years have focused not only on the association of migraine with ischaemic stroke but also on the association of migraine with other vascular events, including haemorrhagic stroke, myocardial infarction, angina, and death due to cardiovascular disease. Our pooled results do not suggest an association between overall migraine and haemorrhagic stroke, myocardial infarction, or death due to cardiovascular disease, whereas the risk of angina seems to be increased by 30%. Individual studies have reported a twofold increased risk of myocardial infarction, angina, and death due to cardiovascular disease for people who have migraine with aura, w3 but not for haemorrhagic stroke. w18

Pooled analyses further indicate that the risk of ischaemic stroke is significantly higher among women than among men. In contrast, the lack of an association between migraine and myocardial infarction did not differ between women and men. This may indicate a differential pathophysiology between migraine and ischaemic stroke and between migraine and myocardial infarction, as well as sex specific effects. Although the associations between migraine and angina and between migraine and death due to cardiovascular disease suggest a higher risk among women than among men, studies were too few to allow a reliable assessment. Certain conditions among women, especially young women, seem to be important determinants in increasing the risk of cardiovascular events, even in the absence of overt atherosclerotic disease. Sex hormones may be such candidates; they have been associated with risk of both migraine and cardiovascular events. In addition, their "magnitude of impact" may be much greater on the cervical-cranial circulation than on the coronary circulation. This needs further investigation.

Implications for clinical practice

The most consistent evidence was the increased risk of ischaemic stroke among people with migraine, which seems to be driven by migraine with aura. In addition, the risk seemed to be further magnified by being younger (< 45 years), being female, smoking, and using oral contraceptives. Thus, in particular, young women who have migraine with aura should be strongly advised to stop smoking, and methods of birth control other than oral contraceptives may be considered. Some evidence shows that among women who have migraine with aura the combination of smoking and use of oral contraceptives leads to the highest risk estimates for ischaemic stroke. w4 Firm evidence on the association of migraine and other ischaemic vascular events is lacking. Therefore patients with migraine should be treated the same as any other patient without migraine: they should be screened for traditional cardiovascular risk factors, such as hypertension, adverse lipid profile, and increased risk of coronary heart disease and, if appropriate, these risk factors should be modified.

MIGRAINE AND STROKE

Migraine and the risk of ischaemic stroke

Numerous studies, including five meta-analyses, have linked migraine, particularly migraine with aura (MA), with increased risk of ischaemic stroke (table 1). The relative risk of ischaemic stroke is doubled in people with MA compared with migraine-free individuals. The risk of ischaemic stroke associated with migraine without aura (MO) is uncertain. The association between migraine and ischaemic stroke is stronger for women, women younger than 45 years, women who use oral contraceptives and women who smoke. Because the prevalence of migraine is three times lower in men than in women, the association is more uncertain for men. The risk is greater for those with active migraine (ie, migraine attack the last 12 months)and higher frequency of attacks; however, there is no conclusive evidence that the severity of migraine attacks influence the risk of ischaemic stroke. Except older people with migraine who are currently smoking, migraine does not seem to be a risk marker for stroke in the older population, unless its onset is later in life. However, longer cumulative exposure to MA, as would be expected with early onset of migraine, is not associated with increased stroke risk in late life. With regard to functional outcome after ischaemic stroke, MA is associated with ischaemic stroke with good functional outcome (ie, modified ranking score from 0 to 1). The classification of migraine and specifically MA in population-based studies is challenging. However, the consistent findings of the association between MA and ischaemic stroke across various study designs and classification schemes make a systematic bias unlikely.

Table 1
Summary of relative risk (95% CI) between migraine and ischaemic stroke in five meta-analyses of observational studies

Clinical implication

MA in women younger than age of 45 years and late onset of MA increase the risk of ischaemic stroke. Active migraine and increased attack frequency increase the risk of ischaemic stroke. The relationship between migraine severity and stroke risk is uncertain.

Headaches and migraine — evidence for levonorgestrel intrauterine device (LNG-IUD) users indicates that no studies directly examined stroke risk among women with migraine, and limited evidence showed no increased risk for ischemic stroke versus women not using hormonal contraception; menstrual migraine is a subtype of migraine without aura.

### 2024 guideline for the primary prevention of stroke: a guideline from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^115Yruv2]. Stroke (2024). High credibility.

Combined hormonal contraception (CHC) — age and risk factor interactions are described, with marked age-related increases and synergistic effects. With CHC, stroke risk increased with age, growing from 3.4 to 64.4 events per 100 000 person-years for individuals 15 to 49 years of age, and risk is higher especially when 35 years of age is used as a cutoff. CHC synergistically increases the risk of hypertension up to 4-fold, smoking up to 3-fold, and migraine with aura up to 6-fold, and higher estrogen doses significantly increased the risk of stroke in those who smoke. Progestin-only contraception in all routes is not associated with an overall increased stroke risk, but in the setting of hypertension progestin-only contraception can increase stroke risk. In RATIO data, higher risk of stroke in women with cardiovascular risk factors than women without was seen in combinations containing 30 μg of estrogen plus second or third-generation progestins, whereas the different generations of progestin stroke risk did not differ in women without stroke risk factors.

### The use of hormonal contraceptives in fertility treatments: a committee opinion [^111VfgkZ]. Fertility and Sterility (2024). High credibility.

Provider considerations before using combined hormonal contraception in fertility patients — providers should be aware of US Medical Eligibility Criteria and RR categories and assess comorbidities including advanced age, smoking, migraine with aura, venous thromboembolic risks, and cardiovascular disease; a migraine history should be elicited before starting combination methods. Women with migraine on combination hormonal contraception had 3 times higher odds of ischemic stroke than those with migraine not using combined methods, with an OR of 3.81 for migraine with aura and an OR of 2.97 for migraine without aura.

### Use of combined oral contraceptives among women with migraine and nonmigrainous headaches: a systematic review [^111Z3xwM]. Contraception (2006). Low credibility.

This systematic review examines evidence evaluating whether women with headaches who use combined oral contraceptives (COCs) have a greater risk of stroke than women with headaches who do not use COCs. We searched MEDLINE for articles published from 1966 through March 2005 relevant to headaches and COC use as risk factors for stroke. Of the 79 articles identified, nine met our selection criteria (eight reports of six observational studies plus one meta-analysis). All studies reported specifically on migraine headaches. Evidence from six case-control studies suggested that COC users with a history of migraine were two to four times as likely to have an ischemic stroke as nonusers with a history of migraine. The odds ratios for ischemic stroke ranged from 6 to almost 14 for COC users with migraine compared with nonusers without migraine. The three studies that provided evidence on hemorrhagic stroke reported low or no risk associated with migraine or with COC use.

### 2024 guideline for the primary prevention of stroke: a guideline from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^112joXwK]. Stroke (2024). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for acute ischemic stroke, more specifically with respect to female patients, patients with migraine, AHA/ASA 2024 guidelines recommend to offer progestin-only or nonhormonal contraception in patients with migraine with aura desiring contraception to avoid the increased risk of ischemic stroke associated with combined hormonal contraception.

### Headache and female hormones: what you need to know [^114onSBo]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2001). Low credibility.

The normal female lifecycle is associated with hormonal milestones, including menarche, pregnancy, contraceptive use, menopause, and the use of replacement sex hormones. Attacks of migraine without aura, but not with aura, are more likely to occur 2 days before onset and on the first 2 days of menses, but they are not more severe than those that occur outside the perimenstrual period. Oral sumatriptan and naratriptan are effective as short-term perimenstrual prophylaxis. Postdural headache can occur during the postpartum period. The International Headache Society Task Force assessed the efficacy of treatment of women who had migraine with combined oral contraceptives and hormone replacement therapy, as well as the risk of ischemic stroke associated with their use. There is no contraindication to the use of oral contraceptives in women with migraine in the absence of migraine aura or other risk factors. There is a potentially increased risk of ischemic stroke in women with migraine who are using combined oral contraceptives and have additional risk factors that cannot easily be controlled, including migraine with aura. There is no compelling evidence that postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy either decreases or increases stroke risk.

Data Sources

Observational studies published between 1966 and June 2004 (identified through Medline and Embase) that examined the association between migraine and risk of ischaemic stroke.

Results

14 studies (11 case-control studies and 3 cohort studies) were identified. These studies suggest that the risk of stroke is increased in people with migraine (relative risk 2.16, 95% confidence interval 1.89 to 2.48). This increase in risk was consistent in people who had migraine with aura (relative risk 2.27, 1.61 to 3.19) and migraine without aura (relative risk 1.83, 1.06 to 3.15), as well as in those taking oral contraceptives (relative risk 8.72, 5.05 to 15.05).

Conclusions

Data from observational studies suggest that migraine may be a risk factor in developing stroke. More studies are needed to explore the mechanism of this potential association. In addition, the risk of migraine among users of oral contraceptives must be further investigated.

MIGRAINE AND CARDIOVASCULAR RISK

Migraine and Cardiovascular Disease: Systemic Review and Meta-Analysis

What was known?.

Migraines affect up to 13% of the population and are significantly more common in women. Up to a third of migraine patients experience aura. A 2004 meta-analysis showed a significant association between ischemic stroke and both migraine with and without aura.

What this study adds.

This updated meta-analysis incorporates data from six new studies, including three large cohort studies (which increased the sample size from roughly 7800 patients to over 210,000 patients). Only well-designed case-control or cohort studies were included. The investigators found that migraine with aura was associated with a two-fold increase in risk for ischemic stroke (RR = 2.16, 95%CI, 1.53–3.03). The risk was higher for women than men (RR = 2.08, 95%CI, 1.13–3.84), those < 45 years (RR = 2.65, 95%CI, 1.41–4.97), smokers (RR = 9.03, 95%CI, 4.22–19.34), and oral contraceptive users (RR = 7.02, 95%CI, 1.51–32.68). Patients with migraine without aura showed no increased risk. There was no association between migraine and myocardial infarction or cardiovascular death.

How should I change my practice?.

Aggressive modification of cardiovascular risk factors and alternatives to estrogen-containing contraceptives should be considered for women with migraine with aura.

Hormonal contraception — recommendations: For individuals considering combined hormonal contraception (CHC), lower doses of ethinyl estradiol are recommended (Class 1, Level B-NR) to minimize potential increased stroke risk. In individuals with specific stroke risk factors (age ≥ 35 years, tobacco use, hypertension, or migraine with aura) who are considering contraception, shared decision-making is recommended (Class 1, Level C-EO) to determine the best contraceptive choice to balance the risk of stroke from contraception and the risk of stroke with pregnancy. In individuals with these stroke risk factors considering contraception, progestin-only contraception or nonhormonal contraception is reasonable (Class 2a, Level C-LD) to reduce the increased stroke risk associated with estrogen-containing contraception.

Migraine and the combined contraceptive pill?

Women with migraine and active aura have a twofold increased risk of ischaemic stroke. In women aged less than 45 years, smoking and the combined contraceptive pill further increase the stroke risk.NICE recommends avoiding combined hormonal contraceptives in women who have migraine with aura due to the increased risk of stroke. In these patients, we recommend the progesterone-only pill, contraceptive implant, depot or levonorgesterol intrauterine device.

Treating headache in the emergency department

When managing acute, severe headache in the emergency department, our first concern is to identify red flags (see table 4). An accurate headache history is essential and if a true thunderclap or sinister headache is identified this will need investigating.

Table 4
Secondary headaches presenting to the emergency department

When there is a positive diagnosis of severe migraine, its effective management can ensure high-quality patient care and also facilitates a timely discharge. We offer sumatriptan 6 mg, typically with an antiemetic such as metoclopramide or prochlorperazine. A recent systematic review advised against using morphine, tramadol, intramuscular diclofenac, haloperidol or dexamethasone. A period of intravenous rehydration may also help. It is also essential to make a future management plan to help prevent readmissions, which often are multiple in severe migraineurs. Clinicians can review the need for migraine prophylaxis and abortive therapy as an outpatient. A GON block can help patients in crisis before discharge.

### Estrogens, migraine, and stroke [^117C3vcA]. Stroke (2004). Low credibility.

Epidemiological studies suggest the existence of close but complex relationships between estrogens, migraine, and stroke in women before menopause. Migraine, particularly without aura, is strongly influenced by estrogens as illustrated by the frequency of onset at puberty, of menstrual migraine, and of improvement during pregnancy. Migraine, particularly with aura, is a risk factor for ischemic stroke with a relative risk of 3, further increased by tobacco smoking and oral contraceptive use. The pathophysiological mechanism underlying these close relationships remains unknown. In practice, given the very low absolute risk of stroke in young women, there is no systematic contraindication to oral contraceptive use in young female migraineurs but rather a firm recommendation for no smoking and for the use of low-estrogen-content pills or progestogens only, particularly in migraine with aura.

### Duration, frequency, recency, and type of migraine and the risk of ischaemic stroke in women of childbearing age [^111vaAki]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Migraine is recognised increasingly as a risk factor for ischaemic stroke in women of childbearing age. Migraine with aura poses a higher risk than migraine without aura.

Objective

To investigate further the effect of duration, frequency, recency, and type of migraine on the risk of ischaemic stroke.

Methods

Additional analyses of a previously reported multicentre case-control study of the relation between stroke and migraine in women aged 20–44 years.

Results

Among 86 cases of ischaemic stroke and 214 controls, the adjusted risk of ischaemic stroke was significantly associated with: (1) migraine of more than 12 years duration, odds ratio (OR) 4.61 (1.27–16.8); (2) initial migraine with aura, OR 8.37 (2.33–30.1); (3) particularly if attacks were more frequent than 12 times per year, OR 10.4 (2.18–49.4). In no case did correction for oral contraception usage significantly alter these odds ratios. Increasing risk of ischaemic stroke was related to a change to increased frequency of headaches (trend p ≤ 0.03).

Conclusions

These data support earlier reports of a relation between ischaemic stroke and migraine with aura. The risk seems particularly high in those whose initial migraine type involved aura occurring more than 12 times per year.

### Migraine headache: an under-appreciated risk factor for cardiovascular disease in women [^111XPWFS]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Also, a knowledge gap exists about whether controlling migraine symptoms and use of long‐term combination cardiovascular preventive therapy (eg, beta‐blockers, statins, aspirin, etc) might reduce the risk of cardiovascular events, particularly stroke. Triptans are commonly used to abort moderate to severe attacks of migraine. Although triptans exert vasoconstrictive effects, studies indicate that triptan use does not increase cardiovascular risk in patients with migraine. 59 Use of NSAIDs should be limited to acute migraine attacks, to mitigate long‐term risks of cardiovascular events associated with chronic NSAID therapy. Moreover, both agents (ie, NSAIDs and triptans) should be avoided in pregnant women and those with cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension and focus on prevention of attacks and using other analgesic agents should be entertained.

Patients with migraine should be counseled about a healthy lifestyle such as regular physical activity, smoking cessation, and modification of other traditional CVD risks (eg, blood pressure control and weight loss). For example, a study of elderly patients with migraine found significant interaction between migraine and smoking for the risk of stroke and combined vascular events, such that migraine was associated with an increased risk of stroke and vascular events among active smokers but not among non‐smokers. 44 These findings highlight the importance of smoking cessation. As population‐based studies have demonstrated that patients with migraine are more likely to smoke, have high blood pressure, unfavorable cholesterol profile, and report a parental history of premature myocardial infarction, 60 it is important to identify those patients who might benefit from traditional risk factor modification. A recent European position document has suggested that hormonal contraceptive use, particularly combined therapy, might further increase ischemic stroke risk in those with migraine, especially those with aura. 61 This recommendation is consistent with American Heart Association guidelines for stroke in women, which cautions against use of hormonal contraceptives, but notes that the evidence is not conclusive. 62

Data extraction

Two investigators (MS, PMR) independently extracted data and entered them in a customised database. Disagreements were resolved by consensus. The extracted data included authors and title of study, year of publication, study design, study size, age range and sex of the participants, smoking status, use of oral contraceptives, migraine status (any migraine, migraine with aura, migraine without aura), investigated outcome (for example, total stroke, ischaemic stroke, myocardial infarction, angina), and relative risks with 95% confidence intervals for each of the associations investigated. All data were extracted from the published studies and we did not contact the authors for further information.

Statistical analysis

For our analyses we grouped the studies according to the number available. We used the outcome categories as presented in the original articles (box). For the category of any migraine and ischaemic stroke, we included only studies that looked at any migraine (we did not pool results from migraine with and without aura) and that used strict criteria for ischaemic stroke (studies showing only combined results for ischaemic stroke and transient ischaemic attacks were excluded). We included studies irrespective of sex and age distribution. In addition to the overall analysis, we carried out stratified analyses according to study type (case-control v cohort), sex, age (< 45 years v ≥ 45 years), use of oral contraceptives (current v none), and smoking status (current v not current). For the category of migraine with aura and ischaemic stroke we also looked at the subgroups of smokers, women currently using oral contraceptives, and women currently using oral contraceptives and smoking. For the analyses including any migraine and either myocardial infarction, angina, or death due to cardiovascular disease we looked at results for overall migraine among all studies as well as analyses stratified by sex, and results for migraine with and without aura separately.

Contraceptive and hormone replacement therapy

It is common for stroke to occur in women taking either hormonal based contraceptive therapy or hormone replacement therapy (HRT). There is no evidence from randomised trials that HRT reduces the risk of ischaemic or haemorrhagic stroke. This was reviewed in the recent European Stroke Organisation guidelines on stroke in women. On meta-analysis of data from 6 trials and approximately 45,000 participants, there was no difference in rate of ischaemic stroke (OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.41). On meta-analysis of data from 5 trials and approximately 35,000 participants, there was no difference in the rate of haemorrhagic stroke (OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.15). The use of oestrogen containing combined oral contraceptive treatment has been associated with an increased risk of both myocardial infarction and stroke. In a meta-analysis of 14 studies, the risk of stroke was increased more than two-fold. The risk of stroke with oral contraceptives is higher in people with other cardiovascular risk factors including smoking, increasing age, and in particular with migraine with aura. For example, in this study, the risk of stroke was increased 7-fold in women with migraine with aura taking the contraceptive pill, although there was considerable uncertainty in this estimate. The increased risk is dose related with a reported increase in odds of stroke of 1.2 every 10-μg increment in oestrogen dose. There is less certainty regarding progestogen only contraceptives and they may not increase risk, but data are limited. However, they are the more appropriate choice should oral contraception be required in a high-risk person.

### Migraine and vascular diseases: a review of the evidence and potential implications for management [^115VfWFD]. Cephalalgia (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

The higher-than-expected incidence of vascular diseases reported in migraineurs suggests that migraine may, in some cases, be a dangerous condition rather than just a distressing but harmless disorder. We provide a systematic review of data linking migraine to vascular diseases.

Migraine and Vascular Diseases

Available data indicate an increased risk of ischemic stroke in subjects suffering from migraine with aura. In addition, evidence suggests an association between migraine with aura and cardiac disease, intracerebral hemorrhage, retinal vasculopathy and mortality that needs to be further corroborated; consequently, for those conditions, migraine with aura can be only considered among the less-well-documented risk factors. As the absolute risk of ischemic stroke in the overall migraineur population is low, subjects suffering from migraine with aura should be made aware of the possible link but not unduly alarmed. It is a common notion that the vascular risk of migraineurs may be further increased by the presence of easily treatable vascular risk factors such as arterial hypertension, cigarette smoking and oral contraceptive use.

Conclusions

Forthcoming guidelines should appropriately recommend supporting migraineurs not only with measures aimed at decreasing headache frequency, thus improving quality of life, but also with general measures and preventive strategies aimed to reduce the overall vascular risk. In fact, headache specialists should take care not only of relieving pain but also of assessing and treating concurrent vascular risk factors, while gynecologists, in particular, should routinely consider the presence and type of migraine before prescribing oral contraceptives.

### Migraine and risk of haemorrhagic stroke in women: prospective cohort study [^1146dmZS]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Comparison with other studies

Our data contrast with a previous report from the Women's Health Study in which migraine with aura was not associated with increased risk of haemorrhagic stroke after a mean of nine years of follow-up. The pattern of association suggests that this discrepancy is caused by the difference in length of follow-up. The increased risk for haemorrhagic stroke among women with migraine with aura becomes apparent only after longer follow-up (mean of 13.6 years in the present study), similar to a pattern observed for ischaemic vascular events.

While several studiesand two meta-analyseshave evaluated the association of migraine, and specifically migraine with aura, with ischaemic stroke, data on the association between migraine and haemorrhagic stroke are sparse. One case-control study found an increased risk of haemorrhagic stroke for people with a family history of migraine (odds ratio 2.30, 95% confidence interval 1.35 to 3.90), but in those with active migraine the increased risk was more apparent for people with migraine without aura (1.84, 0.77 to 4.39). Another study of 430 women aged 15–44 with stroke used two control groups (their matched neighbours and hospital controls) to evaluate the association between migraine and haemorrhagic stroke. Compared with the neighbour control group, women with migraine who did not use oral contraceptives had an increased risk of haemorrhagic stroke (1.8, 1.2 to 2.7). The increased risk was not apparent when the hospital control group was used as reference, which might relate to biases when using hospital based control populations. Women with migraine who additionally used oral contraceptives had a significantly increased risk of haemorrhagic stroke regardless of the control group used for comparison. Information on migraine aura was not available in this study. In a large population based sample of inpatients, ICD-9 coding for migraine in the perinatal period was associated with various vascular events, including intracerebral haemorrhage (9.1, 3.0 to 27.8).

### Migraine and menopause-a narrative review [^115dER7k]. Menopause (2020). Medium credibility.

Importance and Objectives

This narrative review addresses common clinical questions and concerns of both physicians and patients about migraine during and after the perimenopausal transition, specifically (1) How does the perimenopausal transition affect migraine prevalence and does this vary by migraine type? (2) Does the magnitude of stroke risk associated with migraine increase with hormone therapy (HT)?, and (3) What are best practices as regards migraine treatment in perimenopausal women?

Methods

We searched PubMed from 2010 through the present. Search terms included migraine, menopause, and HT. Articles were included if they were in English and had full text availability. In addition, key references identified in the search articles were included.

Discussion and Conclusion

Many women are informed that their migraines will disappear postmenopause; there are some data to support this, but a specific time frame has not been evidenced. Stroke risk in women with migraine with aura is small in absolute terms, but important at the population level, because migraine is so prevalent. The risk becomes clinically important in the context of additional stroke risk factors, which increase with aging such as hypertension. Estrogen in combined hormonal contraception increases the risk of an ischemic stroke, however, the lower amount of estrogen in HT may not contribute to a meaningful increase in stroke risk. HT is a preventative sex-specific treatment for female migraineurs for the menopausal transition. Sex differences for other conventional treatments outside their use in menstrual and menstrually related migraine have not been studied specifically in the menopausal transition.

### Probable migraine with visual aura and risk of ischemic stroke: the stroke prevention in young women study [^112VUCJp]. Stroke (2007). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Migraine with aura is associated with ischemic stroke, but few studies have investigated the clinical and anatomic features of this association. We assessed the association of probable migraine with and without visual aura with ischemic stroke within subgroups defined by stroke subtype, vascular territory, probable migraine characteristics, and other clinical features.

Methods

Using data from a population-based, case-control study, we studied 386 women ages 15 to 49 years with first ischemic stroke and 614 age- and ethnicity-matched controls. Based on their responses to a questionnaire on headache symptoms, subjects were classified as having no migraine, probable migraine without visual aura, or probable migraine with visual aura (PMVA).

Results

Women with PMVA had 1.5 greater odds of ischemic stroke (95% CI, 1.1 to 2.0); the risk was highest in those with no history of hypertension, diabetes, or myocardial infarction compared to women with no migraine. Women with PMVA who were current cigarette smokers and current users of oral contraceptives had 7.0-fold higher odds of stroke (95% CI, 1.3 to 22.8) than did women with PMVA who were nonsmokers and non-oral contraceptive users. Women with onset of PMVA within the previous year had 6.9-fold higher adjusted odds of stroke (95% CI, 2.3 to 21.2) compared to women with no history of migraine.

Conclusions

PMVA was associated with an increased risk of stroke, particularly among women without other medical conditions associated with stroke. Behavioral risk factors, specifically smoking and oral contraceptive use, markedly increased the risk of PMVA, as did recent onset of PMVA.

### Migraine and risk of stroke [^11787rNz]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

Migraine and stroke are two common and heterogeneous neurovascular disorders responsible for a significant burden for those affected and a great economic cost for the society. There is growing evidence that migraine increases the overall risk of cerebrovascular diseases. In this review, based on available literature through a PubMed search, we found that ischaemic stroke in people with migraine is strongly associated with migraine with aura, young age, female sex, use of oral contraceptives and smoking habits. The risk of transient ischaemic attack also seems to be increased in people with migraine, although this issue has not been extensively investigated. Although migraine appears to be associated with haemorrhagic stroke, the migraine aura status has a small influence on this relationship. Neuroimaging studies have revealed a higher prevalence of asymptomatic structural brain lesions in people with migraine. They are also more likely to have unfavourable vascular risk factors; however, the increased risk of stroke seems to be more apparent among people with migraine without traditional risk factors. The mechanism behind the migraine-stroke association is unknown. In light of the higher risk of stroke in people with migraine with aura, it is important to identify and modify any vascular risk factor. There is currently no direct evidence to support that a migraine prophylactic treatment can reduce future stroke in people with migraine.

### Migraine, headache, and the risk of stroke in women: a prospective study [^111zrpp7]. Neurology (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Migraine and headache in general have been associated with subsequent risk of stroke, primarily in retrospective case-control studies. Prospective data evaluating the association between specific headache forms and stroke are sparse.

Methods

A prospective cohort study was conducted among 39,754 US health professionals age 45 and older participating in the Women's Health Study with an average follow-up of 9 years. Incident stroke was self-reported and confirmed by medical record review.

Results

A total of 385 strokes (309 ischemic, 72 hemorrhagic, and 4 undefined) occurred. Compared with nonmigraineurs, participants who reported migraine overall or migraine without aura had no increased risk of any stroke type. Participants who reported migraine with aura had increased adjusted hazards ratios (HRs) of 1.53 (95% CI 1.02 to 2.31) for total stroke and 1.71 (95% CI 1.11 to 2.66) for ischemic stroke but no increased risk for hemorrhagic stroke. Participants with migraine with aura who were < 55 years old had a greater increase in risk of total (HR 1.75; 95% CI 1.02 to 3.00) and ischemic (HR 2.25; 95% CI 1.30 to 3.91) stroke. Compared with participants without headache, headache in general and nonmigraine headache were not associated with total, ischemic, or hemorrhagic stroke.

Conclusions

In these prospective data, migraine was not associated with total, ischemic, or hemorrhagic stroke. In subgroup analyses, we found increased risks of total and ischemic stroke for migraineurs with aura. The absolute risk increase was, however, low, with 3.8 additional cases per year per 10,000 women.

### 2021 guideline for the prevention of stroke in patients with stroke and transient ischemic attack: a guideline from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^113FjpDX]. Stroke (2021). High credibility.

Migraine — secondary stroke prevention considerations: Migraine has been associated with ischemic stroke and white matter hyperintensities in numerous studies, and in patients with migraine who have had an ischemic stroke, data on the risk of recurrent stroke are limited and conflicting. On the basis of these limited data, practitioners may consider implementing preventive treatments to reduce migraine frequency in patients with migraine and prior ischemic stroke, and avoiding oral contraceptive agents with exogenous estrogen in women with migraine with aura and prior ischemic stroke may perhaps be appropriate. Observational studies provide conflicting evidence about the association between triptan therapy and stroke risk and excluded patients with prior ischemic stroke; there are theoretical risks with calcitonin gene–related peptide receptor antagonists but clinical evidence is lacking, therefore no recommendations can be made for the use of triptans and calcitonin gene–related peptide receptor antagonists in patients with migraine and prior ischemic stroke.

### Stroke prevention in women: synopsis of the 2014 American Heart Association / American stroke association guideline [^113CKrAN]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Description

In February 2014, the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association released their first guideline focused on stroke prevention in women. This new guideline highlights unique risk factors for stroke in women, including oral contraception and hormone therapy, and pregnancy-associated disorders, such as preeclampsia, that may have long-lasting consequences on a woman's health. It also addresses hypertension; atrial fibrillation; migraine headache with aura; and the epidemiology of types of stroke, such as aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage and cerebral vein thrombosis, that are predominant in women.

Methods

Members of a multidisciplinary expert panel searched, reviewed, and critiqued relevant English-language literature published between 1990 and May 2013. The panel devised evidence tables and developed recommendations using American Heart Association guideline procedures and levels of evidence.

Recommendations

This synopsis of the guideline summarizes the evidence about risk factors for stroke in women and suggests prevention strategies. It also describes the new recommendations relevant to identifying and treating hypertensive disorders in pregnancy that increase risk for stroke.

### CDC grand rounds: public health strategies to prevent and treat strokes [^111Uc1P1]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2017). Low credibility.

Although men have a higher age-adjusted incidence for stroke, women live longer and thus have a higher lifetime risk of stroke than men. Approximately twice as many women die from stroke than from breast cancer each year. Approximately 60% of persons who die from stroke are women, and women tend to have worse functional outcomes in terms of returning to baseline activities of daily living and quality of life after experiencing a stroke. Some risk factors that are unique to women include pregnancy, gestational diabetes, eclampsia and preeclampsia, changes in hormonal status, and postmenopausal hormone use. Several studies have shown that having preeclampsia or gestational hypertension increases a woman's risk for stroke approximately twofold, and women who experience preeclampsia have a fourfold increased risk for developing future hypertension. Among women who use oral contraceptives, obesity and hypercholesterolemia increase the risk for stroke 4.6 and 10.8 times, respectively, compared with women without the risk factor and not using oral contraceptives. Risk factors for stroke that are more potent or more prevalent among women include migraines with aura, atrial fibrillation, diabetes, depression, and psychosocial stress. Young women who experience migraines with aura have a twofold increase in the risk for stroke compared with women without migraines; for women with migraines with aura who also smoke and use oral contraceptives, the risk for stroke increases approximately seven times compared with women who do not smoke or use oral contraceptives. Depression and psychosocial stress increase the risk for stroke approximately 30% in both men and women.

Migraine and the risk of haemorrhagic stroke

Several studies have evaluated the possible link between migraine and haemorrhagic stroke, and although some studies fail to find any association, there is increasing evidence suggesting that there is an association, particularly in women younger than 45 years. Although some studies found increased risk in people with MA, there is overall not sufficient evidence that the risk of haemorrhagic stroke is particularly increased for MA. The association between the use of oral contraceptives and haemorrhagic stroke in women with migraine is more uncertain. Due to very low number of outcome events, it is challenging to study the association between migraine and the different subtypes of haemorrhagic strokes (ie, intracerebral haemorrhage and subarachnoid haemorrhage). In contrast to ischaemic stroke, which is associated with strokes that result in low grade of functional impairment, haemorrhagic stroke suggests a stronger link with fatal events.

Clinical implication

While women under the age of 45 years may be at increased risk of haemorrhagic stroke, the overall relationship between migraine and haemorrhagic stroke and the specific relationship between migraine subtypes and haemorrhagic stroke are uncertain.

MIGRAINE AND RISK OF CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE

There is growing evidence of an association between migraine and other cardiovascular disorders including myocardial infarction, hypertension, venous thromboembolism and atrial fibrillation (AF), with stronger association in people with MA. An association between migraine and cardiovascular disease mortality has also been found. While the annual cardiovascular mortality risk for migraine is relatively low, the risk may accumulate when magnified across decades of individual migraine exposure. The QRISK3 algorithm was recently developed and validated to predict 10-year risk of cardiovascular disease in men and women aged 25–84 years. Migraine being included in this algorithm indicates its importance in the risk prediction of cardiovascular disease. Although evidence for a link between migraine and cardiovascular disease exist, it is still unclear whether migraine itself increases the risk or is a marker of another underlying cause. Improvement of aura with aspirinand migraine with warfarinhas been observed in observational case studies; however, further research is necessary to confirm these effects. There is no evidence that controlling migraine attacks with preventive drugs can reduce cardiovascular risk.

Clinical implication

Current migraine guidelines do not recommend use of antithrombotic drugs in the prophylaxis of migraine, but clinicians should consider whether patients at particularly high risk of cardiovascular disease would benefit from such treatment.

Objective: To identify evidence regarding the risk of arterial thromboembolism among women with migraine who use hormonal contraceptives. Methods: We searched the PubMed database for all articles published from database inception through January 2016.

We included studies that examined women with migraine overall or separated by subtype. Hormonal contraceptives of interest included combined hormonal methods and progestin-only methods. Results: Seven articles met inclusion criteria. All were case–control studies of fair to poor quality reporting on use of COCs or oral contraceptives not further described and all reported stroke outcomes. Four studies demonstrated that, among women with migraine, COC use was associated with approximately two to four times the risk of stroke compared with nonuse. The only study to examine specific migraine subtypes found an elevated risk of stroke among women with migraine with aura, and this risk was similar regardless of OC use, although these odds ratios were not reported.

Two studies did not report risks among women with migraine and COC use combined, but both found increased risks of stroke with migraine and COC use independently. No evidence was found on other hormonal contraceptives or on risk of myocardial infarction. Conclusion: Limited evidence suggests a two- to fourfold increased risk of stroke among women with migraine who use COCs compared with nonuse. Additional study is needed on the risks of hormonal contraceptives, including combined and progestin-only methods, among women with different migraine subtypes. Subjects: Keywords:

c. Cerebrovascular Diseases

Oral contraceptives have been shown to increase both the relative and attributable risks of cerebrovascular events (thrombotic and hemorrhagic strokes), although, in general, the risk is greatest among older (> 35 years), hypertensive women who also smoke. Hypertension was found to be a risk factor for both users and nonusers, for both types of strokes, while smoking interacted to increase the risk for hemorrhagic strokes. Transient ischemic attacks have also been associated with oral contraceptive use.

In a large study, the relative risk of thrombotic strokes has been shown to range from 3 for normotensive users to 14 for users with severe hypertension. The relative risk of hemorrhagic stroke is reported to be 1.2 for nonsmokers who used oral contraceptives, 2.6 for smokers who did not use oral contraceptives, 7.6 for smokers who used oral contraceptives, 1.8 for normotensive users and 25.7 for users with severe hypertension. The attributable risk is also greater in older women. Oral contraceptives also increase the risk for stroke in women with other underlying risk factors such as certain inherited or acquired thrombophilias. Women with migraine (particularly migraine/headaches with focal neurological symptoms such as aura) who take combination oral contraceptives may be at an increased risk of stroke. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS).

d. Dose-Related Risk of Vascular Disease from Oral Contraceptives

A positive association has been observed between the amount of estrogen and progestogen in oral contraceptives and the risk of vascular disease. A decline in serum high-density lipoproteins (HDL) has been reported with many progestational agents. A decline in serum high-density lipoproteins has been associated with an increased incidence of ischemic heart disease. Because estrogens increase HDL cholesterol, the net effect of an oral contraceptive depends on a balance achieved between doses of estrogen and progestogen and the nature and absolute amount of progestogen used in the contraceptive. The amount of both hormones should be considered in the choice of an oral contraceptive.

Minimizing exposure to estrogen and progestogen is in keeping with good principles of therapeutics. For any particular estrogen/progestogen combination, the dosage regimen prescribed should be one which contains the least amount of estrogen and progestogen that is compatible with a low failure rate and the needs of the individual patient. New acceptors of oral contraceptive agents should be started on preparations containing the lowest estrogen content which is judged appropriate for the individual patient.

### Migraine and risk of cardiovascular disease in women: prospective cohort study [^112snVfU]. BMJ (2016). Excellent credibility.

In a matched cohort study of 11 541 patients with migraine who were aged 18 to 45 years and an equal number of controls from the Taiwan National Health Insurance database, Wang and colleagues reported an increased risk of ischemic heart disease for people with migraine (hazard ratio 2.50, 1.78 to 3.52). The Reykjavik Study, which included 18 725 men and women, showed very similar results for the association between overall migraine and cardiovascular disease mortality. After adjustment for potential confounders, participants with any indication of migraine had a 16% increased risk of dying from any cause (hazard ratio 1.16, 1.04 to 1.29). This risk was stronger for people with migraine with aura (hazard ratio 1.21, 1.12 to 1.30) and was higher for mortality from cardiovascular disease (1.27, 1.13 to 1.43) compared with people without headache. Results from the American Migraine Prevalence and Prevention study also indicate an increased risk of cardiovascular disease events. In this population based case-control study of 6102 patients with migraine and 5243 controls, migraine overall was associated with a relative risk for myocardial infarction of 2.16 (1.70 to 2.76) and for total stroke of 1.54 (1.16 to 2.05).

Two studies have found an association between migraine with aura and angina but not myocardial infarction. The lack of association with myocardial infarction may be related to shorter follow-up time. In our data, women with migraine had an increased risk for myocardial infarction, as well as for angina and coronary revascularization procedures.

Many studies have focused on the evaluation of potential modifying factors and on the identification of a subgroup of patients with migraine who are at high risk for developing a subsequent stroke. Studies have consistently found that the association between migraine and stroke was observable only among younger people and was stronger among women. Among women, several studies have focused on the role of smoking and oral contraceptive use. In particular, the combination of smoking and oral contraceptive use among young women with migraine with aura markedly increased the risk of ischemic stroke, reaching a 10-fold increase for current cigarette smokers and oral contraceptives users. However, for overall vascular risk status, several studies indicate that the association between migraine and ischemic stroke is apparent only among those with a low cardiovascular risk profile.

### Migraine and cardiovascular disease: systematic review and meta-analysis [^117UgVhj]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Our results must be interpreted in view of the characteristics of the individual studies and the diseases investigated. Based on the vascular phenomena described in migraine, the association between migraine and cardiovascular disease has been the focus of attention for decades. While on the basis of current evidence the consensus seems to be that neural mechanisms are the main cause of migraine and that vascular findings only constitute epiphenomena, reports linking migraine with cardiovascular disease have accumulated. Most studies have investigated the association of migraine with ischaemic stroke and support a link between the two conditions, which is substantiated by a meta-analysis of data published until 2004. This previous meta-analysis reported a twofold increased risk of ischaemic stroke among people with migraine, which was similar between migraine with and migraine without aura, somewhat higher among people with migraine aged less than 45 years, and clearly increased among women using oral contraceptives. Our overall results agree in part with this meta-analysis, showing a 73% increased risk of ischaemic stroke for people with migraine, which was increased for smokers, women using oral contraceptives, and younger people. In contrast with the previous meta-analysis, however, our results suggest that an increased risk of ischaemic stroke is only apparent among people who have migraine with but not without aura. Several reasons may account for the discrepant finding. Firstly, three large population based studies have been published since the first meta-analysis. w1-w3 Secondly, the previous meta-analysisincluded competing studies utilising data from the same underlying study cohort. w13 w14 Thirdly, the previous meta-analysis considered studies investigating both "ischaemic stroke" and "ischaemic stroke plus transient ischaemic attacks" as a combined end point. w10 w20 w22 However, migraine aura, epileptic conditions, and presyncopal conditions may be misdiagnosed as transient ischaemic attacks, falsely increasing the effect estimate. This notion is also supported by our data, showing a higher risk for transient ischaemic attacks (pooled relative risk 2.34, 95% confidence interval 1.90 to 2.88) than for ischaemic stroke (1.73, 1.31 to 2.29). We excluded studies that only reported results for a combined outcome of ischaemic stroke and transient ischaemic attacks.

### Migraine and cardiovascular disease: systematic review and meta-analysis [^112HU1sw]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the association between migraine and cardiovascular disease, including stroke, myocardial infarction, and death due to cardiovascular disease.

Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis.

Data Sources

Electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library) and reference lists of included studies and reviews published until January 2009. Selection criteria Case-control and cohort studies investigating the association between any migraine or specific migraine subtypes and cardiovascular disease. Review methods Two investigators independently assessed eligibility of identified studies in a two step approach. Disagreements were resolved by consensus. Studies were grouped according to a priori categories on migraine and cardiovascular disease.

Data Extraction

Two investigators extracted data. Pooled relative risks and 95% confidence intervals were calculated.

Results

Studies were heterogeneous for participant characteristics and definition of cardiovascular disease. Nine studies investigated the association between any migraine and ischaemic stroke (pooled relative risk 1.73, 95% confidence interval 1.31 to 2.29). Additional analyses indicated a significantly higher risk among people who had migraine with aura (2.16, 1.53 to 3.03) compared with people who had migraine without aura (1.23, 0.90 to 1.69; meta-regression for aura status P = 0.02). Furthermore, results suggested a greater risk among women (2.08, 1.13 to 3.84) compared with men (1.37, 0.89 to 2.11). Age less than 45 years, smoking, and oral contraceptive use further increased the risk. Eight studies investigated the association between migraine and myocardial infarction (1.12, 0.95 to 1.32) and five between migraine and death due to cardiovascular disease (1.03, 0.79 to 1.34). Only one study investigated the association between women who had migraine with aura and myocardial infarction and death due to cardiovascular disease, showing a twofold increased risk.

Conclusion

Migraine is associated with a twofold increased risk of ischaemic stroke, which is only apparent among people who have migraine with aura. Our results also suggest a higher risk among women and risk was further magnified for people with migraine who were aged less than 45, smokers, and women who used oral contraceptives. We did not find an overall association between any migraine and myocardial infarction or death due to cardiovascular disease. Too few studies are available to reliably evaluate the impact of modifying factors, such as migraine aura, on these associations.

5.3 Migraine

FEMLYV is contraindicated in females who have migraines with aura [see Contraindications (4)]. Discontinue FEMLYV in females using FEMLYV who develop new migraines that are recurrent, persistent, or severe. Discontinue FEMLYV if there is an increased frequency or severity of migraines during CHC use (which may be prodromal of a cerebrovascular event).

Migraines with aura increase the risk for stroke. This stroke risk is further increased in females who have migraines with aura with use of CHCs.

5.4 Malignant Neoplasms

Breast Cancer

FEMLYV is contraindicated in females who currently have or have had breast cancer because breast cancer may be hormonally sensitive [see Contraindications (4)].

Epidemiology studies have not found a consistent association between use of combined oral contraceptives (COCs) and breast cancer risk. Studies do not show an association between ever (current or past) use of COCs and risk of breast cancer. However, some studies report a small increase in the risk of breast cancer among current or recent users (< 6 months since last use) and current users with longer duration of COC use [see Postmarketing Experience (6.2)].

Cervical Cancer

A causal relationship between the use of CHCs and the development of cervical cancer and intraepithelial neoplasia has not been clearly established. In observational studies, the use of oral hormonal contraceptives in females for five years or more, compared to females who did not use oral hormonal contraceptives, was associated with an increased risk of cervical cancer and intraepithelial neoplasia. In these studies, the use of oral hormonal contraceptives in females for 10 years or more, compared to females who received oral hormonal contraceptives for 5–9 years, was associated with an increased risk of cervical cancer and intraepithelial neoplasia. Limitations in these epidemiologic studies include potential recall bias, differences in sexual behavior, and other factors such as establishing whether there were data on persistent high-risk Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) infection.

### Effects of an estrogen-free, desogestrel-containing oral contraceptive in women with migraine with aura: a prospective diary-based pilot study [^115yhZur]. Contraception (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Migraine with aura (MA) is a contraindication to the use of combined oral contraceptives (COCs) because of the increased risk of ischemic stroke. Progestogen-only contraceptive pill (POP) is a safe alternative to COCs and it is preferable in women with cerebrovascular diseases or risk factors for stroke.

Study Design

Prospective diary-based pilot study. Thirty women with MA (n = 15 who have never used COCs and n = 15 who had previously used COCs were diagnosed according to the International Headache Society criteria. The observational period lasted 9 months during which women filled in a diary with the clinical characteristics of headache attacks. After a 3-month run-in period, each subject received an estrogen-free desogestrel (DSG) (75 mcg/day)-containing OC (Cerazette(®); Schering-Plough, formerly NV Organon, Oss, The Netherlands). Follow-up evaluations were planned at the end of the third and sixth month of treatment.

Results

The number (mean ± S.D.) of migraine attacks was significantly reduced both in previous COCs users (from 3.9 ± 1.0 to 2.9 ± 0.8; p < .001) and nonusers (from 3.2 ± 0.9 to 2.6 ± 1.3; p < .02) following 6 months of POP use in comparison with the run-in period. Duration of headache pain did not differ significantly in both groups throughout the study. Interestingly enough, a beneficial POP effect on the duration (mean ± S.D.) of visual aura (from 16.3 ± 9.5 to 11.4 ± 5.6 min) and on the total duration (mean ± S.D.) of neurological symptoms (from 33.6 ± 23.3 to 18.6 ± 18.0 min) was only significantly reported by previous COCs users (p < .001, for both) by the end of the study period. The POP was well tolerated by each woman and the bleeding pattern was variable with a tendency towards infrequent bleeding.

Conclusions

The present study supports the use of the POP containing desogestrel in a population of women with MA and underlines a positive effect on symptoms of aura, especially in MA sensitive to previous use of COCs.

Oral contraceptives also increase the risk for stroke in women with other underlying risk factors such as certain inherited or acquired thrombophilias, hyperlipidemias, and obesity.

Women with migraine (particularly migraine with aura) who take combination oral contraceptives may be at an increased risk of stroke.

d. Dose-related risk of vascular disease from oral contraceptives

A positive association has been observed between the amount of estrogen and progestogen in oral contraceptives and the risk of vascular disease. A decline in serum high-density lipoproteins (HDL) has been reported with many progestational agents. A decline in serum high-density lipoproteins has been associated with an increased incidence of ischemic heart disease. Because estrogens increase HDL cholesterol, the net effect of an oral contraceptive depends on a balance achieved between doses of estrogen and progestogen and the nature and absolute amount of progestogen used in the contraceptive. The amount of both hormones should be considered in the choice of an oral contraceptive.

A two- to four-fold increase in relative risk of postoperative thromboembolic
complications has been reported with the use of oral contraceptives. The
relative risk of venous thrombosis in women who have predisposing conditions is
twice that of women without such medical conditions. If feasible, oral
contraceptives should be discontinued at least four weeks prior to and for two
weeks after elective surgery of a type associated with an increase in risk of
thromboembolism and during and following prolonged immobilization. Since the
immediate postpartum period is also associated with an increased risk of
thromboembolism, oral contraceptives should be started no earlier than four
weeks after delivery in women who elect not to breast-feed.

Oral contraceptives have been shown to increase both the relative
and attributable risks of cerebrovascular events (thrombotic and hemorrhagic
strokes), although, in general, the risk is greatest among older (> 35 years),
hypertensive women who also smoke. Hypertension was found to be a risk factor
for both users and nonusers, for both types of strokes, while smoking interacted
to increase the risk for hemorrhagic strokes.

In a large study, the relative risk of thrombotic strokes has been shown to
range from 3 for normotensive users to 14 for users with severe hypertension.
The relative risk of hemorrhagic stroke is reported to be 1.2 for nonsmokers who
used oral contraceptives, 2.6 for smokers who did not use oral contraceptives,
7.6 for smokers who used oral contraceptives, 1.8 for normotensive users and
25.7 for users with severe hypertension. The attributable risk is also greater
in older women. Oral contraceptives also increase the risk for stroke in women
with other underlying risk factors such as certain inherited or acquired
thrombophilias, hyperlipidemias, and obesity. Women with migraine (particularly
migraine with aura) who take combination oral contraceptives may be at an
increased risk of stroke.

### Levonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol (trivora) [^115PMVLj]. FDA (2011). Low credibility.

If you take oral contraceptives and need elective surgery, need to stay in bed for a prolonged illness, or have recently delivered a baby, you may be at risk of developing blood clots. You should consult your doctor about stopping oral contraceptives three to four weeks before surgery and not taking oral contraceptives for two weeks after surgery or during bed rest. You should also not take oral contraceptives soon after delivery of a baby or a midtrimester pregnancy termination. It is advisable to wait for at least four weeks after delivery if you are not breast-feeding. If you are breast-feeding, you should wait until you have weaned your child before using the pill. (See also the section on breast-feeding in "GENERAL PRECAUTIONS".)

2. Heart attacks and strokes

Oral contraceptives may increase the tendency to develop strokes (stoppage or rupture of blood vessels in the brain) and angina pectoris and heart attacks (blockage of blood vessels in the heart). Any of these conditions can cause death or serious disability.

Smoking greatly increases the possibility of suffering heart attacks and strokes. Furthermore, smoking and the use of oral contraceptives greatly increase the chances of developing and dying of heart disease.

Women with migraine (especially migraine with aura) who take oral contraceptives also may be at higher risk of stroke.

MIGRAINE AND VASCULAR RISK FACTORS

The role of conventional vascular risk factors on the risk of cardiovascular events in people with migraine is controversial. Migraine, and particularly MA, is associated with an unfavourable cardiovascular risk profile and an increased 10-year predicted risk of coronary heart disease based on the Framingham Risk Score. Frequent headache and long-term migraine are associated with a poorer cardiovascular risk profile. Although people with migraine have an increased risk of ischaemic stroke in the presence of vascular risk factors, several studies have shown that the association between migraine and ischaemic stroke is apparent in people with low Framingham Risk Score. The few exceptions were a positive association with family history of cardiovascular disease, cigarette smoking and oral contraceptives. This agrees with reports that coronary and carotid arteries of individuals with active migraine are found to be less severely affected by atherosclerosis than individuals without migraine, suggesting a non-atherosclerotic mechanism behind the MA-ischaemic stroke link.

Clinical implication

Most migraine patients have MO and are of no or little increased risk of stroke, and they should be reassured instead of being frightened. People with MA are at increased risk of developing cardio/cerebrovascular disease, and while migraine prevention in people with MA has not been shown to reduce stroke risk, management of vascular risk factors in those with MA is important in reducing stroke risk. Comorbidities should be treated adequately (arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus and dyslipidaemia). Migraine patients with aura should be advised to stop smoking, particularly if they also take oral contraceptives. Oral contraceptive use should be carefully discussed in women with MA because of the increased vascular risk. Their prescription should be contraindicated in women with MA and other comorbid vascular risk factor or congenital or acquired thrombophilia.

Thrombophilia and VTE

A previous history of thrombosis is the most significant risk factor for recurrent VTE during pregnancy and postpartum. Among women with pregnancy-related VTE, 20% to 50% have inherited or acquired thrombophilia. Thrombophilia is associated with a 16-fold increased odds of pregnancy-associated stroke. A concurrent PFO may further increase the risk of cerebral embolism. Low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) is the treatment of choice for thromboprophylaxis during pregnancy and postpartum due to its relative safety profile. Many professional societies provide guidelines for thrombophrophylaxis in the antepartum and postpartum setting. American Society of Hematology guidelines set a 1% to 4% VTE threshold risk for recommending antepartum prophylaxis and a 1% to 3% VTE risk threshold for recommending postpartum prophylaxis. In the absence of randomized controlled trials, ACOG recommends that the initiation of pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis should be based on individual risk factors, and discussion of the risks and benefits should take place within a multidisciplinary setting.

Migraine with Aura

Migraine with Aura (MA) is well-recognized as a risk factor for ischemic stroke, particularly in young women. The high incidence of PFO in patients with MA is thought to contribute to the 8-fold increased risk of ischemic stroke in MA patients taking combined hormonal contraception, which should be avoided in these individuals. Migraine is also associated with increased risk of preeclampsia and pregnancy-associated stroke. Of note, no evidence supports aspirin for primary stroke prevention in nonpregnant patients with MA.

### Migraine and risk of haemorrhagic stroke in women: prospective cohort study [^11421SYu]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Migraine is an intermittent often severely disabling headache disorder that involves the neuronal and vascular system and has a prevalence of about 20% in middle aged women. Up to a third of affected patients experience migraine aura, which is characterised by transient neurological symptoms most often involving the visual system.

Several hospital and population based studiesand meta-analyseshave linked migraine, particularly migraine with aura, to an increased risk of ischaemic stroke. Potential explanations for this association include direct vascular involvement as part of the migraine pathophysiology, genetic polymorphisms, and shared risk factors, such as hypertension, smoking, raised cholesterol concentrations, and use of oral contraceptives. In addition, there is increasing evidence of pathology of the vessel wall in migraine, which might also increase the susceptibility to vascular events, including haemorrhagic stroke. Specifically, smooth muscle cell dysfunction, endothelial dysfunction, and involvement of genotypes of the angiotensin converting enzymeand the endothelin receptorhave been suggested.

Data on the association between migraine and haemorrhagic stroke, however, are sparse, mainly because of the generally low incidence of haemorrhagic strokes. Two case-control studies suggested an association, and a large population based study with health insurance data indicated an association between peripartum migraine and increased risk of intracerebral haemorrhage.

A previous report from the Women's Health Study did not find any association between migraine and increased risk of haemorrhagic stroke. After the association between migraine with aura and ischaemic vascular events became more apparent with longer follow-up, however, we re-evaluated the association of migraine and migraine aura status with haemorrhagic stroke after a mean of over 13 years of follow-up.

### Norethisterone and its acetate – what's so special about them? [^111tGrTw]. BMJ Sexual & Reproductive Health (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Progestogens (progestins) are widely used for contraception, in postmenopausal hormone therapy, and in treatment of abnormal uterine bleeding and endometriosis. Norethisterone (NET) and its acetate (NETA) differ from other progestogens by their partial conversion to ethinylestradiol (EE). We review their special characteristics and focus on the clinically relevant risk factors associated with estrogen action, such as migraine with aura and risk of thrombosis.

Methods

Narrative review based on a medical literature (OvidMedline and PubMed) search.

Results

NET converts to significant amounts of EE; 10-20mg NET corresponds to 20–30µg EE. The effects of NET on the endometrium are pronounced, making it a good choice for treating abnormal uterine bleeding, endometriosis, and endometrial hyperplasia. NET also has beneficial effects on bone mineral density and positive or neutral effects on cardiovascular health. Conversely, long-term use of NET is associated with a slightly increased breast cancer risk, and the risk of venous thromboembolism is moderately increased. This risk seems to be dose-dependent; contraceptive use carries no risk, but therapeutic doses might be associated with an increased risk. Studies suggest an association between combinations of EE and progestogens and ischaemic stroke, which in particular concerns women with migraine. No studies have, however, assessed this risk related to the therapeutic use of NET.

Conclusions

NET is a potent progestogen, especially when considering the endometrium. Its partial conversion to EE, however, is important to remember. Clinical consideration is required with women at high risk for either breast cancer or thromboembolism, or experiencing migraine with aura.

Table 2summarises the age and multivariable adjusted hazards ratios for the association between migraine and risk of haemorrhagic stroke. Compared with women who did not report history of migraine, those who reported any history had no increased risk of haemorrhagic stroke (age adjusted hazard ratio 1.04, 95% confidence interval 0.59 to 1.82, P = 0.90). When we made a distinction with regard to migraine aura, however, the results differed. After adjustment for age and compared with women without migraine history, women with active migraine with aura had increased risk of haemorrhagic stroke (2.31, 1.15 to 4.64, P = 0.019). Adjustment for age, history of hypertension, smoking, BMI, alcohol consumption, and total cholesterol concentration (parsimonious model) yielded similar results. Also, adjustment for a large number of covariates via a regression model weighted for a propensity score did not substantially attenuate this finding (2.25, 1.11 to 4.54, P = 0.024). Women who reported active migraine without aura and those who reported previous migraine had no increased risk of haemorrhagic stroke.

The figureshows the age adjusted incidence rates for haemorrhagic stroke for women without a history of migraine, women with active migraine with aura, and those with active migraine without aura. Compared with women with no history of migraine, the increased rates of haemorrhagic stroke for women with active migraine with aura were more apparent towards later years of follow-up.

Age adjusted cumulative incidence of haemorrhagic stroke according to migraine in women

To evaluate the association of migraine with aura with the few subtypes of haemorrhagic stroke (intracerebral haemorrhage n = 44; subarachnoid haemorrhage n = 36) as well as with fatal haemorrhagic stroke (n = 28), we combined women who did not report migraine, reported migraine without aura, and reported previous migraine to form a reference group. The association between active migraine with aura and haemorrhagic stroke was stronger for intracerebral haemorrhages (hazard ratio adjusted for age 2.78, 1.09 to 7.07, P = 0.032) than for subarachnoid haemorrhages (1.73, 0.53 to 5.65, P = 0.37) and stronger for fatal (3.56, 1.23 to 10.31, P = 0.02) than non-fatal haemorrhagic stroke (1.96, 0.78 to 4.93, P = 0.15).

With regard to potential effect modification of the age adjusted association between active migraine with aura and haemorrhagic stroke, we found stronger effect estimates for age 55 and above (3.80, 1.61 to 8.97), no history of hypertension (3.23, 1.45 to 7.20), cholesterol concentrations < 6.2 mmol/l (2.86, 1.36 to 6.01), current use of postmenopausal hormones (2.84, 1.19 to 6.76), non-active smokers (2.70, 1.29 to 5.67), Framingham risk score estimates of coronary heart disease of < 5% (2.98, 1.41 to 6.30), randomisation to vitamin E (2.87, 1.21 to 6.80), and randomisation to aspirin placebo (3.27, 1.26 to 8.49). We did not, however, find any significant effect modification (smallest P value 0.19 for the interaction by age).

### Use of combined hormonal contraceptives among… stacks… [^111y9Xv4]. stacks.cdc.gov (2016). Low credibility.

Use of combined hormonal contraceptives among women with migraines and risk of ischemic stroke Supporting Files 5 2017 By Champaloux, Steven W.; Tepper, Naomi K.; Monsour, Michael;. File Language: English. Details Alternative Title: Am J Obstet Gynecol Personal Author: Description: BACKGROUND: Migraine with aura and combined hormonal contraceptives are independently associated with an increased risk of ischemic stroke. However, little is known about whether there are any joint effects of migraine and hormonal contraceptives on risk of stroke. OBJECTIVE: We sought to estimate the incidence of stroke in women of reproductive age and examine the association among combined hormonal contraceptive use, migraine type, and ischemic stroke. STUDY DESIGN: Migraine headache with and without aura was identified using inpatient or outpatient diagnosis codes.

Current combined hormonal contraceptive use was identified using the National Drug Code from the pharmacy database. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals of ischemic stroke by migraine type and combined hormonal contraceptive use. Compared to those with neither migraine nor combined hormonal contraceptive use, the odds ratio of ischemic stroke was highest among those with migraine with aura using combined hormonal contraceptives; odds ratios were also elevated. for migraine with aura without combined hormonal contraceptive use, migraine without aura and combined hormonal contraceptive use, and migraine without aura without combined hormonal contraceptive use.

CONCLUSION: The joint effect of combined hormonal contraceptives and migraine with aura was associated with a 6-fold increased risk of ischemic stroke compared with neither risk factor. Use of combined hormonal contraceptives did not substantially further increase risk of ischemic stroke among women with migraine without aura. Determining migraine type is critical in assessing safety of combined hormonal contraceptives among women with migraine.

c. Cerebrovascular diseases

Oral contraceptives have been shown to increase both the relative and attributable risks of cerebrovascular events (thrombotic and hemorrhagic strokes), although, in general, the risk is greatest among older (> 35 years), hypertensive women who also smoke. Hypertension was found to be a risk factor for both users and non-users, for both types of strokes, while smoking interacted to increase the risk for hemorrhagic strokes.27 to 29

In a large study, the relative risk of thrombotic strokes has been shown to range from 3 for normotensive users to 14 for users with severe hypertension.30The relative risk of hemorrhagic stroke is reported to be 1.2 for non-smokers who used oral contraceptives, 2.6 for smokers who did not use oral contraceptives, 7.6 for smokers who used oral contraceptives, 1.8 for normotensive users, and 25.7 for users with severe hypertension.30The attributable risk is also greater in older women.3Oral contraceptives also increase the risk for stroke in women with other underlying risk factors such as certain inherited or acquired thrombophilias, hyperlipidemias, and obesity. Women with migraine (particularly migraine with aura) who take combination oral contraceptives may be at an increased risk of stroke.

d. Dose-related risk of vascular disease from oral contraceptives

A positive association has been observed between the amount of estrogen and progestogen in oral contraceptives and the risk of vascular disease.31 to 33A decline in serum high-density lipoproteins (HDL) has been reported with many progestational agents.14 to 16A decline in serum high-density lipoproteins has been associated with an increased incidence of ischemic heart disease. Because estrogens increase HDL cholesterol, the net effect of an oral contraceptive depends on a balance achieved between doses of estrogen and progestogen and the nature and absolute amount of progestogens used in the contraceptives. The amount of both hormones should be considered in the choice of an oral contraceptive.

Minimizing exposure to estrogen and progestogen is in keeping with good principles of therapeutics. For any particular estrogen/progestogen combination, the dosage regimen prescribed should be one which contains the least amount of estrogen and progestogen that is compatible with a low failure rate and the needs of the individual patient. New acceptors of oral contraceptive agents should be started on preparations containing the lowest estrogen content that is judged appropriate for the individual patient.

### Migraine and risk of stroke [^113UFLmS]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

Migraine and pregnancy

The physiological changes during pregnancy, such as venous stasis, oedema and hypercoagulability, combine to make pregnancy and postpartum period a time of increased risk of stroke. While most women experience improvement of migraine during pregnancy, migraine attacks may worsen or develop de novo in a small percentage. Women with menstrual migraine are more likely to experience improvement since the triggering factor (oestrogen fluctuation) is absent during pregnancy. The worsening usually occurs in the first trimester, and involves women suffering from MA rather than MO. Also de novo migraines during pregnancy mostly consist of MA. Women suffering from migraine are at increased risk for several complications during pregnancy including preeclampsia, gestational hypertension, pulmonary embolism, venous thromboembolism and cerebrovascular event such as ischaemic stroke and cerebral haemorrhage. Pregnant women with migraine are more likely to have vascular risk factors, including hypertension, diabetes and smoking. The risk is particularly evident in those women not showing remission or amelioration of migraine attacks.

Clinical implication

Active migraine during pregnancy should be viewed as a potential risk marker for adverse vascular outcomes, especially ischaemic stroke. Women with migraine, particularly those with known stroke risk factors, may benefit from high-risk obstetric monitoring.

Migraine and hormone replacement therapy

There are insufficient data to support a further increased risk of ischaemic stroke in women with any type of migraine who are using hormone replacement therapy.

Clinical implication

After menopause, MA in itself is not a contraindication for the use of hormone-replacement therapy, but stroke risk related to the therapy itself should be considered.

Migraine and Cardiovascular Events

Considerable evidence links migraine, particularly with aura, to cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (Tables 1 and 2). 12, 13, 34, 35, 36, 37 These data have been studied more frequently among women. In a prospective cohort of > 27 000 healthy women > 45 years old with no prior ischemic event from the Women's Health Study, a self‐reported diagnosis of migraine with aura was associated with an increased risk of ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction, and a major cardiovascular event (defined as first instance of non‐fatal ischemic stroke, non‐fatal myocardial infarction, or death because of ischemic event) after adjusting for traditional CVD risk factors, oral contraceptive pill use, hormonal replacement therapy, and statins, but not for the use of NSAIDs, since women enrolled in the Women's Health Study had to be willing to forgo use of NSAIDs throughout the trial. 12 These findings were further confirmed in another prospective cohort of ≈115 000 women aged 25 to 42 years at baseline from the Nurse's Health Study. 34 Women with a physician's diagnosis of migraine had an increased risk of cardiovascular events including cardiovascular mortality over 20 years of follow‐up after adjusting for traditional CVD risk factors, oral contraceptive pill use, hormonal replacement therapy, and NSAID use. 34 A similar observation was seen in middle‐aged women with signs and symptoms of ischemic heart disease, in which migraine was associated with an increased risk of major cardiac events driven by a 2‐fold increase in the risk of stroke adjusting for traditional CVD risk factors and for the severity of underlying coronary artery disease. 35 In the largest cohort study to date (ie, > 500K), of which 70% were women, migraine headache was associated with an increased adjusted risk of ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction, and venous thromboembolism after 19 years of follow‐up (adjusting for traditional risk factors and other comorbidities). In this study, the association between migraine and cardiovascular events was more pronounced in women than in men and an increased risk of peripheral artery disease was also observed in those with migraine. 13 Despite the fact that these studies attempted to control for the traditional CVD risk factors, none compared the relative strength of different factors. Thus, the independent contribution of migraine to cardiovascular events relative to the traditional CVD risk factors remains an important knowledge gap. Table 1 summarizes cohort studies that evaluated the risk of cardiovascular outcomes and migraine exclusively among women, while Table 2 summarizes the outcomes among the subgroup of women who had migraine with aura. It is important to note that while these studies 12, 13, 34, 35, 36, 37 mostly showed an association between migraine and risk of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events even after adjusting for the traditional CVD risk factors (Table 3), only 1 study accounted for NSAID use, 12 while 2 studies adjusted for oral contraceptive pill use. 12, 34 Moreover, none of these studies adjusted for other important emerging non‐traditional risk factors among women such as hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and systemic autoimmune diseases. 38, 39 Whether migraine confers an independent risk, beyond these non‐traditional and less studied risk factors, remains an important knowledge gap.

### Contraception for women in selected circumstances [^114h3jcx]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To review new evidence regarding ten controversial issues in the use of contraceptive methods among women with special conditions and to present World Health Organization recommendations derived in part from this evidence.

Data Sources

We searched MEDLINE and PREMEDLINE databases for English-language articles, published between January 1995 and December 2001, for evidence relevant to ten key contraceptive method and condition combinations: combined oral contraceptive (OC) use among women with hypertension or headaches, combined OC use for emergency contraception and adverse events, progestogen-only contraception use among young women and among breast-feeding women, tubal sterilization among young women, hormonal contraception and intrauterine device use among women who are human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive, have AIDS, or are at high risk of HIV infection. Search terms included: "contraception", "contraceptives, oral", "progestational hormones", "medroxyprogesterone-17 acetate", "norethindrone", "levonorgestrel", "Norplant", "contraceptives, postcoital", "sterilization, tubal", "intrauterine devices", "hypertension", "stroke", "myocardial infarction", "thrombosis", "headache", "migraine", "adverse effects", "bone mineral density", "breast-feeding", "lactation", "age factors", "regret", and "HIV".

Study Selection

From 205 articles, we identified 33 studies published in peer-reviewed journals that specifically examined risks of contraceptive use among women with pre-existing conditions.

Tabulation, Integration, and Results

Combined OC users with hypertension appear to be at increased risk of myocardial infarction and stroke relative to users without hypertension. Combined OC users with migraine appear to be at increased risk of stroke relative to nonusers with migraine. The evidence for the other eight method and condition combinations was either insufficient to draw conclusions or identified no excess risk.

Conclusion

Of ten contraceptive method and condition combinations assessed, the evidence supported an increased risk of cardiovascular complications with combined OC use by women with hypertension or migraine. As new evidence becomes available, assessment of risk and recommendations for use of contraceptive methods can be revised accordingly.

Combined hormonal contraception — risk stratification in women with cardiovascular disease: Combined hormonal contraception (eg, oral, ring, or patch), although effective, may pose significant risk for women depending on the patient's underlying cardiac condition because of the estrogen component. The use of combined hormonal contraception in women with poorly controlled hypertension, aged more than 35 years, who are smokers, or who have migraine with aura, is associated with increased risks for exacerbation of high blood pressure, cardiovascular events, such as stroke and acute myocardial infarction, and thromboembolic events. For women with valvular heart disease, especially those with complicated valvular pathology, combined hormonal contraception may increase the risk of arterial thrombosis and other adverse cardiovascular consequences. Use of combined hormonal contraception in the setting of cardiomyopathy can be associated with fluid retention, which can exacerbate heart failure. Because of these concerns, alternative contraceptive options should be considered in women with prothrombotic states, uncontrolled hypertension, ischemic heart disease, and complicated valvular heart disease.

### Migraine headache: an under-appreciated risk factor for cardiovascular disease in women [^1151QPPE]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Migraine is a prevalent, chronic condition that mostly affects young to middle‐aged women, followed by gradual decline with aging. Migraine carries a considerable physical, social, and economic burden. Shortly after puberty, the prevalence of migraine sharply rises in women and remains much higher compared with men. Women are also more likely to experience more frequent and worse migraine attacks. These observations suggest that sex hormones, particularly estrogen, play an important role in the pathophysiology of migraine. However, it remains unknown if hormonal modulation might help alleviate this condition.

There is a large body of studies linking migraine with cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events, particularly ischemic stroke, in women. This association is more robust for migraine with aura. Although the numbers of events in these studies were small, the high prevalence of migraine worldwide and the young age of the women who suffer this condition should direct attention of future research to evaluate therapies and/or interventions to mitigate this risk. To date, there has been no established therapy to lower cardiovascular risk among women with migraine. Physicians should inquire about migraine history when assessing the cardiovascular risk of women.

Secondly, we used a propensity scoremethod to adjust for confounding. This allowed us to simultaneously adjust for a large number of covariates, which otherwise would not have been possible because of general modelling constraints. The propensity score is the estimated probability of exposure (that is, migraine status) given a set of covariates (that is, the potential confounders). We distinguished between a propensity score for any migraine and a propensity score for migraine with aura. To estimate the propensity score, we used a logistic regression model that included age (as before), systolic blood pressure (increments of 10 mm Hg), antihypertensive treatment, smoking (as before), BMI (as before), alcohol consumption (as before), total cholesterol concentration (as before), exercise (rarely/never, less than once a week, once to three times a week, four or more times a week), menopausal status, postmenopausal use of hormone treatment (never, past, current), history of use of oral contraceptives, history of diabetes, family history of myocardial infarction before the age of 60, annual household income (< $50 000 (£33 000, €40 000), $50 000- < $100 000, ≥ $100 000), highest level of education (less than university degree, university degree, masters degree, or doctorate), use of multivitamins (never, past, current), ethnicity (white versus other), interaction terms for age (< 55, ≥ 55) with smoking, BMI, and oral contraceptive use, and randomised treatment assignments. Use of other lipid measures yielded comparable results. We weighted a Cox proportional hazards model based on propensity score values and used robust estimation of standard errors. We used standardised mortality ratio weights, which assign the value 1 for exposed and the propensity score odds for unexposed.

### Ischemic stroke on hormonal contraceptives: characteristics, mechanisms and outcome [^1176rjSL]. European Stroke Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Systemic contraceptives increase the risk of ischemic stroke but little is known about the characteristics, mechanisms and long-term outcome post stroke of patients on hormonal contraception. We sought to To assess characteristics and outcome of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) in young women using systemic hormonal contraceptives (SHC) and compare them to strokes in non-contraceptive users.

Patients and Methods

Using the Acute STroke Registry and Analysis of Lausanne (ASTRAL), we analyzed demographics, risk factors, clinical, radiological and treatment data of consecutive female patients of < 50years between 2003 to 2015. We compared groups with and without SHC in a logistic regression analysis.

Results

Of the 179 female patients of < 50years during the observation period, 57 (39.6%) used SHC, 71.9% of whom, a combined oral contraceptive pill. On logistic regression contraceptive users were significantly younger but had comparable stroke severity. They had less migraine with aura and tobacco use, and more hyperlipidaemia. Also, contraceptive users had significantly less intra and extracranial stenosis and occlusion on arterial imaging, but more focal hypoperfusion on CT-perfusion. Undetermined mechanism of stroke was more frequent with SHC users, whereas rare mechanisms were more frequent in non-users. The contraceptive user group had a more favourable adjusted 12-month outcome with significantly fewer ischemic recurrences after stopping systemic contraception in all.

Conclusion

Contraceptive users with ischemic strokes are younger and have lesser tobacco use and migraine with aura and more hyperlipidemia. Their stroke mechanism is more often undetermined using a standardised work-up, and their adjusted long-term outcome is more favourable with less stroke recurrence.

### Medical contraindications to estrogen and contraceptive use among women veterans [^116kYEvQ]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Women veterans have high rates of medical comorbidities and may be particularly vulnerable to adverse health outcomes associated with unintended pregnancy.

Objectives

The objective of the study was to estimate the prevalence of medical contraindications to estrogen-containing combined hormonal contraception among women veterans of reproductive age and to evaluate the relationship between contraindications and contraceptive use.

Study Design

This was a secondary analysis of data from a cross-sectional, telephone-based survey with a national sample of 2302 female veterans, aged 18–45 years, who use the Veterans Administration Healthcare System for primary care. This analysis included women at risk of unintended pregnancy, defined as heterosexually active and not pregnant or trying to conceive and with no history of hysterectomy or infertility. Seven contraindications to combined hormonal contraception were identified using survey data or medical diagnosis codes: hypertension; coronary artery disease; active migraine in women older than 35 years or migraine with aura; smoking in women older than 35 years; and a history of thromboembolism, stroke, or breast cancer. Outcomes were current use of combined hormonal contraception and contraceptive method type (combined hormonal contraception, and other prescription methods, nonprescription methods or no method). Multivariable logistic and multinomial regression were used to assess the relationship between contraindications and combined hormonal contraception use and method type, respectively.

Results

Among 1169 women veterans at risk of unintended pregnancy, 339 (29%) had at least 1 contraindication to combined hormonal contraception. The most prevalent conditions were hypertension (14.9%) and migraine (8.7%). In adjusted analyses, women with contraindications were less likely than women without contraindications to report use of combined hormonal contraception (adjusted odds ratio, 0.54, 95% confidence interval, 0.37–0.79). Relative to use of combined hormonal contraception, women with contraindications were more likely than women without contraindications to use other prescription methods (adjusted odds ratio, 1.74, 95% confidence interval, 1.17–2.60), nonprescription methods (adjusted odds ratio, 1.96, 95% confidence interval, 1.19–3.22), and no method (adjusted odds ratio, 2.29, 95% confidence interval, 1.35–3.89).

Conclusion

Women veterans at risk of unintended pregnancy have a high burden of medical contraindications to estrogen. Women with contraindications were less likely to use combined hormonal contraceptive methods but were more likely to use no method, suggesting an unmet need for contraception in this medically vulnerable population.

### Migraine and risk of cardiovascular disease in women [^115LNvMy]. JAMA (2006). Excellent credibility.

Context

Migraine with aura has been associated with an adverse cardiovascular risk profile and prothrombotic factors that, along with migraine-specific physiology, may increase the risk of vascular events. Although migraine with aura has been associated with increased risk of ischemic stroke, an association with cardiovascular disease (CVD) and, specifically, coronary events remains unclear.

Objective

To evaluate the association between migraine with and without aura and subsequent risk of overall and specific CVD.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Prospective cohort study of 27,840 US women aged 45 years or older who were participating in the Women's Health Study, were free of CVD and angina at study entry (1992–1995), and who had information on self-reported migraine and aura status, and lipid measurements. This report is based on follow-up data through March 31, 2004.

Main Outcome Measures

The primary outcome measure was the combined end point of major CVD (first instance of nonfatal ischemic stroke, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or death due to ischemic CVD); other measures were first ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization, angina, and death due to ischemic CVD.

Results

At baseline, 5125 women (18.4%) reported any history of migraine; of the 3610 with active migraine (migraine in the prior year), 1434 (39.7%) indicated aura symptoms. During a mean of 10 years of follow-up, 580 major CVD events occurred. Compared with women with no migraine history, women who reported active migraine with aura had multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios of 2.15 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.58–2.92; P < .001) for major CVD, 1.91 (95% CI, 1.17–3.10; P = 0.01) for ischemic stroke, 2.08 (95% CI, 1.30–3.31; P = 0.002) for myocardial infarction, 1.74 (95% CI, 1.23–2.46; P = 0.002) for coronary revascularization, 1.71 (95% CI, 1.16–2.53; P = 0.007) for angina, and 2.33 (95% CI, 1.21–4.51; P = 0.01) for ischemic CVD death. After adjusting for age, there were 18 additional major CVD events attributable to migraine with aura per 10 000 women per year. Women who reported active migraine without aura did not have increased risk of any vascular events or angina.

Conclusions

In this large, prospective cohort of women, active migraine with aura was associated with increased risk of major CVD, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, and death due to ischemic CVD, as well as with coronary revascularization and angina. Active migraine without aura was not associated with increased risk of any CVD event.

### Migraine and cardiovascular disease: systematic review and meta-analysis [^116KC6oT]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

The results of this meta-analysis indicate that people with migraine are at an increased risk of ischaemic stroke. This increased risk is only apparent in those who have migraine with aura and not in those with migraine without aura, the relative risk being double. In addition, the results suggest an approximately twofold higher risk among women compared with men. Factors that further increased the risk of ischaemic stroke were age less than 45 years, smoking, and use of oral contraceptives. Among people with migraine, the risk of transient ischaemic attacks seemed to be higher than that for ischaemic stroke. In contrast, we did not find an association with haemorrhagic stroke. We also did not find an association between any migraine type and myocardial infarction or death due to cardiovascular disease. Only one study investigated the association between migraine with aura and these events, which showed a twofold increased risk of myocardial infarction and death due to cardiovascular disease. The risk for angina was increased by about 30% in the pooled analysis.

### Migraine and risk of haemorrhagic stroke in women: prospective cohort study [^1141DS8T]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Clinical implications

Migraine with aura has been consistently linked with an increased risk of ischaemic stroke and might also be a marker of increased risk for other ischaemic events. Our results extend those previous findings and suggest that migraine with aura might also be a marker for increased risk of haemorrhagic stroke. Because of the relatively low attributable risk (four additional haemorrhagic strokes associated with migraine with aura per 10 000 women per year), however, there are no immediate implications for clinicians or patients other than the evaluation of prevalent cardiovascular risk factors that might influence ischaemic and haemorrhagic vascular events.

Unanswered questions and future research

There are many unanswered questions, particularly involving specifics on migraine aura and biological mechanisms linking migraine with aura to an increased risk of haemorrhagic stroke. The low attributable risk might mean that the increased risk of haemorrhagic stroke is limited to a subgroup of patients with migraine with aura. In addition to studies targeting potential biological mechanisms, future collaborative efforts are needed to study whether migraine aura specifics or the course of migraine influences risk of subsequent ischaemic and haemorrhagic vascular events.

In a large study, the relative risk of thrombotic strokes has been shown to
range from 3 for normotensive users to 14 for users with severe hypertension.
The relative risk of hemorrhagic stroke is reported to be 1.2 for nonsmokers who
used oral contraceptives, 2.6 for smokers who did not use oral contraceptives,
7.6 for smokers who used oral contraceptives, 1.8 for normotensive users and
25.7 for users with severe hypertension. The attributable risk is also greater
in older women. Oral contraceptives also increase the risk for stroke in women
with other underlying risk factors such as certain inherited or acquired
thrombophilias, hyperlipidemias, and obesity. Women with migraine (particularly
migraine with aura) who take combination oral contraceptives may be at an
increased risk of stroke.

A positive association has been observed between the amount of
estrogen and progestogen in oral contraceptives and the risk of vascular
disease. A decline in serum high-density lipoproteins (HDL) has been reported
with many progestational agents. A decline in serum high-density lipoproteins
has been associated with an increased incidence of ischemic heart disease.

contraceptive depends on a balance achieved between doses of estrogen and
progestogen and the nature and absolute amount of progestogens used in the
contraceptive. The amount of both hormones should be considered in the choice of
an oral contraceptive.

Minimizing exposure to estrogen and progestogen is in keeping with good
principles of therapeutics. For any particular estrogen/progestogen combination,
the dosage regimen prescribed should be one which contains the least amount of
estrogen and progestogen that is compatible with a low failure rate and the
needs of the individual patient. New acceptors of oral contraceptive agents
should be started on preparations containing the lowest estrogen content which
is judged appropriate for the individual patient.

There are two studies which have shown persistence of risk of
vascular disease for ever-users of oral contraceptives. In a study in the United
States, the risk of developing myocardial infarction after discontinuing oral
contraceptives persisted for at least 9 years for women 40 to 49 years old who
had used oral contraceptives for five or more years but this increased risk was
not demonstrated in other age groups. In another study in Great Britain, the
risk of developing cerebrovascular disease persisted for at least 6 years after
discontinuation of oral contraceptives, although excess risk was very small.
However, both studies were performed with oral contraceptive formulations
containing 50 micrograms or higher of estrogens.

### Levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol (delyla) [^1149AjXs]. FDA (2014). Low credibility.

A two- to four-fold increase in relative risk of postoperative thromboembolic complications has been reported with the use of oral contraceptives. The relative risk of venous thrombosis in women who have predisposing conditions is twice that of women without such medical conditions. If feasible, oral contraceptives should be discontinued at least four weeks prior to and for two weeks after elective surgery of a type associated with an increase in risk of thromboembolism and during and following prolonged immobilization. Since the immediate postpartum period is also associated with an increased risk of thromboembolism, oral contraceptives should be started no earlier than four weeks after delivery in women who elect not to breast-feed or after a midtrimester pregnancy termination.

c. Cerebrovascular diseases

Oral contraceptives have been shown to increase both the relative and attributable risks of cerebrovascular events (thrombotic and hemorrhagic strokes), although, in general, the risk is greatest among older (> 35 years), hypertensive women who also smoke. Hypertension was found to be a risk factor for both users and nonusers, for both types of strokes, while smoking interacted to increase the risk for hemorrhagic strokes.

In a large study, the relative risk of thrombotic strokes has been shown to range from 3 for normotensive users to 14 for users with severe hypertension. The relative risk of hemorrhagic stroke is reported to be 1.2 for nonsmokers who used oral contraceptives, 2.6 for smokers who did not use oral contraceptives, 7.6 for smokers who used oral contraceptives, 1.8 for normotensive users and 25.7 for users with severe hypertension. The attributable risk is also greater in older women. Oral contraceptives also increase the risk for stroke in women with other underlying risk factors such as certain inherited or acquired thrombophilias. Women with migraine (particularly migraine/headaches with focal neurological symptoms, see CONTRAINDICATIONS) who take combination oral contraceptives may be at an increased risk of stroke.

### Migraine and stroke [^112695zQ]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

For years, researchers have been looking for underlying mechanisms of increased risk of stroke in women, especially for those who are premenopausal and without recognised cardiovascular risk factors. Studies have shown a link of migraine, and especially aura, to increased levels of estradiol (eg, oral contraceptive pill use, pregnancy), thrombocytosis and erythrocytosis, von Willebrand factor antigen, fibrinogen, tissue plasminogen activator antigen and endothelial microparticles. Hypercoagulability induced by these changes could explain the increased risk of stroke for this specific population of young female migraineurs. However, the exact mechanisms linking hypercoagulability to migraine are not yet explored. One theory is that micro-embolus following platelet aggregation could cause either migraine aura or transient ischaemic attack (TIA), and that migraine aura represents a TIA equivalent. This can, to some extent, be demonstrated by increased fibrinogen, D-dimer and galectin-3 levels in patients with migraine. In addition, experimental work in rodent models shows that hypoperfusion caused by injections of air, cholesterol crystals and microspheres could trigger CSD without infarction. Other theories suggest that CSD may lead to weakening of the blood–brain barrier and endothelial damage, or that migraine may be linked to hypercoagulability through stress.

Over the past few years, evidence from genetic influence on the migraine–stroke relation emerges, with genetic predisposition playing an important role in the occurrence of both migraine and ischaemic stroke. For example, Kutai et al showed a high incidence of F5 A1691G and F2 G20210A in a group of paediatric patients with migraine and significantly increased factor VIII activity in 25% of the same group of patients from a population of Jewish origin. Therefore, the author recommended thrombophilia survey in patients with migraine and indicated more attention to the shift towards hypercoagulation either during or between migraine attacks.

Independent risk factors of ischaemic stroke in migraineurs include migraine with aura, women, age < 45 years, oral contraceptive use and smoking. Risk factors specific to migraineurs may include migraine-specific medications including triptans and ergot alkaloids. These potent vasoconstrictors may lead to increased blood pressures and thus increase the risk of ischaemic stroke.

### Migraine and functional outcome from ischemic cerebral events in women [^113SnYug]. Circulation (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Studies have linked migraine with aura to an increased risk of ischemic stroke, particularly among women. Data on the relationship of migraine and functional outcome from ischemic cerebral events are sparse.

Methods and Results

This was a prospective cohort study among 27 852 women enrolled in the Women's Health Study for whom we had information on migraine and measured cholesterol values and who had no prior stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) at baseline. Migraine was classified into no history of migraine, active migraine with aura, active migraine without aura, and past history of migraine. Possible functional outcomes were no stroke or TIA, TIA, and stroke with modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score 0 to 1, mRS 2 to 3, and mRS 4 to 6. We used multinomial logistic regression to evaluate the relationship of migraine with functional outcomes after ischemic stroke. During a mean of 13.5 years of follow-up, 398 TIAs and 345 ischemic strokes occurred. Compared with women without history of migraine and who did not experience a TIA or stroke, women who reported migraine with aura had adjusted relative risk (95% confidence interval) of 1.56 (1.03 to 2.36) for TIA, 2.33 (1.37 to 3.97) for stroke with mRS 0 to 1, 0.82 (0.30 to 2.24) for mRS 2 to 3, and 1.18 (0.28 to 4.97) for mRS 4 to 6. The risk of any outcome was not significantly elevated for women who experienced migraine without aura or who had a past history of migraine.

Conclusions

Results of this large prospective cohort suggest that women with migraine with aura are at increased risk of experiencing TIA or ischemic stroke with good functional outcome.

### Migraine and its association with stroke in pregnancy: a national examination [^111kkKEq]. Journal of Women's Health (2024). Medium credibility.

Background: Migraine prevalence has been estimated to be as high as 25% during reproductive years. Despite this, and the known significantly lower odds of acute stroke being correctly diagnosed among women versus men, little is known about the migraine-stroke connection in this vulnerable population. Our study seeks to provide a consolidated examination of cerebrovascular and obstetric complications of migraines in pregnant women and to evaluate the role of concurrent comorbidities. Methods: We utilized the 2016–2020 Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project's National Inpatient Sample with the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision diagnostic codes to compare pregnant patients with migraines with those without migraines. Multivariable logistic regression was used to examine the incidence of subtypes of stroke while controlling for confounding variables. Results: Overall, 19,825,525 pregnant patients were evaluated; 219,175 (1.1%) had a concomitant diagnosis of migraine. Pregnant patients with migraines were more likely to suffer ischemic (0.1% versus 0.0%) or hemorrhagic stroke (0.3% versus 0.1%). On multivariate analysis, acute ischemic stroke was most strongly associated with migraine with aura (odds ratio [OR], 23.26; 95% confidence interval [CI] 18.46–29.31), followed by migraine without aura (OR, 8.15; 95% CI, 4.79–13.88). Conclusions: Pregnant women with migraine are at a significantly increased risk for both ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke. Pregnant women with migraines should be cautioned that they may be at an increased risk of stroke, particularly if they are experiencing an aura, and encouraged to contact their medical providers to rule out neurological complications.

Multiple meta‐analyses have also confirmed these associations. In 3 meta‐analyses that focused on ischemic stroke, the consistent finding was that migraine was associated with ≈2‐fold increase in the adjusted risk of ischemic stroke. 40, 41, 42 This association was observed only in women but not in men. 40, 42 In 2 of these meta‐analyses only migraine with aura was associated with ischemic stroke, 41, 42 but the earlier meta‐analysis demonstrated an association between migraine and ischemic stroke irrespective of aura. 40 One meta‐analysis of 15 studies evaluating the adjusted risk of ischemic heart disease with migraine showed that migraine, particularly with aura, was associated with angina and myocardial infarction. 43 In the largest meta‐analysis of cohort studies (> 1 million individuals), migraine was associated with an increased adjusted risk of major cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events, driven by an increased risk of myocardial infarction and stroke. 3 This effect was more pronounced among those with aura and among women. While these observational studies and meta‐analyses have consistently demonstrated an association between migraine and cardiac events, particularly stroke, age might play a role in this association. For example, in 1 study of older patients with migraine (mean age 69 years), migraine with and without aura was not associated with risk of stroke at a mean follow‐up of 11 years. 44 Nevertheless, young women provide an opportunity to understand the relationship of migraine to vascular events without masking with the traditional causes of stroke (ie, atherosclerotic disease or cardio‐embolic).

### Combined hormonal contraception use in reproductive-age women with contraindications to estrogen use [^113NeM76]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's US Medical Eligibility Criteria for Contraceptive Use recommends that combined hormonal contraceptives (ie, birth control pills, contraceptive patch, vaginal ring) should be avoided in women with specific medical conditions because of the increased risk of cardiovascular events associated with estrogen use. Whether women with category 3 (theoretical or proven risk usually outweigh the advantages) or category 4 (unacceptable health risk) contraindications are appropriately avoiding estrogen-containing combined hormonal contraceptives is unknown.

Objective

We describe the prevalence of combined hormonal contraceptive use among a sample of reproductive-age women with medical contraindications to estrogen use. Our hypothesis was that women with categories 3 and 4 contraindications would use estrogen-containing contraception less often than women without medical contraindications. We also explored whether inappropriate estrogen-containing contraceptive use is related to contraceptive provider characteristics.

Study Design

Data are from the baseline survey of the MyNewOptions study, which included privately insured women residing in Pennsylvania aged 18–40 years, who were sexually active and not intending pregnancy in the next year. Women were surveyed about their medical conditions, contraceptive use, and characteristics of their contraceptive provider. Women were considered to have a contraindication to combined hormonal contraceptives if they reported a category 3 or category 4 contraindication: hypertension, smokers older than age 35 years, a history of venous thromboembolism, diabetes with complications, coronary artery disease, systemic lupus erythematosus with antiphospholipid antibodies, breast cancer, or migraine headaches with aura. χ² tests for general association were used to compare combined hormonal contraceptives use, contraceptive health provider characteristics, and sociodemographic data in women with and without contraindications to estrogen use.

Results

The MyNewOptions baseline study sample included 987 adult women who were mostly young (46% were 18–25 years), white (94%), employed (70%), and married or cohabiting (54%). Thirteen percent (n = 130) of the sample had a medical contraindication to estrogen-containing contraceptive use: migraine with aura (81%) was the most common contraindication, followed by smokers older than age 35 years (7%), hypertension (11%), history of venous thromboembolism (4%), and diabetes with complications (2%). High use of combined hormonal contraceptives was reported among the women with medical contraindications to estrogen at 39% (n = 51). This was not statistically different from women without a medical contraindication (47%, P = 0.1). Among the 130 women with a contraindication, whether they did or did not use an estrogen-containing contraceptive did not vary by education level, income, or weight category. With respect to their contraceptive prescribers, there were no differences in prescriber specialty, provider type, or clinic type comparing women using and not using an estrogen-containing contraceptive.

Conclusion

Among this study sample of reproductive-age women, there was a high rate of combined hormonal contraceptive use in women with a medical contraindication to estrogen use. These women may be at an increased risk for cardiovascular events. Processes need to be improved to ensure that women with medical contraindications to estrogen-containing contraception are being offered the safest and most effective methods, including long-acting reversible contraceptives, such as intrauterine devices and the contraceptive implant.

### Ischemic stroke in young women: a nested case-control study using the UK general practice research database [^111Xsebk]. Stroke (2004). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Estimates of the incidence of ischemic stroke in young women vary widely from 0.9 to 8.9 per 100,000 per year. This study was conducted to determine the incidence and risk factors for ischemic stroke in young women in the UK.

Methods

Women aged 15 to 49 with a first diagnosis and supporting evidence of ischemic stroke between January 1, 1992, and December 31, 1998, were identified from the UK General Practice Research Database. Age-specific incidence rates were calculated and a nested case-control study was conducted with up to 6 controls randomly selected and matched to each case by year of birth and general practice. Crude and adjusted odds ratios (ORs) were calculated using conditional logistic regression.

Results

The incidence of ischemic stroke was 3.56/100 000 per year. Factors associated with an increased risk were heart disease (OR, 10.5), heavy alcohol consumption (OR, 8.5), previous venous thromboembolism (OR, 6.2), treated diabetes mellitus (OR, 4.7), hypertension (OR, 4.6), migraine (OR, 2.3), and use of combined oral contraceptives (OR, 2.3). Light alcohol consumption was found to be protective (OR, 0.17).

Conclusions

The crude incidence rate was lower than previously reported for the USA and Europe but higher than that reported for the UK Oxford Region. This could be because of an under-representation of mild cases or because of a true lower incidence in the UK compared with the USA and the rest of Europe. The results of the case-control study are consistent with previous studies of ischemic stroke in young women.

Metabolic syndrome

Recommendations

Metabolic syndrome is a clinical condition in which multiple metabolic abnormalities occur in the human body, including central obesity (abdominal obesity), dyslipidaemia, hypertension and elevated fasting blood glucose. Metabolic syndrome is increasingly common. Interventions of every single risk factor of the metabolic syndrome are recommended, including lifestyle measures and pharmacotherapy (ie, medications for BP lowering, lipid-lowering, glycaemic control, etc). Detailed interventions refer to relevant sections on 'hypertension', 'abnormal glucose metabolism', 'dyslipidaemia' of this guideline.

Sleep-disordered breathing

Recommendations

Screening for patients with sleep apnoea requires a detailed history. The screening methods include structured questionnaires such as the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, Berlin Questionnaire, physical examination. And polysomnography may be considered depending on the patients' condition (class IIb; level of evidence C).
The effectiveness of treatment for sleep apnoea in stroke prevention is still not well established (class IIb; level of evidence C).

Migraine

Recommendations

For women and geriatric patients with migraine with aura, smoking cessation is recommended (class I; level of evidence B).
For women with active migraine with aura, withdrawal of oral contraceptives (OCs), especially those containing oestrogen, should be considered (class IIa; level of evidence B).
Treatments to reduce migraine frequency (especially for migraines with specific aura symptoms) might be able to reduce the risk of stroke (class IIa; level of evidence B).
For patients with migraine, the clinical benefit of closing PFO for the prevention of stroke is unproven (class III; level of evidence B).

Hyperhomocysteinaemia

Recommendations

Hyperhomocysteinaemia is a risk factor of stroke (level of evidence A). For patients with hyperhomocysteinaemia, the use of folic acid or folic acid in combination with cobalamin (B12) and pyridoxine (B6) might be effective in the prevention of stroke (class IIa; level of evidence B).

Elevated Lp(a)

Recommendations

The clinical benefit of using lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] in stroke risk prediction is not well established (class IIb; level of evidence B).
The effectiveness of niacin in lowing Lp(a) for the prevention of ischaemic stroke is not well established (class IIb; level of evidence B).

Directions for future research

Additional research is needed to delineate in more detail the association between migraine and cardiovascular disease. Future studies need to be adequately powered, should use a strict diagnosis of migraine, should include aura status, should present results for clearly defined cardiovascular events such as ischaemic stroke and myocardial infarction (not just combined end points), and should present results stratified by important and biologically meaningful modifying factors in addition to overall analyses. Furthermore, studies need to control for risk factors associated with cardiovascular disease. Finally, markers of migraine severity, including frequency of attacks and frequency of aura should be considered in the association between migraine and cardiovascular disease.

### Effectiveness of the progestin-only pill for migraine treatment in women: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116TcGCz]. Cephalalgia (2018). Low credibility.

Background Migraine is highly prevalent in women (18%). Peak morbidity affects their most productive years, coinciding with peak fertility. Hormonal contraception is often tailored for migraine prevention. Estrogen-containing contraceptives may be contraindicated in women experiencing migraine with aura due to the risk of vascular events. While improvements in migraine with a progestin-only pill (POP), which inhibits ovulation are documented, the strength and quality of evidence has not been formally evaluated. Objectives To determine the effectiveness of progestin-only contraceptives for migraine treatment by systematic review and meta-analysis. Data sources and selection MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane Libraries were searched (1980 to September 2016) for studies on progestin-only treatments for migraine. Studies in English on > 4 non-menopausal women aged 18–50 with migraine diagnosed by formal criteria were included. Data extraction and analysis Data were quality-assessed using the GRADE system. A random effects model was used for pooled analyses. Results Pooled analyses of four studies demonstrated that desogestrel 75mcg/day, POP significantly but modestly reduced the number of migraine attacks and migraine days. Reduced intensity and duration, reduced analgesic and triptan use were observed, along with improved headache-related quality of life. GRADE analysis indicated evidence was low to very low for each outcome measure. Adverse effects resulted in treatment cessation for < 10% of participants. Two studies compared desogestrel POP to a combined oral contraceptive, demonstrating similar migraine outcomes for both treatments. Conclusions The desogestrel POP shows promise in improving migraine in women. Current evidence is observational and based on small samples of women using only one oral progestin-only formulation. Further randomized trials on additional progestin-only contraceptives are required to confirm their role in migraine management.
