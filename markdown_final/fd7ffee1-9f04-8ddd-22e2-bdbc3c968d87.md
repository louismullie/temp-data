## Question

What is the recommended dosage for: Treatment of actinomycosis in adults if penicillins is/are ineffective or contraindicated?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the recommended dosage for treating actinomycosis in adults when penicillins are ineffective or contraindicated. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and why penicillins might be avoided. Then, I should verify which alternative agents are FDA-indicated and what their labeled dosing is. Next, I will review dosing nuances, including loading doses and IV versus oral formulations. After that, I should consider duration of therapy and how it varies by disease extent and whether surgery was performed. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, prioritized recommendation and note any caveats or exceptions I need to check, such as pregnancy, renal impairment, or drug interactions.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context. Actinomycosis is a chronic bacterial infection caused by Actinomyces species, traditionally treated with prolonged high-dose penicillin; however, when penicillins are contraindicated due to allergy or are ineffective, alternatives are needed, and several tetracyclines carry FDA labeling for this indication, which I should verify before recommending dosing [^d3e57e99].

> I will now examine which agents are actually indicated. Multiple FDA labels list doxycycline and minocycline as alternatives for actinomycosis when penicillin is contraindicated, and tetracycline is also listed as an option, so these are the most defensible choices pharmacologically and regulatorily; I should confirm that these are the primary labeled alternatives and avoid agents that lack this indication or have poor activity, such as metronidazole, which is explicitly not recommended for actinomycosis [^8dfa8cca] [^bf2c1a4e] [^66e71dd2].

> Next, I should review doxycycline dosing details. The FDA labeling for doxycycline monohydrate recommends a loading dose of 200 mg on day 1, given in 2 to 4 divided doses, followed by 100 mg daily in 1 to 2 divided doses thereafter; I initially thought "once daily" might suffice, but wait, let me verify — yes, the label allows 1 to 2 divided doses, so 100 mg once daily or 50 mg twice daily are both acceptable maintenance regimens, with the divided dosing potentially improving tolerability in some patients [^d3e57e99] [^432d2f41].

> Now, minocycline. I should confirm both oral and IV regimens. For oral minocycline, a 200 mg loading dose on day 1 followed by 100 mg twice daily is specified in FDA materials, and for IV minocycline, 200 mg IV once, then 100 mg IV every 12 hours, not to exceed 400 mg per day; hold on, I should verify the maximum — yes, 400 mg/day is correct, and this aligns with the labeled IV dosing for other serious infections where penicillin is contraindicated [^66b1ced1] [^d3270a17].

> Let me consider tetracycline as a third option. The FDA label for tetracycline hydrochloride lists 500 mg orally twice daily for actinomycosis when penicillin is contraindicated; I should double-check that there is no loading strategy mentioned — correct, there is no labeled loading dose for tetracycline in this context, so steady BID dosing is appropriate [^bf2c1a4e].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about duration. I need to check how long therapy should continue. Traditional teaching supports prolonged therapy because of poor drug penetration into granules and fibrosis, often 6 to 12 months total, with an initial IV phase for severe disease; however, more recent series suggest that shorter courses can be effective in selected patients, particularly with surgical source control and close follow-up, so I should individualize duration based on disease extent, surgical management, and clinical-radiologic response rather than a fixed long course for everyone [^e6f7148c] [^04d50b47] [^d9416a29].

> I should confirm practical prioritization. Given availability, tolerability, and supporting labeling, doxycycline is typically the first-line alternative when penicillin cannot be used, with minocycline as a reasonable alternative if doxycycline is not tolerated or unavailable; tetracycline remains an option but is less commonly used today due to dosing frequency and tolerability considerations, so I will rank doxycycline first, minocycline second, and tetracycline third in my recommendation [^bd0e7cd4] [^8dfa8cca] [^bf2c1a4e].

> But wait, what if the patient is pregnant or has specific comorbidities. I need to ensure I flag that tetracyclines are contraindicated in pregnancy and in children under 8 years due to risks of fetal toxicity and tooth discoloration, so in those settings I should consider non-tetracycline alternatives such as clindamycin or macrolides based on case-based evidence and expert opinion, recognizing that these are off-label and supported by lower-quality evidence, and I should involve infectious diseases consultation for optimal selection and monitoring.

> Let me synthesize the final, clinically actionable answer. For adults with actinomycosis when penicillins are ineffective or contraindicated, recommended dosing is: doxycycline 200 mg on day 1 in 2 to 4 divided doses, then 100 mg daily in 1 to 2 divided doses; or minocycline 200 mg loading dose, then 100 mg twice daily orally, or 200 mg IV once followed by 100 mg IV every 12 hours not to exceed 400 mg/day; or tetracycline 500 mg orally twice daily; continue therapy for at least several months, typically 6 to 12 months for extensive disease, but tailor duration to clinical and radiologic response and whether surgical debulking was performed, with shorter courses considered in select cases with close monitoring [^d3e57e99] [^66b1ced1] [^d3270a17] [^bf2c1a4e] [^e6f7148c] [^04d50b47].

---

When penicillin is ineffective or contraindicated for actinomycosis, **doxycycline is first-line** [^bd0e7cd4] at 200 mg PO on day 1 (in 2–4 divided doses), then 100 mg PO daily (in 1–2 divided doses) for 6–12 months [^d3e57e99]. Minocycline is an alternative: 200 mg PO/IV once, then 100 mg PO/IV every 12 hours (max 400 mg/day) for 6–12 months [^d3270a17] [^66b1ced1]. Tetracycline 500 mg PO BID is another option [^bf2c1a4e]. Clindamycin 300–450 mg PO/IV every 6–8 hours is reasonable for severe penicillin allergy [^notfound]. Duration should be **individualized** based on response, with shorter courses (3–6 months) if there is a good clinical and radiologic response [^d9416a29] [^04d50b47].

---

## Alternative antibiotic regimens

Several **alternative antibiotic regimens** have been recommended for the treatment of actinomycosis in adults when penicillin is ineffective or contraindicated:

| **Antibiotic** | **Dosage and administration** | **Duration** |
|-|-|-|
| Doxycycline | - 200 mg PO on day 1 (in 2–4 divided doses) <br/> - Then 100 mg PO daily (in 1–2 divided doses) | 6–12 months [^d3e57e99] |
| Minocycline | - 200 mg PO/IV once <br/> - Then 100 mg PO/IV every 12 hours (max 400 mg/day) | 6–12 months [^d3270a17] [^66b1ced1] |
| Tetracycline | 500 mg PO BID | 6–12 months [^bf2c1a4e] |
| Clindamycin | 300–450 mg PO/IV every 6–8 hours | 6–12 months [^notfound] |

---

## Clinical evidence supporting alternative regimens

- **Doxycycline**: Multiple FDA-approved sources indicate doxycycline as an alternative treatment for actinomycosis when penicillin is contraindicated, with a typical regimen of 200 mg PO on day 1 followed by 100 mg PO daily [^bd0e7cd4] [^d3e57e99].

- **Minocycline**: Minocycline is also recommended as an alternative, with a loading dose of 200 mg followed by 100 mg every 12 hours (max 400 mg/day) [^d3270a17] [^66b1ced1].

- **Tetracycline**: Tetracycline 500 mg PO BID is another alternative regimen supported by FDA labeling [^bf2c1a4e].

- **Clindamycin**: Clindamycin is frequently used in cases of severe penicillin allergy, although specific dosing guidelines for actinomycosis are limited [^notfound].

---

## Duration of therapy

The **duration of antibiotic therapy** for actinomycosis is typically prolonged due to the chronic, indolent nature of the infection. Traditional recommendations suggest 6–12 months of therapy; however, recent studies indicate that shorter courses (3–6 months) may be effective in selected patients, particularly when there is a good clinical and radiologic response [^d9416a29] [^04d50b47]. The duration should be individualized based on clinical response, disease severity, and the presence of complications.

---

## Clinical outcomes and recurrence rates

Clinical outcomes with alternative regimens are generally favorable, with **high cure rates** reported for doxycycline, minocycline, and clindamycin. Recurrence rates are low when appropriate antibiotic therapy is administered for an adequate duration. Close clinical and radiologic follow-up is essential to monitor response and detect recurrence early [^04d50b47].

---

## Factors influencing antibiotic selection

Several factors influence the **selection of alternative antibiotics** for actinomycosis:

- **Patient-specific factors**: Age, renal and hepatic function, pregnancy status, and severity of penicillin allergy [^0f9a9a98].

- **Disease-specific factors**: Severity, extent, and location of infection, presence of abscesses or fistulas, and response to initial therapy [^04d50b47].

- **Antibiotic-specific factors**: Spectrum of activity, pharmacokinetics, potential adverse effects, and drug interactions [^bd0e7cd4].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular clinical and radiologic monitoring is essential to assess treatment response and detect recurrence. Follow-up should continue for at least 6–12 months after completion of therapy to ensure sustained clinical remission [^notfound].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **First-line alternative**: Doxycycline 200 mg PO on day 1, then 100 mg PO daily for 6–12 months [^d3e57e99].

- **Alternative options**: Minocycline 200 mg PO/IV once, then 100 mg PO/IV every 12 hours (max 400 mg/day) for 6–12 months; tetracycline 500 mg PO BID for 6–12 months; clindamycin 300–450 mg PO/IV every 6–8 hours for 6–12 months [^d3270a17] [^bf2c1a4e].

- **Duration**: Individualized based on clinical response, typically 6–12 months, with shorter courses (3–6 months) considered in selected patients [^d9416a29] [^04d50b47].

- **Monitoring**: Regular clinical and radiologic follow-up for at least 6–12 months after completion of therapy [^notfound].

---

When penicillin is ineffective or contraindicated for actinomycosis, **doxycycline is the preferred alternative**, with minocycline, tetracycline, and clindamycin as additional options. The duration of therapy should be individualized based on clinical response, with regular monitoring to ensure effective treatment and prevent recurrence.

Question 3: What is the most effective medical treatment for this disease?
A. Initial high dose parenteral penicillin G, followed by high dose oral penicillin V
B. Metronidazole
C. Liposomal amphotericin B
D. Long-term oral fluoroquinolone therapy
E. Rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol

Answers:
A. Initial high dose parenteral penicillin G, followed by high dose oral penicillin V – Correct. Actinomyces are non–spore-forming, anaerobic Gram positive bacteria. Long-term intensive antibiotic therapy is the mainstay of treatment for actinomycosis. Actinomyces species have traditionally shown exquisite sensitivity to penicillin; however, prolonged treatment is necessary due to poor antibiotic penetration of the thick-walled masses and sulfur granules. This typically entails 2 to 6 weeks of initial parenteral antibiotics followed by oral antibiotics for 6 to 12 months. Severe disease may require surgical management.
B. Metronidazole – Incorrect. Metronidazole should not be used to treat actinomycotic infections without added antimicrobial agents as it is not active against pathogenic actinomycetes.
C. Liposomal amphotericin B – Incorrect. Although it may sound like one, actinomycosis is not a fungal infection. Liposomal amphotericin B is the treatment of choice for mucormycosis.
D. Long-term oral fluoroquinolone therapy – Incorrect. In vitro data suggest that fluoroquinolones should be avoided in actinomycosis. Other antibiotics that should be avoided include oxacillin, dicloxacillin, cephalexin, metronidazole, and aminoglycosides.
E. Rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol – Incorrect. This combination of antibiotics is the treatment of choice for tuberculosis.

Question 3: Which of the following would be an appropriate treatment option for this patient?
A. Sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim and amikacin
B. Itraconazole
C. Penicillin G
D. Ketoconazole
E. Amphotericin B

Answers:
A. Sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim and amikacin – Correct. Sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim and dapsone for 2 to 3 years comprise the first-line therapeutic regimen for the 4 most common pathogens underlying actinomycotic mycetoma.
B. Itraconazole – Incorrect. Itraconazole is the first-line medical treatment for eumycetoma. This therapy is not curative but reduces disease burden in preparation for surgery.
C. Penicillin G – Incorrect. Penicillin G plays no role in the major treatment regimens of actinomycetoma. Penicillin G is indicated in the treatment of Actinomyces rather than Actinomadura.
D. Ketoconazole – Incorrect. Ketoconazole has been used in the treatment of eumycetoma but is no longer recommended because of hepatotoxicity associated with systemic administration.
E. Amphotericin B – Incorrect. Amphotericin B was historically used in the treatment of eumycetoma but is no longer recommended because of toxicity and high relapse rates.

### Doxycycline (doxycycline hyclate) [^0bb9c80d]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Chancroid caused by Haemophilus ducreyi.
Plague due to Yersinia pestis.
Tularemia due to Francisella tularensis.
Cholera caused by Vibrio cholerae.
Campylobacter fetus infections caused by Campylobacter fetus.
Brucellosis due to Brucella species (in conjunction with streptomycin).
Bartonellosis due to Bartonella bacilliformis.
Granuloma inguinale caused by Klebsiella granulomatis.

Because many strains of the following groups of microorganisms have been shown to be resistant to doxycycline, culture and susceptibility testing are recommended.

Doxycycline is indicated for treatment of infections caused by the following gram-negative bacteria, when bacteriologic testing indicates appropriate susceptibility to the drug:

Escherichia coli.
Enterobacter aerogenes.
Shigella species.
Acinetobacter species.
Respiratory tract infections caused by Haemophilus influenzae.
Respiratory tract and urinary tract infections caused by Klebsiella species.

Doxycycline is indicated for treatment of infections caused by the following gram-positive microorganisms when bacteriologic testing indicates appropriate susceptibility to the drug:

Upper respiratory infections caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae.
Anthrax due to Bacillus anthracis, including inhalational anthrax (post-exposure): to reduce the incidence or progression of disease following exposure to aerosolized Bacillus anthracis.

When penicillin is contraindicated, doxycycline is an alternative drug in the treatment of the following infections:

Uncomplicated gonorrhea caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae.
Syphilis caused by Treponema pallidum.
Yaws caused by Treponema pallidum subspecies pertenu e.
Listeriosis due to Listeria monocytogenes.
Vincent's infection caused by Fusobacterium fusiforme.
Actinomycosis caused by Actinomyces israelii.
Infections caused by Clostridium species.

In acute intestinal amebiasis, doxycycline may be a useful adjunct to amebicides.

In severe acne, doxycycline may be useful adjunctive therapy.

Prophylaxis: Doxycycline is indicated for the prophylaxis of malaria due to Plasmodium falciparum in short-term travelers (< 4 months) to areas with chloroquine and/or pyrimethamine-sulfadoxine resistant strains (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION section and Information for Patients subsection of the PRECAUTIONS section).

### Primary mammary actinomycosis challenged with penicillin allergy [^67194cc0]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Actinomycosis is a subacute-to-chronic bacterial infection caused by gram-positive, filamentous, non-acid-fast, facultative anaerobic bacteria. It is a normal commensal bacterium found in the oral cavity and the lower reproductive tract of women. We present a case of primary actinomycosis of the breast. A postmenopausal woman, complicated by penicillin allergy, presented with a left breast lump clinically simulating malignancy. The first line of treatment for actinomycosis is penicillin. Due to a penicillin allergy, the patient was initially treated with doxycycline. However, doxycycline was discontinued due to tremors, and was replaced by clindamycin. The patient had a good clinical response with resolution of the abscess.

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^e674ee33]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) in most adults — initial antibiotic and duration: If a decision is made to treat ABRS with an antibiotic agent, the clinician should prescribe amoxicillin with or without clavulanate as first-line therapy for 5–7 days for most adults. This is a Recommendation based on randomized controlled trials with heterogeneity and noninferiority design, with Aggregate evidence quality: Grade A and Level of Confidence in Evidence: Moderate. Benefits-harms assessment indicates a preponderance of benefit over harm, while risks include potential increased gastrointestinal adverse effects with amoxicillin-clavulanate and adverse effects from penicillin allergy. Exceptions include patients with penicillin allergy for whom amoxicillin is contraindicated. Intentional vagueness states that whether to prescribe amoxicillin or amoxicillin-clavulanate is at the clinician's discretion and that "most" adults are recommended 5 days of therapy, although a longer course may be appropriate for more severe illness or persistent symptoms beyond the initial 5 days. Role of patient preferences is moderate for shared decision making and large for determining duration since adverse events are reduced with shorter duration of therapy.

### Chronic madura foot: mycetoma and / orspp or actinomycosis [^66e71dd2]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Due to its often-slow progression, many cases present as chronic pathologies as they initially cause no impairment to function. However, as the mycetoma infection progresses, invasion into deeper structures accompanied by increasing visual or functional impairment often initiates patients to seek medical advice. Since phenotypic identification of the causative bacteria/fungi is often difficult using conventional microbiology, tissue or bone biopsies are better evaluated using either MALDI-TOF or molecular (DNA sequencing) methods if accessible. In addition, histopathology may augment these techniques. Imaging modalities such as MRI or CT often augment both the clinical picture and microbiology work-ups. Importantly, they may help to ascertain the extent of invasion, involvement with other tissue, nervous and vasculature structures in readiness for preoperative planning. Full excision of any infected tissues may not be possible as demonstrated in this case study, yet even in the absence of surgery, anti-infective regimens are often prolonged because of the tendency of Actinomyces spp or eumycetoma to recur.

A treatment algorithm for actinomycosis has been described by Schneider and Moos. For extensive lesions/soft tissue mass/abscess, surgical excision is required. Eradication or debulking will assist in the reduced requirement for prolonged anti-infective treatments. The first-line agents of choice for Actinomyces are penicillin or amoxicillin. Primary options include benzylpenicillin 6–12 g/day intravenously given in divided doses every 4–6 hours for 4–6 weeks, followed by phenoxymethylpenicillin 2–4 g/day orally given in 4–6 divided doses for 3–6 months after cessation of intravenous therapy. Alternatively, ampicillin 50 mg/kg/day intravenously given in divided doses every 8 hours for 4–6 weeks, followed by amoxicillin 500 mg orally three times daily for 3–6 months. Where penicillin allergies exist, ceftriaxone, clindamycin, erythromycin or doxycycline can be used. Eumycetoma (fungal) infections require similar long-duration regimens with antifungal therapies that include itraconazole, voriconazole or posaconazole. Regardless of the anti-infective, practices should be in keeping with good antimicrobial stewardship, hence infectious disease physicians form an integral team member.

### Pulmonary actinomycosis: the great masquerader [^8c188c7c]. BMJ Case Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Actinomycosis is a rare but treatable disease. Thoracic manifestations are varied and can mimic malignancy or tuberculosis. We report the case of a 54-year-old man who presented with a persistent cough and radiological evidence of right upper lobe lung mass. Conventional computed tomography guided biopsy and bronchoscopy proved to be non-diagnostic. Thoracotomy and histopathologic examination of the tissue confirmed actinomycosis infection. Excellent clinical and radiologic responses were noted following treatment with penicillin V. Despite a high clinical suspicion, the diagnosis can prove to be challenging.

### A rare case of ascending colon actinomycosis mimicking cancer [^d682beeb]. BMC Gastroenterology (2005). Low credibility.

Goldwag et al suggest that CT guided fine needle aspiration can be both diagnostic and therapeutic. Microbiological analysis of material acquired by FNA may reveal sulfur granules, which are suggesting actinomycosis and nocardiosis. In most of the cases the sample receive is difficult especially when intestinal and colon are involved. We believe that in cases where the CT findings are non-specific, surgical exploration is necessary not only for diagnostic but also for therapeutic reasons.

High dose intravenous penicillin injection followed by orally administered penicillin for at least 6–12 months is the treatment of choice. Penicillin administration decreases morbidity and the patient may avoid an unnecessary operation.

Correct diagnosis is difficult and can be achieved preoperatively in only 10% of the cases, but it is of great importance because the appropriate treatment includes primarily penicillin administration. Surgical intervention is indicated only in cases with obscure diagnosis and for necrotic debridement removal. Although diagnosis only with imaging techniques and laboratory tests is difficult, abdominal actinomycosis should always be included in the differential diagnosis in patients with abdominal masses.

### An overview of thoracic actinomycosis: CT features [^f0c81b72]. Insights Into Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

Detection of 'sulphur' granules by gram or histologic staining is the principal method of direct detection of Actinomyces. Histopathology reveals an acute inflammation surrounded by fibrosing granulation tissue. This material contains sulphur granules, colonies of organisms forming an amorphous centre surrounded by a rosette of clubbed filaments. Direct bacterial confirmation by culture is difficult because of inadequate anaerobic culture, prior antibiotic therapy or overgrowth of concomitant organisms. Thus, culture of expectorated sputum or bronchoscopy aspirates are usually not successful, while fine-needle aspiration, transbronchial biopsy and computed tomography or ultrasound-guided biopsies lead to accurate diagnoses.

The clinical manifestation of the disease has changed to a less aggressive form compared to the pre-antibiotic era. The usual presentation is now an indolent, slowly progressive pneumonia with fever, weight loss, cough, sputum and chest pain. The symptoms and clinical and radiologic signs mimic malignancy or tuberculosis. If the disease progresses to the proximal airway and vessels, life-threatening complications such as massive haemoptysis or bronchoesophageal fistula may occur. The course of the disease depends largely on adequate and early antibiotic therapy. The principal treatment of actinomycosis is long-term use of high-dose intravenous penicillin. However, many recent studies have reported that the short-term treatment is successful and that the traditional intensive, long-term regimen is not necessary. In the setting of abscess, percutaneous drainage in combination with medical therapy may be an option. Surgical resection may be a valid option for patients who do not respond to antibiotics for up to 12 weeks according to a recent study.

An awareness of the typical imaging findings of thoracic actinomycosis helps in making an early diagnosis, preventing fatal complications and unwarranted surgery. This pictorial essay reviews the radiological type of thoracic actinomycosis.

### Optimal duration of IV and oral antibiotics in the treatment of thoracic actinomycosis [^04d50b47]. Chest (2005). Low credibility.

Study Objective

IV antibiotic therapy for 2 to 6 weeks followed by 6 to 12 months of oral antibiotic therapy is usually recommended for the treatment of thoracic actinomycosis. The objective of this study was to evaluate the duration of IV and oral antibiotic therapy for thoracic actinomycosis.

Methods

We present a retrospective case series of 28 patients with thoracic actinomycosis as confirmed by histopathology from October 1994 through December 2003.

Results

After diagnosis of actinomycosis, 54% (15 of 28 patients) received antibiotic therapy alone. The duration of IV antibiotic therapy ranged from 0 to 18 days (median, 2 days; interquartile range [IQR], 0 to 3 days), and the duration of oral antibiotic treatment ranged from 76 to 412 days (median, 167 days; IQR, 142 to 214 days) in patients who received antibiotics alone. Combination surgical and antibiotic therapy occurred in 46% (13 of 28 patients). The duration of IV antibiotic therapy ranged from 3 to 17 days (median, 8 days; IQR, 5 to 13 days), and the duration of oral antibiotic therapy ranged from 0 to 534 days (median, 150 days; IQR, 3.5 to 289 days) in these patients. Clinical cures were achieved in 96% (27 of 28 patients). There was no clinical evidence of recurrence during follow-up period at our hospital (median, 23 months; IQR, 9 to 44 months) in 21 patients, excluding 7 patients who were transferred to referring hospitals after completion of antibiotic therapy (n = 6) or during antibiotic therapy (n = 1).

Conclusions

Thoracic actinomycosis is best treated with individualized therapeutic modalities, depending on factors such as the initial burden of disease, the performance of resectional surgery, and the clinical and radiologic responses to therapy. The traditional recommendation of IV antibiotic therapy for 2 to 6 weeks followed by oral antibiotic therapy for 6 to 12 months is not always necessary for all thoracic actinomycosis patients.

### Successful antimicrobial therapy of esophageal stenosis because of actinomycosis [^30883b9e]. Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Esophageal stenosis can cause vomiting or dysphagia in children and is commonly treated with esophageal balloon dilation. However, surgery may be required if the stenosis does not respond to dilation. Although esophageal actinomycosis can cause severe esophageal strictures and be refractory to balloon dilation, it has been reported to respond effectively to antimicrobial therapy in adults. However, the course of the disease and appropriate treatment strategies in children are not well understood. We present a case of a previously healthy 2-year-old boy diagnosed with esophageal stenosis because of actinomycosis. The patient was treated with intravenous penicillin G, followed by oral amoxicillin for 8 weeks and 6 months, respectively. After completion of the antimicrobial treatment, the patient showed improvement in symptoms and endoscopic findings. At the 1-year follow-up, the patient showed consistent weight gain and normal growth without further intervention. This case highlights the importance of considering esophageal actinomycosis as a potential cause of esophageal stenosis in children and the potential effectiveness of antimicrobial therapy in avoiding surgical intervention.

Penicillin allergy is one of the most commonly reported drug allergies, with a prevalence of 5% to 10%, and the reported prevalence is higher among hospitalized patients, at 11% to 15%. Individuals with a history of penicillin hypersensitivity are more likely to receive alternative antibiotic therapy, which can lead to added expense.

Tularemia — diagnosis and treatment recommendations state that serologic tests are the preferred method of diagnosing tularemia (weak, low). For severe cases, streptomycin (15 mg/kg every 12 hours IM) or gentamicin (1.5 mg/kg every 8 hours IV) is recommended (strong, low). For mild cases, tetracycline (500 mg qid) or doxycycline (100 mg bid given by mouth) is recommended (strong, low). Notify the microbiology laboratory if tularemia is suspected (strong, high). Routine cultures are often negative unless cysteine-supplemented media are utilized, the laboratory should be notified because of health risks to personnel, and unsuspected growth of F. tularensis can cause laboratory-acquired disease. No prospective controlled or randomized trials of therapy have been performed and the optimal duration is not established; Francisella is resistant to most β-lactam antibiotics, which should be avoided. When static drugs such as tetracyclines or chloramphenicol are used, relapses may be more common, often after brief therapy (ie, < 7–10 days). For adults, streptomycin dosing can be 30 mg/kg/day in 2 divided doses (no more than 2 g daily) or gentamicin 1.5 mg/kg every 8 hours.

### Oxytetracycline hydrochloride (Terramycin) [^8e10b215]. FDA (2005). Low credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Adults: Usual daily dose, 1–2 g divided in four equal doses, depending on the severity of the infection.

For children above eight years of age: Usual daily dose, 10–20 mg per pound (25–50 mg/kg) of body weight divided in four equal doses.

Therapy should be continued for at least 24–48 hours after symptoms and fever have subsided.

For treatment of brucellosis, 500 mg oxytetracycline four times daily for 3 weeks should be accompanied by streptomycin, 1 gram intramuscularly twice daily the first week, and once daily the second week.

For treatment of uncomplicated gonorrhea, when penicillin is contraindicated, tetracycline may be used for the treatment of both males and females in the following divided dosage schedule: 1.5 grams initially followed by 0.5 gram q.i.d. for a total of 9.0 grams.

For treatment of syphilis, a total of 30–40 grams in equally divided doses over a period of 10–15 days should be given. Close follow-up, including laboratory tests, is recommended.

Administration of adequate amounts of fluid along with capsule and tablet forms of drugs in the tetracycline class is recommended to wash down the drugs and reduce the risk of esophageal irritation and ulceration. (See ADVERSE REACTIONS .)

Concomitant therapy: Antacids containing aluminum, calcium, or magnesium impair absorption and should not be given to patients taking oral tetracyclines.

Food and some dairy products also interfere with absorption. Oral forms of tetracyclines should be given 1 hour before or 2 hours after meals. Pediatric oral dosage forms should not be given with milk formulas and should be given at least 1 hour prior to feeding.

In patients with renal impairment (See WARNINGS .) Total dosage should be decreased by reduction of recommended individual doses and/or by extending time intervals between doses.

In the treatment of streptococcal infections, a therapeutic dose of oxytetracycline should be administered for at least 10 days.

### Primary actinomycotic osteomyelitis of metacarpal bones managed successfully with surgical debridement and Welsh regimen [^eb4b7abc]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

Mycetoma of the hand is a chronic granulomatous disease seen in the tropics and subtropical regions, mainly affecting the skin and subcutaneous tissue of the foot. Primary actinomycotic osteomyelitis involving the metacarpals is rarely reported in the literature. The conventional treatment for actinomycosis has been high-dose penicillin. We report a case of chronic osteomyelitis in the metacarpals of the hand caused by actinomycetes in a woman in her 40s. She underwent surgical intervention in the form of wound debridement and curettage, followed by a 6-month course of Welsh regimen after a biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of actinomycotic osteomyelitis. This case report underscores the importance of recognising primary actinomycosis as a potential cause of chronic osteomyelitis at unusual sites and highlights the efficacy of combined surgical debridement, biopsy and adequate antibiotic management in consultation with infectious disease specialists in achieving good outcomes.

### Centers for disease control and prevention expert panel meetings on prevention and treatment of anthrax in adults [^1184435d]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Treatment for Cutaneous Anthrax without Systemic Involvement

Uncomplicated cutaneous anthrax has been successfully treated with a single oral antimicrobial drug (Technical Appendix Table 5). Oral fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, and moxifloxacin) and doxycycline are equivalent first-line agents. Clindamycin is an alternative option if fluoroquinolones and doxycycline are contraindicated or unavailable. Given the long history of successful treatment of localized uncomplicated cutaneous anthrax with penicillin, amoxicillin and penicillin VK are also alternative therapeutic options if the isolate is known to be susceptible to penicillin. However, adequate dosages must be used because of the potential for development of drug resistance during treatment with subtherapeutic dosing.

Duration of treatment for localized or uncomplicated cutaneous disease depends on the B. anthracis exposure source. If naturally acquired (e.g. animals with anthrax, products such as hides from animals with anthrax), a 7–10-day course of antimicrobial drugs is sufficient. If bioterrorism-related exposure or an aerosol exposure is suspected, the recommendation is the same as that for PEP (Technical Appendix Table 2) because the patient is likely to have also inhaled spores.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Acquired syphilis — children and adolescents is treated with a single dose of benzathine penicillin G 50,000 units/kg body weight IM (up to the adult dose of 2.4 million units) for early-stage disease (i.e., primary, secondary, and early latent disease) (AII). For late latent disease, three doses of benzathine penicillin G 50,000 units/kg body weight (up to the adult dose of 2.4 million units) should be administered IM once weekly for 3 doses (total 150,000 units/kg body weight, up to the adult total dose of 7.2 million units) (AIII). Alternative therapies (e.g., ceftriaxone, azithromycin) should be administered to HIV-infected patients only when treatment with penicillin is not feasible, and with close clinical and serologic monitoring because data on their use are limited (BII). Neurosyphilis should be treated with aqueous penicillin G 200,000 to 300,000 units/kg body weight per dose IV every 4 to 6 hours (maximum dosage: 18–24 million units/day) for 10 to 14 days (AII).

### Actinomycosis of the pharynx [^a22b55ca]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Few cases of pharyngeal actinomycosis have been documented in the literature. We describe the case of a 67-year-old white man who presented with symptoms of dysphagia. Laryngoscopy revealed a pedunculated mass in the left posterior pharyngeal wall; an excisional biopsy confirmed the diagnosis. Postoperatively, the patient underwent 10 weeks of intravenous penicillin therapy followed by 4 months of oral antibiotics, and his condition resolved. We discuss the diagnosis, management, and complications of this rare infection.

### Pulse therapy with 5-FU in eradicating actinic keratoses with less than recommended dosage [^bc1ecbd3]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2002). Low credibility.

Pulse therapy has been used for many years, but rarely in a clinical setting. This article describes a clinical study designed to determine the efficacy of pulse therapy with 5-FU for patients with multiple actinic keratoses. The results indicated that pulse therapy was indeed effective in eradicating most of the actinic keratoses while causing less discomfort or disfigurement than the FDA recommended dose, especially for patients with less severe and milder forms of actinic keratoses.

### Paranasal sinus actinomycosis treated with a combination of surgery and long-term low-dose macrolide [^ac95fe5f]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Actinomycosis is a bacterial infection caused by actinomyces. Although almost 50% of cases are related to the head and neck region, those in the nose and paranasal sinuses (PNS) are rare. Actinomycosis of the PNS is presumed to be typically caused by dental caries, dental manipulation, and maxillofacial trauma, which facilitate the penetration of oral pathogens into the sinus, and should thus be treated by the combination of surgical removal and potent antibiotics for at least two months. The current use of these antibiotics might be redundant, considering the nature of actinomycosis of the PNS, which does not invade the mucosal surface. We herein report a 67-year-old female treated with endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) and diagnosed with actinomycosis of the PNS by pathological findings. She had no history of dental impairment or treatment. She was given routine perioperative prophylactic antibiotics (cefazolin) during the surgery, followed by low-dose clarithromycin. The mucosa of the PNS normalized without any discharge by three months after the operation. The patient is a valuable example that should prompt reconsideration of the commonly accepted pathogenesis and treatment of actinomycosis of the PNS.

### Pulmonary actinomycosis and Hodgkin's disease: when FDG-PET may be misleading [^8dc1feb4]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

We present a patient with advanced Hodgkin's disease treated with escalated BEACOPP chemotherapy. The result from the interim fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography with CT (PET-CT) after two cycles of chemotherapy is crucial for treatment guidance for the clinical trial HD18 from the German Hodgkin Study Group. An increase in size and standard uptake value (SUV) of a pulmonary lesion suggesting refractory Hodgkin's disease was documented. Since all other manifestations of the lymphoma responded well to the treatment, the discordant behaviour was suspicious for another reason for this progressive pulmonary lesion. Bronchoscopy revealed Actinomyces species in cultures from bronchial washings. Specific treatment was initiated and consisted of 2 weeks of intravenous penicillin followed by ceftriaxone intravenous for another 4 weeks and subsequent oral amoxicillin to complete 12 months of antibiotic therapy. For the Hodgkin's lymphoma, complete remission was documented after a total of six cycles of escalated BEACOPP.

Upper respiratory tract infections caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae.

Skin and skin structure infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus (Note: Minocycline is not the drug of choice in the treatment of any type of staphylococcal infection.)

When penicillin is contraindicated, minocycline is an alternative drug in the treatment of the following infections:

Meningitis due to Neisseria meningitidis.

Syphilis caused by Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum.

Yaws caused by Treponema pallidum subspecies pertenue.

Listeriosis due to Listeria monocytogenes.

In severe acne, minocycline may be useful adjunctive therapy.

Oral minocycline is indicated in the treatment of asymptomatic carriers of Neisseria meningitidis to eliminate meningococci from the nasopharynx. In order to preserve the usefulness of minocycline in the treatment of asymptomatic meningococcal carriers, diagnostic laboratory procedures, including serotyping and susceptibility testing, should be performed to establish the carrier state and the correct treatment. It is recommended that the prophylactic use of minocycline be reserved for situations in which the risk of meningococcal meningitis is high.

Oral minocycline is not indicated for the treatment of meningococcal infection.

Although no controlled clinical efficacy studies have been conducted, limited clinical data show that oral minocycline hydrochloride has been used successfully in the treatment of infections caused by Mycobacterium marinum.

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of minocycline hydrochloride capsules and other antibacterial drugs, minocycline hydrochloride capsules should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy.

### Endobronchial actinomycosis: successful treatment with oral antibiotics [^96e32a15]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

This is a case report of an 84-year-old lady who presented with haemoptysis, weight loss and a right hilar mass on chest radiograph. CT scan of the chest revealed complete proximal occlusion of the right upper lobe from an endobronchial lesion consistent with a tumour. The patient was initially reluctant to undergo fibreoptic bronchoscopy as she was deemed to be unsuitable for any curative treatment of lung carcinoma. Bronchoscopy showed an exophytic necrotic tumour within the right upper lobe. Biopsies showed many bacterial colonies consistent with actinomyces and a diagnosis of endobronchial actinomycosis was made. Owing to multiple antibiotic allergies and patient refusal to have intravenous antibiotics, she was started on a course of doxycycline 200 mg once daily. There was near complete improvement in symptoms and radiographic appearances by the end of 4 months. This case highlights the importance of confirmatory diagnosis in the elderly as curable conditions are otherwise missed.

### Actinomycosis arising from the nasal cavity, with rare fatal progression [^e63af708]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

Actinomycosis is a common treatable disease caused by Actinomyces, and generally has a good prognosis. However, we report a fatal case of actinomycosis of the nasal cavity. A 54-year-old man, reporting of left nasal obstruction, swelling and sharp pain around the root of the nose, was referred to our hospital. Histopathological examinations led to a definitive diagnosis of actinomycosis, and oral antibiotics were administered in an outpatient setting. However, the patient discontinued follow-up at the outpatient clinic because of the adverse effects of intravenous delivery, and poor compliance with oral antibiotic therapy led to him receiving a less than adequate dose. Thus, in the absence of sufficient antibiotic treatment, necrosis gradually progressed in the lesion, and the patient died of multiple organ failure and disseminated intravascular coagulation caused by local infection.

Background information about coccidioidomycosis — organism biology and early pulmonary infection are summarized as follows: Coccidioides species are dimorphic fungi that cause coccidioidomycosis, growing in the environment as mycelia that produce single-cell arthroconidia and, after mammalian infection, transforming into spherules that revert back to mycelial growth if cultured. Virtually all coccidioidal infections are initiated by inhalation of an arthroconidium, and the most common initial syndrome is that of a respiratory illness.

### Childhood thoracic actinomycosis: case report [^42a7bf23]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Actinomycosis is a rare bacterial infection. It has a pseudotumoral appearance when localized to the lungs or mediastinum. The diagnosis is often delayed because clinical presentation is nonspecific, bacteriologic diagnosis is difficult, and culture growth is slow. The diagnosis is mainly based upon histologic identification of actinomycotic sulfur granules. Actinomycosis is usually sensitive to penicillin G. Surgical treatment is reserved for failure of medical treatment and complications. We report a case of thoracic actinomycosis in a 13-year-old boy.

### A de-escalated treatment strategy in the management of paediatric cervicofacial actinomycosis [^0c393b5b]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Actinomycosis is a rare invasive bacterial disease that is characterised by granulomatous inflammation often mistaken as malignancy. Traditionally, this has been managed with prolonged courses of antibiotics with durations up to 6–12 months. Surgical intervention as an adjuvant treatment has been shown to reduce the length of antibiotic treatment significantly to 4 weeks. We report a case of cervicofacial actinomycosis in a 12-year-old girl who was adequately treated with an 11-day course of antibiotics without surgical intervention and shows no signs of recurrence at 6 months post-treatment.

### Pulmonary actinomycosis [^c2e58e05]. The European Respiratory Journal (2003). Low credibility.

Pulmonary actinomycosis is a rare but important and challenging diagnosis to make. Even when the clinical suspicion is high, the disease is commonly confused with other chronic suppurative lung diseases and with malignancy. An early, accurate diagnosis will prevent the considerable psychological and physical morbidity, including unwarranted surgery, associated with delayed diagnosis. The clinical, radiological and therapeutic characteristics of the infection are reviewed here. Respiratory physicians should be aware of this important differential when investigating patients for persistent pulmonary shadowing. This will expedite the diagnosis of an otherwise highly treatable condition with an excellent prognosis if picked up early.
