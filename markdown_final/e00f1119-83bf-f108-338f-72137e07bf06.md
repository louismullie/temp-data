## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking why François Quesnay and the Physiocrats argued that agriculture is the source of all wealth, and which answer choice best reflects their reasoning. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the historical context and who the Physiocrats were. Then, I should verify their core economic theory and the concept of the "net product". Next, I will examine why they excluded manufacturing and trade from being true sources of new wealth. After that, I should review the provided options and eliminate those that conflict with Physiocratic doctrine. Finally, I will select the best answer and double-check that it aligns with their logic and timing relative to Adam Smith.

> Let me first confirm the historical context. The Physiocrats were 18th-century French economists who believed that economic activity should be modeled on natural laws, and they emphasized agriculture as the foundation of wealth. Their key figure, François Quesnay, developed the Tableau économique to illustrate how wealth circulated, with agriculture producing a surplus that sustained the rest of the economy. This predates Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations by roughly two decades, which helps frame why their view seems distinct from later classical economics [^notfound].

> Now, I need to verify their core theory. The Physiocrats argued that only agriculture yields a "net product" (produit net) — a surplus over costs — because nature itself adds value in the form of increased biomass and usable output. Manufacturing and commerce, by contrast, were seen as "sterile" in that they merely transformed or exchanged existing wealth without creating a new surplus. This is why they concluded that agriculture is the only sector that truly generates new wealth, whereas other activities only redistribute or modify it [^notfound].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about alternatives. I should review why they excluded other sectors. Manufacturing was considered sterile because it only changed the form of materials without adding net value, and trade was viewed as exchanging existing goods rather than creating new wealth. This is a key distinction from later thinkers like Smith, who recognized value creation in labor and capital across sectors, but the Physiocrats' framework was anchored in the idea that only land and nature could yield a genuine surplus [^notfound].

> Next, I should examine the answer choices carefully. Options A, B, C, D, E, F, G, I, and J all attribute wealth to sources other than agriculture — finance, labor, culture, commerce, policy, industry, mining, technology, or trade — which directly contradicts the Physiocratic claim that agriculture is the unique source of new wealth. The only option that matches their doctrine is H, which states that agriculture is the only possible source of new wealth, reflecting their net product theory and the sterility of non-agricultural sectors [^notfound].

> Wait, let me verify the timing relative to Adam Smith, because that often trips people up. The Physiocrats' emphasis on agriculture as the sole creator of new wealth indeed predates Smith's broader labor theory of value and his recognition of manufacturing and trade as productive, which reinforces why contemporary readers might find their view narrow. But historically, their position was coherent within their own analytical framework centered on land and natural productivity [^notfound].

> I should double-check that I'm not overstating their exclusion of other activities. While the Physiocrats acknowledged that artisans, merchants, and manufacturers were necessary, they insisted these activities did not add to the total stock of wealth in the way agriculture did. This nuance matters because it explains why they prioritized agricultural policy, tax reform, and free trade in grain, even as they downplayed the wealth-creating role of industry and commerce [^notfound].

> Final answer: H. Agriculture is the only possible source of new wealth. This choice accurately reflects the Physiocratic doctrine that only agriculture produces a net surplus (produit net) through natural productivity, whereas manufacturing, trade, and other sectors are "sterile" and merely transform or exchange existing wealth without creating new value [^notfound].

---

The Physiocrats argued that agriculture is the only source of new wealth because it alone produces a **net surplus** (produit net) — output exceeding inputs — through natural productivity, whereas manufacturing and trade merely transform or exchange existing wealth without creating new value. This view reflects their belief that only land and nature generate a **true surplus**, making agriculture the foundation of economic growth and the basis for taxation and policy.

---

## The Physiocratic doctrine of agricultural surplus

Central to Physiocratic thought is the concept of the **produit net**, the net surplus generated by agriculture after deducting production costs (seed, labor, and capital). Quesnay and his followers argued that this surplus is the only true source of new wealth because it arises from the natural productivity of the land, which yields more than is invested. In contrast, manufacturing and trade were considered "sterile" because they merely transform or exchange existing goods without adding new value.

---

## The role of nature in wealth creation

The Physiocrats emphasized that agriculture harnesses natural processes — photosynthesis, soil fertility, and seasonal cycles — to produce a **surplus beyond human inputs**. This natural productivity is the unique source of new wealth, as it generates output that exceeds the sum of inputs. Manufacturing and trade, while useful, do not create new wealth; they only modify or redistribute existing wealth.

---

## Comparison with other economic activities

The Physiocrats explicitly contrasted agriculture with other economic activities:

| **Economic activity** | **Role in wealth creation according to physiocrats** |
|-|-|
| Agriculture | - Only source of new wealth <br/> - Produces net surplus through natural productivity |
| Manufacturing | - Sterile <br/> - Transforms existing materials without creating new wealth |
| Trade | - Sterile <br/> - Exchanges existing goods without creating new wealth |

---

This distinction underscores their belief that only agriculture yields a **net surplus**, while manufacturing and trade are merely intermediary or redistributive.

---

## Influence on economic policy

The Physiocrats' emphasis on agriculture shaped their policy recommendations: they advocated for **minimal government intervention**, free trade in agricultural products, and a **single tax on land rent** (the source of the net surplus). They believed that taxing agriculture would capture the true surplus without stifling production, whereas taxing manufacturing or trade would merely hinder the redistribution of existing wealth.

---

## Critiques and limitations

While the Physiocratic theory was influential, it faced criticism for **undervaluing manufacturing and trade**, which also contribute to economic growth through innovation, efficiency gains, and market expansion. Adam Smith and later classical economists challenged the notion that only agriculture produces new wealth, arguing that labor and capital across sectors can generate value and increase societal wealth.

---

## Conclusion

The Physiocrats argued that agriculture is the only source of new wealth because it alone produces a **net surplus** through natural productivity. Manufacturing and trade, in their view, merely transform or exchange existing wealth without creating new value. This perspective highlights the historical importance of agriculture in economic thought and informs contemporary discussions on sustainable development and resource management.

This article argues that public health researchers have often ignored the analysis of wealth in the quest to understand the social determinants of health. Wealth concentration and the inequities in wealth between and within countries are increasing. Despite this scare accurate data are available to assist the analysis of the health impact of this trend. Improved data collection on wealth distribution should be encouraged. Epidemiologists and political economy of health researchers should pay more attention to understanding the dynamics of wealth and its consequences for population health. Policy research to underpin policies designed to reduce inequities in wealth distribution should be intensified.

### Assessment of mortality disparities by wealth relative to other measures of socioeconomic status among US adults [^83d0a046]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Discussion

There are many previous studies of wealth and mortality based on the Health and Retirement Survey,,,,,, but they are limited to US individuals older than 50 years, who may have already bought a home and begun accumulating wealth. We know of 2 other studies based on the Panel Study of Income Dynamics: the firstwas restricted to US individuals aged 45 years and older, and the seconddid not evaluate whether the association between wealth and mortality varies by age.

In this cohort study, MIDUS offers the opportunity to investigate the association between wealth and mortality among younger US individuals (ie, 36% of the sample was aged 40 years or younger at baseline). In this life stage, individuals are developing their career and starting to accumulate wealth. Although mortality rates remain low at these young ages, a report by the National Academy of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicineconcluded that increased mortality among working-age US individuals was the main reason for the 3-year consecutive decline in US life expectancy during 2015 to 2017. As they note, “Declining economic conditions tend to weaken societal institutions, community resources, family bonds, social networks, and access to health care—all of which could help explain disparities in working-age mortality according to race and ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and geography.”

The demographic-adjusted estimates quantify the magnitude of the mortality disparity associated with wealth, but that does not necessarily mean that wealth has a causal effect on longevity. A recent study concluded that, “policies to support individuals’ ability to accrue wealth and to achieve financial security in adulthood could have considerable health benefits.”That would be true only if wealth has a causal effect and is not merely a result of selection and the detrimental effect of illness on wealth. Nonetheless, even if the effect is not causal, Smith points out that, “Whatever the origins of this stratification, it has profound implications for population health, where the consequences are serious and where the core reasons remain a mystery.”

### Changes in household wealth over the process of widowhood across European countries [^cfddd39a]. The Journals of Gerontology: Series B, Psychological Sciences and Social Sciences (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Wealth and Its Components in Older Age

Although access to sufficient wealth is central to the economic well-being across the life course, it has particularly high relevance in older age (;). Especially following retirement, labor market income ceases, and wealth is vital to finance aspects of everyday life and maintain desired living standards. As such, the anticipation of retirement is one of the most central savings motives throughout the life course (;). Older adulthood is therefore a period where wealth tends to be consumed and is no longer accumulated further. In that regard, wealth shocks during older age, for example, resulting from marital dissolution, can have critical implications for the economic standing of surviving spouses but also their adult children.

Wealth is not singular but is comprised of various components, including, for instance, real estate, business ownership, stocks and bonds, savings, retirement accounts, life insurance, jewelry, cars, and collectables (;). Among the most important is housing wealth. For many older homeowners, their primary residence makes up by far the largest share of their wealth portfolio. Nonhousing wealth consists of not only financial assets but also the value of cars and businesses. Savings are the most common form of financial asset. However, many older adults also have investments in the form of stocks, bonds, and other financial instruments. While nonhousing wealth, specifically financial assets, can be easily liquidized to cover expected and unexpected costs, housing wealth has a function of its own and its liquidation is costly.

Wealth and Income Measures

The HRS calculates wealth at the household level as the sum of all assets minus the value of debts. Assets queried include the net value of primary and secondary residences; other real estate; vehicles; businesses; individual retirement and Keogh accounts; stocks; mutual funds; investment trusts; checking, savings, and money market accounts; certificates of deposit; government savings bonds; treasury bills; bonds; bond funds; and other savings. Debts queried include mortgages and land contracts on residences, home loans, and other debt.

For each wealth component, respondents are asked whether they own the given asset and, if so, its estimated value. If the respondent does not know the value, the interviewer uses an “unfolding brackets” technique, asking a series of questions about the value of the asset that becomes more specific based on the respondent’s answers. The HRS uses these answers and data from other study waves to impute the value of assets when necessary. Since 2002, the HRS has asked respondents to confirm or correct the value of wealth components.

Because costs associated with illness (eg, medical bills, lost wages) might depress income and wealth over time while also contributing to early mortality, we used figures for household income and wealth at study entry. Due to the highly skewed distribution of wealth, we analyzed wealth using deciles. All dollar figures were adjusted to 2018 US dollars using the Consumer Price Index.

Mortality

Our main outcome was survival conditional on entry into the HRS. The HRS derives the month and year of death from postmortem interviews with family members and the National Death Index.

### Greater post-neolithic wealth disparities in Eurasia than in north America and mesoamerica [^8aba9667]. Nature (2017). Excellent credibility.

How wealth is distributed among households provides insight into the fundamental characters of societies and the opportunities they afford for social mobility. However, economic inequality has been hard to study in ancient societies for which we do not have written records, which adds to the challenge of placing current wealth disparities into a long-term perspective. Although various archaeological proxies for wealth, such as burial goods or exotic or expensive-to-manufacture goods in household assemblages, have been proposed, the first is not clearly connected with households, and the second is confounded by abandonment mode and other factors. As a result, numerous questions remain concerning the growth of wealth disparities, including their connection to the development of domesticated plants and animals and to increases in sociopolitical scale. Here we show that wealth disparities generally increased with the domestication of plants and animals and with increased sociopolitical scale, using Gini coefficients computed over the single consistent proxy of house-size distributions. However, unexpected differences in the responses of societies to these factors in North America and Mesoamerica, and in Eurasia, became evident after the end of the Neolithic period. We argue that the generally higher wealth disparities identified in post-Neolithic Eurasia were initially due to the greater availability of large mammals that could be domesticated, because they allowed more profitable agricultural extensification, and also eventually led to the development of a mounted warrior elite able to expand polities (political units that cohere via identity, ability to mobilize resources, or governance) to sizes that were not possible in North America and Mesoamerica before the arrival of Europeans. We anticipate that this analysis will stimulate other work to enlarge this sample to include societies in South America, Africa, South Asia and Oceania that were under-sampled or not included in this study.

### The effect of rising food prices on food consumption: systematic review with meta-regression [^4df811ef]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

The relation between food prices and demand is stronger for all food groups in low income countries than in high income countries, indicating that increases in food prices are likely to have a disproportionately greater impact on food consumption in low income countries. Food prices also had a stronger impact on demand for food in lower income households within countries—a relation that has not been explored in previous reviews. Irrespective of national wealth category, the elasticities of dietary staples such as cereals and fats and oils were lower than those of animal source foods (meat, fish, and dairy), suggesting that in all settings, animal source foods represent luxury foods in the human diet. These estimates allow us for the first time to quantify the likely impact of global rises in food prices on demand for food in households and countries with different wealth profiles.

Applications of findings

This is the first review to quantify systematically the relation between food prices and demand for food worldwide, and the first to explore differences in this relation between household income groups. To demonstrate the value of the elasticities presented, we estimated the effect of price changes on presumed consumption (as estimated from Food and Agriculture Organization data on food availability). Food and Agriculture Organization food availability data are a proxy for national level food consumption that have been shown to correlate with other measures of food intake and health outcomes.Based on our predicted price elasticities, a 10% increase in the global price of cereals would reduce demand for cereals by 6.1% in low income countries and 4.3% in high income countries, equivalent to 301 kJ (72 kcal) and 167 kJ (40 kcal) reductions on average in cereal availability per person per day in low and high income countries, respectively. The estimated 75% greater reduction in low income countries in demand for cereals that often form the predominant part of the diet shows the unequal impacts of global changes in food prices. Our analysis also suggests that poorer people in low income countries will suffer the most and highlights that higher food prices may substantially increase their risks of undernutrition. For wealthy countries aiming to use taxes and subsidies beneficially to influence dietary patterns, the analyses suggest that compared with low income countries the influence of food prices on demand is attenuated and that household income will largely determine the effectiveness of such strategies at a population level.

Their economic behavior, influenced by diverse income sources such as labor, investments, and social benefits, shapes their consumption, savings decisions, and overall liquid wealth (W i, t). Actively engaging in both labor and goods markets, households make strategic consumption choices based on price and availability and adjust market relationships in response to demand fulfillment. This adaptive behavior not only reflects their individual economic circumstances but also contributes to the broader market dynamics, affecting the supply-demand equilibrium in the consumer goods and labor markets. At each time step t, households make decisions: (1) the amount of goods to consume and their suppliers, (2) their employer. The consumption amount depends on their wealth level W i, t, interpreting W i, t as liquid wealth excluding assets like real estate (as in). The wealth level adjusts through various income sources, with labor incomedefined as:where w i, t is the wage for L i labor units provided, and U B t are unemployment benefits. Total wealth for consumption at t is, where L A i, t is the liquid asset level. Households choose goods based on price and availability, adjusting market relationships in response to demand fulfillment. In case of unmet demand, they buy from other producers until no supply remains, avoiding high involuntary savings due to market mismatches. After transactions, they know their true consumption leveland liquid assets L A i, t +1 for the next period. Households may break trade connections with unsatisfactory suppliers (probability ψ Q) or seek lower prices (probability ψ P), applying pressure on producers to meet demand and reduce prices. Again, they are only bounded rational. In our case, this means, instead of analytically solving their explicit inter-temporal choice problem, they approximate it by comparing a finite set of actions (i.e. they lack the ability to compute perfect optima). These households have consumption and investment preferences, based on their wealth levels and heterogeneous time preferences. Each household i inter-temporal optimization problem is defined as:where α i is the absolute propensity to consume, as a portion of wealth level W i, t.is the household’s discount factor with j − t as index for current and future time steps, and U (⋅) is the utility function, given as. This optimization problem is constrained by:Here, Y i, t is the household’s income level at time t, which can come from labor, capital, or government subsidies. C i, t is the consumption level and r t the real interest rate. In order to solve the optimization problem in equation (2), households form expectations of their future income- and wealth level and the interest rate. These expectations are formed using simple adaptive updating rules:whereis the expected value and ω is a weighting factor. Based on the optimization problem, heterogeneous time preferences, and adjusting changing expectations, households have heterogeneous saving rates on both the cross-sectional and inter-temporal levels. Furthermore, these savings are precautionary, meaning that savings are motivated by the desire to keep a stable consumption level in case of a negative income shock. As a result, aggregate behavior qualitatively matches empirical data for the marginal propensity to consume, as shown in Fig. S7.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). Medium credibility.

ACC/AHA cost/value methodology—future directions identify limited evidence and modeling needs, noting “The primary barrier is the lack of high-quality data on cost and value (cost-effectiveness) of interventions or procedures used in practice,” that “modeling is often required to determine the benefit and cost of an intervention over the patient’s lifetime” and such evidence “can be added to future updates of guidelines and performance measures.” Regarding thresholds, the statement reports that “the WHO has recommended that this threshold be tied to the wealth of the country as defined by GDP per capita,” and, amid uncertainty, “we recommend the use of 2 thresholds initially: a lower threshold to identify an upper boundary for good value and a high threshold to identify poor value, with the remaining values considered intermediate.” Because cost changes can rapidly alter value, it states “if a medication becomes generic 1 year after a guideline is written, the value determination would no longer be accurate and may have changed from poor (low) to good (high),” reinforcing that “The ability to rapidly reassess value and subsequently update guideline recommendations will be important to accommodate changes in value over time.” On quality of life, it notes “Cost-effectiveness analysis makes the assumption that all QALYs are equivalent, but healthcare decision makers may favor interventions that benefit disadvantaged groups,” and “Decision makers must consider both equity and optimization of population health.” For performance measurement, the report states “low-value care generally should not be the basis of performance measures unless there are exceptional considerations regarding equity or other specific justifications” and that “Future performance measure documents may incorporate the cost of implementing the measures in addition to the value of the care,” aiming to advance quality “by including value information in guideline and performance measure recommendations.”

### Primate anterior insular cortex represents economic decision variables proposed by prospect theory [^4982aad0]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

In humans, risk attitude is highly context-dependent, varying with wealth levels or for different potential outcomes, such as gains or losses. These behavioral effects have been modelled using prospect theory, with the key assumption that humans represent the value of each available option asymmetrically as a gain or loss relative to a reference point. It remains unknown how these computations are implemented at the neuronal level. Here we show that macaques, like humans, change their risk attitude across wealth levels and gain/loss contexts using a token gambling task. Neurons in the anterior insular cortex (AIC) encode the 'reference point' (i.e., the current wealth level of the monkey) and reflect 'loss aversion' (i.e., option value signals are more sensitive to change in the loss than in the gain context) as postulated by prospect theory. In addition, changes in the activity of a subgroup of AIC neurons correlate with the inter-trial fluctuations in choice and risk attitude. Taken together, we show that the primate AIC in risky decision-making may be involved in monitoring contextual information used to guide the animal's willingness to accept risk.

### Primate anterior insular cortex represents economic decision variables proposed by prospect theory [^727306ca]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Uncertainty about the possible outcomes of chosen actions is a basic feature of all human and animal decision making. How our nervous system deals with this uncertainty is therefore a fundamental question in cognitive neuroscience. Decisions under uncertainty depend on an individual’s risk attitude, i.e. the willingness to accept uncertainty about the outcome (risk) in exchange for possibly better outcomes than a safer alternative. Risk attitude is strongly influenced by context. Humans show different risk attitudes when facing risky gains versus risky losses. The abundance of economic resources in the environment and the current wealth of subjects also modulate an individual’s risk attitude –. Prospect theory, the most influentialand wide-rangingdescriptive model of decision-making under risk, explains these context-dependent changes in risk attitude using two critical concepts about the cognitive processes underlying value estimation. First, prospect theory assumes that humans evaluate possible future outcomes either as gains or as losses relative to a reference point (i.e. the current wealth, resources, or state of the subject). Second, human’s sensitivities to changes in value are different for losses and gains. Specifically, humans are more sensitive to changes in value for losses as compared to gains (i.e. losses loom larger than gains). Thus, humans’ choices can be manipulated by framing an identical outcome as either a gain or loss using verbal instructions, and by varying the current wealth of subjects that change the point of reference. Despite the success of prospect theory as a descriptive model of risky choices, it remains unclear if its underlying assumptions match the framework for value estimation implemented on the neuronal level.

### ACC / AHA statement on cost / value methodology in clinical practice guidelines and performance measures: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on performance measures and task force on practice guidelines [^abb7af28]. Circulation (2014). Medium credibility.

ACC/AHA cost/value methodology—future directions emphasize that the primary barrier is the lack of high-quality data on cost and value (cost-effectiveness) of interventions or procedures used in practice, and that modeling is often required over the patient’s lifetime but such models are often limited owing to imprecise estimates of treatment effects, competing risks, and future costs of care. Regarding thresholds, the WHO has recommended that this threshold be tied to the wealth of the country as defined by GDP per capita, and given uncertainty the authors state we recommend the use of 2 thresholds initially: a lower threshold to identify an upper boundary for good value and a high threshold to identify poor value, with the remaining values considered intermediate. Value can change with costs; for example, if a medication becomes generic 1 year after a guideline is written, the value determination would no longer be accurate and may have changed from poor (low) to good (high). For performance measurement, incorporation of value assessments may have an immediate impact, as low-value care generally should not be the basis of performance measures unless there are exceptional considerations regarding equity or other specific justifications, and future performance measure documents may incorporate the cost of implementing the measures in addition to the value of the care. Quality-of-life considerations are highlighted, noting that a treatment that improves quality of life at a reasonable cost has some value even if it does not improve life expectancy, that cost-effectiveness analysis makes the assumption that all QALYs are equivalent but healthcare decision makers may favor interventions that benefit disadvantaged groups, and that decision makers must consider both equity and optimization of population health.

### Inequality in economic shock exposures across the global firm-level supply network [^00ff4814]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

For centuries, national economies have been engaging in international trade and production. The resulting international supply networks not only increase wealth for countries, but also allow for economic shocks to propagate across borders. Using global, firm-level supply network data, we estimate a country's exposure to direct and indirect economic losses caused by the failure of a company in another country. We show the network of international systemic risk-flows. We find that rich countries expose poor countries stronger to systemic risk than vice-versa. The risk is highly concentrated, however, higher risk levels are not compensated with a risk premium in GDP levels, nor higher GDP growth. Our findings put the often praised benefits for developing countries from globalized production in a new light, by relating them to risks involved in the production processes. Exposure risks present a new dimension of global inequality that most affects the poor in supply shock crises.

### Trends in flood losses in Europe over the past 150 years [^9625b619]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Results

Trends in exposure

Between 1870 and 2016, Europe experienced substantial growth in population (130%), urban area (more than 1000%), and wealth (more than 2000% constant prices). However, there has been large variability in patterns of development between regions. In 8% of European regions (NUTS 3), the total population in 2016 was lower than in 1870. Rural population across the continent declined, and fixed assets in agriculture barely changed in contrast with large increases in wealth in the housing, industry and services sectors (Supplementary Fig. 1). Most important for this study are relative trends within and outside of flood-prone areas. Since 1870, the percentage of population, GDP and wealth exposed to the 100-year flood has decreased slightly for river floods, but increased for coastal floods (Fig. 1). When analyzed at the continental scale, those trends are partly caused by the aforementioned rates of demographic and economic growth between regions (Supplementary Fig. 2). As the map in Fig. 1 shows, while overall exposure to floods has declined in most countries, especially those in central and northern Europe, relative exposure has increased in several western and southern European states including France, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands. In general, changes in exposure of production (measured by GDP) and wealth are in line with trends in population, with some exceptions, e.g. in Italy and Hungary, where the percentage of wealth exposed has not changed since 1870 despite growth in the relative exposure of their national populations.

### The FDA at work: cutting-edge science promoting public health (...) [^146733b4]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

The idea, as President Theodore Roosevelt saw it, was to save capitalism by civilizing it. When America was founded, the Industrial Revolution had not arrived; the telephone and telegraph, railroad, airplane, and auto had not been created. Nor had the great engines of free markets been set up to drive it all forward into the modern era. The dream of the founders had. been of a placid agrarian society, where wealth and position were based on land ownership, and where decisions for the nation were taken not by lords but by citizens deliberating together. But soon a rush of change swept away those visions as machines were invented and applied in every field; factories were built up around those hissing, tapping steam beasts. Workers left the. farms for the cities to feed and operate the machines and to supply labor to the giant, national businesses--the first corporations, and America's first big bureaucracies. Getty Images.

The FDA regulates over 1 trillion dollars' worth of products, which accounts for 22 cents of every dollar spent annually by American consumers. U. S. Food and Drug Administration www. fda. gov An Era of Business Changes The upending of the settled, farming society had seemed impossible. "It was frightening and bewildering to many--that a whole society should be taken over by moneymaking and the pursuit of individual interest, " wrote historian Gordon Wood. President Abraham Lincoln was aghast. He said he saw it as the coming of a new class of tyrants to replace the kings and nobles just removed from their positions only 50 years before. "Corporations have been enthroned, " Lincoln said. "An era of corruption in high places will follow and the money power will endeavor to prolong its reign by working the prejudices of the people … until wealth is aggregated in a few. characterized, one thing is certain.

" The time "brought forth many changes in business life and left many evils that called to high heaven for remedy.

### Socioeconomic status and mortality: contribution of health care access and psychological distress among U.S. adults with diagnosed diabetes [^5d4d4094]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Socioeconomic status (SES) is a complex construct determined by an individual’s or group’s relative position within a society and based on socially derived economic factors. These relative levels of position within the societal hierarchy may result in inequalities in health. In epidemiologic research, SES is most commonly measured in terms of education, income, occupational social class, and, less often, financial wealth (–). Occupational social class often relates to whether an individual is employed in, for example, a nonmanagerial, managerial, working class, or professional capacity. Financial wealth relates to the accumulated assets of an individual, often measured in terms of investments, savings, home ownership, or other sources of economic security. However, recent empirical evidence indicates that these measures are not equally accurate indicators of SES.

Epidemiologic studies using a variety of SES measures have consistently shown that, in the general population, mortality risk increases as SES decreases (–). Furthermore, there is evidence that the influence of SES is cumulative over an individuals’ life.

Adults with low SES are disproportionately affected by diabetes and its complications. Among adults with diabetes, lower SES is associated with many factors known to contribute to poor health outcomes, including reduced access to and underuse of recommended preventive care, poor metabolic control, and psychological distress. Studies have examined the association between SES and mortality from diabetes in the general population and the relationship of SES and mortality among people with diabetes (–). However, most studies have focused on only one measure of SES or have used area-based SES measures. Furthermore, although some studies have included behavioral and clinical characteristics, none have included additional measures such as health care access and use or psychological factors.

Sources of vitamin D and cutaneous synthesis—“Most circulating vitamin D is synthesized from skin exposure to ultraviolet B (UV-B) radiation,” and “Vitamin D synthesis by the skin is the main source of this prohormone for most people,” with forms distinguished because “Vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol) is plant derived, whereas vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) is synthesized by animals.” Mechanistically, “7-Dehydrocholesterol (provitamin D) is a relatively rigid, 4-ringed structure” in epidermal membranes and “Exposure to UV-B in the wavelengths of 290 to 315 nm initiates the synthesis of vitamin D,” after which “Previtamin D isomerizes to vitamin D and then is transferred to extracellular space and dermal capillaries, where it binds with vitamin D–binding protein (DBP).” The complex is “transported to the liver for 25-hydroxylation to 25(OH)-D (calcidiol),” with subsequent renal steps whereby “25(OH)-D is released into the circulation and transported to the kidney bound to DBP for 1α-hydroxylation to 1,25(OH)2-D and for 24-hydroxylation to 24,25-dihydroxy vitamin D [24,25(OH)2-D],” noting that “1,25(OH)2-D (calcitriol) is the active form of vitamin D” and that “Nuclear receptors for 1,25(OH)2-D are present in >30 tissues.”

### Grassland intensification effects cascade to alter multifunctionality of wetlands within metaecosystems [^d61377ec]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Securing food production while safeguarding natural capital remains one of the grand challenges in the 21st century and a top priority on the global policy agenda. In an era of expanding population and wealth that leads to shifts towards resource-intensive diets, rising food demands are aggravating land-use conflicts and resource competition. While key to attaining food security and human livelihoods, agricultural intensification is an important driver of global change and significant contributor to rising environmental risks in the Anthropocene,. Climate change also poses substantial threats to resilience of agriculture, with disproportionate impacts on developing countries and marginalized communities,. It is thus vital to understand and explore transitions of agricultural systems towards a more ‘sustainable intensification’ paradigm, that encapsulates aims to boost productivity, improve ecosystem services, and bolster multifunctionality – the capacity of an ecosystem to simultaneously provide multiple functions or services.

As grasslands occupy ~25% of the Earth’s land surface and 70% of agricultural production area, they are dominant terrestrial ecosystems and critical components of global food security. Grazing lands are responsible for 40% of agricultural output (e.g. meat and dairy products) and support livelihoods of ~1.3 billion people worldwide. Besides agricultural products, grasslands also deliver a wide array of essential ecosystem services: they contribute to >10% of terrestrial net primary productivity, store up to 30% of global soil organic carbon –, and serve as key habitats for diverse fauna and flora. At local to regional scales, grasslands provide valuable regulating services, such as soil health, flood abatement, nutrient retention, pollination and pest control –.

Despite their social-ecological importance, grasslands remain understudied in sustainable development agendas. This undermines the long-term capacity of grasslands to support biodiversity and provide society with goods and services needed to prosper. One key threat for grasslands is land-use intensification. Conceptually, grassland intensification is often perceived as a conversion of natural and semi-natural grasslands to intensively-managed or cultivated grasslands,. Yet it entails a portfolio of integrated practices such as introduction of non-native productive forage species, high-intensity livestock grazing, fertilization, drainage, and frequent mechanical soil disturbances. Although intensification promotes forage and livestock production and contributes towards rural economic prosperity, it can also lead to persistent biodiversity loss and create unwanted declines and debts in other regulating and cultural ecosystem services,, thus compromising grassland multifunctionality.

### Key determinants of global land-use projections [^64837792]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Land use is at the core of various sustainable development goals. Long-term climate foresight studies have structured their recent analyses around five socio-economic pathways (SSPs), with consistent storylines of future macroeconomic and societal developments; however, model quantification of these scenarios shows substantial heterogeneity in land-use projections. Here we build on a recently developed sensitivity approach to identify how future land use depends on six distinct socio-economic drivers (population, wealth, consumption preferences, agricultural productivity, land-use regulation, and trade) and their interactions. Spread across models arises mostly from diverging sensitivities to long-term drivers and from various representations of land-use regulation and trade, calling for reconciliation efforts and more empirical research. Most influential determinants for future cropland and pasture extent are population and agricultural efficiency. Furthermore, land-use regulation and consumption changes can play a key role in reducing both land use and food-security risks, and need to be central elements in sustainable development strategies.

### Solutions for a cultivated planet [^29661941]. Nature (2011). Excellent credibility.

Increasing population and consumption are placing unprecedented demands on agriculture and natural resources. Today, approximately a billion people are chronically malnourished while our agricultural systems are concurrently degrading land, water, biodiversity and climate on a global scale. To meet the world's future food security and sustainability needs, food production must grow substantially while, at the same time, agriculture's environmental footprint must shrink dramatically. Here we analyse solutions to this dilemma, showing that tremendous progress could be made by halting agricultural expansion, closing 'yield gaps' on underperforming lands, increasing cropping efficiency, shifting diets and reducing waste. Together, these strategies could double food production while greatly reducing the environmental impacts of agriculture.

### Exploring the GP-patient relationship: a historical narration [^45856207]. Medical Humanities (2025). Medium credibility.

Selecting from a wealth of source material is always a challenge and is compounded in this paper by the profound subjectivity of ‘relationships’. As a starting point, two well-respected histories of general practice and the NHS were used alongside an appraisal of annual editorials (1953–2024) of the Journal of the (Royal) College of General Practitioners / British Journal of General Practitioners. It is hoped that as the professional journal for UK GPs, this might ensure identification of particularly salient issues. From these, an iterative snowballing approach identified other relevant materials alongside a concomitant hermeneutic cycle of interpretation. As Yin has emphasised, ‘every document was written for some specific purpose and some specific audience other than that of the [case] study being done’ (, 87) and as such are representations of ‘the social perception of facts; […] subject to social pressures from the context in which they are obtained’ (, 13–14). They must therefore be approached with appropriate caution. Moreover, the integral involvement of the researcher necessitates a high degree of reflexivity. Bannister has argued that this enables researchers to ‘choose personally relevant issues of research, to draw on, and make explicit personal experience, [and] to enjoy the wisdom and companionship of your subject’ (, 199) but it is essential to ensure rigour in this process—both as regards the choice and inclusion of source material and during the act of analytical interpretation. In this paper reflexivity was attempted by triangulating multiple sources to ensure appropriate convergent interpretation alongside disconfirmatory examples; the findings were informally discussed with academics from different backgrounds as well as contemporary GPs; and self-reflective accounts were used throughout the process (, 36).

### Health and nutrition knowledge, attitudes and practices of pregnant women attending and not-attending ANC clinics in Western Kenya: a cross-sectional analysis [^469b6703]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2013). Low credibility.

Independent variables

The primary independent variable was attendance at ANC clinic (yes vs. no) at the time of the survey. We conceptualized ANC clinics as a key resource for pregnant women to attain knowledge regarding health and nutrition. Based on our review of the literature and evidence from a systematic review of factors affecting the utilization of antenatal care in developing countries, we further identified maternal, household, and village-level factors that would confound the association between ANC utilization and nutrition and health KAP (Figure 1). Increased uptake and coverage of ANC has been previously associated with higher maternal age, lower parity, higher maternal educational level, and higher socio-economic status [,,-].

Figure 1 
Conceptual model.

We used the conceptual framework to guide the variable selection for the adjusted analysis in this study. Maternal demographic and socioeconomic characteristics from the survey, including age, gestational age, marital status, education level, agricultural activity and selling agricultural products, involvement in income generating activities, and radio use, as a proxy for media interaction, were identified as possible confounders in the association between ANC utilization and dependent KAP outcomes. At the household-level, household head education level, household size, and socio-economic status were identified as potential confounders of ANC use. The wealth index was used as a proxy for household socio-economic status, derived by constructing a scale from household-quality variables, such as type of housing and roofing, presence and type of toilet, the source of cooking fuel and the source of water during dry season, in addition to possession of household assets such as radio, television, telephone/mobile, solar panels, gas cooker, bicycle, water pump, motorcycle, car truck, tractor, and generator. The wealth index was categorized into quartiles for descriptive analysis. Community-level variables such as village size, the presence of village health and nutrition committees or other health interventions in the areas, and distance to the nearest health facility were recognized as factors that influenced the ability to seek ANC services and maternal KAP.

### Cost of childbirth in upper west region of Ghana: a cross-sectional study [^966f6302]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Data processing and analysis

The data were collected using a paper-based questionnaire and then double entered by two data entry clerks using EPI Data 6.1. After entry, the data was cleaned and verified and inconsistent entries from the two data entry clerks were checked from the source questionnaire and corrections made.

Data were then transferred to STATA version 16.0 for cleaning and analysis. Frequencies and cross tabulations were used to clean up the data by finding outliers, missing values, and verifying for consistency among variables. Tables were created to display frequencies, proportions and means. The cost of childbirth was estimated from the patient perspective.

The total childbirth cost was calculated as the sum of direct medical and non-medical costs. The direct medical costs covered OOPPs for registration cards, consultations, diagnosis (scanning and laboratory tests), drugs and medical supplies. Direct non-medical costs included OOPPs for transportation to and from health facilities, informal payments as well as other non-medical costs such as disinfectant, a rubber bed spread, cotton, gauze, childbirth mat and spirit. Informal payments are payments in cash or non-cash that, in addition to the specified contribution, are provided by patients or their relatives to the health care providers for services that the patients are legally entitled to receive.

The annual income of households was calculated using the estimated cost of yields or proceeds from agricultural products such as crops and poultry as well as from salaries or wages from businesses, and income from investments or gifts.

Furthermore, a wealth assets index was estimated using principal component analysis (PCA). The household assets used in computing the wealth index include main materials used for the floor, materials used for the roof, materials used for exterior walls, the main sources of drinking water, and ownership or use of a toilet facility, radios, clocks, television sets, mobile phones, landline telephones, refrigerators, freezers, electric generators, washing machines, computers, photo cameras, digital versatile discs (DVDs), sewing machines, beds, table cabinets/cupboards, wrist watches, bicycles, motorcycles, animal-drawn carts, cars and boats. Households were then assigned to five quintiles which described household wealth levels and represented as: poorest (Q1), very poor (Q2), poor (Q3), less poor (Q4) and least poor (Q5).

### A social engineering model for poverty alleviation [^b6d5db38]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Poverty, the quintessential denominator of a developing nation, has been traditionally defined against an arbitrary poverty line; individuals (or countries) below this line are deemed poor and those above it, not so! This has two pitfalls. First, absolute reliance on a single poverty line, based on basic food consumption, and not on total consumption distribution, is only a partial poverty index at best. Second, a single expense descriptor is an exogenous quantity that does not evolve from income-expenditure statistics. Using extensive income-expenditure statistics from India, here we show how a self-consistent endogenous poverty line can be derived from an agent-based stochastic model of market exchange, combining all expenditure modes (basic food, other food and non-food), whose parameters are probabilistically estimated using advanced Machine Learning tools. Our mathematical study establishes a consumption based poverty measure that combines labor, commodity, and asset market outcomes, delivering an excellent tool for economic policy formulation.

### Is the worst of the COVID-19 global pandemic yet to come? Application of financial mathematics as candidate predictive tools [^10087405]. Translational Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In 1938, Ralph Nelson Elliott, an accountant by profession, argued that the stock market is a phenomenon governed by crowd psychology. In his classic books The Wave Principle and Nature’s Law: The Secret of the Universe, Elliott described that human emotions, which tend to be rhythmical and follow patterns of optimism and pessimism, are instrumental in shaping market dynamics. The sentiments of the crowd can lead to quantifiable patterns in human activities, and when applied to financial markets, such patterns are observed in the movement of asset (stocks, commodities, etc.) prices across time scales ranging from hours to years. These observations made by Elliott lead to his description of the Wave Principle, which is used by traders for technical analysis to understand market behavior and predict future trends. Given the ability of Elliott Wave Principle to describe human sentiment-driven activities, we hereby hypothesized that the Wave Principle could also describe the epidemiological evolution of the COVID-19 global pandemic.

Our hypothesis can be contextualized through a simple thought experiment. Imagine two healthy individuals A and B of the same age, living in a common geographical location with prevalence of COVID-19 cases, such that public health policies related to gatherings, masks, business closures, and social distancing are in effect. While individual A strictly and unchangingly obeys the policies, individual B tends to be more casual and is influenced by external or internal factors (such as fluctuations in daily new cases or the need to socialize and be outdoors) in their adherence to the policies. Simply put, individual A follows the guidelines objectively as long as they are in place, while their counterpart is more amenable to their subjective choice, driven primarily by feelings, in following the guidelines. Although biologically, the two individuals maybe equally prone to infections, but behaviorally speaking, it can be safely argued that individual A and their likes are less prone to infections during a pandemic, while individuals like B tend to be more vulnerable and thus fuel the growth of the pandemic. With this premise, we investigated the ability of the sentiment-driven Elliott Wave Principle in describing the evolution of the COVID-19 global pandemic. To the best of our knowledge, the current work is the first ever application of Elliott Wave Principle to the study of epidemiology of viral infections at the global or regional scale.

### The changing impact of rural electrification on Indian agriculture [^772afa43]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Our regression model omits the lowest consumption percentile (15th percentile) from non-PC districts to avoid multi-collinearity. Figure 5 presents the difference in irrigated area for the remaining consumption percentiles relative to this reference category. Compared to the poorest 15th percentile of households, all other farming households in non-PC districts irrigated larger amounts of cultivated land during Rabi. However, no similar difference in irrigated area was found between the poorest 15th percentile households in non-PC districts and households among PC districts that were even in the top 85th consumption percentile.

No wealth gradient was detected for Kharif irrigated area and is perhaps reflective of the non-essentiality of irrigation during Kharif due to the monsoons. A point to note here—data limitations prevent us from making any distinction between the different irrigation sources in this estimation, but it is safe to assume that irrigated area majorly implies groundwater irrigation at least during Rabi. Surface water irrigation is useful only during the monsoons and could be one of the reasons that explains the missing gradient during Kharif—gravity flow-based irrigation from canals and other surface storage offer little control to farmers and are dependent on the amount of rainfall received in that year. Therefore individual household wealth likely has a small role to play in irrigated area during Kharif.

### Mediators and adverse effects of child poverty in the United States [^3559db7e]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Defining and describing poverty in the United States—poverty is defined as a state in which one lacks a usual or socially acceptable amount of money or material possessions to provide for basic needs. In the United States, the federal poverty level (FPL) operationalizes and measures poverty; each year the US Department of Health and Human Services develops poverty guidelines and thresholds on the basis of family size and composition, based on census data and loosely referred to as the FPL. Income and demographic data for FPL estimates come from the Current Population Survey, an annual nationally representative household survey jointly conducted by the US Census Bureau and the US Bureau of Labor Statistics within the US Department of Labor. Historically, the FPL was developed in the early 1960s using US Department of Agriculture’s 1955 Food Consumption Survey; research in the 1950s found that the average US family spent one-third of its pretax income on food, and the federal poverty measure was determined by multiplying the basic food plan cost by 3 using the Economy Food Plan. The federal poverty measure has not changed fundamentally since 1969, except that it is adjusted annually.

### Antibiotic prescription from qualified sources for children with fever / cough: cross-sectional study from 59 low-and middle-income countries [^2ae19766]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Table 3 
Weighted descriptive statistics of socio-economic variables associated with prescriptions from qualified and unqualified sources.

The percentage of antibiotics taken for fever/cough from qualified sources for children aged one year, two years, three years, four years, and five years are 75.7%, 73.8%, 73.4%, 72.0%, and 71.4%, respectively. However, 32.3% of the variable was missing. According to their mothers' occupations—agricultural, manual labour, professional/technical/managerial, others, and mothers who did not work—children under the age of five received 72.2%, 72.7%, 74.7%, 76.0%, and 70.7% of their antibiotics from qualified sources, respectively. The missing percentage of this variable was 16.2%. On the other hand, the percentage of antibiotics taken from qualified sources for children under five on the basis of their mothers’ partner/husband’s occupation were 76.3% (agricultural), 71.7% (manual labour), 71.7% (professional/technical/managerial), 72.8% (others) and 72.7% whose mothers’ partner did not work. However, there were 22.2% missing response in this variable. The percentage of children taking antibiotics for fever/cough from qualified sources in terms of their BMI are 74.5% for <9.9, 74.2% for 9.9–14.9, 72.9% for 14–18.5, 75.3% for 18.5–24.9 and 72.1% for >24.9 of BMI index. In this variable, there were 36.1% missing responses. According to the wealth index of child’s family, the percentage of taking antibiotics for fever/cough is 73.7% for poorest, 73.2% for poorer, 74.1% for middle, 75.5% for richer and 73.7% for richest. For children who had vaccination at least once, the percentage who had taken antibiotics for fever/cough from qualified sources was 66.6%. In comparison, for children who never had vaccination the percentage who had taken antibiotics from qualified sources was 63.1%. However, there was 72.6% missing for this variable.

### Associations between household air pollution and early child development among children aged 36-59 months in Bangladesh [^2be3ae9c]. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (2022). Medium credibility.

Measures of HAP exposure

SFU (clean vs solid fuels) and levels of exposure to SFU (unexposed, moderately exposed and highly exposed) were proxy measures of HAP. A child is considered ‘exposed’ to HAP if the household reports the use of coal, charcoal, wood, straw/shrubs, animal dung or agricultural crop residue as a primary source of energy for cooking in the traditional solid fuel cookstove and is considered ‘unexposed’ if the household reports the use of electricity, liquefied petroleum gas, natural gas and/or biogas as a primary source of energy for cooking in the clean cookstove. We developed an augmented Hwhich are more rural divisions andAP exposure index: levels of exposure to HAP accounting for SFU, cooking place and ventilation for solid fuel cookstoves to improve the HAP exposure measurement.Children were categorised as unexposed if household reported clean fuel use (coded 0), moderately exposed if the households reported SFU, separate or outdoor cooking place and chimney or fan for solid fuel cookstove (coded 1) and highly exposed if the households reported SFU, location of cooking inside the house and no chimney or fan for solid fuel cookstove (coded 2).

Covariates and potential confounders

Based on the prior literature,variables that are known to be associated with ECD or exposure to HAP were included as potential confounders. Models were adjusted for the following covariates: child sex, child age, maternal age, maternal education, household wealth quintiles, iodine status, stunting, attendance to early childhood education (ECE) programme, cooking place, season and urbanicity. Household wealth quintiles (index of available durable and non-durable household assets) generated by MICS included types of cooking fuels; however, to avoid over adjustment in inferential models, household wealth quintiles were reconstructed, excluding the type of cooking fuel used in the household (code is available on request). The Household Wealth Index was then categorised into five quintiles, with the lowest quintile reflecting the poorest households and the highest quintile the wealthiest households.

### The economic, agricultural, and food security repercussions of a wild pollinator collapse in Europe [^e66fc3b7]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Our welfare and food intake outcomes represent average national households, limiting the ability to analyze impacts on particularly vulnerable groups. This is a known constraint in multi-regional or global economic simulations. Nonetheless, our findings reveal notable disparities in welfare decline across Europe (Fig. 3B), with low-income countries, where food expenses consume a larger share of household budgets, facing disproportionately high impacts. This likely extends to lower-income households within wealthier countries. The production of pollination-dependent crops, such as oilseeds, vegetables, and fruits, is vital for farmers and rural communities, though the economic effects of a pollinator loss on these communities are complex. Our model suggests that some producers of pollination-dependent crops may benefit from the “King-Davenant law”, as higher prices can offset yield reductions for certain crops like sunflower, tomatoes, and apples. Lower yields per area could increase harvest costs,, which are not captured in detail in our model. Therefore, the changes in producer surplus need to be interpreted with caution.

The significant correlation between consumer surplus losses and EU member states’ resistance to pollinator-friendly policies, measured by the average voting behavior of EU parliament members, is an incidental finding that warrants further investigation. This relationship may suggest that regions facing the greatest economic impacts from a pollinator collapse may be less supportive of biodiversity policies, potentially due to concerns about immediate economic or other reasons, such as doubts about the policies’ effectiveness,. A similar pattern was observed in a study that showed that countries in the Americas and Asia, despite their increasing reliance on pollination-dependent crops, often expand agricultural practices that undermine pollination services. Our study did not originally set out to examine any political-economic aspects, and it remains limited in scope without investigating causal relationships. Future research could investigate potential confounding factors, such as countries’ agricultural dependency as a share of GDP, to better understand why some regions may exhibit higher resistance despite clear economic risks. Additionally, understanding how changes in both consumer and producer surplus interact with policy preferences could offer valuable insights into the socio-economic dynamics of environmental policy support. For instance, while consumer losses correlate negatively with policy support, the positive correlation between producer surplus gains and voting behavior may reflect different economic incentives or concerns about  costs  (Supplementary Fig. 4).

### Affordability of the EAT-Lancet reference diet: a global analysis [^1273d04b]. The Lancet: Global Health (2020). High credibility.

Implications of all the available evidence

Our findings indicate that a widespread global shift to the EAT– Lancet diets is feasible only through some combination of higher earnings, more favourable market prices, and nutrition assistance for low-income people, in addition to changes in local and global food systems that drive food choice among more affluent populations. Meeting EAT– Lancet targets in low-income areas will require higher farm productivity and lower food prices, plus greater non-farm earnings and social safety nets, allowing people to shift consumption away from starchy staples and increase their intake of more nutritious but currently unaffordable animal-sourced and vegetal foods.

### How do Malawian women rate the quality of maternal and newborn care? Experiences and perceptions of women in the central and Southern regions [^b0c31d00]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2015). Low credibility.

Analytical approach

Three statistical approaches were used in the analysis. First, a pre-analysis was conducted to test the validity and reliability of the newly adapted psychometric scale to measure perceived service quality. Specifically, for each perceived quality of care scale (ANC, delivery, PNC), Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) was conducted to confirm the structure of the psychometric scale, i.e. whether the data supports the intended assignment of the scale statements to the quality of care dimension. In addition to this investigation of the factor analytic structure of the overall scales, Cronbach’s alpha (α) was calculated on each perceived quality dimension subscale for each service to determine the reliability of rated statements retained in each perception scale. The CFA results as well as α statistics are presented in the result section.

Second, descriptive univariate analyses were performed to inspect frequency distribution of variables that we selected as explanatory variables (Table 1 shows the specific variables). While most of the variables are self-explanatory, we measured woman’s wealth using household asset ownership i.e. sewing machine, television, radio, and bicycle; characteristics of dwelling house i.e. type of materials used for the wall, roof and floor, source of electricity, source of drinking water, type of toilet facility; ownership of agricultural assets i.e. farm land, goats, sheep, pigs and poultry. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used to generate a household wealth index from these variables based on which participants were assigned to wealth quartiles, with the categories labelled from 1 to 4 (1 being the poorest and 4 the wealthiest).

### Productive ecosystems and the arrow of development [^98cbfc43]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Economic growth is associated with the diversification of economic activities, which can be observed via the evolution of product export baskets. Exporting a new product is dependent on having, and acquiring, a specific set of capabilities, making the diversification process path-dependent. Taking an agnostic view on the identity of the capabilities, here we derive a probabilistic model for the directed dynamical process of capability accumulation and product diversification of countries. Using international trade data, we identify the set of pre-existing products, the product Ecosystem, that enables a product to be exported competitively. We construct a directed network of products, the Eco Space, where the edge weight corresponds to capability overlap. We uncover a modular structure, and show that low- and middle-income countries move from product communities dominated by small Ecosystem products to advanced (large Ecosystem) product clusters over time. Finally, we show that our network model is predictive of product appearances.

### Unequal exchange is not primarily about monetary value [^3f3f2ef4]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Our propensity to translate transfers of physical substances into flows of monetary values derives from centuries of economic discourse and labour theories of value. This eschewing of the material in favour of the semiotic (given that money is a species of sign), exemplifies the conceptual separation of nature and society in modern thought. It explains why we have been unable to grasp the socio-natural essence of the technological systems amassed in core areas of the world-system since the Industrial Revolution. The underlying assumption is that technologies simply represent engineering knowledge applied to nature and that provisioning them with the requisite material resources is a separate issue, to be dealt with by economists. A more integrated understanding of technological systems is to see them as social strategies for appropriating embodied human labour time and natural space from peripheral areas. To take an iconic example, the Industrial Revolution in 19th-century Britain built on resources from throughout the world-system; each bale of cotton from North America embodied substantial amounts of African slave labour as well as hectares of American land to grow the cotton and feed its harvesters. Reinforced by monetary flows, the accumulation of industrial technomass is a local manifestation of global processes. Although conventionally understood to reflect flows of money, it is also irrefutably material.

### Otitis media sequelae and hearing in adolescence after administration of an 11-valent conjugate pneumococcal vaccine in infancy: a prospective cohort study with long-term follow-up of the ARIVAC trial [^74e81d02]. The Lancet: Child & Adolescent Health (2024). High credibility.

Statistical analysis

Assuming a rate of otitis media with effusion plus chronic suppurative otitis media of 5% in unvaccinated children (based on the rate from our previous study in Bali),5000 of the ARIVAC study participants would need to be followed up to detect a 40% relative risk reduction in otitis media with effusion and chronic suppurative otitis media with 80% power and a two-tailed 5% false positive α rate. For 90% power, 7000 of the ARIVAC study participants would need to be followed up in this 11PCV study.

The primary objective for this analysis was to compare moderate-to-severe ear disease during adolescence between the vaccine and placebo groups. The secondary objective was to compare mild hearing loss or moderate-to-profound hearing loss in the worst ear during adolescence between the vaccine and placebo groups. The tertiary post-hoc objectives were the comparison of reductions in mild or moderate-to-profound hearing loss between the vaccine and placebo groups in adolescents with moderate-to-severe ear disease. Relative and absolute risk reductions with 95% CIsin the vaccine group compared with the placebo group for all outcomes were computed using.

Comparisons of categorical demographic characteristics were made for participants enrolled in this 11PCV study and those in ARIVAC who were lost to follow-up and not available for enrolment in this 11PCV study to determine whether the current 11PCV study sample was representative of the original ARIVAC sample. Demographic characteristics and potential risk factors were also compared using univariable statistics between vaccine and placebo groups in the 11PCV study. The socioeconomic index was computed using the Demographic and Health Survey Wealth Index. Diagnostic codes for otitis media (chronic suppurative otitis media, otitis media with effusion, and acute otitis media) were included in the ARIVAC database for children who were admitted to hospital or were seen in a study clinic. The occurrences of otitis media before age 2 years recorded during ARIVAC were compared with occurrences of otitis media reported in this 11PCV follow-up study using odds ratios and 95% CIs. Descriptive statistics of pure tone averages for children with and without hearing loss were compared separately by the type of moderate-to-severe ear disease. Statistical methods used for these comparisons are described in the appendix (p 68). A p value of less than 0·05 was used as the significance threshold.

### Anatomy and resilience of the global production ecosystem [^3c46a9d4]. Nature (2019). Excellent credibility.

Much of the Earth's biosphere has been appropriated for the production of harvestable biomass in the form of food, fuel and fibre. Here we show that the simplification and intensification of these systems and their growing connection to international markets has yielded a global production ecosystem that is homogenous, highly connected and characterized by weakened internal feedbacks. We argue that these features converge to yield high and predictable supplies of biomass in the short term, but create conditions for novel and pervasive risks to emerge and interact in the longer term. Steering the global production ecosystem towards a sustainable trajectory will require the redirection of finance, increased transparency and traceability in supply chains, and the participation of a multitude of players, including integrated 'keystone actors' such as multinational corporations.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). Medium credibility.

Key economic concepts—scarcity and opportunity cost emphasize that the most fundamental concept is scarcity, that “societies do not have enough resources to satisfy all of their citizens’ wants and needs,” and therefore “trade-offs, must be made.” This need for trade-offs underlies opportunity cost, the idea of cost as “that which must be sacrificed to obtain something else,” and in medical care it is “whatever else we might desire that cannot be produced because of the decision to produce more health care,” with the reminder that “deferring trade-offs does not eliminate the need to make them.”

### Why do children continue to suffer from' food poverty'? [^2d8bc9e5]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2024). High credibility.

Next, while ‘harmful social and cultural and norms’ find due space (p 44), religious dietary beliefs are not mentioned, although the report notes animal-source foods as the densest source of nutrients, with less than 5% of children in severe child food poverty consuming them. Agriculture barely makes it to the analysis as a significant domain of crisis resulting from climate change and economic policy. While calling upon governments to limit conflicts of interest, the Scaling Up of Nutrition programme founded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the European Union is upheld uncritically, even as this programme has been widely critiqued as a ‘multistakeholder programme’ that includes food business companies.

Thus, there is a ‘stopping short’ in the report that leads us to systems, but not far enough to structures. If the main drivers of hunger and food poverty are climate change, conflict and economic crisis, is there not a common root? The report notes that the Ukraine war has increased child food poverty. The interpretation is strange: ‘the need for shock-responsive social protection programmes that are able to anticipate and respond swiftly to shocks’. There is neither questioning of the essential root cause nor a demand to end the war, or all wars.

### Socio-economic factors associated with open defecation among agricultural households: a cross-sectional study in Haiti [^b845a89e]. BMJ Public Health (2023). High credibility.

Definition of variables

Dependent variable

The dependent variable of the study is OD. The respondents were asked a specific question about their toilet facility, and OD was one of the response modalities. The OD variable was coded ‘yes’ if a household practised OD, and ‘no’ otherwise.

Independent variables

The selection of covariates was done following a literature review on factors found to significantly influence OD practice in various studies conducted in low-income and middle-income countriesincluding Haiti.Few studies have focused on farmers’ or agricultural households’ OD practices. We propose logical variables as indicators of farmers’ activities that might influence their OD practices through time consumption, as suggested by Osumanu et al.These variables were agricultural specialisation, fragmentation of their plots, livestock and average distance to their plots.

We used 15 variables as covariates in this study: department of residence, gender and age of the household head, level of education, household size, access to the mass media, number of plots and average distance between them and the house, farm size, livestock, level of agricultural specialisation, participation in local organisations, farm income, off farm income and remittance. Statistics are related to both farmers as head of the households and the whole socio-economic unit represented by the households’ members. Their location, education, different sources of income and other assets such as social ones which conveys institutional capital are taken into account. To test our hypothesis, we developed appropriate variables such as distance to plots, number of plots and level of agricultural specialisation of the household members to analyse agricultural characteristics. The livestock was coded into conventional tropical livestock units (TLU also called Unité Bovins Tropicaux (UBT) in French), where one TLU is equivalent to 1 zebu or 12 goats. Collected data on incomes, including agricultural revenues, remittances and off farm revenues are used as a proxy of wealth. For statistical reasons, we transformed those data into scale variables. We did the same for all quantitative variables.

### Impact of small farmers' access to improved seeds and deforestation in DR Congo [^a9616455]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Since the 1960s, the increased availability of modern seed varieties in developing countries has had large positive effects on households' well-being. However, the effect of related land use changes on deforestation and biodiversity is ambiguous. This study examines this question through a randomized control trial in a remote area in the Congo Basin rainforest with weak input and output markets. Using plot-level data on land conversion combined with remote sensing data, we find that promotion of modern seed varieties did not lead to an increase in overall deforestation by small farmers. However, farmers cleared more primary forest and less secondary forest. We attribute this to the increased demand for nitrogen required by the use of some modern seed varieties, and to the lack of alternative sources of soil nutrients, which induced farmers to shift towards cultivation of land cleared in primary forest. Unless combined with interventions to maintain soil fertility, policies to promote modern seed varieties may come at the cost of important losses in biodiversity.

### Assessing value-for-money in maternal and newborn health [^f0bdffc8]. BMJ Global Health (2017). Medium credibility.

What is value-for-money?

VfM generally refers to a product or service being worth the money spent on it. This concept of making good use of money is not novel and has been embedded in assessments of several health interventions implemented in the public sector,where it is often used as a synonym for ‘cost-effectiveness’.However, within the international development field, VfM generally refers to a broader concept encompassing economy, efficiency and effectiveness, in addition to cost-effectiveness.

The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development describes VfM as ‘the optimum combination of whole-life cost and quality to meet the user's requirement’.New Zealand Aid describes VfM as ‘achieving the best possible development outcomes over the life of an activity relative to the total cost of managing and resourcing that activity and ensuring that resources are used effectively, economically, and without waste’.The National Audit Office in the UK describes VfM as ‘the optimal use of resources to achieve the intended outcomes’.Finally, the UK Department for International Development describes VfM as ‘the best use of resources to achieve intended sustainable outcomes and impact’.These descriptions show that VfM consists of several interlinked components. Altogether, the consensus is that VfM is not a tool or a method, but rather an approach to provide evidence for better resource allocation.

To better describe VfM, the economy, effectiveness and efficiency (3Es) and cost-effectiveness (CE) framework was proposed. This framework is linked to a logical chain of events which reflects the intervention's theory of change (figure 2).The VfM components address four key questions: Are implementers or funders buying the inputs of appropriate quality and at the right price? (economy), How well are implementers converting the inputs into outputs? (efficiency), How well are the outputs generated from an intervention achieving the desired outcomes? (effectiveness) and How much impact does an intervention achieve relative to the inputs that have been invested? (cost-effectiveness).

### Over-exploitation of natural resources is followed by inevitable declines in economic growth and discount rate [^0daee209]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

A major challenge in environmental policymaking is determining whether and how fast our society should adopt sustainable management methods. These decisions may have long-lasting effects on the environment, and therefore, they depend critically on the discount factor, which determines the relative values given to future environmental goods compared to present ones. The discount factor has been a major focus of debate in recent decades, and nevertheless, the potential effect of the environment and its management on the discount factor has been largely ignored. Here we show that to maximize social welfare, policymakers need to consider discount factors that depend on changes in natural resource harvest at the global scale. Particularly, the more our society over-harvests today, the more policymakers should discount the near future, but the less they should discount the far future. This results in a novel discount formula that implies significantly higher values for future environmental goods.

### The changing impact of rural electrification on Indian agriculture [^3cb58322]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Here the outcome variables Y i t are the number of groundwater wells powered by different pumping energy sources for block b in district i, at time t. These outcomes are measured using data from the Minor Irrigation censuses. The continuous variableis the log of the total night time luminosity in block b in district i and time t from DMSP-OLS. PC i is the same binary treatment variable as in model (1) and takes the value 1 for districts that had less than 50% of rural households electrified by 2001. The coefficient on the interaction ofwith PC i, β, is of main interest. It captures the difference in the effect of electrification measured by night time luminosity on pump electrification between blocks in PC and non-PC districts. The control variable, X i t, includes the total number of villages. γ t denotes year fixed effects to control for aggregate time shocks common across all districts. Standard errors are clustered at the district level.

In the second set of analyses using household-level data, we compare seasonal irrigated areas in 2013 between households in pre and post policy change which are in the same wealth percentiles. Figure 5 reports results from the regression:where, Y h i is irrigated area for household h in district i. ConsPerc hi is the wealth indicator measured by the per capita consumption percentile of household h in district i, and PC i is 1 for districts electrifying post policy change and 0 for pre-policy change districts, the same binary variable used in model (1). X h i is a vector of control variables at the household level and includes the total land cultivated by the household and other household and head of household controls such as household size, expenditure on non-farm activities and education and agricultural training of the household head. Rain i is the cumulative average monthly rainfall in district i from January to June 2013, when the survey was conducted for Rabi and July to December 2012 for Kharif. Since agricultural policy is a state subject in India, we include State i to control for state-level differences in agricultural policy, which could impact irrigated areas. By including state fixed effects, our estimates effectively compare households across PC and non-PC districts within the same state. We cluster standard errors at the district level.

### Unequal exchange is not primarily about monetary value [^d5e9197f]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Research has shown that there is a substantial net transfer of embodied labour from the global South to the global North— a shorthand for the structural polarity of lower- versus higher-income country groupings –. Significantly more labour time has been spent in producing the commodities exported from low-income to high-income countries than in producing those traded in the opposite direction. The empirical evidence is indisputable. But the question is what the implications are: how should these transfers be phrased and interpreted? Alongside the rigorous exercises in methodology, involving phenomena that clearly have a physical, natural-science dimension, the topic of unequal exchange invites conceptual and epistemological considerations that must include aspects of social theory. This Comment argues that unequal exchange should be understood as transfers of biophysical resources rather than economic values—and that this choice of phrasing should be more of a challenge to mainstream economics.

Many scholars ultimately appear to assume that unequal exchange implies an international transfer of value, even if this is not directly stated. For instance, Hickel et al.provide the caveat that their translation of embodied labour hours into monetary values is mainly a “thought experiment”, but there are several other parts of their argument on “value transfers” that suggest that they agree with Emmanuel, Amin, and others that there is indeed an international transfer or appropriation of value. The penultimate sentence of their Supplementary Discussions 1warns that “all monetary representations of value…should be treated with caution”, but this begs the question of how value could possibly be represented in some other metric than money? The labour theory of value that guided Emmanuel and Amin can only be conceptualised in monetary terms—in recent years, this has been convincingly argued by Marxist scholars advocating so-called Value-Form Theory. The authors repeatedly refer to the “wage value” of appropriated labour. To conclude from global discrepancies in wages that there is an international transfer of value is to reify value into some kind of substance that is created at certain points in the system. It prompts us to ask if arbitrage based on global differences in the price of land should similarly be understood in terms of ”value transfers”?

### Factors associated with adoption of beneficial newborn care practices in rural Eastern Uganda: a cross-sectional study [^5358e2c1]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2016). Low credibility.

To generate household socio-economic status (SES), we considered the following variables: floor material, roof material, wall material, fuel used for cooking, source of light and other household possessions (i.e. radio, type of bed, table refrigerator, television set, sound cassette player, and telephone), agricultural land, and farm animals (chicken, goats, cows, pigs, sheep). These variables were screened for relevance and reliability using Cronbach’s alpha (which was found to be 0.628) and acceptable. The final list of variables included agricultural land, type of floor material, type of roof material, wall material, fuel used for cooking, and source of light. We performed Principal Component Analysis (PCA), scored the first principal component, and used it to generate an asset index. The asset index was then used to group all households into wealth quartiles; i.e. <25 % = Lowest, 25–50 % = Low, 50–75 % = Middle and >75 % = High socio-economic status). We merged the ‘lowest’ and ‘low’ quartiles into “low” because lowest had very few values while “middle” and “high” were left intact. This resulted in three socio-economic status levels, namely: low, middle and high, as presented in the Tables.

### The texture of neighborhoods and disability among older adults [^26fd8221]. The Journals of Gerontology: Series B, Psychological Sciences and Social Sciences (2012). Low credibility.

Objectives

To present and test an ecological multidimensional model of neighborhood characteristics and examine its relationship to older disability among older adults.

Method

Indicators of social vulnerability, wealth, violence, storefronts, residential stability, and the presence of physicians, supermarkets, and fast-food establishments for 1,644 of New Jersey's census tracts were derived from sources that include the U.S. Census 2000, Uniform Crime Report for New Jersey, New Jersey Department of Agriculture, Division of Marketing and Development, New Jersey Department of Law and Public Safety Division of Alcohol Beverage Control, and Health Resources and Services Administration Geospatial Data Warehouse. Confirmatory factor analyses were used to develop and test a measurement model of neighborhood texture. Structural equation modeling examined the relationships between neighborhood characteristics and disability of persons aged 65-69 years.

Results

Analyses revealed that distinct dimensions of neighborhoods could be modeled with administrative data and that neighborhood contextual (supermarkets, physicians, storefronts, violence) and compositional (social vulnerability, wealth, residential stability) characteristics were related to the prevalence of disability.

Discussion

The use of multiple indicators of neighborhood with good psychometric qualities is critical for advancing knowledge about the mechanisms by which neighborhood characteristics are associated with the health of older people.

3.4 Tree cover loss

Headline finding: between 2016 and 2022, the world lost almost 182 million hectares of forest cover, 5% of global tree cover

Trees and forests are crucial carbon sinks and biodiversity reservoirs. They can also be a source of food, medicine, and knowledge, especially for Indigenous peoples.Poor tree cover and inadequate forest conservation exacerbate climate change and increase the risk of forest fires, zoonotic diseases, and allergies. Understanding the patterns of tree cover loss is vital for supporting climate strategies and public health (panel 4). – This indicator uses satellite data to track the loss of vegetation 5 m or taller in areas with at least 30% tree cover density. As such, it covers the loss of forests, open woodlands, trees in agricultural settings and urban areas, and small patches of trees.

Between 2001 and 2022, the world lost approximately 459 384 000 hectares (11·5%) of its tree cover. Of these losses, 40% (181 847 000 hectares [5%] of global tree cover) have occurred since 2016, the year the Paris Agreement entered into force. Tree cover loss was highest in very high HDI countries, which have lost almost 90 million hectares since 2016. Three of the four countries that have lost the most tree cover since 2016 are classified as very high HDI: Russia (35 837 000 hectares), the USA (14 993 000 hectares), and Canada (14 983 000 hectares). Brazil, a high HDI country, had the second-highest loss of tree cover globally in this period (25 136 000 hectares). Despite increasing, tree cover loss was lower in low and medium HDI countries, at 20 and 22 million hectares lost, respectively, since 2016 (figure 9). Forestry activities were the cause of 30% of the global tree cover loss between 2016 and 2022, followed by agriculture (27%), wildfires (22%), and commodity-driven deforestation (20%).

The continuous and increasing tree cover loss underscores the urgent need for concerted global and regional efforts to support tree conservation and the role of forests in promoting health and addressing climate change. With 36% of the world’s intact forests within Indigenous peoples’ lands, ensuring Indigenous peoples’ involvement in forest protection efforts is of crucial importance.

Circulation (2014). Medium credibility.

Key economic concepts—scarcity, opportunity cost, and efficiency are defined to frame value assessment. Scarcity is foundational: “the most fundamental of which is the concept of scarcity,” requiring that “choices, or more precisely trade-offs, must be made,” and leading to the notion of cost as “opportunity cost.” “The opportunity cost of medical care is whatever else we might desire that cannot be produced because of the decision to produce more health care.” Efficiency is highlighted as “A second critical economic concept,” with the policy objective to “maximize the well-being (sometimes referred to as utility) of the members of society collectively,” and with “Cost-benefit and cost-effectiveness analysis” presented as tools that quantify efficiency of policy choices.

### Guidelines for psychological practice for people with low-income and economic marginalization: executive summary [^d35c9f62]. The American Psychologist (2021). High credibility.

LIEM and health disparities—psychologists strive to understand the contribution of economic and social marginalization to the substantial health disparities in our society, noting that strong evidence has developed for a graded-inverse relation between economic status and health and that modern research and theory posit lower socioeconomic status (SES) as a causal and/or exacerbating factor for a spectrum of mental and physical disease. Multidisciplinary efforts have demonstrated that low-income and economic marginalization (LIEM) status contributes to health disparities through four basic categories: substantially greater acute and chronic stress; greater exposure to unhealthy environmental factors; poorer health behaviors; and lower levels of access to quality healthcare. The impact begins early, as growing up in a LIEM household can contribute to lifelong negative health consequences, and the negative impact of these factors is likely cumulative over time.

### Fish, shellfish, and children's health: an assessment of benefits, risks, and sustainability [^1490cdf8]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Table 1—sustainability considerations for seafood: Approximately 30% of global fish stocks are overexploited and a further 60% are harvested at or near their maximum sustainable yield, and medical and governmental organizations have encouraged greater seafood consumption for Americans, which may add pressure to declining wild fisheries and promote unsustainable aquaculture practice. Shrimp is the most commonly consumed seafood in the United States; much of the shrimp comes from highly unsustainable overseas fisheries with heavy environmental and human tolls. US fisheries, wild or farmed, are some of the best managed in the world, even if not all are sustainably harvested, and compared with conventional red meat production in the United States, most wild catch fisheries and best practice aquaculture have favorable water, greenhouse gas, and pollution footprints.

### Testing comparability between retrospective life history data and prospective birth cohort study data [^7700fab6]. The Journals of Gerontology: Series B, Psychological Sciences and Social Sciences (2020). Medium credibility.

Cognition is measured using a standardized summary score ranging from 2 to 52, based on an assessment of memory and executive function. The tests were applied in the same way in NCDS and ELSA. High scores indicate better cognitive function. Memory is assessed through a verbal learning and recall test that asks respondents to recall 10 words immediately and after a short delay. Executive function is assessed through verbal fluency task and through a letter cancellation task. There is a wealth of evidence that supports the notion that childhood social class influences later life cognition when using retrospective recall of early life circumstances, but that it is attenuated by contemporaneous social class and educational attainment (;;).

Home ownership is measured by whether a respondent owned their current occupancy outright or with a mortgage. The question on tenure has the same response options in both studies. Membership of a pension scheme is derived in NCDS by those who report having an employer, private groups personal, stakeholder, retirement annuity or self-invested pension plan and in ELSA by those who report being a member of a pension scheme other than the state pension. Weekly earnings from employment is measured by gross earnings from a current job specified over a period of choice of respondents’ for those working in both NCDS and ELSA. In NCDS, respondents are asked for their gross pay before deductions at the last time they were paid, whereas in ELSA respondents are asked about pay in current job including any overtime or bonuses, but before any deductions for tax, national insurance or pension contributions and union dues. Family savings are derived from the total amount of savings and investments that a respondent and their current partner hold. NCDS respondents are simply asked how much do you and your partner hold in savings and investments. ELSA respondents are asked whether they hold a current account, savings account, tax-free savings and investments, premium bounds, stocks and shares, investment trusts, or bonds and gilts, and then asked the value of each. The measures of weekly earnings and family savings are log transformed in the analysis.

### Developing policy solutions for a more active nation: integrating economic and public health perspectives [^8a3a5bfc]. Preventive Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Both economic and public health/medical perspectives play an important role in the policy process but often approach policy questions in an incompatible way. Harnessing any synergy requires an understanding of the other perspective. We begin by comparing and contrasting the economic and public health perspectives, including introducing relevant economic concepts. We next identify economic considerations for the development of environmental incentives that promote physical activity. We then assess features of the political environment which could impact the success of policy alternatives aimed at increasing physical activity. We conclude with several policy levers that may promote active living. Throughout the manuscript, we use the term economics to refer to classical economics and utility maximization rather than behavioral economics. In addition, we focus mostly on normative economics (which offers prescriptions for what should be done) rather than positive economics (which offers predictions of economic outcomes conditional on various hypothetical scenarios).

### A meta-analysis on the neural basis of planning: activation likelihood estimation of functional brain imaging results in the tower of london task [^ea1de78f]. Human Brain Mapping (2017). Low credibility.

The ability to mentally design and evaluate series of future actions has often been studied in terms of planning abilities, commonly using well-structured laboratory tasks like the Tower of London (ToL). Despite a wealth of studies, findings on the specific localization of planning processes within prefrontal cortex (PFC) and on the hemispheric lateralization are equivocal. Here, we address this issue by integrating evidence from two different sources of data: First, we provide a systematic overview of the existing lesion data on planning in the ToL (10 studies, 211 patients) which does not indicate any evidence for a general lateralization of planning processes in (pre)frontal cortex. Second, we report a quantitative meta-analysis with activation likelihood estimation based on 31 functional neuroimaging datasets on the ToL. Separate meta-analyses of the activation patterns reported for Overall Planning (537 participants) and for Planning Complexity (182 participants) congruently show bilateral contributions of mid-dorsolateral PFC, frontal eye fields, supplementary motor area, precuneus, caudate, anterior insula, and inferior parietal cortex in addition to a left-lateralized involvement of rostrolateral PFC. In contrast to previous attributions of planning-related brain activity to the entire dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) and either its left or right homolog derived from single studies on the ToL, the present meta-analyses stress the pivotal role specifically of the mid-dorsolateral part of PFC (mid-dlPFC), presumably corresponding to Brodmann Areas 46 and 9/46, and strongly argue for a bilateral rather than lateralized involvement of the dlPFC in planning in the ToL.

### Special commentary: balancing benefits and Risks: the case for retinal images to be considered as nonprotected health information for research purposes [^ff624905]. Ophthalmology (2025). High credibility.

American Academy of Ophthalmology Board of Trustees—retinal images in research and HIPAA de-identification are described as follows: Retinal images contain a wealth of clinical information and are used for detecting diseases at an early stage, monitoring disease progression, evaluating treatment effectiveness, identifying clinical endpoints, and guiding individual patient care patterns. For research, collection and aggregation of de-identified retinal images have supported disease screening and surveillance, for example, artificial intelligence devices approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for screening of diabetic retinopathy, and deep learning algorithms to determine disease staging in retinopathy of prematurity. Population estimates cited include that 19.8 million adults had age-related macular degeneration in 2019, 9.6 million adults had diabetic retinopathy in 2021, the prevalence of glaucoma is 3 million adults in the United States, and more than 7 million individuals had vision loss or blindness in their better-seeing eye. HIPAA context is provided: the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA; 45 CFR Parts 160 and 164) restricts use or disclosure of protected health information for research absent patient authorization or an institutional review board waiver. A 2010 National Institute of Standards and Technology Guide included retina scans as an example of a biometric image, although current Department of Health and Human Services guidance regarding de-identification does not specifically include retinal images in the list of individual identifiers and instead lists biometric identifiers including finger and voice prints and full-face photographs and any comparable images. The guidance states that to be considered a biometric identifier the linkage must satisfy all 3 conditions: (1) the images are unique or distinguishing, (2) a naming data source exists that definitely links the de-identified image to the corresponding patient, and (3) a mechanism exists that relates the de-identified image and the identified data source; additionally, the ability to distinguish data is not sufficient to compromise patient privacy in the absence of a readily available naming data source. The page also differentiates retinal from iris images, noting iris images were developed for individual identification, are used by airport screening programs to authenticate identities, and are considered biometric identifiers because they can be linked to a data source that reveals identity. The statement’s stated purpose is to offer a balanced evaluation of the use of retinal images in research and clinical applications and to review both the risks of patient re-identification and the benefits to patients and the public, with the goal to evaluate the balance of disclosure risk against the benefits gained by access to these data.

### Productive ecosystems and the arrow of development [^4458489a]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

As confidence in market efficiency has declined, particularly since the 2008-9 financial crisis, industrial policy has enjoyed somewhat of a global resurgence. Although, there have been clear examples of path-defying changes,, the metrics derived here aim to aid countries or regions to connect their current productive capabilities to future possibilities. In particular, we hope that the Ecosystem metric is helpful to policymakers seeking to analyse the preparedness of a nation or region to move into a new product, or trying to identify key transition sectors which could open up future opportunities. Additionally, policymakers can also use this methodology retrospectively to identify market failures. This is possible by identifying products that had a high likelihood of appearance, but have not yet been observed. Factors that prevented the appearance of these products can then be investigated. While there are clear policy applications for our work, it is also prudent to highlight limitations of the model. Firstly, although an improvement on previous approaches, the predictive power of the model suffers from false positives since many possible jumps are not realised due to external factors. Secondly, evolving production technologies impact the underlying capability requirements of many products, leading to an evolution of Ecosystem matrix over time, albeit at a slow pace. Based on this, and the predictive power of our model over a five-year period, we suggest that this tool is most suited to deliver short to medium term policy insights. Overall, we believe this methodology will be a valuable asset for policymakers.

### An economic framework for understanding physical activity and eating behaviors [^3cd73b33]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

This paper offers an economic framework of human behavior with respect to physical activity and nutrition. Economics offers useful insights into these behaviors because it is the study of how people allocate their scarce resources of time and money to maximize their lifetime happiness. This paper outlines the criteria for policy interventions from an economic perspective and also considers arguments for policy intervention that are not based on economic considerations. The implications of the economic framework are summarized and its limitations are described.

### Lessons from popper for science, paradigm shifts, scientific revolutions and exercise physiology [^b64e0303]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Exercise physiology is more than a discipline of exercise science

Historically speaking, exercise science developed from the discipline of physical education sometime around the 1980s, depending on the country of reference. The initial development of exercise science was framed around five subdisciplines: exercise physiology, motor learning/control/skill acquisition, growth and development, biomechanics, and sport sociology/psychology. These subdisciplines became known as the ‘5 pillars of exercise science’.Today, thanks to decades of continued research and knowledge creation, one could argue, at least in the Australian context, that added pillars have now emerged. From the exercise physiology pillar alone has grown emphases in strength and conditioning, clinical exercise physiology, sports physiology and perhaps others.

The emergence of exercise physiology as a discipline of exercise science does not mean that exercise physiology is confined to exercise science. For more than 100 years, researchers have investigated human and animal physiological responses to exercise stress. Such research has been pursued by metabolic biochemists, specialist physiologists (eg, cardiovascular, pulmonary, neural, endocrine, muscle, bone and so on), clinicians (cardiologists, pulmonologists, physiotherapists, nutritionists, oncologists, epidemiologists and so on) and of course exercise scientists. The rich multidisciplinary input and applications of exercise physiology have been major factors in the rapid growth of knowledge, and as with all disciplines of science, no topic is owned by any one discipline. The fact that this manuscript is partly in response to work done by a cardiologist interested in a diverse array of human physiological enquiry during exercise stress is testament to this fact.

### Projected landscape-scale repercussions of global action for climate and biodiversity protection [^f6e76825]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

MAgPIE

The Model of Agricultural Production and its Impact on the Environment (MAgPIE) is a global, multiregional land-system model, developed to assess global land-use dynamics and their associated consequences for sustainable development until the end of the 21st century,. It uses a recursive dynamic cost optimisation approach under biophysical and socio-economic constraints to spatially allocate production to meet the demand for food, feed, bioenergy and biomass for other material uses. Dominant cost types include factor requirement costs (capital, labour, fertiliser etc.), land conversion costs, transportation costs to the closest market, investment costs for increasing agricultural productivity (technological change) and costs for irrigation. Spatially explicit biophysical constraints are derived from simulated data from the dynamic global vegetation, crop and hydrology model LPJmL at a spatial resolution of 0.5 degrees (latitude/longitude) driven by a historical climate data time series. Carbon stocks (vegetation, litter and soil) and natural water availability are simulated using LPJmL4, whereas crop irrigation water requirements and yield patterns (crop and grassland) are derived using LPJmL5 simulations, with unlimited N supply. The input data at 0.5 degree resolution are clustered following the approach described by Dietrich et al.and averaged using a smooth spline over the simulated time series. To match crop-specific FAO production levels at the regional scale, averaged yield patterns are calibrated at the cluster scale. The area potentially suitable for cropland was derived from Zabel et al.and adjusted by excluding the lowest tertile (suitability index <13) of marginal land (suitability index between 0 and 33). Socio-economic constraints such as trade patterns and interest rates are defined at the scale of twelve model regions, in which large economies are resolved individually, while smaller economies are grouped together. MAgPIE represents all major crop and livestock types, non-food agricultural commodities, as well as supply chain losses. Land competition is based on cost-effectiveness between crop and livestock production and land-based climate-change mitigation options. Food demand projections are estimated based on population growth, change of demographic structure and per-capita income. The food demand model(Fig. 1) draws on anthropometric and econometric approaches to determine the distribution of undernutrition, overnutrition and obesity, as well as body height by country, age-cohort, and sex. It also separates food waste and food intake of four major food items: staple calories, animal-source calories, calories from fruits, vegetables and nuts, as well as empty calories. All elasticity parameters of the food demand model are derived from past observed data. Greenhouse gas emissions from land use include carbon and nitrogen-related emissions from managed soils and animal waste management. Nitrogen-related emissions are estimated based on a nitrogen budget approach, while carbon exchange with the atmosphere is calculated as the difference in carbon stocks due to land-cover changes between simulated time steps. This model version also accounts for depreciation and new investments in capital stocks for crop production in each time step. This setting favours locations where crops have historically been grown, improving spatially-explicit crop-related outputs and slowing down the free relocation of production to locations with better climatic conditions but with no existing infrastructure.

### Exploring the biophysical option space for feeding the world without deforestation [^15b43dab]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

Safeguarding the world's remaining forests is a high-priority goal. We assess the biophysical option space for feeding the world in 2050 in a hypothetical zero-deforestation world. We systematically combine realistic assumptions on future yields, agricultural areas, livestock feed and human diets. For each scenario, we determine whether the supply of crop products meets the demand and whether the grazing intensity stays within plausible limits. We find that many options exist to meet the global food supply in 2050 without deforestation, even at low crop-yield levels. Within the option space, individual scenarios differ greatly in terms of biomass harvest, cropland demand and grazing intensity, depending primarily on the quantitative and qualitative aspects of human diets. Grazing constraints strongly limit the option space. Without the option to encroach into natural or semi-natural land, trade volumes will rise in scenarios with globally converging diets, thereby decreasing the food self-sufficiency of many developing regions.

### Expert recommendations for the diagnosis, treatment, and management of adult B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia in Latin America [^cee9f9b7]. JCO Global Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

Epidemiology

There are scarce epidemiologic data on ALL in LA. Still, retrospective studies indicate that ALL may be more prevalent in people of LA descent than in the United States and Europe. The US's SEER Program reported a frequency of 18 cases per million for all ages and races. However, in the Latin population in the United States, the proportion increased significantly to 26.6 cases per million.A global analysis found the highest incidence of leukemia in Hispanic people, with 35 cases per million.Data suggest that the rate has been increasing rapidly over time and a worse prognosis was observed when compared with other ethnic groups. The underlying cause for this is unknown although several hypotheses exist, including socioeconomic disparities, environmental risks, and genetic variants.-

The lack of regional data on ALL reflects the methodology used in the public health registries, where data are either lacking or only provided as a histopathologic diagnosis. A study of over 1,000 adults in LA with leukemia diagnosed by multiparametric flow cytometry (MFC) found that 519 patients were diagnosed with leukemia (51%). Of those, 486 patients (93.6%) had B-cell lineage.Transplant data may support the hypothesis that ALL is more prevalent in LA. For instance, a comparison of patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplants (allo-HSCT) because of ALL in LA (27%) was higher than those in Europe (16%). More regional data are crucial to determine the actual prevalence of ALL, understand the disease behavior, and improve regional patient outcomes.

Access to Testing

Geography, natural resources, politics, development, racial and ethnic representation, education, wealth distribution, and health care are diverse in LA.20%-66% of LA residents face health care barriers like long wait times, geographical distances, availability, accessibility, and convenience.In LA and the Caribbean, the percentage of the gross domestic product (GDP) invested in health care is less than half that of the US level.

Access to adequate diagnosis and treatment of ALL is often challenging in LA. A survey conducted by the American Society for Hematology and LA Hematology societies showed that countries in LA have heterogeneous access, which varies according to whether the patient has public or private health insurance.Basic treatment is generally guaranteed. However, high-cost therapies and medications like monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) and allo-HSCTare often inaccessible. In some cases, sponsored programs from the pharmaceutical industry fund these therapies, providing a short-term solution to access.

### Guidelines for psychological practice for people with low-income and economic marginalization: executive summary [^1209bb45]. The American Psychologist (2021). High credibility.

Research and training inclusivity—raising students’ awareness of socioeconomic status (SES) concerns in research can be very valuable and might involve reading relevant literature or integrating such issues into research methods courses. Teaching students how to effectively measure SES can be quite useful, with Best Practices in Conceptualizing and Measuring Social Class in Psychological Research cited as an excellent starting point, and students are advised to choose measures informed by the type of social class information sought. Students might also strive to be aware of cultural sensitivity and the potential for exploitation when studying economically marginalized populations, noting that financial incentives and power differentials may be more likely to have an adverse impact on the economically marginalized.

### Guidelines for psychological practice for people with low-income and economic marginalization: executive summary [^d408850a]. The American Psychologist (2021). High credibility.

Low-income and economic marginalization (LIEM)—associations between socioeconomic status (SES) and behavioral, mental, and physical health are described as well-documented, and poverty has been identified as the most pervasive risk to the health of children in America. Needs and desires of LIEM populations are described as often neglected or ignored, with distancing identified as a key factor in classist beliefs and classism defined as cognitive and behavioral distancing from people who are poor. Classist attitudes are defined as assignment of characteristics of worth and ability to individuals based on their known or perceived social class, with stigma occurring as microaggressions and more affluent individuals blaming social class circumstances on perceived faulty or deficient attributes of poor individuals. This process of blame is described as preserving a social system that benefits those in power while creating obstacles that marginalize and exploit poor and working-class populations, and negative views are used as justification for inequities in education, healthcare, the justice system, the environment, and access to a vocation that provides a living wage. The Western value of meritocracy is described as reinforcing biased and negative views toward people living in poverty, contributing to greater distancing and endorsement of system-justifying ideologies that can lead to internalized self-blame among people who are targets of classism, and when LIEM populations are made visible, it is often in a negative light.

### Crop rotations synergize yield, nutrition, and revenue: a meta-analysis [^fd7da773]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

In conclusion, our study demonstrates that various types of crop rotation positively impact production, income, and nutrition, highlighting the role of crop diversification in enhancing food security. Furthermore, we were able to identify specific beneficial crop rotations in different global major agricultural producing regions offering actionable guidance for sustainable food and nutrition and income security. Notably, there is potential to close yield gaps with non-legume rotations in high-input systems, while legume rotations are more beneficial in resource-constrained farming. However, widespread adoption remains a challenge, particularly in the Global South, where economic constraints and agronomic uncertainties limit implementation. To overcome these barriers, integrating agricultural crop diversification into national policies and fostering collaboration among stakeholders is essential. This approach can reduce reliance on synthetic inputs, lower environmental impacts, and combat “hidden hunger”. Ultimately, regionally adapted and field-tested crop rotations under real-farming situations can play a pivotal role in securing food and nutrition, increasing farm profitability, and advancing global sustainability goals,.

### Fish, shellfish, and children's health: an assessment of benefits, risks, and sustainability [^0e085177]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Aquaculture sustainability compared with beef, poultry, and pork—on a per-calorie basis, beef is described as most resource intensive: “it takes about 10 times more irrigated water and 4 times more nitrogen fertilizer and produces about 10 times more greenhouse gas emissions when compared with pork or poultry.” Shrimp supply to the United States largely comes from Southeast Asia and can be highly carbon intensive, as “Shrimp eaten in America mostly comes from Southeast Asian nations (Indonesia, India, and Thailand, in particular)” and “Shrimp sourced from these regions can have a carbon footprint an order of magnitude greater than beef.” For salmon, “Fifty percent or more of salmon is farm raised,” often from “Canada, Chile, or Norway,” and studies report a footprint “of approximately 2 kg carbon dioxide equivalent/1000 kcal salmon, which is similar to pork or poultry.”

### Optimal coding and neuronal adaptation in economic decisions [^9e3845d2]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

During economic decisions, offer value cells in orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) encode the values of offered goods. Furthermore, their tuning functions adapt to the range of values available in any given context. A fundamental and open question is whether range adaptation is behaviorally advantageous. Here we present a theory of optimal coding for economic decisions. We propose that the representation of offer values is optimal if it ensures maximal expected payoff. In this framework, we examine offer value cells in non-human primates. We show that their responses are quasi-linear even when optimal tuning functions are highly non-linear. Most importantly, we demonstrate that for linear tuning functions range adaptation maximizes the expected payoff. Thus value coding in OFC is functionally rigid (linear tuning) but parametrically plastic (range adaptation with optimal gain). Importantly, the benefit of range adaptation outweighs the cost of functional rigidity. While generally suboptimal, linear tuning may facilitate transitive choices.

### Socio-economic factors associated with open defecation among agricultural households: a cross-sectional study in Haiti [^bab1a28b]. BMJ Public Health (2023). High credibility.

Previous empirical studies on OD both in South Asia and Africa have identified sociocultural and sociodemographic factors as the key drivers of OD. Efforts to reduce OD often face sociocultural barriers, particularly in low-income and middle-income countries.These barriers connect community characteristics to individual behaviours, particularly when there is social pressure that can create compliance to local non-sanitary rules of behaviour.Empirical studies conducted in India, Nepal and sub-Saharan Africa have confirmed the links between sociocultural norms and OD.

Recent research in Haiti has shown empirical association between access to the media and OD.In the literature, there is a variety of OD determinants, including: norms of latrine use,preferences to defecate in the open instead of using a latrine,cultural beliefs,age,household wealth status,household size,education of the household head,etc. An important part of the literature have also shown that defecating in the open occurs predominantly in rural environments.Researchers argue that in rural areas, households engaged in agricultural activities are more likely to practice OD since they spend most of their time outdoorsbut they do not focus specifically on agricultural households and their characteristics. Such study calling attention to agricultural households did not bring any evidence about OD among this part of the population. Between the fertilisation utility of OD and its menace for health, there is an open debate initiated in Africa,but it is still underdocumented for Haiti. Defecating in the field while doing agricultural activities is a major problem for the quality of products harvested with soil contact. When agricultural household is defecating in the open, it is a bigger and critical community issue. It remains necessary to go further by studying agricultural households’ OD practice more specifically.

### A behavioral approach to instability pathways in financial markets [^c8c8af07]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Discussion

In a highly interconnected financial system, it is of paramount relevance to detect the emergence of an abrupt transition from a stable configuration to a state of instability,–. It is against this background that our results are derived in the context of a financial market in which we investigate how the effects of linkages at the micro-level may bring changes to the macro-system. The level of connectivity influences the probability of the system to remain stable. However, the role played by connectivity depends also on how the structure of the network interacts with additional factors which are specific for financial markets, such as investors heterogeneity, incentives to misbehave and price changes.

In this work, we have introduced an indicator that aims at detecting the emergence of instabilities in financial markets. The absence of a unified quantitative framework to properly formalize the laws of motion of financial markets motivates the use of instruments derived from the network theory to detect the emergence of discontinuities and their temporal evolution. Changes in the market conditions are inspected through the analysis of the underlying system at different points in time. Phases of market instability are then assessed by the changes in the structure of the interactions among stock returns.

In particular, we have identified phases of accumulation of instability by detecting the emergence of a sub-graph of stocks characterized by both high cohesiveness among its members and long-range memory, which we relate to herding behaviors and positive feedbacks. We summarize the dynamic of this sub-graph through a synthetic indicator which we show to be able to detect temporary transitions of the underlying system. To test this approach, we have also proposed illustrative investment strategies to identify the emergence of up and down market phases according to the signals provided by the indicator. Our results show that this methodology can timely recognize phases of increasing instability that are likely to drive the underlying system into a new market configuration.

### Afforestation or intense pasturing improve the ecological and economic value of abandoned tropical farmlands [^a38f9166]. Nature Communications (2014). Medium credibility.

Decreasing agricultural yields and increasing national and global competitionforce farmers to abandon less productive lands and either clear more pristine forest for agriculture or give up agriculture as the basis of their livelihoods. Reclaiming abandoned areas to resume production is rarely considered a worthwhile alternative. Field et al.estimated that 386 M ha of abandoned lands worldwide have the potential for renewed productive use.

Re-utilization could not only mitigate the increasing pressures on natural forest, but could also help to alleviate poverty by improving food security, to promote rural socio-economic developmentand to lower rural outmigration. Sustainability research must, therefore, investigate strategies to recover abandoned lands.

Existing approaches to the problem of restoration have largely been focused on afforestation attempts and either their ecological, economicor socialconsequences. A more holistic, but thus far unrealized, ideal of research into the benefits humans receive from ecosystems should provide biophysically realistic ecosystem data and models, consider local trade-offs, recognize off-site effects and involve stakeholders. Moreover, to promote sustainable future land use, not only afforestation but also restoration of agricultural potential should be considered. Consequently, scientifically responsible decision support requires multidisciplinary long-term research that supports reliable parameterization of customized models.

### Impact of small farmers' access to improved seeds and deforestation in DR Congo [^09a95a00]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

An important contribution of the study is to demonstrate the value of distinguishing between primary and secondary forest deforestation. The distinction both reflects decision-making at the household level and has major ramifications for biodiversity. Tropical forests support at least two-thirds of the world’s biodiversityon less than 10% of Earth’s land surface. Primary forest, in particular, is critical for maintaining much of the world’s biodiversity –. Species abundance and uniqueness are often much lower in secondary than in primary forest,. And while ecosystem service provision and ecosystem recovery in secondary forest is an active area of research,, it is well recognized that primary forest provide specific habitat types and characteristics that are not present in secondary forest. Many species are dependent on these unique properties and cannot survive without it. Hence deforestation of primary forest leads to irreversible losses in biodiversity.

Distinguishing between deforestation from primary and secondary forest hence is key to understanding the environmental trade-offs involved with agricultural intensification practices. While modern crop varieties have a large potential to improve livelihoods, the tension with possible negative effects on environmental outcomes needs to be considered in nuanced and context-specific ways. Our results show that improving access to modern cereal varieties in the Congo Basin, in the absence of accompanying policies to improve soil fertility management, may have a high cost for biodiversity due to its effects on the primary forest.

The distinction between forest types can also be important for understanding the carbon sequestration implications of deforestation. While secondary forest can sequester atmospheric CO 2 10–20 times faster than primary forest,, there is also large heterogeneity in carbon sequestration in secondary forest, as it varies with the age of the secondary forest, land-use history, number of times cleared, soil fertility, forest type, fragmentation, etc.In specific instances, average carbon in the secondary forest can be much lower than in primary forest. Overall, the trade-offs in terms of carbon sequestration deserve further research.

### Options for reforming agricultural subsidies from health, climate, and economic perspectives [^7cf99d9a]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Agricultural subsidies are an important factor for influencing food production and therefore part of a food system that is seen as neither healthy nor sustainable. Here we analyse options for reforming agricultural subsidies in line with health and climate-change objectives on one side, and economic objectives on the other. Using an integrated modelling framework including economic, environmental, and health assessments, we find that on a global scale several reform options could lead to reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and improvements in population health without reductions in economic welfare. Those include a repurposing of up to half of agricultural subsidies to support the production of foods with beneficial health and environmental characteristics, including fruits, vegetables, and other horticultural products, and combining such repurposing with a more equal distribution of subsidy payments globally. The findings suggest that reforming agricultural subsidy schemes based on health and climate-change objectives can be economically feasible and contribute to transitions towards healthy and sustainable food systems.

### Global and regional drivers of land-use emissions in 1961-2017 [^0a34f575]. Nature (2021). Excellent credibility.

Historically, human uses of land have transformed and fragmented ecosystems 1,2 , degraded biodiversity 3,4 , disrupted carbon and nitrogen cycles 5,6 and added prodigious quantities of greenhouse gases (GHGs) to the atmosphere 7,8 . However, in contrast to fossil-fuel carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions, trends and drivers of GHG emissions from land management and land-use change (together referred to as 'land-use emissions') have not been as comprehensively and systematically assessed. Here we present country-, process-, GHG- and product-specific inventories of global land-use emissions from 1961 to 2017, we decompose key demographic, economic and technical drivers of emissions and we assess the uncertainties and the sensitivity of results to different accounting assumptions. Despite steady increases in population (+144 per cent) and agricultural production per capita (+58 per cent), as well as smaller increases in emissions per land area used (+8 per cent), decreases in land required per unit of agricultural production (-70 per cent) kept global annual land-use emissions relatively constant at about 11 gigatonnes CO 2 -equivalent until 2001. After 2001, driven by rising emissions per land area, emissions increased by 2.4 gigatonnes CO 2 -equivalent per decade to 14.6 gigatonnes CO 2 -equivalent in 2017 (about 25 per cent of total anthropogenic GHG emissions). Although emissions intensity decreased in all regions, large differences across regions persist over time. The three highest-emitting regions (Latin America, Southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa) dominate global emissions growth from 1961 to 2017, driven by rapid and extensive growth of agricultural production and related land-use change. In addition, disproportionate emissions are related to certain products: beef and a few other red meats supply only 1 per cent of calories worldwide, but account for 25 per cent of all land-use emissions. Even where land-use change emissions are negligible or negative, total per capita CO 2 -equivalent land-use emissions remain near 0.5 tonnes per capita, suggesting the current frontier of mitigation efforts. Our results are consistent with existing knowledge-for example, on the role of population and economic growth and dietary choice-but provide additional insight into regional and sectoral trends.

### Dynamics of cooperation in concurrent games [^3ea90700]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Computational methods used for the figures

For the simulations in the main text, we use the following default parameters. The benefits in the two games areand, respectively, and the cost is c = 1. In addition, we neglect any trembling-hand (implementation) errors, ε TH = 0.

In Fig. 2 a–c we show average trajectories. To this end, we have run 100 independent simulations for each treatment. To keep timescales comparable, simulations are run for 20,000 elementary time steps in the control treatment, and for 40,000 elementary time steps in the other two treatments. This implies that there are 5000 updating events per player and game on average in each treatment. In Fig. 2 d and e, we display which strategies cooperative players tend to use. To this end, we use the data of the simulations in Fig. 2 a–c. We define a player’s strategy to be cooperative if the player’s cooperation rate in each game is at least 2/3 against the given co-player (other cut-offs give similar results). The panel then shows the arithmetic mean of all strategies classified as cooperative. Finally, Fig. 2 g, h shows the impact of the benefit of cooperation in the high game. Here, each point corresponds to the time average of one long simulation (10 6 time steps). We explore the impact of other model parameters in Fig. S3.

In Fig. 3, we explore four model extensions that describe the impact of different cognitive constraints and heuristics. The top row in Fig. 3 describes how the evolving cooperation rates are affected as we change the probability ε IR of experiencing imperfect recall (Fig. 3 a), the probability ε SP of experiencing a spillover (Fig. 3 b), the weight κ that measures the strength of preferential updating (Fig. 3 c), and the likelihood λ that a player engages in narrow bracketing (Fig. 3 d). Each data point is the average of a simulation run for 10 6 updating steps. The middle and the bottom row of the figure show the player’s average strategies. This figure is based on all strategies used during the simulation (not only the cooperative strategies). For a more detailed discussion of each model extension, see Supporting Information.

### Women's empowerment and male involvement in antenatal care: analyses of demographic and health surveys (DHS) in selected African countries [^b499047f]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2014). Low credibility.

Explanatory variable

Women’s empowerment was measured as a composite score, ranging from 0 to 9, where 0 represents “not empowered” and 9 represents “highly empowered”. Three dimensions were included based on available DHS items: economic, socio-familial, and legal. Each woman’s score was calculated from the sum of 9 individual questions scored 0 (=not empowered) or 1 (=empowered). Table 1 summarizes the aggregation rules used to code the more empowered response of each question. Using the framework proposed by Malhotra et al. the empowerment dimensions and their respective items were conceptualized as follows: Economic empowerment referred to access to and control over economic resources and participation in economic markets. The dimension was examined using one question concerning women’s income relative to her partner (code = 1 if more, about the same, or woman is sole earner; code = 0 if less than partner or women/neither earn cash) and three questions relating to decisions on the woman’s income, partner’s income, or household purchases (code = 1 if woman decides alone or jointly; code = 0 if partner decides).

### Glucagon, from past to present: a century of intensive research and controversies [^dafef81b]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2023). High credibility.

2022 corresponds to the 100th anniversary of the discovery of glucagon. This TimeCapsule aims to recall the main steps leading to the discovery, characterisation, and clinical importance of the so-called second pancreatic hormone. We describe the early historical findings in basic research (ie, discovery, purification, structure, α-cell origin, radioimmunoassay, glucagon gene [GCG], and glucagon receptor [GLR]), in which three future Nobel Prize laureates were actively involved. Considered as an anti-insulin hormone, glucagon was rapidly used to treat insulin-induced hypoglycaemic coma episodes in people with type 1 diabetes. A key step in the story of glucagon was the discovery of its role and the role of α cells in the physiology and pathophysiology (ie, paracrinopathy) of type 2 diabetes. This concept led to the design of different strategies targeting glucagon, among which GLP-1 receptor (GLP1R) agonists were a major breakthrough, and combination of inhibition of glucagon secretion with stimulation of insulin secretion (both in a glucose-dependent manner). Taking advantage of the glucagon-induced increase in energy metabolism, biased coagonists were developed. Besides the GLP-1 receptor, these coagonists also target the glucagon receptor to further promote weight loss. Thus, the 100-year story of glucagon has most probably not come to an end.

### Economics and physical activity: a research agenda [^7ff7213b]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Both economic and public health/medical perspectives play an important role in the policy process, but often approach policy questions in an incompatible way. Economics and public health perspectives can complement each other, although harnessing any synergy requires an understanding of the other perspective. This article contrasts the two perspectives and reviews existing economic research in physical activity. Much effort has gone into producing cost-of-illness numbers or cost-offset claims with limited value from an economic perspective, although some simple steps could make them more informative. A more notable advance for active living research would be the adoption of standardized cost-effectiveness analysis methods, even just as an add-on to ongoing intervention trials. Probably the most challenging and exciting area, however, is the emerging research on the interaction between environmental incentives and physical activity. An economic perspective with its explicit focus on market failures is an important complement to ongoing active living research as policymakers in the United States are more likely to rely on the market to solve policy problems than on regulation. It is imperative to understand how the market works in actuality, not in the abstract, an area wide open for empirical research.

### How leisure activities affect health: a narrative review and multi-level theoretical framework of mechanisms of action [^72bc8e4a]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2021). High credibility.

Finally, although this framework brings together a large number of potential mechanisms of action, it is not, and could never be, complete.There might be mechanisms of action that have not yet been identified, or that might not yet exist but could still emerge as patterns of leisure activities and behaviours evolve. Further, many of the mechanisms activated by leisure engagement will not be unique to leisure, but will also be activated by non-leisure activities in everyday life. Consequently, as each mechanism of action itself is also the individual subject of ongoing research, both in relation to leisure activities and to broader activities, our conceptual understanding of these mechanisms is constantly evolving.

Box 3-4. Population-level versus patient-level decisions about asthma treatment—population-level selection states that when choosing between treatment options at a population level (e.g., national formularies, health maintenance organizations, national guidelines), the ‘preferred’ medication at each step is the best treatment for most patients, based on efficacy, effectiveness, safety, and availability and cost at the population level, mainly based on evidence about symptoms and exacerbations (from randomized controlled trials, pragmatic studies and strong observational data). For Steps 1–5, there are different population-level recommendations by age-group (adults/adolescents, children 6–11 years, children 5 years and younger), and in Step 5, there are also different population-level recommendations depending on the inflammatory phenotype, Type 2 or non-Type 2.

### Wheat and maize flour fortification: practical recommendations for national application [^85d7e529]. CDC (2008). Medium credibility.

Recommendations for wheat and maize flour fortification—policy framing and conditions—“Wheat and maize flour fortification is a preventive food-based approach to improve micronutrient status of populations over time” that “can be integrated to other interventions.” Fortification of other vehicles “should also be considered when feasible.” Wheat and maize flour fortification “should be considered when industrially produced flour is regularly consumed by large population groups in a country,” and programmes “could be expected to be most effective in achieving a public health impact if mandated at the national level and can help achieve international public health goals.”

### High economic costs of reduced carbon sinks and declining biome stability in central American forests [^b1140de7]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

For the valuation of habitat services, we used a benefit transfer approach. While this approach is not without its caveats, it represented the most suitable option for our case due to a lack of primary studies in our study region and a lack of resources to conduct our own analysis. To reduce uncertainties and biases related to specific study settings, we aimed to include a broad database and approximate a central estimate irrespective of the underlying ecosystem. This is also in line with our biodiversity conservation perspective and preferrable to other strategies of unit value transfer. Also, this approach avoids the pitfalls of assigning values by habitat type, which may result in a habitat “ranking” and economic implications that are counter-productive for the conservation of species. Therefore, we searched the Ecosystem Service Valuation Database, which is currently the largest compilation of ES value estimates from more than 950 studies. Within this database estimates for our study region were still very scarce, hence we extended the data selection to the tropics (South America, Africa and Asia). We further cleaned the data by removing rows with missing entries and duplicates and selected only values within the 5–95% quantile due to the presence of extreme outliers from 0 to 2.25e + 10 $/ha/year. While we aimed to include a broad spectrum of ES that are supported through habitat services, we excluded climate regulation (for obvious reasons) and also provisioning services (food, raw materials, water, medicinal resources) from the data set. The latter was done for two reasons: firstly, our simulations focused on natural forests and did not include forest management and secondly, a high and still growing share of forest products is obtained from plantations,, whereas natural forests are mainly valued for regulating, cultural and supporting services. The thus obtained data selection comprised 246 records (for a summary and overview over applied filters see Supplement, Table S7). However, the data showed a strong bias towards tropical rain forest ecosystems. To account for the variety of ecosystems in the study region and arrive at a more general estimate, we grouped all estimates by major biomes (tropical rain forest, tropical dry forest, montane forests, temperate forests and grassland), computed average values for each ecosystem service by biome and summed the results for each biome (similar to the total economic value framework). Finally, we used the average across these biomes and inflation-corrected the value to the year 2015 as baseline for valuing habitat services. For the variants with discounting, we prolongated this baseline value for the historical period (central year 1999, Eq. 2) and discounted it for the future period (central year 2085, Eq. 3).where HSV = habitat service value and d = discount rate

### Household air pollution interventions to improve health in low-and middle-income countries: an official American Thoracic Society research statement [^ec650563]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Consensus development and literature search—four separate virtual meetings were held, and consensus was defined as at least 80% participation in each recommendation with a minimum 70% threshold for agreement. Electronic searches were conducted using Ovid MEDLINE (1946 to present), Embase.com (1947 to present), Web of Science (1900 to present), and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) via Ovid (1991 to present), with searches run in March 2022. The strategy incorporated controlled vocabulary and free-text synonyms for the concepts of household, health, clean energy, pollutants, energy uses, LMICs, and interventions, no restrictions on language or other search filters were applied, and studies were deduplicated in EndNote then uploaded into Covidence. The 1,387 retrieved publications from the literature search returned a broad variety.

### Trade-offs between multifunctionality and profit in tropical smallholder landscapes [^1b21e550]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Our study region is both a global biodiversity hotspot and a showcase of ongoing agricultural expansion by formal (i.e. transmigration until the 1990s) and informal (i.e. occupation) land-use transitions: between 1990 and 2013, rainforest land cover in Jambi Province decreased from 49.5% to 34.5%, whereas the land under rubber and oil palm cultivation increased from 26.4% to 32.5% (Fig. 1). Losses in rainforest cover primarily amounted to transformation to rubber and oil palm plantations, other agricultural land uses, and shrub, i.e. land after deforestation that is usually converted to plantations after few years of fallow (Fig. 1 ; Supplementary Table 1). By 2017, 99% of the land under rubber and ~61% of the land under oil palm in Jambi was cultivated by smallholders. Moreover, jungle rubber, a traditional agroforestry system of rubber-enriched disturbed or secondary forests, which was formerly the main rubber production system in the region, has become economically marginal owing to its low returns to land and labor (Supplementary Table 2), resulting in its conversion to more-profitable rubber and oil palm monocultures. To understand the economic–ecological trade-offs of these smallholder land-use transitions from lowland rainforest to jungle rubber agroforestry and intensive rubber and oil palm monocultures, we (1) conduct extensive ecological and socioeconomic field studies, (2) including continuous records of rubber and oil palm yields in the same study plots over a 2-year period, and (3) derive yield–profit relationships based on the management practices of 700 smallholder farm households in our study region. We focus on profits as these can be expressed per unit of land, and profits are positively associated with other economic and human welfare dimensions in our study system, such as household incomes, food security, and consumption expenditures of smallholders,. Furthermore, to resolve spatial landscape planning and the underlying political drivers of land-use transformation, we conduct 150 stakeholder interviews with government representatives, NGOs and corporate actors at district, provincial, and national level. We find that smallholder land-use transitions from forest and agroforestry systems to rubber and oil palm monocultures generally result in substantial economic–ecological trade-offs. Increases in profits of farmers occur at the cost of massive losses in biodiversity and of key ecosystem functions, indicating far-reaching ecosystem deterioration. Although some trade-offs may be mitigated under optimal land-use allocation, our findings question the long-term sustainability of ongoing economic development in this global biodiversity hotspot. Changes in economic incentive structures through well-designed policies are urgently needed.

### Physical therapy evaluation and treatment after concussion / mild traumatic brain injury [^f3345263]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2020). High credibility.

Concussion clinical practice guideline recommendation grading—definitions and levels of obligation—are provided for grades A–F. Grade A (Strong evidence) is supported by “a preponderance of level I and/or level II studies” and “This must include at least 1 level I study,” with obligation statements: “Should: benefits substantially outweigh harms,” “May: benefits minimally outweigh harms or benefit-harm ratio is value dependent,” “Should not: harms minimally or moderately outweigh benefits or evidence of no effect,” and “Must not: harms largely outweigh benefits.” Grade B (Moderate evidence) is defined as “A single high-quality randomized controlled trial or a preponderance of level II studies support the recommendation,” with obligations: “Should: benefits substantially outweigh harms,” “May: benefits moderately or minimally outweigh harms or benefit-harm ratio is value dependent,” “Should not: evidence that harms outweigh benefits or evidence of no effect,” and “Must not: harms largely outweigh benefits.” Grade C (Weak evidence) is “A single level II study or a preponderance of level III and IV studies, including statements of consensus by content experts, support the recommendation,” with obligations: “Should: benefits substantially outweigh harms,” “May: benefits moderately or minimally outweigh harms or benefit-harm ratio is value dependent,” and “Should not: harms minimally or moderately outweigh benefits.” Grade D (Conflicting evidence) states “Higher-quality studies conducted on this topic disagree with respect to their conclusions. The recommendation is based on these conflicting studies,” with obligation “May: conflicting evidence; the benefit-harm ratio is value dependent.” Grade E (Theoretical/ foundational evidence) is “A preponderance of evidence from animal or cadaver studies, from conceptual models/principles, or from basic sciences/bench research support this conclusion,” with obligations “May: in the absence of evidence from clinical studies, theoretical and/or foundational evidence supports benefit” and “Should not: in the absence of evidence from clinical studies, theoretical and/or foundational evidence suggests risk of harm.” Grade F (Expert opinion) is “Best practice based on the clinical experience of the GDG,” with obligations “Must: strongly supported by consensus-based best practice/standard of care,” “Should: moderately supported by best practice/standard of care,” “May: supported by expert opinion in the absence of consensus,” “Should not: best practice/standard of care indicates potential harms,” and “Must not: potential harms are strongly supported by consensus-based best practice/standard of care.”

### Economic cost of U.S. suicide and nonfatal self-harm [^c62275fb]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

The average annual economic cost of medical spending, lost work, lower quality of life, and avoidable deaths from U.S. suicide and nonfatal self-harm using national data sources was $510B. This estimate is higher than a previous similar estimate of $94B based on an older version of the same data source.The present study used more recent and comprehensive estimates of attributable medical spending, lost work costs, and measured economic costs during a period of higher incidence. However, the higher estimate presented here is primarily due to a change in CDC WISQARS Cost of Injury to value premature mortality and morbidity using VSL instead of lost labor market productivity; VSL is approximately 10 times more than foregone employment compensation.Higher or lower total annual VSL in this study’s results reflects the age distribution among individuals who died by suicide because VSL varies by age in the data source. Like previous reporting, this study’s results highlight that suicides declined for the older working age population (45–64 year old) during the COVID-19 pandemic year of 2020.This study identifies that nonfatal self-harm costs also decreased for both that age group and younger working ages (25–44 year old) that year.

Limitations

This study had several limitations. The economic cost presented here is underestimated; third-party costs are not included in VSL estimates of avoidable mortality, nonfatal self-harm costs addressed only the first year following ED-treated injuries, and other elements of the economic cost such as increased risk of suicide among family members were not addressed in the data source.Suicide deaths may be undercounted in official mortality statistics and self-harm injuries may be undercounted in sources based on clinical diagnoses. Medical spending represents financial costs to specific, identifiable payers (including individual persons, health insurance payers, and employers) but most of the economic cost presented here comes from healthy life year losses based on VSL. The value of what is lost in quality and number of life years is not completely identifiable through financial transactions and thus not as visible as direct costs such as medical spending or employer costs from lost work productivity. The relationship between VSL and age (in particular, VSL for older adults) is likely more complex than is applied in the data source used for this study.

### Global biodiversity loss from outsourced deforestation [^a9748725]. Nature (2025). Excellent credibility.

Globalization increasingly allows countries to externalize the environmental costs of land use, including biodiversity loss 1 . So far, we have a very incomplete understanding of how countries cause biodiversity loss outside their own borders through their demand for agricultural and forestry products grown in other countries 2 . Here we quantify the global range losses to forest vertebrates from 2001 to 2015 caused by deforestation attributable to 24 developed countries by means of their consumption of products obtained through global supply chains. We show that these driver countries are responsible for much greater cumulative range loss to species outside their own borders than within them. These international impacts were concentrated geographically, allowing us to map global hotspots of outsourced losses of biodiversity. Countries had the greatest external impacts on species occurring in nearby regions. However, in a few cases, developed countries also inflicted disproportionate harm on vertebrates in distant countries.

### A computational theory of the subjective experience of flow [^8fc4ed10]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Flow is a subjective state characterized by immersion and engagement in one's current activity. The benefits of flow for productivity and health are well-documented, but a rigorous description of the flow-generating process remains elusive. Here we develop and empirically test a theory of flow's computational substrates: the informational theory of flow. Our theory draws on the concept of mutual information, a fundamental quantity in information theory that quantifies the strength of association between two variables. We propose that the mutual information between desired end states and means of attaining them - [Formula: see text] - gives rise to flow. We support our theory across five experiments (four preregistered) by showing, across multiple activities, that increasing [Formula: see text] increases flow and has important downstream benefits, including enhanced attention and enjoyment. We rule out alternative constructs including alternative metrics of associative strength, psychological constructs previously shown to predict flow, and various forms of instrumental value.

### An official American Thoracic Society workshop report: developing performance measures from clinical practice guidelines [^7deadca8]. Annals of the American Thoracic Society (2014). Medium credibility.

GRADE recommendation strength—“Strong recommendations can be made when there is moderate- or high-quality evidence” that “the net benefits of the intervention clearly outweigh the net harms,” and “can also be made even if the level of evidence is poor but values and preferences strongly support the action.” Strong recommendations mean “there is certainty that the desirable consequences of the intervention exceed the undesirable consequences,” that further research is unlikely to change certainty, and that “nearly all patients would desire the intervention when given the choice.” In contrast, “weak recommendations are common, reflecting residual uncertainty about the quality of evidence, the ratio of benefits to harms, and/or variation in patient preferences,” yet they remain important because “they explicitly acknowledge uncertainty while still providing evidence-based guidance to clinical practice,” and help identify gaps and justify some practice variation.

### Clinical practice guideline: otitis media with effusion (update) [^6688fa4d]. Otolaryngology--Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Medium credibility.

Otitis media with effusion guideline—strength of action terms and implied obligation defines three categories. Strong recommendation: the quality of the supporting evidence is high (grade A or B), and Clinicians should follow a strong recommendation unless a clear and compelling rationale for an alternative approach is present. Recommendation: the quality of evidence is not as high (grade B or C), and Clinicians should also generally follow a recommendation but remain alert to new information and sensitive to patient preferences and modifying factors. Option: either the quality of evidence is suspect (grade D) or well-done studies (grade A, B, or C) show little clear advantage, and Clinicians should be flexible in their decision making regarding appropriate practice, although they may set bounds on alternatives; patient preference should have a substantial influencing role.
