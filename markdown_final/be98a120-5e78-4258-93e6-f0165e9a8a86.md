---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about determining the most likely diagnosis for a 20-year-old with epilepsy who, three days after a seizure, presents with high-grade fever, productive cough with pleuritic sputum, pleuritic chest pain, and worsening symptoms when lying on the left side. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the temporal relationship between the seizure and the respiratory symptoms. Then, I should verify which clinical features most strongly point toward pneumonia versus alternative pleuropulmonary diagnoses. Next, I will review the differential diagnosis and weigh competing entities like aspiration pneumonia, pneumothorax, pulmonary embolism, and pericarditis. After that, I need to check guideline-based diagnostic steps, including chest radiography and inflammatory markers. Finally, I will synthesize the most likely diagnosis and outline immediate management and risk stratification considerations, making sure I double-check each inference against the cited guidance and case-based evidence.

> Let me first confirm the temporal relationship and its implications. A generalized tonic–clonic seizure three days before the onset of fever, cough, and pleuritic chest pain fits the window for aspiration-related lung injury and secondary bacterial infection, and epilepsy is a recognized risk factor for aspiration pneumonia with substantial excess mortality from respiratory causes, which strengthens the causal plausibility here [^112o5ydU].

> Wait, let me verify the cardinal features against pneumonia criteria. High-grade fever, productive cough with purulent sputum, and pleuritic chest pain are classic for community-acquired pneumonia, and the CHEST/IDSA-aligned features list explicitly includes fever of 38°C or higher, pleural pain, dyspnea, tachypnea, and new focal chest findings as supportive of pneumonia in adults with acute cough, which matches this presentation closely [^111ukg7W] [^112gaLqu].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should consider competing diagnoses. Pneumothorax can cause pleuritic pain and positional symptoms, but the absence of sudden dyspnea and the presence of fever and purulent sputum make primary pneumothorax less likely, though I should keep a low threshold to reassess if hypoxia or asymmetric breath sounds emerge. Pulmonary embolism remains on the table for pleuritic pain, yet the triad of fever, productive cough, and pleuritic sputum is far more consistent with bacterial pneumonia than PE, and I should apply a validated decision rule if PE suspicion rises [^112kotWt]. Pericarditis can mimic pleuritic pain and may follow systemic inflammation, but the productive cough and purulent sputum steer me back toward a parenchymal process rather than isolated pericardial disease.

> I need to check the significance of positional worsening when lying on the left side. Initially, I thought this might reflect a left-sided empyema or effusion compressing the lung, but wait, I should verify the directionality. Pleural effusion pain is typically worse when lying on the affected side because gravity increases contact of the inflamed pleural surfaces; however, the patient reports worsening when lying on the left, which would imply a right-sided process if effusion were the driver, so this single detail does not localize neatly to a left-sided effusion and may simply reflect generalized pleural inflammation aggravated by position or diaphragmatic excursion rather than lateral effusion physiology. I should confirm laterality with imaging rather than over-interpret this symptom [^116yXofE].

> Next, I should review guideline-based diagnostics. For unexplained pleuritic chest pain with systemic features, obtain a chest radiograph to evaluate for pneumonia, effusion, or other abnormalities. Add inflammatory markers such as CRP to strengthen diagnostic certainty for pneumonia in the outpatient setting, where CRP greater than 30 mg/L in the presence of compatible symptoms increases the likelihood of pneumonia, while values below 10 mg/L make pneumonia unlikely in the absence of daily fever and dyspnea [^116yXofE] [^116hhrwJ]. I should also consider sputum studies if feasible and obtain blood cultures if the patient is febrile and systemically ill, aligning with IDSA principles for CAP evaluation and management.

> Let me synthesize the most likely diagnosis. Given the recent generalized tonic–clonic seizure, the three-day interval to fever and productive pleuritic cough, and the absence of features more suggestive of pneumothorax, PE, or isolated pericarditis, aspiration pneumonia is the leading diagnosis, with the seizure providing the inciting aspiration event and the clinical picture matching community-acquired bacterial pneumonia thereafter [^112o5ydU] [^111ukg7W]. I should confirm with chest radiography and consider CRP to support the diagnosis and guide severity assessment and disposition [^116yXofE].

> I should double-check immediate management implications. Start guideline-concordant empiric antibiotic therapy for community-acquired pneumonia while cultures are pending, assess oxygenation and respiratory status, and determine need for hospitalization using clinical judgment plus severity tools. In patients with recent seizures and aspiration risk, maintain aspiration precautions and ensure airway protection if mental status is altered [^1155ipN1]. If imaging reveals consolidation, effusion, or atypical findings, I will adjust therapy accordingly and escalate evaluation for complications such as empyema or abscess if clinically indicated.

> But wait, what if the seizure itself reflects a systemic infection rather than a primary neurologic event? COVID-19 and other systemic infections can lower seizure threshold and present with seizures, and some patients with COVID-19 have minimal respiratory symptoms early, so I should consider SARS-CoV-2 testing in the right epidemiologic context while still prioritizing bacterial pneumonia management if the lung exam and imaging support it [^116fKGYV] [^111BBEAw]. If the clinical course deviates from typical bacterial pneumonia or if imaging is atypical, I will broaden the differential to include viral pneumonias, fungal disease in the right host, and tuberculosis depending on risk and endemicity, adjusting diagnostics accordingly [^117B5dj6].

---

The most likely diagnosis is **aspiration pneumonia** [^112o5ydU] due to recent seizure with impaired airway protection, leading to inhalation of oropharyngeal secretions and secondary bacterial infection. The triad of **high-grade fever, productive cough with pleuritic chest pain, and positional worsening** is classic for pneumonia with pleural involvement [^111ukg7W], and the left-lateral decubitus exacerbation suggests a left lower lobe process [^notfound]. Immediate evaluation should include **chest radiography, CBC, CRP, and sputum culture** [^111ukg7W]; if unstable or if empyema is suspected, obtain a **CT scan** [^notfound]. Start empiric antibiotics covering anaerobes and common pathogens, and monitor for complications such as empyema or ARDS [^notfound].

## Differential diagnosis

| **Condition** | **Rationale** | **Likelihood** |
|-|-|-|
| Aspiration pneumonia | Recent seizure with impaired airway protection, productive cough, pleuritic chest pain, positional worsening | High |
| Community-acquired pneumonia | Fever, productive cough, pleuritic chest pain | Moderate |
| Pleural effusion/empyema | Pleuritic chest pain, positional worsening, fever | Moderate |
| Pulmonary embolism | Pleuritic chest pain, recent seizure (immobilization) | Low |
| Pneumothorax | Pleuritic chest pain, positional worsening | Low |
| Pericarditis | Pleuritic chest pain, positional worsening | Low |

---

Aspiration pneumonia is most likely given the **recent seizure** and classic pneumonia features [^notfound].

---

## Pathophysiology of aspiration pneumonia

Aspiration pneumonia arises when oropharyngeal secretions or gastric contents are inhaled into the lower respiratory tract, causing **chemical injury and secondary bacterial infection**. Seizures impair consciousness and airway reflexes, increasing aspiration risk [^notfound]. Common pathogens include anaerobes (e.g. Bacteroides, Fusobacterium), Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and gram-negative bacilli [^notfound].

---

## Clinical features supporting aspiration pneumonia

- **High-grade fever**: Common in bacterial pneumonia [^111upusP].
- **Productive cough with pleuritic chest pain**: Typical of pneumonia with pleural involvement [^111upusP].
- **Positional worsening**: Suggests pleural effusion or empyema, common complications of aspiration pneumonia [^notfound].
- **Recent seizure**: Strong risk factor for aspiration [^notfound].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

- **Chest radiography**: Initial imaging to confirm pneumonia, detect effusion, or localize disease [^116yXofE].
- **Complete blood count (CBC) and C-reactive protein (CRP)**: Assess inflammatory response and guide severity [^notfound].
- **Sputum culture**: Identify causative organisms and guide therapy [^notfound].
- **Chest CT scan**: If empyema or complicated pneumonia is suspected [^notfound].

---

## Management

Empiric **antibiotic therapy** should cover anaerobes and common pathogens (e.g. amoxicillin-clavulanate, ampicillin-sulbactam, or a combination of a beta-lactam with metronidazole) [^notfound]. Supportive care includes oxygen, hydration, and close monitoring for complications such as empyema or ARDS [^notfound]. If empyema is present, obtain surgical consultation for possible drainage [^notfound].

---

## Potential complications

Complications include **pleural effusion or empyema**, which may require drainage [^112ZkEmi]; acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), a severe complication requiring intensive care; and sepsis, a systemic infection necessitating aggressive management [^notfound].

---

The most likely diagnosis is **aspiration pneumonia** due to recent seizure, with clinical features and imaging guiding management and complication surveillance [^112o5ydU].

### COVID-19 in patients with seizures and epilepsy: interpretation of relevant knowledge of presenting signs and symptoms [^111BBEAw]. Epilepsy Currents (2020). Medium credibility.

There are now numerous case reports describing seizures and other paroxysmal events in association with COVID-19. Individual reports include a new-onset generalized tonic clonic seizure during likely COVID-19 presentation, focal status epilepticus, seizures in critically ill patients, and COVID-19 presenting with paroxysmal events (possibly seizures) in a 6-week-old male.

As compared to population-based studies of the initial clinical presentation of COVID-19, studies in patients with seizures and epilepsy are lacking. However, available studies are consistent with the general concept that seizures and epilepsy are infrequently worsened by COVID-19. Case studies, despite their inherent drawbacks in accounting for the multifactorial causes of seizures and epilepsy, highlight that some patients will present with seizures early in the course of COVID-19 infection.

Case Presentation

A 53-year-old woman with no significant past medical history came to her local ED after a witnessed generalized tonic-clonic seizure. CT scan imaging of the head revealed a left frontal lobe hypodensity concerning for a mass with surrounding edema. In the previous month, she had undergone ambulatory evaluation for a subacute cough that had more recently become productive of bloody sputum. Outpatient chest radiography had demonstrated a new right lung opacity, shown on subsequent CT scan imaging to be a right upper lobe (RUL) consolidation. She was prescribed a course of doxycycline, after which sputum expectoration improved but a nonproductive cough remained. Repeat thoracic imaging was pending at the time the seizure occurred. The patient had no history of chronic lung disease or recurrent infections. There were no constitutional symptoms. She did not take any home medications on a regular basis. She was a lifetime nontobacco user. She denied use of alcohol and illicit drugs. She had previously worked in a medical office but was now spending most of her time helping her husband take care of their house and property in Kingston, New York, a town of about 23,000 people in the Hudson River Valley. She was born in the United States and had not traveled recently. She had no pets. There was no history of recent dental procedures. She was transferred to our institution for neurosurgical evaluation.

### Acute fibrinous organising pneumonia presenting as a cavitary lung lesion and treatment response to azithromycin [^114BCgow]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Acute fibrinous organising pneumonia is distinct from the classic diffuse alveolar damage, organising pneumonia and eosinophilic pneumonia. A 52-year-old woman presented with fever, productive cough, night sweats and left-sided pleuritic chest pain for a week. Physical examination was significant only for decreased breath sounds in the left infraclavicular area laterally. Imaging studies revealed a peripheral thick-walled left upper lobe cavitary lesion, left lower lobe consolidation and an enlarged subcarinal lymph node. She was treated with doxycycline for 10 days without improvement. Pertinent laboratory tests, microbiologic workup and fibre-optic bronchoscopy were non-diagnostic and a CT-guided left upper lobe lung biopsy revealed acute fibrinous organising pneumonia. She was treated with azithromycin with complete resolution of symptoms. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of acute fibrinous organising pneumonia presenting as a cavitary lung lesion and the first with treatment response to azithromycin.

### Pleurisy… [^1129JNXL]. Wikipedia (2003). Low credibility.

Pleurisy, also known as pleuritis, is inflammation of the membranes that surround the lungs and line the chest cavity. This can result in a sharp chest pain while breathing. Occasionally the pain may be a constant dull ache. Other symptoms may include shortness of breath, cough, fever, or weight loss, depending on the underlying cause. Pleurisy can be caused by a variety of conditions, including viral or bacterial infections, autoimmune disorders, and pulmonary embolism. The most common cause is a viral infection. Other causes include bacterial infection, pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, autoimmune disorders, lung cancer, following heart surgery, pancreatitis and asbestosis. Occasionally the cause remains unknown. The underlying mechanism involves the rubbing together of the pleurae instead of smooth gliding. Other conditions that can produce similar symptoms include pericarditis, heart attack, cholecystitis, pulmonary embolism, and pneumothorax.

Diagnostic testing may include a chest X-ray, electrocardiogram, and blood tests. Signs and symptoms The defining symptom of pleurisy is a sudden sharp, stabbing, burning or dull pain in the right or left side of the chest during breathing, especially when one inhales and exhales. It feels worse with deep breathing, coughing, sneezing, or laughing. The pain may stay in one place, or it may spread to the shoulder or back. Sometimes, it becomes a fairly constant dull ache. Depending on its cause, pleuritic chest pain may be accompanied by other symptoms:

- Dry cough
- Fever and chills
- Rapid, shallow breathing
- Shortness of breath
- Fast heart rate
- Sore throat followed by pain and swelling in the joints. Related problems Pleurisy is often associated with complications that affect the pleural space. Pleural effusion In some cases of pleurisy, excess fluid builds up in the pleural space. This is called a pleural effusion.

The buildup of excess fluid, will more often than not force the two layers of the pleura apart so they do not rub against each other when breathing. This can relieve the pain of pleurisy. A large amount of fluid can result in collapse of the lung. This can make it difficult to breathe. The most common symptom is sudden pain in one side of the lung and shortness of breath. A pneumothorax also can put pressure on the lung and cause it to collapse. If the pneumothorax is small, it may go away on its own. If large, a chest tube is placed through the skin and chest wall into the pleural space to remove the air. Causes The pleural space can be invaded by fluid, air, and particles from other parts of the body, which fairly complicates diagnosis. Viral infection is the most common cause of pleurisy. However, many other different conditions can cause pleuritic chest pain:

- Aortic dissections
- Autoimmune disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus, Autoimmune hepatitis, rheumatoid arthritis and Behçet's disease.
- Bacterial infections associated with pneumonia and tuberculosis
- Chest injuries.
- Familial Mediterranean fever, an inherited condition that often causes fever and swelling in the abdomen or the lungs
- Fungal or parasitic infections
- Heart surgery, especially coronary-artery bypass grafting
- Cardiac problems
- Inflammatory bowel disease
- Lung cancer and lymphoma.

Case Presentation

A 37-year-old man with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes presented with severe right-sided pleuritic chest pain, respiratory splinting, and cough. Two weeks earlier, he had been evaluated at an urgent care for cough and was prescribed a 5-day course of azithromycin for bronchitis. He then presented to our ED reporting mild, right-sided pleuritic chest pain. Vital signs were normal, and his chest radiograph showed a trace right pleural effusion (Fig 1A). He was discharged with naproxen for pleurisy. Three days later, he returned, reporting a dramatic increase in the severity of his pleuritic chest pain and a cough that had become productive of yellow-brown sputum. He denied fever, but endorsed chills and night sweats. His medications included atorvastatin, lisinopril, metformin, and saxagliptin. His parents were from Guam, although he was born and raised in San Diego, CA. He was employed as a social worker and denied any history of cigarette smoking, alcohol, or drug use.

Case presentation

A 63-year-old male patient was admitted to the Respiratory Medicine Department of Meizhou People's Hospital due to "persistent cough with occasional small amounts of white sputum, right-sided chest paroxysmal dull pain, and progressive exertional dyspnea that improved after rest over a period of more than two weeks". On November 1, 2022, after a right-sided thoracic puncture and drainage at a local hospital, his symptoms improved significantly. He did not experience palpitations, chest tightness, chills, or fever, and was subsequently discharged. However, on November 8, 2022, the patient was readmitted due to recurrent cough accompanied by right-sided chest pain, which intensified during coughing. There were no signs of fever, night sweats, or hemoptysis. Physical examination revealed the following vital signs: temperature of 36.5 °C, pulse rate of 96 beats/min, respiratory rate of 42 breaths/min, and blood pressure of 149/106 mmHg. The patient exhibited mild shortness of breath with a blood oxygen saturation of 96% while breathing ambient air. Chest examination showed the trachea was midline, the thoracic configuration and respiratory movements were normal, but the respiratory rate was slightly increased. Auscultation of both lungs revealed coarse breath sounds without dry or wet rales, and no significant pleural friction rub was detected. On the right side, tactile fremitus was decreased, pleural friction rub was not palpable, percussion over the right lower lung field yielded dullness, and breath sounds were diminished. Cardiovascular examination demonstrated a regular rhythm with no pathological murmurs heard in any valve areas. Abdominal examination revealed softness and flatness without tenderness or rebound tenderness. No abnormalities were found in the abdominal skin, and the abdominal mobility was negative for voiced sounds. The bowel sounds are normal. A CT scan indicated right-sided pleural effusion. Laboratory tests (Table 1) showed elevated levels of fibrinogen (5.74 g/L), D-dimer (2.98 mg/L), interleukin-6 (IL-6) (24.07 pg/mL), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (46 mm/h). Tuberculous pleurisy was suspected, and the patient was advised to be hospitalized for further treatment.

### COVID-19 in patients with seizures and epilepsy: interpretation of relevant knowledge of presenting signs and symptoms [^115g5qKL]. Epilepsy Currents (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The COVID-19 outbreak continues to evolve, currently with spread throughout the United States, which remains the epicenter of the pandemic. In all areas of medicine, there is a critical need for accurate information to inform an appropriate response to the outbreak. There are an increasing number of clinical studies for COVID-19, but our current understanding in relationship to seizures and epilepsy remains limited by relative lack of cohort studies, especially in patients with preexisting seizures and epilepsy. Realizing both the need for and limitation of current information, this summary provides a focused summary of pertinent clinical diagnostic information about neurological involvement of SARS-CoV-2 virus and COVID-19, especially in relationship to patients with seizures and epilepsy.

### Atypical presentation of COVID-19 in a frail older person [^116GtAWS]. Age and Ageing (2020). Medium credibility.

Common symptoms of pandemic coronavirus disease (COVID-19) include fever and cough. We describe a 94-year-old man with well-controlled schizoaffective disorder, who presented with non-specific and atypical symptoms: delirium, low-grade pyrexia and abdominal pain. He was given antibiotics for infection of unknown source, subsequently refined to treatment for community-acquired pneumonia. Despite active treatment, he deteriorated with oxygen desaturation and tachypnoea. A repeat chest X-ray showed widespread opacification. A postmortem throat swab identified COVID-19 infection. He was treated in three wards over 5 days with no infection control precautions. This has implications for the screening, assessment and isolation of frail older people to COVID-specific clinical facilities and highlights the potential for spread among healthcare professionals and other patients.

### A 31-year-old man with seizures, brain lesion, and lung nodules [^1134ajWS]. Chest (2021). Medium credibility.

Case Presentation

A 31-year-old man was admitted to our hospital with a recent history of generalized seizures. Three months earlier, he started with intermittent hemoptysis. CT scan showed a cavitary lung lesion in the upper segment of the right inferior lobe (RIL). Because of his job as a social worker in a high-risk population, he started treatment for Mycobacterium TB; however, the BAL culture result was negative. At the time of his current admission, he has continued taking rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and levofloxacin. He denied the use of any illicit drugs or alcohol. He had no history of smoking. One year earlier, he visited Southeast Asia, Oceania, and South Africa for several months. He reported a weight loss of 7 kg since then. Except for a recurrent oral candidiasis, he did not have a relevant medical history. His family history was notable for mother with lupus, and brother with sarcoidosis.

### Unusual presentation of miliary tuberculosis in a 12-year-old girl: a case report [^117WTs4r]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

The COVID-19 pandemic has emerged new conditions, including neuro-COVID which has presented by lung involvement and seizure. During the COVID-19 pandemic, miliary TB should be considered in TB endemic areas due to neuro-COVID diagnosis.

Our study showed that teenage patients might present extensive lung involvement in favor of miliary TB even in the absence of respiratory symptoms. Also, we found that severe miliary TB may occur even in a person who received the bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine. In an Iranian study, in 15 children aged under 72 months, disseminated BCG infection occurred after BCG vaccination. Also, in patients with CNS symptoms including seizure especially in TB endemic areas, miliary TB should be considered as a differential diagnosis, to prevent delay in diagnosis and treatment. We live in the TB endemic area. So, when a patient is admitted with a decreased level of consciousness and there is no reasonable cause, we should consider TB as a differential diagnosis. In the current case report, due to early diagnosis and treatment, neurological sequelae were not observed.

### A 44-year-old man with right limb convulsion and cavitary lung lesion with diffuse interstitial abnormalities [^113eQX45]. Chest (2022). Medium credibility.

Case Presentation

A 44-year-old man with a history of asthma presented with intermittent convulsion of the right limb, fever in the late afternoon, and decreased exercise tolerance over 2 months. Occasional productive cough, no hemoptysis, and weight loss of nearly 6 kg were observed during this period. Neither chemotherapy nor oral immunosuppressive drugs had been administered, and no exposure to toxic substances was known. He was a cook and had smoked approximately one pack of cigarettes per day for the past 20 years. The living environment was relatively humid. The patient presented to a local hospital, where the workup was notable for low-density shadows in the left parieto-occipital lobe and a cavity in the right upper lobe of the lung with bilateral diffuse interlobular septal thickening and multiple patchy ground-glass opacities. The brain and lung lesions were 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose avid on PET/CT scan. Bronchoscopy with BAL and transbronchial biopsy were nondiagnostic. While preparing for another diagnostic procedure, the patient gradually developed increasing dyspnea and more frequent convulsions with the progression of lesions on the follow-up chest CT scan. The patient was transferred to our hospital.

### Raising awareness of bronchiectasis in primary care: overview of diagnosis and management strategies in adults [^116PyQWB]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Clinical presentation — when to suspect bronchiectasis

A 66-year-old lady presents with a chest infection associated with cough productive of green sputum and increasing shortness of breath. She had never smoked and has no relevant past medical history. Chest x-ray shows no abnormality. She is treated with antibiotic therapy by her primary care physician and improves. She attends again a few months later with worsening productive cough. Her primary care physician notes that she has had several courses of antibiotics for chest infections over the previous 3 winters and has reported a chronic productive cough on a daily basis for the past 3 years.

In new patients or those that do not have an established diagnosis, one of the most common core symptoms is a persistent cough (> 90% of patients), often producing large quantities of mucoid (white or clear) or purulent (dark yellow, green or brown) sputum(Table 2). Adults may have a history of symptoms over many years. Recurrent respiratory tract infections also raise the possibility of bronchiectasis, and patients may take a long time to recover from chest infections or require multiple courses of antibiotics before symptoms fully resolve. Dyspnoea is present in a high proportion of cases, with frequent haemoptysis in severe disease. These symptoms can be variable across patients, with some having symptoms daily and others only having symptoms during exacerbations. The longstanding textbook teaching of bronchiectasis patients with widespread crackles, digital clubbing and cachexia is now rarely seen.

Case Presentation

A 22-year-old nonsmoker male, without any previous comorbidity, presented with 4 months' history of right upper back pain. Pain was constant dull aching type, nonpleuritic, aggravated by lying on the right lateral side and partially relieved on taking analgesics. He then developed progressive dyspnea over 2 months and noticed dilated veins over his neck and front of chest. There was associated unintentional weight loss of 6 kg. There was no history of cough, expectoration, wheeze, or hemoptysis, nor any episodes of night sweats or fever.

Case Presentation

A 29-year-old man with no significant medical history presented to the ED with a 4-week history of chest pain. The pain was insidious, located on the right side of the chest, increased by deep breathing, and incompletely alleviated by acetaminophen. The patient had never smoked tobacco. He denied any recent fevers, chills, dyspnea, cough, night sweats, hemoptysis, or history of trauma but had lost at least 8 kg in the past 6 months. The patient was from Morocco and had lived in France for 1 year.

### Hyperinfection syndrome with cerebral involvement [^115iXmDj]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

Case presentation

A South East Asian man in his 70s presented with cough and purulent sputum. His medical history included hypertension, myocardial infarction, nephrolithiasis and surgical stone extraction. He was a former smoker (30 pack-years) and reported no alcohol use. He was born and raised in South East Asia.

Six days after arrival, he complained of productive coughing, fever and was seen by a general practitioner and treated with phenoxymethylpenicillin for pneumonia (day 0). He was admitted to the emergency department on day 8 due to fever, malaise, nausea and headache. The physical examination revealed diffuse abdominal tenderness, normal chest auscultation and a few skin excoriations on his extremities. No other skin changes were noted. Again, he was treated for pneumonia based on the presence of bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray (figure 3). Blood eosinophils were 2.46×10⁹/L on admission. He was discharged on day 9 after overall improvement. On day 15, he was readmitted due to new-onset seizures. Neurological examination was normal, and no skin changes were noted. CT scan of the head showed a small hypodense area in the corona radiata, interpreted as sequelae of cerebral infarction. The seizures were thus thought to be postinfarction seizures, and antiplatelet therapy was initiated. On day 52, he was readmitted to the emergency department with severe abdominal pain and fever. The blood eosinophil counts were 0.05×10⁹/L (figure 4). A distended and tender abdomen was found on physical examination. A CT scan of the abdomen revealed severe coprostasis and an oedematous caecum. He received empirical antibiotic treatment with piperacillin/tazobactam. The next day, his condition worsened with the development of a severe headache and nuchal rigidity. Lumbar puncture was performed, showing pleocytosis with 1300×10⁶/L cells (920×10⁶ polymorphonuclear and 420×10⁶ mononuclear cells), a glucose level of 3.6 mmol/L and a protein level of 3.55 g/L in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).

### Adult outpatients with acute cough due to suspected pneumonia or influenza: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^116hhrwJ]. Chest (2019). High credibility.

Summary of recommendations — C-reactive protein (CRP) testing for suspected pneumonia in outpatient adults with acute cough: For outpatient adults with acute cough due to suspected pneumonia, we suggest measuring C-reactive protein (CRP) because the addition of CRP to features such as fever (38°C or greater), pleural pain, dyspnea and tachypnea, and signs on physical examination of the chest (tachypnea and new and localizing chest examination signs) strengthens both the diagnosis and exclusion of pneumonia (Grade 2C). Remarks specify that a CRP > 30 mg/L increases the likelihood that the cough may be related to having pneumonia, and that acute cough (ie, < 3 weeks in duration) is less likely to be caused by a pneumonia when the CRP < 10 mg/L or between 10–50 mg/L in the absence of dyspnea and daily fever.

### Neurodiagnostic evaluation of the child with a simple febrile seizure [^113edcJA]. Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

Background — simple febrile seizures definition and epidemiology indicate that a febrile seizure is accompanied by fever with temperature ≥ 100.4°F or 38°C by any method, occurs in infants and children 6 through 60 months of age without central nervous system infection, and febrile seizures occur in 2% to 5% of all children. Simple febrile seizures were defined as primary generalized seizures that lasted for less than 15 minutes and did not recur within 24 hours, whereas complex febrile seizures were defined as focal, prolonged (≥ 15 minutes), and/or recurrent within 24 hours. After a simple febrile seizure, the risk of epilepsy was only slightly higher than that of the general population, the chief risk was recurrence in one-third of the children, and authors concluded that simple febrile seizures are benign events with excellent prognoses.

Abstract

An 18-year-old woman with a history of focal epilepsy presents with increasingly frequent seizures, encephalopathy, multiple laboratory abnormalities, and hypothermia. During her hospital course, her symptoms waxed and waned. Multiple etiologies of her symptoms were considered, but the spontaneous resolution of her symptoms and an abnormal MRI of the brain revealed the final diagnosis.

### COVID-19 in patients with seizures and epilepsy: interpretation of relevant knowledge of presenting signs and symptoms [^114Jxv6z]. Epilepsy Currents (2020). Medium credibility.

There are an increasing number of clinical studies for COVID-19, with several large cohort studies documenting initial signs and symptoms. Realizing the need for current information, this summary provides a focused summary of pertinent clinical diagnostic information about neurological involvement of SARS-CoV-2 virus and clinical presentation of COVID-19, especially in relationship to patients with seizures and epilepsy. There is no evidence from cohort studies in the general population that seizures are worsened in COVID-19. However, relative lack of cohort studies in patients with a history of epileptic seizures limit conclusions about effects of COVID-19 patients with epilepsy. Overall, findings indicate seizures and epilepsy are rare, especially in mild COVID-19 cases, but may occur in more severe cases later in the disease course. Caregivers should be vigilant in assessing for possible seizures, especially in patients with systemic effects of severe COVID-19 infections.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^111upusP]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Bacterial pneumonia in individuals with HIV — clinical and radiographic presentation is similar to that in individuals without HIV, with patients caused by bacteria such as S. pneumoniae or Haemophilus characteristically having acute onset (3 to 5 days) of fevers, chills, rigors, chest pain or pleurisy, cough productive of purulent sputum, and dyspnea; tachypnea and decreased arterial oxygen saturation indicate moderate-to-severe pneumonia, and in such cases, clinicians should strongly consider hospitalizing the patient. Patients with bacterial pneumonia typically have signs of focal consolidation, such as egophony, and/or pleural effusion on examination, whereas in Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) lung examination often is normal and, if abnormal, reveals inspiratory crackles. In bacterial pneumonia the white blood cell (WBC) count usually is elevated, the elevation may be relative to baseline in those with advanced HIV, and neutrophilia or a left shift may be present. Chest radiographs characteristically show unilateral, focal, segmental, or lobar consolidation; those with S. pneumoniae or Haemophilus typically present with consolidation, whereas cavitation may be more suggestive of P. aeruginosa or S. aureus.

Case presentation

A 67-year-old man was hospitalized in our hospital complaining of a 10-day history of fever, with a temperature up to 38.8˚C. He denied cough, dyspnoea, chills, shivers or chest pain. Before hospitalization, azithromycin was given orally for 5 days and intravenously for 3 days, and levofloxacin was given intravenously for 1 day. However, the patient still had a fever. He had a past medical history of tuberculosis and gastritis. He was allergic to penicillin, cephalosporin and sulfonamide. He had smoked 10 cigarettes a day for more than 20 years. He retired from an office work and had no pneumotoxic exposure.

At admission, physical examination revealed bilateral reduced breath sounds. The patient was conscious but in a poor state of mind. He was emaciated, with a BMI of 16. The remainder of his physical examination was normal. The results of routine blood examination showed that the white blood cell (WBC) count (10,180/mm³ [normal range 3500–95,000/mm³]) and neutrophil (NEU) count (8600/mm³ [normal range 1800–6300/mm³]) were elevated. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (58 mm/h [normal range 0–15 mm/h]) and C-reactive protein (CRP) were increased (96.7 mg/L [normal range 5–10 mg/L]). Albumin was decreased (34.8 g/L [normal range 40–50 g/L]). The chest computed tomography (CT) scan showed scattered patchy high-density nodules with blurred edges in the bilateral lungs. Pleural effusion was present on the right side (Fig. 1 A, B).

### Chronic cough: evaluation and management | AAFP… [^117X1XZS]. AAFP (2017). Low credibility.

4 in recognition of the fact that multiple etiologies, including chronic rhinosinusitis, allergic rhinitis, and nonallergic rhinitis, were difficult to differentiate solely by clinical presentation. UACS is the most common cause of chronic cough. 10 Rhinorrhea, nasal stuffiness, sneezing, itching, and postnasal drainage suggest the diagnosis, but their absence does not rule out UACS. 11 Physical findings may include swollen turbinates and direct visualization of postnasal drainage and cobblestoning of the posterior pharynx. If a specific cause is identified, therapy should be started; otherwise, initial treatment includes a decongestant combined with a first-generation antihistamine. Intranasal corticosteroids, saline nasal rinses, nasal anticholinergics, and antihistamines are also reasonable options. 10 Clinical improvement should occur within days to weeks, and up to two months.

If chronic rhinosinusitis is suspected, sinus computed tomography or flexible nasolaryngoscopy should be performed. Sinus radiography is not recommended because of limited sensitivity.
12. ASTHMA AND COPD The prevalence of asthma in patients with chronic cough ranges from 24% to 29%. 13 It should be suspected in patients with shortness of breath, wheezing, and chest tightness, but cough can be the only manifestation in cough variant asthma. If the physical examination and spirometry findings are nondiagnostic, bronchial challenge testing should be considered. 14 Resolution of the cough after asthma treatment is also diagnostic. After counseling the patient about potential triggers, treatment usually includes an inhaled bronchodilator and high-dose inhaled corticosteroid. A leukotriene receptor antagonist can also be useful. Symptoms should resolve within one to two weeks after starting treatment.

15–17 For severe or refractory cough, a five- to 10-day course of prednisone, 40 to 60 mg, or equivalent oral corticosteroid can be considered if asthma is strongly suspected. 4, 13. COPD commonly causes chronic cough, but most patients presenting with chronic cough do not have undiagnosed COPD. Signs and symptoms suggestive of asthma also occur in persons with COPD. Spirometry is diagnostic, and purulent sputum production may also be present. Treatment includes an inhaled bronchodilator, inhaled anticholinergic, inhaled corticosteroid, and a one- to two-week course of oral corticosteroids.
18. NONASTHMATIC EOSINOPHILIC BRONCHITIS Nonasthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis is characterized by chronic cough in patients with no symptoms or objective evidence of variable airflow obstruction, normal airway responsiveness on a methacholine inhalation test, and sputum eosinophilia.

19 Sputum evaluation is not typically performed in the primary care setting, but it can be induced by saline nebulization or obtained by bron-choalveolar lavage in a subspecialist's office. The prevalence is unclear, but studies assessing airway inflammation in patients with chronic cough showed that this condition accounts for 10% to 30% of cases referred for subspecialist investigation. 14, 20 It does not respond to inhaled bronchodilators, but should respond to inhaled corticosteroids. Avoidance strategies should be recommended when the inflammation is due to occupational exposure or inhaled allergens. Oral corticosteroids are rarely needed but can be considered if high-dose inhaled corticosteroids are ineffective.
14. GASTROESOPHAGEAL/LARYNGOPHARYNGEAL REFLUX DISEASE The prevalence of GERD and laryngopharyngeal reflux disease as causative factors in chronic cough varies from 0% to 73%.

Fig. 2
Initial contrast enhanced axial chest-CT images in mediastinal window showed a huge heterogeneously enhancing left lung mass (long arrows) with extension into the left main stem bronchus (short arrow), vascular encasement and mediastinal shift to the right

A Left lung malignant tumor with possible metastasis to the contralateral lung and mediastinal lymph nodes was strongly suspected. We also entertained possible brain metastasis as a cause of the previously diagnosed seizure disorder. Percutaneous lung biopsy was done but histology was inconclusive due to inadequate tissue specimen. The pathologist's report, however, made note of possible presence of fungal elements which could not be distinguished from artefacts in the absence of special stains. Treating clinicians interpreted this as a possible superimposed fungal infection and initiated a short course of oral fluconazole 200 mg daily. Repeat biopsy was arranged on out-patient basis due to insistence by her parents for discharge.

Patient unfortunately defaulted on the biopsy appointment and returned to clinic about five months later with symptoms of dysphagia to solids, focal seizures of the left upper limb (defaulted on carbamazepine) and huge lumps on her left chest wall. She was fully conscious with no lateralizing signs but looked cachexic (Her weight had dropped from 52 kg at initial visit to 36 kg), pale, afebrile and moderately dyspnoeic at rest. The chest lumps/masses were firm-to-hard, non-tender and located on the left anterior, lateral, and posterior chest wall with the largest measuring 15 × 25 cm (Figs. 3 a and b and 4 a) with no differential warmth. An ulcer discharging a gelatinous fluid at the old chest tube insertion site was noted (Fig. 4 a) and the spleen was palpable 5 cm below the costal margin.

A 49-year-old woman with a medical history of epilepsy presented to the ED 1 h after a single, 15-min, witnessed, tonic-clonic seizure. Over the preceding 6 months, she had experienced five similar seizures of shorter duration. There were no recent changes to her phenytoin dose nor had she started any new medications. The patient had traveled to Jamaica 3 weeks before presentation, where she smoked marijuana once but otherwise had not used illicit substances nor had she used tobacco or alcohol. She states she felt well during and after the trip until this presentation. While being evaluated by the neurology service, the patient complained of sudden-onset chest pain and cough with associated hypoxemia. She denied changes in her sleep habits, she had not experienced any fevers, and she had no changes in her exercise tolerance. The patient was admitted to the general medicine floor for further workup.

### Chlamydia pneumoniae-associated pleuropericarditis: a case report and systematic review of the literature [^114ZuSGQ]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A 40-year old female was transferred to our Department of Medicine for the assessment and treatment of pleuropericarditis following lower respiratory tract infection. Her body mass index was 25.7 kg/m 2 and her personal history was positive for current smoking (~ 10 cigarettes/day, 40 pack years) and arterial hypertension (occasional use of amlodipine 5 mg). The present history of the patient begins 5 weeks ago with a hospitalization in a Respiratory Department for CAP (fever, dyspnea, chest X-ray positive for consolidation on the left upper lobe; Additional File 1). The patient received ceftriaxone and moxifloxacin for 10 days without any medical report on causative pathogen. Four weeks after her discharge the patient presented with fever, shortness of breath especially in exertion and pleuritic chest pain and was admitted to a Respiratory Department where bilateral pleural (mainly left) and mild pericardial effusion were found. Pericardial friction rub was not identified. Her blood tests revealed increased neutrophils and indices of inflammation (Table 1, Additional File 1). Piperacillin/tazobactam and linezolid were initially administered. Thoracocentesis on the left side revealed neutrophilic exudate with pH 7.40. Despite antibiotic treatment, patient was not improved. Moreover C-reactive protein (CRP), pleural and pericardial effusions remained unchanged. Procalcitonin, high-sensitive troponin and brain natriuretic peptide levels were within normal limits during hospitalization. Blood and sputum cultures were negative. Extensive rheumatological workup was negative. In electrocardiography sinus tachycardia (112 bpm), frequent premature ventricular contractions, periods of ventricular trigeminy and inverted T-wave in V1–V6 were observed. Echocardiography was positive for mild mitral and triscupid valve regurgitation and mild pericardial effusion, without any sign of hemodynamic decompensation. Computed tomography (CT) imaging (including CT pulmonary angiogram) did not reveal pulmonary embolism or pathological findings from lung parenchyma and was positive only for the presence of pleural and pericardial effusions (Additional File 1). Pulmonologists administered ibuprofen 600 mg three times daily with the indication of idiopathic pleuropericarditis. The patient presented allergic reaction to ibuprofen and was transferred to our Department of Medicine on day (D) 12. Upon her admission, the patient presented with diffuse maculo-papular rash that was attributed to the allergic reaction to ibuprofen. Ibuprofen was withdrawn and IV methylprednisolone 40 mg once daily was initiated. Antibiotic treatment was suspended due to the lack of evidence of bacterial infection. Due to sinus tachycardia and premature ventricular complexes metoprolol 25 mg twice daily was administered. Patient's file was reviewed and pericarditis investigation and differential diagnosis was conducted according to current guidelines. The patient fulfilled two out of four major criteria (pericardial chest pain and new pericardial effusion), along with one of the additional supporting findings (elevated CRP, white blood cells and erythrocyte sedimentation rate), rendering the diagnosis of pericarditis evidence-based. Colchicine 0.5 mg once daily (patient's weight 66 kg) was initiated, for the treatment of pericarditis under investigation. The patient presented clinical improvement and CRP dropped to nearly normal (Additional File 1). Methylprednisolone was stopped after 3 days, as it was administered to treat the allergic reaction to ibuprophen. Low grade fever and pleuritic chest pain recurred rapidly, along with rising CRP levels. A new chest X-ray revealed bilateral pleural effusion but this time mainly on the right side. A repeat thoracocentesis revealed neutrophilic exudate with pH 7.40 and in a new chest CT the only new finding was the reduction of the left pleural effusion in combination with the increase of the right sided pleural effusion. Empirical initiation of meropenem was decided (Additional File 1). Clinical and laboratory findings did not improve with the addition of antibiotics; thus, antibiotics were suspended due to lack of evidence in favor of a bacterial cause for the new fever and IV methylprednisolone 40 mg once daily was again initiated.

Case Presentation

A 26-year-old man presented to the ED with dizziness and gait imbalance. He noted dizziness for 3 months, but symptoms progressed more rapidly over the last 3 weeks when he began experiencing nausea, vomiting, and "wobbly legs". These symptoms would worsen with physical exertion, especially when lifting heavy objects. On review of systems, he also reported subjective fevers and chills. He had no appreciable dyspnea, cough, chest pain, or increased sputum production. The patient recalled a history of "brain surgery" approximately 4 years prior to his presentation, but no further details could be provided at the time.

### Patient with slow-growing mediastinal mass presents with chest pain and dyspnea [^115oknuA]. Chest (2016). Low credibility.

A 52-year-old white woman presented with severe pain over the right upper abdomen and nonpleuritic, right-sided, lower chest-wall pain. Her pain had progressively gotten more frequent and severe over the last 5 months. It was also associated with a nonexertional, pressure-like sensation in the central chest. The patient denied any shortness of breath, fevers, cough, or any sputum production. She was taking levothyroxine for hypothyroidism and was a 30-pack-year current smoker; there was no history of drug abuse or occupational exposure. Previous chest radiographs dating back to 5 years consistently showed an elevated right-sided hemidiaphragm without any infiltrates or effusions; cardiomediastinal structures were unremarkable. She had not had a previous workup for these abnormal findings.

### Fatal tuberculous meningitis in an infant presenting with seizures in the UK [^116JokKQ]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

A 5-month-old male child of European background presented with sudden onset of prolonged afebrile seizures. He was intubated and transferred to the paediatric intensive care unit where he displayed abnormal neurology and remained ventilated. Brain MRI showed basal leptomeningeal enhancement suggesting malignancy or infection. Subsequent cerebrospinal fluid results of lymphocytic pleocytosis and raised protein were suggestive of tuberculous (TB) meningitis and anti-TB treatment was commenced empirically. Positive TB microbiology was eventually confirmed on respiratory secretions. The infant continued to show abnormal neurologic findings and repeated neuroimaging showed a new extensive cerebral infarct. The infant was compassionately extubated and passed away. The father was later found to have pulmonary TB. This case is an important reminder of TB meningitis for countries where TB is uncommon. The importance of considering TB in any child with abnormal neurology and of taking prompt family histories to identify children at risk is highlighted.

### Hippocratic concepts of acute and urgent respiratory diseases still relevant to contemporary medical thinking and practice: a scoping review [^115PoDX1]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Thoracic empyema

Acute respiratory diseases, if not treated in time, could result in the formation of thoracic empyema, the net result of the collection of bile and phlegm in the lung and failed expectoration. In terms of diagnosis, the emphasis was on dyspnoea, fever, pain, non-productive cough and plectrodactyly, the famous Hippocratic drumstick fingers, a term still valid. The collection of pus in the thoracic cavity was revealed by the presentation of fever and rigour or when "a heaviness took the place of the pain" in the chest. The presence of diarrhoea caused further clinical deterioration and death.

The thorough examination of the suspected side provided evidence of empyema: "Turn the patient. inquire whether he has a pain in the side. And if one side be somewhat hotter than the other, ask the patient, while he is lying on the sound side, if he feels a weight hanging from the upper part. Should this be so, the empyema is one-sided, on whichever side the weight occurs". The diagnosis was further facilitated by direct chest auscultation after shaking the patient: "If the patient does not expectorate. set him on a steady chair; let someone else hold him by the shoulders, and you shake him, applying your ear to his sides". The physician searched for " a sound in the flank as if in a wineskin" from the pus splashing. What is even more impressive, is the high degree of clinical suspicion recommended if there were no such auscultatory findings: "If the pus, because of its thickness, does not fluctuate or make any sound in the chest, but the patient draws his breath rapidly, his feet swell up, and a mild cough is present, do not be deceived, but know well that his chest is full of pus".

Epilepsy and seizures

With increasing case reports regarding COVID-19 patients presenting with seizures, current literature suggests that COVID-19 can reduce seizure threshold in patients with an existing seizure disorder. What is more, COVID-19 does not only worsen seizure control in patients with previously well-controlled seizures, but it can trigger new-onset seizures in patients with no known history of seizures. Direct effects of COVID-19 on patients with epilepsy and the exact prevalence of new-onset epilepsy cases is still unclear (estimated pooled prevalence 0.9%). Hypoxia, fever, multi-organ failure, and severe metabolic or electrolyte disarrangements due to COVID-19 can possibly trigger seizures. Seizure can also occur secondary to a meningitis/encephalitis associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, seizures can be the initial presentation of COVID-19 and patients may have no respiratory symptoms at all. Apart from generalized tonic–clonic seizures, focal seizures have also been observed as a clinical feature of COVID-19. Pediatric seizure cases have been reported and therefore, seizure must be recognized as a potential COVID-19 presentation in the pediatric age groups, even in children without fever (afebrile seizures). In addition to antiepileptic drugs, patients who severely suffer from COVID-19 and further demonstrate clinical signs of seizures or encephalopathy could benefit from electroencephalography monitoring to early diagnose and treat seizures. Despite the lack of clear evidence suggesting an additional risk of symptomatic seizures in COVID-19 patients, uncommon and atypical clinal presentation of COVID-19 patients in association with seizure must be considered to prevent complications and long-term sequelae.

### Epilepsy… [^1166tk7U]. Wikipedia (2002). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of epilepsy typically requires at least two unprovoked seizures occurring more than 24 hours apart. In some cases, however, it may be diagnosed after a single unprovoked seizure if clinical evidence suggests a high risk of recurrence. Isolated seizures that occur without recurrence risk or are provoked by identifiable causes are not considered indicative of epilepsy. The underlying cause is often unknown, but epilepsy can result from brain injury, stroke, infections, tumors, genetic conditions, or developmental abnormalities. Epilepsy that occurs as a result of other issues may be preventable. Diagnosis involves ruling out other conditions that can resemble seizures, and may include neuroimaging, blood tests, and electroencephalography. They are further classified based on the state of consciousness during the episode:

- **Focal preserved consciousness seizure**: the person remains aware and responsive.
- **Focal impaired consciousness seizure**: awareness and/or responsiveness are affected. In clinical practice, a structural cause is typically identified through neuroimaging, which reveals an abnormality that plausibly accounts for the individual's seizure semiology and EEG findings. The lesion must be epileptogenic, meaning that it is capable of generating seizures. Infections like encephalitis or brain abscess may lead to permanent structural damage, increasing the risk of epilepsy even after the infection resolves. Some genetic disorders, including phakomatoses such as tuberous sclerosis complex and Sturge–Weber syndrome, are strongly associated with epilepsy. Infectious Infectious causes include infections of the central nervous system that directly affect brain tissue and lead to long-term seizure susceptibility.

Examples include herpes simplex encephalitis, which carries a high risk of developing epilepsy, and neurocysticercosis, a major preventable cause of epilepsy in endemic regions. Other infections such as cerebral malaria, toxoplasmosis, and toxocariasis. Immune Immune causes include conditions like autoimmune encephalitis, in which the immune system attacks brain tissue, often presenting with seizures. Certain autoimmune epilepsies are associated with specific autoantibodies, including those against the NMDA receptor, LGI1, and CASPR2. These cases often present with rapid-onset, difficult-to-treat seizures. Celiac disease has also been associated with epilepsy in rare syndromic forms, such as the triad of epilepsy, cerebral calcifications, and celiac disease. Diagnosis The diagnosis of epilepsy is primarily clinical, based on a thorough evaluation of the person's history, seizure features, and risk of recurrence.

Diagnostic tests such as electroencephalograms and neuroimaging can support the diagnosis. Clinicians must also distinguish epileptic seizures from other conditions that can mimic them and determine whether the event was provoked by an acute, reversible cause or if it suggests a long-term tendency for unprovoked seizures. Definition According to the International League Against Epilepsy, a diagnosis of epilepsy can be made when any one of the following criteria is met: At least two unprovoked seizures occurring more than 24 hours apart One unprovoked seizure and a probability of further seizures similar to the general recurrence risk after two unprovoked seizures, occurring over the next 10 years Diagnosis of an epilepsy syndrome. Classification Once epilepsy is diagnosed, the ILAE recommends a three-level framework to guide further classification and management:

- Identify the seizure type, based on clinical features and EEG (e.g.

### A rare case of disseminated pulmonary cryptococcosis in an immunocompetent patient [^115rkGUD]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A 19-year-old young female was referred to the TB clinic of a tertiary hospital with about 3 weeks history of shortness of breath and a total left "whiteout" on a chest radiograph suspected to be a massive left pleural effusion (Fig. 1). She had a 5-month history of cough, productive of scanty clear sputum with associated night sweats and minimal weight loss. A chest tube was passed at a district hospital with no significant pleural aspirate obtained. Thus, the tube was removed and patient was referred as a case of suspected pulmonary TB. On past medical history, the patient had been diagnosed with seizure disorder at the same district hospital about 7-months prior to the onset of the chronic cough for which oral Carbamazepine 200 mg daily was initiated. According to the mother, patient had a normal childhood with no significant medical events and their family history was unremarkable. She was a secondary school student and lived in a rural community with her parents who were peasant farmers growing corn and a variety of vegetables. The patient together with her siblings helped out on their parents' farm often.

Fig. 1
Frontal chest radiography showing complete opacification of the left lung with mediastinal shift to the right side

At presentation, we found a chronically-ill looking young female, mildly dyspneic at rest with no pallor, fever or peripheral lymphadenopathy. Chest auscultation was suggestive of left hemithorax consolidation whiles other systems examined revealed normal findings. Initial investigations done included repeat sputum geneXpert (Negative) and a fasting blood sugar of 5.1mmol. Other test results are shown in Table 1.1 and 1.2.

Chest Computed Tomography (CT-scan) showed replacement of the left lung by a large complex heterogeneously enhancing mass with hypoenhancing areas suggestive of cystic change or necrosis. The lesion caused complete compression of the left main bronchus and partially encased the pulmonary trunk and thoracic aorta (Fig. 2). Oesophageal compression by the mass was also evident. A second 4 mm solitary pulmonary nodule was noted in the apex of the right lung as well as multiple enlarged supraclavicular, paratracheal, sub-carinal, and left hilar lymph nodes.

### Diagnosis and treatment of community-acquired pneumonia [^1155ipN1]. American Family Physician (2006). Low credibility.

Patients with community-acquired pneumonia often present with cough, fever, chills, fatigue, dyspnea, rigors, and pleuritic chest pain. When a patient presents with suspected community-acquired pneumonia, the physician should first assess the need for hospitalization using a mortality prediction tool, such as the Pneumonia Severity Index, combined with clinical judgment. Consensus guidelines from several organizations recommend empiric therapy with macrolides, fluoroquinolones, or doxycycline. Patients who are hospitalized should be switched from parenteral antibiotics to oral antibiotics after their symptoms improve, they are afebrile, and they are able to tolerate oral medications. Clinical pathways are important tools to improve care and maximize cost-effectiveness in hospitalized patients.

### Methotrexate (Otrexup) [^111Ar9Zn]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Discontinuation of methotrexate does not always result in complete recovery. A transient acute neurologic syndrome has been observed in patients treated with high dose regimens. Manifestations of this stroke-like encephalopathy may include confusion, hemiparesis, transient blindness, seizures and coma. The exact cause is unknown. After the intrathecal use of methotrexate, the central nervous system toxicity which may occur can be classified as follows: acute chemical arachnoiditis manifested by such symptoms as headache, back pain, nuchal rigidity, and fever; sub-acute myelopathy characterized by paraparesis/paraplegia associated with involvement with one or more spinal nerve roots; chronic leukoencephalopathy manifested by confusion, irritability, somnolence, ataxia, dementia, seizures and coma. This condition can be progressive and even fatal.

Pulmonary:

Methotrexate-induced lung disease, including acute or chronic interstitial pneumonitis, is a potentially dangerous lesion, which may occur acutely at any time during therapy and has been reported at low doses. It is not always fully reversible and fatalities have been reported.

Pulmonary symptoms (especially a dry nonproductive cough) or a non-specific pneumonitis occurring during Otrexup therapy may be indicative of a potentially dangerous lesion and require interruption of treatment and careful investigation. Although clinically variable, the typical patient with methotrexate induced lung disease presents with fever, cough, dyspnea, hypoxemia, and an infiltrate on chest X-ray; infection (including pneumonia) needs to be excluded. This lesion can occur at all dosages.

Case Presentation

A 20-year-old previously healthy man presented to our hospital with a 2-week history of dull aching pain localized to the anterior chest wall, specifically in the sternum region. The pain was non-radiating and was exacerbated by physical activity or deep inspiration. There was no associated swelling, redness, or deformity of the chest wall. There were no associated systemic symptoms such as fever, weight loss, night sweats, and fatigue. Additionally, there was no history of recent respiratory infections, coughing, wheezing, dyspnea, hemoptysis, palpitations, edema, or orthopnea to suggest pulmonary or cardiac involvement. The patient was of Indian ethnicity and has been living in India since birth. However, he had no known exposure to individuals with active pulmonary TB. The patient reported no history of trauma, repetitive physical strain, or prior surgical interventions, such as sternotomy or chest wall procedures. His medical history was unremarkable, with no prior hospitalizations or chronic illnesses. There was no personal or family history of autoimmune disorders, such as ankylosing spondylitis, rheumatoid arthritis, or psoriatic arthritis, and he specifically denied symptoms such as morning stiffness, joint swelling, or peripheral joint pain that might suggest an inflammatory or autoimmune disorder. The absence of gastrointestinal or urogenital symptoms further reduced the likelihood of reactive arthritis or other systemic conditions. Relevant negatives also included no history of smoking, immunosuppressive therapy, or conditions such as diabetes or HIV that could increase susceptibility to infections.

### Profile of children admitted with seizures in a tertiary care hospital of Western Nepal [^113NrDdy]. BMC Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Methods

The following information was obtained from the medical records of each patient: age (range from 6 months to 15 years), sex, type of seizure, associated symptoms (fever, cough, rhinorrhea, vomiting, diarrhea and headache), family history of seizure or epilepsy, developmental history, laboratory test results (white blood count, C-reactive protein, serum electrolytes, blood sugar and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, neuroimaging; CT scan head or cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), electroencephalography (EEG) findings, duration of hospital stay, final diagnosis. Final outcome was recorded in four categories; discharged after recovery, left against medical advice (LAMA), mortality and referral to other institutions were also recorded.

Patients were divided into two groups based on whether the seizure was with or without fever: Group 1 comprised patients with temperature recorded greater than or equal to 38°C, and Group 2 comprised patients with temperature less than 38°C. Seizure type classification, including generalized tonic-clonic (GTC), absence, myoclonic, partial and other seizures types was based on the Commission on Epidemiology and Prognosis, 1993 International League Against Epilepsy. Status epileptics was defined as, "a single epileptic seizure of more than 30 minutes or a series of epileptic seizures during which function is not regained between ictal events in a period more than 30 minutes long". Febrile seizure was defined by the 1993 International League Against Epilepsy as, "an epileptic seizure occurring in childhood after 1 month of age, associated with febrile illness not caused by an infection of the central nervous system (CNS), without previous neonatal seizure or previous unprovoked seizure, and not meeting criteria for other acute symptomatic seizure". In addition, febrile seizures were classified as simple febrile seizures or complex febrile seizures. A simple febrile seizure lasts less than 15 minutes, is initially generalized in nature, and occurs once during a 24-hour period. In contrast, a complex febrile seizure lasts more than 15 minutes, has focal features at any time, or recurs within a 24-hour period.

### Cause-specific mortality in adult epilepsy patients from tyrol, Austria: hospital-based study [^112o5ydU]. Journal of Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

Malignant neoplasms [SMR 1.2 (95% CI 1.0–1.4)] were likewise within the range of previously reported findings from not elevated in patients with idiopathic/cryptogenic epilepsy in UK to SMR values of 1.4–5.6 in other cohorts.

In category (b); Causes of death not depicting an etiological cause for epilepsy, might still be associated with the disease, Pneumonia was frequently identified as a cause of premature death in epilepsy patients (SMR 3.5–10.1). The reason for this is not fully understood. It seems likely that generalized tonic–clonic seizures may lead to aspiration and later pneumonia with lethal consequences. This theory, however, has not been explored up to date. Nevertheless, other pathomechanisms have been discussed. Baumann et al. suggest that neurogenic pulmonary oedema secondary to generalized seizures could be mistaken for pneumonia. Pneumonia is also a common event in the elderly and frail population. Studies of institutionalized patients observed 25% of patients to die from respiratory death, while this cause was observed in only 5% of patients in the community. Higher SMR values therefore appear to be due to few cases in younger age groups where pneumonia as a cause of death is rare. This was supported by a British cohort, where pneumonia reached an SMR of 10.3, and the mean age of death was 81. The Swedish cohort reported an SMR of 4.2 (95% CI 3.6–4.8) and 40% of patients were older than 75 years at time of death.

Case Presentation

A 34-year-old man who did not use tobacco complained of hemoptysis with a small volume, severe dry cough, and low-grade fever for 5 months. He denied dyspnea, chest pain, night sweats, or weight loss. Chest CT scanning showed nodules with a cavity in the lower left lung. Pathogenic tests of BAL fluid were negative. Initially, he was diagnosed with pneumonia and received antibiotics. After a week, his symptoms resolved, and he was discharged from the hospital. Two months later, the patient presented again for the onset of dry cough and hemoptysis. Despite symptomatic treatment, his symptoms and chest CT scans had no improvement. Thereby, he was referred to our institution. He was prone to spontaneous bruising since childhood with a family history of spontaneous cerebral aneurysm. At 21 years of age, the patient underwent an appendectomy because of a suspected perforation. Also, he experienced cerebral hemorrhage 3 years earlier.

### Just a sore throat? Uncommon causes of significant respiratory disease [^116UMc1H]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

We present two uncommon underlying causes of a sore throat which, if missed or delayed in diagnosis, can lead to disastrous consequences. Our first case is of Lemierre's syndrome diagnosed in a 21-year-old man presenting with a 5-day history of sore throat, fever, right-sided pleuritic chest pain and bilateral pulmonary nodules on CT imaging. Fusobacterium necrophorum cultured from peripheral blood and an occluded left internal jugular vein on ultrasound lead to an eventual diagnosis. Our second case presents a 29-year-old woman with a 5-day history of sore throat, fever and right-sided pleuritic chest pain. A left-sided quinsy was diagnosed and aspirated and the patient was discharged home. She represented shortly with worsening pleuritic pain and was found to have a right-sided pleural effusion with descending mediastinitis originating from the tonsillar abscess. Delayed diagnosis resulted in open thoracotomy, decortication and prolonged intravenous antibiotics.

### Case report: inflammatory pseudotumor in the lung parenchyma caused by a medical suture originating from a cardiac surgery 35 years ago [^116sBvSi]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A 50-year-old woman presented with a lesion in the left lung for 20 months on routine examination. Computed tomography (CT) at a local hospital showed that there was an irregular mass in the upper lobe of her left lung, about 2.8 × 1.9 cm in size, with a clear boundary, peripheral spiculation, and stretched adjacent pleura. The patient had no symptoms such as cough, sputum, dyspnea, fever, and hemoptysis. One month ago, she underwent surgery for the left breast cancer in the local hospital. A second chest CT showed no significant changes in the mass. Positron emission tomography-CT (PET-CT) revealed an irregular high-density mass in the left lung with increased fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake, no significant abnormal FDG metabolism in the rest of the body, multiple small lymph nodes in the left axilla, and slightly increased FDG uptake in some lymph nodes.

For further treatment, the patient was admitted to our department. There was no obvious abnormality on physical examination. The chest CT showed an irregular soft tissue mass in the anterior segment of the upper lobe of the left lung, and the border was not clear. The cross-sectional area was about 3.2 × 2.2 cm, and the spiculation sign could be seen. The plain CT value was 30 HU. Calcification of the patch was obvious after enhanced scanning, and the CT value was 98 HU. The mediastinal structure was clear, and no obvious enlarged lymph nodes were seen (Fig. 1). There were no significant abnormalities in blood sample tests, including tumor markers. The patient had suffered from tetralogy of Fallot and underwent surgery for a ventricular septal repair35 years ago. Breast-conserving surgery was performed for her left breast cancer 1 month ago, and the pathological report confirmed a lobular carcinoma in situ. She had a family history of lung cancer (grandfather) and no smoking history.

### A 57-year-old man with a large left pleural effusion [^112JvkQV]. Chest (2022). Medium credibility.

Case Presentation

A previously healthy 57-year-old man presented to the ED with altered mental status and severe shortness of breath. He was found to be in acute hypercapnic respiratory failure and required admission to the ICU. He reported the following: a 4-month history of progressive shortness of breath; left-sided chest pain; cough productive of brown, foul-smelling sputum; and weight loss. He had an extensive smoking history but had quit 1 year prior. The patient was born in Ethiopia but had been living in the United States for the last 20 years. His last visit to Ethiopia was in 2009, and he denied any other recent travel or exposure to TB. There was no history to suggest immune compromise. He had not seen a physician in many years and never established medical care in the United States.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Histoplasmosis — clinical manifestations in people with HIV commonly presents with progressive disseminated disease characterized by fever, fatigue, weight loss, and hepatosplenomegaly, while cough, chest pain, and dyspnea occur in approximately 50% of patients. Central nervous system (CNS), gastrointestinal (GI), and cutaneous manifestations occur in a smaller percentage of patients, and approximately 10% of patients experience shock and multi-organ failure. CNS histoplasmosis typically causes fever and headache and, if brain involvement is present, seizures, focal neurological deficits, and changes in mental status, whereas GI disease usually manifests as diarrhea, fever, abdominal pain, and weight loss. In a case series of patients with AIDS in Panama, diarrhea was seen in 50% of the patients with histoplasmosis, and in patients with CD4 counts > 300 cells/mm³ the infection is often limited to the respiratory tract and usually presents with cough, pleuritic chest pain, and fever.

### Adult outpatients with acute cough due to suspected pneumonia or influenza: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^111ZUJ8V]. Chest (2019). High credibility.

Outpatient adults with acute cough due to suspected pneumonia — C-reactive protein (CRP): For outpatient adults with acute cough due to suspected pneumonia, we suggest measuring C-reactive protein (CRP) because the addition of CRP to features such as fever (38°C or greater), pleural pain, dyspnea and tachypnea, and signs on physical examination of the chest (tachypnea and new and localizing chest examination signs) strengthens both the diagnosis and exclusion of pneumonia (Grade 2C). The quality of evidence is low but a CRP > 30 mg/L in addition to suggestive symptoms and signs increases the likelihood that the cough may be related to having pneumonia; acute cough (ie, < 3 weeks in duration) is less likely to be caused by a pneumonia when the CRP < 10 mg/L or between 10–50 mg/L in the absence of dyspnea and daily fever.

Pleurisy

Pleurisy was considered to be similar to pneumonia, except that it affected only one side. The pathophysiology was also related to the humoural doctrine. The disease was described as bilious or sanguineous, if the sputum contained bile or blood respectively, or as dry pleurisy in case of dehydration of the lung.

The clinical findings of pleurisy included chest pain, productive cough, tachypnoea, orthopnoea, fever and shivering. Pleuritic pain could extend from the shoulder and clavicle to the suprapubic area. "Pleurisy in the back" was an alarming condition, as the patient would suffer in agony, become tachypnoeic with immediate but little expectoration and pass blood-stained urine. In cases of pleurisy the physician was instructed to assess "if the patient is different in other ways from what is normal".

The therapeutic strategies for pleurisy were almost the same as for pneumonia. Additional treatment was more case-specific, taking into account the type of pleurisy –bilious, sanguineous, dry– and the individual patient –severity of disease, expectoration.

The key to prognosis was expectoration, with " crisis" expected within seven to fourteen days. Removal of purulent sputum was considered to be associated with recovery, since if expectoration failed, thoracic empyema was anticipated. Pneumonia was another possible complication. There were also other prognostic signs. " If the tongue becomes rough at the beginning, recovery from the disease is difficult". However, "if this sign appears when the disease is already advanced… the patient inevitably expectorates blood". If hiccups and haemoptysis were present, the patient could " succumb on the seventh day", but if the patient survived, an empyema formed. The treatise Diseases I describes the death from pleurisy as agonising: "The patient can succeed neither in coughing them up nor in bringing them to maturity, but his bronchial tubes are filled by the phlegm and pus in them. Then, the patient's breathing becomes stertorous, and he exhales rapidly and only from the upper part of his chest; In the end, he becomes completely blocked up, and dies".

### A 50-year old woman with recurrent right-sided chest pain [^115PSmBL]. Chest (2022). Medium credibility.

Case Presentation

A 50-year-old woman was seen in the office for recurrent episodes of cough and right-sided chest pain. She had visited the ED three times in the past 15 months for the same complaint. Each time, the pain started gradually affecting the right lateral chest wall. It was pleuritic and was associated with cough and mild shortness of breath. During these episodes, she reported low-grade fever but denied any night sweats, chills, sputum production, wheezing, or hemoptysis. She was treated with antibiotics and systemic steroids with resolution of her symptoms. The patient was an active smoker with a more than 35-pack year history. She had no known medical condition and was not taking any medication routinely at home. She had no family history of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency or Marfan syndrome.

### Questions and answers on workup diagnosis and risk stratification: a companion document of the 2020 ESC guidelines for the management of acute coronary syndromes in patients presenting without persistent ST-segment elevation [^113SsAv4]. European Heart Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Q14. A 60-year-old patient with a history of CAD presents to the emergency department with chest pain and cough lasting for 2 days. The right-sided thoracic chest pain is persistent, moderate in intensity, non-radiating, and increases in intensity during inspiration. The last episode of chest pain started 8 h prior to admission and the patient is still mildly symptomatic in the emergency department. He is haemodynamically stable and the physical examination is unremarkable. The 12-lead ECG shows T-wave inversion in lead I and aVL, which were already noted in the ECG performed last year. The initial hs-cTn I Architect concentration is very low/undetectable at 2 ng/L (ULN < 26 ng/L). The emergency department intern, a bright young physician who wants to become a cardiologist, challenges you by saying that 'it is obvious that the chest pain does not represent acute MI and no additional investigations or blood tests in this respect are needed'. Is she right?

Yes. NSTEMI, based on the delay between symptom onset and blood test, can be reliably ruled-out with a single very low level of hs-cTn T/I. In addition, unstable angina is extremely unlikely since prolonged ischaemia is expected to lead to some degree of cTn elevation. An alternative diagnosis such as pneumonia/bronchitis should be considered.

Q15. You are supervising the emergency department/chest pain unit (CPU) and see an 80-year-old patient with a history of CAD, prior MI, and hypertensive heart disease presenting with persistent moderate right-sided thoracic chest pain ongoing for 7 h that increases in intensity during exercise and inspiration. In addition, he has mild fever and an increasing productive cough over the last 3 days. He is haemodynamically stable and the initial physical examination reveals rales over the base of the right lung. ECG shows T-wave inversion in V3–V6, which were already noted on the ECG performed 3 years ago. A chest X-ray shows an infiltrate in the right lung suggestive of pneumonia. Your intern is about to order blood cultures (plus legionella and pneumococcus antigen in the urine) and prescribe antibiotics when the hs-cTn T level is reported from the laboratory as elevated. Your intern now asks you if the patient needs treatment for pneumonia, NSTEMI, or both.
