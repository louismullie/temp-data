## Question

When to repeat proteinuria to double check

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking when to repeat proteinuria testing to confirm or monitor disease, and how to choose the right method and timing across different clinical situations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and why proteinuria was measured. Then, I should verify the initial test method and its limitations. Next, I will apply context-specific confirmation rules for CKD, pregnancy, diabetes, glomerular disease, and pediatrics. After that, I need to consider pre-analytical factors that affect variability and how to mitigate them. Finally, I will synthesize a practical decision framework and summarize key thresholds and timelines, making sure I double-check each step against guideline statements and evidence before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context because the reason for testing drives whether and when to repeat proteinuria. Incidental screening in primary care, suspected preeclampsia, diabetes care, CKD follow-up, glomerular disease management, and pediatric nephrotic syndrome each have different confirmation and monitoring cadences, so I need to ensure I match the repeat strategy to the indication before proceeding [^1151kJym] [^115iXzYn] [^112AeHE2] [^111VkELW].

> Next, I should review the initial test method and its accuracy, because semiquantitative dipsticks and even some point-of-care devices have notable false positives and false negatives and often require quantitative confirmation. Wait, let me verify the hierarchy: KDIGO and KDOQI prioritize first-morning ACR as preferred, followed by PCR, with dipsticks as acceptable only when better methods are unavailable, and they explicitly recommend confirming any positive strip with a laboratory ACR or PCR whenever possible, so I should not jump to conclusions based on a single dipstick result alone [^1175ZuJn] [^116DFttY] [^116ecPJu].

> For chronic kidney disease, I need to ensure chronicity before labeling someone with CKD, which means repeating an abnormal ACR or eGFR to demonstrate persistence over at least 3 months. Hold on, I should verify the timing: KDIGO advises repeating within and beyond the 3‑month window to confirm chronicity, and if ACR is 30 mg/g or higher on a random sample, confirm with a first-morning ACR when feasible. I should also remember that a doubling of ACR on a subsequent test exceeds expected variability and warrants evaluation, so I must not interpret a single abnormal value as CKD without confirmation [^1117AbJV] [^1175ZuJn] [^115Z2BeX].

> In pregnancy, I should confirm that routine repetition of proteinuria is not recommended once significant proteinuria compatible with preeclampsia has been established, because management hinges more on blood pressure and end-organ features than on the exact protein quantity. Let me double-check the thresholds: significant proteinuria is defined as at least 300 mg/24 h, protein/creatinine ratio at least 0.3, or dipstick 2+ if confirmatory testing is not available; SOGC advises against repeating proteinuria once preeclampsia is confirmed, and contemporary obstetric reviews emphasize that proteinuria level does not reliably track maternal-fetal risk, so repeating quantification rarely changes management [^115iXzYn] [^112AeHE2] [^116a6eU2].

> For diabetes, I should confirm that an elevated ACR needs replication before making therapeutic decisions. The ADA recommends confirming an ACR greater than 30 mg/g on at least 2 of 3 samples over a 3–6 month interval, ideally using first-morning specimens to reduce variability. NICE-aligned guidance also supports repeating borderline ACR values within about 3 months, whereas marked elevations such as ACR at least 70 mg/mmol generally do not require further confirmation due to their strong association with clinically significant albuminuria, so I need to tailor repeat frequency to the magnitude of abnormality [^117AHsVP] [^111NosL1] [^113YWT6t].

> In glomerular diseases, I should verify that spot UPCR trends are useful but that 24‑hour collections are preferred when immunosuppression is being initiated or changed, and that repeat testing is warranted to validate suspected relapses before escalating therapy. Hold on, I should verify the thresholds: KDIGO suggests using 24‑hour urine to quantify total protein when treatment decisions depend on precise protein excretion, and lupus nephritis guidance recommends repeat biopsy when proteinuria persists or worsens despite appropriate therapy, underscoring the need to confirm disease activity rather than assuming a treatment failure from a single value [^114ZHmzt] [^1167HxwM] [^1138R5em].

> For pediatric nephrotic syndrome, I need to ensure nephrotic-range proteinuria is confirmed quantitatively before starting therapy for a first episode, and I should use first-morning UPCR when possible. Let me check the definitions: IPNA and KDIGO define nephrotic-range proteinuria as UPCR at least 2 g/g or equivalent, and they recommend confirming with a first-morning sample or a 24‑hour collection if needed; for monitoring, trends in first-morning UPCR are preferred to avoid orthostatic and diurnal variability, so I should repeat testing to establish a baseline before treatment decisions [^111VkELW] [^116e8DAv] [^111RUe36].

> I will now examine pre-analytical and biological variability because these factors often explain discordant results and guide when to repeat. First-morning samples reduce orthostatic and diurnal effects, and avoiding recent exercise, acute illness, menstruation, and dehydration helps minimize transient albuminuria; if the clinical picture is discordant, I should repeat using a first-morning ACR or PCR and consider averaging results across 2–3 measurements to distinguish signal from noise, especially when values are near decision thresholds [^1175ZuJn] [^111c4Bwr] [^116DFttY].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision framework and double-check it aligns with guidelines. If the initial test is a dipstick, I should confirm with ACR or PCR promptly. If the initial test is already ACR/PCR, I should repeat to confirm persistence before diagnosing CKD or changing therapy, using first-morning samples when possible. If the clinical stakes are high, such as suspected preeclampsia or active glomerular disease, I should expedite confirmatory testing rather than waiting. And if results are unexpectedly high or low, I should verify with a different method or a timed collection before acting, keeping in mind that a doubling of ACR or a greater than 20–30% change in eGFR exceeds expected variability and warrants evaluation [^1175ZuJn] [^1117AbJV] [^112g2Y3D].

> But wait, what if the patient is on an agent that rapidly alters proteinuria, like an SGLT2 inhibitor or renin-angiotensin blockade? Should I repeat sooner to document change? Yes, I should consider more frequent measurements early after therapy changes to distinguish true effect from variability, while recognizing that short-term fluctuations can mislead if I rely on a single value. Averaging across 2–3 first-morning samples over 1–2 weeks can improve reliability when I need to verify early response or safety signals [^111c4Bwr] [^1175ZuJn].

> Finally, I should confirm key thresholds and timelines to avoid misclassification. For CKD, repeat an abnormal ACR or eGFR to demonstrate persistence over at least 3 months and confirm ACR 30 mg/g or higher with a first-morning sample when feasible. For diabetes, confirm an elevated ACR on 2 of 3 tests over 3–6 months. For pregnancy, significant proteinuria is at least 300 mg/24 h or protein/creatinine ratio at least 0.3, and routine repetition after confirmation is not advised. For children, confirm nephrotic-range UPCR at least 2 g/g before initiating therapy. And across settings, a doubling of ACR or a greater than 20% change in eGFR should trigger reassessment rather than automatic escalation, ensuring that I am responding to real change rather than noise [^1117AbJV] [^113oert1] [^115iXzYn] [^116e8DAv] [^112g2Y3D].

Repeat proteinuria testing when the initial result is **unexpected or inconsistent with the clinical context** [^1175ZuJn] [^116TajHp], or when using a less accurate method (e.g. dipstick) [^116ecPJu]. Confirm elevated ACR or PCR with a **first-morning sample** [^1175ZuJn] within 1–2 weeks, and repeat testing over 3 months to establish chronicity before diagnosing CKD [^1117AbJV] [^1116nrVX]. In pregnancy, confirm significant proteinuria with a **protein-to-creatinine ratio or 24-hour collection** [^112AeHE2] if dipstick is ≥ 1+ [^112fVC2m], and do not repeat once preeclampsia is confirmed [^115iXzYn] [^116a6eU2]. For diabetes, confirm elevated ACR on **2 of 3 samples over 3–6 months** [^113oert1] [^113YWT6t]. Always repeat after resolving transient factors (UTI, exercise, menstruation) [^111NosL1] and when results will alter management [^111rAoay].

## Factors influencing the decision to repeat proteinuria testing

Several factors **influence the decision** to repeat proteinuria testing:

- **Clinical context**: CKD, diabetes, pregnancy, and transient factors [^1175ZuJn] [^1116nrVX].
- **Initial test method**: Accuracy and reliability of the initial test [^116ecPJu] [^1164PAs7].
- **Patient population**: Age, comorbidities, and risk factors [^1118bEds] [^1114ry3p].
- **Management implications**: Whether results will alter clinical decisions [^111rAoay] [^111ddn4e].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

- **KDIGO 2024**: Repeat testing to confirm CKD; use first-morning samples; confirm elevated ACR/PCR with subsequent measurements [^1175ZuJn] [^1117AbJV].
- **American Diabetes Association (ADA)**: Confirm elevated ACR on 2 of 3 samples over 3–6 months [^113oert1] [^117AHsVP].
- **Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada (SOGC)**: Confirm significant proteinuria with protein-to-creatinine ratio or 24-hour collection; do not repeat once preeclampsia is confirmed [^115iXzYn] [^112fVC2m].

---

## Conclusion and practical recommendations

Repeat proteinuria testing when initial results are unexpected, inconsistent, or obtained with less accurate methods. Confirm elevated ACR or PCR with a **first-morning sample** [^1175ZuJn] within 1–2 weeks, and repeat over 3 months to establish chronicity before diagnosing CKD [^1117AbJV]. In pregnancy, confirm significant proteinuria with a **protein-to-creatinine ratio or 24-hour collection** [^112AeHE2] if dipstick is ≥ 1+ [^112fVC2m], and do not repeat once preeclampsia is confirmed [^115iXzYn]. For diabetes, confirm elevated ACR on **2 of 3 samples over 3–6 months** [^117AHsVP]. Always repeat after resolving transient factors and when results will change management [^111rAoay].

Monitoring lupus nephritis activity — The gold standard for assessing proteinuria, the 24-hour urine collection, is challenging to implement in clinical practice; random urine protein-to-creatinine ratios are usually adequate. The first void of the day sample is the most accurate for the spot urine collection but may not be feasible, and unexpected results on random testing should be followed by a 24-hour collection, especially before any change in therapy. In people with LN who have not achieved CRR, we strongly recommend quantifying proteinuria at least every 3 months; in people with LN in sustained clinical renal remission, we strongly recommend quantifying proteinuria every 3–6 months.

### Monitoring for proteinuria in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^116T6bvC]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2015). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Nephropathy is an established complication in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Common risk factors for renal disease include older age, men, ethnic minority status, cigarette smoking, hypertension, and poor glycemic control. The UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guideline on diabetes recommends at least annual monitoring of patients with T2DM for proteinuria.

Proteinuria may be monitored qualitatively, using a dipstick method, or quantitatively by assessing 24 h or a spot urine for urinary protein or albumin. Owing to different detection limits and different false-positive and false-negative rates in albuminuria test methods, the NICE guideline recommends repeating a urinary test if an abnormal albumin: creatinine ratio is obtained at each of the next two clinic visits but within a maximum of 3–4 months. Limited publications are available on the frequency of proteinuria, proteinuria monitoring, and its associations with renal disease risk factors in patients with T2DM.

The purposes of this study were to (1) assess the frequency of proteinuria monitoring in patients with T2DM; (2) understand the association between proteinuria monitoring and renal disease risk factors in patients with T2DM, and whether the frequency of proteinuria testing varies by age, sex, smoking status, history of hypertension, renal complications, and antidiabetic drug therapy; and (3) evaluate the prevalence of proteinuria in patients with T2DM in the UK.

### Should proteinuria reduction be the criterion for antihypertensive drug selection for patients with kidney disease? [^111RVuwX]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Proteinuria, that is, more than 200 mg/day of urinary albumin, is associated with the presence of kidney disease. Its increase over time is strongly correlated with progression of nephropathy. Retrospective analyses of nephropathy outcome trials show that proteinuria reduction of 30% or more after initiation of blood pressure (BP)-lowering therapy is associated with slower nephropathy progression than lowering BP without its reduction.

Recent Findings

Retrospective analyses of five large nephropathy outcome trials demonstrate that nephropathy progression slowed by an additional 28–39% over the control or placebo group when proteinuria was reduced in concert with BP. Two separate trials demonstrate that nephropathy progression was slowed to a lesser degree when BP was reduced to a similar degree, but proteinuria reduced less than 30%. These associations do not hold for those with microalbuminuria, in which BP reduction is the key element to slowing nephropathy progression. Recent cardiovascular outcome trials fail to show a relationship between reductions in proteinuria and nephropathy outcomes. This large cardiovascular endpoint trial, however, was not only powered for nephropathy outcomes but also failed to show a benefit between proteinuria reduction and cardiovascular events, a previously established observation.

Summary

All patients with a history of hypertension and either kidney disease or diabetes should have an annual check for albuminuria. If albumin is present in amounts of more than 200 mg/day, strategies for BP-lowering therapy should also focus on a reduction of more than 30% of urinary protein.

### Heterogeneity in diagnostic criteria for chronic kidney disease of undetermined etiology (CKDu): a systematic review of the literature [^1115Bx6B]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Labelling patients with higher levels of proteinuria as CKDu especially without a kidney biopsy may lead to misclassification of potentially treatable diseases like IgA nephropathy with long term risk of kidney failure and overestimate the CKDu burden. This should be avoided particularly in community-based screening studies where detailed diagnostic workup and kidney biopsy are not feasible. Conversely, the degree of proteinuria varies with age and CKDu patients with advanced disease may have worsening proteinuria due to secondary glomerulosclerosis. Estimation of albumin creatinine ratio or 24-hour urinary protein is resource intensive compared to a urine dipstick test which maybe more cost-effective for screening.

Excluding patients with diabetes, hypertension and advanced age may underestimate the disease burden. Non-traditional causes like obesity associated CKD (e.g. life-time overweight) may be mis-labelled as CKDu. Some diagnostic uncertainty is also expected if kidney biopsy is an essential criterion for confirmation of CKDu particularly in patients with advanced disease and in resource limited settings. Comprehensive work-up for exclusion of all known causes of CKD is also resource intensive and may not always be feasible in LMICs where CKDu is predominantly reported. Restricting the diagnosis to populations in certain geographies or certain occupations can prevent identification of new clusters of CKDu.

Considering these complexities, the definition of CKDu should be more nuanced and stratified according to the research goals and clinical scope. Proteinuria and hypertension should be strictly excluded as required by the DEGREE protocol in community-based screening studies to avoid overestimation of the disease. More liberal definitions for hypertension and proteinuria maybe considered especially in those with advanced disease in hospital settings. However, this should incorporate a well-defined diagnostic algorithm to exclude other causes of CKD highlighting the need for a kidney biopsy for confirmation. A single measurement for kidney function may suffice for screening, but repeat testing after 3 months should be reinforced for cohort and case-control studies, hospital-based protocols and for further patient management. eGFR should be interpreted cautiously in South Asian populations in whom the equations have not been validated which may lead to differential bias when comparing with other ethnic populations. Relying solely on serum creatinine without estimating GFR to define CKD may underestimate disease prevalence.

3 MEASUREMENT

3.1 Measurement technique and urine sample type

Historically, urinary protein assessment relied on measuring 24‐h total protein excretion. Advances in the understanding of kidney disease, as reflected in the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) 2012 guideline, shifted the focus to albuminuria, recognising it as the predominant urinary protein in most kidney diseases. These recommendations have been retained in the updated KDIGO 2024 guidelines, further reinforcing the clinical importance of albuminuria assessment. Measuring urinary albumin, now widely recommended, is a relatively standardised and sensitive procedure that improves the sensitivity, quality and consistency of kidney disease detection and management. Although total protein measurements are less expensive, they lack the sensitivity to detect low but clinically significant levels of albuminuria, leading to their replacement by albumin‐specific assays (Table 1).

TABLE 1
Comparison of albuminuria measurement methods.

Albuminuria can be assessed using semi‐quantitative dipstick tests, particularly in resource‐limited settings. These reagent strips provide a quick, inexpensive and convenient screening method but have limited sensitivity and specificity, partly due to their inability to account for urine concentration or dilution. While these tests may eventually facilitate at‐home monitoring for CKD patients, they should currently be regarded as preliminary tools requiring confirmation through laboratory‐based methods to ensure accurate diagnosis and effective clinical decision‐making.

While 24‐h urine collection is the gold standard for assessing albuminuria due to its ability to account for variations in urine tonicity and the circadian rhythm of urinary albumin excretion, practical limitations often necessitate alternative methods. Although 24‐h urine collections provide comprehensive data, including assessments of muscle mass (via 24‐h creatinine excretion) and dietary intake (sodium and protein intake measured through sodium and urea excretion, respectively), they are labour‐intensive and prone to errors such as incomplete collection. Timed overnight collections are less cumbersome while still covering a reasonable collection interval; however, compliance remains poor compared to spot urine sampling. These challenges have led to the widespread adoption of more practical methods, including random urine samples, first‐morning voids and early‐morning voids.

### Diagnosis and management of non-metastatic upper tract urothelial carcinoma: AUA / SUO guideline [^112hrdHP]. The Journal of Urology (2023). High credibility.

Upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC) — renal function risk stratification and monitoring: Segmental or endoscopic organ-sparing approaches have been associated with improved postoperative renal function, with differences in eGFR ranging from 14 to 19 mL/min versus nephroureterectomy. Predictive factors for post-operative CKD include older age, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, male sex, obesity, tobacco use, larger tumor size, and post-operative acute kidney injury. Patients who present with eGFR less than 45 mL/ min/1.73m2 or confirmed proteinuria are at particularly HR and should be considered for nephrology consultation, and those expected to have an eGFR less than 30 mL/ min/1.73m2 after intervention will also be at HR long-term and should involve a nephrologist. Optimizing glycemic and blood pressure control, smoking cessation, and minimizing risk of acute kidney injury with avoidance of hypotension and nephrotoxic agents should reduce perioperative renal dysfunction; patients with DM are at even higher risk for acute kidney injury compared with those without DM. Repeat assessment of blood pressure, eGFR, and proteinuria should be performed soon after nephrectomy then again in three to six months, and with any compromise in eGFR or CKD complications, additional regular monitoring and referral to nephrology are recommended.

### KDOQI US commentary on the KDIGO clinical practice guideline for the prevention, diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of hepatitis C in CKD [^114NtWkR]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2008). Medium credibility.

KDOQI US commentary on KDIGO hepatitis C in chronic kidney disease — posttransplant management and antiviral therapy indicates that all conventional current maintenance immunosuppressive regimens can be considered for use in HCV-infected kidney transplant recipients. It is suggested that HCV-infected kidney transplant recipients more than 6 months after transplantation have their liver disease evaluated at least annually. It is suggested that HCV-infected kidney transplant recipients be screened for the development of new-onset diabetes mellitus after transplantation and be tested at least every 3 to 6 months for proteinuria. It is suggested that patients who develop new-onset proteinuria (either urine protein/creatinine ratio > 1 or 24-hour urine protein greater than 1 g on 2 or more occasions) have an allograft biopsy with immunofluorescence and electron microscopy included in the analysis. For HCV-infected kidney transplant recipients in whom the benefits of antiviral treatment clearly outweigh the risks, monotherapy with standard IFN is suggested, and because of the risk of rejection, kidney transplant recipients with HCV-associated glomerulopathy not receive IFN-based therapy unless the benefits of therapy outweigh the risks of treatment. After transplantation, HCV-infected kidney transplant recipients should be monitored for the development of liver disease, hyperglycemia, and proteinuria.

### Diagnostic accuracy of spot urinary protein and albumin to creatinine ratios for detection of significant proteinuria or adverse pregnancy outcome in patients with suspected pre-eclampsia: systematic review and meta-analysis [^116AjnBq]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Pre-eclampsia is a major cause of maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality that complicates 2–8% of all pregnancies. It is a multisystem endothelial disease that leads to glomeruloendotheliosis, and in severe cases it may lead to renal impairment and failure. "Permeability" of the glomerular basement membrane to proteins, including albumin, is key to the diagnosis. The presence of significant proteinuria (in addition to hypertension) predisposes a pregnant woman to coagulopathy, liver disease, and stroke. Serious perinatal morbidity occurs in the form of preterm delivery (often iatrogenic) and fetal growth restriction. The diagnosis of pre-eclampsia (International Society for the Study of Hypertension in Pregnancy) is determined by the presence of elevated blood pressure combined with significant proteinuria (≥ 0.3 g/24 hours) after the 20th week of gestation in a previously normotensive, non-proteinuric patient. One of the "cornerstones" of antenatal care includes a screening programme directed at the detection of pre-eclampsia with regular measurements of blood pressure and urinalysis for proteinuria (often using urinalysis dipsticks). The "dipstick analysis", using visual reagent strips, is quick, portable, and easy to do. However, urine samples are taken at varying times of the day. This test is complicated by relatively high false positive and false negative rates, so it is almost always followed up by the "gold standard" test of 24 hour urine collection. This test is in itself not without problems. The collection is cumbersome, time consuming, inconvenient (to patients as well as hospital staff), and subject to errors such as incomplete collection leading to inaccuracies (in 13–68% of collections). Delays may occur in the institution of a management plan while results are awaited, and verification of diagnosis of pre-eclampsia may not be possible if patients deliver before the urine collection is complete. The laboratory assay methods used also vary widely, and the incidence of significant proteinuria has been shown to vary depending on the assay used.

### Screening for chronic kidney disease: change of perspective and novel developments [^1116nrVX]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

DIAGNOSTIC TESTS FOR CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE SCREENING

Various measurement methods are available to detect CKD early. A scoping review by Okpechi et al. from 2021 reported that methods for early CKD identification widely vary. This variation exists in the type of measurement (kidney function, albuminuria, proteinuria), the number of measurements (only once or more), and applied definitions of abnormalities [e.g. CKD diagnosis based only on estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), severely increased albuminuria, or both]. This has implications for the reported prevalences, diagnostic yield, and therapeutic consequences of screening. Efforts should thus be undertaken to standardize methods for early detection.

Since 2012, CKD has been defined by abnormalities of the kidney structure or kidney function, present for at least 3 months with implications for health, and this definition has been widely accepted. The consensus is, therefore, that CKD screening should consist of dual assessment, in clinical practice most often measured by the eGFR and damage to the kidney structure, characterized by increased albuminuria, that is, the urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR). Importantly, measurements should be repeated within and beyond the 3-month period to confirm the diagnosis and chronicity.

### Interpreting abnormal proteinuria in pregnancy: the need for a more pathophysiological approach [^1151fJ6e]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2010). Low credibility.

This review and opinion article focuses on the definitions and meanings of abnormal protein excretion in pregnancy, asking the following questions: Are our tests to determine abnormal proteinuria adequately performed? Are current guidelines for diagnosis of excessive proteinuria, especially when used to identify preeclampsia, supported by adequate data? Can the magnitude of proteinuria be used as a reliable clinical biomarker of the gravity of preeclampsia? Should timed urine collections, primarily 24-hour excretions, be supplanted by the urine protein/creatinine ratio in clinical practice? The answers to most of these questions are: We are not sure, or some guidelines are poorly supported by data and may prove erroneous. We suggest a more physiologic approach to assessment of proteinuria and believe that if clinicians and investigators looked at proteinuria in terms of how the kidney handles protein in health and disease it would lead to a more rational and evidence-based approach to proteinuria in pregnancy. Finally, we recommend that current cutoff for abnormal proteinuria be used to diagnose preeclampsia, but the level of proteinuria should not guide management. Other variables, such as status of blood pressure control, evidence of increasing organ damage in the liver and hematological systems, evidence of falling glomerular filtration rate, and signs of neurological involvement, are more reliable indicators of severity of preeclampsia.

### Excessive urinary tract dilatation and proteinuria in pregnancy: a common and overlooked association? [^111dDfTp]. BMC Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

Therefore, we will limit our report to the description of an association that might be more frequent than previously reported, possibly because of a trigger effect of pregnancy on the development of proteinuria in the context of various kidney diseases, including symptomatic or severe urinary tract dilatation. As urinary picture normalized in all patients after delivery and ureteral stent removal; it was impossible to disentangle the effect of each ones. However, the clinical relevance in the differential diagnosis with preeclampsia is unaffected by the cause of proteinuria.

A role for the increase in abdominal pressure may be postulated, together with a facilitating role of the urinary tract infections, where present. However, possibly to the negative selection of the cases, mentioned above, a clear-cut relationship was not identified.

Pregnancy may facilitate the development of proteinuria in the context of severe-symptomatic urinary tract dilatation via the changes in the metabolic milieu, through hyperfiltration or both, thus suggesting to further investigate in these fields. One possible explanation is that proteinuria increases steadily in pregnant women as the levels of the soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1(sFlt-1) rise, whose effect on podocytes is to increase proteinuria. Patients with chronic interstitial nephritis might have reached the tubular maximum of reabsorbtion and display proteinuria near term, when circulating sFlt-1 is at its highest.

The striking association with ureteral stenting in our series needs further confirmation on a larger scale; indeed, there is a strong selection bias, as only the most symptomatic cases usually undergo invasive procedures. A role of iatrogenic vescico-ureteral reflux (linked to the presence of a ureteral stent) in the persistence of tubular damage (and/or of the inflammatory changes associated with urinary reflux and infection) can be postulated, but once again this awaits further confirmation in a prospective larger-scale analysis.

Our study has several limitations, partly shared by other observational studies in pregnancy: the problem of low grade proteinuria is very important in particular in a situation in which the upper physiological limits "touch" the limit for the definition of a severe disease (pre-eclampsia). Hence, we may have missed some cases with low-grade proteinuria and urinary tract dilatation, who tested negative at conventional urinalysis; conversely, the cases who tested positive at urinalysis or who were diagnosed with proteinuria at 24 hour urine collections were repeatedly controlled, thus ensuring against false positives (Tables 1, 2).

Diagnosis of nephrotic syndrome in children — urine protein-to-creatinine ratio (UPCR) and albumin thresholds: The substitution of spot UPCR for the 24-hour urine collection has been established as the standard of care for children, with nephrotic-range proteinuria defined as first morning UPCR of ≥ 2 g/g. Whereas the 2012 KDIGO guideline maintained albumin ≤ 2.5 g/dL, the current guideline suggests serum albumin ≤ 3 g/dl; however, we suggest continuing to use the definition of nephrotic syndrome for children in the absence of evidence to support a change to a higher cutoff. It is unknown whether children with nephrotic-range proteinuria and less severe hypoalbuminemia (albumin of 2.6–2.9 g/dL) have similar pathology or treatment responses, and this has not been studied in prospective clinical trials. Practice Point 4.1.1 states that the definitions relating to nephrotic syndrome in children are based on the clinical characteristics outlined in Figure 39.

### Urine protein: creatinine ratio vs 24-hour urine protein for proteinuria management: analysis from the phase 3 REFLECT study of lenvatinib vs sorafenib in hepatocellular carcinoma [^115B6VH2]. British Journal of Cancer (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The mechanism underlying VEGFR-inhibitor-associated proteinuria are unclear, but may involve thrombotic microangiopathy or impairment of podocyte function. However, proteinuria is a manageable adverse event that does not typically lead to clinically meaningful adverse outcomes if it is appropriately monitored and managed. The regression model of the UPCR versus 24-hour urine protein data suggests a strong and statistically significant correlation between the 2 measurements, and using a UPCR cut-off value of 2.4 to delineate between grade 2 and 3 proteinuria and the need for further testing would obviate the need for the more burdensome 24-hour urine collection for an estimated 74% of patients with urine protein dipstick results of ≥ 2+.

Introduction of UPCR into the guidelines for proteinuria management could be as follows and as described in Supplementary Table 2: urine dipstick testing would be performed as regularly scheduled. A 24-hour urine collection or an immediate spot UPCR test would be required in the case of: (1) first occurrence of ≥ 2+ proteinuria while on lenvatinib; (2) a subsequent increase in severity of urine dipstick proteinuria while on the same dose level; (3) when following a lenvatinib dose reduction, the urine protein dipstick result was ≥ 2+. In addition, a 24-hour urine collection should be initiated as soon as possible (within 72 h) when UPCR is ≥ 2.4 to verify the grade of proteinuria. After the proteinuria has improved to a lower grade, lenvatinib may be restarted at a reduced dose. By following these criteria, proteinuria can be safely managed, enabling optimisation of lenvatinib treatment while minimising inconvenience to patients. It should also be noted that, although this analysis was conducted in patients with HCC, this monitoring approach may potentially be useful in other tumour types treated with lenvatinib (e.g. differentiated thyroid cancer or renal cell carcinoma).

### Remission of proteinuria in primary glomerulonephritis: we know the goal but do we know the price? [^114quB7t]. Nature Clinical Practice: Nephrology (2008). Medium credibility.

Membranous nephropathy, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis and IgA nephropathy are the most commonly recognized types of primary glomerulonephritis that progress to end-stage renal disease. Persistent proteinuria is a major determinant of such progression. Reduction of proteinuria slows progression of renal disease and improves renal survival, but many of the agents used to reduce proteinuria carry a considerable risk of toxicity. The assessment of benefit versus risk of these medications can be further complicated by the temporal disconnect between the onset of benefit and of serious adverse events. In addition, relapses are common in these disorders and there is often a need for retreatment. Such retreatment might lead to repeated and/or prolonged drug exposure and to the oversight or underestimation of the cumulative dose of these agents because of the potentially extended interval between relapses. Consequently, it is very important to constantly review each patient's status and take into account their age, comorbid conditions and cumulative drug exposure when assessing treatment options. The potentially delayed development of adverse events also emphasizes the need for long-term surveillance of patients who receive immunosuppressive treatment for glomerular disease, often well beyond their drug exposure period and even when the treatment has been successful.

### Optimization of screening strategy for chronic kidney disease by urine test strips using the albumin-creatinine read-out [^1164PAs7]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Given that the semi-quantitative ACR is the only readout demonstrating positive and negative likelihood ratios of 11.3 and 0.11, respectively, this readout should be preferred in CKD screening algorithms when urine test strips are used. These results are confirmed by the high predictive probability of ACR for CKD as compared to semi-quantitative PCR and qualitative PCR. Additionally, the agreement between the KDIGO CKD-risk score classification based on eGFR and semi-quantitative and quantitative ACR indicates that the semi-quantitative results obtained with the test strip are reliable. However, reporting the category in which the patient is classified has limited diagnostic value and should primarily serve as an indication for quantitative ACR determination. The CKD stage assigned based on semi-quantitative test strip results may necessitate confirmation by quantitative analysis.

Although it is clear that quantitative ACR is the best parameter for evaluating albuminuria in CKD, especially in high-risk patients, there is still debate on the appropriate screening technique in lower-risk patients. Lamb et al. examined several algorithms for detecting proteinuria and concluded that urinary albumin measurement is analytically superior to total urinary protein measurement and should be prioritized as first-line test for detecting proteinuria due to its higher sensitivity, standardization, and ability to improve the consistency of early CKD detection. Furthermore, they stated that semi-quantitative test strips have low sensitivity and clinical reliability, resulting in false-negative results and variation between laboratories. Recent evidence from Salinas et al. demonstrated that a semiquantitative ACR strip test can effectively identify pathological albuminuria values under certain conditions, with false negatives below 1% and significant cost savings by eliminating the need for unnecessary quantitative confirmation in up to 40% of cases. However, in the current KDIGO and National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines, multiple options for the detection of proteinuria are presented without further defining whether quantitative or semi-quantitative test strip results should be used to screen for albuminuria or proteinuria in the general population. The recently updated EFLM European urinalysis guideline 2023 proposes using multi-property urine test strips as a screening tool for CKD in routine patient populations, followed by a quantitative test to confirm the diagnosis. According to recent data, only a small percentage of clinical laboratories use test strips to screen for ACR in Belgium. Total protein readout remains the standard screening read-out on test strips in the majority of clinical laboratories. However, our data demonstrate that protein readout may be suboptimal, and screening by the ACR pad on the urine test strip may be a more effective strategy.

### Association of persistent, incident, and remittent proteinuria with stroke risk in patients with diabetes mellitus or prediabetes mellitus [^113k5HGY]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Annual screenings of proteinuria are suggested for diabetic and prediabetic populations. 27 Despite the wide availability and ease of use in the clinical setting, few studies have used urine dipsticks to screen changes in proteinuria and assess their value in the prediction of stroke. Assessing proteinuria using the simple dipstick test could be a convenient way to reflect an individual's systematic vasculature permeability and susceptibility to target organ damage. 28 Our results suggest that repeating the dipstick screening at 2‐year intervals for detection of proteinuria change has added value in the identification of individuals at higher risk for stroke, especially for those who have incident and persistent proteinuria. These findings are potentially clinically important since dipstick measuring is easy and relatively inexpensive compared with other methods for stratifying stroke risk and monitoring the effectiveness of preventive measures among diabetic and prediabetic populations.

The mechanisms linking proteinuria to stroke risk remain obscure. The Steno hypothesis suggests that proteinuria not only reflects localized renal damage but is also an independent marker of systemic vascular endothelial dysfunction or microvascular disease. 29 Proteinuria is associated with several inflammatory and thrombogenic factors, which play important roles in the development of atherosclerosis and stroke. 5, 23 Insulin resistance is also suggested to play an important role in the increased cardiovascular risk conferred by proteinuria. 30 Otherwise, proteinuria is associated with a high prevalence of traditional cardiovascular risk factors, such as hypertension and diabetes mellitus. Proteinuria may be a sign of shared risk factors for vascular disease rather than a direct cause of new strokes. Changes in urine protein over time may be an indicator of the severity of stroke risk factors. In diabetic and prediabetic populations, proteinuria may largely reflect diabetes mellitus control. In addition, patients with renal damage frequently receive fewer prevention approaches for stroke. 5

Study Strengths and Limitations

The strengths of our study include the prospective design, use of a large cohort, long follow‐up period, and use of changes in proteinuria to estimate the risk of stroke. However, our results should be interpreted in the context of some limitations. First, participants in our analysis were from a Chinese population and had either diabetes mellitus or prediabetes mellitus. Thus, our findings cannot be directly generalized to other populations and will need confirmation from other studies. Second, there are limitations of using a dipstick test. The dipstick method could overlook proteinuria. 1 A timed 24‐hour urine collection or albumin:creatinine ratio might be more precise in measuring proteinuria, although the dipstick method has a cost advantage. 31

### Proteinuria in children [^115kGw5q]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Proteinuria is common in children and may represent a benign condition or a serious underlying renal disease or systemic disorder. Proteinuria may occur secondary to glomerular or tubular dysfunction. Although a 24-hour urine protein excretion test is usually recommended, it may be impractical in children. A spot, first-morning urine test for protein/creatinine ratio can be useful in this situation. Proteinuria is usually benign, in the form of transient or orthostatic proteinuria. Persistent proteinuria may be associated with more serious renal diseases. Clinical features from the history, physical examination, and laboratory tests help determine the cause of proteinuria. Treatment should be directed at the underlying cause. Patients with active urinary sediments, persistent and gross hematuria, hypertension, hypocomplementemia, renal insufficiency with depressed glomerular filtration rate, or signs and symptoms suggestive of vasculitic disease may require a renal biopsy and referral to a pediatric nephrologist.

### Testing for chronic kidney disease: a position statement from the National Kidney Foundation [^1143hH3P]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is common in the United States. The estimated prevalence of CKD in US adults was 11.7% ± 0.8% in 2000, based on the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Global estimates for CKD prevalence are less certain, but recent studies in Europe, Australia, and China suggest a high prevalence. The most common risk factors for CKD include diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, a family history of CKD, and age greater than 60 years. Major outcomes of CKD include progression to kidney failure, development of complications of impaired kidney function, and increased risk for cardiovascular disease. CKD is usually silent until its late stages, thus many patients with CKD are detected only shortly before the onset of symptomatic kidney failure, when there are few opportunities to prevent adverse outcomes. Earlier detection allows for more time for evaluation and treatment but requires explicit testing strategies for asymptomatic individuals at increased risk. In the majority of patients, CKD can be detected with 2 simple tests: a urine test for the detection of proteinuria and a blood test to estimate the glomerular filtration rate (GFR). These 2 tests facilitate detection of CKD by all physicians by allowing for identification of CKD without first requiring determination of its cause. Understanding the strengths and limitations of CKD testing is critical for appropriate implementation of these recommendations. Application of CKD testing in national and international screening and surveillance programs could improve public health related to CKD.

### Value of repeat renal biopsy in the evaluation of AL amyloidosis patients lacking renal response despite of complete hematologic remission: a case report and literature review [^112VDD4E]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

Backgrounds

Published literatures on repeat renal biopsy of AL amyloidosis have basically reached a consensus that amyloid material deposit does not disappear or diminish after satisfactory hematologic response, regardless of renal response. However, the need of a repeat renal biopsy in such situation is still controversial.

Case presentation

Here we reported a case of histologically confirmed λ Type renal AL amyloidosis who had been classified as Stage I and low risk at initial diagnosis. The patient received a total of six courses of CyBorD chemotherapy. She had achieved complete hematologic remission after two courses of chemotherapy but consistently had large amount of proteinuria over 10 g/day during follow up. A repeat renal biopsy was performed nine months after the first one and indicated mild to moderate increase of amyloid deposits as well as significant glomerulosclerosis and interstitial lesions, suggesting a lack of histological renal improvement despite her satisfactory hematologic response.

Conclusions

This case indicated renal involvement in AL amyloidosis could progress after successful hematologic treatment, and supported the value of repeat renal biopsy in the evaluation of AL amyloidosis patients lacking renal response despite of complete hematologic remission.

### Primary care approach to proteinuria [^114Jxx65]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Proteinuria is a common finding in primary care practice. Most adolescents who are diagnosed with proteinuria through screening urinalysis do not have renal disease, and the proteinuria will usually resolve on repeat testing. In contrast, proteinuria is suggestive of kidney disease in patients with diabetes mellitus, hypertension, primary renal disease, or other systemic illnesses. Quantification of proteinuria can be used longitudinally to monitor therapeutic effects of treatment of the underlying disease. Given the multitude of clinical settings in which proteinuria can occur, we suggest an algorithm that may help clinicians differentiate between benign and serious etiologies of proteinuria.

### Improving proteinuria screening with mailed smartphone urinalysis testing in previously unscreened patients with hypertension: a randomized controlled trial [^115cU2uz]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Another issue in our trial was that very few patients with trace or 1+ protein underwent confirmation testing by quantitative ACR or protein/creatinine ratio, over a relatively short follow-up period. Having learned how to use their smartphones to analyze the urine dipstick at home, it would have been intuitive to send an additional home testing kit to confirm whether ACR was elevated or not. Unfortunately, the Healthy.io semi-quantitative ACR home test was not available at the time of the trial, which could be an effective adjunct to confirm albuminuria at home. It seems likely that traveling to the laboratory for confirmation testing posed an additional barrier. Future studies should explore strategies where screening and confirmation of albuminuria is done solely using home testing kits.

Other studies have described similarly suboptimal rates of screening among patients at risk of CKD and even patients with eGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73m 2. For example, in a study of stage 3–4 CKD patients receiving care from 2004 to 2008 in a group practice in eastern Massachusetts, only 30% had annual urine protein monitoring completed. Even in an optimal setting where clinical decision support in the form of a CKD checklist embedded in the EHR was implemented in a prospective study, annual ACR measurement still was only able to be improved to 73%. Thus, use of home testing may have a role in further improving adherence to albuminuria/proteinuria screening.

There were several limitations in this proof-of-concept study. Due to the requirement of having a smartphone to test the urinalyses, we limited our mostly white, patient population to active patient portal users, and results may not be generalizable to non-portal users. While smartphone ownership has risen from 35% in 2011 to 77% in 2018, other screening strategies may also be needed to reach those without access to smartphones. It is possible that some dipstick protein results could be false negatives or false positives, and we lacked repeat testing on most abnormal dipstick protein results. Whether or not early detection of albuminuria can improve outcomes will require future large-scale studies with longer follow-up and consideration of strategies to increase patient engagement and provider adherence to clinical guidelines for albuminuria.

- Repeat urinalysis as a first a. m. void along with a urine protein/creatinine ratio in patients noted to have proteinuria on a random urinalysis.

A positive screening result for new-onset hypertension during pregnancy is defined as an elevated blood pressure reading (systolic blood pressure ≥ 140 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 90 mm Hg) in the absence of chronic hypertension or kidney disease measured at least 4 hours apart. Screening evaluations include testing for proteinuria when preeclampsia is suspected; however, the USPSTF found that point-of-care tests for protein in the urine had low accuracy, and evidence does not support routine point-of-care urine tests to screen for preeclampsia because proteinuria alone may not be a good predictor of preeclampsia health outcomes. Protein measurement is not used in the diagnostic criteria for preeclampsia.

Review of assays to assess albuminuria

Table 8
Definitions of albuminuria a

The JNC 7, the National Kidney Foundation (NKF), and the ADA all recommend the use of morning spot albumin/creatinine measurement for annual quantitative testing for urine albumin in adults with diabetes. Individuals should be fasting. The optimal time for spot urine collection is the early morning, but for minimizing variation, all collections should be at the same time of day; the individual preferably should not have ingested food for at least 2 h.

Positive test results represent "albuminuria" in these guidelines, corresponding to protein excretion of > 300 mg/24 h, > 200 μg/min, or > 300 mg/g creatinine (Table 8). In these patients, quantitative measurement of urine albumin excretion is used in assessing the severity of albuminuria and its progression, in planning treatment, and in determining the impact of therapy. To properly assess the stage of kidney disease, the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) can be calculated from the serum creatinine value, age, sex, and race of the patient. An eGFR of < 60 mL/min, regardless of the presence of low levels of albuminuria, is an independent cardiovascular risk factor. A urine albumin value of < 30 mg/g creatinine, although considered "normal", should be reassessed annually, because values as low as 10 mg/g creatinine have been associated in some studies with an increased cardiovascular risk. If the value is ≥ 30 mg/g creatinine, changes should be reassessed after 6 to 12 months if antihypertensve therapy is required or annually in those who are normotensive. For children with type 1 diabetes, testing for low levels of albuminuria is recommended to begin after puberty and after a diabetes duration of 5 years. Of note is that most longitudinal cohort studies have reported significant increases in the prevalence of low levels of albuminuria only after diabetes has been present for 5 years.

In the algorithms of both the NKF and the ADA for urine protein testing, the diagnosis of low levels of albuminuria requires both the demonstration of increased albumin excretion (as defined above) on two of three tests repeated at intervals of 3 to 6 months and the exclusion of conditions that "invalidate" the test (Fig. 1).

TABLE 2
KDIGO albuminuria categories in CKD.

The continuous relationship between albuminuria and risk underscores that reference thresholds for ACR are not absolute disease indicators but rather markers within a spectrum of risk. Current albuminuria cut‐offs serve as practical benchmarks but lack the precision derived from prospective intervention studies needed to define optimal values, as has been done for blood pressure. Consequently, albuminuria thresholds should be regarded as global tools for guiding clinical decision‐making rather than definitive disease markers.

3.3 Variability

Albuminuria exhibits significant day‐to‐day variability within individuals due to fluctuations in blood pressure, exercise, diet and posture. Although these factors contribute to variability, they account for only a small fraction of its overall magnitude. This variability affects diagnostic consistency, as an individual's albuminuria status may fluctuate across days, potentially crossing diagnostic thresholds. Abnormal values should therefore be confirmed on at least one separate occasion to definitively establish increased albuminuria. Furthermore, according to KDIGO guidelines, chronicity must be demonstrated to diagnose CKD. This requires evidence of persistent abnormalities over at least 3 months, necessitating repeat ACR measurements beyond this period. Abnormal results at a single time point should not be assumed to reflect CKD, as they may indicate transient conditions such as acute kidney injury or acute kidney disease.

Within‐individual variability in albuminuria also complicates the assessment of therapeutic efficacy. Short‐term changes in ACR following the initiation of albuminuria‐lowering drugs may partly reflect random fluctuations rather than true treatment effects. This variability poses challenges in interpreting drug responses. Therefore, repeated measurements during the early phase of treatment are essential to distinguish genuine drug effects from background variability. Individualised monitoring is crucial for optimising therapeutic regimens, including dose adjustments and the addition of adjunctive therapies, to achieve target reductions in albuminuria. Long‐term disease monitoring must also account for ACR variability. Changes in ACR should not be interpreted as definitive evidence of disease progression or remission without confirmatory testing and consideration of the clinical context. Misinterpreting single measurements may lead to premature treatment adjustments or misclassification of prognosis, which should be avoided.

In clinical trials, it is also crucial to account for this day‐to‐day variability of albuminuria when evaluating treatment effects. Previous studies have demonstrated that collecting multiple urine samples per individual across several study visits significantly improves the statistical power to detect an intervention's effect size on albuminuria. This approach reduces the required sample size for intervention trials and decreases screen failure rates caused by variability‐driven misclassification.

Point of care testing

The KDIGO 2024 CKD Guideline endorses point of care testing (POCT) for creatinine measurements given the convenience associated with this in some settings, and place less value on the diagnostic accuracy. Given the need to improve the rate of detection of CKD in the community, even in Europe where most health systems are relatively robust, POCT may be an important tool to improve the rates of case finding. POCT for urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (uACR) may be similarly convenient and would permit more complete CKD staging in appropriately selected individuals.

The key practice points from the KDIGO 2024 CKD Guideline are summarized in Table 1. A detailed discussion of the accuracy of POCT devices for creatinine and uACR is beyond the scope of this article, but as discussed in the KDIGO 2024 CKD Guideline, it is important to highlight the potential drawbacks especially in regions where resources may permit more accurate testing. Given the relevant concerns regarding accuracy of the various devices for both creatinine and albuminuria, the potential benefits and harms should be considered and individualized. As with any test it is important that the test is performed when indicated, in patients at risk of CKD. Importantly, a diagnosis of CKD cannot be made on single testing and must be confirmed through nephrology consultation of suspicion of advanced CKD or repeat testing in individuals with higher eGFR and/or lower levels of albuminuria.

Table 1:
KDIGO practice points on POCT for kidney function.

The potential benefits of POCT, as outlined in the KDIGO 2024 CKD Guideline, include the convenience for the patient and the rapidity of obtaining the test result, which permit testing in non-clinical environments (nursing homes, remote areas). For individuals, the convenience may outweigh the concerns about accuracy. In children, the tiny volume of blood required may be an additional advantage, especially if used for follow-up testing once a diagnosis is established. The improved accuracy below an eGFR of 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 improved the value of POCT for those who most require a rapid diagnosis.

POCT may, however, be associated with potential harms, including overdiagnosis and underdiagnosis related to the accuracy concerns. These may differ between devices. The tendency of POCT for creatinine to 'overdiagnose' CKD stage may be beneficial from a clinical perspective in terms of fewer missed cases, however overdiagnosis may cause unnecessary anxiety in some patients. It is important that clinical guidelines and/or referral pathways are in place to ensure appropriate follow-up and management.

Clinical application

When considering the most appropriate diagnostic threshold for a test in practice, one must consider the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity that relates to threshold. What is acceptable in clinical practice will be determined by the place of the test in the management pathway (such as add-on, triage, or replacement) and the nature of the disease. When considering pre-eclampsia, one would wish a replacement test (stand alone) to limit the number of false negative results, as these women run the risk of developing undetected pre-eclampsia with a risk of serious morbidity and mortality. Women with false positive results will be subjected to increased monitoring and possibly pre-term delivery. Thus, protein to creatinine ratio as a replacement test would ideally use a threshold that maximises sensitivity and specificity. If protein to creatinine ratio were to be used as a triage test, with patients who test positive going on to have a 24 hour urine collection to verify the significant proteinuria, then false negatives need to be minimised but false positives will be identified by the second test, so sensitivity can be maximised at the expense of specificity. Our results can be used to determine the most appropriate threshold for each of these situations.

The findings from the multivariate meta-analysis relate to the accuracy of protein to creatinine ratio at the summary level (that is, averaged across all studies). Considerable heterogeneity exists at any threshold for which two or more studies provide evidence, so the performance of protein to creatinine ratio in an individual study setting may be somewhat different from the summary results presented here. Further research needs to identify the causes of heterogeneity in test accuracy across studies (for example, method of measurement, inaccurate reference standards) and identify those circumstances in which protein to creatinine ratio performs consistently well.

Prevalence of proteinuria also varied considerably across studies and has a big effect on how a protein to creatinine ratio test could be used. Following the protein to creatinine test, high positive and negative predictive values above 0.85 are achieved when the prevalence is high (for example, 0.8; see appendix E). However, when the prevalence is low (for example, 0.2; see appendix C), the negative predictive value remains above 0.85 but positive predictive value is then around 0.4. Thus a negative protein to creatinine ratio remains a good test for ruling out significant proteinuria, but positive tests results may have a high rate of false positives in this low prevalence population. Clinicians thus need to know the prevalence of significant proteinuria in the population and setting under investigation to allow accurate interpretation of the test results

Quality of studies

Figure 2shows a summary of the quality assessment of the included studies. We found good compliance with appropriate population spectrum, selection criteria adequately described, appropriate reference standard, and adequate description of index and reference standard. Blinding of the assessors of the outcome measure to the results of the albumin to creatinine ratio or protein to creatinine ratio was poorly reported (3/20 studies). No studies reported on the use of any treatment in between the albumin to creatinine ratio or protein to creatinine ratio and delivery or whether the results of the tests were used in determining patients' management. Verification bias was minimised, as the number of eligible women progressing to the reference standard in included studies was more than 90% in 18/20. Five out of the 20 included studies used less than 80% of included women in the final analysis; reasons for this included exclusion after trial entry, lack of verification with reference standard, and loss to follow-up. In 379 (13%) cases this was due to incomplete 24 hour urine collection.

### UK kidney association clinical practice guideline: sodium-glucose Co-transporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibition in adults with kidney disease 2023 UPDATE [^111NosL1]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Many factors can cause transient increases in albuminuria (including urinary tract infection, exercise, and menstruation) and as such, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) and other international guideline groups recommend that repeat testing should take place within 3 months if a single uACR result is between 3–69 mg/mmol. An early morning sample offers some advantages due to reduced impact of hydration status and exercise, but if unavailable, random sampling may still offer a reliable indication of total daily albuminuria. A uACR value ≥ 70 mg/mmol generally does not require further confirmation, as this is consistent with clinically significant proteinuria.

We agree with the statement within the NICE CKD guidelines that reagent strips and protein-to-creatinine ratio measurements should not be used to quantify albuminuria. Large-scale meta-analysis and other observational data have shown that dipstick values using reagent strips are neither sensitive, nor specific enough to predict uACR accurately. However, we recognise that uACR testing may not be regularly undertaken in some areas of the UK, and local methods of assessing risk may need to be used to ensure those at risk are offered SGLT-2 inhibition.
4 We recommend that SGLT-2 inhibition can be continued until the need for dialysis or kidney transplantation arises (Grade 1A).

Rationale

Data from CKD trials include many hundreds of participants with an eGFR below 20 mL/min/1.73m 2. Continued use of SGLT-2 inhibitors until the need for dialysis or kidney transplantation was the practice in these trials, which have confirmed benefits exceed any harms. In subgroup analyses, kidney benefits are unmodified by baseline eGFR. At a population level, people with a low eGFR are at highest absolute risk of kidney failure, and are therefore most likely to benefit (in absolute terms).
5 We suggest that co-prescription of SGLT-2 inhibition with MRA can be considered, where each are individually indicated (Grade 2B).

Guideline 4.1.3

We recommend quantification of proteinuria is undertaken by protein:creatinine ratio (uPCR) or albumin:creatinine ratio (uACR). Twenty-four hour urine collection for quantification of protein is not required (1B).

Rationale

Dipstick testing of urine with reagent strips to detect proteinuria preferentially detects albumin. False positives occur with dehydration, exercise, infection and alkaline urine. False negatives occur with dilute urine, and non-albumin proteinuria. A systematic review of seven prospective studies showed that the sensitivity and specificity of a dipstick result of ≥ 1+ protein for predicting abnormal proteinuria in pregnancy (> 300 mg/24 h) ranges from 47 to 86% and 39–95% respectively, leading to the conclusion that the accuracy of dipstick urinalysis with a 1+ threshold in the prediction of significant proteinuria is poor. However, automated dipstick urinalysis provides a more accurate screening test for the detection of proteinuria than visual testing in hypertensive pregnancies.

### Lupus nephritis: clinical presentations and outcomes in the 21st century [^112aB68x]. Rheumatology (2020). Medium credibility.

The role of kidney biopsy

The definition of renal involvement in SLE gained particular importance in the most recent sets of SLE classification criteria, where histology, together with a consistent SLE serology, is sufficient for disease classification. Nevertheless, the role of kidney biopsy has been questioned as most forms of LN can adequately be treated with glucocorticoids (GC) plus mycophenolate (MMF). However, because of the lack of univocal correlation between clinical presentation and histological abnormalities, renal biopsy remains fundamental in the evaluation and management of LN. It allows differentiation into pathological classes, the definition of the severity of renal involvement in terms of active and chronic lesions and the identification of other rare non-LN conditions such as anti-phospholipid antibody-associated nephropathy, IgA nephropathy, thrombotic microangiopathies, drug-induced tubulo-interstitial nephritis, diabetes nephropathy or hypertensive nephroangiosclerosis. A comprehensive assessment of renal biopsy may therefore guide clinicians in the choice of the more appropriate therapeutic strategy. A threshold of proteinuria to perform a renal biopsy has not yet been defined, but when it stably reaches or overcomes the level of 500 mg/24 h or spot urine protein to creatinine ratio (UPCR) > 500 mg/g (50 mg/mmol), especially with impaired renal function or active urinary sediment, it is reasonable to perform invasive investigations. Biopsy can also be considered in the presence of persistent haematuria or pyuria after exclusion of other potential causes or in case of unexplained renal insufficiency with normal urinalysis.

An adequate biopsy sample should include at least 10 glomeruli and the analysis be performed by light microscopy (LM), immunofluorescence (IF) and electron microscopy (EM) when available.

With the exception of cases with severe activity and chronicity indexes, the prognostic value of the basal kidney biopsy on long-term outcome is quite modest, while a second biopsy could be more informative. Nevertheless, no standardized protocols have been defined so far and re-biopsy is not part of routine care. According to international recommendations, a second biopsy can be considered in the presence of renal flare, unresponsiveness to treatment, worsening of renal function, persistent proteinuria or haematuria or to exclude an alternative diagnosis. Recent small LN studies suggest it may be highly informative also in patients in complete clinical renal response to stratify the risk of relapse and to guide immunosuppression withdrawal. Despite a clinical response to treatment, some patients still maintain mild histological signs of activity on repeated kidney biopsy which can lead to irreversible nephron loss.

### Proteinuria during pregnancy: definition, pathophysiology, methodology, and clinical significance [^116a6eU2]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). Medium credibility.

Qualitative and quantitative measurement of urine protein excretion is one of the most common tests performed during pregnancy. For more than 100 years, proteinuria was necessary for the diagnosis of preeclampsia, but recent guidelines recommend that proteinuria is sufficient but not necessary for the diagnosis. Still, in clinical practice, most patients with gestational hypertension will be diagnosed as having preeclampsia based on the presence of proteinuria. Although the reference standard for measuring urinary protein excretion is a 24-hour urine collection, spot urine protein-to-creatinine ratio is a reasonable "rule-out" test for proteinuria. Urine dipstick screening for proteinuria does not provide any clinical benefit and should not be used to diagnose proteinuria. The classic cutoff cited to define proteinuria during pregnancy is a value of > 300 mg/24 hours or a urine protein-to-creatinine ratio of at least 0.3. Using this cutoff, the rate of isolated proteinuria in pregnancy may reach 8%, whereas preeclampsia occurs among 3% to 8% of pregnancies. Although this threshold is widely accepted, its origin is not based on evidence on adverse pregnancy outcomes but rather on expert opinion and results of small studies. After reviewing the available data, the most important factor that influences maternal and neonatal outcome is the severity of blood pressures and presence of end organ damage, rather than the excess protein excretion. Because the management of gestational hypertension and preeclampsia without severe features is almost identical in frequency of surveillance and timing of delivery, the separation into 2 disorders is unnecessary. If the management of women with gestational hypertension with a positive assessment of proteinuria will not change, we believe that urine assessment for proteinuria is unnecessary in women who develop new-onset blood pressure at or after 20 weeks' gestation. Furthermore, we do not recommend repeated measurement of proteinuria for women with preeclampsia, the amount of proteinuria does not seem to be related to poor maternal and neonatal outcomes, and monitoring proteinuria may lead to unindicated preterm deliveries and related neonatal complications. Our current diagnosis of preeclampsia in women with chronic kidney disease may be based on a change in protein excretion, a baseline protein excretion evaluation is critical in certain conditions such as chronic hypertension, diabetes, and autoimmune or other renal disorders. The current definition of superimposed preeclampsia possesses a diagnostic dilemma, and it is unclear whether a change in the baseline proteinuria reflects another systemic disease such as preeclampsia or whether women with chronic disease such as chronic hypertension or diabetes will experience a different "normal" pattern of protein excretion during pregnancy. Finally, limited data are available regarding angiogenic and other biomarkers in women with chronic kidney disease as a potential aid in distinguishing the worsening of baseline chronic kidney disease and chronic hypertension from superimposed preeclampsia.

### Clinical practice guideline on pregnancy and renal disease [^115o3T3L]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Making the diagnosis of superimposed pre-eclampsia is complex in women with chronic kidney disease, particularly in the presence of pre-existing proteinuria and/or hypertension as these two signs are part of the diagnostic criteria for pre-eclampsia. Appearance of a new feature and/or the development of maternal organ dysfunction (Table 2) should lead to a diagnosis of preeclampsia being considered. Proteinuria is usually a feature of pre-eclampsia; however it is not required for diagnosis where there is other maternal organ dysfunction. Although it is recognized that gestational rises in blood pressure or protein excretion may occur, sudden and substantial change in these parameters in a woman with CKD should prompt her clinicians to evaluate her for a diagnosis of superimposed pre-eclampsia.

Table 2
Maternal organ dysfunction in pre-eclampsia. Adapted from

National guidelines recommend the use of placental growth factor-based testing (e.g. Triage placental growth factor (PlGF) test or the Elecsys immunoassay soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 1 (sFlt-1)/PlGF ratio), alongside standard clinical assessment and subsequent clinical follow-up, to help rule-out pre-eclampsia in women presenting with suspected pre-eclampsia between 20 weeks and 34 weeks plus 6 days of gestation. These tests have high sensitivity and negative predictive value for the diagnosis of pre-eclampsia and the need for delivery within 14 days in general obstetric cohorts; use of revealed PlGF testing halves the time to diagnosis of pre-eclampsia and reduces severe maternal adverse outcomes. PlGF-based testing has been reported to have similar diagnostic utility in small cohorts of women with CKD.

### Methods for diagnosing proteinuria-when to use which test and why: a review [^116ecPJu]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Proteinuria plays a central role in the diagnosis of kidney disease and has a high prognostic value. The test methods used differ considerably regarding their impact on test accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. Therefore, knowledge of the methodology is crucial for the interpretation of the results. In addition to the distinction between semiquantitative and quantitative tests, there are also relevant differences within the 2 methods. In general, semiquantitative tests are easy to handle but have limitations such as incomplete quantification, a lack of specificity regarding the type of proteinuria, and a high rate of false-positive results that require retesting with a quantitative method for verification. In contrast, quantitative methods, especially immunoassays, have the advantages of high test accuracy and the possibility of targeted detection of specific protein molecules in addition to albumin. However, these methods are more expensive and require access to a laboratory or an electronic point-of-care device. In this Review, the different types of tests for proteinuria and their underlying methodologies and strengths and weaknesses are discussed in detail to allow a rational decision of use and the correct interpretation of the results depending on the clinical context.

### Clinical practice guidelines for chronic kidney disease in adults: part II. glomerular filtration rate, proteinuria, and other markers [^115uJsQ9]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

The Kidney Disease Outcome Quality Initiative of the National Kidney Foundation published clinical practice guidelines on chronic kidney disease in February 2002. Of the 15 guidelines, the first six are of greatest relevance to family physicians. Part II of this two-part review covers guidelines 4, 5, and 6. Glomerular filtration rate is the best overall indicator of kidney function. It is superior to the serum creatinine level, which varies with age, sex, and race and often does not reflect kidney function accurately. The glomerular filtration rate can be estimated using prediction equations that take into account the serum creatinine level and some or all of specific variables (age, sex, race, body size). In many patients, estimates of the glomerular filtration rate can replace 24-hour urine collections for creatinine clearance measurements. Urine dipsticks generally are acceptable for detecting proteinuria. To quantify proteinuria, the ratio of protein or albumin to creatinine in an untimed (spot) urine sample is an accurate alternative to measurement of protein excretion in a 24-hour urine collection. Patients with persistent proteinuria have chronic kidney disease. Other techniques for evaluating patients with chronic kidney disease include examination of urinary sediment, urine dipstick testing for red and white blood cells, and imaging studies of the kidneys (especially ultrasonography). These techniques also can help determine the underlying cause of chronic kidney disease. Family physicians should weigh the value of the National Kidney Foundation guidelines for their clinical practice based on the strength of evidence and perceived cost-effectiveness until additional evidence becomes available on the usefulness of the recommended quality indicators.

Assessment of study quality

At least one reviewer used validated tools to assessed all included manuscripts for study and reporting quality. We defined methodological quality as the confidence that the study design, conduct, and analysis minimised biases in answering the research question, focusing on the internal validity (that is, the degree to which the results of an observation are correct for the patients being studied). Items considered important for a good quality paper were prospective design with consecutive/random recruitment or cross sectional studies, full verification of the test result with an outcome measure (> 90%), adequate description of the population and index test, and whether the clinicians managing the patients were blinded to the results of the index test. Consecutive recruitment is important to minimise bias and give a better reflection of the population. Prospective recruitment is important to ensure adequate and accurate collection of baseline variables and more complete follow-up. For the diagnosis of significant proteinuria, we also considered cross sectional studies to be of high quality as no time element is present.

We used QUADAS to assess the quality of the papers. We used the STARD checklist to assess elements of study design that were likely to have a direct relation to bias in a study of test accuracy.

Data synthesis

From the two by two tables, we calculated the following parameters for the different indices and various thresholds with their 95% confidence intervals for individual studies: sensitivity (true per cent positive), specificity (true per cent negative), and likelihood ratios (the ratio of the probability of the specific test result in people who have the disease to the probability in people who do not). Likelihood ratios indicate by how much a given test result raises or lowers the probability of the patient having the disease and have been recommended by evidence based medicine groups. Where two by two tables contained zero cells, we added 0.5 to each cell to enable calculations. We pooled results among groups of studies with the same threshold for protein to creatinine ratio or albumin to creatinine ratio (where necessary, we recalculated thresholds to mg/mg to ensure consistency of units) and the same outcome measure (either significant proteinuria (significant > 300 mg/24 hours, severe > 5000 mg/24 hours) on 24 hour collection or adverse pregnancy outcomes).

Relapse of LN — retreatment and reevaluation: We suggest that a relapse of LN after complete or partial remission be treated with the initial therapy followed by the maintenance therapy that was effective in inducing the original remission (2B), and if resuming the original therapy would put the patient at risk for excessive lifetime cyclophosphamide exposure, then we suggest a non–cyclophosphamide-based initial regimen be used (2B). Consider a repeat kidney biopsy during relapse if there is suspicion that the histologic class of LN has changed, or there is uncertainty whether a rising SCr and/or worsening proteinuria represents disease activity or chronicity (Not Graded). The commentary notes that many clinicians think that the upper limit of lifetime exposure should be 12 g/m2 intravenous cyclophosphamide, allowing for 2 full courses dosed at maximum of 1 g/m2, and it adds that a clinically defined relapse should consider increasing (ie, a doubling) proteinuria or a newly active urine sediment, with or without changes in serum creatinine.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for chronic kidney disease, more specifically with respect to initial evaluation, choice of test, KDIGO 2024 guidelines recommend to repeat tests to confirm the presence of CKD in case of incidental detection of elevated urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio, hematuria, or low eGFR.

### Population-based screening for CKD [^113ZdbBS]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Organizations both in the United States and globally have advocated for screening for chronic kidney disease with a urine test for proteinuria followed by subsequent testing with creatinine-based estimated glomerular filtration rate determinations. Screening for a disease, such as chronic kidney disease, can have value, but a decision to screen is not a trivial decision. Criteria must be met to balance the aggregate benefits with the risks and costs of a screening test. We discuss how screening for chronic kidney disease meets many of these criteria, but also how the populations to which it is applied must be targeted and the strategies for testing must be clearly defined.

### Proteinuria in children: evaluation and differential diagnosis [^1117Ns7Y]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Although proteinuria is usually benign in the form of transient or orthostatic proteinuria, persistent proteinuria may be associated with more serious renal diseases. Proteinuria may be an independent risk factor for the progression of chronic kidney disease in children. Mechanisms of proteinuria can be categorized as glomerular, tubular, secretory, or overflow. A history, a physical examination, and laboratory tests help determine the cause. Transient (functional) proteinuria is temporary. It can occur with fever, exercise, stress, or cold exposure, and it resolves when the inciting factor is removed. Orthostatic proteinuria is the most common type in children, especially in adolescent males. It is a benign condition without clinical significance. Persistent proteinuria can be glomerular or tubulointerstitial in origin. The urine dipstick test is the most widely used screening method. Although a 24-hour urine protein excretion test is usually recommended for quantitation of the amount of protein excreted in the urine, it may be impractical in children. A spot, first-morning urine test for a protein-to-creatinine or protein-to-osmolality ratio is a reliable substitute. Treatment of proteinuria should be directed at the underlying cause. Patients with active urinary sediments, hematuria, hypertension, hypocomplementemia, renal insufficiency with depressed glomerular filtration rate, or signs and symptoms suggestive of vasculitic disease may require referral to a pediatric nephrologist and a renal biopsy.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Preeclampsia — diagnostic criteria require hypertension plus proteinuria or, if proteinuria is absent, specific new-onset end-organ findings. Blood pressure criteria are: SBP ≥ 140 mm Hg or DBP ≥ 90 mm Hg on 2 occasions at least 4 h apart after ≥ 20 wk of gestation in a woman with previously normal BP, or SBP ≥ 160 mm Hg or DBP ≥ 110 mm Hg. Proteinuria is defined as ≥ 300 mg per 24 h urine collection, protein/creatinine ratio ≥ 0.3, or dipstick 2+. In the absence of proteinuria, new-onset hypertension with any of the following qualifies: platelet count < 100 x 10^9/L, serum creatinine concentrations > 1.1 mg/dL or doubling of creatinine without other renal disease, elevated liver transaminases to twice normal, pulmonary edema, or new-onset headache unresponsive to medication and not explained by other diagnoses or visual symptoms.

### Proteinuria as a surrogate marker for renal outcome: are we there yet? [^1178FdnC]. Kidney International (2015). Low credibility.

Observational studies in glomerular diseases suggest that proteinuria reduction translates to improved outcomes. Because of a dearth of high-quality studies supporting this association, proteinuria is not universally recognized as a surrogate end point. Barbour et al. report on the longitudinal measure of proteinuria that best predicts hard renal outcomes. Their finding that time-varying proteinuria is the most reliable proteinuria metric is a necessary step in establishing proteinuria as a surrogate end point.

### Current status and future perspectives for CKD testing [^112m3BQQ]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is common in the United States. CKD usually is silent until its late stages; thus, many patients with CKD are not aware of their kidney disease. Often, they are found to have CKD only shortly before the onset of symptomatic kidney failure, when there are few opportunities to prevent adverse outcomes. Earlier detection allows more time for evaluation and treatment, but requires explicit testing strategies for asymptomatic individuals at increased risk. CKD is defined as kidney damage or glomerular filtration rate (GFR) less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) for 3 months or longer. In the majority of patients, CKD can be detected by using 2 simple tests: a urine test for the detection of proteinuria and a blood test to estimate GFR. Understanding the strengths and limitations of CKD testing is critical for appropriate interpretation of the results. The major strength of CKD testing is its feasibility of implementation in public health activities and clinical practice, enabling the detection of CKD by using objective measures without knowledge of the cause of the kidney disease. The major limitation of testing for urine protein is that both total protein and albumin excretion can be increased transiently for a number of factors. The major limitation of current GFR-estimating equations is the inaccuracy of estimates at 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) and greater, which is the threshold for the definition of CKD. Repeated testing for urine protein and interpretation of GFR estimates in the context of kidney damage and the clinical context of patient presentation can help overcome these limitations.

### Diagnostic accuracy of spot urinary protein and albumin to creatinine ratios for detection of significant proteinuria or adverse pregnancy outcome in patients with suspected pre-eclampsia: systematic review and meta-analysis [^112rnTBQ]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions

The available evidence suggests that the protein to creatinine ratio has promising diagnostic value for significant proteinuria in suspected pre-eclampsia. The existing evidence is not, however, sufficient to determine how protein to creatinine ratio should be used in clinical practice, as it compares protein to creatinine ratio only with the presumed gold standard of 24 hour urine collection, and large heterogeneity exists in diagnostic accuracy across studies, even at the same threshold. Before its widespread implementation, the most appropriate setting, the prevalence of proteinuria in that setting, the most appropriate cut-off value to limit maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality, and the further testing and interventions that should follow a positive or negative test result need to be determined, and evidence for its cost effectiveness is needed. This evidence can be obtained only by prospectively designed studies of test accuracy with adequate sample size and attention to limiting bias and using appropriate outcome measures and cost effectiveness analysis using a decision tree model. This will allow the trade-off between positive and negative benefits to be truly evaluated.

### Quantifying the benefits of remission duration in focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis [^114NuPVo]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2023). Medium credibility.

Differentiating primary or immune-mediated from secondary disease is difficult due to the lack of a gold standard. While our selection criteria improve the likelihood that the included cases were immune-mediated variants of FSGS, these features cannot completely rule out non-immune-mediated factors. Using more rigid inclusion criteria, such as an albumin threshold, to increase diagnosis specificity would potentially come at the cost of excluding some primary FSGS with milder presentation. We feel additional support for an immune-mediated mechanism was that all 203 patients in our remission cohort had a significant reduction in proteinuria, and subsequent relapses were accompanied by a comparable increase in proteinuria as in the first nephrotic episode. All subsequent proteinuria remission also had similar reductions as the first one, making dominant secondary causes less likely. Nevertheless, because we lack a diagnostic gold standard for cases of primary FSGS, clinicians should be wary of using immunosuppression in milder cases, where no evidence of benefits has been reported and where unknown secondary causes may still exist. However, if, with careful monitoring, significant worsening of the clinical or laboratory features ensues, such treatments should be considered.

In summary, in FSGS patients, unless remissions are maintained and relapses avoided, long-term renal survival remains poor. Current guidelines emphasize the importance of obtaining a remission in proteinuria, but our data suggest that unless it is maintained and relapses avoided, long-term renal survival will remain unfavourable. This part of patient management remains poorly defined and should be part of all future treatment trials.

Risk assessment in people with CKD — overview on monitoring for progression of CKD based upon GFR and ACR categories states the following practice points: Assess albuminuria in adults, or albuminuria/proteinuria in children, and GFR at least annually in people with CKD. Assess albuminuria and GFR more often for individuals at higher risk of CKD progression when measurement will impact therapeutic decisions. For people with CKD, a change in eGFR of > 20% on a subsequent test exceeds the expected variability and warrants evaluation. Among people with CKD who initiate hemodynamically active therapies, GFR reductions of > 30% on subsequent testing exceed the expected variability and warrant evaluation. For albuminuria monitoring of people with CKD, a doubling of the ACR on a subsequent test exceeds laboratory variability and warrants evaluation.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV)–infected kidney transplant recipients — monitoring and biopsy thresholds are specified as follows. Untreated HCV-positive kidney transplant recipients should have the same liver disease follow-up as HCV-positive non-transplant patients, as outlined in the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) guidelines (Not Graded). HCV-infected kidney transplant recipients should be tested at least every 6 months for proteinuria (Not Graded). We suggest that patients who develop new-onset proteinuria (either urine protein-to-creatinine ratio > 1 g/g or 24-hour urine protein > 1 g on 2 or more occasions) have an allograft biopsy with immunofluorescence and electron microscopy included in the analysis (2D). We recommend treatment with a DAA regimen in patients with post-transplant HCV-associated glomerulonephritis (1D).

### Measuring albuminuria or proteinuria: does one answer fit all? [^113bgsG9]. Kidney International (2023). Medium credibility.

Measurement of proteinuria is critical for diagnosing and monitoring kidney disease. A variety of measures are available to clinicians and can identify all urinary proteins (proteinuria) or urine albumin alone (albuminuria). Proteinuria and albuminuria can be measured in either a random urine sample or a timed urine collection (often over 24 hours). Although an international guideline advocates the use of the urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio for most purposes, this measure is not universally available worldwide and historically has been more costly than alternatives. In addition, there may be important differences in accuracy between the albumin-to-creatinine ratio and others based on magnitude of albuminuria, sex, and certain clinical contexts. In this mini review, we review recommendations from international guidelines and discuss specific contexts where the optimal measure of proteinuria is unclear and, in some situations, controversial. We discuss the evidence supporting current recommendations for choice of measure, including the clinical settings of glomerulonephritis, transplantation, and pregnancy. We also discuss how patient sex and cost may impact this decision.
