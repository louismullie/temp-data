## Question

what is endometriosis and how is it diagnosed?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what endometriosis is and how it is diagnosed. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining endometriosis and its pathophysiology. Then, I should verify the clinical presentation and why diagnosis is often delayed. Next, I will examine the evolving diagnostic paradigm, including the role of clinical diagnosis versus surgical confirmation. After that, I need to review noninvasive tools: imaging and biomarkers, and their strengths and limitations. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stepwise diagnostic approach and highlight special populations and future directions, making sure I anchor each point to guidelines and high-quality evidence.

> Let me first confirm the definition and pathophysiology. Endometriosis is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by endometrium-like tissue outside the uterus, most often in the pelvis, with an associated inflammatory process; it affects roughly 5–10% of reproductive-age women and is associated with pelvic pain and infertility, imposing substantial quality-of-life and economic burdens [^117Lm7UR]. Hold on, I should verify the mechanism: retrograde menstruation is a leading theory, but genetic susceptibility, altered immunity, and hormonal milieu contribute, which helps explain heterogeneity and informs the search for biomarkers and targeted therapies [^117Lm7UR] [^116Zy3CJ].

> Next, I should review the clinical presentation and the diagnostic delay problem. Typical symptoms include dysmenorrhea, chronic pelvic pain, deep dyspareunia, dyschezia, dysuria, and infertility; adolescents may present with acyclic pain and minimal findings on exam, yet delays of 4–11 years are common due to symptom normalization, stigma, and clinician factors such as limited training and reliance on nondiscriminatory tests [^113y1aRp] [^116YPMyK] [^116Gmax2]. Wait, let me verify the magnitude of delay: multiple sources consistently cite 6–12 years, reinforcing the need for a noninvasive-first approach when appropriate [^116YPMyK].

> I will now examine the diagnostic paradigm shift. Historically, laparoscopy with histology was the gold standard; however, contemporary guidelines and reviews endorse a clinical diagnosis grounded in symptoms, exam, and imaging, reserving surgery for treatment or when noninvasive evaluation is negative yet suspicion remains high, reflecting a move away from diagnostic laparoscopy in routine care [^113fTVX7] [^111XeyKb] [^114UfQA6]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: surgical visualization remains valuable when imaging is negative and symptoms persist, or when definitive treatment is planned, but it should not be the default first step [^111XeyKb] [^114UfQA6].

> Let me consider the role of history and physical examination. I should confirm that guidelines emphasize a patient-centered approach, eliciting a complete history and performing a targeted exam, including vaginal and rectovaginal palpation to identify deep nodules or endometriomas, while acknowledging that exam sensitivity is limited, especially in early disease [^114de46y] [^1146ibXg] [^111vMneE]. But wait, what if the exam is normal? That does not exclude endometriosis, so clinical suspicion should still prompt imaging and, if indicated, empiric therapy rather than immediate surgery [^117CEkk2] [^114UfQA6].

> Next, I should review imaging, starting with ultrasound. Transvaginal ultrasound is first-line to detect ovarian endometriomas and map deep infiltrating endometriosis; specialist-performed, protocolized ultrasound improves sensitivity and specificity, and negative ultrasound does not rule out superficial peritoneal disease, which remains a key limitation [^114UfQA6] [^1172Y659] [^117CEkk2]. I need to check comparative performance: expert TVUS performs well for endometrioma and deep disease but has moderate sensitivity for deep lesions, whereas routine protocols underperform, underscoring the need for trained operators and standardized techniques [^113qsDGE] [^116yNWDM].

> Now, MRI. I should confirm that MRI is recommended when ultrasound is inconclusive or when deep disease is suspected, for preoperative mapping, or for postoperative recurrence, with modern high-resolution 3D sequences and compartment-based reporting improving accuracy and communication with surgeons [^111Zdafi] [^113yzihh] [^113Rf89L]. Hold on, I should verify relative strengths: MRI better depicts pelvic sidewall and extraperitoneal disease, while TVUS may outperform MRI for bowel wall invasion depth; thus, modality choice should reflect local expertise and clinical question [^116yNWDM] [^113yzihh].

> I will now examine biomarkers. Serum CA-125 has limited sensitivity and specificity and is not recommended for routine diagnosis; endometrial and urinary biomarkers remain investigational, with some combinations showing promise in small studies but lacking validation for clinical practice, so they should not be used outside research settings [^116dKG5d] [^111FrFcv] [^114xpFnU]. Wait, let me double-check: although PGP9.5 and certain combinations have shown high diagnostic estimates, heterogeneity and low-quality evidence preclude adoption, reinforcing that biomarkers are not yet ready for prime time [^116dKG5d] [^112FryQL].

> Let me synthesize a practical diagnostic approach. First, maintain a high index of suspicion in patients with dysmenorrhea, pelvic pain, deep dyspareunia, dyschezia, dysuria, or infertility, and take a thorough, patient-centered history and exam, documenting cyclicity and bowel or bladder involvement [^113y1aRp] [^114de46y]. Second, obtain TVUS as first-line imaging to assess for endometriomas and deep lesions; if negative or inconclusive but suspicion remains, proceed to specialist TVUS or MRI depending on availability and expertise [^114UfQA6] [^111Zdafi]. Third, consider empiric medical therapy for pain while acknowledging that response does not confirm the diagnosis, and reserve laparoscopy for refractory symptoms, negative imaging with persistent suspicion, or when definitive surgical treatment is indicated [^111XNbYN] [^111XeyKb]. I should confirm that this aligns with guideline-based care and balances accuracy with timeliness and safety [^114UfQA6] [^111XeyKb].

> But wait, what about special populations and contexts. In adolescents, I should consider TVUS when appropriate and use MRI or alternative sonographic approaches if TVUS is not feasible; many adolescents have early-stage disease with subtle or absent exam findings, so clinical diagnosis with early intervention is reasonable [^113SNNUU] [^115UeYbU]. In infertility, I need to ensure that imaging replaces routine diagnostic laparoscopy, with ART considerations individualized; modern practice favors noninvasive diagnosis and targeted surgery only when it will change management or outcomes [^115YhjuD] [^113fTVX7]. In postmenopause, I should remember that endometriosis can persist or arise de novo, so atypical pain or masses warrant MRI and careful exclusion of malignancy [^1161Asmf].

> Next, I should review emerging tools and future directions. Artificial intelligence applied to imaging and clinical data shows promising sensitivity and specificity in early studies, but external validation and integration into workflow are needed before routine use [^116YPMyK] [^114n2wxj]. Standardized MRI protocols, compartment-based reporting, and international consensus lexicons are advancing preoperative mapping and multidisciplinary care, which should reduce variability and improve outcomes [^113yzihh] [^114ixyjg]. Hold on, I should verify that these advances complement, rather than replace, clinical judgment and patient preferences in shared decision-making [^113fTVX7].

> Finally, I need to ensure the bottom line is clear. Endometriosis is best understood as a chronic, systemic, inflammatory disease with heterogeneous presentations; diagnosis should be grounded in symptoms and exam, with TVUS as first-line imaging and MRI as adjuncts, while biomarkers remain investigational; surgery is reserved for treatment or unresolved diagnostic uncertainty, and this approach reduces delay without sacrificing accuracy when applied thoughtfully and with appropriate expertise [^116Zy3CJ] [^114UfQA6] [^113fTVX7]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost implied that MRI can replace ultrasound outright; I should correct that: ultrasound remains first-line due to accessibility and performance for endometrioma and many deep lesions, with MRI as the problem-solving modality when ultrasound is limited or when detailed mapping is required [^114UfQA6] [^111Zdafi].

Endometriosis is a chronic, inflammatory disease defined by **endometrium-like tissue outside the uterus** [^116Zy3CJ], causing pelvic pain, infertility, and fatigue [^117Lm7UR]. Diagnosis is **clinical plus imaging** [^113fTVX7]: suspect in patients with dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, chronic pelvic pain, or infertility [^113y1aRp], then use transvaginal ultrasound to detect endometriomas or deep lesions [^114UfQA6]; add MRI if ultrasound is inconclusive or deep disease is suspected [^111Zdafi] [^117KFxMB]. Laparoscopy with histology is no longer routine [^113fTVX7] and is reserved for uncertain cases or when surgery is planned [^111XeyKb]. No single noninvasive test is definitive [^115RTd9k], so diagnosis integrates symptoms, exam, and imaging [^113fTVX7], with a negative scan not excluding disease [^117CEkk2].

---

## Definition and pathophysiology

Endometriosis is characterized by **endometrium-like tissue outside the uterus** [^116Zy3CJ], typically on pelvic peritoneum, ovaries, and bowel, and is driven by estrogen, inflammation, and immune dysfunction [^117Lm7UR]. It affects about 10% of reproductive-age women and is associated with pelvic pain, infertility, and fatigue [^116Zy3CJ].

---

## Clinical presentation

Symptoms are **highly variable** [^116Zy3CJ]; some patients are asymptomatic, while others have severe pain or infertility [^117Lm7UR]. Common features include:

- **Dysmenorrhea**: progressive, severe menstrual pain [^113y1aRp].
- **Chronic pelvic pain**: noncyclical pain [^113y1aRp].
- **Deep dyspareunia**: pain with intercourse [^113y1aRp].
- **Dyschezia/dysuria**: bowel/bladder pain, often cyclical [^113y1aRp].
- **Infertility**: present in 30–50% of cases [^notfound].
- **Fatigue**: common and often overlooked [^116Zy3CJ].

---

## Diagnostic approach

### Clinical diagnosis

Clinical diagnosis relies on **symptoms and examination** [^113fTVX7]. Suspect endometriosis in patients with dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, chronic pelvic pain, or infertility [^113y1aRp], and perform a pelvic exam to identify tender nodules, a fixed uterus, or adnexal masses [^116SJhqY]. However, a normal exam does not exclude disease [^117CEkk2].

---

### Imaging modalities

Imaging is central to **noninvasive diagnosis** [^113fTVX7]:

| **Modality** | **Indications** | **Accuracy** | **Limitations** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) | First-line for endometriomas and deep disease | High for endometriomas; moderate for deep disease | Operator-dependent; limited for superficial peritoneal disease [^113qsDGE] |
| Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) | - Inconclusive TVUS <br/> - Suspected deep disease <br/> - Preoperative mapping | High for deep infiltrating endometriosis | Costly; less available [^notfound] |
| Transrectal ultrasound | Suspected rectosigmoid disease | High specificity | Limited availability [^notfound] |

---

Laparoscopy with histology is reserved for **uncertain cases** or when surgery is planned [^111XeyKb]; it is no longer routine for diagnosis [^113fTVX7].

---

## Limitations and challenges

- **Diagnostic delay**: averages 6–11 years due to nonspecific symptoms and reliance on surgery [^116suc8J] [^112g2vW3].
- **Imaging limitations**: TVUS misses superficial disease; MRI is less available and operator-dependent [^117CEkk2] [^116yNWDM].
- **Biomarkers**: CA-125 and others lack accuracy for routine use [^116dKG5d] [^111FrFcv].

---

## Recent advances

- **Specialist ultrasound**: improved detection of deep disease [^113qsDGE].
- **AI**: emerging to enhance imaging accuracy [^116YPMyK].
- **Standardization**: MRI protocols and reporting are improving [^113yzihh].

---

## Summary of diagnostic algorithm

- **Step 1**: Clinical suspicion from symptoms and exam [^113y1aRp].
- **Step 2**: TVUS for endometriomas and deep lesions [^114UfQA6].
- **Step 3**: MRI if TVUS is inconclusive or deep disease is suspected [^111Zdafi].
- **Step 4**: Laparoscopy if diagnosis remains uncertain or surgery is planned [^111XeyKb].

---

Endometriosis is best diagnosed by integrating **clinical suspicion with imaging** [^113fTVX7]; TVUS and MRI are the main noninvasive tools, while laparoscopy is reserved for select cases [^111XeyKb]. This approach reduces delay and avoids unnecessary surgery [^113qsDGE].

### Imaging modalities for the non-invasive diagnosis of endometriosis [^115RTd9k]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

About 10% of women of reproductive age suffer from endometriosis. Endometriosis is a costly chronic disease that causes pelvic pain and subfertility. Laparoscopy, the gold standard diagnostic test for endometriosis, is expensive and carries surgical risks. Currently, no non-invasive tests that can be used to accurately diagnose endometriosis are available in clinical practice. This is the first review of diagnostic test accuracy of imaging tests for endometriosis that uses Cochrane methods to provide an update on the rapidly expanding literature in this field.

Objectives

- To provide estimates of the diagnostic accuracy of imaging modalities for the diagnosis of pelvic endometriosis, ovarian endometriosis and deeply infiltrating endometriosis (DIE) versus surgical diagnosis as a reference standard.• To describe performance of imaging tests for mapping of deep endometriotic lesions in the pelvis at specific anatomical sites. Imaging tests were evaluated as replacement tests for diagnostic surgery and as triage tests that would assist decision making regarding diagnostic surgery for endometriosis.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases to 20 April 2015: MEDLINE, CENTRAL, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Web of Science, LILACS, OAIster, TRIP, ClinicalTrials.gov, MEDION, DARE, and PubMed. Searches were not restricted to a particular study design or language nor to specific publication dates. The search strategy incorporated words in the title, abstracts, text words across the record and medical subject headings (MeSH).

Selection Criteria

We considered published peer-reviewed cross-sectional studies and randomised controlled trials of any size that included prospectively recruited women of reproductive age suspected of having one or more of the following target conditions: endometrioma, pelvic endometriosis, DIE or endometriotic lesions at specific intrapelvic anatomical locations. We included studies that compared the diagnostic test accuracy of one or more imaging modalities versus findings of surgical visualisation of endometriotic lesions.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently collected and performed a quality assessment of data from each study. For each imaging test, data were classified as positive or negative for surgical detection of endometriosis, and sensitivity and specificity estimates were calculated. If two or more tests were evaluated in the same cohort, each was considered as a separate data set. We used the bivariate model to obtain pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity when sufficient data sets were available. Predetermined criteria for a clinically useful imaging test to replace diagnostic surgery included sensitivity ≥ 94% and specificity ≥ 79%. Criteria for triage tests were set at sensitivity ≥ 95% and specificity ≥ 50%, ruling out the diagnosis with a negative result (SnNout test - if sensitivity is high, a negative test rules out pathology) or at sensitivity ≥ 50% with specificity ≥ 95%, ruling in the diagnosis with a positive result (SpPin test - if specificity is high, a positive test rules in pathology).

Main Results

We included 49 studies involving 4807 women: 13 studies evaluated pelvic endometriosis, 10 endometriomas and 15 DIE, and 33 studies addressed endometriosis at specific anatomical sites. Most studies were of poor methodological quality. The most studied modalities were transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), with outcome measures commonly demonstrating diversity in diagnostic estimates; however, sources of heterogeneity could not be reliably determined. No imaging test met the criteria for a replacement or triage test for detecting pelvic endometriosis, albeit TVUS approached the criteria for a SpPin triage test. For endometrioma, TVUS (eight studies, 765 participants; sensitivity 0.93 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.87, 0.99), specificity 0.96 (95% CI 0.92, 0.99)) qualified as a SpPin triage test and approached the criteria for a replacement and SnNout triage test, whereas MRI (three studies, 179 participants; sensitivity 0.95 (95% CI 0.90, 1.00), specificity 0.91 (95% CI 0.86, 0.97)) met the criteria for a replacement and SnNout triage test and approached the criteria for a SpPin test. For DIE, TVUS (nine studies, 12 data sets, 934 participants; sensitivity 0.79 (95% CI 0.69, 0.89) and specificity 0.94 (95% CI 0.88, 1.00)) approached the criteria for a SpPin triage test, and MRI (six studies, seven data sets, 266 participants; sensitivity 0.94 (95% CI 0.90, 0.97), specificity 0.77 (95% CI 0.44, 1.00)) approached the criteria for a replacement and SnNout triage test. Other imaging tests assessed in small individual studies could not be statistically evaluated.TVUS met the criteria for a SpPin triage test in mapping DIE to uterosacral ligaments, rectovaginal septum, vaginal wall, pouch of Douglas (POD) and rectosigmoid. MRI met the criteria for a SpPin triage test for POD and vaginal and rectosigmoid endometriosis. Transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS) might qualify as a SpPin triage test for rectosigmoid involvement but could not be adequately assessed for other anatomical sites because heterogeneous data were scant. Multi-detector computerised tomography enema (MDCT-e) displayed the highest diagnostic performance for rectosigmoid and other bowel endometriosis and met the criteria for both SpPin and SnNout triage tests, but studies were too few to provide meaningful results. Diagnostic accuracies were higher for TVUS with bowel preparation (TVUS-BP) and rectal water contrast (RWC-TVS) and for 3.0TMRI than for conventional methods, although the paucity of studies precluded statistical evaluation.

Authors' Conclusions

None of the evaluated imaging modalities were able to detect overall pelvic endometriosis with enough accuracy that they would be suggested to replace surgery. Specifically for endometrioma, TVUS qualified as a SpPin triage test. MRI displayed sufficient accuracy to suggest utility as a replacement test, but the data were too scant to permit meaningful conclusions. TVUS could be used clinically to identify additional anatomical sites of DIE compared with MRI, thus facilitating preoperative planning. Rectosigmoid endometriosis was the only site that could be accurately mapped by using TVUS, TRUS, MRI or MDCT-e. Studies evaluating recent advances in imaging modalities such as TVUS-BP, RWC-TVS, 3.0TMRI and MDCT-e were observed to have high diagnostic accuracies but were too few to allow prudent evaluation of their diagnostic role. In view of the low quality of most of the included studies, the findings of this review should be interpreted with caution. Future well-designed diagnostic studies undertaken to compare imaging tests for diagnostic test accuracy and costs are recommended.

### Advances in non-invasive diagnostic tools for endometriosis: a narrative review of the past ten years [^114WS7KX]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Endometriosis is a chronic condition defined by endometrium-like tissue outside the uterus, with symptoms including pain, infertility, and fatigue. Despite the high prevalence of disease, diagnosis is frequently delayed, in part due to reliance on invasive procedures such as laparoscopy. Over the past decade, scientific research and international collaborations have focused on the development of non-invasive diagnostic tools to allow earlier detection and reduce the burden of surgical diagnosis. This narrative review summarizes key developments in non-invasive tools over the past decade. These advances include those in the biomarker space, imaging techniques and protocols, and artificial intelligence applications. While no single test has yet replaced laparoscopy, significant strides have been made toward safer, earlier diagnosis. Continued interdisciplinary collaboration, standardization of imaging and research protocols, and large-scale validation studies are essential for translating these findings into clinical practice.

### Challenges to our understanding of endometriosis pain [^113uW2qU]. Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology (2006). Low credibility.

Endometriosis remains a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge despite decades of clinical experience and research. The multiple treatment options for endometriosis described in this symposium clearly indicate how difficult it can be to diagnose and effectively treat endometriosis with our current understanding of the disease. At least 3 major challenges to our understanding can be identified: (1) endometriosis does not always cause pain; (2) other causes of pelvic pain often coexists in patients with endometriosis; and (3) common medical and surgical treatments for endometriosis are relatively nonspecific. Insights from the articles in this symposium can help clinicians reach a new level of understanding of endometriosis and perhaps lead to more effective methods for diagnosing and treating this perplexing condition.

### Endometrial biomarkers for the non-invasive diagnosis of endometriosis [^116dKG5d]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

About 10% of reproductive-aged women suffer from endometriosis, which is a costly, chronic disease that causes pelvic pain and subfertility. Laparoscopy is the gold standard diagnostic test for endometriosis, but it is expensive and carries surgical risks. Currently, there are no non-invasive tests available in clinical practice that accurately diagnose endometriosis. This is the first diagnostic test accuracy review of endometrial biomarkers for endometriosis that utilises Cochrane methodologies, providing an update on the rapidly expanding literature in this field.

Objectives

To determine the diagnostic accuracy of the endometrial biomarkers for pelvic endometriosis, using a surgical diagnosis as the reference standard. We evaluated the tests as replacement tests for diagnostic surgery and as triage tests to inform decisions to undertake surgery for endometriosis.

Search Methods

We did not restrict the searches to particular study designs, language or publication dates. To identify trials, we searched the following databases: CENTRAL (2015, July), MEDLINE (inception to May 2015), EMBASE (inception to May 2015), CINAHL (inception to April 2015), PsycINFO (inception to April 2015), Web of Science (inception to April 2015), LILACS (inception to April 2015), OAIster (inception to April 2015), TRIP (inception to April 2015) and ClinicalTrials.gov (inception to April 2015). We searched DARE and PubMed databases up to April 2015 to identify reviews and guidelines as sources of references to potentially relevant studies. We also performed searches for papers recently published and not yet indexed in the major databases. The search strategies incorporated words in the title, abstract, text words across the record and the medical subject headings (MeSH).

Selection Criteria

We considered published peer-reviewed, randomised controlled or cross-sectional studies of any size that included prospectively collected samples from any population of reproductive-aged women suspected of having one or more of the following target conditions: ovarian, peritoneal or deep infiltrating endometriosis (DIE).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently extracted data from each study and performed a quality assessment. For each endometrial diagnostic test, we classified the data as positive or negative for the surgical detection of endometriosis and calculated the estimates of sensitivity and specificity. We considered two or more tests evaluated in the same cohort as separate data sets. We used the bivariate model to obtain pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity whenever sufficient data were available. The predetermined criteria for a clinically useful test to replace diagnostic surgery was one with a sensitivity of 94% and a specificity of 79%. The criteria for triage tests were set at sensitivity at or above 95% and specificity at or above 50%, which in case of negative results rules out the diagnosis (SnOUT test) or sensitivity at or above 50% with specificity at or above 95%, which in case of positive result rules in the diagnosis (SpIN test).

Main Results

We included 54 studies involving 2729 participants, most of which were of poor methodological quality. The studies evaluated endometrial biomarkers either in specific phases of the menstrual cycle or outside of it, and the studies tested the biomarkers either in menstrual fluid, in whole endometrial tissue or in separate endometrial components. Twenty-seven studies evaluated the diagnostic performance of 22 endometrial biomarkers for endometriosis. These were angiogenesis and growth factors (PROK-1), cell-adhesion molecules (integrins α3β1, α4β1, β1 and α6), DNA-repair molecules (hTERT), endometrial and mitochondrial proteome, hormonal markers (CYP19, 17βHSD2, ER-α, ER-β), inflammatory markers (IL-1R2), myogenic markers (caldesmon, CALD-1), neural markers (PGP 9.5, VIP, CGRP, SP, NPY, NF) and tumour markers (CA-125). Most of these biomarkers were assessed in single studies, whilst only data for PGP 9.5 and CYP19 were available for meta-analysis. These two biomarkers demonstrated significant diversity for the diagnostic estimates between the studies; however, the data were too limited to reliably determine the sources of heterogeneity. The mean sensitivities and specificities of PGP 9.5 (7 studies, 361 women) were 0.96 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.91 to 1.00) and 0.86 (95% CI 0.70 to 1.00), after excluding one outlier study, and for CYP19 (8 studies, 444 women), they were were 0.77 (95% CI 0.70 to 0.85) and 0.74 (95% CI 0.65 to 84), respectively. We could not statistically evaluate other biomarkers in a meaningful way. An additional 31 studies evaluated 77 biomarkers that showed no evidence of differences in expression levels between the groups of women with and without endometriosis.

Authors' Conclusions

We could not statistically evaluate most of the biomarkers assessed in this review in a meaningful way. In view of the low quality of most of the included studies, the findings of this review should be interpreted with caution. Although PGP 9.5 met the criteria for a replacement test, it demonstrated considerable inter study heterogeneity in diagnostic estimates, the source of which could not be determined. Several endometrial biomarkers, such as endometrial proteome, 17βHSD2, IL-1R2, caldesmon and other neural markers (VIP, CGRP, SP, NPY and combination of VIP, PGP 9.5 and SP) showed promising evidence of diagnostic accuracy, but there was insufficient or poor quality evidence for any clinical recommendations. Laparoscopy remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of endometriosis, and using any non-invasive tests should only be undertaken in a research setting. We have also identified a number of biomarkers that demonstrated no diagnostic value for endometriosis. We recommend that researchers direct future studies towards biomarkers with high diagnostic potential in good quality diagnostic studies.

### Pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management of endometriosis [^116Zy3CJ]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Endometriosis affects approximately 190 million women and people assigned female at birth worldwide. It is a chronic, inflammatory, gynecologic disease marked by the presence of endometrial-like tissue outside the uterus, which in many patients is associated with debilitating painful symptoms. Patients with endometriosis are also at greater risk of infertility, emergence of fatigue, multisite pain, and other comorbidities. Thus, endometriosis is best understood as a condition with variable presentation and effects at multiple life stages. A long diagnostic delay after symptom onset is common, and persistence and recurrence of symptoms despite treatment is common. This review discusses the potential genetic, hormonal, and immunologic factors that lead to endometriosis, with a focus on current diagnostic and management strategies for gynecologists, general practitioners, and clinicians specializing in conditions for which patients with endometriosis are at higher risk. It examines evidence supporting the different surgical, pharmacologic, and non-pharmacologic approaches to treating patients with endometriosis and presents an easy to adopt step-by-step management strategy. As endometriosis is a multisystem disease, patients with the condition should ideally be offered a personalized, multimodal, interdisciplinary treatment approach. A priority for future discovery is determining clinically informative sub-classifications of endometriosis that predict prognosis and enhance treatment prioritization.

### An evidence-based approach to assessing surgical versus clinical diagnosis of symptomatic endometriosis [^1125arYT]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2018). Low credibility.

Challenges intrinsic to the accurate diagnosis of endometriosis contribute to an extended delay between the onset of symptoms and clinical confirmation. Intraoperative visualization, preferably with histologic verification, is considered by many professional organizations to be the gold standard by which endometriosis is diagnosed. Clinical diagnosis of symptomatic endometriosis via patient history, physical examination, and noninvasive tests, though more easily executed, is generally viewed as less accurate than surgical diagnosis. Technological advances and increased understanding of the pathophysiology of endometriosis warrant continuing reevaluation of the standard method for diagnosing symptomatic disease. A review of the published literature was therefore performed with the goal of comparing the accuracy of clinical diagnostic measures with that of surgical diagnosis. The current body of evidence suggests that clinical diagnosis of symptomatic endometriosis is more reliable than previously recognized and that surgical diagnosis has limitations that could be underappreciated. Regardless of the methodology used, women with suspected symptomatic endometriosis would be well served by a diagnostic paradigm that is reliable, conveys minimal risk of under- or over-diagnosis, lessens the time from symptom development to diagnosis, and guides the appropriate use of medical and surgical management strategies.

### Nonsurgical approaches to the diagnosis and evaluation of endometriosis [^114Yytdm]. Fertility and Sterility (2024). Medium credibility.

An inability to make the diagnosis of endometriosis or evaluate lesion response to treatment without surgery is a clear impediment to understanding the disease and to developing new therapies. The need is particularly strong for rASRM Stage 1 or 2 disease, since higher stage (rASRM Stage 3 or 4) endometriosis can often be diagnosed by ultrasound or other imaging techniques. Despite promising findings in association studies, no biomarkers or nonsurgical diagnostic or evaluation methods for Stage 1 or Stage 2 endometriosis has yet been clinically validated. Admittedly, validation is difficult, since surgery is required as a gold standard diagnostic method for comparison. This manuscript is aimed as a succinct review of what is known about nonsurgical approaches to detect and assess endometriosis, with an emphasis on Stage 1 and 2.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® endometriosis [^114UG9Ed]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Endometriosis is a common condition impacting individuals assigned female at birth. Though incompletely understood, the disorder is caused by endometrial-like tissue located outside of the endometrial cavity, associated with inflammation and fibrosis. Clinical presentation is variable, ranging from asymptomatic to severe pelvic pain and infertility. Treatment is determined by the patient's individualized goals and can include medical therapies to temporize symptoms or definitive surgical excision. Imaging is used to help diagnose endometriosis and for treatment planning. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

### Combination of the non-invasive tests for the diagnosis of endometriosis [^112FryQL]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

About 10% of women of reproductive age suffer from endometriosis, a costly chronic disease causing pelvic pain and subfertility. Laparoscopy is the gold standard diagnostic test for endometriosis, but is expensive and carries surgical risks. Currently, there are no non-invasive tests available in clinical practice to accurately diagnose endometriosis. This review assessed the diagnostic accuracy of combinations of different non-invasive testing modalities for endometriosis and provided a summary of all the reviews in the non-invasive tests for endometriosis series.

Objectives

To estimate the diagnostic accuracy of any combination of non-invasive tests for the diagnosis of pelvic endometriosis (peritoneal and/or ovarian or deep infiltrating) compared to surgical diagnosis as a reference standard. The combined tests were evaluated as replacement tests for diagnostic surgery and triage tests to assist decision-making to undertake diagnostic surgery for endometriosis.

Search Methods

We did not restrict the searches to particular study designs, language or publication dates. We searched CENTRAL to July 2015, MEDLINE and EMBASE to May 2015, as well as the following databases to April 2015: CINAHL, PsycINFO, Web of Science, LILACS, OAIster, TRIP, ClinicalTrials.gov, DARE and PubMed.

Selection Criteria

We considered published, peer-reviewed, randomised controlled or cross-sectional studies of any size, including prospectively collected samples from any population of women of reproductive age suspected of having one or more of the following target conditions: ovarian, peritoneal or deep infiltrating endometriosis (DIE). We included studies comparing the diagnostic test accuracy of a combination of several testing modalities with the findings of surgical visualisation of endometriotic lesions.

Data Collection and Analysis

Three review authors independently collected and performed a quality assessment of the data from each study by using the QUADAS-2 tool. For each test, the data were classified as positive or negative for the surgical detection of endometriosis and sensitivity and specificity estimates were calculated. The bivariate model was planned to obtain pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity whenever sufficient data were available. The predetermined criteria for a clinically useful test to replace diagnostic surgery were a sensitivity of 0.94 and a specificity of 0.79 to detect endometriosis. We set the criteria for triage tests at a sensitivity of 0.95 and above and a specificity of 0.50 and above, which 'rules out' the diagnosis with high accuracy if there is a negative test result (SnOUT test), or a sensitivity of 0.50 and above and a specificity of 0.95 and above, which 'rules in' the diagnosis with high accuracy if there is a positive result (SpIN test).

Main Results

Eleven eligible studies included 1339 participants. All the studies were of poor methodological quality. Seven studies evaluated pelvic endometriosis, one study considered DIE and/or ovarian endometrioma, two studies differentiated endometrioma from other ovarian cysts and one study addressed mapping DIE at specific anatomical sites. Fifteen different diagnostic combinations were assessed, including blood, urinary or endometrial biomarkers, transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) and clinical history or examination. We did not pool estimates of sensitivity and specificity, as each study analysed independent combinations of the non-invasive tests. Tests that met the criteria for a replacement test were: a combination of serum IL-6 (cut-off > 15.4 pg/ml) and endometrial PGP 9.5 for pelvic endometriosis (sensitivity 1.00 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.91 to 1.00), specificity 0.93 (95% CI, 0.80, 0.98) and the combination of vaginal examination and transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) for rectal endometriosis (sensitivity 0.96 (95% CI 0.86 to 0.99), specificity 0.98 (95% CI 0.94 to 1.00)). Tests that met the criteria for SpIN triage tests for pelvic endometriosis were: 1. a multiplication of urine vitamin-D-binding protein (VDBP) and serum CA-125 (cut-off > 2755) (sensitivity 0.74 (95% CI 0.60 to 0.84), specificity 0.97 (95% CI 0.86 to 1.00)) and 2. a combination of history (length of menses), serum CA-125 (cut-off > 35 U/ml) and endometrial leukocytes (sensitivity 0.61 (95% CI 0.54 to 0.69), specificity 0.95 (95% CI 0.91 to 0.98)). For endometrioma, the following combinations qualified as SpIN test: 1. TVUS and either serum CA-125 (cut-off ≥ 25 U/ml) or CA 19.9 (cut-off ≥ 12 U/ml) (sensitivity 0.79 (95% CI 0.64 to 0.91), specificity 0.97 (95% CI 0.91 to 1.00)); 2. TVUS and serum CA 19.9 (cut-off ≥ 12 U/ml) (sensitivity 0.54 (95% CI 0.37 to 0.70), specificity 0.97 (95% CI 0.91 to 1.0)); 3–4. TVUS and serum CA-125 (cut-off ≥ 20 U/ml or cut-off ≥ 25 U/ml) (sensitivity 0.69 (95% CI 0.49 to 0.85), specificity 0.96 (95% CI 0.88 to 0.99)); 5. TVUS and serum CA-125 (cut-off ≥ 35 U/ml) (sensitivity 0.52 (95% CI 0.33 to 0.71), specificity 0.97 (95% CI 0.90 to 1.00)). A combination of vaginal examination and TVUS reached the threshold for a SpIN test for obliterated pouch of Douglas (sensitivity 0.87 (95% CI 0.69 to 0.96), specificity 0.98 (95% CI 0.95 to 1.00)), vaginal wall endometriosis (sensitivity 0.82 (95% CI 0.60 to 0.95), specificity 0.99 (95% CI 0.97 to 1.0)) and rectovaginal septum endometriosis (sensitivity 0.88 (95% CI 0.47 to 1.00), specificity 0.99 (95% CI 0.96 to 1.00)). All the tests were evaluated in individual studies and displayed wide CIs. Due to the heterogeneity and high risk of bias of the included studies, the clinical utility of the studied combination diagnostic tests for endometriosis remains unclear.

Authors' Conclusions

None of the biomarkers evaluated in this review could be evaluated in a meaningful way and there was insufficient or poor-quality evidence. Laparoscopy remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of endometriosis and using any non-invasive tests should only be undertaken in a research setting.

### Changing the "scope" of diagnosing endometriosis: the new frontier of noninvasive markers [^114xpFnU]. Fertility and Sterility (2024). Medium credibility.

Endometriosis affects 1 in 9 women, and diagnosis is often delayed using conventional laparoscopy. Noninvasive markers of endometriosis have the potential to enable earlier diagnosis, leading to more timely treatment and better surgical planning. This issue's Views and Reviews seek to summarize the current status of noninvasive markers of endometriosis. Experts in reproductive medicine with prior work in this field summarize the key literature on endometrial biomarkers, blood biomarkers, and advanced imaging, including ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging. At present, there is no single definitive biomarker that can diagnose endometriosis with high sensitivity and specificity. Advancing endometriosis biomarkers beyond the discovery phase is challenging, and more work is needed. Clinicians who have an improved understanding of noninvasive imaging and biomarkers will be able to identify endometriosis earlier and more easily, allowing for prompt consideration of treatment options. We believe that continued research, innovation, and development will lead to improved diagnostic accuracy and guidance toward the best treatments for endometriosis-related pain and infertility.

### Clinical diagnosis of endometriosis: a call to action [^116suc8J]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). Medium credibility.

Endometriosis can have a profound impact on women's lives, including associated pain, infertility, decreased quality of life, and interference with daily life, relationships, and livelihood. The first step in alleviating these adverse sequelae is to diagnose the underlying condition. For many women, the journey to endometriosis diagnosis is long and fraught with barriers and misdiagnoses. Inherent challenges include a gold standard based on an invasive surgical procedure (laparoscopy) and diverse symptomatology, contributing to the well-established delay of 4–11 years from first symptom onset to surgical diagnosis. We believe that remedying the diagnostic delay requires increased patient education and timely referral to a women's healthcare provider and a shift in physician approach to the disorder. Endometriosis should be approached as a chronic, systemic, inflammatory, and heterogeneous disease that presents with symptoms of pelvic pain and/or infertility, rather than focusing primarily on surgical findings and pelvic lesions. Using this approach, symptoms, signs, and clinical findings of endometriosis are anticipated to become the main drivers of clinical diagnosis and earlier intervention. Combining these factors into a practical algorithm is expected to simplify endometriosis diagnosis and make the process accessible to more clinicians and patients, culminating in earlier effective management. The time has come to bridge disparities and to minimize delays in endometriosis diagnosis and treatment for the benefit of women worldwide.

### Endometriosis classification, staging and reporting systems: a review on the road to a universally accepted endometriosis classification [^114dPKmw]. Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

In the field of endometriosis, several classification, staging and reporting systems have been developed. Which endometriosis classification, staging and reporting systems have been published and validated for use in clinical practice?

Data Sources

A systematic PUBMED literature search was performed. Data were extracted and summarized.

Methods Of Study Selection

na TABULATION, INTEGRATION AND RESULTS: Twenty-two endometriosis classification, staging and reporting systems have been published between 1973 and 2021, each developed for specific, and different, purposes. There still is no international agreement on how to describe the disease. Studies evaluating the different systems are summarized showing a discrepancy between the intended and the evaluated purpose, and a general lack of validation data confirming a correlation with pain symptoms or quality of life for any of the current systems. A few studies confirm the value of the ENZIAN system for surgical description of deep endometriosis. With regards to infertility, the endometriosis fertility index has been confirmed valid for its intended purpose.

Conclusion

Of the 22 endometriosis classification, staging and reporting systems identified in this historical overview, only a few have been evaluated for the purpose for which they were developed. The literature search was limited to PUBMED. Unpublished classification, staging or reporting systems, or those published in books were not considered. It can be concluded that there is no international agreement on how to describe endometriosis or how to classify it, and that most classification/staging systems show no or very little correlation with patient outcomes. This overview of existing systems is a first step in working towards a universally accepted endometriosis classification.

### Time to move beyond surgical classification systems for endometriosis [^112KzPG2]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Endometriosis is a common condition associated with chronic pelvic pain and infertility. Its pathogenesis is poorly understood, diagnosis relies on laparoscopy, and staging is based on extent of disease. Unfortunately, the current staging systems do not correlate well with pain severity and impact, nor do they predict prognosis, i.e., treatment success and recurrence of disease. In this article, we discuss the strengths and limitations of current staging systems and propose modifications that will enable better classification systems to be developed in the future.

### Infertility workup: identifying endometriosis [^115YhjuD]. Fertility and Sterility (2022). Medium credibility.

Endometriosis was classically diagnosed during diagnostic laparoscopies, which used to be routinely performed up until a decade ago or so. This practice fitted with the long-held belief that surgery was the gold standard for diagnosing endometriosis. Today, the abandon of routine diagnostic laparoscopies-in favor of assisted reproductive technology-first therapeutic approaches-has created a void for diagnosing endometriosis. Modern-day imaging techniques-ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging-when used with a systematic approach have offered a reliable replacement option for diagnosing endometriosis. In infertility, endometriosis should be identified or excluded on the basis of past history or confirmation or exclusion suspicion on the basis of history and/or physical examination.

### A practical guide to the clinical evaluation of endometriosis-associated pelvic pain [^114m7dhN]. Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology (2020). Medium credibility.

Endometriosis-associated pain (EAP) has a significant impact on the quality of life of those affected and their families. Recognizing that endometriosis is a chronic condition associated with an impairment in function and negative social impact, there is a shift toward reducing diagnostic delays and initiating timely management. This article provides a comprehensive and practical approach to the clinical diagnosis of EAP, which can subsequently facilitate prompt and directed treatment. The key components of the history, physical examination, and high-quality imaging to evaluate suspected EAP and related pain conditions are presented. Currently, biomarkers have limited utility in the diagnosis of endometriosis, but research in this area continues; development of a reliable noninvasive test for endometriosis may further improve early identification of this condition.

### Magnetic resonance imaging for deep infiltrating endometriosis: current concepts, imaging technique and key findings [^111fAnkq]. Insights Into Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Because of its extreme clinical heterogeneity, pelvic endometriosis remains challenging to diagnose. Current evidence demonstrates that the disease should be diagnosed non-invasively by combining the information from patient history, clinical examination, imaging and response to medical treatment. Because the diagnostic accuracy of MRI may differ depending on radiologist experience, this review article aims to help radiologists obtain meaningful images with a tailored MR-acquisition protocol and recognize a wide range of pelvic changes that may result from endometriosis.

### Barriers to a timely diagnosis of endometriosis: a qualitative systematic review [^112g2vW3]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

The diagnosis of endometriosis, a common gynecologic condition, is characterized by delays of up to 11 years. During this time, women may experience persistent symptoms that affect their quality of life, productivity, and relationships, and the disease may progress. It is therefore a priority to understand the factors that contribute to this delay to help improve the diagnostic pathway. Our objective was to describe the diagnosis barriers of endometriosis from the patient and health care professional perspectives using a qualitative evidence synthesis.

Data Sources

We searched MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature using combinations of the synonyms of endometriosis, diagnosis, and qualitative research. The search was restricted to English-language articles from database creation until May 2022.

Methods Of Study Selection

The initial search yielded 899 articles. Studies were included if they explored the experiences or views of affected women or health care professionals on the diagnosis of endometriosis and used qualitative methods for data collection and data analysis. Risk of bias was assessed with the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme checklist.

Tabulation, Integration, and Results

Thirty-seven articles were considered for full review, with 13 eligible articles identified for inclusion. Thematic synthesis was used to identify four key themes: 1) individual factors (n = 6), 2) interpersonal influences (n = 6), 3) health system factors (n = 13), and 4) factors specific to endometriosis (n = 13). These encompassed 12 subthemes that represented barriers to the diagnosis of endometriosis: 1) difficulty establishing pathologic symptoms from normal menstruation and the use of self-care techniques; 2) menstrual stigma and the normalization of menstrual pain; 3) attitudes and lack of training for health care professionals, delayed referrals to specialist services, and poor explanation of oral contraceptive pill use in the diagnostic process; and 4) variability in presenting symptoms, overlap with other conditions, lack of a noninvasive method of diagnosis, and concerns about the value of a diagnosis.

Conclusion

This review identified barriers to the timely diagnosis of endometriosis from the perspective of affected individuals and health care professionals. It highlights areas for improvement along the diagnostic pathway, which may guide future strategies to reduce delays.

### Magnetic resonance imaging for deep infiltrating endometriosis: current concepts, imaging technique and key findings [^1141p1zr]. Insights Into Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

Key points

Diagnostic laparoscopy is considered the gold standard for endometriosis, but it is invasive with possible false negative results.
Nowadays there is a paradigm shift from surgical to non-invasive diagnosis based on symptoms, response to therapy and imaging.
MRI is highly accurate for the diagnosis of Deep Infiltrating Endometriosis.
The diagnostic results of MRI depend on an accurate imaging technique and on the comprehension of specific MR-findings.

### Biomarkers of endometriosis [^117SZaLN]. Fertility and Sterility (2013). Low credibility.

A noninvasive test for endometriosis would be useful for the early detection of endometriosis in symptomatic women who have pelvic pain and/or subfertility with normal ultrasound results. This would include nearly all cases of minimal-to-mild endometriosis, some cases of moderate-to-severe endometriosis without a clearly visible ovarian endometrioma, and cases with pelvic adhesions and/or other pelvic pathology that might benefit from surgery to improve pelvic pain and/or subfertility. This overview discusses the diagnostic performance of noninvasive or semi-invasive tests for endometriosis, including panels of known peripheral blood biomarkers, protein/peptide markers discovered by proteomics, miRNA, and endometrial nerve fiber density. Tests with high sensitivity and acceptable specificity have been developed; some have been validated in independent populations and are therefore promising. To make real progress, international agreement on biobank development is needed for standard operating procedures for the collection, treatment, storage, and analysis of tissue samples and for detailed clinical phenotyping of these samples. Furthermore, it is necessary to validate the diagnostic accuracy of any promising test prospectively in an independent symptomatic patient population with subfertility and/or pain without clear ultrasound evidence of endometriosis and with a clinical indication for surgery, divided into cases with laparoscopically and histologically confirmed endometriosis and controls with laparoscopically confirmed absence of endometriosis.

### Diagnostic laparoscopy guidelines: this guideline was prepared by the SAGES guidelines committee and reviewed and approved by the board of governors of the Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons (SAGES), November 2007 [^115QZPJp]. Surgical Endoscopy (2008). Medium credibility.

Diagnostic laparoscopy — indications, contraindications, risks, benefits, and diagnostic accuracy for chronic pelvic pain specify that the indication is chronic pelvic pain of unknown etiology after appropriate noninvasive workup. Contraindications include procedure intolerance and known dense pelvic adhesions that may make an accurate evaluation of pelvic pathology impossible or may impede safe abdominal access. Risks are procedure- or anesthesia-related complications. Benefits include potential identification of the source of the chronic pelvic pain, possibility for immediate therapeutic intervention, and potential improvement in the patient's quality of life. Diagnostic laparoscopy has been demonstrated to identify endometriosis, adhesions, or other abnormalities of the appendix and ovaries as the source of chronic pelvic pain.

### Diagnosing diagnostic error of endometriosis: a secondary analysis of patient experiences from a mixed-methods survey [^113oEn2q]. BMJ Open Quality (2025). High credibility.

Conclusion

Despite the high prevalence of endometriosis, the cohort in our study reported clinician failure to recognise and/or definitively diagnose their endometriosis symptoms. This produced prolonged diagnostic delays, often several years. By systematically analysing these diagnostic errors for a large sample of patients with endometriosis, findings suggest that clinicians often erred in their appraisal of symptoms, labelling them as normal menstruation and drawing incorrect conclusions from results of non-discriminatory diagnostic testing. These shortcomings in achieving timely and optimal diagnosis were reported for both general practitioners and OB/GYN generalists and suggest the need for systematically assessing the performance of front-line clinicians and dispelling misinformation. These findings can help patients, clinicians and healthcare organisations design and implement education efforts and safety nets for the anticipation, prevention and/or mitigation of such errors.

### Clinical use of artificial intelligence in endometriosis: a scoping review [^114n2wxj]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Of the 36 studies included in this review, 50% were published in the last 5 years, indicating that there is recent and rapidly growing interest in AI applications to improve diagnostic, predictive and research capabilities for a complex disease such as endometriosis. Further research should be conducted using human comparators and should include comparisons with existing scoring systems and diagnostic tools to determine AI's superiority for predictive and diagnostic modeling in endometriosis. These AI algorithms should also be externally validated or tested through prospective controlled trials to ensure that they contribute to advancing real-world clinical practice and diagnostics. This review was able to identify this interest in AI and highlight the benefits and shortcomings of AI interventions to improve future models for endometriosis.

### What's the delay? A qualitative study of women's experiences of reaching a diagnosis of endometriosis [^116jRJNB]. Fertility and Sterility (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate the reasons women experience delays in the diagnosis of endometriosis and the impact of this.

Design

A qualitative interview-based study of 32 women, 28 of whom were subsequently diagnosed with endometriosis.

Setting

Southeast England.

Patient(S)

Women attending a pelvic pain clinic.

Intervention(S)

Semistructured interviews.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Women's reported experiences of being diagnosed with endometriosis.

Result(S)

Delays in the diagnosis of endometriosis occur at an individual patient level and a medical level, as both women and family doctors normalize symptoms, symptoms are suppressed through hormones, and nondiscriminatory investigations are relied upon. Women benefited from a diagnosis, because it provided a language in which to discuss their condition, offered possible management strategies to control symptoms, and provided reassurance that symptoms were not due to cancer. Diagnosis also sanctioned women's access to social support and legitimized absences from social and work obligations.

Conclusion(S)

Although recent guidelines for the management of chronic pelvic pain suggest that diagnostic laparoscopy may be considered a secondary investigation after the failure of therapeutic interventions, the present study highlights the importance of an early diagnosis for women who suffer at physical, emotional, and social levels when they remain undiagnosed.

### Diagnosing diagnostic error of endometriosis: a secondary analysis of patient experiences from a mixed-methods survey [^1161NmQU]. BMJ Open Quality (2025). High credibility.

Despite the prevalence of diagnostic error in endometriosis, there has been limited research to elucidate reasons contributing to these errors. Of the research that does exist, studies have been limited to qualitative studies with, correspondingly, small sample sizes. The present study thus takes a systematic approach to codifying reasons for diagnostic error in endometriosis, using a large sample of patients with endometriosis, by deductively analysing qualitative data as part of a large mixed-methods research study using taxonomies developed specifically for analysing diagnostic error under the guidance of a diagnostic safety expert.

### Diagnostic laparoscopy guidelines: this guideline was prepared by the SAGES guidelines committee and reviewed and approved by the board of governors of the Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons (SAGES), November 2007 [^114uGjSi]. Surgical Endoscopy (2008). Medium credibility.

Diagnostic laparoscopy for pelvic pain and endometriosis — rationale states that chronic pelvic pain is typically defined as pelvic pain lasting more than 6 months and is a complex disorder with multiple etiologies; it affects many women, can severely impair quality of life, and often remains of obscure etiology despite many diagnostic tests. Diagnostic laparoscopy is described as an excellent tool for direct visualization of the pelvis that may help identify the etiology of patients' pain, facilitates therapeutic intervention, and may help ameliorate the morbidity of an open exploration.

### Urinary biomarkers for the non-invasive diagnosis of endometriosis [^111FrFcv]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

About 10% of reproductive-aged women suffer from endometriosis which is a costly chronic disease that causes pelvic pain and subfertility. Laparoscopy is the 'gold standard' diagnostic test for endometriosis, but it is expensive and carries surgical risks. Currently, there are no simple non-invasive or minimally-invasive tests available in clinical practice that accurately diagnoses endometriosis.

Objectives

1. To provide summary estimates of the diagnostic accuracy of urinary biomarkers for the diagnosis of pelvic endometriosis compared to surgical diagnosis as a reference standard.2. To assess the diagnostic utility of biomarkers that could differentiate ovarian endometrioma from other ovarian masses. Urinary biomarkers were evaluated as replacement tests for surgical diagnosis and as triage tests to inform decisions to undertake surgery for endometriosis.

Search Methods

The searches were not restricted to particular study design, language or publication dates. We searched the following databases to 20 April - 31 July 2015: CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Web of Science, LILACS, OAIster, TRIP and ClinicalTrials.gov (trial register). MEDION, DARE, and PubMed were also searched to identify reviews and guidelines as reference sources of potentially relevant studies. Recently published papers not yet indexed in the major databases were also sought. The search strategy incorporated words in the title, abstract, text words across the record and the medical subject headings (MeSH) and was modified for each database.

Selection Criteria

Published peer-reviewed, randomised controlled or cross-sectional studies of any size were considered, which included prospectively collected samples from any population of reproductive-aged women suspected of having one or more of the following target conditions: ovarian, peritoneal or deep infiltrating endometriosis (DIE). We included studies comparing the diagnostic test accuracy of one or more urinary biomarkers with surgical visualisation of endometriotic lesions.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently collected and performed a quality assessment of the data from each study. For each diagnostic test, the data were classified as positive or negative for the surgical detection of endometriosis and sensitivity and specificity estimates were calculated. If two or more tests were evaluated in the same cohort, each was considered as a separate data set. The bivariate model was used to obtain pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity whenever sufficient data sets were available. The predetermined criteria for a clinically useful urine test to replace diagnostic surgery was one with a sensitivity of 94% and a specificity of 79% to detect endometriosis. The criteria for triage tests were set at sensitivity of equal or greater than 95% and specificity of equal or greater than 50%, which in case of negative result rules out the diagnosis (SnOUT test) or sensitivity of equal or greater than 50% with specificity of equal or greater than 95%, which in case of positive result rules the diagnosis in (SpIN test).

Main Results

We included eight studies involving 646 participants, most of which were of poor methodological quality. The urinary biomarkers were evaluated either in a specific phase of menstrual cycle or irrespective of the cycle phase. Five studies evaluated the diagnostic performance of four urinary biomarkers for endometriosis, including three biomarkers distinguishing women with and without endometriosis (enolase 1 (NNE); vitamin D binding protein (VDBP); and urinary peptide profiling); and one biomarker (cytokeratin 19 (CK 19)) showing no significant difference between the two groups. All of these biomarkers were assessed in small individual studies and could not be statistically evaluated in a meaningful way. None of the biomarkers met the criteria for a replacement test or a triage test. Three studies evaluated three biomarkers that did not differentiate women with endometriosis from disease-free controls.

Authors' Conclusions

There was insufficient evidence to recommend any urinary biomarker for use as a replacement or triage test in clinical practice for the diagnosis of endometriosis. Several urinary biomarkers may have diagnostic potential, but require further evaluation before being introduced into routine clinical practice. Laparoscopy remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of endometriosis, and diagnosis of endometriosis using urinary biomarkers should only be undertaken in a research setting.

### Diagnosis of endometriosis and pelvic pain [^116bx5kq]. Fertility and Sterility (2006). Low credibility.

Both the American and the Royal Colleges of Obstetricians and Gynecologists have produced guidelines that recommend patients with chronic pelvic pain, including those suspected of having endometriosis, should receive empirical medical therapy without a preliminary diagnostic laparoscopy. This paper reviews the implications of this approach.

### When to Do surgery and when not to Do surgery for endometriosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112Z6wRP]. Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis with the aim to answer whether operative laparoscopy is an effective treatment in a woman with demonstrated endometriosis compared with alternative treatments. Moreover, we aimed to assess the risks of operative laparoscopy compared with those of alternatives. In addition, we aimed to systematically review the literature on the impact of patient preference on decision making around surgery.

Data Sources

We searched MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, ClinicalTrials.gov, CINAHL, Scopus, OpenGrey, and Web of Science from inception through May 2019. In addition, a manual search of reference lists of relevant studies was conducted.

Methods Of Study Selection

Published and unpublished randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in any language describing a comparison between surgery and any other intervention were included, with particular reference to timing and its impact on pain and fertility. Studies reporting on keywords including, but not limited to, endometriosis, laparoscopy, pelvic pain, and infertility were included. In the anticipated absence of RCTs on patient preference, all original research on this topic was considered eligible.

Tabulation, Integration, and Results

In total, 1990 studies were reviewed. Twelve studies were identified as being eligible for inclusion to assess outcomes of pain (n = 6), fertility (n = 7), quality of life (n = 1), and disease progression (n = 3). Seven studies of interest were identified to evaluate patient preferences. There is evidence that operative laparoscopy may improve overall pain levels at 6 months compared with diagnostic laparoscopy (risk ratio [RR], 2.65; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.61–4.34; p < .001; 2 RCTs, 102 participants; low-quality evidence). Because the quality of the evidence was very low, it is uncertain if operative laparoscopy improves live birth rates. Operative laparoscopy probably yields little or no difference regarding clinical pregnancy rates compared with diagnostic laparoscopy (RR, 1.29; 95% CI, 0.99–1.92; p = .06; 4 RCTs, 624 participants; moderate-quality evidence). It is uncertain if operative laparoscopy yields a difference in adverse outcomes when compared with diagnostic laparoscopy (RR, 1.98; 95% CI, 0.84–4.65; p = .12; 5 RCTs, 554 participants; very-low-quality evidence). No studies reported on the progression of endometriosis to a symptomatic state or progression of extent of disease in terms of volume of lesions and locations in asymptomatic women with endometriosis. We found no studies that reported on the timing of surgery. No quantitative or qualitative studies specifically aimed at elucidating the factors informing a woman's choice for surgery were identified.

Conclusion

Operative laparoscopy may improve overall pain levels but may have little or no difference with respect to fertility-related or adverse outcomes when compared with diagnostic laparoscopy. Additional high-quality RCTs, including comparing surgery to medical management, are needed, and these should report adverse events as an outcome. Studies on patient preference in surgical decision making are needed (International Prospective Register of Systematic Review registration number: CRD42019135167).

### A new validated screening method for endometriosis diagnosis based on patient questionnaires [^114Kgh8z]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). Medium credibility.

We are at a key stage regarding the diagnosis and management of endometriosis, both of which warrant being extensively reconsidered. As histological diagnosis is no longer required to initiate treatment(s), there is a high level of interest in non-invasive (i.e. non-surgical) ways to diagnose endometriosis. The selection of patients requiring a radiological evaluation based on a simple patient questionnaire is crucial for the medical care. Very high-risk patients need to be referred to a multidisciplinary specialized team (expert radiologists, multidisciplinary surgical team (gynecological, GI, urological, and thoracic surgeons), assisted reproductive technology (ART) specialists, gynecological endocrinologists, pathologists, physiotherapists, psychologists, etc.). If a patient is at high risk with a negative radiological examination, SPE cannot be excluded, and the patient is managed accordingly for suspected endometriosis. This new paradigm regarding endometriosis diagnosis, based on the patient's clinical history and imaging, allows use of a non-surgical procedure to devise an individualized therapeutic strategy (medical treatment, surgery, or ART) for each patient. In selected cases, medical treatment and ART can be satisfactory alternatives to surgery, which is usually proposed too often as the first therapeutic option.

In conclusion, we have developed two internally and externally validated scores based solely on 8 and 5 items, respectively, from a patient questionnaire that reliably predict the probability of endometriosis. These scores may have high clinical value, allowing the selection of patients at high-risk of endometriosis with a cost-effective procedure that can readily be performed by the patient herself. These scores will contribute to shortening the delay of the diagnosis and improvement of the management, wellbeing, and quality of life of patients. The accumulation of data is likely to help progressively improve the performance of this straightforward and cost-effective screening score.

### Rethinking mechanisms, diagnosis and management of endometriosis [^113fTVX7]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2019). High credibility.

Endometriosis is a chronic inflammatory disease defined as the presence of endometrial tissue outside the uterus, which causes pelvic pain and infertility. This disease should be viewed as a public health problem with a major effect on the quality of life of women as well as being a substantial economic burden. In light of the considerable progress with diagnostic imaging (for example, transvaginal ultrasound and MRI), exploratory laparoscopy should no longer be used to diagnose endometriotic lesions. Instead, diagnosis of endometriosis should be based on a structured process involving the combination of patient interviews, clinical examination and imaging. Notably, a diagnosis of endometriosis often leads to immediate surgery. Therefore, rethinking the diagnosis and management of endometriosis is warranted. Instead of assessing endometriosis on the day of the diagnosis, gynaecologists should consider the patient's 'endometriosis life'. Medical treatment is the first-line therapeutic option for patients with pelvic pain and no desire for immediate pregnancy. In women with infertility, careful consideration should be made regarding whether to provide assisted reproductive technologies prior to performing endometriosis surgery. Modern endometriosis management should be individualized with a patient-centred, multi-modal and interdisciplinary integrated approach.

### Future directions in endometriosis research [^117NL5K8]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Future research in endometriosis must focus on pathogenesis studies in the baboon model, the early interactions between endometrial and peritoneal cells in the pelvic cavity at the time of menstruation, and potential differences between eutopic endometrium and myometrium in women with and without endometriosis. More integration is needed between the areas of epidemiology and genetics. Pelvic inflammation in women with endometriosis could be the target for new diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. Important questions remain regarding the relationship between endometriosis and environmental factors. Systemic and extrapelvic manifestations of endometriosis must be analyzed carefully, and better tools are needed to measure quality of life in women with chronic pain caused by endometriosis. Most current evidence supports a causal relationship between endometriosis and subfertility, and the spontaneous progressive nature of endometriosis has been demonstrated in 30% to 60% of patients. Recurrence of endometriosis after classic medical and surgical therapy is a major and underestimated problem, especially in women with advanced disease. Integrated clinical and research teams are needed that combine expert medical, surgical, and holistic care with state-of-the-art research expertise in immunology, endocrinology, and genetics to discover new diagnostic methods and medical treatments for endometriosis.

### European Society of Urogenital Radiology (ESUR) guidelines: MR imaging of pelvic endometriosis [^1151w7Ab]. European Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Abstract

Endometriosis is a common gynaecological condition of unknown aetiology that primarily affects women of reproductive age. The accepted first-line imaging modality is pelvic ultrasound. However, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is increasingly performed as an additional investigation in complex cases and for surgical planning. There is currently no international consensus regarding patient preparation, MRI protocols or reporting criteria. Our aim was to develop clinical guidelines for MRI evaluation of pelvic endometriosis based on literature evidence and consensus expert opinion. This work was performed by a group of radiologists from the European Society of Urogenital Radiology (ESUR), experts in gynaecological imaging and a gynaecologist expert in methodology. The group discussed indications for MRI, technical requirements, patient preparation, MRI protocols and criteria for the diagnosis of pelvic endometriosis on MRI. The expert panel proposed a final recommendation for each criterion using Oxford Centre for Evidence Based Medicine (OCEBM) 2011 levels of evidence.

Key Points

- This report provides guidelines for MRI in endometriosis.

- Minimal and optimal MRI acquisition protocols are provided.

- Recommendations are proposed for patient preparation, best MRI sequences and reporting criteria.

### Diagnosis and management of endometriosis [^1175VBxn]. American Family Physician (2006). Low credibility.

Signs and symptoms of endometriosis are nonspecific, and an acceptably accurate noninvasive diagnostic test has yet to be reported. Serum markers do not provide adequate diagnostic accuracy. The preferred method for diagnosis of endometriosis is surgical visual inspection of pelvic organs with histologic confirmation. Such diagnosis requires an experienced surgeon because the varied appearance of the disease allows less-obvious lesions to be overlooked. Empiric use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or acetaminophen is a reasonable symptomatic treatment, but the effectiveness of these agents has not been well-studied. Oral contraceptive pills, medroxyprogesterone acetate, and intrauterine levonorgestrel are relatively effective for pain relief. Danazol and various gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues also are effective but may have significant side effects. There is limited evidence that surgical ablation of endometriotic deposits may decrease pain and increase fertility rates in women with endometriosis. Presacral neurectomy is particularly beneficial in women with midline pelvic pain. Hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy definitively treat pain from endometriosis at 10 years in 90 percent of patients.

### Diagnosing diagnostic error of endometriosis: a secondary analysis of patient experiences from a mixed-methods survey [^116Gmax2]. BMJ Open Quality (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Recent patient safety efforts have focused on diagnostic error, defined as 'the failure to (a) establish an accurate and timely explanation of the patient's health problem(s) or (b) communicate that explanation to the patient'. Diagnostic errors have an incidence of 10–15% in the general medical field and are the most common and costly reason for medical malpractice claims and contribute significantly to preventable patient harm.

One diagnosis that deserves special attention in people assigned female at birth is endometriosis, the most common non-malignant gynaecological disease. Endometriosis is broadly defined as the presence of endometrial-like tissue in ectopic location. Common symptoms include chronic pelvic pain, dysmenorrhoea, dyspareunia, fatigue and infertility. Endometriosis is diagnosed in roughly 10% of people assigned female at birth — roughly equivalent to the prevalence of type 2 diabetes in the USA. Endometriosis is associated with significant physical and psychological morbidity and contributes to economic burden. Currently, endometriosis can be definitively diagnosed only through surgical visualisation and histological confirmation of biopsied lesions, though there is emerging evidence that advanced ultrasonography can be used as a diagnostic tool by trained specialists in endometriosis.

Despite its high prevalence, diagnostic error is pervasive in endometriosis, being described as 'a common and commonly missed and delayed diagnosis'.75.2% of non-randomly sampled US patients with endometriosis reported having had their endometriosis misdiagnosed, with a mean diagnostic delay ranging from 8 to 12 years. A recent systematic review of qualitative studies identified reasons for diagnostic delay and included patient factors, social factors, clinician factors and disease-specific factors. Patient factors include difficulty differentiating pathological symptoms from normal menstruation and self-care techniques. Social factors include menstrual stigma and normalisation of menstrual pain by other females. Clinician and health system factors include dismissal of endometriosis symptoms by clinicians (ie, symptom invalidation), clinicians' poor knowledge of endometriosis, delayed referral to specialist services and poor explanation of the contraceptive pill in the diagnostic process (ie, clinicians using response to oral contraceptives as a diagnostic criterion). Disease-specific factors include variability in presenting symptoms and overlap with other conditions, lack of a non-invasive method of definitive diagnosis and concerns about the value of reaching a definitive diagnosis.

### ESUR consensus MRI for endometriosis: indications, reporting, and classifications [^113yzihh]. European Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To propose an update of ESUR endometriosis guidelines to reflect advances in MRI indications, reporting, and classifications.

Methods

The ESUR Research Committee appointed two chairs (I.T.N. L.M.) to supervise the development of the updated guidelines. Following literature research, a survey was delivered to 20 experts in gynecological imaging from 10 countries. Two rounds of surveys were conducted to obtain a consensus according to a Delphi process method. In this article, the results regarding MR indication, the use of standardized reports, and classifications are presented

Results

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is recommended when transvaginal ultrasonography is inconclusive in diagnosing endometriosis or negative, in a symptomatic patient, before surgery or interventional procedure, or after surgical treatment if symptoms persist. ESUR panelists consider the roles of an MR classification: to improve communication between radiologist and surgeon (100%, 20/20) and between the radiologist and the patient (45%, 9/20), to predict operating time if surgery is planned (70%, 14/20), to predict the length of hospital stay after surgery (40%, 8/20), and to predict postoperative complications (70%, 14/20). ESUR panelists strongly agree that using an MR classification is useful (19/20, 95%), especially the radiological score, deep-pelvic endometriosis index (dPEI). Among the ESUR expert group, 9/20 experts (45%) used or agreed to use drawings in their report to improve communication with patients.

Conclusion

Standardized MR reporting is crucial and should include the use of MR classification. Drawings are considered an option, knowing that communication with the patient and surgeon is of paramount importance.

Key Points

Question ESUR's endometriosis guidelines were last published in 2017; an update is provided to reflect advances in MRI indications, reporting, and classifications.

Findings MRI is advised for inconclusive/negative transvaginal ultrasound in symptomatic patients, before surgery, or post-treatment if symptoms persist. A structured report enhances communication with surgeons and patients.

Clinical relevance A standardized report based on a compartmental analysis of the location of endometriotic nodules, with optional drawings, is essential for comprehensive mapping and optimal communication with both patient and surgeon.

### Global trends in the uptake of specialist diagnostic ultrasound and MRI scans for endometriosis: an international cross-sectional survey [^112q4tfx]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Endometriosis affects 1 in 10 women globally. We aimed to determine health provider involvement and preferred methods of obtaining an endometriosis diagnosis across international jurisdictions. A global cross-sectional survey, distributed through formal and informal FIGO Reproductive Medicine, Endocrinology, and Infertility (REI) committee networks from September through October 2024. A total of 445 respondents from 76 countries began the survey, with 360 completions. Of the respondents, 63.9% were female, with most being gynecologists. Academics and/or researchers comprised 6.7%, with 39.2% involved in research in some capacity. Endometriosis was largely diagnosed by gynecologists (95.0%), with most respondents overall describing ultrasound as the most common method of diagnosis (77.8%). Of those surveyed, 93.6% stated clinicians in their country used non-invasive imaging (predominantly ultrasound) to diagnose endometriosis before surgery. One third of respondents did not feel confident distinguishing between routine gynecological scans and specialist endometriosis imaging. Significant barriers for uptake of imaging diagnostics included access to training, cost, and geographical accessibility. Regarding adoption of non-invasive imaging in clinical care, "game-changing" effects were described, including improvements in surgical preoperative mapping, and patient-centered care, with concerns that it could increase clinical workloads. Significantly, shifts in endometriosis diagnosis, from visualization of lesions at laparoscopy to non-invasive imaging diagnostics, were observed internationally. Policies should aim to overcome barriers to uptake of imaging-based diagnostics by supporting training initiatives, reducing associated costs, and improving geographical accessibility. Respondents predicted transformative changes in endometriosis care once non-invasive endometriosis diagnostics are effectively adopted.

### Introduction: from pathogenesis to therapy, deep endometriosis remains a source of controversy [^116No86T]. Fertility and Sterility (2017). Low credibility.

Deep endometriosis remains a source of controversy. A number of theories may explain its pathogenesis and many arguments support the hypothesis that genetic or epigenetic changes are a prerequisite for development of lesions into deep endometriosis. Deep endometriosis is frequently responsible for pelvic pain, dysmenorrhea, and/or deep dyspareunia, but can also cause obstetrical complications. Diagnosis may be improved by high-quality imaging. Therapeutic approaches are a source of contention as well. In this issue's Views and Reviews, medical and surgical strategies are discussed, and it is emphasized that treatment should be designed according to a patient's symptoms and individual needs. It is also vital that referral centers have the knowledge and experience to treat deep endometriosis medically and/or surgically. The debate must continue because emerging trends in therapy need to be followed and investigated for optimal management.

### Crimson clues: advancing endometriosis detection and management with novel blood biomarkers [^112m7H4k]. Fertility and Sterility (2024). Medium credibility.

Endometriosis is an inflammatory condition affecting approximately 10% of the female-born population. Despite its prevalence, the lack of noninvasive biomarkers has contributed to an established global diagnostic delay. The intricate pathophysiology of this enigmatic disease may leave signatures in the blood, which, when detected, can be used as noninvasive biomarkers. This review provides an update on how investigators are utilizing the established disease pathways and innovative methodologies, including genome-wide association studies, next-generation sequencing, and machine learning, to unravel the clues left in the blood to develop blood biomarkers. Many blood biomarkers show promise in the discovery phase, but because of a lack of standardized and robust methodologies, they rarely progress to the development stages. However, we are now seeing biomarkers being validated with high diagnostic accuracy and improvements in standardization protocols, providing promise for the future of endometriosis blood biomarkers.

### Endometriosis [^117Lm7UR]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2018). Medium credibility.

Endometriosis is a common inflammatory disease characterized by the presence of tissue outside the uterus that resembles endometrium, mainly on pelvic organs and tissues. It affects ~5–10% of women in their reproductive years - translating to 176 million women worldwide - and is associated with pelvic pain and infertility. Diagnosis is reliably established only through surgical visualization with histological verification, although ovarian endometrioma and deep nodular forms of disease can be detected through ultrasonography and MRI. Retrograde menstruation is regarded as an important origin of the endometrial deposits, but other factors are involved, including a favourable endocrine and metabolic environment, epithelial-mesenchymal transition and altered immunity and inflammatory responses in genetically susceptible women. Current treatments are dictated by the primary indication (infertility or pelvic pain) and are limited to surgery and hormonal treatments and analgesics with many adverse effects that rarely provide long-term relief. Endometriosis substantially affects the quality of life of women and their families and imposes costs on society similar to those of other chronic conditions such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, Crohn's disease and rheumatoid arthritis. Future research must focus on understanding the pathogenesis, identifying disease subtypes, developing non-invasive diagnostic methods and targeting non-hormonal treatments that are acceptable to women who wish to conceive.

### Endometriosis revisited: an imaging review of the usual and unusual manifestations with pathological correlation [^111QGuZm]. Clinical Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

The manifestations of endometriosis commonly present a diagnostic challenge to the gynecologist and radiologist. Familiarity with its varied presentations may allow for a more accurate diagnosis. The goal of this review is to the present the imaging spectrum of endometriosis, less common sites of involvement as well as the potential rare complications. Relevant surgical and histopathological correlation is also provided. In addition to clinical evaluation and sonography, MRI is a highly accurate imaging modality in the diagnosis of endometriosis. It possesses a distinctive advantage over other modalities in that it allows a complete survey of the pelvic compartments. The potentially devastating effects of endometriosis include pelvic pain and even infertility. Since standard treatment is surgical, the radiologist needs to be familiar with the various manifestations in order to aid diagnosis for appropriate management.

### Incidence of endometriosis by study population and diagnostic method: the ENDO study [^11639WC7]. Fertility and Sterility (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To estimate the incidence of endometriosis in an operative cohort of women seeking clinical care and in a matched population cohort to delineate more fully the scope and magnitude of endometriosis in the context of and beyond clinical care.

Design

Matched-exposure cohort design.

Setting

Surgical centers in the Salt Lake City, Utah, and San Francisco, California, areas.

Patient(S)

The operative cohort comprised 495 women undergoing laparoscopy/laparotomy between 2007 and 2009, and the population cohort comprised 131 women from the surgical centers' catchment areas.

Intervention(S)

None.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Incidence of endometriosis by diagnostic method in the operative cohort and by pelvic magnetic resonance imaged (MRI) disease in the population cohort.

Result(S)

Endometriosis incidence in the operative cohort ranged by two orders of magnitude by diagnostic method: 0.7% for only histology, 7% for only MRI, and 41% for visualized disease. Endometriosis staging was skewed toward minimal (58%) and mild disease (15%). The incidence of MRI-diagnosed endometriosis was 11% in the population cohort.

Conclusion(S)

Endometriosis incidence is dependent on the diagnostic method and choice of sampling framework. Conservatively, 11% of women have undiagnosed endometriosis at the population level, with implications for the design and interpretation of etiologic research.

### Best practices: ultrasound versus MRI in the assessment of pelvic endometriosis [^116yNWDM]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2024). Medium credibility.

Endometriosis is a common yet morbid disease. Imaging plays an important role in diagnosis and treatment planning. Both ultrasound (US) and MRI are used to detect disease. We performed a literature review to assess whether one is superior. A total of 33 studies from the 4482 identified in the initial search were found to assess the efficacy of US and/or MRI in detecting pelvic endometriosis. Most studies were performed at centers with extensive experience with endometriosis, using dedicated US and MRI protocols. A wide range of sensitivities and specificities were reported, but overall weighted means of diagnostic statistics for US and MRI were similar. The choice of dedicated US versus dedicated MRI in the evaluation of endometriosis should therefore be based on the expertise in the region. The data also showed US had better accuracy than MRI for identifying the depth of wall invasion in bowel-wall disease, whereas MRI better depicted pelvic-wall and extraperitoneal disease than US. Routine US and MRI protocols performed worse than dedicated US and MRI protocols, which may account for delays in diagnoses. Clinical and research efforts directed at improving the sensitivity of routine imaging for diagnosing deep endometriosis could improve patient access to appropriate care.

### Clinical use of artificial intelligence in endometriosis: a scoping review [^113gVeaR]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study guidelines

Given the heterogeneity and breadth of research in this field, a scoping review was performed to summarize the use of AI applications in endometriosis research, diagnostics, and prediction to help identify gaps in knowledge and address broad research questions. The guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses for Scoping Review (PRISMA-ScR)and Arksey and O'Malley's recommendations for scoping review methodologywere followed. A prior review protocol was drafted using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Protocolsfor internal use amongst the research team but it was not externally published or registered prospectively.

Search strategy and study eligibility

The PubMed, Medline-OVID, EMBASE, and CINAHL databases were searched sequentially from January 2000 to March 2022 for all English-language papers using the following search strategy (adapted for each database): [(Endometriosis) OR (Endometrioma)] AND [(AI) OR (ML) OR (Prediction Model) OR (Classification)]. Gray literature was not included in this scoping review in attempt to only include peer-reviewed studies. This timeframe was chosen to reflect advances in AI technologies and applications in medicine. The scope of the search was not restricted to a particular type or stage of endometriosis. The search for this scoping review was completed in March 2022.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria

The following inclusion criteria were used to determine study eligibility for this review: (1) the study involved assessing an AI approach or model to advance prediction, diagnosis, management or disease understanding in the field of endometriosis; (2) the study reported a quantitative metric on the accuracy/performance of the AI method; (3) the study was conducted using humans; (4) the article was accessible in English; and (5) the study used a validation method to test its model. Studies were excluded if: (1) they were not conducted using humans; (2) did not assess or evaluate an AI approach or model; (3) did not pertain to the field of endometriosis; and (4) developed a logistic regression model without the use of a training and test/validation set. One reviewer (BS) conducted the literature search and two reviewers (BS and ME) screened the titles, abstracts and full-texts independently for potentially eligible studies. Reference lists of eligible studies were also hand-searched but no additional studies were included on this basis.

### Endometriosis: clinical features, MR imaging findings and pathologic correlation [^115f4cZQ]. Insights Into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Endometriosis is a chronic condition affecting women during the reproductive lifespan. Diagnosis of endometriosis must take into account clinical symptoms, physical examination, laboratory tests and different imaging techniques. Since pelvic anatomy is complex and may vary with distortion by invasive endometriosis, the radiologist must be aware of both normal and deranged anatomy.

The ideal purpose of surgery is a therapeutic and effective intervention based on a careful preoperative evaluation. From this point of view, the role of MR imaging to help diagnose and plan surgical strategy is critical in the management of the disease. Preoperative detection of all endometriotic lesions is recommended to choose the surgical approach and to plan a multidisciplinary team work. This multidisciplinary approach including radiologists, gynaecologists, urologists, gastrointestinal surgeons, and (in selected cases) neurosurgeons, is recommended to improve diagnostic imaging accuracy and patients' outcome, and to reduce postoperative complication rates. The recent awareness that endometriosis may be medically treated based on strong clinical suspicion and that laparoscopy should be intended for surgical treatment, not for diagnostic purposes, furtherly enhance the role of non-invasive diagnostic procedures and particularly of MR imaging.

In any case, due to the complexity of the disease, it is appropriate to centralize the overall care of endometriosis patients to reference centres in order to pursue a patient-centred approach tailored to the patient's specific condition and desires.

### Noninvasive diagnostic imaging for endometriosis part 1: a systematic review of recent developments in ultrasound, combination imaging, and artificial intelligence [^113qsDGE]. Fertility and Sterility (2024). Medium credibility.

Endometriosis affects 1 in 9 women and those assigned female at birth. However, it takes 6.4 years to diagnose using the conventional standard of laparoscopy. Noninvasive imaging enables a timelier diagnosis, reducing diagnostic delay as well as the risk and expense of surgery. This review updates the exponentially increasing literature exploring the diagnostic value of endometriosis specialist transvaginal ultrasound (eTVUS), combinations of eTVUS and specialist magnetic resonance imaging, and artificial intelligence. Concentrating on literature that emerged after the publication of the IDEA consensus in 2016, we identified 6192 publications and reviewed 49 studies focused on diagnosing endometriosis using emerging imaging techniques. The diagnostic performance of eTVUS continues to improve but there are still limitations. eTVUS reliably detects ovarian endometriomas, shows high specificity for deep endometriosis and should be considered diagnostic. However, a negative scan cannot preclude endometriosis as eTVUS shows moderate sensitivity scores for deep endometriosis, with the sonographic evaluation of superficial endometriosis still in its infancy. The fast-growing area of artificial intelligence in endometriosis detection is still evolving, but shows great promise, particularly in the area of combined multimodal techniques. We finalize our commentary by exploring the implications of practice change for surgeons, sonographers, radiologists, and fertility specialists. Direct benefits for endometriosis patients include reduced diagnostic delay, better access to targeted therapeutics, higher quality operative procedures, and improved fertility treatment plans.

### Endometriosis: diagnosis and management [^115UeYbU]. Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Canada (2010). Medium credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for endometriosis, more specifically with respect to clinical presentation, SOGC 2010 guidelines recommend to recognize that:

- symptoms of endometriosis may vary, but certain hallmark symptoms may be more likely to suggest endometriosis; recognize the atypical presentations

- endometriosis can be a chronic, relapsing disorder, which may necessitate a long-term follow-up

- adolescent patients with endometriosis are more likely than adult patients to present with acyclic pain

- physical examination of adolescent patients with endometriosis will rarely reveal abnormalities, as most will have early-stage disease

- endometriosis in adolescent patients is often early-stage and atypical.

### Clinical use of artificial intelligence in endometriosis: a scoping review [^116YPMyK]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Endometriosis is a chronic, debilitating, gynecologic condition with a non-specific clinical presentation. Globally, patients can experience diagnostic delays of ~6 to 12 years, which significantly hinders adequate management and places a significant financial burden on patients and the healthcare system. Through artificial intelligence (AI), it is possible to create models that can extract data patterns to act as inputs for developing interventions with predictive and diagnostic accuracies that are superior to conventional methods and current tools used in standards of care. This literature review explored the use of AI methods to address different clinical problems in endometriosis. Approximately 1309 unique records were found across four databases; among those, 36 studies met the inclusion criteria. Studies were eligible if they involved an AI approach or model to explore endometriosis pathology, diagnostics, prediction, or management and if they reported evaluation metrics (sensitivity and specificity) after validating their models. Only articles accessible in English were included in this review. Logistic regression was the most popular machine learning method, followed by decision tree algorithms, random forest, and support vector machines. Approximately 44.4% (n = 16) of the studies analyzed the predictive capabilities of AI approaches in patients with endometriosis, while 47.2% (n = 17) explored diagnostic capabilities, and 8.33% (n = 3) used AI to improve disease understanding. Models were built using different data types, including biomarkers, clinical variables, metabolite spectra, genetic variables, imaging data, mixed methods, and lesion characteristics. Regardless of the AI-based endometriosis application (either diagnostic or predictive), pooled sensitivities ranged from 81.7 to 96.7%, and pooled specificities ranged between 70.7 and 91.6%. Overall, AI models displayed good diagnostic and predictive capacity in detecting endometriosis using simple classification scenarios (i.e. differentiating between cases and controls), showing promising directions for AI in assessing endometriosis in the near future. This timely review highlighted an emerging area of interest in endometriosis and AI. It also provided recommendations for future research in this field to improve the reproducibility of results and comparability between models, and further test the capacity of these models to enhance diagnosis, prediction, and management in endometriosis patients.

### Postmenopausal endometriosis: a challenging condition beyond menopause [^1161Asmf]. Menopause (2024). Medium credibility.

Importance and Objective

Postmenopausal endometriosis is a complex condition that challenges the conventional belief that endometriosis resolves with menopause. Despite the cessation of menstruation, a subset of women continues to experience or develop endometriosis-related symptoms during the postmenopausal period. Thus, this review aimed to shed light on postmenopausal endometriosis, exploring its clinical features, diagnostic considerations, management approaches, and the potential impact on women's health.

Methods

PubMed/Medline, Scopus, and Web of Science databases were used for the research, with only articles in English language, using the following terms: "postmenopausal endometriosis", "menopause", "management", "treatment", and "quality of life", from inception to 2023.

Discussion and Conclusion

The clinical features of postmenopausal endometriosis include persistent or recurrent pelvic pain, dyspareunia, bowel, or urinary symptoms and, occasionally, abnormal vaginal bleeding. The absence of menstrual cycles presents a diagnostic challenge, as the traditional diagnostic criteria for endometriosis rely on menstrual patterns. Visual cues may be less evident, and the symptoms often overlap with other gynecological conditions, necessitating a thorough evaluation to differentiate postmenopausal endometriosis from other potential causes. Management approaches for postmenopausal endometriosis encompass surgical intervention, hormonal therapies, pain management, and individualized care. Postmenopausal endometriosis significantly impacts the quality of life, sexual health, and long-term well-being of women. Understanding the clinical features, diagnostic challenges, and management approaches of postmenopausal endometriosis is crucial for healthcare professionals to provide effective care and to improve the quality of life of women affected by this condition.

### ACOG updates guideline on diagnosis and treatment of… [^112oPEmZ]. AAFP (2011). Low credibility.

Endometriosis is a chronic gynecologic disorder that commonly manifests as chronic pain and infertility. It affects 6 to 10 percent of women of reproductive age, and it is present in approximately 38 percent of women with infertility and in up to 87 percent of women with chronic pelvic pain. It is thought to develop from attachment and implantation of endometrial glands and stroma on the peritoneum as a result of retrograde menstruation. Endometrial lesions result from overproduction of prostaglandins and estrogen, which leads to chronic inflammation. Diagnosis Diagnostic evaluation of women with pelvic pain should include a thorough history and physical examination to rule out other gynecologic causes of pain. Nongynecologic causes can be ruled out with appropriate testing and referrals, if necessary.

Definitive diagnosis of endometriosis can be made only by histology of lesions that have been removed surgically. Imaging studies cannot be used to diagnose endometriosis, but they can be useful in patients with pelvic or adnexal masses. Ovarian endometriomas typically appear on ultrasonography as cysts that contain low-level homogeneous internal echoes consistent with old blood. Imaging alone seems to be highly predictive in differentiating ovarian endometriomas from other adnexal masses. Transvaginal ultrasonography is the preferred imaging modality to determine the presence of endometriosis and deeply infiltrating endometriosis of the rectum or recto-vaginal septum. Magnetic resonance imaging should be reserved for patients with equivocal ultrasound results and in whom rectovaginal or bladder endometriosis is suspected.

Treatment INITIAL TREATMENT Progestins, danazol, extended-cycle combined oral contraceptives, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists can be used for initial treatment of pain in women with suspected endometriosis. However, recurrence rates are high after the medication is discontinued. If initial therapy is unsuccessful, diagnostic laparoscopy can be offered to confirm the diagnosis. Alternatively, empiric treatment with another suppressive medication is an option. Empiric therapy with a three-month course of a GnRH agonist is appropriate if initial treatment with oral contraceptives and NSAIDs is unsuccessful. It is important to explain to the patient that response to empiric therapy does not confirm the diagnosis of endometriosis.

### An international terminology for endometriosis, 2021 [^114MhAcX]. Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

Different classification systems have been developed for endometriosis, using different definitions for the disease, the different subtypes, symptoms and treatments. In addition, an International Glossary on Infertility and Fertility Care has been published in 2017 by the International Committee for Monitoring Assisted Reproductive Technologies (ICMART) in collaboration with other organisations. An international working group convened over the development of a classification or descriptive system for endometriosis. As a basis for such system, a terminology for endometriosis was considered a condition sine qua non. The aim of the current study was to develop a set of terms and definitions be prepared on endometriosis that would be the basis for standardization in disease description, classification and research.

Data Sources

The working group listed a number of terms relevant to be included in the terminology, documented currently used and published definitions, and discussed and adapted them until consensus was reached within the working group. Following stakeholder review, further terms were added, and definitions further clarified. Although definitions were collected through published literature, the final set of terms and definitions is to be considered consensus-based. After finalization of the first draft, the members of the international societies and other stakeholders were consulted for feedback and comments, which lead to further adaptations.

Methods Of Study Selection

na TABULATION, INTEGRATION, AND RESULTS: A list of 49 terms and definitions in the field of endometriosis is presented, including a definition for endometriosis and its subtypes, different locations, interventions, symptoms and outcomes. Endometriosis is defined as a disease characterized by the presence of endometrium-like epithelium and/or stroma outside the endometrium and myometrium, usually with an associated inflammatory process.

Conclusion

The current paper outlines a list of 49 terms and definitions in the field of endometriosis. The application of the defined terms aims to facilitate harmonization in endometriosis research and clinical practice. Future research may require further refinement of the presented definitions.

### Evaluation and management of women with endometriosis [^113MzMa7]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2003). Low credibility.

Endometriosis is a condition that often leads to a variety of symptoms that range from pain complaints to infertility. Endometriosis is also found in women who are asymptomatic. The diagnosis of endometriosis can be made clinically with reliability similar to that of one made surgically. Medical treatment options are effective, as are surgical treatment options. Complications associated with surgery, however, push the balance in favor of medical therapy whenever possible. Based on the body of evidence available at present, women with endometriosis-related complaints should be treated with a first-line medical therapy. If that fails, a second-line medical therapy is warranted under most conditions. Laparoscopic surgery should be reserved for patients in whom second-line medical therapy has failed or is contraindicated by desire to conceive immediately or as soon as possible.

### A new validated screening method for endometriosis diagnosis based on patient questionnaires [^113P3s82]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). Medium credibility.

The strength of the study lies with the large number of patients, the accurate diagnosis based on histology and surgical exploration, the prospective collection of data minimizing the number of missing data and bias, and the external validation of the score in addition to the internal validation, which has never been done before. However, our study also has some weaknesses and limitations: (i) patients who had surgery may not be representative of the entire population of patients with endometriosis, and (ii) the controls had gynecological surgical pathologies, which could mean that they were different from the general population. Unfortunately, all the other selection methods that have been used to date have their own biases and disadvantages that can interfere even more negatively in a diagnostic methodology. Patients undergoing surgery may not represent the broader population of endometriosis-affected women. However, a surgical population with histological proof allows us to be certain of the endometriotic nature of the lesions in patients and the absence of silent endometriosis in the controls. The high prevalence of GI lesions in the patients undergoing surgery for endometriosis in our department may have increased the β coefficient of the GI symptoms. Moreover, the number of patients required to prove the absence of a difference between the derivation and the external cohort may have been too small. However, the diagnostic performance of the score applied to the external control cohort was nonetheless good and significant.

### Endometriosis and infertility: a committee opinion [^116SJhqY]. Fertility and Sterility (2012). Medium credibility.

Endometriosis — diagnosis and staging emphasize that laparoscopy is required for a definitive diagnosis and histologic evaluation is warranted when visual inspection is inconclusive; history and physical findings suggestive of endometriosis include cyclic or chronic pelvic pain, dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, a fixed retroverted uterus, an adnexal mass, and uterosacral ligament nodularity, thickening, or tenderness; ultrasound can help establish a presumptive diagnosis of an ovarian endometrioma but cannot reliably image peritoneal implants; the therapeutic benefit of laparoscopy to increase fecundity in mild disease is minimal and, accordingly, laparoscopy of asymptomatic women with infertility simply to rule out or confirm disease is unwarranted; disease heterogeneity ranges from a single 1 mm peritoneal implant to ≥ 10 cm endometriomas.

### Diagnosing diagnostic error of endometriosis: a secondary analysis of patient experiences from a mixed-methods survey [^111WtGY4]. BMJ Open Quality (2025). High credibility.

Diagnostic testing

Failure to perform diagnostic testing

Given the frequency in patient responses that symptoms are misattributed to normal menstruation or another benign process (eg, constipation, gas) rather than to something potentially pathological, history-taking and diagnostic testing were foregone. Thus, the large number of cases where there was a reported failure/delay in ordering needed test(s) (tests main category) was not surprising. In many cases, no imaging (eg, ultrasonography) was ordered and/or performed. Though ultrasonography is not yet currently regarded as a definitive diagnostic test, the ordering and performance of an ultrasound can aid clinicians' assessment of the patient's symptoms and identify potentially pathological nature of patients' symptoms, or, at the least, rule out other potential diagnoses. In other cases, OB/GYNs reportedly rejected patients' requests for diagnostic laparoscopy, even in cases in which patients had reportedly been suffering for many years.

Performance on non-discriminatory/non-helpful diagnostic testing

When symptoms were appraised by clinicians as potentially pathological, patients reported that clinicians often did order and/or perform various other diagnostic tests. Because these diagnostic testing methods are either not sensitive or specific (eg, blood tests) or are non-discriminatory in diagnosing endometriosis (eg, transvaginal ultrasonography), the results were often normal, potentially falsely leading clinicians to conclude that there was nothing wrong. This finding is also consistent with the systematic review of qualitative studies in the context of endometriosis.

### ESUR consensus MRI for endometriosis: protocol, lexicon, and compartment-based analysis [^113Rf89L]. European Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Endometriosis, defined by the presence of endometrium-like tissue outside the uterus, affects 2–10% of the female population, representing at least 190 million women worldwide. In addition, endometriosis is reported in 50% of women of reproductive age with chronic pelvic pain and or with a history of infertility, but this includes predominantly superficial endometriosis, which is often overlooked or not seen on imaging. In contrast, adnexal endometriosis and deep pelvic endometriosis (DE) have a more aggressive behavior in some women with endometriosis.

In 2017, the first European Society of Urogenital Radiology (ESUR) consensus proposed some recommendations regarding patient preparation and imaging acquisition to start standardizing practice. However, the MRI technique has improved with high-resolution 3D sequences and AI denoising solutions, necessitating a review of protocol guidelines.

Since the previous consensus, several authors have proposed a consensual lexicon and developed different reporting classifications to improve communication between the radiologist and the patient or the radiologist and the surgeon. This is why it is time to change imaging guidelines in endometriosis.

Diagnostic laparoscopy in primary and secondary infertility — rationale: Laparoscopy is typically the final step of a workup for infertility and is used to avoid open surgery. Diagnostic laparoscopy can be used as an adjunct to salpingography to help diagnose causes of infertility. Lesions that may not be seen with salpingography and are viewed better with laparoscopy include endometriosis and adhesions.

Summary

Background

The time between symptoms onset and endometriosis diagnosis is usually long. The negative impacts of delayed endometriosis diagnosis can affect patients and health outcomes.

Methods

We conducted a case-control study using clinical symptoms and epidemiological data extracted from a prospective pre-operative patient questionnaire compared between patients with histologically proven endometriosis and patients with no endometriosis at surgical exploration from 2005 to 2018, in a French referral center. We used the beta coefficients of the significant variables introduced in a multiple regression model to devise a score (score 1), evaluated by the area under the curve (or C-index), with three levels, defined by a score between 1 and ≥ 25: (i) highly specific, identifying correctly the patients without the disease; (ii) highly sensitive, identifying the patients with the disease; and (iii) a level maximizing sensitivity and specificity for the best classification of the whole population. To minimize patient self-evaluation of pain, we devised a second score (score 2) with the same method and levels and scores definition, excluding visual analog scale pain scores, except for dysmenorrhea. These scores were validated on an internal and external population.

Findings

Score 1 had a C-index of 0.81 (95% CI [0.79–0.83]). Results for the three score 1 levels were: ≥ 25: specificity of 91% (95% CI [89–93]); < 11: sensitivity of 91% (95% CI [89–93]); ≥ 18: specificity of 75% (95% CI [72–78]) and sensitivity of 73% (95% CI [70–76]). Score 2 had a C-index of 0.75 (95% CI [73–77]). The three levels of score 2 were: ≥ 24: specificity of 82% (95% CI [80–85]); < 7: sensitivity of 92% (95% CI [90–94]); ≥ 17: specificity of 62% (95% CI [58–65]) and sensitivity of 78% (95% CI [75–81]). The two scores were internally and externally validated.

Interpretation

A score based only on a patient questionnaire could allow identification of a population at high risk of endometriosis. This strategy might help referral to specialized radiologists for a non-surgical endometriosis scan.

### Non-invasive imaging techniques for diagnosis of pelvic deep endometriosis and endometriosis classification systems: an international consensus statement [^114ixyjg]. European Journal of Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

The International Society of Ultrasound in Obstetrics and Gynecology (ISUOG) and International Deep Endometriosis Analysis (IDEA) group, the European Endometriosis League (EEL), the European Society for Gynaecological Endoscopy (ESGE), the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE), the International Society for Gynecologic Endoscopy (ISGE), the American Association of Gynecologic Laparoscopists (AAGL) and the European Society of Urogenital Radiology (ESUR) elected an international, multidisciplinary panel of gynecological surgeons, sonographers and radiologists, including a steering committee, which searched the literature for relevant articles in order to review the literature and provide evidence-based and clinically relevant statements on the use of imaging techniques for non-invasive diagnosis and classification of pelvic deep endometriosis. Preliminary statements were drafted based on review of the relevant literature. Following two rounds of revisions and voting orchestrated by chairs of the participating societies, consensus statements were finalized. A final version of the document was then resubmitted to the society chairs for approval. Twenty statements were drafted, of which 14 reached strong and three moderate agreement after the first voting round. The remaining three statements were discussed by all members of the steering committee and society chairs and rephrased, followed by an additional round of voting. At the conclusion of the process, 14 statements had strong and five statements moderate agreement, with one statement left in equipoise. This consensus work aims to guide clinicians involved in treating women with suspected endometriosis during patient assessment, counseling and planning of surgical treatment strategies. This Consensus Statement should be cited as: 'G. Condous, B. Gerges, I. Thomassin-Naggara, C. Becker, C. Tomassetti, H. Krentel, B.J. van Herendael, M. Malzoni, M. S. Abrao, E. Saridogan, J.

Patient Selection

Diagnosis

Historically, a definitive diagnosis of endometriosis required laparoscopic lesion visualization and excision with histologic confirmation of endometrial gland, endometrial stroma, and/or hemosiderin-laden macrophage presence. However, even in the absence of a definitive diagnosis, many professional society treatment recommendations permit the use of empiric therapy when there is a strong suspicion or clinical evidence of endometriosis. For example, guidelines from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) give a Level B recommendation to empiric therapy with a 3-month course of a GnRH agonist in women with chronic pelvic pain who have undergone an appropriate pretreatment evaluation and in whom oral contraceptives and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have failed, noting the patient should be informed that treatment response does not confirm an endometriosis diagnosis.

The criteria for suspecting endometriosis differ among guidelines, but generally include the presence of pelvic pain symptoms (progressively worsening dysmenorrhea [particularly when severe and unresponsive to NSAIDs and/or hormonal-based therapies], NMPP, and deep dyspareunia), which may be augmented by physical findings (e.g. pelvic tenderness and nodularity on palpation of the uterosacral ligaments and rectovaginal septum), imaging results, and/or cyclical nongynecologic symptoms (dyschezia, dysuria, hematuria and rectal bleeding, diarrhea/irritable bowel syndrome, and shoulder pain). When symptoms are cyclic in nature and progressive over time, endometriosis is by far the most likely clinical diagnosis.

It is increasingly recognized that identification of endometriosis can be achieved with reasonable certainty using nonsurgical methodologies (i.e. a clinical diagnosis), which include evaluation of pelvic pain symptoms, patient history, physical examination findings, and appropriately performed imaging studies. Although there has yet to be identified a replacement test or tests for diagnostic surgery, clinicians with expertise in endometriosis diagnosis and management have suggested that symptoms, patient history, and clinical assessments taken in totality provide a basis for clinical diagnosis.

The benefits of undertaking a clinical diagnosis approach are that it does not require surgery and the attendant risks thereof, utilizes assessment tools that are readily available to most clinicians, and may reduce the delay frequently observed in endometriosis diagnosis. In clinical practice, presumptive diagnosis of endometriosis is often made without laparoscopy or other surgical procedure, and can facilitate early and effective management of patients' symptoms.
