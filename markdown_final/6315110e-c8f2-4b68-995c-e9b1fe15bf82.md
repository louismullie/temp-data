## Question

first step suspected umbilical hernia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the first step in evaluating a suspected umbilical hernia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the initial clinical assessment and triage. Then, I should verify when imaging is indicated and which modality to choose. Next, I will consider special populations such as children, patients with cirrhosis, and those with suspected endometriosis. After that, I need to outline immediate management pathways for reducible versus incarcerated or strangulated hernias. Finally, I will synthesize a concise, stepwise algorithm and ensure each recommendation aligns with guideline-grade evidence and key studies.

> Let me first confirm the foundation: the first step in suspected umbilical hernia is a focused history and physical examination to characterize the defect, reducibility, contents, and signs of complications, because most hernias are diagnosed clinically and this directs urgency and imaging needs [^115BLbep] [^117AxgYu].

> Wait, let me verify the key elements I must document on history: onset and duration, prior episodes of incarceration, prior abdominal surgery, systemic symptoms such as fever, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, and skin changes over the hernia, as well as comorbidities that increase risk like cirrhosis, obesity, or chronic cough, since these factors influence both diagnosis and urgency of management [^115BLbep] [^117ErjcY].

> I will now examine the physical findings I must record: location relative to the umbilicus, defect size, whether the hernia is reducible, presence of erythema or ecchymosis of overlying skin, tenderness, and signs of obstruction or peritonitis, because these findings distinguish simple hernias from complicated ones requiring emergent intervention [^1135xHQE] [^113E8ruW].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about imaging; I should confirm when it is indicated. Imaging is not routinely required for a straightforward, reducible umbilical hernia with a clear exam, but it becomes essential when the diagnosis is uncertain, the hernia is nonreducible, there are signs of complications, the patient is obese with a limited exam, or preoperative planning is needed for complex or recurrent hernias [^1135xHQE] [^117AxgYu].

> Let me think about the best first-line imaging modality. Ultrasound is preferred initially because it is noninvasive, dynamic, avoids radiation, and can assess reducibility and vascularity; in children, ultrasound is the modality of choice, and in adults it can rapidly confirm hernia and detect complications when the exam is equivocal [^1135xHQE] [^notfound] [^117AxgYu].

> But wait, what if ultrasound is nondiagnostic or complications are suspected? In that case, CT of the abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast is the next step because it delineates defect size, contents, obstruction, ischemia, and relationships to adjacent structures; it is the workhorse for complicated hernias and for preoperative planning in complex cases [^117AxgYu] [^116mgPb9] [^1135xHQE].

> I should double-check the role of MRI. MRI is a reasonable alternative when radiation avoidance is prioritized or when soft-tissue detail is needed, such as in pregnancy or complex abdominal wall anatomy, but it is less available emergently and is typically reserved for select scenarios rather than routine first-line imaging [^116mgPb9] [^1135xHQE].

> Next, I should review special populations, starting with children. For asymptomatic pediatric umbilical hernias, the first step is observation until at least 4–5 years because most close spontaneously. Ultrasound is used selectively when the diagnosis is uncertain or to differentiate from epigastric hernia, and early surgical referral is generally unnecessary unless there are concerning features or complications [^115863yq] [^114Bi5PF] [^111fkMUE].

> Let me consider cirrhosis with ascites carefully. Umbilical hernias are common in cirrhosis, and elective repair should be deferred until ascites is medically optimized. If incarceration occurs, emergent surgery carries high morbidity and mortality, so multidisciplinary planning and, in select cases, ultrasound-guided hernia sac paracentesis can facilitate reduction and temporize the need for emergency surgery [^117ErjcY] [^114WKJzU] [^112Uqi17].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought CT would be the universal first step for any suspected umbilical hernia, but that overuses radiation. I should correct that and emphasize ultrasound first in most cases, reserving CT for nondiagnostic studies or suspected complications, which aligns with ACR and surgical guidelines [^116mgPb9].

> I will now examine the immediate management pathway. If the hernia is reducible and the patient is stable, I should arrange outpatient surgical follow-up for elective repair, with counseling on activity restriction and warning signs of incarceration. If the hernia is incarcerated but without signs of strangulation, I should attempt gentle manual reduction with analgesia or sedation and, if successful, observe and arrange urgent repair. If reduction fails or strangulation is suspected, I should proceed to emergent surgical consultation without delay [^1135xHQE] [^113E8ruW].

> Hold on, I should verify how to assess for strangulation at the bedside. Signs include severe pain, overlying skin erythema or dusky discoloration, systemic toxicity, and peritoneal signs. Laboratory markers such as elevated lactate, WBC, and metabolic acidosis support ischemia, but clinical judgment and timely operative intervention are paramount because delays increase the need for bowel resection [^1135xHQE] [^117NRyP4] [^113E8ruW].

> Let me reconsider imaging's role in the acute setting. Even when the diagnosis is clear, CT can help define anatomy and guide operative planning, but it should not delay operative management when strangulation is suspected. In select cases, point-of-care ultrasound can assist with assessing bowel viability and guiding reduction strategies, but this does not replace surgical evaluation [^1135xHQE] [^114X9i2R].

> I should confirm the synthesis into a practical algorithm. First, perform a focused history and physical examination to establish diagnosis and screen for complications; second, if the exam is unequivocally diagnostic and the hernia is reducible, proceed to elective surgical referral without imaging; third, if the diagnosis is uncertain, the hernia is nonreducible, or complications are suspected, obtain ultrasound first and escalate to contrast-enhanced CT if ultrasound is nondiagnostic or complications are confirmed; fourth, tailor imaging choice to special populations, favoring ultrasound in children and MRI when radiation avoidance is critical; fifth, manage emergently if incarceration with strangulation is suspected, prioritizing surgical consultation over imaging delays [^116mgPb9] [^1135xHQE] [^115BLbep].

---

The first step in suspected umbilical hernia is a **focused history and physical examination** to confirm the diagnosis and assess for complications [^1135xHQE]. If the diagnosis is uncertain or complications are suspected, obtain a **bedside ultrasound** as the initial imaging modality [^116mgPb9] [^117AxgYu]. Reserve CT for cases with diagnostic uncertainty, suspected complications, or when ultrasound is inconclusive [^115BLbep]. Immediate surgical consultation is indicated for **incarceration, strangulation, or skin changes** [^1135xHQE] [^117NRyP4].

---

## Clinical history and physical examination

### Clinical history

- **Onset and duration**: Determine when the bulge first appeared and whether it has changed in size or frequency.
- **Symptoms**: Assess for pain, discomfort, nausea, vomiting, constipation, or urinary symptoms [^113E8ruW].
- **Reducibility**: Ask if the bulge can be pushed back into the abdomen and whether it becomes more prominent with coughing, straining, or physical activity.
- **Complications**: Inquire about episodes of incarceration (irreducibility), strangulation (severe pain, skin color changes, systemic symptoms), or infection.
- **Risk factors**: Document obesity, chronic cough, constipation, pregnancy, ascites, or previous abdominal surgery [^117ErjcY].

---

### Physical examination

- **Inspection**: Observe the umbilical region for a visible bulge, skin changes (erythema, cyanosis, ulceration), or signs of infection.
- **Palpation**: Palpate the bulge to determine reducibility, assess the size of the fascial defect, and evaluate tenderness or warmth.
- **Cough impulse**: Have the patient cough or perform a Valsalva maneuver to elicit a cough impulse, indicating herniation.
- **Percussion and auscultation**: Percuss the bulge to differentiate solid from hollow contents; auscultate for bowel sounds if bowel is suspected within the hernia sac [^notfound].

---

## Initial imaging modality: ultrasound

Ultrasound is the **preferred initial imaging modality** for suspected umbilical hernia because it is non-invasive, widely available, and does not involve radiation [^notfound]. It provides real-time visualization of the hernia sac, contents, and reducibility and can accurately identify herniated bowel, omentum, or other intra-abdominal structures [^114X9i2R]. Ultrasound is particularly useful in pediatric patients, pregnant women, and individuals with contraindications to radiation exposure [^115BLbep].

---

### Advantages of ultrasound

- **Non-invasive**: No radiation exposure, making it safe for repeated use.
- **Real-time imaging**: Allows dynamic assessment of hernia reducibility and contents.
- **Cost-effective**: Lower cost compared to CT or MRI.
- **Widely available**: Accessible in most clinical settings, including outpatient clinics and emergency departments [^notfound].

---

### Limitations of ultrasound

Operator dependence and limited visualization in patients with **obesity** can reduce accuracy, and ultrasound may be less effective for deep or complex hernias [^116BwdZT].

---

## Indications for advanced imaging (CT or MRI)

While ultrasound is the initial imaging modality, **CT or MRI** may be indicated in specific clinical scenarios:

- **Diagnostic uncertainty**: If ultrasound is inconclusive or the clinical diagnosis remains uncertain.
- **Suspected complications**: Incarceration, strangulation, bowel obstruction, or infection.
- **Complex hernias**: Large or recurrent hernias requiring detailed anatomical assessment.
- **Preoperative planning**: Detailed evaluation of hernia size, contents, and relationship to adjacent structures [^117AxgYu].

---

CT provides excellent anatomical detail and is particularly useful in acute settings, whereas MRI is preferred for detailed soft-tissue evaluation without radiation exposure, especially in pediatric or pregnant patients [^115BLbep].

---

## Clinical decision-making and management

Based on the initial clinical assessment and imaging findings, management decisions include:

- **Observation**: Asymptomatic, reducible hernias without complications may be observed with regular follow-up [^113E8ruW].
- **Elective surgical repair**: Symptomatic hernias or those causing cosmetic concerns may be repaired electively [^112MS1tj].
- **Emergency surgical intervention**: Incarcerated, strangulated, or infected hernias require immediate surgical consultation and intervention [^1135xHQE] [^117GuhST].

## Summary of first step in suspected umbilical hernia

1. Clinical history and physical examination
2. Bedside ultrasound (initial imaging modality)
3. Advanced imaging (CT or MRI) if indicated
4. Clinical decision-making and management

---

The first step in suspected umbilical hernia is a **focused history and physical examination**, followed by **ultrasound as the initial imaging modality**. CT or MRI is reserved for diagnostic uncertainty or suspected complications. Immediate surgical consultation is indicated for **incarceration, strangulation, or infection** [^1135xHQE].

### Association of sociodemographic factors with adherence to age-specific guidelines for asymptomatic umbilical hernia repair in children [^114PAzKX]. JAMA Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Importance

Current guidelines recommend delaying repair of asymptomatic umbilical hernia in children until after age 4 to 5 years to allow for spontaneous closure.

Objective

To examine the association of sociodemographic factors with adherence to age-specific guidelines for asymptomatic umbilical hernia repair in children.

Design, Setting, and Participants

In this multicenter retrospective cohort study, children 17 years and younger who underwent umbilical hernia repair from January 2013 to June 2018 at 47 freestanding children's hospitals participating in the Pediatric Health Information System database were eligible for study inclusion. Children who underwent multiple procedures, repair of recurrent hernias, or had missing sociodemographic data were excluded.

Exposures

Early umbilical hernia repair was defined as repair at 3 years or younger. Emergent or urgent presentation was defined as repair performed during the same encounter or within 2 weeks of an emergency department visit, respectively. Patients were categorized by sex, race/ethnicity, insurance type, income quintile, and presence of complex chronic conditions.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Multivariable mixed-effects logistic regression was used to evaluate the association of sociodemographic factors with the odds of early repair after adjusting for emergent or urgent presentation and hospital-level effects.

Results

Of the 25 877 included children, 13 817 (53.4%) were female, 14 143 (54.7%) had public insurance, and the median (interquartile range) age was 5.0 (3.0–6.0) years. Following adjustment, increased odds of early repair was associated with public insurance (public vs commercial insurance: odds ratio [OR], 1.46; 95% CI, 1.36–1.56; P < .001), lower income (lowest vs highest income quintile: OR, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.33–1.65; P < .001), and female sex (female vs male sex: OR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.13–1.27; P < .001). Children with public insurance in the lowest income quintile had 2.2-fold increased odds of early repair compared with children with commercial insurance in the highest income quintile (OR, 2.15; 95% CI, 1.93–2.40; P < .001). Sociodemographic factors were not associated with increased odds of early repair in the subgroup of children who underwent early repair following emergent or urgent presentation.

Conclusions and Relevance

Public insurance, lower income, and female sex are independently associated with repair of asymptomatic umbilical hernias in children earlier than recommended by current guidelines. These children may be at greater risk of undergoing repair of umbilical hernias that may spontaneously close with further observation.

### Standard outpatient re-evaluation for patients not admitted to the hospital after emergency department evaluation for acute abdominal pain [^114pBNna]. World Journal of Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

The final diagnoses for the 500 patients that had a standard re-evaluation are given in Table 2. The average follow-up was 12 days (range: 1–275 days), but most of the patients (46.2%) could be discharged from follow-up after just one outpatient visit.

Table 2
The final diagnoses for 500 patients who were not admitted to the hospital but who underwent standard outpatient re-evaluation after presentation at the emergency department for acute abdominal pain

NOS not otherwise specified

For 148 patients (29.6%) the final diagnosis (FD) was different from the initial clinical diagnosis (D1) or the combined diagnosis (CD1) after additional radiological imaging on the day of first evaluation (Table 3). Eighty-five (17.0%) patients had a change in management, 20 of which (4.0%) were considered major (Table 4). A change in management was regarded as major if the clinical strategy changed to a surgical procedure when the initial strategy was conservative. Seventeen patients underwent operation after re-evaluation for presumed appendicitis (1 negative appendectomy), one for an incarcerated umbilical hernia, another for an incarcerated ventral hernia; one patient underwent laparotomy for intestinal obstruction due to adhesions.

### Predictors of spontaneous resolution of umbilical hernia in children [^114vNHhC]. World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Premature babies were 80% less likely to have a spontaneous resolution compared with non-premature babies in our study. This may be due to incomplete closure of the fascia of the umbilical ring, through which abdominal contents may protrude. The umbilical ring undergoes spontaneous closure through the growth of rectus muscles and fusion of the fascial layers after separation of umbilical cord. The failure or delay in process can lead to the umbilical hernia formation.

As supported by Halleran and colleagues, we surmised that unplanned hospital visits among families of young children (< 4 years) could be diverted if patients with asymptomatic umbilical hernia were followed up by their family physicians conservatively. This might decrease the waiting time or eliminate the need for pediatric surgeon consultation in-hospitals because active patient monitoring by family physicians via conservative treatment strategies could potentially reduce unintended, adverse clinical outcomes.

The main limitation of this study was the retrospective design, which does not permit data collection on additional variables that could influence defect size and rates of recurrence or postoperative complications. Moreover, there were considerable data missing on defect size. As such, we were unable to provide a recommendation for a clinical cut-off for defect size in non-resolution cases. This large and robust sample is only reflective of one institution's experience, in children aged 0–18 years and thus cannot be generalized to children in other institutions. Overall, our findings contribute to a field that has received minimal empirical attention.

Strengths of this study include identifying factors for spontaneous resolution of umbilical hernia. This information can help family physicians at CHEO when deciding which patients will have higher chances of spontaneous resolution and thus, which patients will benefit from an earlier surgical intervention or if it is recommended to be followed conservatively. Another advantage is the thorough collection of data regarding the progress of patients from the time of first admission until discharge, validated by the study team. The data collected therefore provide an accurate representation of clinical indicators and management of umbilical hernia at one Canadian Hospital.

### European hernia society guidelines on management of rectus diastasis [^112NaKxs]. The British Journal of Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

KQ8 What is the optimal treatment of rectus diastasis with concomitant umbilical or epigastric hernias?

Statement: Mesh-based repair is recommended according to the European Hernia Society and Americas Hernia Society Guidelines for Treatment of Umbilical and Epigastric Hernias. Plication of the anterior rectus sheath may be sufficient to repair the smallest (less than 1 cm) umbilical or epigastric hernias. Other approaches have been reported. The endoscopic subcutaneous dissection followed by linea alba plication with an onlay mesh was the most reported technique.

Recommendation: A mesh-based repair of RD with concomitant midline hernias is suggested. Plication of the linea alba may be sufficient to repair a diastasis associated with small (less than 1 cm) umbilical/epigastric hernias.

Quality of evidence: Low

Strength of recommendation: Weak

KQ9 Is there a role for specific postoperative management of RD repair?

Statement: Abdominal binders appear to aid mobilization, and reduce postoperative pain and psychological stress. They have no effect on seroma formation or pulmonary function. No specific postoperative rehabilitation programme is used worldwide.

Recommendation: As a clinical expertise guidance, the use of an abdominal binder in the postoperative period can be suggested. The noted advantages of reduced pain, enhanced mobilization, and their perceived psychological support after surgery, make their contribution modest but of value. No specific postoperative rehabilitation programme can be recommended.

Quality of evidence: Very low

Strength of recommendation: Weak

### Epigastric hernias in children and the use of ultrasound in its diagnosis [^111fkMUE]. World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

At the opposite site of the spectrum, there are those patients with small fascial defects: due to the difficulty of palpating them, it has been advised to regularly mark the site of the hernia preoperatively, as it may be difficult to identify it in the supine and relaxed patient. We have been able to establish this association using correlation analyses and indeed found that small fascial defects are much less likely to be found during clinical examination. The palpable fascial defect is not a prerequisite to make the diagnosis: the diagnosis is mainly established by the presence of a (para)median swelling in physical examination. The aspect of the palpable fascial defect is relevant because the swelling will often disappear in the operating room, but this can be addressed by preoperative marking of the localization of the swelling before induction of anesthesia. Consequently, the use of ultrasound in pediatric epigastric hernia has been debated: some considered it to be exceptional, as the clinical examination will almost always establish the diagnosis, while others assumed ultrasound to be useful to establish the diagnosis because in the majority of cases, the fascial defect was not detected without ultrasound. Ultrasound has been a valuable tool in the evaluation of abdominal wall hernias for decades, and due to its high sensitivity and specificity, it may be advantageous when the clinical examination is equivocal. The most relevant among these is the differentiation between umbilical hernias and supraumbilical hernias: ideally, epigastric hernia could easily be discerned from umbilical hernias due to a distance to the navel as exemplified by Tinawi and Stringeror due to a characteristic U shape of the umbilicus being pushed downward by the epigastric hernia as shown by Shastri and Gilmer. If the clinical examination alone could not allow differentiation between these two types of hernia, ultrasound would most likely do so. This differentiation in equivocal cases is also of clinical relevance, as the management differs: while epigastric hernias are usually scheduled for elective repair once diagnosed, watchful waiting for spontaneous closure for asymptomatic umbilical hernia until the age of 4 years has been recommended by a systematic review. In addition, in umbilical hernias, the defect size is associated with the odds of spontaneous closure, with larger defects being less likely to close spontaneously, so the information gained by ultrasound could even be of relevance for counseling the patient's family if an umbilical and not an epigastric hernia is diagnosed. However, ultrasound should not be part of the routine care for epigastric hernia, as it is recommended to refer patients to secondary pediatric surgical care anyway if an epigastric hernia is suspected.

Indication for surgery

Indications for treatment: dependence on size of defect or hernia sac, hernia type, symptoms, and age

Thomas Simon

A systematic search was performed in PubMed, Medline, the Cochrane Library, and the Study Register, as well as a search of relevant journals and reference lists including publications until 6 June 2012. The following search terms were used in the search strategy: "operation" AND "watchful waiting" AND ("Hernia" [Mesh]) OR "Hernia; Abdominal" [Mesh] OR "Hernia; Ventral" [Mesh] OR "Hernia; Umbilical" [Mesh] OR ("Abdominal wall hernias") OR ("ventral hernia") OR ("epigastric hernia") OR ("incisional hernia") AND (randomized controlled trial[pt] OR controlled clinical trial[pt]). The search produced 462 hits including inguinal hernias. Of the 42 relevant papers found, 28 were selected for this analysis. The only two level 1b trials addressed inguinal hernias and were included with intention to discuss the existing evidence in a related field. Regarding data addressing ventral and incisional hernias, only one level 3 study and 15 level 4 uncontrolled studies were found.

Statements

Recommendations

No precise data on the incidence and prevalence of ventral and incisional hernias are available. An epidemiologic study showed an increasing proportion of midline abdominal wall hernias, with a relative frequency of 19% for umbilical/par umbilical hernias, 8.6% for epigastric hernias, and 4.8% for incisional hernias [78]. The incidence for incisional hernia is 10–20% [79, 80], making it one of the most common surgical complication after laparotomy.

Ventral and incisional hernias are treated with surgery to relieve symptoms (pain and discomfort), to prevent complications (strangulation, respiratory dysfunction, or skin problems), or to resolve acute complications (incarceration and strangulation) [95].

### Repair of umbilical and epigastric hernias [^111Xh1eZ]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Umbilical and epigastric hernias are primary midline defects that are present in up to 50% of the population. In the United States, only about 1% of the population carries this specific diagnosis, and only about 11% of these are repaired. Repair is aimed at symptoms relief or prevention, and the patient's goals and expectations should be explicitly identified and aligned with the health care team. This article details some relevant and interesting anatomic issues, reviews existing data, and highlights some common and important surgical techniques. Emphasis is placed on a patient-centered approach to the repair of umbilical and epigastric hernias.

### AGA clinical practice update on surgical risk assessment and perioperative management in cirrhosis: expert review [^112GiR7L]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2019). High credibility.

Abdominal wall hernia repair in cirrhosis — control of ascites is key to successful hernia repair, and because the ascites inevitably recurs quickly, a single large-volume paracentesis before a surgical procedure does not provide adequate preoperative control of ascites. Medical control of clinically apparent ascites with diuretics before a surgical hernia repair is required in a patient with decompensated cirrhosis to prevent recurrent ascites postoperatively, and selected surgical candidates may benefit from preemptive placement of a TIPS to control ascites before surgery. Efforts should be undertaken to avoid recurrent ascites in the postoperative period and may include frequent postoperative paracentesis and careful diuretic therapy while attempting to avoid renal injury; in selected patients transient pigtail catheter drainage of ascites postoperatively may prevent pressure on the hernia repair. Both the MELD score and the Child-Pugh class combined with the ASA class have been advocated for hernia surgery risk stratification, but neither appears to be optimal in all cases. A single-center prospective case series without controls reported on patients listed for liver transplantation who presented for elective umbilical hernia repair; Thirty patients eventually underwent elective surgery, and most had Child-Pugh class B or C cirrhosis, with a median MELD score of 12. Two patients had prolonged hospital stays due to complications, but the remainder did not experience a direct surgical complication, and the authors concluded that elective umbilical hernia repair is preferable to emergency repair in patients with cirrhosis and ascites. The lack of controls in this series makes broad conclusions difficult and the frequency of emergency incarceration in patients with cirrhosis with a stable abdominal hernia is unknown, and surgical and medical teams should determine the safety and risk-benefit ratio of elective hernia surgery carefully in this population.

### Infected urachal cyst initially misdiagnosed as an incarcerated umbilical hernia [^112aRLXF]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Urachal abnormalities are a rare cause of lower abdominal pain. They are often initially mistaken for more common causes of lower abdominal pain, and the diagnosis is usually made during evaluation for one of these more common conditions.

Case Report

We report a case of a painful periumbilical mass ultimately diagnosed as an infected urachal cyst. Although the cyst was evident sonographically, it was misidentified as an umbilical hernia, and the correct diagnosis was not made until the patient underwent computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis before surgery.

Conclusion

Emergency physicians should consider urachal disease in patients presenting with lower abdominal pain and should also be familiar with both the clinical and radiologic findings characteristic of this disease.

### Update of the international herniaSurge guidelines for groin hernia management [^114MWLAA]. BJS Open (2023). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for inguinal hernia, more specifically with respect to evaluation for bowel strangulation, HSG 2023 guidelines recommend to consider assessing clinical symptoms in combination with biochemical parameters for the assessment of potential bowel ischemia in patients with acutely symptomatic inguinal hernia, as biochemical parameters alone have low specificity.

Fetal abdomen and pelvis — The abdomen is evaluated primarily in the axial plane at 3 levels: stomach, kidneys, and bladder; the stomach should be identified on the left and the liver on the right, the umbilical cord insertion into the anterior abdominal wall should be demonstrated, and power or color Doppler may be used to show the umbilical arteries on each side of the fetal bladder, within which fluid should be seen; the fetal kidneys may be identified most easily on the coronal view using the central hypoechoic renal pelvis as a landmark, and power or color Doppler imaging of the renal arteries is recommended if visualization is inadequate; a physiologic herniation of bowel into the base of the umbilical cord may be seen before 13 weeks' gestation and is a normal finding.

### If laparoscopic technique can be used for treatment of acutely incarcerated / strangulated inguinal hernia? [^1171J3cf]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

After hernia reduction, the most important step is to assess the vitality of the hernia contents. Our result revealed that the most frequently encountered content in incarcerated hernia was small intestine. If a definite diagnosis cannot be immediately made, TAPP repair can be performed first. Surgery can provide sufficient observation time to make a decision about bowel resection. In some cases, the color of suspected ischemic bowel may recover to normal after hernia repair, thus avoiding unnecessary bowel resection. In our study, bowel resection was only performed in two patients. Unnecessary bowel resections were avoided in nine patients because the color of the incarcerated bowel recovered to normal after the TAPP procedure. Similar results have been reported in other previously published studies.

Laparoscopy provides a good view of the internal abdominal cavity, making it a useful diagnostic technique, especially for those with hernia contents that reduced spontaneously preoperatively. Once the potentially necrotic bowel has spontaneously reduced into the abdominal cavity, the patient may develop bowel perforation, abdominal infection, or even life-threatening sepsis. We can detect the reduced bowel via laparoscopy to avoid these problems. Furthermore, a contralateral inguinal hernia can be diagnosed and repaired simultaneously via laparoscopy.

The conversion rate is one of the criteria used to evaluate the feasibility of the laparoscopic technique. No conversion occurred in our study, suggesting that TAPP repair is feasible for treatment of acutely incarcerated/strangulated inguinal hernias. Other previously published papers also support our result. Bowel distension was recognized as the reason for conversion. No conversion occurred in our study. The reasons were as follows: first, our patients were strictly selected. Patients with severe bowel distension or patients who had signs of bowel gangrene with abdominal wall infection or peritonitis were excluded; second, all procedures must be performed with great care. Blind traction was forbidden to prevent iatrogenic bleeding or bowel injury. Third, the hernia ring must be cut in patients with severe incarceration. This additional procedure can quickly release the incarceration, resulting in an easy hernia reduction. Furthermore, the surgeon's ability will determine whether the laparoscopic technique can be successfully performed in emergency cases because this technique involves a long learning curve. TAPP repair are recommended to be performed by senior surgeons who have gained sufficient experience in laparoscopic techniques.

### Adult abdominal hernias [^115BLbep]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2014). Low credibility.

Educational Objectives and Key Points. 1. Given that abdominal hernias are a frequent imaging finding, radiologists not only are required to interpret the appearances of abdominal hernias but also should be comfortable with identifying associated complications and postrepair findings. 2. CT is the imaging modality of choice for the assessment of a known adult abdominal hernia in both elective and acute circumstances because of rapid acquisition, capability of multiplanar reconstruction, good spatial resolution, and anatomic depiction with excellent sensitivity for most complications. 3. Ultrasound is useful for adult groin assessment and is the imaging modality of choice for pediatric abdominal wall hernia assessment, whereas MRI is beneficial when there is reasonable concern that a patient's symptoms could be attributable to a hernia or a musculoskeletal source. 4. Fluoroscopic herniography is a sensitive radiologic investigation for patients with groin pain in whom a hernia is suspected but in whom a hernia cannot be identified at physical examination. 5. The diagnosis of an internal hernia not only is a challenging clinical diagnosis but also can be difficult to diagnose with imaging: Closed-loop small-bowel obstruction and abnormally located bowel loops relative to normally located small bowel or colon should prompt assessment for an internal hernia.

### Spontaneous bowel evisceration through umbilical hernia in an adult non-cirrhotic patient [^117DrsYa]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

Background

An umbilical hernia (UH) is a ventral midline hernia located at or near the umbilicus, from 3 cm above to 3 cm below the umbilicus, according to the classification of the European Hernia Society. Being the second most common hernia in adulthood, behind only inguinal hernias, UH is acquired, rather than congenital, in approximately 90% of adult patients. One of its prominent risk factors is an acute or chronic increase in intra-abdominal pressure, such as persistent ascites. In the general population, UH has a prevalence of approximately 2%, while in cirrhotic patients with persistent ascites, it occurs in around 20% of the cases, or even up to 40% in large-volume ascites. As an extremely rare occurrence, though more frequent in cirrhotic patients with ascites, a sudden increase in intra-abdominal pressure (eg, coughing, straining, physical exercise, etc.) can rupture the UH sac, with leakage of ascites through a skin lesion, the so-called Flood Syndrome, or, in the worst-case scenario, with spontaneous bowel evisceration (SBE). Ascites develops in over half of patients with cirrhosis and is indicative of advanced hepatic decompensation, making it a poor prognostic indicator, and therefore accounting for even higher mortality rates in such cases. Surgery remains the only definitive treatment for UH, although there is no clear consensus on the best approach. Management of SBE, a life-threatening complication, necessitates prompt surgical intervention to prevent bowel ischemia, perforation and sepsis. A very uncommon event with only a handful of documented patients, we present a case of SBE through an UH in a non-cirrhotic adult patient.

### Point-of-care ultrasonography for hernia reduction: a case of incarcerated umbilical hernia [^114X9i2R]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Manual reduction of an incarcerated hernia is used to avoid emergency surgery, which comes with risks of complications and death, especially in patients with severe comorbidities. However, there are no established procedures for hernia reduction.

Case Report

We present the case of an 82-year-old man with refractory ascites due to nephrotic syndrome and chronic heart failure who developed an incarcerated umbilical hernia. Color Doppler ultrasonography allowed us to detect clearly visible blood-flow signals in the incarcerated bowel and rule out necrosis, which is a contraindication for reduction. Several attempts at manual reduction failed; ultrasonography-guided reduction revealed that fluid collection within the hernia sac was blocking the manual pressure directly on the incarcerated bowel toward the hernia orifice. After sac paracentesis (draining the fluid from the sac), the incarcerated bowel became palpable, leading to a successful reduction. Four days later, once the patient was in a stable condition, an elective surgery was performed to prevent the recurrence of incarceration. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? We believe that this is a useful report on the use of point-of-care ultrasonography for incarcerated hernia from the initial assessment of bowel viability to reasonable hernia reduction through hernia sac paracentesis according to real-time observation. An approach based on visualization by ultrasonography, and not on the operator's experience, would be rational, and we believe that this approach will be feasible for emergency physicians, who are responsible for the initial treatment of incarcerated ventral hernia.

### Surgical management of umbilical endometrioma within an umbilical hernia [^114Gcbug]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

A nulliparous woman in her 40s is referred to gynaecological oncology secondary to umbilical pain and bleeding with menses. Examination revealed a blood-filled cystic mass within an umbilical hernia consistent with umbilical endometrioma. The patient exhausted medical management options, then pursued surgical management via umbilectomy, excision of umbilical endometriosis, lysis of adhesions and umbilical hernia repair. Surgical pathology revealed cystic endometriosis within a hernia sac. Postoperative course was complicated by a surgical site infection, which resolved with antibiotic treatment and ultrasound-guided percutaneous drainage. Few theories attempt to explain the pathogenesis of umbilical endometriosis. Medical management has not been well studied but may prove to be an effective first-line adjuvant strategy. Surgical management is reported to have a low-recurrence rate. Many techniques have been described for umbilical reconstruction, but a superior surgical technique has yet to be identified. The case presented discusses the management of a secondary endometrioma in an umbilical hernia.

### Guidelines for laparoscopic treatment of ventral and incisional abdominal wall hernias (International Endohernia Society (IEHS)-part 1 [^117AxgYu]. Surgical Endoscopy (2014). Medium credibility.

C. Diagnosis — Guideline 4 states that while most ventral hernias are easily diagnosed based on clinical exam, a preoperative abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan or ultrasound may be considered for select patients with suspected ventral hernias to confirm the diagnosis or to aid the surgeon with preoperative planning (Moderate quality, strong recommendation). Diagnosis is typically made during the history and physical examination, but imaging can detect occult or recurrent hernias and assist planning: in a retrospective review of 146 consecutive LVHR's, 48% of patients had occult defects not detected on preoperative physical exam; in one study, recurrence diagnosis after mesh repair was correct 88% on physical exam versus 98% on CT; and dynamic abdominal sonography for ventral hernia diagnosis demonstrated sensitivity 98% and specificity 88%, with PPV 91% and NPV 97%, identifying hernias in a few more patients than CT. Preoperative CT is also helpful in defining abdominal wall anatomy in non-midline hernias and identifying posterior abdominal wall defects, and it accurately assesses relationships to adjacent structures and defect size to support surgical planning.

### 5 mm versus 10 mm umbilical port during laparoscopic cholecystectomy: do outcomes justify broader use in obese patients? A randomized controlled trial [^114rgxXb]. Surgical Endoscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

Postoperative pain management and follow up

All patients were placed on standard and flexible protocol for postoperative pain control during the first 24 h postoperative consisting of 12-hourly intravenous administration of 30 mg ketorolac which could be increased to 8-hourly dose upon patient request. Should further analgesia be required beside ketorolac, an intravenous bolus dose of 1 g paracetamol was provided.

Postoperative pain was assessed and recorded by the same surgeon at 2-, 6-, 12-, and 24-h intervals during the first 24 h postoperative using visual analogue scale (VAS) ranging from 0 to 10 with 0 for no pain and 10 for the worst imaginable pain perceived.

All patients were planned for discharge 24 h after surgery provided that they tolerated pain and oral intake. First follow-up visit was scheduled on postoperative day 4 for physical assessment and wound dressing (Supplemental Fig. 1C and D). Port-site specific pain score was also assessed during the first visit. Second follow-up visit was scheduled on postoperative day 7. The duration of postoperative analgesic requirement at home was recorded as well as the time required by patients to return to their normal daily activities/work. A minimum follow-up period of 1 year was planned for all patients to assess for the incidence of PSH. Accordingly, subsequent follow-up visits were scheduled at 1-, 3-, 6-, and 12-months postoperative. When suspected, PSH was initially assessed by clinical examination and focused abdominal wall ultrasonography. If the hernia was difficult to appreciate clinically and/or the ultrasound report was inconclusive, computed abdominal tomography was performed. During the whole follow-up period, unplanned visits were resorted to whenever surgical complications requiring further care were encountered. Postoperative complications were recorded and reported using the Clavien–Dindo classification.

Patient and surgical team satisfaction

A 5-point Likert scale survey model was used to gather patient and surgical team satisfaction. Patient satisfaction focused on umbilical port wound size, associated pain, wound complications, and cosmetic outcome. They were recorded at 1-, 3-month, and 6-month postoperative and the mean reading was taken. Surgical team satisfaction addressed the team's experience with the use of 5 mm vs 10 mm umbilical port and telescope with regards to the visual field, image quality in terms of brightness, resolution, and accuracy of fine anatomic details. The ease of navigating the optical system by the assistant surgeon in obese patients was also assessed.

### Fetal anterior abdominal wall defects: prenatal imaging by magnetic resonance imaging [^113sexDM]. Pediatric Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Abdominal wall defects range from the mild umbilical cord hernia to the highly complex limb-body wall syndrome. The most common defects are gastroschisis and omphalocele, and the rarer ones include the exstrophy complex, pentalogy of Cantrell and limb-body wall syndrome. Although all have a common feature of viscera herniation through a defect in the anterior body wall, their imaging features and, more important, postnatal management, differ widely. Correct diagnosis of each entity is imperative in order to achieve appropriate and accurate prenatal counseling and postnatal management. In this paper, we discuss fetal abdominal wall defects and present diagnostic pearls to aid with diagnosis.

### Midline incisional hernia guidelines: the European hernia society [^116BwdZT]. The British Journal of Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Summary of Findings for Good Practice Statement B

Good Practice Statement B was developed as a result of consultation amongst experts from the guidelines panel and generation of expert evidence.

All members of the group agreed they would use cross-sectional imaging for the majority of incisional hernia cases, and that the need for cross-sectional imaging increases with the size and complexity of the hernia. It was agreed that young patients with small incisional hernias (such as small trocar-site hernias) may not require imaging. Factors likely to affect the need for imaging include the size of the hernia, the complexity of the hernia (loss of domain and multiple previous surgeries), or the suspicion or diagnosis of other pathologies of interest (for example malignancy). The expert evidence suggested that cross-sectional imaging was required to better understand the anatomy of the hernia, assess possible fascial closure, visualize the quality and degree of retraction of the rectus muscles, and provide optimal information for surgical planning. It was suggested that ultrasound lacks the specific detail or accuracy required to image incisional hernias.

Whilst the expert evidence suggested the use of CT, MRI was also recognized as an alternative. CT may be easier to access, with easier ability for surgeons to interpret images. MRI should, however, be considered in cases where radiation exposure is of concern.

Key Question 3: Is it possible to predict from imaging whether the fascial closure will be possible?

Recommendation A: The guidelines panel suggests that it is not possible to accurately predict with CT whether the fascial defect can be closed without myofascial release (component separation) or peritoneal flap technique (conditional recommendation, very low certainty evidence).

Good Practice Statement B: For patients with a midline incisional hernia, it is likely that the fascia will not be able to be closed without myofascial release if on preoperative CT any of the following apply: the defect width is over 8 cm; the area of the hernia is over 164 cm²; the rectus/defect ratio is less than 1.34; or the component separation index (CSI) is over 0.146. For hernias approaching or above these measures, the guidelines panel suggests that only surgeons who are competent in advanced techniques such as component separation or peritoneal flap should perform surgery.

### Management of asymptomatic pediatric umbilical hernias: a systematic review [^114Bi5PF]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Uncomplicated pediatric umbilical hernias are common and most close spontaneously. No formal practice guidelines exist regarding the optimal timing and indications for repair. The objective of this review is to examine the existing literature on the natural history of pediatric umbilical hernias, known complications of repair and non-operative approaches, and management recommendations.

Study Design

A systematic literature search was performed to identify publications relating to pediatric umbilical hernias. Inclusion criteria comprised studies addressing recommendations for optimal timing of repair, evidence examining complications from hernias not operatively repaired, and research exploring the likelihood of pediatric umbilical hernias to close spontaneously. In addition, the websites of all pediatric hospitals in the United States were examined for recommendations on operative timing.

Results

A total of 787 manuscripts were reviewed, and 28 met criteria for inclusion in the analysis. Studies examined the likelihood of spontaneous closure based on child's age and size of hernia defect, complications of unrepaired umbilical hernias including incarceration, strangulation and evisceration based on child's age and size of defect, incidence of postoperative complications and current recommendations for timing of repair. In addition, 63 (27.5%) of the United States pediatric hospital websites published a wide range of management recommendations.

Conclusion

Despite the high prevalence of pediatric umbilical hernias, there is a paucity of high quality data to guide management. The literature does suggest that expectant management of asymptomatic hernias until age 4–5years, regardless of size of hernia defect, is both safe and the standard practice of many pediatric hospitals.

### Abdominal hernia… [^113E8ruW]. JAMA Network (2011). Excellent credibility.

The first symptom of a hernia is usually a small bulging under the skin that is generally painless but may produce discomfort and get larger during strenuous activities or coughing. At this stage, the hernia is reducible because its contents can be pushed back into the abdomen. However, if the hernia grows, it may become incarcerated. If blood stops flowing through an incarcerated bowel, this results in strangulation, which is accompanied by pain, often with nausea, vomiting, or constipation. A hernia may result in entrapment of other organs or nerves, producing constipation or problems with urination or sexual function. A strangulated hernia is a surgical emergency because part of the bowel may become necrotic, resulting in life-threatening peritonitis needing surgical removal of part of the bowel.

If you have a hernia and significant abdominal pain, pain over the hernia, or nausea or vomiting, you should seek medical care immediately. Treatment Initial treatment of a minor hernia includes avoiding heavy lifting and strenuous exercises and, sometimes, wearing a support. It used to be thought that all hernias should be repaired. However, recent evidence suggests that repair should be performed only if significant discomfort or pain is associated with the hernia. The operation to repair a hernia is called a herniorrhaphy. When the gap is large, a plastic mesh may be used for reinforcement of muscles of the abdominal wall. Use of mesh reduces the risk of the hernia recurring, but the mesh material can become infected.

In some cases, hernia repairs may be performed laparoscopically, although this approach has not been shown to be better than traditional open operations.

Surgical repair of primary umbilical and epigastric hernias are among the most common abdominal operations in the world. The hernia defects range from small (< 1 cm) to large and complex even in the absence of prior incision or repair. Mesh has generally been shown to decrease recurrence rates, and its use and location of placement should be individualized for each patient. Open, laparoscopic, and robotic approaches provide unique considerations for the technical aspects of primary repair with or without mesh augmentation.

### Association between age and umbilical hernia repair outcomes in children: a multistate population-based cohort study [^116F2CgY]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate whether patient age or other sociodemographic and clinical characteristics are associated with recurrence or unplanned related hospital revisits after pediatric umbilical hernia repair.

Study Design

We performed a retrospective cohort study using the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project State Inpatient, Emergency Department, and Ambulatory Surgery and Services Databases of 7 states. Pediatric umbilical hernia repairs performed at any hospital or surgery center in 2010–2014 were included. Hernia recurrences and occurrences of unplanned and related hospital revisits within 30 days were evaluated.

Results

Of 9809 included patients, 52.0% were female and 50.5% were black. The 3-year hernia recurrence rate was 0.57% (95% CI 0.42, 0.73). In multivariable analysis, the recurrence rate was higher in children < 4 years of age than in children 4–10 years of age (hazard ratio [HR] 1.93, 95% CI 1.09, 3.44). Unplanned related hospital revisits within 30 days occurred in 2.5% of patients. Patient characteristics associated with the risk of an unplanned related hospital revisit included age < 4 years (HR 2.17, 95% CI 1.70, 2.77) or > 10 years (HR 2.11, 95% CI 1.46, 3.05), public insurance (HR 2.10, 95% CI 1.58, 2.79), asthma (HR 1.74, 95% CI 1.32, 2.29), and initial presentation to the emergency department (HR 2.46, 95% CI 1.08, 5.61).

Conclusions

Rates of recurrence and unplanned related hospital revisits following pediatric umbilical hernia repair are higher in children younger than 4 years of age. These findings support delaying the repair of asymptomatic umbilical hernia in children until 4 years of age.

### Epigastric hernias in children and the use of ultrasound in its diagnosis [^112Gz4pz]. World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Patients and methods

We retrospectively included all patients below 18 years of age diagnosed with epigastric hernias in the two participating tertiary pediatric surgical departments from 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2020. The available data were screened for misclassified umbilical or incisional hernias, but none were identified. Patients were identified via the specific diagnosis codes according to the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Health Related Problems in the German Modification for an epigastric hernia (K43.60/K43.70/K43.90). Data extraction with anonymization at the source was carried out by specifically trained chart abstractors using a prespecified data extraction chart, which was occasionally cross-checked to ensure the quality of extracted data as recommended elsewhere. We collected information on age, sex, body weight and height, symptoms on presentation, clinical findings, defect size, the preoperative use of ultrasound for diagnosis, and operation times. As there are no clear distinctions in the literature of what accounts for a periumbilical, supraumbilical and an epigastric hernia, we used the following definitions: periumbilical hernias were those immediately adjacent to the umbilical ring but were excluded from the analysis because they frequently occur in association with umbilical hernias. Supraumbilical herniaswere those epigastric hernias that were located up to 3 cm rostral to the umbilicus because anatomical studies have shown that the linea alba may have different properties there compared with more rostral partsand are clinically thought to be different from umbilical hernias. All more rostrally located epigastric hernias were considered true epigastric hernias. Ultrasound examinations were ordered at the discretion of the treating surgeon in both centers. All ultrasound examinations of epigastric hernias were conducted by board-certified pediatric radiologists in a standardized fashion. Open repairs, illustrated elsewhere, were usually performed via a transverse incision, in some cases with larger hernias via a longitudinal incision, located directly above the preoperatively marked hernia. Subcutaneous tissue was transected using electrocautery until the hernia was reached and exposed circumferentially. Following manual reduction of the hernia or if it was unsuccessful, the herniated fat was ligated and divided, and the fascia was closed using simple interrupted sutures. Available fascial defect sizes were measured intraoperatively and taken from the operation notes. The laparoscopic approach used in this report has been described in detail elsewhere. Statistical analysis was conducted using R(V.3.5.3) with its generic stats4 package. Differences in medians of numeric variables were compared via Mood's test, and correlation analyses used point-biserial correlation from the correlation package(V.0.8.0). The normality of the data was checked via the Jarque-Bera test from the tseries package (V.0.10–52)supported by visual analysis of QQ plots. Homogeneity of variance between groups was tested via Levene's test using the car package (V.3.0–7). Symptoms and results of the clinical examination, as dichotomous variables, were compared between males and females using Barnard's testprovided in the Barnard package(V.1.8) as described elsewhere. In the jurisdiction of our ethics committees, retrospective analyses of routine clinical data with anonymization at the source are waived from institutional review board approval.

### Avoid referring most children with umbilical hernias to a pediatric… [^115863yq]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

Patients with umbilical hernias may safely be observed until at least age four years; at that point, pediatric surgical consultation is recommended to discuss surgical repair option. Special consideration for earlier consultation can be given in cases of parental concern. Umbilical hernias, resulting from failure of complete closure of the umbilical ring after birth, affect up to 25% of newborns. Unlike inguinal hernias, or umbilical hernias in adults, a majority of newborn umbilical hernias will close spontaneously – about 85% closure rate by age five years. Larger umbilical hernias – vaguely defined as those over 1. 5 cm in diameter – have a lower likelihood of spontaneous closure. Complications of umbilical hernia, such as incarceration or strangulation are very rare; thus, the risk/benefit ratio in surgical closure of umbilical hernias strongly favors observation. Even markedly large or protuberant umbilical hernias may undergo spontaneous closure and are not clearly associated with an increased risk of complications when not surgically closed. Nonoperative closure techniques such as umbilical strapping are generally ineffective, can lead to skin breakdown, and should be avoided. Complications following umbilical hernia repair in children are rare and may include infection and recurrence. Recurrence rates appear to be higher in children repaired at an early age.

### Guidelines for laparoscopic (TAPP) and endoscopic (TEP) treatment of inguinal hernia [International Endohernia Society (IEHS)] [^111sPQBs]. Surgical Endoscopy (2011). Low credibility.

A significant proportion of incidental defects will progress to a symptomatic hernia if left untreated (28% within 15 months). Therefore, incidental hernias should be simultaneously repaired if the patient has agreed [26]; 11% of clinically unrecognized hernias were repaired at the time of surgery.

TAPP herniorrhaphy is beneficial to avoid unnecessary explorations and allow timely repairs in patients with occult inguinal hernias [25, 42]. Although the reported incidence of chronic pain after TAPP repair is very low, the simultaneous repair of the healthy contralateral groin "in advance" is not justified unless a "significant collagen deficiency" is suspected.

Anatomical landmarks, peritoneal incision, extent of dissection

Statements

Recommendations

In the majority of cases, the anatomical points of primary orientation are visible or demonstrable by external palpation: the medial umbilical ligament (MUL), the lower epigastric vessels (the lateral umbilical ligament), the deep (inner) inguinal ring, the anterior superior iliac spine (ASIS), and the spermatic structures (vas deferens and spermatic vessels) or the round ligament. The other important structures (secondary orientation) become visible during the preperitoneal dissection: the ileopubic tract, the symphysis pubis, Cooper's ligament, and the femoral canal.

### 2017 update of the WSES guidelines for emergency repair of complicated abdominal wall hernias [^117GuhST]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Background

A large number of abdominal hernias require emergency surgery. However, these procedures may be associated with poor prognosis and a significant rate of postoperative complications.

Abdominal hernias may be classified as groin hernias (femoral or inguinal) and ventral hernias (umbilical, epigastric, Spigelian, lumbar, and incisional).

An incarcerated hernia is a hernia in which the content has become irreducible due to a narrow opening in the abdominal wall or due to adhesions between the content and the hernia sac. Moreover, intestinal obstruction may complicate an incarcerated hernia. A strangulated hernia occurs when the blood supply to the contents of the hernia (e.g. omentum, bowel) is compromised. Strangulated hernias remain a significant challenge, as they are sometimes difficult to diagnose by physical examination and require urgent surgical intervention. Early surgical intervention of a strangulated hernia with obstruction is crucial as delayed diagnosis can result in the need for bowel resection with prolonged recovery and increased complication rate. Strangulated hernias may lead to bacterial translocation and intestinal wall necrosis (potentially resulting in bowel perforation). This condition significantly increases the risks in emergency hernia repair that may lead to an increased incidence of surgical site contamination and recurrence.

An interesting topic is the use of laparoscopy in emergency hernia repair. However, its role in acute settings is not well established yet.

Bacteria inherently colonize all surgical wounds, but not all of these contaminations ultimately lead to infection. In most patients, infection does not occur because innate host defences are able to eliminate microbes at the surgical site. However, there is some evidence that the implantation of foreign materials, such as prosthetic mesh, may lead to a decreased threshold for infection.

While many factors can influence surgical wound healing and postoperative infection, bacterial burden is the most significant risk factor. According to the likelihood and degree of wound contamination at the time of operation, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) wound classification stratifies the wound as follows:
Class I = clean wounds
Class II = clean-contaminated wounds
Class III = contaminated wounds
Class IV = dirty or infected wounds (Table 1)

### Groin pain and injuries: evaluation and management [^115o46qD]. American Family Physician (2025). Medium credibility.

Groin pain is a common symptom in athletes and the general population. Etiologies include musculoskeletal conditions involving the pubic rami, hip joints, pelvic floor, and abdominal wall, as well as hernias and genitourinary conditions. Differentiating musculoskeletal from nonmusculoskeletal symptoms and identifying a specific cause can be a diagnostic challenge. A systematic approach to physical examination can focus the differential diagnosis and guide additional evaluation and specific management. Physical examination should include direct palpation and testing for the major musculoskeletal causes of groin pain: adductor, pubic, inguinal, and iliopsoas. In patients with adductor-related groin pain, magnetic resonance imaging of the pelvis should be performed if the diagnosis is unclear or if symptoms have not improved after initial conservative management. Active, supervised physical therapy is the initial treatment recommended for adductor- and pubic-related groin pain. In patients with inguinal-related groin pain, dynamic ultra-sonography should be performed to rule out a true hernia and evaluate for posterior abdominal wall weakness. Initial management for patients with inguinal-related groin pain without evidence of a hernia is physical therapy focusing on core strengthening and neuromuscular rehabilitation. Hip radiography and magnetic resonance imaging are preferred in patients with suspected iliopsoas-related groin pain because there is often concomitant hip pathology. Am Fam Physician. 2025; 111(4): 337–343.

### Congenital hernia of cord: an often misdiagnosed entity [^116o1Fdh]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

Congenital hernia of the cord, also known as umbilical cord hernia, is an often misdiagnosed and under-reported entity, easily confused with a small omphalocele. It is different from postnatally diagnosed umbilical hernias and is believed to arise from persistent physiological mid-gut herniation. Its incidence is estimated to be 1 in 5000. Unlike an omphalocele, it is considered benign and is not linked with chromosomal anomalies. It has been loosely associated with intestinal anomalies, suggesting the need for a complete fetal anatomical ultrasound evaluation. We present a case of a fetal umbilical cord hernia diagnosed in a 28-year-old woman at 21 weeks gestation. The antenatal and intrapartum courses were uncomplicated. It was misdiagnosed postnatally as a small omphalocele, causing unwarranted anxiety in the parents. Increased awareness and knowledge of such an entity among health professionals is important to prevent unwarranted anxiety from misdiagnosis, and inadvertent bowel injury during cord clamping at delivery.

### Guidelines for treatment of umbilical and epigastric hernias from the European hernia society and americas hernia society [^112MS1tj]. The British Journal of Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Umbilical and epigastric hernia repairs are frequently performed surgical procedures with an expected low complication rate. Nevertheless, the optimal method of repair with best short- and long-term outcomes remains debatable. The aim was to develop guidelines for the treatment of umbilical and epigastric hernias.

Methods

The guideline group consisted of surgeons from Europe and North America including members from the European Hernia Society and the Americas Hernia Society. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach, the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) critical appraisal checklists, and the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) instrument were used. A systematic literature search was done on 1 May 2018, and updated on 1 February 2019.

Results

Literature reporting specifically on umbilical and epigastric hernias was limited in quantity and quality, resulting in a majority of the recommendations being graded as weak, based on low-quality evidence. The main recommendation was to use mesh for repair of umbilical and epigastric hernias to reduce the recurrence rate. Most umbilical and epigastric hernias may be repaired by an open approach with a preperitoneal flat mesh. A laparoscopic approach may be considered if the hernia defect is large, or if the patient has an increased risk of wound morbidity.

Conclusion

This is the first European and American guideline on the treatment of umbilical and epigastric hernias. It is recommended that symptomatic umbilical and epigastric hernias are repaired by an open approach with a preperitoneal flat mesh.

### Incarceration of umbilical hernia: a rare complication of large volume paracentesis [^1166ooa3]. Journal of Radiology Case Reports (2015). Low credibility.

We present two cases of umbilical hernia incarceration following large volume paracentesis (LVP) in patients with cirrhotic ascites. Both patients became symptomatic within 48 hours after the LVP. Although being rare, given the significantly higher mortality rate of cirrhotic patients undergoing emergent herniorrhaphy, this complication of LVP is potentially serious. Therefore, it is recommended that patients be examined closely for the presence of umbilical hernias before removal of ascitic fluid and an attempt should be made for external reduction of easily reducible hernias, if a hernia is present.

### Predictors of spontaneous resolution of umbilical hernia in children [^111pRZTo]. World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study sought to examine the clinical outcomes and complications of umbilical hernias as well as to identify factors for spontaneous resolution among children. In our study population, nearly half experienced spontaneous resolution of hernia by 4–5 years of age. The low rate of strangulation and incarceration suggests that if left untreated, umbilical hernia may resolve by itself. The low rate of perioperative complications (n = 33; 1.26%) and reoccurrence (n = 20; 0.76%) further suggests that repair is a safe procedure, even after 4–5 years of age. These findings are consistent with a recent American study, which stated that the rate of preoperative complications in umbilical hernia (eg, incarceration, strangulation, and evisceration) were low, occurring in approximately 1 in 1500 hernias. Overall, our study findings suggest that patients with asymptomatic umbilical hernia can be followed up safely by their family physician until 4–5 years of age, at least at our institution. Caution should be exercised when generalizing our results to other institutions across Canada.

Our study demonstrated that for every 1 mm increase in defect size, the odds of spontaneous resolution of umbilical hernia decreased by 5%. Despite 89.1% of hernias closing spontaneously at age 6, a study conducted by Walker and colleagues found that larger hernias were also less likely to close; in fact, 0% (0/21) with a defect > 1.5 cm were closed by 6 years of age. In contrast, hernia prevalence may decrease with increasing age, indicating that the majority of large hernias may close by ages 3–4 without the need for surgery. Although not statistically significant in our study, prior literature attests that comorbidities, such as childhood obesity, may impact the likelihood of spontaneous closure. Interestingly, in our study, 40% of men and 38.7% of women had spontaneous resolution of umbilical hernia; however, when examining results of the logistic regression, this difference based on gender is not statistically significant. In other words, at least in our sample, there is no difference in frequency of spontaneous resolution of umbilical hernia among men versus women.

### Pediatric hernia repair: 1-stop shopping [^113WhFQj]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose

Multiple visits for the evaluation, treatment, and follow-up of straightforward surgical problems are inconvenient, can result in lost work for the parents, and missed school for the child. We hypothesized that with proper previsit screening, patients with select diagnoses can be evaluated in an outpatient clinic setting and undergo operation the same day.

Methods

Criteria were developed to identify straightforward referrals to our surgical practice for umbilical, epigastric, or inguinal hernias. Scripting was created to offer families the option of consultation and, if indicated, surgical treatment on the same day. Data collected included number of patients, cases performed, insurance status, and consultation reimbursement and surgical fees. Families were surveyed postoperatively.

Results

Sixty-one patient candidates participated. The diagnosis and indication for surgery were confirmed in 56 (92%), of which 50 underwent repair the day of their consultation. Seventy-two percent of patients had commercial insurance, whereas 28% had Medicaid. The preoperative consultation fee was reimbursed in 39 (78%) of 50 encounters (57% Medicaid, 86% commercial). All surgical cases were reimbursed. Patient and family satisfaction was high.

Conclusions

We conclude that it is feasible to provide same-day evaluation and service for straightforward pediatric hernias with acceptable financial reimbursement and high parent satisfaction.

### Prevalence of umbilical hernias by computed tomography [^115Wb1Dr]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Umbilical hernias (UHs) are commonly underdiagnosed due to their asymptomatic presentation. The aim was to determine the prevalence of UHs by computed tomography (CT) in a trauma center, to assess the magnitude of their underdiagnosis.

Methods

A cross-sectional study was designed, using CT studies to evaluate the integrity of the abdominal wall. The images were obtained from consecutive cases of adult patients (≥ 18 y) from the database of the radiology and imaging service during a 4-mo period. The sociodemographic features, type of CT scan, and description of the abdominal wall were obtained and compared with the radiology report. In the case of UH presence, the transversal, cephalocaudal, and anteroposterior lengths, as well as its content, were registered.

Results

A total of 472 CT scans were included with a 67.6% (n = 319) prevalence of UH. These were most common in men (58.9%, n = 188/319), but women were more likely to have UH ≥ 10 mm (55%, n = 72/131). Of those with UH, 63.6% were unreported by radiology. The most common content was peritoneal fat (87.5%). UH had medians (interquartile range) of 9.1 mm (6.8, 12.5), 8.3 mm (6, 11.5), and 12.8 mm (8.6, 18.2) in its transversal, cephalocaudal, and anteroposterior lengths, respectively. Transversal length had a high positive correlation with cephalocaudal length (r = 0.877). This datum relationship can be explained by at least 76% due to this factor. Interobserver reliability analyses resulted in substantial reliability (ICC > 0.85 and k > 0.85).

Conclusions

CT is an effective imaging tool for diagnosing UH. There is a high prevalence among the general adult population, with a high radiologic underreporting.

### Contemporary practice and perceptions surrounding the management of asymptomatic umbilical hernias in children: a survey of the American Pediatric Surgical Association [^1144GPnb]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To explore variation in perceptions regarding the natural history of asymptomatic umbilical hernias, and to characterize the influence of clinical and nonclinical factors on decision-making surrounding timing of repair.

Methods

This was a survey of the American Pediatric Surgical Association. Branching logic and Likert scale questions were used to explore perceptions surrounding natural history (risk of complications and likelihood of spontaneous closure), preferred age for repair, and influence of anatomic, caregiver, sociodemographic, and biological factors on operative timing.

Results

44% of members completed the survey (371/846). The most common age respondents would consider elective repair was 3 years (37%), although the majority preferred to wait until 4 or 5 years (54%). Most respondents estimated a < 1% risk of complications for unrepaired defects, and much greater variability was found in the perceived likelihood of spontaneous closure over time. Decision-making surrounding operative timing was most influenced by anatomic factors (larger defects, proboscoid changes, and interval growth) and parental anxiety surrounding need for emergency surgery, cosmesis, and stigma of parental neglect.

Conclusion

Practice and perceptions surrounding management of asymptomatic umbilical hernias vary widely. More robust epidemiological data are needed to define the likelihood of spontaneous closure in the context of age and physical exam findings. Collaborative efforts between surgeons and referring providers are also needed to optimize management of caregiver anxiety and expectations surrounding need for surgical referral and repair.

### Prospective analysis of outcomes in umbilical hernia repair for patients with decompensated cirrhosis [^1169HNzg]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Mortality rates at 12 months were similar for both herniorrhaphy and hernioplasty in our cohort. Our finding is in line with other studies where hernioplasty was applied for UHR with favorable outcomes, mainly affected by CPT score, surgeons' skills and experience. Laparoscopic umbilical hernia repair and other novel approaches, such as complex abdominal wall reconstruction with biologic mesh, have been also proposed as effective and probably safer operative options in selected cases. In a more recent retrospective study of 1983 patients with liver dysfunction and AST-to-platelet ratio index ≥ 1 who underwent UHR, 476 patients had a laparoscopic surgical approach. No difference in serious complications and mortality rates was found, but laparoscopy was associated with shorter hospital stays and lower transfusion requirements compared to the open surgical approach.

The main limitations of our study are the small sample size, the non-randomized design and the inclusion of a disproportionately high number of emergency UHR cases compared to elective procedures. Consequently, our study lacks sufficient power to accurately detect the clinical and laboratory characteristics of cirrhotic patients with umbilical hernia who would benefit most from an early and elective UHR. Another limitation is that since we did not have the first diagnosis of umbilical hernia in every patient, there was no information about the time between umbilical hernia diagnosis and treatment.

Considering the limited number of studies examining UHR in patients with decompensated cirrhosis and ascites, our study adds to the current body of knowledge on this topic. We confirmed that advanced CTP classes (B and C) are the primary factors driving poor survival in these patients. Opting for UHR, under local anesthesia if possible, and preferably at earlier stages of cirrhosis, is the optimal practice. Further larger and well-designed randomized studies are warranted to guide the operative management of cirrhotic patients with ascites and umbilical hernia.

Summary Box

What is already known:

Studies examining the type of surgery and the exact timing for umbilical hernia repair (UHR) in decompensated cirrhotic patients with ascites are limited
Data on risk stratification for UHR in patients with end-stage liver disease and ascites are elusive

What the new findings are:

We prospectively assessed the short- and long-term outcomes of 19 cirrhotic patients with ascites, who underwent either elective or emergency UHR, and evaluated any possible risk factors associated with these outcomes
Patients who underwent UHR, either electively or urgently, had high overall mortality rates of 26.32% at 30 days and 68.42% at 12 months, with worse outcomes in the elective UHR group
We confirmed that advanced Child-Turcotte-Pugh classes B and C are the primary factors driving poor survival in these patients
Opting for UHR under local anesthesia, preferably at earlier stages of cirrhosis, is the optimal practice

### The making of fetal surgery [^111oPgMe]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2010). Low credibility.

Fetal diagnosis prompts the question for fetal therapy in highly selected cases. Some conditions are suitable for in utero surgical intervention. This paper reviews historically important steps in the development of fetal surgery. The first invasive fetal intervention in 1963 was an intra-uterine blood transfusion. It took another 20 years to understand the pathophysiology of other candidate fetal conditions and to develop safe anaesthetic and surgical techniques before the team at the University of California at San Francisco performed its first urinary diversion through hysterotomy. This procedure would be abandoned as renal and pulmonary function could be just as effectively salvaged by ultrasound-guided insertion of a bladder shunt. Fetoscopy is another method for direct access to the feto-placental unit. It was historically used for fetal visualisation to guide biopsies or for vascular access but was also abandoned following the introduction of high-resolution ultrasound. Miniaturisation revived fetoscopy in the 1990 s, since when it has been successfully used to operate on the placenta and umbilical cord. Today, it is also used in fetuses with congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH), in whom lung growth is triggered by percutaneous tracheal occlusion. It can also be used to diagnose and treat urinary obstruction. Many fetal interventions remain investigational but for a number of conditions randomised trials have established the role of in utero surgery, making fetal surgery a clinical reality in a number of fetal therapy programmes. The safety of fetal surgery is such that even non-lethal conditions, such as myelomeningocoele repair, are at this moment considered a potential indication. This, as well as fetal intervention for CDH, is currently being investigated in randomised trials.

### Surgical management of umbilical endometrioma within an umbilical hernia [^1122cTst]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

In summary, umbilical endometriosis should enter into the differential diagnosis of umbilical tumours, and the workup should include a search for pelvic endometriosis. Surgical excision in this reported case had a 2-year recurrence-free interval but was complicated by a surgical site infection. Several umbilicoplasty techniques exist for optimal cosmesis. We agree with the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology guidelines which state that surgical management is preferred for extrapelvic endometriosis as it removes the symptomatic mass and provides a histopathological diagnosis. Medical management may have a role in the treatment of umbilical endometriosis although further studies in cases of endometriosis in a hernia are warranted, as it may be futile to attempt medical therapy, prolonging time to surgery. The role of medical management after surgery to prevent recurrence also deserves further study especially in the presence of pelvic endometriosis.

Learning points

Recognise the prevalence of extrapelvic endometriosis in reproductive age women.
Umbilical endometriosis usually presents with catamenial symptoms and can exist within an umbilical hernia.
After complete surgical excision, individualised approaches to umbilical reconstruction based on patient and disease characteristics may be warranted.

### A febrile infant with abdominal erythema and irritability [^115AWtaT]. Clinical Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Case Report

A 37-day-old male was evaluated in the emergency department for 24 hours of fever to 102°F, abdominal erythema, and irritability. The patient was also reported to have 10 days of watery, gray stools on an appropriate diet of generic formula and breastmilk. The patient was the product of a full-term pregnancy and a C-section delivery due to breech positioning with no perinatal complications.

On initial assessment, the patient was febrile to 38.6°C, tachycardic to 190 bpm, tachypneic to 70 breaths/minute with normal oxygen saturations and blood pressure. He was fussy and difficult to console, and he had obvious erythema of the umbilical and periumbilical region (Figure 1). The abdomen was diffusely tender to palpation with gross distension. A small umbilical hernia was irreducible with patient straining.

Figure 1.
Physical exam of patient's abdomen showing periumbilical erythema and mild umbilical hernia. The patient's abdomen was also distended and tender to palpation.

Pertinent laboratory findings included a normal complete blood count and complete metabolic profile, C-reactive protein of 10.7 mg/dL (ref.: 0.0–1.0 mg/dL), and procalcitonin of 1.47 ng/mL (ref.: < 0.05 ng/mL). Urinalysis was unremarkable, urine and blood cultures were drawn, and an attempted lumbar puncture was unsuccessful.

Plain films demonstrated diffuse gaseous distension of bowel throughout the abdomen without dilated loops of bowel. Intraluminal gas extended to the rectum. No appreciable free intraperitoneal air, pneumatosis, or portal venous gas was noted. Abdominal ultrasound showed hyperemic soft tissue with surrounding inflammatory stranding and a small amount of fluid with mild hyperemia of the bowel near the site of the herniation suggestive of an incarcerated umbilical hernia without strangulation. An abdominal computed tomography (CT) (Figure 2) suggested a central abdominal wall hernia containing loops of small bowel with associated mild mucosal hyper-enhancement and thickening, potentially concerning for strangulation/incarceration, but without evidence of bowel obstruction. Alternatively suggested was a small fluid collection related to an infected umbilicus.

### Septic shock after endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty: a post-procedural complication? [^115yj4VT]. Obesity Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

ESG is a safe and effective technique in the obesity management, usually indicated in class I and II obesity. It is also an acceptable treatment in patients with class III obesity who have high surgical risk or refuse surgery. This procedure results in a significant weight loss and important improvement in metabolic comorbidities. Nevertheless, there are several procedure-related complications. Few cases of gastric perforation following ESG have been reported. We present a case of septic shock after ESG with preoperative diagnostic uncertainties.

Methods

We present the case of a 54-year-old male with a BMI of 43.6 kg/m2 who underwent ESG 7 days before in an external center. The patient came to the emergency department presenting abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting since the day after the procedure. Physical examination revealed hemodynamic instability, altered level of consciousness, diffuse abdominal pain, and a painful umbilical lump due to a complicated umbilical hernia. Emergent surgery was decided after preoperative assessment.

Results

Intraoperative gastroscopy was performed, viewing a gastric ischemic ulcer covered with fibrin and a mucosal defect and suspecting a covered gastric perforation. Firstly, we performed an open approach to the complicated umbilical hernia. Subsequently, an exploratory laparoscopy was performed through the hernial ring, where a fibrin-covered area was evidenced in the anterior face of the gastric body, adhered to the round ligament by a transmural suture of the ESG. Additionally, multiple transmural sutures were observed adhered to the greater omentum and lesser sac and an intramural hematoma in the greater gastric curvature. No intra-abdominal free fluid was evidenced. A laparoscopic barbed suture of the area covered with fibrin was performed, after its release from the round ligament. The adhesions of the sutures and metallic material from the ESG were released. Finally, two abdominal drains were placed in the anterior and posterior gastric face. The patient presented superficial incisional surgical site infection and was discharged 6 days after laparoscopic surgery.

Conclusions

ESG is a novel procedure, which has proven to be an effective alternative in the treatment of obesity. However, this technique may have major complications that can require urgent surgery.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® hernia [^116mgPb9]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Abdominopelvic hernias are common clinical entities composed of a wide variety of congenital, traumatic, and iatrogenic etiologies. Any weakness in the body wall may result in hernia of cavity contents with concomitant risks of morbidity and mortality. Presentations may be specific, palpable body wall mass/bulge, or vague, nonspecific pain through bowel obstruction. This document focuses on initial imaging of the adult population with signs of symptoms prompting suspicion of abdominopelvic hernia. Imaging of the abdomen and pelvis to evaluate defects is essential for prompt diagnosis and treatment. Often CT and ultrasound are the first-line modalities to quickly evaluate the abdomen and pelvis, providing for accurate diagnoses and management of patients. MRI protocols may be useful as first-line imaging studies, especially in patients with orthopedic instrumentation. Although often performed, abdominal radiographs and fluorographic procedures may provide indirect evidence of hernias but are usually not indicated for initial diagnosis of hernia. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer-reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances in which peer-reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

### Practice variation in umbilical hernia repair demonstrates a need for best practice guidelines [^117AahWZ]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate and better understand variations in practice patterns, we analyzed ambulatory surgery claims data from 3 demographically diverse states to assess the relationship between age at umbilical hernia repair and patient, hospital, and geographic characteristics.

Study Design

We performed a cross-sectional descriptive study of uncomplicated hernia repairs performed as a single procedure in 2012–2014, using the State Ambulatory Surgery and Services Database for Wisconsin, New York, and Florida. Age and demographic characteristics of umbilical hernia repair patients are described.

Results

The State Ambulatory Surgery and Services Database analysis included 6551 patients. Across 3 states, 8.2% of hernia repairs were performed in children < 2 years, 18.7% in children age 2–3 years, and 73.0% in children age ≥ 4 years, but there was significant variability (P < .001) in practice patterns by state. In regression analysis, race, Medicaid insurance and rural residence were predictive of early repair, with African American patients less likely to have a repair before age 2 (OR 0.62, P = 0.046) and rural children (OR 1.53, P = 0.009) and Medicaid patients (OR 2.01, P < .001) more likely to do so. State of residence predicted early repair even when holding these variables constant.

Conclusions

The age of pediatric umbilical hernia repair varies widely. As hernias may resolve over time and can be safely monitored with watchful waiting, formal guidelines are needed to support delayed repair and prevent unnecessary operations.

### Predictors of spontaneous resolution of umbilical hernia in children [^1164PWTo]. World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Results from this study demonstrate that pediatric umbilical hernias are unlikely to become strangulated or incarcerated. The probability of spontaneous resolution of umbilical hernia decreases with an increase in defect size while controlling for prematurity and other comorbidities. On the other hand, probability of non-resolution increases with prematurity. In light of these findings, factors such as prematurity and increasing defect size should continue to be considered during the management of children with umbilical hernia in Ontario. Because umbilical hernias are usually a benign condition with a very low complication rate, family physicians should encourage parents to monitor their child's condition until 4–5 years of age while being cognizant of any potential complications. Overall, conservative management is justifiable and appropriate during pediatric monitoring of asymptomatic umbilical hernia.

In conclusion, we aimed to characterize the probability of spontaneous resolution for umbilical hernia in our Eastern Ontario cohort. Overall, our study determined that the odds of spontaneous resolution were lower for premature babies and were negatively correlated with defect size. As such, continued monitoring of defect size and prematurity is warranted during umbilical hernia management of children in Ontario.

### Meta-analysis to determine optimal timing for repair of inguinal hernia in pre-term infants [^116RbWuK]. World Journal of Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

5 Conclusion

The timing of inguinal hernia repair requires a careful balance between the surgical risk of incarceration, which favors early intervention, and the perioperative anesthetic risks and potential for recurrence, which may suggest delaying the procedure. Based on current evidence, delaying repair may be safe for preterm infants with respiratory issues, provided there are no hernia complications. Ultimately, the decision should be tailored to individual patient risks and clinical contexts. However, prospective studies, randomized controlled trials, and long‐term follow‐up are needed to provide more precise comparisons and inform clinical decision‐making.

### Umbilical cord hernias: prenatal diagnosis and natural history [^1139FMMS]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Objectives

The purpose of this study was to describe the characteristics and outcomes of umbilical cord hernias diagnosed prenatally.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective study of all pregnancies with the diagnosis of a fetal umbilical cord hernia during a 5-year period. All women received care from a multidisciplinary team and underwent complete meticulous sonography for structural malformations as well as fetal echocardiography and amniocentesis.

Results

Between 2004 and 2009, isolated fetal umbilical cord hernias were diagnosed in 8 pregnant women. The gestational ages at the time of referral ranged from 16 to 28 weeks (median, 20 weeks). In 1 case, intrauterine fetal death occurred at 35 weeks due to rupture of the umbilical cord. All remaining cases were delivered at 36 to 40 weeks, and the neonates underwent corrective surgery with good outcomes.

Conclusions

Despite 1 case complicated by intrauterine fetal death in this study, the outcome of an isolated fetal umbilical hernia seems favorable.

### Painful enlarging umbilical nodule with cyclical swelling [^113dwNAb]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Question 2: Which test would be most diagnostic?
A. Abdominal ultrasound
B. CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis
C. Laparoscopic evaluation
D. Biopsy of the nodule
E. MRI of the abdomen

Answers:
A. Abdominal ultrasound – Incorrect. While abdominal ultrasound can be used to diagnose and screen for complications of an umbilical hernia, it would not be diagnostic for umbilical endometriosis.
B. CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis – Incorrect. Umbilical endometriosis cannot be diagnosed on radiographic appearance alone. An abdominopelvic CT is necessary in the workup of a Sister Mary Joseph nodule to delineate the source and extent of metastatic malignancy.
C. Laparoscopic evaluation – Incorrect. Laparoscopy is the gold standard for diagnosing pelvic endometriosis but does not confirm cutaneous endometriosis. While many patients with primary umbilical endometriosis have concomitant pelvic endometriosis, the literature reveals patients with umbilical endometriosis without pelvic endometriosis.
D. Biopsy of the nodule – Correct. Biopsy exhibits an acanthotic epidermis overlying ectatic glands lined by columnar-type epithelium and surrounded by endometrial-type stroma and hemosiderin-laden macrophages (Fig 2). Biopsy should be performed when cutaneous endometriosis is suspected due to the potential for malignant transformation. No malignant cells were detected in this case.
E. MRI of the abdomen – Incorrect. Magnetic resonance imaging cannot diagnose cutaneous endometriosis since radiographic findings are not diagnostic. MRI can be a useful tool for evaluating the depth of invasion of DFSP.

### British society of gastroenterology best practice guidance: outpatient management of cirrhosis-part 3: special circumstances [^116gdpoc]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Table 1
Predictive models used in patients with cirrhosis undergoing surgery

In patients with cirrhosis, non-urgent surgery should be deferred until an adequate assessment has been undertaken and their liver disease optimised. The clinical team should consider referral to a unit with experience in managing patients with cirrhosis, where appropriate. Consideration should also be given to non-surgical options if available/appropriate. Care should be taken to optimise nutrition. For patients with compensated cirrhosis, after appropriate perioperative risk stratification and counselling, surgery may then be indicated.

Emergency surgery in patients with cirrhosis carries an increased mortality risk, and cirrhosis is an independent predictor of death. In the emergency setting, where deferring surgery may not be feasible, the patient and surgical, anaesthetic and medical teams must weigh the potential benefits and risks collaboratively. Table 2 summarises the anaesthetic considerations when planning surgery in patients with cirrhosis.

Table 2
Anaesthetic considerations in the cirrhotic patient

Surgery in decompensated cirrhosis

Surgery in patients with decompensated cirrhosis carries a significantly higher mortality risk than compensated cirrhosis. Eligibility for liver transplantation, if the patient was to decompensate following surgery, should be determined prior to surgery. In patients with Child-Pugh C or MELD > 20, surgery should be avoided or delayed until after liver transplantation, if possible, for all but the most urgent and lifesaving procedures. Good palliation of symptoms is crucial in patients unsuitable for transplant where surgery is considered too high risk, as well as in all patients waiting for surgery post-transplant.

Abdominal wall hernias are common in patients with cirrhosis and ascites, and mortality is high in those undergoing surgery. The clinical team should consider discussion with an experienced centre to guide management of recurrent ascites with transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPSS) and other sequelae of decompensation in the perioperative/postoperative period. The decision to offer hernia repair and its timing will be influenced by the patient's eligibility for liver transplantation and the nature of their presentation. Where patients have undergone assessment and are awaiting liver transplantation, hernia repair may be deferred until the time of transplantation (when it can be undertaken during or following liver transplantation). In patients who are not candidates for liver transplantation elective repair of symptomatic umbilical hernia (if feasible) can be undertaken and may avoid the added risk of emergency surgery. In patients who develop life-threatening complications of an abdominal wall hernia (skin breakdown with leaking ascites, incarceration, obstruction or strangulation) emergency repair may still be undertaken but the morbidity and mortality increases significantly.

### Diagnosis, evaluation, and management of ascites, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and hepatorenal syndrome: 2021 practice guidance by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^117ErjcY]. Hepatology (2021). High credibility.

Abdominal hernias in cirrhosis and ascites — Abdominal wall and inguinal hernias are common, and umbilical hernias develop in approximately 20% of patients with cirrhosis. Hernias may result from increased abdominal pressure from ascites with weakened abdominal muscles, and poor nutrition can lead to rapidly enlarging hernias, whereas optimal fluid control, appropriate nutrition, and conservative management with binders may minimize or prevent hernia development and progression. Hernias may present with incarceration, pressure necrosis, rupture, evisceration, and peritonitis, and a rapid decline in the ascitic fluid volume (e.g. LVP) can paradoxically cause incarceration. Patients who are candidates for liver transplantation (LT) in the near future should defer hernia repair until during or after transplantation, while for patients in whom transplantation is not imminent elective herniorrhaphy may be offered after careful consideration of risks and benefits, with a possible need for an emergent operation. Clinically apparent ascites should be controlled before elective herniorrhaphy, laparoscopic approaches are preferred, the use of prosthetic mesh may reduce recurrence but may increase infections and other complications, and postoperatively control of ascites and optimization of nutrition are key determinants of successful outcome.

### Update of guidelines for laparoscopic treatment of ventral and incisional abdominal wall hernias (International Endohernia Society (IEHS))-part a… [^1154sLuS]. Surgical Endoscopy (2019). Medium credibility.

Indication related to size

From a randomized clinical trial comparing laparoscopic vs open incisional hernia repair with 206 patients from 10 hospitals [9], the authors found that the defect size was an independent predictor for recurrence (p < 0.001) [9]. In a prospective nationwide study [3], they also found that defect size was a risk factor for emergency repair. Furthermore, older age, female gender, and umbilical hernia defects between 2 and 7 cm or incisional hernia defects up to 7 cm were important risk factors for emergency repair. A retrospective study also revealed that there was a correlation between the hernia gap size and risk factors [10], while another trial comparing laparoscopic and open mesh repair found that hernia size did not influence the surgical outcomes [11].

### Mesh versus suture repair of umbilical hernia in adults: a randomised, double-blind, controlled, multicentre trial [^1158KqP8]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

Background

Both mesh and suture repair are used for the treatment of umbilical hernias, but for smaller umbilical hernias (diameter 1–4 cm) there is little evidence whether mesh repair would be beneficial. In this study we aimed to investigate whether use of a mesh was better in reducing recurrence compared with suture repair for smaller umbilical hernias.

Methods

We did a randomised, double-blind, controlled multicentre trial in 12 hospitals (nine in the Netherlands, two in Germany, and one in Italy). Eligible participants were adults aged at least 18 years with a primary umbilical hernia of diameter 1–4 cm, and were randomly assigned (1:1) intraoperatively to either suture repair or mesh repair. In the first 3 years of the inclusion period, blocked randomisation (of non-specified size) was achieved by an envelope randomisation system; after this time computer-generated randomisation was introduced. Patients, investigators, and analysts were masked to the allocated treatment, and participants were stratified by hernia size (1–2 cm and > 2–4 cm). At study initiation, all surgeons were invited to training sessions to ensure they used the same standardised techniques for suture repair or mesh repair. Patients underwent physical examinations at 2 weeks, and 3, 12, and 24–30 months after the operation. The primary outcome was the rate of recurrences of the umbilical hernia after 24 months assessed in the modified intention-to-treat population by physical examination and, in case of any doubt, abdominal ultrasound. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00789230.

Findings

Between June 21, 2006, and April 16, 2014, we randomly assigned 300 patients, 150 to mesh repair and 150 to suture repair. The median follow-up was 25.1 months (IQR 15.5–33.4). After a maximum follow-up of 30 months, there were fewer recurrences in the mesh group than in the suture group (six [4%] in 146 patients vs 17 [12%] in 138 patients; 2-year actuarial estimates of recurrence 3.6% [95% CI 1.4–9.4] vs 11.4% (6.8–18.9); p = 0.01, hazard ratio 0.31, 95% CI 0.12–0.80, corresponding to a number needed to treat of 12.8). The most common postoperative complications were seroma (one [< 1%] in the suture group vs five [3%] in the mesh group), haematoma (two [1%] vs three [2%]), and wound infection (one [< 1%] vs three [2%]). There were no anaesthetic complications or postoperative deaths.

Interpretation

This is the first study showing high level evidence for mesh repair in patients with small hernias of diameter 1–4 cm. Hence we suggest mesh repair should be used for operations on all patients with an umbilical hernia of this size.

### Spontaneous bowel evisceration through umbilical hernia in an adult non-cirrhotic patient [^111X8dBe]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

Figure 3
Factors contributing to umbilical hernia, skin necrosis and rupture, and small bowel evisceration (Author: Dr Matteo Zanchetta).

Learning points

Spontaneous hernia sac rupture is a sporadic occurrence, and accompanying small bowel evisceration is even rarer, particularly in patients without cirrhosis.
Spontaneous bowel evisceration through umbilical hernia (UH) is commonly associated with chronic increase in intra-abdominal pressure, such as refractory ascites in cirrhotic patients, obesity and pregnancy.
Each UH patient necessitates tailored management, and apart from asymptomatic UHs with no aesthetic compromise, this abdominal wall defect should always be repaired surgically, possibly electively to decrease the risk of complications associated with emergency repair.
Surgery is always necessary for small bowel evisceration through UH; and in emergency settings, a direct repair of the defect is advocated.
Mesh placement should always be considered if comorbidities do not contraindicate it.

### The combined laparoscopic approach for the treatment of incarcerated inguinal hernia [^114GxSCk]. Surgical Endoscopy (2010). Low credibility.

Background

The traditional open approach to incarcerated inguinal hernia has several drawbacks including difficulty avoiding tension in the swollen and edematous tissues leading to a higher recurrence rate, possible contamination of the mesh if it is implanted in an area of bowel strangulation, and proper evaluation of whether ischemic bowel requires resection or not, which may mandate laparotomy. This study aimed to evaluate an approach that combines intraperitoneal laparoscopic exploration with hernia reduction and total extraperitoneal (TEP) repair of the hernia.

Methods

An exploratory laparoscopy is performed. The incarcerated content is gently retracted into the abdominal cavity and inspected. If no resection is needed, the gas is deflated, the umbilical trocar is removed, and the preperitoneal space is accessed with a Hasson trocar inserted behind the rectus muscle toward the pelvis. Two additional 5-mm trocars are inserted into the preperitoneal space in the lower midline. A standard TEP repair with mesh is performed.

Results

Between 2005 and 2008, 15 patients underwent laparoscopic exploration for incarcerated inguinal hernia followed by TEP repair. Of the 15 patients, 8 had acute incarceration and 7 had chronic irreducible hernia. Reduction of the incarcerated content was straightforward, and no bowel resection was needed. No major complications or wound or mesh infections occurred.

Conclusion

The combined laparoscopic approach offers a solution to incarceration of inguinal hernias while taking advantage of each separate approach. The first part of the procedure enables easy reduction of the incarcerated content and assessment of its viability. The second part enables a simple and standard repair, similar to that for an elective case. If bowel necrosis is suspected preoperatively, an open anterior approach should be taken to avoid possible intraabdominal contamination.

### Predictors of spontaneous resolution of umbilical hernia in children [^112UKv3b]. World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Methods

After obtaining approval from our institution's research ethics board (REB), we performed a retrospective chart review in EPIC (Electronic Health Records). Hyperspace of all patients referred for umbilical hernia to CHEO between January 1990 and April 2017.

Study participants were identified from patient records, based on the diagnostic code for umbilical hernia obtained from the CHEO Clinical Research Unit. We included all children under 18 years of age who were referred to CHEO for umbilical hernia repair during the designated capture period, which explained how our study sample size was obtained. Umbilical hernia repair refers to the procedure whereby a surgeon makes a small incision at the base of a patient's belly button and pushes the loop of bowel back into the abdominal wall. Exclusion criteria were: (1) young adults > 18 years of age and (2) children with umbilical hernia who were discovered as an incidental finding while undergoing surgical procedure for another condition. Medical records for all patients identified were reviewed and abstracted. Data were compiled into The Research Electronic Data Capture Database (REDCap).

Variables extracted from medical records included date of birth, gender, age at first referral, size of defect (mm), comorbidities (any cardiac, genetic, neurological, and nephrological disorders), dates of resolution (day, month, year), incarceration, and/or strangulation, date of surgery, and any perioperative complications. The main outcome of interest was spontaneous resolution of hernia. One potential confounder is prematurity, defined as gestational age less than 37 weeks. To eliminate the potential for confounding, we excluded patients with an incidental finding of umbilical hernia from our study.

Descriptive statistics were performed for age, timing of repair, and complications. Binary logistic regression was performed to identify predictors of preoperative complications (incarceration/strangulation) and odds of spontaneous resolution of umbilical hernia, in an attempt to identify a cohort that would benefit from earlier surgical repair. A subgroup analysis was performed exclusively on patients with complications, due to the presence of effect modification between umbilical hernia and resolution of the hernia.

### The hernia-neck-ratio (HNR), a novel predictive factor for complications of umbilical hernia [^115NPva9]. World Journal of Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Umbilical hernia is a common pathology and surgical repair is advised to prevent complications in symptomatic patients. However, risk factors that predict such advert events are unknown. The aim of the study was to determine whether morphological characteristics are associated with the occurrence of complications.

Method

Retrospective review of adult patients with elective and emergent umbilical hernia repair operated from January 2004 to December 2013. The size of the hernia and the size of the neck were measured based on operative reports, ultrasound, CT or MRI images. The Hernia-Neck-Ratio (HNR) was then calculated as novel risk indicator.

Results

106 patients underwent umbilical hernia repair (70 for uncomplicated and 36 for complicated hernia) as single procedure. The median size of the hernia sac was statistically significantly smaller in the uncomplicated group (30 mm, interquartile range (IQR) 20–49 vs. 50 mm, IQR 40–71, p = 0.037). The median size of the neck was not different between both groups (15 mm, IQR 11–29 vs. 16 mm, IQR 12–21, p = 0.44). The median HNR was smaller in the uncomplicated group (1.76, IQR 1.45–2.18 vs. 3.33, IQR 2.97–3.91, p = 0.00026). Based on ROC curve analysis (area under the curve: 0.9038), a cut-off value of 2.5 was associated with 91% sensitivity and 84% specificity.

Conclusions

A novel predictive factor for complications related to umbilical hernia is proposed. The Hernia-Neck Ratio can easily be calculated. These results suggest that umbilical hernia with HNR > 2.5 should be operated, irrespective of the presence of symptoms.

### Epigastric hernias in children and the use of ultrasound in its diagnosis [^114xYSt7]. World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Results

We included 60 patients, of which 28 were females, resulting in an almost even sex ratio of 1:1.14. The median age of patients was 39 months (IQR 24–77 months). There were no differences between sexes in terms of age and body mass index (table 1).

Table 1
Demographic details of the included patients

One patient had two epigastric hernias, and another even had three epigastric hernias at different positions of the midline. Three (5%) patients had a coexisting inguinal hernia, and four (7%) had a coexisting umbilical hernia. An incisional hernia following a laparoscopic appendectomy was present in another patient. The leading symptom on presentation was pain in 18 (30%) patients, which occurred conjointly with swelling in 15 of them, while the remaining three patients had pain without visible swelling. Swelling was present in 53 (88%) patients during clinical examination, resulting in four (7%) patients who had a history of swelling that vanished spontaneously and could not be reproduced by maneuvers to increase the intra-abdominal pressure. A fascial defect was palpable in 27 (45%) patients. There was no difference in the distribution of symptoms between sexes (table 1).

### Umbilical hernia simulating recurrent carcinoid on octreoscan [^116zmV5A]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Physiologic bowel activity on In-111 octreotide imaging is commonly seen. However, on occasion, normal bowel activity may mimic lesions in the abdomen, which can be very difficult to differentiate, particularly after surgical intervention. We report a case of focal bowel activity simulating a lesion in a patient who had an In-111 octreotide scan (Octreoscan), postoperatively, looking for recurrent carcinoid. SPECT/CT demonstrated that the uptake was localized in the anterior abdomen, and corresponded to a loop of bowel within a ventral hernia at the site of surgical incision. The correlation with CT as well as the precise localization made possible by the fusion images helped avoid misinterpretation of this finding as possible recurrent carcinoid.

### Trocar site hernia after gastric sleeve [^111Kettv]. Surgical Endoscopy (2022). Medium credibility.

In our previous study on TSH after a LRYGB (laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass), all hernias were located at the umbilical trocar site. In that study several of the lateral ports were larger than 5 mm. The present study has an almost four times larger study population but otherwise similar patient characteristics, methodology and follow-up time. Although probably not highly likely, the ring to lay upon may have covered the most lateral trocar sites, preventing hernias from protrusion, and we have chosen to keep the number of TSHs without false negatives and therefore not included the one lateral TSH in the statistics. The higher incidence of TSH after gastric sleeve may be explained by that the removed stomach is retrieved through the 15 mm umbilical trocar site, possibly further enlarged due to this manipulation. This strongly indicates that a sleeve patient is more likely to develop a TSH than a LRYGB patient. That most trocar site hernias are found at the umbilicus is again striking and needs to be further addressed. The umbilical site has previously been shown to constitute a higher risk for hernia formation, as are larger trocars. One study report that excessive manipulation of the trocar site to remove specimens during surgery was an important risk factor for TSH. A randomized control trial comparing TSH incidence between a LRYGB and a gastric sleeve is necessary. Furthermore, as development of a TSH might be correlated to an insufficient closure technique, this is another matter worth further scientific evaluation. In fact, to date we do not know whether the principals of optimal closure techniques applied for open surgery is advised also for trocar incisions. In conclusion, regarding an initial trocar site in the umbilicus versus outside of the umbilicus, there should be further comparing studies on initial trocar site and the aspects of feasibility and safety in creating the site and extracting a large specimen, but also on the best closure techniques.

Incarcerated hernias

Abdominal wall hernias are another common cause of intestinal obstruction in LMICs, as loops of intestine can become trapped, incarcerated, and subsequently strangulated within these abdominal wall defects.

Umbilical hernias are especially common in Africa. Umbilical hernias can occur in 91% of children 5 years or younger and 46% of children who are 10–15-year-old. In the United States, umbilical hernias occur in 40–60% of infants and only 4% remain present after the age of 5, while the remaining spontaneously close. In general, umbilical hernias should be repaired by 5 years of age if the defect does not obliterate spontaneously. In single center studies, incarceration from an umbilical hernia can occur in 37–44% of patients presenting to the hospital with symptoms.

In Africa, inguinal hernias are present in 1–5% of children overall and in 35% of premature babies. In the United States, the condition has a similar prevalence of 1–5% in children overall and a lower prevalence at 9–11% in premature infants. Similar incidence rates exist in Asia, where inguinal hernias occur in 6.6% of males and 0.7% of females in a nationwide Taiwanese population study. Given the heightened risk of incarceration, early elective herniotomy is the treatment of choice after diagnosis of a reducible inguinal hernia.

Elective herniotomy is usually a short outpatient case and is extremely cost-effective. However, surgical backlog or compromised access to surgical care frequently prevents timely repair of these defects, which leads to a high incidence of incarcerated and strangulated hernias in LMICs. In a Nigerian study, obstructed hernias made up 14.8% of all abdominal surgical emergencies, ranking third after typhoid ileal perforation and intussusception. Inadequate surgical capacity to accommodate elective cases prevents early surgical correction of this common condition, leading to preventable morbidity that necessitates emergent repair.

INITIAL EVALUATION AND MANAGEMENT

The workup for a patient with concerns of a ventral abdominal wall or groin hernia begins with a thorough history and physical examination (Figs. 1). It is essential that the physical examination include all potential sites of abdominal wall hernia, including the groin and perineal areas, especially in patients with more vague presenting symptoms. Incarcerated hernias, especially in the groin, can be easily missed by a more superficial examination. After the diagnosis of a hernia has been made, the specific location, surgical history, associated symptoms, and patient-specific factors will help determine the appropriate next steps in management. History should focus on the duration of symptoms, prior episodes of hernia incarceration, past surgical history, and evidence of systemic signs of illness, including fever, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, or skin changes overlying the hernia. Physical examination should evaluate the location of the hernia, the size of the fascial defect, the presence of hernia incarceration, and any redness or ecchymosis of the overlying skin. For a well-defined localized fascial defect, adding imaging to the initial diagnostic workup is of unclear benefit and is not mandatory. If there are concerns for a complicated abdominal wall hernia, based on either patient factors or hernia variables, additional workup should be considered, and laboratory evaluation should be obtained to include a basic metabolic panel, complete blood count, and lactate.
The determination of the need and urgency for surgical repair will depend on multiple factors. Patients with a reducible hernia, improvement in symptoms, no evidence of complications, and an otherwise normal physical examination should be referred for outpatient surgical follow-up to discuss elective hernia repair. Patients with concern for abdominal wall hernia complications, including strangulation, intestinal obstruction, hernia incarceration, unrelieved severe pain, overlying skin changes, or evidence of systemic illness, should be seen by an acute care surgeon. Ideally, surgical evaluation should precede imaging in patients with nonreducible hernias and worrisome findings on physical examination.
Patients with an incarcerated hernia and concern for strangulation or presence of peritonitis require prompt surgical intervention, as increased time from onset of symptoms to operative intervention is associated with an increased need for bowel resection. Signs of bowel incarceration causing obstruction (nausea, vomiting, abdominal distension, and obstipation), in addition to severe pain at the hernia site, are suggestive of strangulation. Systemic signs of strangulation may include hypotension and tachycardia, with elevations in serum lactate (> 2.0 mmol/L) and white blood cell often (although not definitively) found on initial laboratory evaluation. Physical examination may also show erythema or bruising/discoloration of the skin overlying the hernia. When these findings are present, or the patient is otherwise deemed at risk for strangulation within the hernia, an emergent exploration should be undertaken, with assessment of the viability of involved bowel, reduction of the hernia, and definitive hernia repair if practical. In many cases, imaging is not required and may lead to unnecessary delay. Similar to other EGS procedures, patients requiring acute urgent operation for hernia complications are at increased risk of complication compared with their elective counterparts.
In circumstances of diagnostic uncertainty or a difficult-to-interpret examination (as can be found in obesity), imaging should be obtained to confirm the diagnosis and to evaluate for high-risk imaging features associated with strangulation. While ultrasound can be used to help with the initial diagnosis, cross-sectional imaging with computed tomography scan is preferred. Even when the diagnosis of hernia is confidently made on physical examination, computed tomography imaging can provide useful clinical information on the fascial defect size and hernia contents to evaluate for signs of intestinal obstruction or ischemia. In the absence of a high index of suspicion for strangulation, attempts should be made to reduce an incarcerated abdominal wall hernia unless it is known that the patient has had a chronically nonreducible incarcerated hernia. Acute hernia incarceration that is not reducible should prompt urgent operative intervention to reduce the hernia, evaluate for the viability of the incarcerated bowel, and repair the hernia defect.
Acutely incarcerated hernias that are reducible but have high-risk features (Table 1) on imaging or physical examination should favor urgent repair (defined as nonemergent but performed during the index admission). These features are related to the patient's presentation and imaging findings. Clinical high-risk features include persistent abdominal pain after reduction or persistent nausea/vomiting. Radiographic findings associated with a higher risk for hernia complications should be considered when determining the need for urgent surgery in patients without clear signs of strangulation. Beyond the typical signs of bowel ischemia (e.g. pneumatosis, portal venous gas, or free air), the presence of fluid within the hernia sac, a transition point of the bowel at the neck of the hernia, bowel thickening within the hernia, and inflammatory stranding in the tissue along the hernia are considered high-risk features.
While repair of a hernia on initial presentation may be ideal, patient factors or local capacity may not permit this to be reasonably performed in all settings. Patient-specific factors should be considered, including age, frailty, American Society of Anesthesia score, and preadmission anticoagulant use, as each of these variables is associated with an increased risk of complications. – Some patients with hernias that exhibit a higher risk of recurrence may be discharged but with a defined plan to repair it in the short term to minimize patients' loss of follow-up. Variables associated with a higher risk of recurrence include clinical factors and radiographic features of the hernia (Table 2). Acute onset and escalation of symptoms should be considered potential reasons to hasten repair. The need for conscious sedation to achieve a successful visceral reduction marks patients as higher risk, and they should undergo expedited repair (when performed within 4 weeks, reincarceration rates of ~2% have been reported). High-risk anatomical features include certain types of hernias with femoral and Spigelian hernias exhibiting a higher incarceration rate and need for emergent repair; therefore, these should be addressed promptly. Women with groin hernia have a higher risk of requiring emergent surgery compared with men, especially if a femoral hernia is present. The size of the fascial defect is an unreliable predictor of the need for urgent repair, but primary hernia defects between 3 and 4 cm are at higher overall risk of incarceration compared with smaller or larger defects (with a rate of 10%; odds ratio, 3.31; 95% confidence interval, 1.91–5.74; p < 0.0001). Specific measurements comparing the width of a fascial defect and the height of the hernia sack can also be used to estimate an increased risk with a "mushrooming hernia", one with a narrow neck as compared with height creating an acute angle with the abdominal wall being associated with a higher risk of requiring emergent surgery (odds ratio, 6.12; 95% confidence interval, 2.24–20.00). Similarly, a study by James et al.identified the ratio of hernia size to fascial defect (neck) as a potential aid in surgical decision-making, finding that a hernia-to-neck ratio > 2.5 predicted the need for emergent repair. Patients presenting to the ED with acute abdominal wall hernia symptoms who do not have an indication for urgent surgery are at high risk of being lost to follow-up. A prior multicenter study of patients with an ED visit for hernia-related symptoms showed that over 50% did not follow up in the outpatient clinic, with 20% returning to the ED with additional hernia-related complaints. Considering socioeconomic factors and health care disparities to determine the need for operative intervention at the index admission will address low clinic follow-up rates and prevent future ED resource utilization. When immediate repair is not required, an effort should be made to ensure follow-up and initiate planning for definitive repair before the patient is discharged from the ED or the inpatient setting. The ability to follow-up in the outpatient clinic and access to elective, outpatient surgery should also be considered.
Nonurgent repair or repair after patient optimization prior to surgery can be pursued for symptomatic hernias without high-risk features. These patients can likely be safely discharged from the ED with elective outpatient follow-up. If modifiable patient risk factors are identified at the time of hernia diagnosis (such as smoking, need for weight loss, or control of diabetes), these should be addressed before surgery. If the hernia is deemed complex, its eventual repair should be scheduled when patient optimization has been achieved and performed by a surgeon experienced in complex abdominal wall reconstruction techniques. Prediction of the need for component separation can be a subjective determination or made in various ways using data from cross-sectional imaging comparing aspects of the hernia to the remaining abdominal wall. Watchful waiting and outpatient follow-up may be considered for asymptomatic ventral, inguinal, and umbilical hernias found incidentally on imaging. While these have a reasonably high rate of requiring an eventual repair, it is likely safe to monitor these hernias after the patient has received counseling on monitoring the hernia for symptoms in the future.

### Umbilical paracentesis for acute hernia reduction in cirrhotic patients [^112Uqi17]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Emergent repair of umbilical hernias in cirrhotic patients is associated with a high risk for morbidity and mortality. We propose a new technique, umbilical paracentesis, for reduction of incarcerated hernias in the patient with ascites. Under ultrasound guidance, removal of ascitic fluid from the umbilical hernia sac can reduce the local pressure and thereby allow for easy hernia reduction, thus avoiding the need for an emergent operation.

Umbilical hernias at the trocar site are classified into three distinct types. The first type is early-onset, which typically manifests immediately postoperatively, often due to surgical technique. The second type, late-onset hernia, occurs several months after the surgical procedure. The third type is characterized by the protrusion of intra-abdominal contents, such as the intestine and/or omentum. In studies with shorter follow-up durations, the incidence of umbilical hernias was reported to be low, ranging from 0.18 to 2.8%. However, with extended follow-up periods, the incidence increases, with the time to occurrence ranging from 9 to 70 months, with a median of 42.4 months. To more accurately assess the true risk of incisional hernias, a follow-up period of at least 3 years is recommended. Longer follow-up periods have shown an increased incidence of 11.7–12.1%. Several factors have been identified as contributing to the increased incidence of umbilical hernias, including high body mass index (BMI), a prior history of umbilical hernia, incision length greater than 5 cm, and prolonged operative time. In patients undergoing laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy, the incidence of umbilical hernias was as high as 21.5%, with a mean follow-up period of 37 months. This particular study, with only a 30-day follow-up and no occurrences, showed results consistent with those of a previous study. Thus, short follow-up periods may only detect early-onset hernias. Further studies with extended follow-up are warranted to evaluate the long-term outcomes and potential risk factors associated with umbilical hernias.

### WSES guidelines for emergency repair of complicated abdominal wall hernias [^114umDmc]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

A large number of abdominal hernias require emergency surgery. However, these procedures are associated with poor prognoses and a higher rate of post-operative complications.

A World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) Consensus Conference was held in Bergamo on July 2013, during the 2 nd Congress of the World Society of Emergency Surgery with the goal of defining recommendations for emergency repair of abdominal wall hernias in adults. This document represents the executive summary of the consensus conference approved by a WSES expert panel.

Abdominal hernias may be classified as groin hernias (femoral and inguinal) and ventral hernias (umbilical, epigastric, spigelian and incisional).

An incarcerated hernia may be defined as a hernia in which the contents have become irreducible due to a narrow opening in the abdominal wall or adhesions within the cavity. Intestinal obstruction can complicate an incarcerated hernia. In contrast, a strangulated hernia is one in which the blood supply to the contents of the hernia (eg omentum, bowel) s becomes compromised.

Strangulated hernias remain a significant challenge, as they are sometimes difficult to diagnose purely by physical examination yet require urgent surgical intervention. Early surgical intervention of a strangulated hernia with obstruction is crucial as delayed diagnosis can lead to bowel resection with longer recovery and its attendant complications. Strangulated hernias can have serious deleterious effects such as, bowel obstruction, bacterial translocation, and intestinal wall necrosis (potentially resulting in bowel perforation). It poses a significant risk to emergency hernia repair, as there is an increased incidence of surgical field contamination, leading to high rates of post-operative infection and probably recurrence.

Bacteria inherently colonize all surgical wounds, but only a fraction of these contaminates ultimately lead to infection. In most patients infection does not occur because innate host defences are able to eliminate microbes at the surgical site. However, there is some evidence that the implantation of foreign materials, such as prosthetic mesh, may lead to a decreased threshold for infection.

Enrollment criteria for the optimization clinic included 61 patients (37.0%) with a BMI of 40 or higher, 43 patients (26.1%) with active tobacco use, and 39 patients (23.6%) aged 75 years or older (Table 2). Sixteen patients had more than 1 risk factor of eligibility for the program. In the absence of these 3 specific criteria, an additional 6 patients (3.6%) underwent physician-directed referral based on the presence of a medical history and/or multiple comorbidities that were judged to be sufficiently complicated to potentially affect surgical repair. The median (range) follow-up was 197 (39–378) days. Of the 165 patients evaluated for hernia repair, 115 (69.7%) had ventral or incisional hernias, and 44 (26.7%) had umbilical hernias. Although the telephone triage was meant to exclude groin hernias, 6 patients (3.6%) had femoral or inguinal hernias but remained enrolled in the optimization clinic and were included in the final analysis.

### Multidetector CT of expected findings and early postoperative complications after current techniques for ventral hernia repair [^1146Pme6]. Insights Into Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

Overview of surgical techniques

Broadly defined as "a protrusion of tissues through a defect of the anterior abdominal wall", ventral hernias represent a highly prevalent but heterogeneous problem in general surgery. The European Hernia Society (EHS) categorizes abdominal wall hernias as either primary or incisional. The former group includes midline (epigastric and umbilical) and lateral (spigelian and lumbar) hernias, which are classified according to their size (< 2 cm, > 4 cm, or intermediate). Congenital or acquired umbilical hernias represent the most common primary hernias.

An incisional hernia is defined as "any abdominal wall gap with or without a bulge in the area of a postoperative scar perceptible or palpable by clinical examination or imaging from incisional hernias". Incisional hernias develop after any abdominal surgery, with an incidence approaching 20%, and are increasingly encountered because of increased life expectancy and the high prevalence of risk factors such as obesity and diabetes. Recurrences after repair of primary hernias fall in the incisional group.

Approach to the patient with ASBO

An algorithm for the diagnostic and therapeutic approach to the patient with ASBO is presented in Fig. 2. The initial diagnosis of ASBO is of utmost importance. Failure to diagnose or having a delayed diagnosis represents 70% of malpractice claims in ASBO.

Fig. 2
Algorithm to diagnosis and treatment of ASBO

The primary goals in the initial evaluation of patients in whom adhesive small bowel obstruction is suspected are:
Differentiating between adhesive small bowel obstruction and other causes of bowel obstruction
Assessing the need for urgent surgical exploration
Identifying and preventing complications from bowel obstruction

History taking and physical examination

History taking in a patient suspected for ASBO includes assessment of potential causes of bowel obstruction (previous operations, radiotherapy) and nutritional status. Signs of dehydration should also be assessed. Traditionally, ASBO is clinically diagnosed in a patient with intermittent colicky abdominal pain, distention, and nausea (with or without vomiting), with or without absence of stools. Although diagnosis of small bowel obstruction is fairly certain in a patient in whom all of these symptoms are present, there are some specific pitfalls that can result in delayed or misdiagnosis of bowel obstruction upon initial presentation. In patients with incomplete obstruction, watery diarrhea may be present. The presence of watery diarrhea can cause an episode of ASBO to be mistaken for gastro-enteritis. Stools might also be present in patients with a relatively high obstruction who are admitted early after onset of symptoms. Moreover, not all of these symptoms may be present, especially in the elderly in whom pain is often less prominent.

During physical examination, signs of peritonitis that might reveal strangulation or ischemia should be evaluated. Differential diagnostic considerations that can be assessed during physical examination include the presence of any abdominal wall or groin hernias. The evaluation of ASBO by history taking and physical examination has a low sensitivity for detecting bowel strangulation and ischemia. Sensitivity of physical examination for detection of strangulation is only 48%, even in experienced hands.

### Predictors of spontaneous resolution of umbilical hernia in children [^115Z8F5B]. World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pediatric umbilical hernias affect approximately 10%–30% of live births annually. This rate decreases between 2% and 10% after 1 year, with nearly 90% umbilical hernias resolving spontaneously within the first few years of life. Presently, expectant management, or watchful waiting, is the current medical guideline for monitoring umbilical hernias until children reach 4–5 years of age. Complications that may occur include incarceration and strangulation. The rate of these complications is quite low (0.16%–0.81%). There is no consensus regarding appropriate timing of surgical repair or indications for surgery by any of the major pediatric associations (eg, Canadian Association of Pediatric Surgery, American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Pediatric Surgical Association or the American College of Surgeons). A better understanding of the natural history of uncomplicated umbilical hernias, management and treatment outcomes is required. Additionally, there is minimal evidence on risk factors affecting the likelihood of spontaneous resolution in children. An in-depth analysis of various parameters influencing clinical outcomes, such as spontaneous resolution, has not been elucidated extensively, or at our institution. Therefore, the aim of this study was to conduct a retrospective chart review on the surgical outcomes of all patients with umbilical hernia treated at the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario (CHEO), Canada. The objective was to describe factors of spontaneous resolution, clinical outcomes, such as rate of recurrence, and complications.

### Poor man's NOTES: can it be a good approach for adhesiolysis? A first case report with video demonstration [^115DJYNk]. Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology (2014). Low credibility.

Study Objective

To show that in selected cases transvaginal NOTES can be a frugally innovative approach for adhesiolysis and that it can be performed in a low-cost setting.

Design

Step-by-step explanation of the technique using videos and pictures (educative video).

Patients and Measurements

A 51-year old (para 2, gravida 2) presented with meso- and hypogastric pain. Two years before, an umbilical hernia had been repaired using a Proceed Ventral Patch mesh. The diagnosis of pain caused by adhesions was made, and laparoscopic adhesiolysis was planned. On ultrasound, a small left ovarian fibroma was visualized. Because of the suspected umbilical location of the adhesions, we decided to use a transvaginal NOTES approach to perform adhesiolysis and left adnexectomy. Pathological examination confirmed a small benign papillary serous adenofibroma of the ovary.

Interventions

A transvaginal NOTES approach to perform adhesiolysis combined with left adnexectomy using only standard reusable laparoscopic instruments and a low-cost self-constructed NOTES port.

Main Results

The procedure and postoperative recovery were uneventful. No minor or major complications occurred. The patient has been cured of her pain.

Conclusion

Transvaginal NOTES is a novel approach that requires further validation. This case report shows that transvaginal NOTES can be used to perform adhesiolysis for abdominal pain and that it can be performed in a low-cost setting without the need for expensive ports or disposable instruments.

### Frequency of potentially avoidable surgical referrals for asymptomatic umbilical hernias in children [^115Zw2aS]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The American Association of Pediatrics released guidelines in 2019 recommending delay of surgical referral in children with asymptomatic umbilical hernias until 4–5 y of age. The purpose of this study was to assess contemporary rates of potentially avoidable referrals in this cohort of children, and to assess whether rates have decreased following guideline release.

Methods

Retrospective analysis of umbilical hernias referrals evaluated at a single pediatric surgery clinic from October 2014 to August 2021. Potentially avoidable referrals (PAR) were defined as asymptomatic, non-enlarging umbilical hernia referrals in a child 3 y of age or younger without a history of incarceration. Referral indication, disposition following clinic visit, and rates of PAR were compared before and after guideline release.

Results

A total of 803 umbilical hernia referrals were evaluated, of which 48% were in children 3 y of age or younger at time of evaluation ("early" referrals). 33% of all referrals and 68% of early referrals were categorized as a PAR, and rates were similar before and after guideline release (all referrals: 32% versus 33%, P = 0.94; early referrals: 68% versus 67%, P = 0.94). Of the 333 early referrals who were managed expectantly per guideline recommendations, 2 (0.6%) developed incarceration which was managed with successful reduction and interval repair.

Conclusions

One-third of all referrals for umbilical hernia evaluation are potentially avoidable, and this rate did not change following release of American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines. Aligning expectations between surgeons and referring providers through improved education and guideline dissemination may reduce avoidable visits, lost caregiver productivity, and exposure to potentially avoidable surgery.

### Provincial review of adherence to age-specific guidelines for umbilical hernia repair and trends in management [^111TjPH9]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Umbilical hernia (UH) is a common pediatric condition, for which delaying surgical repair for asymptomatic UH until after age 3 is recommended due to a high incidence of spontaneous closure. We aimed to determine the adherence to guidelines, rate of urgent surgical repair, outcomes, cost, and interinstitutional referral patterns of UH repair in the province of Quebec (Canada).

Methods

This was a population-based retrospective cohort study of children 28 days to 17 years old who underwent UH repair between 2010 and 2020 using health administrative databases. Children who had multiple procedures, or prolonged peri-operative stays were excluded. Early repair was defined as elective surgery at or under age 3.

Results

Of the 3215 children, 1744 (54.2%) were female, and 1872 (58.2%) were treated in a tertiary children's hospital. Guidelines were respected for 2853 out of 3215 children (89.7%). Patients living over 75 km from their treating hospitals (OR 2.36, 95% CI 1.33–4.16, P < 0.01), with pre-existing comorbidities (OR, 2.82; 95% CI, 1.96–4.05; P < 0.001), or being treated in a tertiary center (OR 2.10, 95% CI 1.45–3.03, P < 0.001) had a higher risk of early repair. Repair at or under age 3 and urgent surgery were associated with significant cost increases of 411$ (P < 0.001) and 558$ (P < 0.001), respectively.

Conclusion

Quebec has a high rate of adherence to age-specific guidelines for UH repair. Future research should explore factors that explain transfers into tertiary centers, and the extent to which these reflect efficient use of resources.

### Umbilical hernia repair: overview of approaches and review of literature [^116vdZk1]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Umbilical hernias are ubiquitous, and surgery is indicated in symptomatic patients. Umbilical hernia defects can range from small (< 1 cm) to very large/complex hernias, and treatment options should be tailored to the clinical situation. Open, laparoscopic, and robotic options exist for repair, with each having its advantages and disadvantages. In general, mesh should be used for repair, because it has been shown to decrease recurrence rates, even in small hernias. Although outcomes are generally favorable after umbilical hernia repairs, some patients have chronic complaints that are mostly related to recurrences.

KQ2 — management of asymptomatic type II, III, or IV hiatal hernia: There was no evidence identified in the literature of truly asymptomatic patients being managed operatively or with surveillance, so given there was no evidence on which to base a recommendation, the panel formulated a recommendation based on expert opinion that is additionally limited by the lack of patient input. The management of the patient with an asymptomatic type II, III, or IV hiatal hernia is challenging given the poor evidence base, and the first step is to ensure the patient is truly asymptomatic.

### Prenatal diagnosis and risk stratification of congenital diaphragmatic hernia [^1112USJV]. World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Antenatal counseling

Following the initial diagnosis of CDH, families begin a long emotional journey of dealing with an unknown and the subsequent trajectory is characterized by clinical parameters that may not be available at the first evaluation. Thus, avoidance of speculation on severity and outcome should be avoided with prompt referral to a CDH specialist center to minimize stress and the uncertainty burdening the expectant parents. The treatment center should have expertise in prenatal imaging modalities, including obstetric US, fetal echocardiography, and fetal MRI. In both isolated and non-isolated CDH, patients should be offered comprehensive genetic evaluation. Sufficient and thorough information is crucial to guide families in making informed decisions. Families should be provided with an understanding of the fetal condition, neonatal risks, and immediate and long-term outcomes. This should include center-specific outcomes, as each center has its own unique practices and experiences. The integration of a racially and ethnically diverse prenatal and postnatal team in both counseling and care results in a multidisciplinary care model that has been proven to improve survival outcomes and the overall satisfaction of these families with the experience of care.CDH centers of excellence include a unique infrastructure with collaboration between fetal medicine, maternal medicine, pediatric surgery, neonatology, pediatric subspecialists, and nursing. The need for care coordinators, social workers, and access to psychosocial support should also be part of the standard of care in CDH and other complex prenatal diagnosis. While most neonates do not benefit from ECLS, prenatally detected severe CDH cases show a significant survival benefit with ELCS use. Additionally, center experience and high case volume play a major role in improving outcomes. If ECLS is not available at the planned birthing site of a high-risk CDH fetus, then transfer to a delivery center that can offer ECLS must be initiated. Risks and benefits of FETO should be included in the counseling and management options when discussing tailored treatment plans with families. If antenatal intervention is not provided at the treatment center, referral to a level III fetal center should be a consideration in cases which meet criteria. Critical to antenatal counseling is the availability of center-specific outcomes. These require multidisciplinary and long-term surveillance of patients with CDH and transparency in reporting. Multidisciplinary clinics should include pediatric surgery, pulmonary medicine, gastroenterology, nutrition, and developmental specialists to address the long-term sequelae of CDH beyond the delivery unit. Parents may choose to pursue expectant management, fetal therapy, pregnancy termination, active neonatal care, or palliation. Respecting parental preferences through unconditional acceptance of their choices and needs is the duty of the treatment center, regardless of the management approach selected.

### An unusual case of umbilical hernia rupture with evisceration [^1116nCY7]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Umbilical hernia is a common pediatric diagnosis for which the initial management is usually nonoperative. The high incidence of spontaneous closure and the infrequency of complications in the first few years of life justify this conservative management strategy. The authors present a case of a 5-month-old girl with a history of prematurity and prolonged ventilatory support, who subsequently experienced bowel evisceration via a previously uncomplicated umbilical hernia.

### Guidelines on the management of ascites in cirrhosis [^114WKJzU]. Gut (2021). Medium credibility.

Management of umbilical hernia in patients with ascites

In the cirrhotic patient, the incidence of abdominal wall hernia is 16% and reaches 24% in the presence of ascites; more than half of these are umbilical hernias. These progressively enlarge and are prone to complications, including ulceration of the overlying skin, incarceration, strangulation, and rupture. Non-operative management of complicated hernias with antibiotics and dressing changes might result in mortality rates in the range of 60–88%. On the other hand, hernia repair in cirrhosis has often been avoided due to high postoperative morbidity and mortality. Emergency surgery (OR = 10.32, 95% CI 3.66 to 47.82), Child-Pugh-Turcotte class C (OR = 5.52, 1.67 to 32.45), American Society of Anaesthesiologists (ASA) score ≥ 3 (OR = 8.65, 3.65 to 87.23) and MELD score ≥ 20 (OR = 2.15, 2.71 to 32.68) are associated with mortality.

A recent retrospective series of 102 patients, who underwent surgical repair of the umbilical hernia in the presence of ascites, included 45 patients having emergency surgery (24 with incarceration, 12 with rupture of the hernia sac, and nine with skin ulceration or necrosis). Morbidity and mortality rates of 37.2% and 3.9%, respectively, were observed. Optimising management of ascites, including LVP and TIPSS perioperatively, could reduce the risk of wound dehiscence and recurrence of hernia.

Recommendations

Suitability and timing of surgical repair of umbilical hernia should be considered in discussion with the patient and multidisciplinary team involving physicians, surgeons and anaesthetists. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: strong)

### Surgical management of umbilical endometrioma within an umbilical hernia [^115VzEte]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

We present a case of full thickness umbilical endometriosis presenting in an umbilical hernia sac in a patient who had had two prior myomectomy procedures through a Pfannenstiel incision with breaching of the endometrium. Having failed medical management, the lesion was successfully surgically removed with a 2-year recurrence-free interval to date. The surgery, however, was complicated by a surgical site infection necessitating readmission.

Umbilical endometriosis accounts for 0.5–1.0% of all endometriosis and can appear either as a primary lesion in the absence of surgery, also known as Villar's node, or as a secondary lesion arising from subsequent scar tissue after abdominal procedures. Abdominal wall endometriosis is reported to have rates of pelvic endometriosis ranging from 13% to 34%, but the exact rate is unknown since the peritoneum is not routinely evaluated during the workup or management of those cases.

Several theories explaining the pathogenesis of endometriosis exist, including both local implantation via refluxed endometrial cells entering the abdominal cavity through the tubesand dissemination through lymphovascular channels. Although overall a rare condition, patients with obstetric surgical history such as caesarean sections are at risk for umbilical endometriomas. It is therefore conceivable that a breach of the endometrium during her two myomectomy procedures may have caused seeding of the umbilical hernia in our patient.

Umbilical endometrioma must be differentiated from ventral hernia, suture granulomas, abscess, cyst or lipoma. The initial management is therefore often surgical, especially if there is no known history of pelvic endometriosis. When the diagnosis is suspected, on the other hand, some investigators have attempted medical management for those tumours. However, medical management has been infrequently reported, and the studies that investigated medical management have had small sample sizes and did not include long-term follow-up. Additionally, there is not much data specifically comparing medical and surgical management outcomes, which begs the question of whether the role of hormonal therapy should be reserved for postoperative long-term symptom control.
