## Question

Effects of long term pregablin use

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the effects of long-term pregabalin use. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "long-term" means in the evidence base and how to define it. Then, I should verify the key outcome domains to cover: efficacy, safety, tolerability, and special populations. Next, I will appraise the quality and hierarchy of evidence, extract quantitative data where available, and synthesize by domain. After that, I need to flag uncertainties and gaps, and finally translate this into practical clinical recommendations with monitoring and risk mitigation strategies.

> Let me first confirm the scope and definitions so I don't misinterpret the literature. "Long-term" in pregabalin studies varies, but the most informative data extend to 12 months, with some open-label extensions and observational cohorts reaching 1–2 years; randomized trials are typically 8–16 weeks, so I should distinguish short-term RCTs from longer-term open-label and observational data when drawing conclusions [^116oYiiq] [^117GXpQ1] [^111cQL5i].

> I will now examine efficacy across indications, starting with neuropathic pain. Wait, let me verify the magnitude and durability of benefit. In fibromyalgia, enriched-enrollment randomized withdrawal trials show that about 40% maintain therapeutic response at 13–26 weeks on pregabalin versus 20% on placebo, with an NNT around 5, and classic RCTs show modest but consistent benefits for 30–50% pain reduction; in painful diabetic neuropathy, Cochrane data demonstrate clinically meaningful pain reduction with NNTs around 4–6 for substantial benefit, and these effects are reproducible across multiple trials, though durability beyond 6–12 months is less certain and relies on extension data [^116oYiiq] [^1174DjWC] [^1125AG5E].

> Hold on, I should verify epilepsy outcomes separately because the clinical question differs. For drug-resistant focal epilepsy, add-on pregabalin doubles the odds of a 50% seizure reduction versus placebo, with a clear dose–response up to 600 mg/day; however, most trials are 12 weeks or less, so long-term maintenance of effect is inferred from open-label extensions rather than confirmed in long-term RCTs, and comparative effectiveness versus other AEDs varies by study [^115Mwm5x] [^111ZsaNx] [^112yM9TE].

> Next, I should review safety signals that emerge with chronic exposure. Weight gain is the most consistent long-term adverse effect, dose- and duration-related, averaging about 1.6 kg over 5–13 weeks and accumulating to roughly 5.2 kg in diabetics treated for at least 2 years; importantly, this occurs even without edema, and short-term trials did not show clinically meaningful HbA1c changes, though vigilance is warranted in patients with metabolic risk [^111cQL5i] [^112C6PJx] [^111LNG3G].

> I need to check cardiovascular risks, because this is an area of evolving concern. Observational data in diabetic neuropathy suggest increased risks of heart failure, myocardial infarction, stroke, DVT, and PE with long-term gabapentinoid use, with the highest signal for DVT; a recent high-quality emulation study found a higher incidence of new heart failure with pregabalin versus gabapentin, particularly in those with preexisting cardiovascular disease, so I should counsel patients with CVD risk factors accordingly while acknowledging residual confounding and the need for replication [^1148MArH] [^112mTJwx] [^1148MArH].

> Let me consider neuropsychiatric and cognitive effects, and I should double-check the strength of evidence. In healthy volunteers, 12 weeks of pregabalin at 600 mg/day produced mild, measurable cognitive decrements on executive and processing-speed tasks, and FDA labeling warns of increased suicidal ideation risk with AEDs, including pregabalin, observable as early as week 1 and persisting through 24 weeks; clinically, I should screen for mood and suicidality at initiation and during dose changes, especially in patients with psychiatric comorbidity [^1171Anw9] [^113CTKy1].

> I should confirm dependence and withdrawal risks, because these are often underrecognized. Case reports and series document withdrawal syndromes with abrupt discontinuation, including delirium, anxiety, insomnia, and autonomic symptoms; tapering over at least one week is recommended, and I need to be cautious in patients with substance use disorder or those on other CNS depressants, given misuse potential and respiratory depression risk when combined with opioids [^115NM3Zb] [^1112G3dH] [^111Dk73k].

> But wait, what about ocular effects with long-term use; I should verify that. A small observational study in fibromyalgia suggested retinal nerve fiber layer thinning with longer pregabalin exposure, which could be relevant in patients with preexisting optic nerve disease; given the low quality of evidence, I should individualize risk–benefit and consider periodic vision screening in high-risk patients rather than routine testing for all [^115RRUUW].

> Next, I should review special populations, starting with diabetes. Beyond weight gain, fluid retention and peripheral edema are more common and may exacerbate heart failure in susceptible patients; I should start low, titrate slowly, and reassess edema, blood pressure, and weight at each visit, especially if there is a history of heart failure or CKD [^111cQL5i] [^1148MArH].

> I will now examine pregnancy and reproductive safety, and I need to ensure I cite the most current guidance. Observational human data suggest a small increase in major birth defects with pregabalin exposure, without a consistent pattern, and postmarketing data indicate potential neonatal withdrawal when gabapentinoids are used with opioids near delivery; given uncertainty, I should enroll patients who become pregnant in the NAAED registry and avoid abrupt discontinuation, balancing maternal indications against potential fetal risks [^114y6qo6] [^113tUYBJ] [^1114xeCh].

> Let me think about pediatric and adolescent use, and I should confirm labeling. Pregabalin is not approved for pediatric fibromyalgia in the US, and while adolescent RCTs show some analgesic benefit, adverse effects like weight gain and somnolence are common; juvenile animal data demonstrate persistent neurobehavioral and reproductive effects at exposures near the human maximum dose, so long-term safety remains uncertain and off-label pediatric use should be exceptional and carefully monitored [^117PZ9sx] [^114njeoy] [^111U5KiL].

> Hold on, I should verify the strength and limitations of the evidence so I don't overstate conclusions. Much of the long-term safety and durability data come from open-label extensions and observational studies, which are vulnerable to attrition, confounding, and industry sponsorship; head-to-head, long-term RCTs are sparse, and many epilepsy and pain trials are 12 weeks or less, limiting inference about persistence of benefit or cumulative harms beyond a year [^116oYiiq] [^115Mwm5x] [^117GXpQ1].

> Next, I should review practical prescribing and monitoring to mitigate risks. Start low, go slow titration with weekly increases toward 300–600 mg/day as tolerated improves adherence and reduces CNS adverse effects; counsel on driving risk, alcohol avoidance, and fall risk, especially in older adults; monitor weight, edema, blood pressure, mood, and vision symptoms; and plan a gradual taper if discontinuing, with closer follow-up in patients with renal impairment, cardiovascular disease, or substance use disorder [^113t8oU2] [^114MZMjC] [^1112G3dH].

> In summary, I need to ensure the synthesis is balanced. Long-term pregabalin use maintains clinically meaningful benefit for a subset of patients with fibromyalgia and neuropathic pain, with durable pain control in open-label extensions, while the most prominent long-term risks are weight gain, fluid retention with potential cardiovascular consequences, neurocognitive effects, and withdrawal syndromes if stopped abruptly; careful patient selection, dose titration, and proactive monitoring are essential, and the decision to continue beyond 6–12 months should be reassessed periodically against evolving risk–benefit and alternative therapies [^116oYiiq] [^117GXpQ1] [^111cQL5i] [^1148MArH].

---

Long-term pregabalin use is associated with **modest weight gain** (average ~5 kg after 2 years in diabetics) [^111cQL5i], **peripheral edema**, and **dose-related CNS effects** (dizziness, somnolence, cognitive slowing) that often improve with dose adjustment [^113t8oU2]. Serious adverse effects are uncommon but include **suicidal ideation** [^113CTKy1], **respiratory depression** (especially with opioids) [^111Dk73k], and **heart failure exacerbation** [^115pi6hc]; long-term cardiovascular risks (DVT, PE, MI) may be increased in diabetic patients [^1148MArH]. Dependence and withdrawal can occur with abrupt cessation; taper slowly [^115NM3Zb]. Regular monitoring of weight, edema, mood, and renal function is recommended, with dose adjustments for renal impairment [^114njeoy].

---

## Common long-term adverse effects

### Weight gain and metabolic effects

- **Weight gain**: Dose- and duration-related; ~9% gain ≥ 7% body weight at 14 weeks, averaging 1.6 kg in diabetics and ~5.2 kg after 2 years [^111cQL5i] [^112C6PJx].
- **Metabolic impact**: No consistent HbA1c worsening in diabetics, but weight gain may complicate glycemic control [^111cQL5i] [^1125t5pR].

---

### Peripheral edema

Peripheral edema is **common and dose-related** [^1138suP5]; risk is higher with diabetes or concomitant NSAIDs [^notfound].

---

### Central nervous system effects

- **Dizziness and somnolence**: Very common (~30% and ~23%); often transient and dose-related [^116XGDBb] [^116csQsW].
- **Cognitive effects**: Mild deficits in memory, attention, and processing speed; usually reversible with dose reduction [^1171Anw9].
- **Mood and psychiatric effects**: Small increased risk of suicidal ideation; monitor mood, especially with psychiatric comorbidity [^113CTKy1].

---

## Serious long-term adverse effects

### Cardiovascular risks

Heart failure may be **exacerbated**, particularly in patients with preexisting disease [^112mTJwx]. Observational data in diabetic neuropathy suggest increased risks of DVT, PE, MI, and stroke with long-term use; confirmatory studies are needed [^1148MArH] [^113JCu54].

---

### Renal effects

Renal function should be **monitored** because pregabalin is renally cleared; dose adjust for impairment to reduce toxicity [^114njeoy].

---

### Dependence and withdrawal

Dependence and withdrawal can occur with **abrupt cessation**; taper over ≥ 1 week to mitigate anxiety, insomnia, nausea, and delirium [^115NM3Zb] [^1112G3dH].

---

## Long-term efficacy and tolerance

Efficacy is **sustained** for neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia in open-label extensions up to 1 year, though some patients lose response over time [^117GXpQ1] [^116oYiiq]. Tolerance is not well defined; some patients require dose escalation, but true pharmacologic tolerance is uncommon [^112yM9TE].

---

## Special populations and considerations

| **Population** | **Key considerations** |
|-|-|
| Elderly | Higher risk of falls, cognitive impairment, and renal impairment; use lower doses and monitor closely [^114njeoy] |
| Pregnancy | Limited data; potential small increase in major birth defects; weigh risks/benefits and enroll in registry if used [^114y6qo6] |
| Renal impairment | Dose adjustment required; monitor renal function regularly [^114njeoy] |

---

## Clinical monitoring and management strategies

- **Regular monitoring**: Track weight, edema, mood, and renal function; reassess benefit–risk at 3–6 month intervals.
- **Dose optimization**: Titrate to the lowest effective dose to minimize adverse effects [^116t5N1B].
- **Patient education**: Counsel on gradual tapering, avoidance of CNS depressants, and reporting mood or vision changes [^114MZMjC].
- **Alternative therapies**: Consider duloxetine, TCAs, or nonpharmacologic options if adverse effects limit use [^116t5N1B].

---

Long-term pregabalin use is generally well tolerated with manageable risks; **weight gain, edema, and CNS effects** are common, while serious harms are rare but require vigilance. Individualized dosing, regular monitoring, and patient education optimize outcomes.

### Pregabalin for neuropathic pain in adults [^111dyx2h]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

This review updates part of an earlier Cochrane Review titled "Pregabalin for acute and chronic pain in adults", and considers only neuropathic pain (pain from damage to nervous tissue). Antiepileptic drugs have long been used in pain management. Pregabalin is an antiepileptic drug used in management of chronic pain conditions.

Objectives

To assess the analgesic efficacy and adverse effects of pregabalin for chronic neuropathic pain in adults.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase for randomised controlled trials from January 2009 to April 2018, online clinical trials registries, and reference lists.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised, double-blind trials of two weeks' duration or longer, comparing pregabalin (any route of administration) with placebo or another active treatment for neuropathic pain, with participant-reported pain assessment.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed trial quality and biases. Primary outcomes were: at least 30% pain intensity reduction over baseline; much or very much improved on the Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) Scale (moderate benefit); at least 50% pain intensity reduction; or very much improved on PGIC (substantial benefit). We calculated risk ratio (RR) and number needed to treat for an additional beneficial (NNTB) or harmful outcome (NNTH). We assessed the quality of the evidence using GRADE.

Main Results

We included 45 studies lasting 2 to 16 weeks, with 11,906 participants - 68% from 31 new studies. Oral pregabalin doses of 150 mg, 300 mg, and 600 mg daily were compared with placebo. Postherpetic neuralgia, painful diabetic neuropathy, and mixed neuropathic pain predominated (85% of participants). High risk of bias was due mainly to small study size (nine studies), but many studies had unclear risk of bias, mainly due to incomplete outcome data, size, and allocation concealment. Postherpetic neuralgia: More participants had at least 30% pain intensity reduction with pregabalin 300 mg than with placebo (50% vs 25%; RR 2.1 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.6 to 2.6); NNTB 3.9 (3.0 to 5.6); 3 studies, 589 participants, moderate-quality evidence), and more had at least 50% pain intensity reduction (32% vs 13%; RR 2.5 (95% CI 1.9 to 3.4); NNTB 5.3 (3.9 to 8.1); 4 studies, 713 participants, moderate-quality evidence). More participants had at least 30% pain intensity reduction with pregabalin 600 mg than with placebo (62% vs 24%; RR 2.5 (95% CI 2.0 to 3.2); NNTB 2.7 (2.2 to 3.7); 3 studies, 537 participants, moderate-quality evidence), and more had at least 50% pain intensity reduction (41% vs 15%; RR 2.7 (95% CI 2.0 to 3.5); NNTB 3.9 (3.1 to 5.5); 4 studies, 732 participants, moderate-quality evidence). Somnolence and dizziness were more common with pregabalin than with placebo (moderate-quality evidence): somnolence 300 mg 16% versus 5.5%, 600 mg 25% versus 5.8%; dizziness 300 mg 29% versus 8.1%, 600 mg 35% versus 8.8%. Painful diabetic neuropathy: More participants had at least 30% pain intensity reduction with pregabalin 300 mg than with placebo (47% vs 42%; RR 1.1 (95% CI 1.01 to 1.2); NNTB 22 (12 to 200); 8 studies, 2320 participants, moderate-quality evidence), more had at least 50% pain intensity reduction (31% vs 24%; RR 1.3 (95% CI 1.2 to 1.5); NNTB 22 (12 to 200); 11 studies, 2931 participants, moderate-quality evidence), and more had PGIC much or very much improved (51% vs 30%; RR 1.8 (95% CI 1.5 to 2.0); NNTB 4.9 (3.8 to 6.9); 5 studies, 1050 participants, moderate-quality evidence). More participants had at least 30% pain intensity reduction with pregabalin 600 mg than with placebo (63% vs 52%; RR 1.2 (95% CI 1.04 to 1.4); NNTB 9.6 (5.5 to 41); 2 studies, 611 participants, low-quality evidence), and more had at least 50% pain intensity reduction (41% vs 28%; RR 1.4 (95% CI 1.2 to 1.7); NNTB 7.8 (5.4 to 14); 5 studies, 1015 participants, low-quality evidence). Somnolence and dizziness were more common with pregabalin than with placebo (moderate-quality evidence): somnolence 300 mg 11% versus 3.1%, 600 mg 15% versus 4.5%; dizziness 300 mg 13% versus 3.8%, 600 mg 22% versus 4.4%. Mixed or unclassified post-traumatic neuropathic pain: More participants had at least 30% pain intensity reduction with pregabalin 600 mg than with placebo (48% vs 36%; RR 1.2 (1.1 to 1.4); NNTB 8.2 (5.7 to 15); 4 studies, 1367 participants, low-quality evidence), and more had at least 50% pain intensity reduction (34% vs 20%; RR 1.5 (1.2 to 1.9); NNTB 7.2 (5.4 to 11); 4 studies, 1367 participants, moderate-quality evidence). Somnolence (12% vs 3.9%) and dizziness (23% vs 6.2%) were more common with pregabalin. Central neuropathic pain: More participants had at least 30% pain intensity reduction with pregabalin 600 mg than with placebo (44% vs 28%; RR 1.6 (1.3 to 2.0); NNTB 5.9 (4.1 to 11); 3 studies, 562 participants, low-quality evidence) and at least 50% pain intensity reduction (26% vs 15%; RR 1.7 (1.2 to 2.3); NNTB 9.8 (6.0 to 28); 3 studies, 562 participants, low-quality evidence). Somnolence (32% vs 11%) and dizziness (23% vs 8.6%) were more common with pregabalin. Other neuropathic pain conditions: Studies show no evidence of benefit for 600 mg pregabalin in HIV neuropathy (2 studies, 674 participants, moderate-quality evidence) and limited evidence of benefit in neuropathic back pain or sciatica, neuropathic cancer pain, or polyneuropathy. Serious adverse events, all conditions: Serious adverse events were no more common with placebo than with pregabalin 300 mg (3.1% vs 2.6%; RR 1.2 (95% CI 0.8 to 1.7); 17 studies, 4112 participants, high-quality evidence) or pregabalin 600 mg (3.4% vs 3.4%; RR 1.1 (95% CI 0.8 to 1.5); 16 studies, 3995 participants, high-quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Evidence shows efficacy of pregabalin in postherpetic neuralgia, painful diabetic neuralgia, and mixed or unclassified post-traumatic neuropathic pain, and absence of efficacy in HIV neuropathy; evidence of efficacy in central neuropathic pain is inadequate. Some people will derive substantial benefit with pregabalin; more will have moderate benefit, but many will have no benefit or will discontinue treatment. There were no substantial changes since the 2009 review.

### Defining success in clinical trials – profiling pregabalin, the newest AED [^112yM9TE]. European Journal of Neurology (2005). Low credibility.

The efficacy and safety of pregabalin as adjunctive therapy for patients with partial epilepsy with or without secondary generalization has been established by four randomized, 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials (n = 1396) and four long-term open-label studies (n = 1480). Patients in the three fixed-dose trials were ≥ 12 years of age, had ≥ 6 partial seizures and no 4-week seizure-free period during the 8-week baseline period. Seventy-three per cent of patients were taking ≥ 2 concomitant antiepileptic drugs. Responder rates across the effective doses (150–600 mg/day) ranged from 14% to 51% and demonstrated a significant dose-response relationship. The most common adverse events were central nervous system related, generally mild or moderate, transient, and tended to be dose related. The fourth placebo-controlled trial compared a fixed dose of pregabalin 600 mg/day with a flexible-dose regimen (150–600 mg/day). Responder rates were greater for both the fixed dose (45.3%, P < 0.001) and flexible dose (31.3%, P < 0.001) when compared with placebo (11.0%). Compared with the fixed-dose group, the flexible-dose patients had a lower incidence of adverse events and study discontinuations. In long-term open-label trials, the efficacy of pregabalin was maintained with respect to 50% responder rates suggesting no obvious tolerance developing over 2 years. Seizure-free rates were 8.9% and 5.8% for the last 6 months and 1 year of pregabalin treatment, respectively. Long-term open-label pregabalin treatment was well tolerated.

### Temporal analysis of pain responders and common adverse events: when do these first appear following treatment with pregabalin [^1124Yi6s]. Journal of Pain Research (2015). Low credibility.

This study aimed to investigate the treatment response over the first 6 weeks of clinical trials of flexible-dose pregabalin in all chronic pain conditions for which pregabalin is an approved treatment option to determine when patients first respond to treatment and when new AEs emerge or worsen. In these trials, it was decided on a weekly basis over the first 3–4 weeks of the trial if each patient's dose should be adjusted based on pain relief and AEs, after which patients completed the trial receiving their optimal dose. As the pregabalin dose was tailored to the patient's needs, this type of study design is a better representation of real-world clinical practice–than a fixed-dose design, used to establish, typically for regulatory purposes, an effective dosing range for a population rather than an individual.

### Pregabalin monotherapy for epilepsy [^115rxdBc]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Many people with epilepsy suffer from poorly controlled seizures, despite current antiepileptic treatments. Due to high rates of treatment resistance, there is interest in new pharmacological treatment options such as pregabalin. However, it remains unclear whether existing evidence of pregabalin is rigorous enough to support its monotherapy.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy and tolerability of pregabalin in people with epilepsy.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Epilepsy Group's Specialized Register (August 2012), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 7), MEDLINE (1946 to August week 1, 2012), EMBASE (1974 to August 2012) and the Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM) (1978 to August 2012). No language restrictions were imposed.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing pregabalin with placebo or another antiepileptic drug monotherapy for epilepsy.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors (QZ and LY) independently extracted trial data and assessed trial quality. We assessed the following outcomes: (1) time to withdrawal after randomisation; (2) time to achieve six-, 12- or 24-month remission; (3) the proportion of participants who remained seizure-free for six or more continuous months; (4) time to first seizure after randomisation; (5) validated quality of life measures; (6) health economic outcomes; (7) adverse effects. We expressed time-to-event outcomes as hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence interval (CI), where an HR > 1 indicates an event is more likely to occur earlier on pregabalin than the comparator.

Main Results

Two short-term studies involving 753 participants met the inclusion criteria. Only one study investigated the effects of pregabalin compared with lamotrigine in patients with newly diagnosed partial seizures, and the other study investigated the effects of pregabalin compared with gabapentin in hospitalised patients with refractory partial epilepsy. There were no studies on generalised-onset tonic-clonic seizures (with or without other generalised seizure types). We found that pregabalin was inferior in comparison to lamotrigine when measuring time to withdrawal due to inadequate seizure control after dose stabilisation from randomisation: hazard ratio (HR) 4.52; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.93 to 10.60; time to achieve six-month remission after dose stabilisation from randomisation: HR 0.56; 95% CI 0.41 to 0.76; the proportion of participants who remained seizure-free for six or more continuous months: RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.87 (Europe: 0.83, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.99; Asia: RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.86; the Americas: RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.33 to 1.19); and time to first seizure after dose stabilisation from randomisation: HR 1.74; 95% CI 1.26 to 2.39. There was no significant difference in safety-related outcomes between pregabalin and lamotrigine, but more participants in the pregabalin group developed somnolence, weight increase and convulsion. Pregabalin was better than gabapentin when measuring time to withdrawal due to all reasons after randomisation: HR 0.25; 95% CI 0.11 to 0.57; and time to withdrawal due to inadequate seizure control after randomisation: HR 0.41; 95% CI 0.18 to 0.92. No significant difference was found in safety-related outcomes between pregabalin and gabapentin. But we found some limitations in the study design which may have had an influence on the results.

Authors' Conclusions

Pregabalin seems to have similar tolerability but inferior efficacy in comparison to lamotrigine for newly diagnosed partial seizures. However, considering the limitations in the study design (such as the short-term follow-up and the low initial target dose selection), the results should be interpreted with caution. The available data were too limited to draw any conclusions between pregabalin and gabapentin. The result indicated that the treatment effects were influenced by the study regions. The clinical disadvantage of pregabalin was more prominent in Asia when compared with lamotrigine. We should determine whether pregabalin has ethnic differences in the treatment of epilepsy in the future. This review does not inform any treatment policy for patients with generalized onset tonic-clonic seizures. Further long-term trials are needed to investigate the genuine effectiveness of pregabalin as monotherapy.

### Duloxetine and pregabalin: safe and effective for the long-term treatment of fibromyalgia? [^112N3qMa]. Nature Clinical Practice: Neurology (2008). Medium credibility.

This Practice Point commentary discusses the first two trials of long-term drug treatment in fibromyalgia. In Russell et al.'s study, 33% of patients receiving 6-month treatment with 60 mg/day duloxetine responded to therapy; the number needed to treat was seven. In the three treatment arms, 15% (60 mg/day duloxetine), 27% (120 mg/day duloxetine) and 13% (placebo) of patients discontinued treatment because of adverse events (the most common being nausea [24%] and fatigue [14%]). In Crofford et al.'s study, 32% of patients who received pregabalin had loss of therapeutic response, compared with 61% of patients treated with placebo. The discontinuation rate due to adverse events (dizziness in 36% of cases and somnolence in 22%) during the randomized treatment phase was 16% with pregabalin and 7% with placebo. This commentary discusses the implications of these trials for clinical practice and considers areas for future research in the field. In view of the current results, duloxetine and pregabalin could be administered together and as part of multimodal and multidisciplinary therapy, but treatment should 'start low and go slow'.

### Pregabalin for pain in fibromyalgia in adults [^116oYiiq]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

This review updates part of an earlier Cochrane review on 'Pregabalin for acute and chronic pain in adults' (Moore 2009), and considers only fibromyalgia pain. Antiepileptic drugs have been used in pain management since the 1960s. Pregabalin is an antiepileptic drug also used in management of chronic pain conditions, including fibromyalgia. Pain response with pregabalin is associated with major benefits for other symptoms, and improved quality of life and function in people with chronic painful conditions.

Objectives

To assess the analgesic efficacy and adverse events of pregabalin for pain in fibromyalgia in adults, compared with placebo or any active comparator.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, and EMBASE for randomised controlled trials from inception to May 2009 for the original review and to 16 March 2016 for this update. We also searched the reference lists of retrieved studies and reviews, and online clinical trial registries.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised, double-blind trials of eight weeks' duration or longer, comparing pregabalin with placebo or another active treatment for relief of pain in fibromyalgia, and reporting on the analgesic effect of pregabalin, with subjective pain assessment by the participant.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed trial quality and potential bias. Primary outcomes were participants with moderate pain relief (at least 30% pain relief over baseline or much or very much improved on Patient Global Impression of Change scale (PGIC)) or substantial pain relief (at least 50% pain relief over baseline or very much improved on PGIC). Where pooled analysis was possible, we used dichotomous data to calculate risk ratio and number needed to treat (NNT), using standard methods. We assessed the quality of the evidence using GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) and created 'Summary of findings' tables.

Main Results

Our searches identified two new published studies with classic design, and one new published study with an enriched enrolment randomised withdrawal (EERW) design. We included eight studies. Five (3283 participants) had a classic design in which participants were randomised at the start of the study to pregabalin (150, 300, 450, or 600 mg daily) or placebo, with assessment after 8 to 13 weeks of stable treatment. No studies included active comparators. Studies had low risk of bias, except that the last observation carried forward (LOCF) imputation method used in analyses of the primary outcomes could overestimate treatment effect. Pregabalin increased the number of participants experiencing substantial benefit (at least 50% pain intensity reduction after 12 or 13 weeks' stable treatment (450 mg: RR 1.8, 95% CI 1.4 to 2.1, 1874 participants, 5 studies, high quality evidence)). Substantial benefit with pregabalin 300 to 600 mg was experienced by about 14% of participants with placebo, but about 9% more with pregabalin 300 to 600 mg (22% to 24%) (high quality evidence). Pregabalin increased the number of participants experiencing moderate benefit (at least 30% pain intensity reduction after 12 or 13 weeks' stable treatment) (450 mg: RR 1.5, 95% CI (1.3 to 1.7), 1874 participants, 5 studies, high quality evidence). Moderate benefit with pregabalin 300 to 600 mg was experienced by about 28% of participants with placebo, but about 11% more with pregabalin 300 to 600 mg (39% to 43%) (high quality evidence). A similar magnitude of effect was found using PGIC of 'very much improved' and 'much or very much improved'. NNTs for these outcomes ranged between 7 and 14 (high quality evidence). A small study (177 participants) compared nightly with twice-daily pregabalin, and concluded there was no difference in effect. Two studies (1492 participants began initial dose titration, 687 participants randomised) had an EERW design in which those with good pain relief after titration were randomised, double blind, to continuing the effective dose (300 to 600 mg pregabalin daily) or a short down-titration to placebo for 13 or 26 weeks. We calculated the outcome of maintained therapeutic response (MTR) without withdrawal, equivalent to a moderate benefit. Of those randomised, 40% had MTR with pregabalin and 20% with placebo (high quality evidence). The NNT was 5, but normalised to the starting population tested it was 12. About 10% of the initial population would have achieved the MTR outcome, similar to the result from studies of classic design. MTR had no imputation concerns. The majority (70% to 90%) of participants in all treatment groups experienced adverse events. Specific adverse events were more common with pregabalin than placebo, in particular dizziness, somnolence, weight gain, and peripheral oedema, with number needed to harm of 3.7, 7.4, 18, and 19 respectively for all doses combined (high quality evidence). Serious adverse events did not differ between active treatment groups and placebo (very low quality evidence). Withdrawals for any reason were more common with pregabalin than placebo only with the 600 mg dose in studies of classic design. Withdrawals due to adverse events were about 10% higher with pregabalin than placebo, but withdrawals due to lack of efficacy were about 6% lower (high quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Pregabalin 300 to 600 mg produces a major reduction in pain intensity over 12 to 26 weeks with tolerable adverse events for a small proportion of people (about 10% more than placebo) with moderate or severe pain due to fibromyalgia. The degree of pain relief is known to be accompanied by improvements in other symptoms, quality of life, and function. These results are similar to other effective medicines in fibromyalgia (milnacipran, duloxetine).

### Neuropathic pain responds better to increased doses of pregabalin: an in-depth analysis of flexible-dose clinical trials [^114XQPwE]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusion

The analysis demonstrates that many patients who do not respond to pregabalin at lower doses will subsequently respond when the dose is increased. Physicians are advised to follow treatment guidelines and escalate pregabalin to the dose that delivers optimal analgesia and tolerable side effects.

### An open-label, long-term study examining the safety and tolerability of pregabalin in Japanese patients with central neuropathic pain [^115q6iNH]. Journal of Pain Research (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Overall, our findings demonstrate that pregabalin is generally well tolerated over a 52-week treatment period in patients with chronic central neuropathic pain. Though descriptive in nature, our data also suggest that pregabalin is effective in the treatment of central neuropathic pain out to 1 year.

5.8 Weight Gain

Pregabalin treatment may cause weight gain. In pregabalin controlled clinical trials in adult patients of up to 14 weeks, a gain of 7% or more over baseline weight was observed in 9% of pregabalin -treated patients and 2% of placebo-treated patients. Few patients treated with pregabalin (0.3%) withdrew from controlled trials due to weight gain. Pregabalin associated weight gain was related to dose and duration of exposure but did not appear to be associated with baseline BMI, gender, or age. Weight gain was not limited to patients with edema [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].

Although weight gain was not associated with clinically important changes in blood pressure in short-term controlled studies, the long-term cardiovascular effects of pregabalin -associated weight gain are unknown.

Among diabetic patients, pregabalin -treated patients gained an average of 1.6 kg (range: -16 to 16 kg), compared to an average 0.3 kg (range: -10 to 9 kg) weight gain in placebo patients. In a cohort of 333 diabetic patients who received pregabalin for at least 2 years, the average weight gain was 5.2 kg.

While the effects of pregabalin -associated weight gain on glycemic control have not been systematically assessed, in controlled and longer-term open label clinical trials with diabetic patients, pregabalin treatment did not appear to be associated with loss of glycemic control (as measured by HbA1C).

5.9 Tumorigenic Potential

In standard preclinical in vivo lifetime carcinogenicity studies of pregabalin, an unexpectedly high incidence of hemangiosarcoma was identified in two different strains of mice [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. The clinical significance of this finding is unknown. Clinical experience during pregabalin's premarketing development provides no direct means to assess its potential for inducing tumors in humans.

In clinical studies across various patient populations, comprising 6396 patient-years of exposure in patients greater than 12 years of age, new or worsening-preexisting tumors were reported in 57 patients. Without knowledge of the background incidence and recurrence in similar populations not treated with pregabalin, it is impossible to know whether the incidence seen in these cohorts is or is not affected by treatment.

### Pregabalin in the management of painful diabetic neuropathy: a narrative review [^1125AG5E]. Diabetes Therapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Pregabalin is a first-line treatment in all major international guidelines on the management of painful diabetic neuropathy (pDPN). Treatment with pregabalin leads to a clinically meaningful improvement in pain scores, offers consistent relief of pain and has an acceptable tolerance level. Despite its efficacy in relieving neuropathic pain, more robust methods and comprehensive studies are required to evaluate its effects in relation to co-morbid anxiety and sleep interference in pDPN. The sustained benefits of modulating pain have prompted further exploration of other potential target sites and the development of alternative GABAergic agents such as mirogabalin. This review evaluates the role of pregabalin in the management of pDPN as well as its potential adverse effects, such as somnolence and dizziness, which can lead to withdrawal in~30% of long-term use. Recent concern about misuse and an increase in deaths linked to its use has led to demands for reclassification of pregabalin as a class C controlled substance in the UK. We believe these demands need to be tempered in relation to the difficulties it would create for repeat prescriptions for the many millions of patients with pDPN for whom pregabalin provides benefit.

### Pregabalin (pregabalin extended release) [^1175zBgV]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

5.8 Weight Gain

Pregabalin extended-release tablets treatment may cause weight gain. In pregabalin extended-release tablets controlled trials for pain indications, weight gain was experienced by 4% of pregabalin extended-release tablets-treated patients during the single-blind phase. Adverse events of weight gain were observed in 3.7% of pregabalin extended-release tablets-treated patients and 1% of placebo-treated patients during the double-blind phase.

In LYRICA controlled clinical trials of up to 14 weeks a gain of 7% or more over baseline weight was observed in 9% of LYRICA-treated patients and 2% of placebo-treated patients. Few patients treated with LYRICA (0.3%) withdrew from controlled trials due to weight gain. In studies with LYRICA, associated weight gain was related to pregabalin dose and duration of exposure, but did not appear to be associated with baseline BMI, gender, or age. Weight gain was not limited to patients with edema [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].

Although weight gain was not associated with clinically important changes in blood pressure in short-term controlled studies with LYRICA, the long-term cardiovascular effects of pregabalin-associated weight gain are unknown.

Among diabetic patients, LYRICA-treated patients gained an average of 1.6 kg (range: -16 to 16 kg), compared to an average 0.3 kg (range: -10 to 9 kg) weight gain in placebo patients. In a cohort of 333 diabetic patients who received LYRICA for at least 2 years, the average weight gain was 5.2 kg.

While the effects of pregabalin-associated weight gain on glycemic control have not been systematically assessed, in controlled and longer-term open-label clinical trials with diabetic patients, LYRICA treatment did not appear to be associated with loss of glycemic control (as measured by HbA1C).

8.1 Pregnancy

Pregnancy Exposure Registry

There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to pregabalin during pregnancy. To provide information regarding the effects of in utero exposure to pregabalin, physicians are advised to recommend that pregnant patients taking pregabalin enroll in the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) Pregnancy Registry. This can be done by calling the toll free number 1-888-233-2334, and must be done by patients themselves. Information on the registry can also be found at the website http://www.aedpregnancyregistry.org/.

Risk Summary

Observational studies on the use of pregabalin during pregnancy suggest a possible small increase in the rate of overall major birth defects, but there was no consistent or specific pattern of major birth defects identified (see Data). Available postmarketing data on miscarriage and other maternal, fetal, and long term developmental adverse effects were insufficient to identify risk associated with pregabalin.

Postmarketing data suggest that extended gabapentinoid use with opioids close to delivery may increase the risk of neonatal withdrawal versus opioids alone (see Clinical Considerations). There are no comparative epidemiologic studies evaluating this association. Therefore, it is not known whether exposure to pregabalin alone late in pregnancy may cause withdrawal signs and symptoms.

Epilepsy Currents (2018). Medium credibility.

Pregabalin (PGB) vs lamotrigine (LTG) — Class II double-blind study — used the proportion of patients seizure free for 6 continuous months as the primary endpoint; doses were adjustable for the first 24 weeks and then fixed, with a majority receiving PGB 150 mg/d or LTG 100 mg/d. Significantly more patients achieved seizure freedom with LTG than PGB; weight gain occurred more often with PGB; other frequent AEs (headaches, dizziness, somnolence, fatigue) did not differ, and AE-related withdrawal was 8% taking PGB vs 7% taking LTG.

### Short-term incubation of gabapentin or pregabalin does not affect chemically induced injury in neuronal cell models in vitro [^112wGDBV]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

According to recent estimations, about 7%–8% of the European population suffer from neuropathic pain. However, the management of this condition remains challenging. Therefore, multimodal approaches consisting of psycho- and physiotherapy, as well as pharmacological management, are usually employed. The current mainstay of pharmacological therapy for neuropathic pain is gabapentin and pregabalin (gabapentinoids), which have been effective in several clinical trials.–Nevertheless, despite their frequent and often long-term use, little is known about the consequences these drugs might exert on the structure and integrity of the central nervous system. This is even more important in light of recent evidence indicating morphological alterations in the brains of patients suffering from chronic pain compared to healthy controls. Here, particularly cortical neuronal cell bodies (gray matter) seem to be vulnerable to change.–Although gray matter reduction was first described in chronic back pain, similar alterations have subsequently been shown for other chronic-pain entities, including neuropathic pain.

### Pregabalin for the treatment of restless legs syndrome [^115pmHuo]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of pregabalin for the treatment of restless legs syndrome (RLS).

Data Sources

A search of the MEDLINE database (1956-February 2016) and EMBASE (1957-February 2016) was conducted, using the terms pregabalin and restless legs syndrome In addition, a manual review of the references cited in each publication identified from the database search was conducted to identify relevant articles.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All English-language, peer-reviewed publications were evaluated for relevance. From an initial review of 285 articles, 5 clinical trials were included in the final analysis.

Data Synthesis

Pregabalin is an analog of γ-aminobutyric acid that exhibits antinociceptive and anticonvulsant activity by binding to voltage-gated calcium channels in the central nervous system. Studies of pregabalin have demonstrated efficacy through significant reductions in mean International RLS Scale scores and wake after sleep onset scores, and it had a lower rate of augmentation than pramipexole treatment. Study durations ranged from 6 to 52 weeks, with doses ranging from 150 to 600 mg daily. The most common adverse effects associated with pregabalin use in all studies included dizziness and somnolence.

Conclusions

Clinical evidence suggests that pregabalin may improve symptoms of RLS and reduce disturbances in sleep, resulting in improvements in quality of life for patients affected by the disease. Pregabalin is considered to be relatively safe and poses a minimal risk of augmentation unlike current recommended first-line treatments for RLS. Thus, evidence suggests that pregabalin is a reasonable therapeutic option for the treatment of RLS.

### Efficacy and safety of pregabalin in generalised anxiety disorder: a critical review of the literature [^1128KbgV]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2015). Low credibility.

The aim of this review is to summarise the literature on the efficacy and safety of pregabalin for the treatment of generalised anxiety disorder (GAD). Of 241 literature citations, 13 clinical trials were identified that were specifically designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of pregabalin in GAD, including 11 randomised double-blind trials and two open-label studies. Pregabalin efficacy has been consistently demonstrated across the licensed dose range of 150–600 mg/day. Efficacy has been reported for pregabalin monotherapy in elderly patients with GAD, patients with severe anxiety, and for adjunctive therapy when added to a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor in patients who have failed to respond to an initial course of antidepressant therapy. The two most common adverse events with pregabalin are somnolence and dizziness, both of which appear to be dose-related. Pregabalin appears to have a low potential for causing withdrawal symptoms when long-term therapy is discontinued; however, tapering over the course of at least one week is recommended. A review of available evidence indicates that pregabalin is a well-tolerated and consistently effective treatment for GAD, with a unique mechanism of action that makes it a useful addition to the therapeutic armamentarium.

### Pregabalin for decreasing pancreatic pain in chronic pancreatitis [^1153yXdw]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic abdominal pain is one of the major symptoms in people with chronic pancreatitis. The role of pregabalin in people with chronic pancreatic pain due to chronic pancreatitis is uncertain.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of pregabalin in people with chronic abdominal pain due to chronic pancreatitis.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library 2015, issue 6, and MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index Expanded, trials registers until June 2015. We also searched the references of included trials to identify further trials.

Selection Criteria

We considered only randomised controlled trials (RCT) performed in people with chronic pancreatic pain due to chronic pancreatitis, irrespective of language, blinding, or publication status for inclusion in the review.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently identified trials and independently extracted data. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) or mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) with RevMan 5, based on intention-to-treat analysis.

Main Results

Only one study, funded by Pfizer, met the inclusion criteria for the review. A total of 64 participants (with chronic pain due to chronic pancreatitis) were randomly assigned to receive escalating doses of pregabalin (150 mg per day to 600 mg per day; 34 participants) or matching placebo (30 participants). Participants received pregabalin or placebo for three weeks on an outpatient basis; the outcomes were measured at the end of the treatment (i.e. three weeks from commencement of treatment). Potential participants taking concomitant analgesic medication and expected to stay on a stable regime during the trial were allowed to enter the study. This trial was at low risk of bias. The overall quality of evidence was low or moderate. Only the short-term outcomes were available in this trial. The medium and long-term outcomes, number of work days lost, and length of hospital stay due to admissions for pain control were not available. This trial found that the changes in opiate use (MD -26.00 mg; 95% CI -47.36 to -4.64; participants = 64; moderate-quality evidence), and pain score percentage changes from baseline (MD -12.00; 95% CI -21.82 to -2.18; participants = 64; moderate-quality evidence) were better in participants taking pregabalin compared to those taking placebo. This trial also found that there were more adverse events in participants taking pregabalin compared to those taking placebo (RR 1.71; 95% CI 1.20 to 2.43; participants = 64). The differences between pregabalin and placebo were imprecise for short-term health-related quality of life measured with the EORTC CLQ-30 questionnaire (MD 11.40; 95% CI -3.28 to 26.08; participants = 64; moderate-quality evidence), proportion of people with serious adverse events (RR 1.76; 95% CI 0.35 to 8.96; participants = 64; low-quality evidence), and proportion of people requiring hospital admissions (RR 0.44; 95% CI 0.04 to 4.62; participants = 64; low quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Based on low- to moderate-quality evidence, short-term use of pregabalin decreases short-term opiate use, and short-term pain scores, but increases the adverse events compared to placebo, in people with chronic pain due to chronic pancreatitis. The clinical implication of the decreases in short-term opiate use and short-term pain scores is not known. Future trials assessing the role of pregabalin in decreasing chronic pain in chronic pancreatitis should assess the medium- or long-term effects of pregabalin and should include outcomes such as, quality of life, treatment-related adverse events, number of work days lost, number of hospital admissions, and the length of hospital stay, in addition to pain scores, to assess the clinical and socioeconomic impact.

### Effects of pregabalin in patients with hypnotic-dependent insomnia [^116hmaAK]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Study Objectives

Long-term use of hypnotics runs the risk of dependency, and subjects usually experience difficulties in withdrawal. The objective of this study was to investigate the success of withdrawal using pregabalin and its efficacy on sleep in patients with hypnotic-dependent insomnia.

Methods

We enrolled patients with hypnotic-dependent insomnia who were 18 years or older. The starting dosage of pregabalin was 75 mg/day and was increased up to as much as 300 mg/day, depending on the individual patient's condition, while tapering off hypnotics. After 4 weeks of titration, the final dosage amount was maintained for at least another 4 weeks. Sleep and clinical variables were evaluated at baseline and after treatment, using the Korean versions of various sleep questionnaires as well as polysomnography.

Results

Forty subjects were enrolled, with a mean age of 52.0 ± 8.5 years, of whom 28 (70.0%) were women. Twenty-one (52.5%) subjects successfully withdrew from hypnotics. The duration of withdrawal was 42.1 ± 16.0 days (range: 27.0∼84.0). The mean pregabalin dose was 121.4 ± 69.0 mg/day (range: 75.0∼300.0). After pregabalin treatment, there was a significant improvement in the total score of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (15.0 ± 2.1, 8.9 ± 3.0, p < 0.001), and insomnia severity index (20.9 ± 4.3, 9.6 ± 4.4, p < 0.001); however, most of the sleep variables of the PSG showed no differences. The main adverse effects of pregabalin were nausea and dizziness.

Conclusions

Our results showed pregabalin may be a promising candidate for withdrawal from hypnotics and improved sleep in patients with hypnotic-dependent insomnia.

### Cardiovascular risk of gabapentin and pregabalin in patients with diabetic neuropathy [^1148MArH]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Using the large-scale nation-wide database of patient de-identified TriNetX EHRs, our study found that there is an increased risk of adverse cardiovascular events, including heart failure, myocardial infarction, peripheral vascular disease, stroke, deep venous thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism in patients with diabetic neuropathy, following long-term use of gabapentin and pregabalin, with highest risk for deep venous thrombosis. There were significant associations between short-term (3 month) gabapentin use and heart failure, myocardial infarction, peripheral vascular disease, deep venous thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism. Short-term (3 month) pregabalin use was associated with deep venous thrombosis and peripheral vascular disease.

Associations between gabapentin, pregabalin and heart failure have been reported in case reports, but not in observational studies. These case reports and observational studies are limited to short-term follow up. To the best of our knowledge, this study is among the first to report that long-term use of gabapentin and pregabalin is associated with increased risk for adverse cardiovascular events in patients with diabetic neuropathy. While the cardiovascular effects of gabapentin and pregabalin need to be verified in other populations that use these drugs, our findings call for thoughtful consideration of risk and benefit when deciding to use gabapentin and pregabalin long-term in patients with diabetic neuropathy, and possibly in other populations as well.

### Pregabalin add-on for drug-resistant focal epilepsy [^111ZsaNx]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Epilepsy is a common neurological disease that affects approximately 1% of the UK population. Approximately one-third of these people continue to have seizures despite drug treatment. Pregabalin is one of the newer antiepileptic drugs which have been developed to improve outcomes. This is an updated version of the Cochrane Review published in Issue 3, 2014, and includes three new studies.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and tolerability of pregabalin when used as an add-on treatment for drug-resistant focal epilepsy.

Search Methods

For the latest update we searched the Cochrane Register of Studies (CRS Web), which includes the Cochrane Epilepsy Group Specialized Register and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), on 5 July 2018, MEDLINE (Ovid, 1946 to 5 July 2018), ClinicalTrials.gov (5 July 2018), and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP, 5 July 2018), and contacted Pfizer Ltd, manufacturer of pregabalin, to identify published, unpublished, and ongoing trials.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials comparing pregabalin with placebo or an alternative antiepileptic drug as an add-on for people of any age with drug-resistant focal epilepsy. Double-blind and single-blind trials were eligible for inclusion. The primary outcome was 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency; secondary outcomes were seizure freedom, treatment withdrawal for any reason, treatment withdrawal due to adverse effects, and proportion of individuals experiencing adverse effects.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected and assessed trials for eligibility and extracted data. Analyses were by intention-to-treat. We presented results as risk ratios (RR) and odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Two review authors assessed the included studies for risk of bias using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool.

Main Results

We included nine industry-sponsored randomised controlled trials (3327 participants) in the review. Seven trials compared pregabalin to placebo. For the primary outcome, participants randomised to pregabalin were significantly more likely to attain a 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency compared to placebo (RR 2.28, 95% CI 1.52 to 3.42, 7 trials, 2193 participants, low-certainty evidence). The odds of response doubled with an increase in dose from 300 mg/day to 600 mg/day (OR 1.99, 95% CI 1.74 to 2.28), indicating a dose-response relationship. Pregabalin was significantly associated with seizure freedom (RR 3.94, 95% CI 1.50 to 10.37, 4 trials, 1125 participants, moderate-certainty evidence). Participants were significantly more likely to withdraw from pregabalin treatment than placebo for any reason (RR 1.35, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.65, 7 trials, 2193 participants, moderate-certainty evidence) and for adverse effects (RR 2.65, 95% CI 1.88 to 3.74, 7 trials, 2193 participants, moderate-certainty evidence). Three trials compared pregabalin to three active-control drugs: lamotrigine, levetiracetam, and gabapentin. Participants allocated to pregabalin were significantly more likely to achieve a 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency than those allocated to lamotrigine (RR 1.47, 95% CI 1.03 to 2.12, 1 trial, 293 participants) but not those allocated to levetiracetam (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.11, 1 trial, 509 participants) or gabapentin (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.12, 1 trial, 484 participants). We found no significant differences between pregabalin and lamotrigine (RR 1.39, 95% CI 0.40 to 4.83) for seizure freedom, however, significantly fewer participants achieved seizure freedom with add-on pregabalin compared to levetiracetam (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.85). No data were reported for this outcome for pregabalin versus gabapentin. We found no significant differences between pregabalin and lamotrigine (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.52), levetiracetam (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.49), or gabapentin (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.07) for treatment withdrawal due to any reason or due to adverse effects (pregabalin versus lamotrigine: RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.48; versus levetiracetam: RR 1.29, 95% CI 0.66 to 2.54; versus gabapentin: RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.54 to 2.11). Ataxia, dizziness, somnolence, weight gain, and fatigue were significantly associated with pregabalin. We rated the overall risk of bias in the included studies as low or unclear due to the possibility of publication bias and lack of methodological details provided. We rated the certainty of the evidence as very low to moderate using the GRADE approach.

Authors' Conclusions

Pregabalin, when used as an add-on drug for treatment-resistant focal epilepsy, is significantly more effective than placebo at producing a 50% or greater seizure reduction and seizure freedom. Results demonstrated efficacy for doses from 150 mg/day to 600 mg/day, with increasing effectiveness at 600 mg doses, however issues with tolerability were noted at higher doses. The trials included in this review were of short duration, and longer-term trials are needed to inform clinical decision making.

### Switching from long-term benzodiazepine therapy to pregabalin in patients with generalized anxiety disorder: a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^116X3NEc]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2012). Low credibility.

To evaluate the efficacy of pregabalin in facilitating taper off chronic benzodiazepines, outpatients (N = 106) with a lifetime diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder (current diagnosis could be subthreshold) who had been treated with a benzodiazepine for 8–52 weeks were stabilized for 2–4 weeks on alprazolam in the range of 1–4 mg/day. Patients were then randomized to 12 weeks of double-blind treatment with either pregabalin 300–600 mg/day or placebo while undergoing a gradual benzodiazepine taper at a rate of 25% per week, followed by a 6-week benzodiazepine-free phase during which they continued double-blind study treatment. Outcome measures included ability to remain benzodiazepine-free (primary) as well as changes in Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM)-A and Physician Withdrawal Checklist (PWC). At endpoint, a non-significant higher proportion of patients remained benzodiazepine-free receiving pregabalin compared with placebo (51.4% vs 37.0%). Treatment with pregabalin was associated with significantly greater endpoint reduction in the HAM-A total score versus placebo (-2.5 vs +1.3; p < 0.001), and lower endpoint mean PWC scores (6.5 vs 10.3; p = 0.012). Thirty patients (53%) in the pregabalin group and 19 patients (37%) in the placebo group completed the study, reducing the power to detect a significant difference on the primary outcome. The results on the anxiety and withdrawal severity measures suggest that switching to pregabalin may be a safe and effective method for discontinuing long-term benzodiazepine therapy.

Outcomes

Primary outcome

For the acute treatment of BD, our primary outcome was the efficacy of gabapentin or pregabalin as measured by the following: (i) number of hospital admissions during the study period, (ii) length of hospital admission, (iii) change on validated manic or depressive symptom rating scales from baseline, (iv) change on validated psychotic symptom rating scales from baseline, (v) response to treatment (i.e. at least 50% improvement on any validated rating scale), and (vi) time to cessation of additional treatment for manic/depressive symptoms. For the long-term treatment of BD, our primary outcome was efficacy measured by the following: (i) time to recurrence of any mood episodes, (ii) number of recurrences of any mood episodes during the trial period, and (iii) number of recurrences of manic, mixed, or depressive episodes. For the acute and long-term treatment of anxiety, our primary outcome was efficacy as measured by a change in validated and standardised anxiety rating scales. For the acute and long-term treatment of insomnia, our primary outcome was efficacy measured by the following: (i) objectively measured or self-reported sleep time, (ii) self-reported sleep quality, and (iii) sleep onset latency.

Secondary outcomes

Secondary outcomes included the acceptability and tolerability of gabapentin or pregabalin in acute/long-term treatment of BD, anxiety, and insomnia. Acceptability was measured as follows: (i) participants dropping out of treatment due to any cause, (ii) participants dropping out of treatment due to adverse events, and (iii) participants dropping out of treatment due to inefficacy. Tolerability was measured as follows: (i) the number of participants experiencing at least one side effect and (ii) the number of participants experiencing a pre-specified list of side effects in the British National Formulary.

### Pregabalin add-on for drug-resistant focal epilepsy [^115Mwm5x]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

This is an updated version of the Cochrane Review last published in Issue 7, 2019; it includes two additional studies. Epilepsy is a common neurological disease that affects approximately 1% of the UK population. Approximately one-third of these people continue to have seizures despite drug treatment. Pregabalin is one of the newer antiepileptic drugs that has been developed to improve outcomes. In this review we summarised the current evidence regarding pregabalin when used as an add-on treatment for drug-resistant focal epilepsy.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and tolerability of pregabalin when used as an add-on treatment for drug-resistant focal epilepsy.

Search Methods

For the latest update we searched the following databases on 16 November 2020: Cochrane Register of Studies (CRS Web), and MEDLINE (Ovid, 1946 to 16 November 2020). CRS Web includes randomised or quasi-randomised, controlled trials from PubMed, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, the World Health Organisation International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and the Specialised Registers of Cochrane Review Groups, including Epilepsy. We imposed no language restrictions. We contacted the manufacturers of pregabalin and authors in the field to identify any relevant unpublished studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials comparing pregabalin with placebo or an alternative antiepileptic drug as an add-on for people of any age with drug-resistant focal epilepsy. Double-blind and single-blind trials were eligible for inclusion. The primary outcome was 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency; secondary outcomes were seizure freedom, treatment withdrawal for any reason, treatment withdrawal due to adverse effects, and proportion of individuals experiencing adverse effects.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion and extracted the relevant data. Primary analyses were intention-to-treat (ITT). We presented summary risk ratios (RRs) and odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We evaluated dose response in regression models. We carried out a risk of bias assessment for each included study using the Cochrane risk of bias tool and assessed the overall certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We included 11 randomised controlled trials (3949 participants). Nine trials compared pregabalin to placebo. For the primary outcome, participants randomised to pregabalin were significantly more likely to attain a 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency compared to placebo (RR 1.95, 95% CI 1.40 to 2.72, 9 trials, 2663 participants, low-certainty evidence). The odds of response doubled with an increase in dose from 300 mg/day to 600 mg/day (OR 1.99, 95% CI 1.74 to 2.28), indicating a dose-response relationship. Pregabalin was significantly associated with seizure freedom (RR 3.94, 95% CI 1.50 to 10.37, 4 trials, 1125 participants, moderate-certainty evidence). Participants were significantly more likely to withdraw from pregabalin treatment than placebo for any reason (RR 1.33, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.60; 9 trials, 2663 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) and for adverse effects (RR 2.60, 95% CI 1.86 to 3.64; 9 trials, 2663 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Three trials compared pregabalin to three active-control drugs: lamotrigine, levetiracetam and gabapentin. Participants allocated to pregabalin were significantly more likely to achieve a 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency than those allocated to lamotrigine (RR 1.47, 95% CI 1.03 to 2.12; 1 trial, 293 participants) but not those allocated to levetiracetam (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.11; 1 trial, 509 participants) or gabapentin (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.12; 1 trial, 484 participants). We found no significant differences between pregabalin and lamotrigine for seizure freedom (RR 1.39, 95% CI 0.40 to 4.83). However, significantly fewer participants achieved seizure freedom with add-on pregabalin compared to levetiracetam (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.85). No data were reported for this outcome for pregabalin versus gabapentin. We detected no significant differences in treatment withdrawal rate for any reason or due to adverse effects, specifically, during either pooled analysis or subgroup analysis. Ataxia, dizziness, somnolence, weight gain, headache and fatigue were significantly associated with pregabalin than in active control. We rated the overall risk of bias in the included studies as low or unclear due to the possibility of publication bias and lack of methodological details provided. We assessed all the studies to be at a high risk of funding bias as they were all sponsored by Pfizer. We rated the certainty of the evidence as very low to moderate using the GRADE approach.

Authors' Conclusions

For people with drug-resistant focal epilepsy, pregabalin when used as an add-on treatment was significantly more effective than placebo at producing a 50% or greater seizure reduction and seizure freedom. Results demonstrated efficacy for doses from 150 mg/day to 600 mg/day, with increasing effectiveness at 600 mg doses, although there were issues with tolerability at higher doses. However, the trials included in this review were of short duration, and longer-term trials are needed to inform clinical decision-making. This review focused on the use of pregabalin in drug-resistant focal epilepsy, and the results cannot be generalised to add-on treatment for generalised epilepsies. Likewise, no inference can be made about the effects of pregabalin when used as monotherapy.

### Long-term pharmacological treatments of anxiety disorders: an updated systematic review [^115FUH58]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2016). Low credibility.

Many aspects of long-term pharmacological treatments for anxiety disorders (AnxDs) are still debated. We undertook an updated systematic review of long-term pharmacological studies on panic disorder (PD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), and social anxiety disorder (SAD). Relevant studies dating from January 1, 2012 to August 31, 2015 were identified using the PubMed database and a review of bibliographies. Of 372 records identified in the search, five studies on PD and 15 on GAD were included in the review. No studies on SAD were found. Our review confirms the usefulness of long-term pharmacological treatments for PD and GAD and suggests that they can provide further improvement over that obtained during short-term therapy. Paroxetine, escitalopram, and clonazepam can be effective for long-term treatment of PD. However, further studies are needed to draw conclusions about the long-term benzodiazepine use in PD, particularly for the possible cognitive side-effects over time. Pregabalin and quetiapine can be effective for long-term treatment of GAD, while preliminary suggestions emerged for agomelatine and vortioxetine. We did not find any evidence for determining the optimal length and/or dosage of medications to minimize the relapse risk. Few investigations have attempted to identify potential predictors of long-term treatment response. Personalized treatments for AnxDs can be implemented using predictive tools to explore those factors affecting treatment response/tolerability heterogeneity, including neurobiological functions/clinical profiles, comorbidity, biomarkers, and genetic features, and to tailor medications according to each patient's unique features.

### Pregabalin for acute and chronic pain in adults [^1174DjWC]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Antiepileptic drugs have been used in pain management since the 1960s. Pregabalin is a recently developed antiepileptic drug also used in management of chronic neuropathic pain conditions.

Objectives

To assess analgesic efficacy and associated adverse events of pregabalin in acute and chronic pain.

Search Strategy

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CENTRAL to May 2009 for randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Additional studies were identified from the reference lists of retrieved papers and on-line clinical trial databases.

Selection Criteria

Randomised, double blind trials reporting on the analgesic effect of pregabalin, with subjective pain assessment by the patient as either the primary or a secondary outcome.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two independent review authors extracted data and assessed trial quality. Numbers-needed-to-treat-to-benefit (NNTs) were calculated, where possible, from dichotomous data for effectiveness, adverse events and study withdrawals.

Main Results

There was no clear evidence of beneficial effects of pregabalin in established acute postoperative pain. No studies evaluated pregabalin in chronic nociceptive pain, like arthritis. Pregabalin at doses of 300 mg, 450 mg, and 600 mg daily was effective in patients with postherpetic neuralgia, painful diabetic neuropathy, central neuropathic pain, and fibromyalgia (19 studies, 7003 participants). Pregabalin at 150 mg daily was generally ineffective. Efficacy was demonstrated for dichotomous outcomes equating to moderate or substantial pain relief, alongside lower rates for lack of efficacy discontinuations with increasing dose. The best (lowest) NNT for each condition for at least 50% pain relief over baseline (substantial benefit) for 600 mg pregabalin daily compared with placebo were 3.9 (95% confidence interval 3.1 to 5.1) for postherpetic neuralgia, 5.0 (4.0 to 6.6) for painful diabetic neuropathy, 5.6 (3.5 to 14) for central neuropathic pain, and 11 (7.1 to 21) for fibromyalgia. With 600 mg pregabalin daily somnolence typically occurred in 15% to 25% and dizziness occurred in 27% to 46%. Treatment was discontinued due to adverse events in 18 to 28%. The proportion of participants reporting at least one adverse event was not affected by dose, nor was the number with a serious adverse event, which was not more than with placebo. Higher rates of substantial benefit were found in postherpetic neuralgia and painful diabetic neuropathy than in central neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia. For moderate and substantial benefit on any outcome NNTs for the former were generally six and below for 300 mg and 600 mg daily; for fibromyalgia NNTs were much higher, and generally seven and above.

Authors' Conclusions

Pregabalin has proven efficacy in neuropathic pain conditions and fibromyalgia. A minority of patients will have substantial benefit with pregabalin, and more will have moderate benefit. Many will have no or trivial benefit, or will discontinue because of adverse events. Individualisation of treatment is needed to maximise pain relief and minimise adverse events. There is no evidence to support the use of pregabalin in acute pain scenarios.

### Efficacy and tolerability of the new antiepileptic drugs: comparison of two recent guidelines [^115J36bC]. The Lancet: Neurology (2004). Medium credibility.

Background

Until the early 1990s six major compounds (carbamazepine, ethosuximide, phenobarbital, phenytoin, primidone, and valproic acid) were available for the treatment of epilepsy. However, these drugs have pharmacokinetic limitations, teratogenic potential, and a negative effect on cognitive functions that impairs the quality of patients' lives and limits the use of these drugs in some patients. In addition, 20–30% of patients are refractory to these drugs.

Recent Developments

The development of ten new antiepileptic drugs (vigabatrin, felbamate, gabapentin, lamotrigine, topiramate, tiagabine, oxcarbazepine, levetiracetam, zonisamide, and pregabalin) has expanded treatment options. The newer drugs may be better tolerated, have fewer drug interactions, and seem to affect cognitive functions to a lesser extent than old drugs. Guidelines on the use of new antiepileptic drugs have been developed in the USA and in the UK. Both guidelines offer a clear picture of the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of the new antiepileptic drugs and agree on their use as add-on treatment in patients who do not respond to conventional drugs. The guidelines differ in the type and strength of recommendations. Whereas the US guidelines recommend treatment in newly diagnosed epilepsy with a standard drug or a new drug depending on the individual patient's characteristics, the UK guidelines recommend that a new antiepileptic drug should be considered only if there is no benefit from an old antiepileptic drug, an old drug is contraindicated, there is a previous negative experience with the same drug, or the patient is a woman of childbearing potential.

Where Next

The limited amount of information on the new antiepileptic drugs may explain the discrepancies among the two guidelines and between these and other recommendations. Comparative, pragmatic, long-term and open trials should be done to show long-term efficacy and comparative features of the new antiepileptic drugs, and to better assess the effect on quality-of-life, cost-effectiveness, tolerability, and teratogenic potential. In addition, the conflicts should be resolved between the needs of the regulatory bodies and those of the treating physicians. Finally, there is a need for trial designs to be standardised.

8.1 Pregnancy

Pregnancy Exposure Registry

There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to pregabalin capsules during pregnancy. To provide information regarding the effects of in utero exposure to pregabalin capsules, physicians are advised to recommend that pregnant patients taking pregabalin capsules enroll in the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) Pregnancy Registry. This can be done by calling the toll free number 1-888-233-2334, and must be done by patients themselves. Information on the registry can also be found at the website

http://www.aedpregnancyregistry.org/.

Risk Summary

Observational studies on the use of pregabalin during pregnancy suggest a possible small increase in the rate of overall major birth defects, but there was no consistent or specific pattern of major birth defects identified (see Data). Available postmarketing data on miscarriage and other maternal, fetal, and long term developmental adverse effects were insufficient to identify risk associated with pregabalin.

Postmarketing data suggest that extended gabapentinoid use with opioids close to delivery may increase the risk of neonatal withdrawal versus opioids alone (see Clinical Considerations). There are no comparative epidemiologic studies evaluating this association. Therefore, it is not known whether exposure to pregabalin alone late in pregnancy may cause withdrawal signs and symptoms.

5.8 Weight Gain

Pregabalin capsules treatment may cause weight gain. In pregabalin capsules controlled clinical trials in adult patients of up to 14 weeks, a gain of 7% or more over baseline weight was observed in 9% of pregabalin capsules-treated patients and 2% of placebo-treated patients. Few patients treated with pregabalin capsules (0.3%) withdrew from controlled trials due to weight gain. Pregabalin capsules associated weight gain was related to dose and duration of exposure but did not appear to be associated with baseline BMI, gender, or age. Weight gain was not limited to patients with edema [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].

Although weight gain was not associated with clinically important changes in blood pressure in short-term controlled studies, the long-term cardiovascular effects of pregabalin capsules-associated weight gain are unknown.

Among diabetic patients, pregabalin capsules-treated patients gained an average of 1.6 kg (range: -16 to 16 kg), compared to an average 0.3 kg (range: -10 to 9 kg) weight gain in placebo patients. In a cohort of 333 diabetic patients who received pregabalin capsules for at least 2 years, the average weight gain was 5.2 kg.

While the effects of pregabalin capsules-associated weight gain on glycemic control have not been systematically assessed, in controlled and longer-term open label clinical trials with diabetic patients, pregabalin capsules treatment did not appear to be associated with loss of glycemic control (as measured by HbA1C).

5.9 Tumorigenic Potential

In standard preclinical in vivo lifetime carcinogenicity studies of pregabalin capsules, an unexpectedly high incidence of hemangiosarcoma was identified in two different strains of mice [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. The clinical significance of this finding is unknown. Clinical experience during pregabalin capsules premarketing development provides no direct means to assess its potential for inducing tumors in humans.

In clinical studies across various patient populations, comprising 6396 patient-years of exposure in patients greater than 12 years of age, new or worsening-preexisting tumors were reported in 57 patients. Without knowledge of the background incidence and recurrence in similar populations not treated with pregabalin capsules, it is impossible to know whether the incidence seen in these cohorts is or is not affected by treatment.

### Efficacy, safety, and tolerability of pregabalin treatment for painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy: findings from seven randomized, controlled trials across a range of doses [^111LNG3G]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

Over the course of 5 to 13 weeks of treatment, the incidence of clinically meaningful weight gain (defined using a Food and Drug Administration–guided criterion of ≥ 7% weight increase from baseline to end point) for pregabalin versus placebo was dose related: 2.01% for pregabalin at 150 mg/day (P = 0.14 [95% CI −0.47 to 3.03%]), 2.12% for pregabalin at 300 mg/day (P = 0.04 [−0.09 to 2.86%]), and 3.88% for pregabalin at 600 mg/day (P < 0.0001 [1.76–4.54%]) groups, compared with 0.73% for the placebo group. The odds of weight gain compared with placebo are 2.3-fold for pregabalin at 150 mg/day (P = 0.14 [0.77–6.60%]), 2.8-fold for pregabalin at 300 mg/day (P = 0.04 [1.06–7.47%]), and 6.2-fold for pregabalin at 600 mg/day (P < 0.0001 [2.82–13.67%]). Mean changes in weight from baseline to end point for pregabalin-treated patients versus placebo control subjects were 0.76 kg for pregabalin at 150 mg/day (P = 0.02 [0.08–1.11 kg]), 1.86 kg for pregabalin at 300 mg/day (P < 0.0001 [1.26–2.14 kg]), and 2.04 kg for pregabalin at 600 mg/day (P < 0.0001 [1.54–2.22 kg]); the mean change was 0.16 kg for placebo. The incidence of ≥ 7% weight gain by study duration across all pregabalin doses is as follows: 5 weeks, 2.8%; 8 weeks, 6.8%; and 12–13 weeks, 7.9%.

### Can the long term using of pregabalin in fibromyalgia affect the choroid and retinal nerve fiber layer? [^115RRUUW]. Eye (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

In this study, the effects of long-term pregabalin use on the choroid and retinal nerve fiber layer were investigated in the fibromyalgia disease.

Methods

The patient group consisted of 41 fibromyalgia patients using pregabalin. The control group consisted of 41 newly diagnosed fibromyalgia patients who had not received any treatment yet. Choroidal and retinal nerve fiber layer thickness measurements were performed with Cirrus HD-OCT (Carl Zeiss Meditec Inc, Dublin, CA, USA) 30minutes after pupil dilation with 1% tropicamide.

Results

There was no difference in subfoveal choroidal thickness, nasal choroidal thickness and temporal choroidal thickness between the patient and control groups (p > 0.05). Increasing the duration of drug use within the patient group was found to thin the retinal nerve fiber layer (p < 0.05).

Conclusion

We found that pregabalin had no effect on the choroid, while it had a thinning effect for retinal nerve fiber layer. It is recommended not to be preferred pregabalin in fibromyalgia patients with retinal nerve fiber layer damage such as diabetic retinopathy and glaucoma. Patients treated with pregabalin should have regular control in the ophthalmology clinic.

### Cardiovascular risk of gabapentin and pregabalin in patients with diabetic neuropathy [^112iStSh]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) provide annual guidance for clinicians. The standard of medical care in 2022 highlights cardiovascular disease management in patients with diabetes, as well as management of complications of diabetes, including diabetic neuropathy. Neuropathic pain in diabetes can be severe and can impact quality of life. Pregabalin and gabapentin are recommended as pharmacologic treatments for diabetic neuropathy. While both medications were initially developed as anticonvulsants, pregabalin was approved to treat diabetic neuropathy in 2014 and gabapentin is often prescribed "off label" to treat diabetic neuropathy.

Both gabapentin and pregabalin can cause fluid retention by altering arterial myogenic tone. Although fluid retention is not a recognized risk factor for cardiovascular disease, every medical condition that causes fluid retention — heart failure, nephrotic syndrome, cirrhosis, hypothyroidism, obstructive sleep apnea and Cushing's syndrome — is associated with an increased risk of myocardial infarcts, strokes, and venous thromboembolic disease. Moreover, previous studies have demonstrated that a number of medications that cause fluid retention are associated with an increased risk of adverse cardiovascular events. The list includes cyclo-oxygenase-2 inhibitors (COX-2 inhibitors), nonselective non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), hormone replacement therapy with estrogens and progestins, oral contraceptives, insulins and sulfonylureas.

The consensus from multiple guidelines and systematic reviews is that gabapentinoids, serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors and tricyclic antidepressants have the best evidence to support their use in the treatment of diabetic neuropathic pain but comparative effectiveness studies to inform the best choice are lacking. Opioid analgesics should be avoided due to their serious adverse effects and potential for addiction. Long-term use of gabapentin and pregabalin is generally well tolerated and provides sustained efficacy. However, currently it remains unknown whether long-term use of gabapentin and pregabalin in patients with diabetic neuropathy is associated with increased risk for adverse cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarcts, strokes, heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, and venous thromboembolic events.

### Pregabalin add-on for drug-resistant partial epilepsy [^111ZuKXv]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Epilepsy is a common chronic neurological disease with an estimated prevalence of 1% in the UK. Approximately one third of these people continue to have seizures despite drug treatment. In order to try to improve outcomes a number of new antiepileptic drugs have been developed and pregabalin is one of these. This review is an update of a previous Cochrane review (Pulman 2008); no further studies have been added since the previous update in 2012 and only one study has been identified as an ongoing trial.

Objectives

To summarise evidence from randomised controlled trials regarding the efficacy and tolerability of pregabalin when used as an add-on antiepileptic treatment in drug-resistant partial epilepsy. The definitions of drug resistance used were those employed by the authors of the included trials.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Epilepsy Group Specialized Register (Jan 2014), CENTRAL (the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, The Cochrane Library 2013, Issue 12), MEDLINE (Ovid, 1946 to 09/01/2014) and contacted Pfizer Ltd. (the manufacturers of pregabalin) to identify published, unpublished and ongoing trials.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials comparing pregabalin with placebo or an alternative antiepileptic drug for people with drug-resistant partial epilepsy. Outcomes included 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency, seizure freedom, treatment withdrawal for any reason, treatment withdrawal for adverse events and nature of adverse events.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors (JP and AGM) independently selected and assessed suitable trials and extracted data. Primary analyses were by intention-to-treat (ITT). Results are presented as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Included studies were assessed for risk of bias by two authors using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool.

Main Results

Six suitable industry-sponsored trials (2009 participants) were identified and included in the analysis. Trials tested doses of pregabalin ranging from 50 mg/day to 600 mg/day. For the primary outcome, 50% or higher seizure reduction was significantly more likely in patients randomised to pregabalin than to placebo (RR 2.61; 95% CI 1.70 to 4.01). A dose-response analysis suggested increasing effect with increasing dose. Pregabalin was significantly associated with seizure freedom (RR 2.59; 95% CI 1.05 to 6.36). Patients were significantly more likely to have withdrawn from pregabalin treatment than placebo treatment for any reason (RR 1.39; 95% CI 1.13 to 1.72) or for adverse effects (RR 2.69; 95% CI 1.88 to 3.86). Ataxia, dizziness, somnolence and weight gain were significantly associated with pregabalin. The odds of response doubled with an increase in dose from 300 mg/day to 600 mg/day (OR 2.12; 95% CI 1.76 to 2.54). Overall, the evidence was rated as low/unclear risk of bias due to the possibility of publication bias. The quality of the evidence was rated as moderate using the GRADE approach.

Authors' Conclusions

Pregabalin, when used as an add-on drug for treatment-resistant partial epilepsy, is significantly more effective than placebo at achieving a 50% or greater seizure reduction and significantly increasing seizure freedom. Results demonstrate efficacy for doses from 150 mg/day to 600 mg/day, with increasing effectiveness at 600 mg doses. The trials included in this review were of short duration and longer-term trials are needed to inform clinical decision making better.

### An open-label, long-term study examining the safety and tolerability of pregabalin in Japanese patients with central neuropathic pain [^115zGJYt]. Journal of Pain Research (2014). Low credibility.

Patients were required to discontinue gabapentin or cannabinoids at least 7 days before screening, and pregabalin at least 60 days prior. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors, and acetaminophen (≤ 1.5 g/day in Japan) were permitted as rescue therapy. Antidepressants were permitted if the patient was on a stable dose within 30 days prior to first visit.

Study design

This 53-week, open-label study was conducted from 2010 to 2012 at 26 medical centers in Japan. The study protocol was approved by the appropriate institutional review board or independent ethics committee at each participating investigational center, and all patients provided written informed consent prior to entering the study. This study was conducted in compliance with the ethical principles originating in or derived from the Declaration of Helsinki and in compliance with all International Conference on Harmonization Good Clinical Practice Guidelines.

The study was composed of three phases: a 2-week screening period for newly enrolled patients; a 52-week open-label treatment period; and a 1-week taper period. All patients received 75 mg of pregabalin on day 1 of the 52-week treatment period, and 150 mg/day for the remainder of the first week. Based on patient tolerability, the dose of pregabalin could be increased to 300 mg/day on day 8, 450 mg/day on day 15, and 600 mg/day on day 22. Weekly dose adjustments were allowed from day 8 until day 29. Ideally, after day 29, patients received their optimized dose of pregabalin until the end of the 52-week treatment period. However, in consideration of efficacy and safety, a single-level (± 150 mg/day) dose adjustment was allowed at each visit during the dose maintenance period (weeks 4, 8, 12, 20, 28, 36, and 44). After the week 52 visit, patients were tapered off pregabalin over a 1-week period.

Safety and tolerability measures

The primary endpoint of this study was to assess the safety and tolerability of pregabalin in patients with central neuropathic pain. The safety profile of pregabalin was assessed based on observed and reported AEs, which were evaluated throughout the study by the investigator for severity and relationship to treatment. Additional safety measures included ophthalmologic, neurologic, and physical examinations with assessment of vital signs; edema and deep vein thrombosis assessments; clinical laboratory testing; and 12-lead ECG.

### Highlights of prescribing information… [^116XGDBb]. FDA (DailyMed) (2025). Medium credibility.

There have been postmarketing reports of angioedema in patients during initial and chronic treatment with pregabalin. Specific symptoms included swelling of the face, mouth, and neck. There were reports of life-threatening angioedema with respiratory compromise requiring emergency treatment. Discontinue pregabalin immediately in patients with these symptoms. There have been postmarketing reports of hypersensitivity in patients shortly after initiation of treatment with pregabalin. Adverse reactions included skin redness, blisters, hives, rash, dyspnea, and wheezing. Discontinue pregabalin immediately in patients with these symptoms. In the pregabalin controlled trials in adult patients, dizziness was experienced by 30% of pregabalin-treated patients compared to 8% of placebo-treated patients; somnolence was experienced by 23% of pregabalin treated patients compared to 8% of placebo-treated patients.

Dizziness and somnolence generally began shortly after the initiation of pregabalin therapy and occurred more frequently at higher doses. In the pregabalin controlled trials in pediatric patients 4 to less than 17 years of age and 1 month to less than 4 years of age for the treatment of partial-onset seizures, somnolence was reported in 21% and 15% of pregabalin-treated patients compared to 14% and 9% of placebo-treated patients, respectively, and occurred more frequently at higher doses. For patients 1 month to less than 4 years of age, somnolence includes related terms lethargy, sluggishness, and hypersomnia. In controlled studies in adult patients, a higher proportion of patients treated with pregabalin reported blurred vision than did patients treated with placebo, which resolved in a majority of cases with continued dosing. Less than 1% of patients discontinued pregabalin treatment due to vision- related events.

Most Common Adverse Reactions in All Controlled Clinical Studies in Adults In premarketing controlled trials of all adult patient populations combined, dizziness, somnolence, dry mouth, edema, blurred vision, weight gain, and "thinking abnormal" were more commonly reported by subjects treated with pregabalin than by subjects treated with placebo.

### A review of the effects of pregabalin on sleep disturbance across multiple clinical conditions [^113NyshJ]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Pregabalin is approved for the treatment of a variety of clinical conditions and its analgesic, anxiolytic and anticonvulsant properties are well documented. Pregabalin's effects on sleep, however, are less well known. This review summarizes the published data on the effects of pregabalin on sleep disturbance associated with neuropathic pain, fibromyalgia, restless legs syndrome, partial onset seizures and general anxiety disorder. The data demonstrate that pregabalin has a positive benefit on sleep disturbance associated with several different clinical conditions. Polysomnographic data reveal that pregabalin primarily affects sleep maintenance. The evidence indicates that pregabalin has a direct effect on sleep that is distinct from its analgesic, anxiolytic and anticonvulsant effects.

### Pregabalin (Lyrica CR) [^112C2U7U]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.8 Weight Gain

LYRICA CR treatment may cause weight gain. In LYRICA CR controlled trials for pain indications, weight gain was experienced by 4% of LYRICA CR-treated patients during the single-blind phase. Adverse events of weight gain were observed in 3.7% of LYRICA CR-treated patients and 1% of placebo-treated patients during the double-blind phase.

In LYRICA controlled clinical trials of up to 14 weeks a gain of 7% or more over baseline weight was observed in 9% of LYRICA-treated patients and 2% of placebo-treated patients. Few patients treated with LYRICA (0.3%) withdrew from controlled trials due to weight gain. In studies with LYRICA, associated weight gain was related to pregabalin dose and duration of exposure but did not appear to be associated with baseline BMI, gender, or age. Weight gain was not limited to patients with edema [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].

Although weight gain was not associated with clinically important changes in blood pressure in short-term controlled studies with LYRICA, the long-term cardiovascular effects of pregabalin-associated weight gain are unknown.

Among diabetic patients, LYRICA-treated patients gained an average of 1.6 kg (range: -16 to 16 kg), compared to an average 0.3 kg (range: -10 to 9 kg) weight gain in placebo patients. In a cohort of 333 diabetic patients who received LYRICA for at least 2 years, the average weight gain was 5.2 kg.

While the effects of pregabalin-associated weight gain on glycemic control have not been systematically assessed, in controlled and longer-term open-label clinical trials with diabetic patients, LYRICA treatment did not appear to be associated with loss of glycemic control (as measured by HbA1C).

8.1 Pregnancy

Pregnancy Exposure Registry

There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to pregabalin during pregnancy. To provide information regarding the effects of in utero exposure to pregabalin, physicians are advised to recommend that pregnant patients taking pregabalin enroll in the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) Pregnancy Registry. This can be done by calling the toll free number 1-888-233-2334, and must be done by patients themselves.

Information on the registry can also be found at the website

http://www.aedpregnancyregistry.org/.

Risk Summary

Observational studies on the use of pregabalin during pregnancy suggest a possible small increase in the rate of overall major birth defects, but there was no consistent or specific pattern of major birth defects identified (see Data). Available postmarketing data on miscarriage and other maternal, fetal, and long term developmental adverse effects were insufficient to identify risk associated with pregabalin.

Postmarketing data suggest that extended gabapentinoid use with opioids close to delivery may increase the risk of neonatal withdrawal versus opioids alone (see Clinical Considerations). There are no comparative epidemiologic studies evaluating this association. Therefore, it is not known whether exposure to pregabalin alone late in pregnancy may cause withdrawal signs and symptoms.

### Non-opioid analgesics for the prevention of chronic postsurgical pain: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^111PQXPT]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2023). Medium credibility.

A recent systematic review evaluated pharmacotherapy for CPSP and included 110 RCTs, but was limited in scope. Limitations of this review include reporting of multiple outcomes based on factors not found to be effect modifiers on our meta-regression analysis, less strict criteria for assessing attrition bias, use of I² rather than prediction intervals for communicating statistical heterogeneity, lack of assessment of long-term opioid use or SAEs, no formal assessment of the certainty of evidence using GRADE, and no assessment of publication bias or assessment for imprecision. In terms of findings, some effects were observed for pregabalin, lidocaine, and NSAIDs, which were similar to some of our findings. However, our review found benefits with ketamine and dexmedetomidine on NMA. The previously published reviewreported intervention effect sizes without consideration of baseline risk despite vast ranges in underlying prevalence. As we have demonstrated, interventions can be more effective in higher baseline risk conditions. Therefore, if an intervention has been studied in certain lower baseline risk groups, effect estimates will be lower and might not be considered as clinically significant. For example, we found that for the primary outcome, lidocaine studies had a lower average baseline risk which could underestimate clinical significance for this agent. Moreover, the previous reviewfurther limited power by separating outcomes on the basis of time-point of outcome, drug duration, degree of pain, and type of surgery, whilst also separating interventions with identical pharmacological mechanisms. The major advantage of our NMA is improved power and the ability to take account of direct evidence where available. Also, by not separating outcomes in this way we further improved power. Although the trade-off of this could be increasing clinical heterogeneity, our adjustment for baseline risk and the lack of effect modification by time-point or type of surgery mitigates this substantially.

### Temporal analysis of pain responders and common adverse events: when do these first appear following treatment with pregabalin [^114zpJNZ]. Journal of Pain Research (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Pregabalin is an α2δ ligand indicated in the USA for treatment of a number of chronic pain conditions, including diabetic peripheral neuropathy, postherpetic neuralgia, pain associated with spinal cord injury, and fibromyalgia. A greater understanding of when patients first respond to treatment with pregabalin and when adverse events emerge, or worsen, could aid design of new proof-of-concept studies and help guide treatment of patients.

Methods

This was an analysis of five randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trials (between 8 and 16 weeks in duration) of flexible-dose pregabalin (150–600 mg/day). Individual patient data were pooled into three groups by disease condition: diabetic peripheral neuropathy or postherpetic neuralgia (n = 514), spinal cord injury (n = 356), and fibromyalgia (n = 498). Responders were classified as having a ≥ 30% and/or ≥ 50% reduction in mean pain score from baseline; once a patient responded, they were not scored subsequently (and were excluded from the responder analysis). The emergence of adverse events at each week was also recorded.

Results

The majority of the 30% and 50% responders emerged within the first 3–4 weeks with pregabalin, but were more uniformly distributed across the 6 weeks of the analysis with placebo. The majority of common adverse events also emerged within the first 3–4 weeks of pregabalin treatment.

Conclusion

These data suggest that the majority of pain responders and common adverse events emerge within 3–4 weeks of treatment with pregabalin. These data could advise new proof-of-concept studies and guide clinical management.

### Pregabalin (pregabalin extended release) [^114njeoy]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

8.4 Pediatric Use

The safety and effectiveness of pregabalin extended-release tablets in pediatric patients have not been established.

Juvenile Animal Toxicity Data

In studies in which pregabalin (50 mg/kg to 500 mg/kg) was orally administered to young rats from early in the postnatal period (Postnatal Day 7) through sexual maturity, neurobehavioral abnormalities (deficits in learning and memory, altered locomotor activity, decreased auditory startle responding and habituation) and reproductive impairment (delayed sexual maturation and decreased fertility in males and females) were observed at doses greater than or equal to 50 mg/kg. The neurobehavioral changes of acoustic startle persisted at greater than or equal to 250 mg/kg and locomotor activity and water maze performance at greater than or equal to 500 mg/kg in animals tested after cessation of dosing and, thus, were considered to represent long-term effects. The low effect dose for developmental neurotoxicity and reproductive impairment in juvenile rats (50 mg/kg) was associated with a plasma pregabalin exposure (AUC) approximately equal to human exposure at the maximum recommended dose of 660 mg/day. A no-effect dose was not established.

8.5 Geriatric Use

In controlled clinical studies of LYRICA in neuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy, 246 patients were 65 to 74 years of age, and 73 patients were 75 years of age or older.

In controlled clinical studies of LYRICA in neuropathic pain associated with postherpetic neuralgia, 282 patients were 65 to 74 years of age, and 379 patients were 75 years of age or older.

In the pregabalin extended-release tablets neuropathic pain associated with postherpetic neuralgia study, 422 patients 65 years of age and older received pregabalin.

No overall differences in safety and effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger patients, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.

Pregabalin is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. See Dosage and Administration (2.5) for recommendations for dosing in patients with renal impairment.

In animal reproduction studies, increased incidences of fetal structural abnormalities and other manifestations of developmental toxicity, including skeletal malformations, retarded ossification, and decreased fetal body weight were observed in the offspring of rats and rabbits given pregabalin orally during organogenesis, at doses that produced plasma pregabalin exposures (AUC) greater than or equal to 18 times human exposure at the maximum recommended dose (MRD) of 660 mg/day (see Data). In an animal development study, lethality, growth retardation, and nervous and reproductive system functional impairment were observed in the offspring of rats given pregabalin during gestation and lactation. The no-effect dose for developmental toxicity was approximately twice the human exposure at MRD.

The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations are unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively.

### WITHDRAWN: anticonvulsants for fibromyalgia [^111ZcKee]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Fibromyalgia (FM) is a clinically well-defined chronic condition of unknown aetiology characterised by chronic widespread pain that often co-exists with sleep problems and fatigue. People often report high disability levels and poor health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Drug therapy focuses on reducing key symptoms and disability, and improving HRQoL. Anticonvulsants (antiepileptic drugs) are drugs frequently used for the treatment of chronic pain syndromes.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of anticonvulsants for treating FM symptoms.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (Issue 8, 2013), MEDLINE (1966 to August 2013), PsycINFO (1966 to August 2013), SCOPUS (1980 to August 2013) and the reference lists of reviewed articles for published studies and www.clinicaltrials.gov (to August 2013) for unpublished trials.

Selection Criteria

We selected randomised controlled trials of any formulation of anticonvulsants used for the treatment of people with FM of any age.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted the data of all included studies and assessed the risks of bias of the studies. We resolved discrepancies by discussion.

Main Results

We included eight studies: five with pregabalin and one study each with gabapentin, lacosamide and levetiracetam. A total of 2480 people were included into anticonvulsants groups and 1099 people in placebo groups. The median therapy phase of the studies was 13 weeks. The amount and quality of evidence were insufficient to draw definite conclusions on the efficacy and safety of gabapentin, lacosamide and levetiracetam in FM. The amount and quality of evidence was sufficient to draw definite conclusions on the efficacy and safety of pregabalin in FM. Therefore, we focused on our interpretation of the evidence for pregabalin due to our greater certainty about its effects and its greater relevance to clinical practice. All pregabalin studies had a low risk of bias. Reporting a 50% or greater reduction in pain was more frequent with pregabalin use than with a placebo (risk ratio (RR) 1.59; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.33 to 1.90; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 12; 95% CI 9 to 21). The number of people who reported being 'much' or 'very much' improved was higher with pregabalin than with placebo (RR 1.38; 95% CI 1.23 to 1.55; NNTB 9; 95% CI 7 to 15). Pregabalin did not substantially reduce fatigue (SMD -0.17; 95% CI -0.25 to -0.09; 2.7% absolute improvement on a 1 to 50 scale) compared with placebo. Pregabalin had a small benefit over placebo in reducing sleep problems by 6.2% fewer points on a scale of 0 to 100 (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.35; 95% CI -0.43 to -0.27). The dropout rate due to adverse events was higher with pregabalin use than with placebo use (RR 1.68; 95% CI 1.36 to 2.07; number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) 13; 95% CI 9 to 23). There was no significant difference in serious adverse events between pregabalin and placebo use (RR 1.03; 95% CI 0.71 to 1.49). Dizziness was reported as an adverse event more frequently with pregabalin use than with placebo use (RR 3.77; 95% CI 3.06 to 4.63; NNTH 4; 95% CI 3 to 5).

Authors' Conclusions

The anticonvulsant, pregabalin, demonstrated a small benefit over placebo in reducing pain and sleep problems. Pregabalin use was shown not to substantially reduce fatigue compared with placebo. Study dropout rates due to adverse events were higher with pregabalin use compared with placebo. Dizziness was a particularly frequent adverse event seen with pregabalin use. At the time of writing this review, pregabalin is the only anticonvulsant drug approved for treating FM in the US and in 25 other non-European countries. However, pregabalin has not been approved for treating FM in Europe. The amount and quality of evidence were insufficient to draw definite conclusions on the efficacy and safety of gabapentin, lacosamide and levetiracetam in FM.

### Pregabalin (lyrica) for the management of pain associated… [^1112G3dH]. AAFP (2006). Low credibility.

Pregabalin is indicated for the management of pain associated with diabetic neuropathy and postherpetic neuralgia. It also is indicated as adjunctive therapy in adults with partial onset seizures. 1 Although the mechanism of action is not fully known, pregabalin seems to decrease the presynaptic release of neurotransmitters that are involved with pain sensation and transmission. It does not affect the underlying neuropathy or slow the progression.
2. SAFETY Results from clinical trials with pregabalin have not identified serious safety issues, although euphoria and signs of physical dependence may occur. One in 25 patients reported euphoria. 1 Abrupt discontinuation of pregabalin may lead to insomnia, headache, nausea, and diarrhea, and patients therefore should be gradually tapered off over a minimum of one week. 1 Pregabalin is a schedule V controlled substance. Studies assessing long-term safety have not been conducted.

Pregabalin is eliminated primarily by renal excretion and requires dose adjustment in patients with renal impairment. 1 It is U. S. Food and Drug Administration pregnancy category C. TOLERABILITY Approximately one in 11 patients will discontinue use of pregabalin because of side effects. Dizziness and somnolence are the most common side effects causing discontinuation. If dizziness or somnolence occur, the symptoms will begin shortly after initiation of treatment and in patients receiving higher doses. Dizziness occurs in almost one in three patients, and somnolence occurs in about one in five patients; however, only one in 25 patients will discontinue treatment because of these. 1 In patients receiving pregabalin, dry mouth, edema, weight gain, blurred vision, and difficulty concentrating occur at twice the rate seen in those receiving placebo.

1.

EFFECTIVENESS The manufacturer of pregabalin conducted four studies comparing pregabalin with placebo in patients with painful diabetic neuropathy. 2–5 Three of these studies were conducted in patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy and one study was conducted in patients with either diabetic peripheral neuropathy or postherpetic neuralgia. 2–5 Pregabalin 300 mg per day decreased mean pain scores by 2. 5 points from an average of
6. 5 points on a visual analog pain rating scale.

### Efficacy of pregabalin in post-traumatic peripheral neuropathic pain: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial [^112djRzq]. Journal of Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Key points

Question Is pregabalin efficacious and tolerable for the treatment of chronic, post-traumatic neuropathic pain?

Findings In a double-blind, randomized international study of 542 evaluable patients (pregabalin n = 274) of whom approximately half had post-surgical neuropathic pain, the primary efficacy analysis did not demonstrate a statistically significant difference between active treatment and placebo in change from baseline to week 15 (p = 0.1823). However, comparisons for key secondary outcome measures yielded p values < 0.05 favoring pregabalin. Safety and tolerability were consistent with the known profile of pregabalin.

Meaning Additional studies are needed to characterize the efficacy and tolerability of pregabalin for chronic, post-traumatic neuropathic pain.

### Safety and efficacy of pregabalin in adolescents with fibromyalgia: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial and a 6-month open-label extension study [^116SryLE]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Fibromyalgia (FM) is characterized by widespread chronic pain, sleep disturbance, and fatigue. FM can affect both adults and adolescents, where it is associated with significant impairment of social, emotional, and physical functioning. The pathophysiology of FM in both adults and adolescents is unknown; however, it is likely related to abnormalities in central nervous system pain and sensory processing. At the same time there appears to be a familial component to FM, and both genetic and environmental factors likely influence its development.

FM in adolescents is associated with significant impairment in physical functioning, lower perceived health status, and higher health care utilization compared with age-matched healthy peers. For most patients (> 80%), the symptoms of FM persist into young adulthood. Estimates of the prevalence of FM in adolescents vary markedly, from 1.0% up to 6.2%. These estimates are complicated by differences in the diagnostic criteria used. Recognition and diagnosis of FM in adolescents is often challenging, which can cause frustration and anxiety in patients and their parents.

These analyses included pregabalin data only from studies and treatment arms with a flexible dosing design, as this design is a closer representation of the recommended approach in clinical practice where pregabalin should be carefully titrated to the highest tolerable dose.–The recommended dosing for pregabalin in the USA is up to a maximum of 300 mg/day for DPN, between 300 and 600 mg/day for PHN, up to a maximum of 600 mg/day for SCI, and between 300 and 450 mg/day for FM. For all conditions, it is recommended that treatment start at 150 mg/day and escalate to 300 mg/day within 1 week based on individual efficacy and tolerability. Each of the trials in this analysis started with all patients receiving 150 mg/day before escalation to higher doses each week. As such, the emergence of 30% responders in this analysis after 1 week (15.0% with DPN/PHN, 19.0% with SCI, and 9.6% with FM) suggests a small degree of effectiveness of pregabalin, in some patients, before the optimal dose is reached. However, not all patients will respond to pregabalin at 150 mg/day, as also indicated here with higher numbers of responders at weeks 2 and 3. Current clinical guidelines support careful escalation to the highest tolerable approved dose,–with the reported average maintenance dose in the studies included in this analysis being ≥ 370 mg/day.

Consistent with previous studies, these analyses demonstrated that the most common AEs with pregabalin (somnolence and dizziness) typically emerge within the first 2 weeks. Other common AEs in these trials also tended to emerge within the 6 weeks of this analysis. One possible exception was increased weight in patients with FM (with 14 of 39 total instancesemerging in the first 6 weeks). This observation is consistent with previous analyses indicating that increased weight typically emerges following a longer period of pregabalin treatment (> 56 days).

The ability to anticipate which AEs may emerge, and when, could potentially improve adherence to pregabalin, by managing patient expectations. Some observational studies of pregabalin have reported lower rates of AEs and this has been credited to ongoing discussions between physicians and their patients regarding potential AEs. It could be that this is related to a reduction in the patient's anxiety, which then alters how they would perceive the occurrence of a mild AE.

### Benzodiazepine use disorder: common questions and answers [^117UkHzB]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

In the United States, more than 30 million adults have reported taking a benzodiazepine within the past year. Misuse-use of a drug in a way that a doctor did not direct-accounts for 17.2% of all benzodiazepine use. Family physicians face challenges when balancing the patient's perceived benefits of benzodiazepines with known risks and lack of evidence supporting their use. Benzodiazepines cause significant central nervous system-related adverse effects including sedation, confusion, memory loss, depression, falls, fractures, and motor vehicle crashes. Factors that increase the risk of adverse effects and misuse are other substance use disorders, using concomitant central nervous system medications, and central nervous system or pulmonary diseases. Compared with intermittent use, chronic daily use in older adults is associated with a higher risk of falls, fractures, hospitalizations, and death. Withdrawal symptoms such as anxiety, sleep disturbances, and agitation are common and often prolonged. Adjunctive treatment with antiepileptics, antidepressants, and pregabalin has been shown to lessen withdrawal symptoms. Deprescribing benzodiazepines for patients who use them chronically should be individualized with slow tapering over weeks to months, or longer, to minimize the intensity of withdrawal symptoms. Incorporating behavioral interventions, such as cognitive behavior therapy, improves deprescribing outcomes.

### Cognitive effects of pregabalin in healthy volunteers: a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^1171Anw9]. Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) can be associated with neurotoxic side effects including cognitive dysfunction, a problem of considerable importance given the usual long-term course of treatment. Pregabalin is a relatively new AED widely used for the treatment of seizures and some types of chronic pain including fibromyalgia. We measured the cognitive effects of 12 weeks of pregabalin in healthy volunteers.

Methods

Thirty-two healthy volunteers were randomized in a double-blind parallel study to receive pregabalin or placebo (1:1). Pregabalin was titrated over 8 weeks to 600 mg/d. At baseline, and after 12 weeks of treatment, all subjects underwent cognitive testing. Test-retest changes in all cognitive and subjective measures were Z scored against test-retest regressions previously developed from 90 healthy volunteers. Z scores from the placebo and pregabalin groups were compared using Wilcoxon tests.

Results

Thirty subjects completed the study (94%). Three of 6 target cognitive measures (Digit Symbol, Stroop, Controlled Oral Word Association) revealed significant test-retest differences between the pregabalin and placebo groups, all showing negative effects with pregabalin (p < 0.05). These cognitive effects were paralleled by complaints on the Portland Neurotoxicity Scale, a subjective measure of neurotoxicity (p < 0.01).

Conclusion

At conventional doses and titration, pregabalin induced mild negative cognitive effects and neurotoxicity complaints in healthy volunteers. These effects are one factor to be considered in the selection and monitoring of chronic AED therapy. Class of Evidence: This study provides Class I evidence that pregabalin 300 mg BID negatively impacts cognition on some tasks in healthy volunteers.

### Efficacy, safety, and tolerability of pregabalin treatment for painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy: findings from seven randomized, controlled trials across a range of doses [^1138suP5]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

The present analyses revealed that dosing schedule (BID vs. TID) apparently made no meaningful difference for patients treated with 600 mg/day, as both regimens were highly statistically significant versus placebo. This finding is in contrast to studies of postherpetic neuralgia in which BID efficacy was demonstrated across a range of doses from 150 to 600 mg/day. The basis for this difference in efficacy between disease states is not known, although it may be related, in part, to the permitted use of concomitant pain medication in all postherpetic neuralgia pregabalin clinical trials. However, the 150- and 300-mg/day doses were used BID in only one study in this pooled analysis, and further studies are required to definitively address this question.

The dose-related increase in efficacy was accompanied by a dose-related increase in incidence of most adverse events. Similarly, the rate of discontinuation due to an adverse event was dose related. Dizziness, somnolence, and peripheral edema were the most common adverse events. While there was a consistent increase in the incidence of dizziness across doses, the incidence of somnolence was similar in the 300- and 600-mg/day doses. Examination of adverse events by dosing regimen, i.e. BID versus TID, for each pregabalin daily dosage did not reveal any consistent patterns favoring one regimen over the other. There was a dose-related increase in peripheral edema (Table 1). Edema was not an exclusion criterion in any study; however, clinical judgment is warranted when pregabalin is used in patients with preexisting edema. Pregabalin was not associated with cardiovascular complications, rarely led to discontinuations, and was not associated with laboratory changes suggestive of renal or hepatic failure. The incidence of reported weight gain was not only dose related but also dependent on duration of exposure. The underlying cause of the weight gain is not known and does not appear to be related to the presence of peripheral edema. There was no evidence that the weight increase compromised glycemic control; the pooled analysis showed no clinically meaningful changes in A1C values in any dose cohort in studies with treatment durations of 5 to 13 weeks. Long-term studies are warranted to address this question.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of low back pain [^117ScwSw]. DoD/VA (2022). High credibility.

Low back pain — antiepileptics (gabapentin and pregabalin) are supported by very low quality evidence and a neutral stance; evidence on antiepileptics was limited to pregabalin and gabapentin, the Work Group's confidence in the quality of the evidence was very low, and the Work Group decided upon a Neither for nor against recommendation. Pregabalin is a controlled substance with the potential for abuse and dependence, while gabapentin is not federally scheduled but some states have scheduled it due to addiction and dependence concerns. One study indicates that gabapentin in combination with opioids significantly increases the risk of opioid-related mortality and respiratory depression. Gabapentin or pregabalin may be beneficial in patients with comorbid anxiety or insomnia, as these agents have been used off-label for these indications. The potential harms of adverse events (AEs), including medication abuse and dependence, slightly outweighed the benefits versus placebo.

### A clinical overview of off-label use of gabapentinoid drugs [^1165U2kB]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Background

The gabapentinoid drugs gabapentin and pregabalin were originally developed as antiseizure drugs but now are prescribed mainly for treatment of pain. For gabapentin, the only pain-related indication approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is postherpetic neuralgia. For pregabalin, FDA-approved indications related to pain are limited to postherpetic neuralgia, neuropathic pain associated with diabetic neuropathy or spinal cord injury, and fibromyalgia. Despite these limited indications, gabapentin and pregabalin are widely prescribed off-label for various other pain syndromes. Such use is growing, possibly because clinicians are searching increasingly for alternatives to opioids.

Observations

This report summarizes the limited published evidence to support off-label gabapentinoid uses, describes clinical cases in which off-label use is problematic, and notes how review articles and guidelines tend to overstate gabapentinoid effectiveness.

Conclusions

Clinicians who prescribe gabapentinoids off-label for pain should be aware of the limited evidence and should acknowledge to patients that potential benefits are uncertain for most off-label uses.

### Trigeminal neuralgia: current approaches and emerging interventions [^111PTkY9]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Pregabalin

Pregabalin is similar to gabapentin in that it is also a GABA analog that inhibits the α2δ subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels and reduces neurotransmitter release. Compared to gabapentin, however, pregabalin exhibits improved absorption and pharmacokinetic profiles. Hamasaki et al studied pregabalin in 33 patients with carbamazepine-refractory TN, with 48.5% of patients reporting improved pain. A logistic regression analysis demonstrated that among all the clinical variables considered, older age was significantly associated with effectiveness of pregabalin treatment. Obermann et al studied 53 patients with TN with or without chronic facial pain and found that 39 (74%) patients improved after 8 weeks. Patients without chronic facial pain were statistically more likely to respond, p = 0.02. Rustagi et al demonstrated in a trial of 22 patients that uses pregabalin or lamotrigine in addition to carbamazepine had equal improvement in pain control; however, patients on pregabalin had fewer side effects. Side effects of pregabalin are similar to those of gabapentin, including sedation and dizziness, and lower extremity edema. In rare cases, patients have been seen to develop thrombocytopenia.

Clonazepam

Clonazepam is a highly potent and long-acting benzodiazepine that acts as a positive allosteric modulator on GABA-A receptors. Trialed in 30 patients that were refractory to carbamazepine in 1975, 40% had complete control of neuralgia and 23.3% were significantly helped by the drug. Dosing, however, averaged 6 mg to 8 mg per day, and 80–88% of the patients experienced somnolence and unsteady gait. Side effects of clonazepam include sedation, ataxia, memory impairment, and risk for dementia with long-term use. Patients can also experience a paradoxical reaction and become agitated and behave aggressively.

Valproate

Valproate is an anticonvulsant that mediates its effects through blockade of voltage-gated sodium channels and increased levels of GABA. Peiris et al administered valproate to 20 patients with trigeminal neuralgia. Six out of 20 patients had no attacks for 6–18 months while, in 3 patients, the frequency and severity of attacks were reduced by at least 50%. In the United States, valproate contains black box warnings for hepatotoxicity, pancreatitis, and fetal malformations. Most commonly people experience weight gain, hair loss, and nausea. Patients may also develop thrombocytopenia or abnormal ammonia levels and elevated liver function tests.

### Pregabalin in the management of painful diabetic neuropathy: a narrative review [^1125t5pR]. Diabetes Therapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Adverse Effects

The frequently reported side effects of pregabalin include somnolence, dizziness, peripheral oedema and weight gain, which are usually mild to moderate. These effects are thought to be related to the drug's effects on neurotransmitter release and calcium currents. Pregabalin may cause adverse events on cognition and coordination. In addition, treatment is associated with weight gain, which is in part dependent on the total drug dose, thus raising an issue that needs to be considered in treating patients with type 2 diabetes. There is a theoretical risk of worsening metabolic control with the associated weight gain from gabapentanoids; a pooled analysis of data from 11 double-blind randomised controlled trials (RCT) of pregabalin (150–600 mg/day) vs. placebo showed no clinically meaningful effects of pregabalin on glycaemic or lipid profiles in patients with pDPN, whilst data on weight were not presented. The effects on weight should be considered when starting pregabalin as part of a personalised treatment approach.

### Best practices guidelines for acute pain management in trauma patients [^115TfNrQ]. ACS (2020). High credibility.

Adjuvant analgesics — gabapentinoids (gabapentin and pregabalin) may lessen neuropathic pain but require caution. They "reduce neuropathic pain by inhibiting presynaptic calcium channels", and "gabapentinoid use decreases opioid requirements in select populations (e.g., in patients with spinal cord injury or burn)", yet "limited evidence exists to support a broad analgesic effect". Safety concerns include that "abuse and misuse of gabapentin and pregabalin was reported", the directive to "Use gabapentinoids with caution in patients with or at risk of developing an SUD", and that they "produce additive CNS depression and increase risk of death when used in combination with opioids". Because "both pregabalin and gabapentin are renally eliminated", the page advises to "use lower doses or avoid them in patients with underlying renal disease and in elderly patients".

### Safety and efficacy of pregabalin in adolescents with fibromyalgia: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial and a 6-month open-label extension study [^112dmBcQ]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2016). Low credibility.

In studies of pregabalin in adults with FM, patients were treated with a minimum of 300 mg/day (with the exception of the first study, which included the 150 mg/day dose level), and pregabalin is approved in adults at doses of 300 or 450 mg/day. In this double-blind study, almost half (44.2%) of the subjects were treated with a maintenance dose of pregabalin that was < 300 mg/day.

Post hoc analyses of the double-blind study revealed significant differences in response between subjects from the United States and those from other countries. For example, the median dose of pregabalin in non-US subjects was 75 mg/day, indicating that the majority of non-US subjects received a much lower dose than has been shown to be efficacious in adults. As these subjects had a notably smaller treatment effect with pregabalin, this might have initially suggested that utilizing a fixed, higher dose of pregabalin could have changed the outcome of this study. However, the placebo response in non-US subjects was notably large; the change in pain score at endpoint with placebo was −2.55, compared with −0.52 in US subjects. At the same time, 71.4% of non-US subjects treated with placebo indicated that their condition was very much improved or much improved at endpoint, compared with 10.0% of placebo-treated US subjects. This notably large placebo response suggests that a higher dose of pregabalin alone would have been unlikely to have resulted in a significant treatment difference in these subjects.

### Pregabalin: preliminary experience in intractable childhood epilepsy [^116SHraa]. Pediatric Neurology (2009). Low credibility.

Pregabalin is a new antiepileptic drug that acts at presynaptic calcium channels, modulating neurotransmitter release. We report on treating consecutive children with severe drug-resistant epilepsy in a prospective, open-label, add-on trial. Nineteen children (63% male) aged 4–15 years (mean, 9.7; S.D., 2.9) were included. Most (74%) had daily seizures that failed multiple drugs (mean, 5). Epilepsy was symptomatic in 58%, and 74% exhibited associated cognitive deficits. Seizures were mixed in nine (47%), and four (21%) manifested Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Pregabalin was maintained at 150–300 mg/day. On pregabalin, one (6%) child became seizure-free, and seven (37%) had > 50% seizure reduction. The percentage of children with daily seizures was reduced from 74% before pregabalin to 37% afterward (P < 0.002). Side effects were evident in six (32%) with somnolence, weight gain, dizziness, or behavioral change. The drug was withdrawn in five (26%) children for lack of efficacy, and in two (11%) for worsening of myoclonic epilepsy. We conclude that pregabalin is a useful addition in the treatment of refractory childhood epilepsy. The drug should be used with caution in myoclonic epilepsy. Controlled studies are needed to establish long-term efficacy and tolerability.

### Effectiveness of pharmacological therapies for fibromyalgia syndrome in adults: an overview of cochrane reviews [^113JBpfN]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Pharmacological interventions are recommended as part of a multidisciplinary approach combined with physical and/or cognitive interventions for severe forms of FMS. Treatment is often by antidepressants (typically duloxetine and amitriptyline) or antiepileptics (typically gabapentin or pregabalin). Substantial (worthwhile) pain relief is achieved by a small proportion of patients. Individuals experiencing substantial levels of pain relief with pregabalin also benefited from substantial improvements in other symptoms, of fatigue, function, sleep, depression, anxiety and ability to work, with significant improvement in quality of life. Good response in only a small proportion of people is typical of chronic pain conditions.

Standards used to assess evidence in chronic pain trials pay particular attention to trial duration, withdrawals and statistical imputation following withdrawal, which can substantially alter estimates of efficacy. An important recent change is the move towards assessing the number of participants who experience a large decrease in pain (by at least 50%) continuing in treatment in trials of 8–12 weeks or longer rather than average measures. Pain intensity reduction of 50% or more has been correlated with improvements in comorbid symptoms, function and quality of life for people with chronic pain and FMS. An overview of the evidence for these outcomes is relevant for people with FMS and their carers.

The primary objectives of this overview were to summarize the therapeutic effectiveness and safety of pharmacological therapies for pain compared with placebo in adults with FMS.

### An open-label, long-term study examining the safety and tolerability of pregabalin in Japanese patients with central neuropathic pain [^115M514v]. Journal of Pain Research (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

The results of this open-label study support the safety and efficacy of pregabalin for the management of central neuropathic pain over a 1-year treatment period. Treatment-related AEs in this study were consistent with the known safety profile of pregabalin. Somnolence, however, occurred more frequently in the current population (48.5%) than in previous studies of pregabalin for the treatment of central neuropathic pain. In previous short-term trials (13–17 weeks), somnolence was reported by 35.7% of patients with spinal cord injury, and 20.9% of patients with post-stroke pain. The incidence of somnolence in the current study was also higher than that observed in long-term studies of pregabalin in Japanese patients with peripheral neuropathic pain due to DPN (22.8%)or PHN (15.1%). This may be explained by the fact that benzodiazepines were allowed as concomitant treatment in the current study, whereas they were prohibited during the trials of PHN and DPN. Indeed, benzodiazepines may add to the central nervous system side effects of pregabalin and have been shown to increase the rate of somnolence when used in addition to pregabalin. Most instances of treatment-related somnolence (n = 50) in the current study were mild in severity (mild n = 43, moderate n = 6, severe n = 1), and only three patients discontinued treatment due to somnolence.

What should I avoid while taking pregabalin capsules?

Do not drive a car, work with machines, or do other dangerous activities until you know how pregabalin affects you.
Do not drink alcohol while taking pregabalin. Pregabalin and alcohol can affect each other and increase side effects such as sleepiness and dizziness.

What are the possible side effects of pregabalin capsules?

Pregabalin capsules may cause serious side effects, including:

See "What is the most important information I should know about pregabalin?"

### Pregabalin as mono-or add-on therapy for patients with refractory chronic neuropathic pain: a post-marketing prescription-event monitoring study [^113vxQVY]. Journal of Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

This observational study examined the outcome of two different therapeutic strategies in the treatment of chronic neuropathic pain by including pregabalin (PGB) as mono- or add-on therapy in one of two treatment options. Patients with a pain score of ≥ 4, refractory to usual care for neuropathic pain for at least 6 months, were allocated consecutively to one of two treatment strategies according to the decision of the physician: complete switch to a flexible-dosage, monotherapeutic or add-on therapy with pregabalin (PGB group), or change established doses and combinations of pre-existing mono- or combination therapy without pregabalin (non-PGB group). After 4 weeks (primary endpoint) a significant improvement in pain reduction was documented in both intention-to treat (ITT) analysis (PGB group, n = 85: mean pain score reduction of 3.53, SD 2.03, p < 0.001; non-PGB group, n = 102; mean pain score reduction of 2.83, SD 2.23, p < 0.001) and per-protocol (PP) analysis (PGB group, n = 79: mean pain score reduction 3.53 vs. 2.83, p < 0.05; non-PGB group, n = 81; 3.5 vs. 2.9, p < 0.05) compared to baseline. Comparison of the results observed in the two groups shows that patients in the PGB group achieved significantly greater pain reduction. These results demonstrate that PGB administered twice daily is superior to treatment regimes without PGB in reducing pain and pain-related interference in quality of life.

### Exposure to medication for neurological disease in pregnancy-time to consider the long-term implications? [^112SstiM]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Neurocognitive and neurodevelopmental impacts

Sodium valproate was the first ASM where consistent long-term adverse neurodevelopmental impacts on children exposed in utero were demonstrated. Children exposed to valproate during pregnancy are at increased risk of delayed infant neurodevelopment, with dose-related higher rates of behavioural disorders such as autistic spectrum disorders, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and increased risk of reduced cognitive functioning in school aged children and adolescents.

Evidence regarding long-term neurodevelopmental effects following in utero exposure to other ASMs is more limited. Carbamazepine is relatively well studied, but conflicting results are present, likely due to varying methodologies. In prospective studies of school age children exposed to carbamazepine monotherapy, IQ appears to be similar to that of controls; similarly epidemiological cohorts using routinely collected healthcare data do not demonstrate significantly increased rates of intellectual disability (IQ < 70). However, others report a 4-fold increase in risk of lower IQ with monotherapy exposure to carbamazepine, clonazepam, and oxcarbazepine. Rates of autistic spectrum disorder or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder are not reportedly raised following carbamazepine exposure. Whilst there is no clear dose-association, studies examining higher doses of carbamazepine with comprehensive blinded assessment of cognitive skills are lacking.

One study reported significantly reduced infant language development following exposure to lamotrigine, with increased difficulty with formulation of sentence structure at 36 months, but this did not persist at a later follow up point. This finding has not been replicated in other studies. There is no evidence to date of increased rates of intellectual disability or neurodevelopmental disorders in school-age children following lamotrigine exposure. Similarly, levetiracetam exposure has not been associated with delayed infant development or school age cognitive impairments, albeit with limited data.

Recently, questions have been raised about the association between topiramate exposure and an increased risk of autistic spectrum disorders, and intellectual disability. However, replication and extension of these findings are required, including work to understand if the potential neurodevelopmental impacts are linked to the adverse neonatal outcomes reported including an increased likelihood of oral cleft development, eleven times higher than the general population, in exposed neonates.,

Evidence pertaining to other ASMs are extremely limited. Lacosamide, a sodium channel blocker with increasing usage has no available data regarding potential neurodevelopmental impact. Population level epidemiological studies have not consistently found increased rates of autistic spectrum disorders following prenatal exposures to gabapentin, pregabalin, or clonazepam. However, smaller groups sizes and relatively young cohorts are clear limitations.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of low back pain [^112xuerN]. DoD/VA (2022). High credibility.

Recommendation 20 — gabapentin or pregabalin for low back pain: For patients with low back pain, with or without radicular symptoms, there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against gabapentin or pregabalin. Evidence cited includes a systematic review (SR) by Shanthanna et al. (2017) of radicular and non-radicular chronic low back pain that included three randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and found no difference between gabapentin (n = 91) and placebo (n = 94) in reducing pain severity or functional outcomes. The SR also reported overall improvement in pain with pregabalin (n = 163) versus active analgesic control (n = 169), with a pooled SMD of 0.42, (p = 0.0002); however, the quality of the evidence was very low and individual studies had mixed results, with one of the three studies reporting no benefit, and study follow-up ranged from 4–14 weeks. An RCT of pregabalin in radiculopathy not included in the SR reported no significant reduction in leg pain intensity and a higher incidence of adverse events (AEs). Adverse effects are emphasized: higher adverse effects with gabapentin versus placebo, including fatigue, dizziness, loss of balance, and difficulties with mental concentration, memory, and visual accommodation; an increased risk of dizziness with pregabalin when compared to placebo; and that antiepileptic medications, including pregabalin and gabapentin, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior, so patients should be monitored for the emergence of worsening depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any changes in mood or behavior.

### Cardiovascular risk of gabapentin and pregabalin in patients with diabetic neuropathy [^114tMj9Q]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2022). Medium credibility.

One possible explanation for the findings is that gabapentin and pregabalin can alter arterial myogenic tone and cause fluid retention. Fluid retention causes either an increase in cardiac output or an increase in blood pressure. Velocity of blood flow increases either way, thereby increasing turbulence of blood flow. Increased turbulence reduces shear stress upon arterial walls, thereby increasing endothelial dysfunction, which is a well-established cardiovascular risk factor. However, our finding cannot rule out other potential mechanisms. Future research is necessary to further understand the underlying mechanism of the observed increased risk of CVDs among patients with diabetic neuropathy who were prescribed gabapentin and pregabalin. Additional work is needed to determine if other medications that cause fluid retention are also associated with increased adverse cardiovascular events. Anti-hypertensive medications that cause fluid retention, notably calcium channel blockers, alpha receptor antagonists and hydralazine, have favorable cardiovascular effects. Aromatase inhibitors and androgen deprivation therapy cause fluid retention but increase the longevity of cancer patients. For medications that do not improve longevity, do not lower blood pressure (BP) and that are used long-term, such as androgens, corticosteroids (when used to treat non-life-threatening conditions), mineralocorticoids, pramipexole and ropinirole, patients and clinicians need to know if there is an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. For androgens, the research literature is inconclusive concerning cardiovascular risk: some studies have documented an increased risk of adverse cardiovascular events while other studies have failed to do so. Cardiovascular safety data is needed for medications that cause fluid retention but do not increase longevity or lower BP.

If an increased risk of adverse cardiovascular events is also associated with other medications that cause fluid retention, then our study has implications for the pharmaceutical industry and for the entities responsible for regulating pharmaceutical products: the Food and Drug Administration in the United States, the European Medicines Agency in the European Union, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency in Britain, and the Health Products and Food Branch of Health Canada. If fluid retention is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, then data regarding the fluid retention properties of medications would be relevant to the drug approval process. In that circumstance, for medications that do not extend life, do not lower BP and are intended to be used long term, regulatory agencies should require new drug applications to provide fluid retention data. Cardiovascular safety data would be warranted for medications that cause fluid retention.

### Pharmacovigilance in hospice / palliative care: net effect of pregabalin for neuropathic pain [^112ngG39]. BMJ Supportive & Palliative Care (2016). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Real-world effectiveness of many medications has been poorly researched, including in hospice/palliative care. Directly extrapolating findings from other clinical settings may not yield robust clinical advice. Pharmacovigilance studies provide an opportunity to understand better the net impact of medications. The study aimed to examine immediate and short-term benefits and harms of pregabalin in routine practice for neuropathic pain in hospice/palliative care.

Methods

A consecutive cohort of 155 patients from 62 centres in 5 countries was started on pregabalin and studied prospectively. Data were collected at three time points: baseline; day 7 (immediate, short-term harms); ad hoc reports of any harms ≤ 21days; and day 21 (short-term benefits).

Results

Median dose for 155 patients at day 21 was 150mg/24h. Benefits were reported by 61 patients (39%), of whom 11 (7%) experienced complete pain resolution. Harms were reported by 51 (35%) patients at or before 7days, the most frequent of which were somnolence, fatigue, cognitive disturbance and dizziness. 10 patients (6%) ceased pregabalin due to harms, but 82 patients (53%) were being treated at 21days. In regression modelling, people with worse baseline pain derived more benefit (OR = 8.5 (95% CI 2.5 to 28.68).

Conclusions

Pregabalin delivered benefit to many patients, with 4 of 10 experiencing pain reductions by 21days. Harms, occurring in 1 in 3 patients, may be difficult to detect in clinical practice, as they mostly involve worsening of symptoms prevalent at baseline.

### Spine injury [^114coryX]. ACS (2022). High credibility.

Analgesia in spinal cord injury — multimodal pharmacologic management: The multimodal approach to pain management is recommended in the acute pain management of SCI patients, and initial regimens may include a combination of opiates, acetaminophen, or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents. Although the literature is mixed regarding the impact of NSAID use on union/nonunion, there is support for its use in the acute post-operative phase, while chronic long-term use may have detrimental effects on bone healing; several pre-clinical animal studies report NSAID use may be protective against inflammatory processes after SCI. For neuropathic pain, anticonvulsants (gabapentinoids, such as gabapentin and pregabalin) and antidepressants (tricyclic antidepressants, such as amitriptyline or novel antidepressants) are recommended over other modalities, longer-term management may include spinal cord stimulation, and knowledge of side effects and prescribing nuances is critical.

### A systematic guideline by the ASPN workgroup on the evidence, education, and treatment algorithm for painful diabetic neuropathy: SWEET [^116t5N1B]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Section 1. Pharmacotherapy

All patients with diabetes should be screened for PDN and, if present, should be appropriately treated. There are three classes of medications that are primarily used for the treatment of PDN. These classes include serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), gabapentinoids, and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs). The individual medications belonging to each of these classes are presented later in this section. Of all these oral agents, duloxetine, pregabalin, and tapentadol are approved by the FDA for the treatment of painful diabetic neuropathy. Drugs belonging to the TCA class are often used and effective for various neuropathic pain conditions; however, these agents have not been studied in randomized control trials specifically for the treatment of PDN.

Opioids, while effective in the short term, are discouraged for use in the treatment of chronic noncancer pain. In a systematic review by the CDC, there was weak to nonexistent evidence for the long-term efficacy of opioids for the treatment of chronic pain. Instead, long-term opioid use was found to be associated with adverse consequences including addiction and opioid-induced hyperalgesia. Interestingly, tapentadol which exerts its effect by both opioids and SNRI-based mechanisms was found to be effective in the treatment of painful diabetic neuropathy and has an FDA indication for this condition. However, due to the adverse consequences of long-term opioid use, this medication is discouraged by several societies.

At large, all the agents from the SNRI, gabapentinoids, and TCA classes have similar efficacy on neuropathic pain. However, there are agent-specific differences in side effects. Additionally, some of the agents have multiple indications, including depression and anxiety. Clinicians should be mindful of these differences in selecting appropriate medication. While many of these medications are effective for the treatment of PDN, complete elimination of pain is not realistic. Clinicians should have a discussion with patients in setting reasonable analgesic expectations. When initiating an agent, it is advisable to slowly titrate the agent to the effective dose to avoid intolerance and if therapeutic efficacy is not achieved after increasing the dose to the maximum allowable dose for the duration of 12 weeks, the medication can be considered inefficacious. Clinicians should not prematurely declare an agent ineffective when the dose has not been escalated to an appropriate level and the agent has not been tried for an appropriate duration.

### Neuropathic pain responds better to increased doses of pregabalin: an in-depth analysis of flexible-dose clinical trials [^112SvJsx]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

Pregabalin is recommended as a treatment for diverse neuropathic pain conditions,–where it is advised that it be carefully escalated to the optimal dose. In the USA, the maximum approved dose of pregabalin is 300 mg/day for DPN and 600 mg/day for PHN, while in Europe it is 600 mg/day for all neuropathic pain. Despite this, many patients may not receive the most effective dose of pregabalin, with a recent drug utilization study in the UK indicating that the approximate median prescribed dose of pregabalin for neuropathic pain was only 150 mg/day. This analysis provides evidence that new patients will tend to respond with every increase in pregabalin dose.

Neuropathic pain can be challenging to treat effectively. While there are a number of treatment options, not all are effective in all patients. For instance, data on the efficacy of pregabalin in patients with lower back pain are inconsistent. In a randomized withdrawal trial, pregabalin was not shown to be effective in patients with chronic lumbosacral radiculopathy. Even for those conditions where its efficacy is well established, many patients will not respond to treatment with pregabalin. As physicians are advised to ensure that effective and tolerable treatment for neuropathic pain is initiated as soon as possible, it is important to ascertain quickly if a treatment is ineffective so that other options can be tested. In these circumstances, it may be understandable why the time is not taken to escalate some patients to a higher, efficacious dose of pregabalin. However, of the 701 patients in this analysis who took the 150 mg/day dosing, 136 (19.4%) responded at that dose. Of those who continued to higher doses, 231 (33.0%) responded at a higher dose. These data do not correct for the tendency for higher doses to be used when patients have inadequate response at a lower dose. The MSM analyses make some correction for this tendency in dose escalation and indicate that it can be worthwhile to persist with pregabalin until the dose that delivers optimal analgesia and tolerable side effects is utilized.

### Safety profile and tolerability of up to 1 year of pregabalin treatment in 3 open-label extension studies in patients with fibromyalgia [^117GXpQ1]. Clinical Therapeutics (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Pain relief and an acceptable safety profile have been reported in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of pregabalin in the treatment of fibromyalgia (FM) for up to 14 weeks.

Objective

To evaluate the safety profile and tolerability of pregabalin (75–300 mg BID) treatment for up to 1 year in patients with FM.

Methods

Twelve-week data were pooled from 3 open-label extension studies of pivotal RCTs. Study 1 was a 1-year extension of a 13-week RCT, and studies 2 and 3 were 12-week extensions of 14-week RCTs. The 1-year data were separately evaluated. The open-label data are summarized using descriptive statistics.

Results

Overall, 1206 patients (92.4% female) with a mean (SD) age of 48.8 (10.7) years received open-label extended pregabalin treatment. A total of 119 of 1206 patients (9.9%) permanently discontinued study participation due to treatment-emergent adverse events (all causality) at 12 weeks (pooled data) and 53 of 429 (12.4%) within 1 year. Consistent with previous RCTs, the most commonly reported treatment-emergent adverse events with open-label pregabalin treatment were dizziness, somnolence, headache, peripheral edema, and increased weight. The highest incidence rates in the pooled 12-week data were for dizziness (214 of 1206; 17.7%) and somnolence (96 of 1206; 8.0%). In ratings of severity (mild, moderate, severe), most were reported as mild to moderate. The mean (SD) change in patient-reported visual analog scale pain scores (0–100) from the open-label baseline to the end of treatment was -21 (30.5) in study 1 (1 year), -26.7 (28.8) in study 2 (12 weeks), and -20.1 (26.8) in study 3 (12 weeks).

Conclusions

The data from these extension studies suggest that the adverse event safety profile and tolerability of patients with FM treated with open-label pregabalin (75–300 mg BID) for up to 1 year were stable and were consistent with those of previous studies. ClinicalTrials.gov identifiers: NCT00151528 (A0081057 [study 1]), NCT00282997 (A0081078 [study 2]), and NCT00346034 (A0081101 [study 3]).

### Pregabalin in the management of painful diabetic neuropathy: a narrative review [^116f5jjo]. Diabetes Therapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Pregabalin is structurally related to the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA; however, its mechanism of action is distinct from GABAergic modulation and is yet to be fully elucidated. Pain relief usually occurs within 1 week of initiating therapy and is thought to be mediated via high-affinity binding to the alpha2-delta subunit (α₂δ) of voltage-gated calcium channels at the presynaptic terminals. This results in modulation of the release of excitatory neurotransmitters such as glutamate through the glutamate synthesising enzyme, branched-chain amino acid transaminase.

Pregabalin's mechanism of action is similar to that of gabapentin; however, it has 2–4 times more potency and thus a lower dosing strategy is required. Typically starting doses range from 75 to 150 mg per day for neuropathic pain, with relatively quick up-titration over several weeks to maximal tolerated doses (600 mg/day) due to the more linear pharmacokinetics compared with gabapentin. It has high bioavailability (≥ 90% rapidly absorbed) with a half-life of approximately 9 h. Very common adverse effects (> 10% of patients) include dizziness, somnolence and headache. Pregabalin demonstrates quick absorption, reducing the probability of drug-drug interactions as it is not bound to plasma proteins and does not undergo first-pass metabolism in the liver. Although pregabalin poses low risk for addiction and drug dependence at therapeutic doses, recent statistics in England and Wales showed a > 20-fold increase in the number of deaths linked to pregabalin — 4 to 111 deaths from 2012 to 2016, whilst for gabapentin — 8 to 59 deaths during the same period. Rapid rise in mortality is associated with individuals with previous history of recreational polydrug misuse, or misuse in combination with opioids, as some report self-administration of dosages in excess (e.g. up to 10–20 times) of clinically advisable dosages. Consequently, this led to guidance from Public Health England and the NHS on safe prescribing of both pregabalin and gabapentin. However, in December 2017 NHS England launched a consultation to seek views on whether to schedule pregabalin and gabapentin as Controlled drugs in the UK. A similar consultation is underway with the WHO and a decision is expected in early 2019. Due to their "risk of addiction, potential illegal diversion and medicinal misuse" by a minority, the reclassification of these drugs will have major repercussions on the many millions of people suffering from neuropathic pain, as it will restrict prescribing and also prevent them from acquiring the drug on a repeat prescription.

### Pregabalin (Lyrica) [^113QG3b2]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.8 Weight Gain

LYRICA treatment may cause weight gain. In LYRICA controlled clinical trials in adult patients of up to 14 weeks, a gain of 7% or more over baseline weight was observed in 9% of LYRICA‑treated patients and 2% of placebo-treated patients. Few patients treated with LYRICA (0.3%) withdrew from controlled trials due to weight gain. LYRICA associated weight gain was related to dose and duration of exposure but did not appear to be associated with baseline BMI, gender, or age. Weight gain was not limited to patients with edema [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].

Although weight gain was not associated with clinically important changes in blood pressure in short-term controlled studies, the long-term cardiovascular effects of LYRICA-associated weight gain are unknown.

Among diabetic patients, LYRICA-treated patients gained an average of 1.6 kg (range: -16 to 16 kg), compared to an average 0.3 kg (range: -10 to 9 kg) weight gain in placebo patients. In a cohort of 333 diabetic patients who received LYRICA for at least 2 years, the average weight gain was 5.2 kg.

While the effects of LYRICA-associated weight gain on glycemic control have not been systematically assessed, in controlled and longer-term open label clinical trials with diabetic patients, LYRICA treatment did not appear to be associated with loss of glycemic control (as measured by HbA1C).

5.9 Tumorigenic Potential

In standard preclinical in vivo lifetime carcinogenicity studies of LYRICA, an unexpectedly high incidence of hemangiosarcoma was identified in two different strains of mice [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. The clinical significance of this finding is unknown. Clinical experience during LYRICA's premarketing development provides no direct means to assess its potential for inducing tumors in humans.

In clinical studies across various patient populations, comprising 6396 patient-years of exposure in patients greater than 12 years of age, new or worsening-preexisting tumors were reported in 57 patients. Without knowledge of the background incidence and recurrence in similar populations not treated with LYRICA, it is impossible to know whether the incidence seen in these cohorts is or is not affected by treatment.

### Cardiovascular risk of gabapentin and pregabalin in patients with diabetic neuropathy [^113JCu54]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

We identified an increased risk of adverse cardiovascular events associated with use of gabapentin and pregabalin in patients with diabetic neuropathy. Our findings need to be verified in other populations of gabapentin and pregabalin users and with other medications that cause fluid retention. If our results are generalizable, increased risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes, along with other side effects, the efficacy of pain control and the degree of tolerance of the patient, should inform the decision-making process when prescribing gabapentin, pregabalin, and perhaps other medications that cause fluid retention.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of low back pain [^115NKa7R]. DoD/VA (2022). High credibility.

VA/DoD low back pain guideline — pharmacotherapy advises specific use and avoidance statements. For chronic low back pain, we suggest duloxetine; for low back pain, we suggest nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against gabapentin or pregabalin for patients with low back pain with or without radicular symptoms, tricyclic antidepressants for low back pain, topical preparations for chronic low back pain, and for acute low back pain a non-benzodiazepine muscle relaxant for short-term use. The guideline further states we suggest against offering a non-benzodiazepine muscle relaxant for chronic low back pain, and we suggest against acetaminophen, monoclonal antibodies, opioids (with the note: for patients who are already using long-term opioids, see the VA/DoD CPG for the Use of Opioids in the Management of Chronic Pain), and for patients with low back pain with or without radicular symptoms we suggest against systemic corticosteroids (oral or intramuscular injection). For patients with low back pain, we recommend against benzodiazepines.

### Pregabalin (pregabalin extended release) [^113CTKy1]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as one week after starting drug treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed.

The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5 to 100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed.

Table 3 shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs.

The relative risk for suicidal thoughts or behavior was higher in clinical trials for epilepsy than in clinical trials for psychiatric or other conditions, but the absolute risk differences were similar for the epilepsy and psychiatric indications.

Anyone considering prescribing pregabalin extended-release tablets must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with the risk of untreated illness. Many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Should suicidal thoughts and behavior emerge during treatment, the prescriber needs to consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated.

Inform patients, their caregivers, and families that pregabalin extended-release tablets can increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and advise them of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of the signs and symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Report behaviors of concern immediately to healthcare providers.

### Benefit and harm of pregabalin in acute pain treatment: a systematic review with meta-analyses and trial sequential analyses [^116qRtVV]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2017). Low credibility.

Pregabalin has demonstrated anti-hyperalgesic properties and was introduced into acute pain treatment in 2001. Our aim was to evaluate the beneficial and harmful effects of pregabalin in postoperative pain management. We included randomized clinical trials investigating perioperative pregabalin treatment in adult surgical patients. The review followed Cochrane methodology, including Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE), and used trial sequential analyses (TSAs). The primary outcomes were 24h morphine i.v. consumption and the incidence of serious adverse events (SAEs) defined by International Conference of Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice guidelines. Conclusions were based primarily on trials with low risk of bias. Ninety-seven randomized clinical trials with 7201 patients were included. The 24h morphine i.v. consumption was reported in 11 trials with overall low risk of bias, finding a reduction of 5.8mg (3.2, 8.5; TSA adjusted confidence interval: 3.2, 8.5). Incidence of SAEs was reported in 21 trials, with 55 SAEs reported in 12 of these trials, and 22 SAEs reported in 10 trials with overall low risk of bias. In trials with overall low risk of bias, Peto's odds ratio was 2.9 (1.2, 6.8; TSA adjusted confidence interval: 0.1, 97.1). Based on trials with low risk of bias, pregabalin may have a minimal opioid-sparing effect, but the risk of SAEs seems increased. However, the GRADE-rated evaluations showed only moderate to very low quality of evidence. Consequently, a routine use of pregabalin for postoperative pain treatment cannot be recommended.

### Pregabalin for the management of fibromyalgia syndrome [^113t8oU2]. Journal of Pain Research (2010). Low credibility.

This last article in a three-part series on approved medications for managing fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) reviews pregabalin (Lyrica(®)). Pregabalin was the first drug approved for FMS management and, as an anticonvulsant, differs from the other approved agents that are antidepressants. Pregabalin inhibits presynaptic excitatory neurotransmitter release by blocking α(2)δ calcium channels. Five randomized, placebo-controlled trials have demonstrated pregabalin reduces pain and improves sleep and health-related quality of life in FMS patients. While indicated dosing is 300–450 mg divided twice daily, initial dosing of 25–50 mg at night is recommended owing to side effects including somnolence, dizziness, and cognitive dysfunction. Since side effects such as weight gain and peripheral edema are dose-related, uptitration in weekly increments based on tolerability and therapeutic response is recommended. Due to its lack of protein binding and negligible hepatic metabolism, pregabalin can be safely combined with other medications and used in patients with renal failure when the dose is appropriate. Pregabalin may worsen sedation when combined with central nervous system depressants. Pregabalin should be discontinued gradually. Pregabalin-treated patients should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior. Pregabalin in combination with the other approved medications may be synergistic in treating FMS.

### Pregabalin: a new neuromodulator with broad therapeutic indications [^114E4zEj]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To review pregabalin's pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and adverse effects in the treatment of neuropathic pain, epilepsy, and anxiety.

Data Sources

A MEDLINE search (1993-October 2005) for peer-reviewed English-language publications was performed. Abstracts from professional meetings were also included. Key terms were anxiety, diabetic neuropathy, epilepsy, neuropathic pain, postherpetic neuralgia, pregabalin, and seizures.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Basic pharmacology data were extracted from animal studies; pharmacokinetic data were extracted from human studies. Multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group studies were included to describe the efficacy and adverse effects of pregabalin.

Data Synthesis

Pregabalin is a new agent that exerts its pharmacodynamic effect by modulating voltage-gated calcium channels. Pregabalin has a linear pharmacokinetic profile. It is completely absorbed, not bound to plasma proteins, not metabolized, and eliminated unchanged through the kidneys. Doses must be adjusted in patients with renal insufficiency. Clinical trials showed that pregabalin is effective in neuropathic pain associated with postherpetic neuralgia, diabetic peripheral neuropathy, in partial epilepsy as adjunctive therapy, and in generalized and social anxiety disorders. The most common adverse effects were dizziness and somnolence. Few serious adverse effects were reported. Pregabalin should not be discontinued rapidly.

Conclusions

Pregabalin is an effective and safe analgesic, antiepileptic, and anxiolytic medicine. It will provide a new treatment option for patients with neuropathic pain and partial epilepsy.

### Efficacy of pregabalin in post-traumatic peripheral neuropathic pain: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial [^113Mht98]. Journal of Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study of patients with PTNP did not demonstrate a statistically significant treatment effect with pregabalin on mean pain intensity scores at the prespecified primary efficacy endpoint of the study, week 15. However, the primary efficacy parameter (change in mean pain intensity scores) was statistically significant at most other time points, and several secondary outcomes related to analgesic efficacy and quality of life improved with pregabalin compared with placebo treatment. Pregabalin was superior to placebo in reducing pain severity and interference with daily function as measured by the BPI-sf. A significantly greater number of patients in the pregabalin group described their overall status as very much improved or much improved when comparing their assessment on the PGIC during the last week of treatment (i.e. week 15) to that at study outset. Finally, there was a consistent and significant reduction in pain interference with sleep over the course of the study.

### Real-life efficacy of pregabalin for the treatment of peripheral neuropathic pain in daily clinical practice in Denmark: the NEP-TUNE study [^116VZrmf]. Journal of Pain Research (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

The objective of this study was to assess the use and efficacy of pregabalin in the treatment of patients with peripheral NeP in real-life daily clinical practice. The patient group investigated was a difficult-to-treat group of patients with the majority having a long (> 12 months) history of NeP. Moreover, a large proportion of the patients had previously been treated with TCA and/or gabapentin.

Registration of pregabalin treatment throughout the study showed that dose escalation occurred in the primary and secondary care as expected. However, the dosages used (average dose of 241 mg/d after 3 months of treatment) were generally lower than the recommended daily defined dose of 300 mg. They were also lower than the dosages typically used in pregabalin randomized controlled trials, including trials where patients were allowed to titrate. One explanation for the lower average dose of pregabalin in this study is that some clinics enrolled many elderly people, primarily women, for whom uptitration of the pregabalin dosage started from a lower level and only slowly increased. A further argument could be that the period of observation was only 3 months, whereas a longer observation period, for example, 6 months, would have contributed to a higher dosage level of pregabalin. However, a previous study with a 6-month observation period has not been able to confirm this.

### Pregabalin [^114WmLAb]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

The most common dose-related adverse reactions (> 5%) with pregabalin in this study were somnolence, pneumonia, and viral infection [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

Juvenile Animal Data

In studies in which pregabalin (50 to 500 mg/kg) was orally administered to young rats from early in the postnatal period (Postnatal Day 7) through sexual maturity, neurobehavioral abnormalities (deficits in learning and memory, altered locomotor activity, decreased auditory startle responding and habituation) and reproductive impairment (delayed sexual maturation and decreased fertility in males and females) were observed at doses greater than or equal to 50 mg/kg. The neurobehavioral changes of acoustic startle persisted at greater than or equal to 250 mg/kg and locomotor activity and water maze performance at greater than or equal to 500 mg/kg in animals tested after cessation of dosing and, thus, were considered to represent long-term effects. The low effect dose for developmental neurotoxicity and reproductive impairment in juvenile rats (50 mg/kg) was associated with a plasma pregabalin exposure (AUC) approximately equal to human exposure at the maximum recommended dose of 600 mg/day. A no-effect dose was not established.

### Efficacy of pregabalin in post-traumatic peripheral neuropathic pain: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial [^113yX81H]. Journal of Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

This was the first large phase 3, randomized, controlled trial designed to evaluate the analgesic efficacy of pregabalin in PTNP for registration purposes in the United States. The conduct of this trial indicates that a large, multinational, phase 3 trial of pregabalin in PTNP is feasible. The significant effect of pregabalin on a number of secondary endpoints, including second measure of pain intensity (BPI-sf) raises the possibility that the absence of a statistically significant difference on the primary endpoint may be partly attributed to additional factors individually or in aggregate including (1) the study design, (2) dose titration, (3) adequacy of dose achieved, (4) duration of the fixed dose period, (5) the number and wide geographical location of study sites needed to conduct the study, (6) the level of refractoriness of the study population, and (7) differential response to study treatments over time in study, particularly the placebo response. A review of randomized, parallel-group, placebo-controlled trials in neuropathic pain found that the magnitude of the placebo response accrues slowly and continually, whereas pain reduction in response to active treatments manifests more rapidly, before leveling off. Such a pattern of placebo response occurred over the course of the present study and possibly explains why pregabalin demonstrated a significant treatment effect on mean pain intensity in earlier weeks, but not in the primary analysis at week 15. Moreover, the efficacy of pregabalin observed in the earlier weeks of this trial is consistent with the results from a prior, shorter trial with an 8-week double-blind period. Although subjects in this study by Van Seventer et al. had an equally diverse set of etiologic mechanisms associated with chronic neuropathic pain, it should also be noted that the duration of the syndromes was nearly 50% shorter (4.4 vs 8 years in this study) and, therefore, the studies may not be strictly comparable.

### Pregabalin for chronic noncancer pain-when pain relief comes at a cardiac cost… [^112mTJwx]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

In addition to using inverse probability of treatment weighting to adjust for an extensive list of 231 covariates to reduce confounding, the authors also attempted to closely emulate a hypothetical target trial. According to the results, the incidence of HF-related hospitalizations or emergency department visits was significantly higher among patients treated with pregabalin compared with those receiving gabapentin. The difference was even more pronounced in patients with a history of cardiovascular disease, with an AHR of 1.
85. An increased risk for outpatient HF diagnoses was also seen, although all-cause mortality did not differ significantly between groups. The authors should be congratulated for conducting a large, well-designed study that addresses an area of ongoing clinical uncertainty, whereas prior studies have produced conflicting findings.

2–4 The study by Park et al1 aligns with mechanistic data and regulatory observations. Pregabalin, although structurally related to gabapentin, binds with greater affinity to α₂δ subunits of voltage-gated calcium channels — subunits that are also expressed in vascular smooth muscle and cardiac myocytes. 5 This binding could contribute to fluid retention and potential exacerbation of subclinical cardiac dysfunction. Notably, in the study by Park et al, 1 the HF incidence in the pregabalin group was 18. 2 per 1000 person-years and in the gabapentin group was
12. 5 per 1000 person-years, translating to approximately 6 additional HF events annually for every 1000 patients treated with pregabalin. One strength of the study by Park et al1 is its restriction to patients without prior HF; thereby, the study assessed the incidence of new onset, rather than recurrence, of HF.

This is a critical distinction, as many previous studies have largely focused on worsening HF in patients with preexisting HF. 2, 4 In contrast to the current study, several prior studies found no association between pregabalin use and an increased risk of HF. 2–4 However, these studies were limited by smaller sample sizes and less rigorous methodologic approaches, potentially reducing their ability to detect clinically meaningful differences.

### CDC clinical practice guideline for prescribing opioids for pain-United States, 2022 [^111Dk73k]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Supporting Rationale

Benzodiazepines and opioids both cause central nervous system depression, and benzodiazepines can potentiate opioid-induced decreases in respiratory drive. Epidemiologic studies find concurrent benzodiazepine use in large proportions of opioid-related overdose deaths. The clinical evidence reviews identified three cohort studies that found an association between concurrent use of benzodiazepines and opioids versus opioids alone and increased risk for overdose. A case-cohort study found concurrent benzodiazepine prescription with opioid prescription to be associated with a near-quadrupling of risk for overdose death compared with opioid prescription alone. The clinical evidence reviews did not find studies evaluating the effectiveness of avoiding coprescribing of benzodiazepines and opioids on risk for overdose. The clinical evidence reviews identified three observational studies that found an association between concurrent use of gabapentinoids and opioids versus opioids alone and increased risk for overdose, with higher risks at increased gabapentinoid doses.

Experts from OWG noted that rather than necessarily being a direct cause of overdose, benzodiazepines might serve as a marker of risk for overdose because of underlying conditions, in specific situations benzodiazepines can be beneficial, and that stopping benzodiazepines can be destabilizing. In addition, experts noted that long-term, stable use might be safer than erratic, unpredictable use. Because of these considerations, multiple experts indicated that recommending extreme caution with concurrent prescription of opioid pain medications and benzodiazepines was more appropriate than a recommendation to avoid prescribing opioid pain medication and benzodiazepines concurrently and that category B would be more appropriate than category A for this recommendation.

Although in certain circumstances it might be appropriate to prescribe opioids to a patient receiving benzodiazepines (e.g. severe acute pain in a patient taking long-term, stable low-dosage benzodiazepine therapy), clinicians should use particular caution when prescribing opioid pain medication and benzodiazepines concurrently. In addition, because other central nervous system depressants (e.g. muscle relaxants, nonbenzodiazepine sedative hypnotics, and potentially sedating anticonvulsant medications such as gabapentin and pregabalin) can potentiate respiratory depression associated with opioids, clinicians should consider whether benefits outweigh risks of concurrent use of these medications. Clinicians should check PDMPs for concurrent controlled medications prescribed by other clinicians (see Recommendation 9) and should consider involving pharmacists as part of the management team when opioids are coprescribed with other central nervous system depressants.

### Short-term incubation of gabapentin or pregabalin does not affect chemically induced injury in neuronal cell models in vitro [^111VjZzu]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion

The goal of this study was to examine the potentially cytotoxic effects of gabapentinoids on the cytoskeleton and cellular integrity of autonomic and sensory neuronal cultures. Results suggest that both pregabalin and gabapentin are unlikely to induce, enhance, or improve gross neurotoxicity when employed for a short period in clinically relevant doses. Furthermore, both drugs are unlikely to induce changes in the morphology and cytoskeleton of autonomic and sensory neurons either. This study hence supports the idea that the gray matter alterations observed in brains of patients with neuropathic pain are related to the disease process itself, rather than a consequence of the medicines given. However, future research should confirm these findings for prolonged drug applications in more complex cellular models.

### An open-label, long-term study examining the safety and tolerability of pregabalin in Japanese patients with central neuropathic pain [^111cCP8h]. Journal of Pain Research (2014). Low credibility.

The frequency of weight gain as a treatment-related AE in the current study (28.2%) was higher than that reported for previous short-term studies of pregabalin in patients with spinal cord injury (3.3%), or post-stroke pain (5.5%). The current observed incidence of weight gain as an AE was also higher than that reported during long-term, open-label trials of pregabalin in Japanese patients with DPN (22.0%)or PHN (13.5%). Likewise, the frequency of treatment-related peripheral edema was higher in the current trial (17.5%) than in the previous short-term trials in patients with spinal cord injury (8.8%), or post-stroke pain (8.2%). However, the incidence of peripheral edema reported here was similar to that reported for long-term studies of pregabalin patients with DPN (15.4%)or PHN (16.7%). Most instances of treatment-related weight gain (mild n = 28, moderate n = 1, severe n = 0) and peripheral edema (mild n = 17, moderate n = 1, severe n = 0) in the current study were mild in severity and no patients discontinued treatment due to either weight gain or peripheral edema.

In all patients combined, pregabalin treatment improved pain at endpoint compared with baseline. This was evident for all aspects of the SF-MPQ, which assesses severity of pain, as well as the mBPI-10, which measures how pain interferes with patient function. Notably, improvements in SF-MPQ VAS score were evident as early as week 2 and were sustained throughout the full treatment period. Improvements in SF-MPQ VAS score and mBPI-10 total score were evident in each patient population. The proportion of patients achieving at least a 30% decrease in SF-MPQ VAS pain score from baseline to endpoint was 40.0% in multiple sclerosis patients, 28.9% in spinal cord injury patients, and 50.0% in post-stroke patients. Improvements in other aspects of the SF-MPQ were observed in patients with spinal cord injury and post-stroke pain, but were not evident in patients with multiple sclerosis. However, the small number of patients with multiple sclerosis enrolled in this study (n = 5) makes it difficult to draw conclusions regarding the effects of pregabalin in this specific patient population.

### Safety and efficacy of pregabalin in adolescents with fibromyalgia: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial and a 6-month open-label extension study [^117PZ9sx]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Study medication

Subjects were randomized 1:1 to receive pregabalin or matched placebo according to a computer-generated pseudorandom code using the method of random permuted blocks. Pregabalin or matched placebo was administered orally twice daily. In both studies, subjects were started at 75 mg/day from the end of week 1 and escalated at each week over a 3-week period, based on investigator assessment of safety and tolerability, to an optimized dose of 75 mg/day, 150 mg/day, 300 mg/day, or 450 mg/day. Subjects in the double-blind study received their optimized dose for the 12-week maintenance phase while subjects in the open-label study could have their dose adjusted throughout the 6 months of their study.

### The efficacy and safety of pregabalin in the treatment of neuropathic pain associated with chronic lumbosacral radiculopathy [^112VcRDA]. Pain (2010). Low credibility.

We evaluated the efficacy of pregabalin in patients with chronic lumbosacral radiculopathy. This randomized, controlled, withdrawal trial included five phases: screening (4–18 days); run-in (4–10 days) to screen out placebo responders; single-blind (28 days) to identify pregabalin responders; double-blind to randomize responders to pregabalin or placebo (35 days); and final study medication taper (7 days). The primary endpoint was time to loss of response (LOR) during the double-blind phase (1-point increase in pain, discontinuation, or rescue-medication use). In the single-blind phase, 58% of patients had 30% pain reduction. In the double-blind phase, pregabalin (n = 110) and placebo (n = 107) groups did not differ significantly in time to LOR. Adverse events caused the discontinuation of 9.9% and 5.6% of pregabalin-treated and placebo-treated patients, respectively. Most patients with chronic lumbosacral radiculopathy responded to pregabalin therapy; however, time to LOR did not significantly differ between pregabalin and placebo. Considering the results of all phases of the study, it is difficult to draw definitive conclusions from it, suggesting a need for further work to understand the clinical potential of pregabalin treatment for lumbosacral radiculopathy.

### Temporal analysis of pain responders and common adverse events: when do these first appear following treatment with pregabalin [^116csQsW]. Journal of Pain Research (2015). Low credibility.

A prior analysis of 31 clinical trials of pregabalin in patients with peripheral neuropathic pain conditions demonstrated that the majority of incidences of some common AEs were transient and resolved prior to the end of their study. For dizziness and somnolence, respectively, median times to resolution were 9.0 and 14.0 days, with 74.5% and 64.8% of incidences resolving prior to the end of the study. Although it was not a part of the current analysis, this suggests that the majority of cases of somnolence and dizziness would emerge, and then improve or resolve, within the first 4–6 weeks of treatment.

The data in this analysis suggest that the majority of new responders and new AEs emerge within the first 3–4 weeks of treatment with pregabalin. These data could advise researchers planning new proof-of-concept studies of pregabalin in pain conditions and also guide clinical management of patients with DPN, PHN, neuropathic pain due to SCI, and FM.

### Pregabalin (pregabalin extended release) [^113C82sT]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

5.9 Tumorigenic Potential

In standard preclinical in vivo lifetime carcinogenicity studies of pregabalin, an unexpectedly high incidence of hemangiosarcoma was identified in 2 different strains of mice [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. The clinical significance of this finding is unknown. Clinical experience during premarketing development of LYRICA provides no direct means to assess its potential for inducing tumors in humans.

In clinical studies across various patient populations, comprising 6396 patient-years of exposure in patients greater than 12 years of age, new or worsening-preexisting tumors were reported in 57 patients. Without knowledge of the background incidence and recurrence in similar populations not treated with pregabalin, it is impossible to know whether the incidence seen in these cohorts is or is not affected by treatment.

5.10 Ophthalmological Effects

In controlled studies for pain indications, 4.8% of patients treated with pregabalin extended-release tablets in the single-blind phase reported blurred vision, which resolved in a majority of cases with continued dosing. Less than 1% of patients discontinued pregabalin extended-release tablets treatment due to vision-related events (primarily blurred vision). Additionally, 0.7% of pregabalin extended-release tablets-treated patients as compared to no placebo-treated patients experienced blurred vision in the double-blind phase.

Prospectively planned ophthalmologic testing during the premarketing development of pregabalin, including visual acuity testing, formal visual field testing and dilated funduscopic examination, was performed in over 3600 patients. In these patients, visual acuity was reduced in 7% of LYRICA-treated patients and 5% of placebo-treated patients. Visual field changes were detected in 13% of LYRICA-treated and 12% of placebo-treated patients. Funduscopic changes were observed in 2% of LYRICA-treated and 2% of placebo-treated patients.

Although the clinical significance of the ophthalmologic findings is unknown, inform patients to notify their physician if changes in vision occur. If visual disturbance persists, consider further assessment. Consider more frequent assessment for patients who are already routinely monitored for ocular conditions.

### Delirium following pregabalin discontinuation in an individual with no psychiatric or substance use history [^115NM3Zb]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

Background

Pregabalin, a γ-amino butyric acid (GABA) analogue, is approved in the USA for treating fibromyalgia, various forms of neuropathic pain and partial onset seizures. Additionally, it is prescribed off-label for a range of clinical conditions, with recent trends indicating a surge in its off-label utilisation. Review articles and case studies have highlighted the potential for pregabalin abuse, and multiple cases have documented withdrawal symptoms following its sudden cessation. This case emphasises the importance for clinicians to recognise potential misuse of pregabalin to educate patients while prescribing pregabalin and to be cognisant of severe symptoms that might arise from its abrupt discontinuation.

### Pregabalin capsules, cv [^111U5KiL]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

The most common dose-related adverse reactions (> 5%) with pregabalin in this study were somnolence, pneumonia, and viral infection [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

Juvenile Animal Data

In studies in which pregabalin (50 to 500 mg/kg) was orally administered to young rats from early in the postnatal period (Postnatal Day 7) through sexual maturity, neurobehavioral abnormalities (deficits in learning and memory, altered locomotor activity, decreased auditory startle responding and habituation) and reproductive impairment (delayed sexual maturation and decreased fertility in males and females) were observed at doses greater than or equal to 50 mg/kg. The neurobehavioral changes of acoustic startle persisted at greater than or equal to 250 mg/kg and locomotor activity and water maze performance at greater than or equal to 500 mg/kg in animals tested after cessation of dosing and, thus, were considered to represent long-term effects. The low effect dose for developmental neurotoxicity and reproductive impairment in juvenile rats (50 mg/kg) was associated with a plasma pregabalin exposure (AUC) approximately equal to human exposure at the maximum recommended dose of 600 mg/day. A no-effect dose was not established.

### Pregabalin in patients with central neuropathic pain: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of a flexible-dose regimen [^113bRZvG]. Pain (2008). Low credibility.

The effective treatment of patients suffering from central neuropathic pain remains a clinical challenge, despite a standard pharmacological approach in combination with anticonvulsants and antidepressants. A randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial evaluated the effects of pregabalin on pain relief, tolerability, health status, and quality of life in patients with central neuropathic pain caused by brain or spinal cord injuries. At baseline and 4 weeks after the start of treatment subjects were evaluated with standard measures of efficacy: pain intensity measured by visual analog scale, health status (Pain Disability Index and EQ-5D) and quality of life (SF-36). Forty patients received escalating doses of either pregabalin (150, 300, and 600mg/day) or matching placebo capsules. In both groups, patients started with 1 capsule per day (either 150mg of pregabalin or placebo). If pain relief was insufficient, patients were titrated to a higher dose. There was a statistically significant decrease in mean pain score at endpoint for pregabalin treatment, compared with placebo (P = 0.016). Follow-up observation showed no significant difference in Pain Disability Index scores between the two groups. The pregabalin group, however, showed a statistically significant improvement for the EQ-5D. Pregabalin treatment led to a significant improvement in the bodily pain domain of the SF36. In the other domains, more favorable scores were reported without reaching statistical significance. Pregabalin, in a flexible-dose regime, produced clinically significant reductions in pain, as well as improvements in health status in patients suffering from severe central neuropathic pain.
