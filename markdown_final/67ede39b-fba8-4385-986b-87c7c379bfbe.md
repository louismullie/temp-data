testing for genital herpes

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to test for genital herpes. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the initial assessment and the limits of clinical diagnosis. Then, I should verify the optimal tests for patients with lesions versus those without. Next, I will review controversies in screening asymptomatic patients, followed by targeted recommendations in pregnancy and HIV. After that, I need to consider how to interpret results and counsel patients. Finally, I will double-check special issues such as neonatal testing and resistance in immunocompromised hosts to ensure completeness [^116zd5PJ] [^114ENDwe] [^112KeUzV] [^116GuR8V].

> Let me first confirm the initial clinical assessment priorities. I need to distinguish whether the patient has active genital ulcers or vesicles versus no current lesions, and I should not over-rely on exam features alone because clinical diagnosis is insensitive and misses many active shedders, so laboratory confirmation is crucial to avoid misclassification and missed counseling opportunities [^115Yqq2p] [^117W8KUa].

> With lesions present, I should verify the preferred diagnostic strategy. Hold on, let me not jump to conclusions — viral culture used to be standard, but type-specific nucleic acid amplification testing (PCR/NAAT) on a swab of the lesion base is now preferred for its superior sensitivity and ability to distinguish HSV-1 from HSV-2, and I should obtain the specimen promptly and not delay empiric therapy if clinical suspicion is high while awaiting results [^116zd5PJ] [^112V9ecq] [^117K7Udo].

> Wait, I almost recommended obtaining routine blood PCR for adults with suspected genital HSV, but I need to check assay availability and indications. FDA-cleared HSV assays are limited to CSF and cutaneous or mucocutaneous lesion swabs; blood-based HSV PCRs are laboratory-developed and generally reserved for special contexts such as neonatal disease or disseminated infection, so for uncomplicated genital presentations the lesion swab is the right test, not blood [^1117xU57] [^115yvpAc].

> If no lesions are present but the history or symptoms raise concern, I should consider type-specific serologic testing, but I need to ensure the assay is glycoprotein G–based to avoid false positives common with older, non-gG tests and to improve concordance with Western blot, which remains the reference method for difficult cases or discordant results [^1157fx7U] [^116D33iw] [^1121gRzg] [^111SeSPb] [^112166oi].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about screening everyone without symptoms. I should confirm guideline positions: the USPSTF gives a D recommendation against routine serologic screening for genital HSV in asymptomatic adolescents and adults, including pregnant persons, because of low positive predictive value in low-prevalence settings, potential psychological harms, and lack of evidence that screening reduces transmission, so universal screening is not advised [^114ENDwe] [^115XWYYE] [^115SCbDS].

> But wait, what if the patient is in a higher-risk situation or has a partner with known HSV? Let me reconsider selective testing: some expert groups support targeted, type-specific serology in motivated high-risk individuals, persons with HIV, or those with partners with genital herpes, provided pretest counseling addresses limitations and potential harms, even as I acknowledge the USPSTF stance against universal screening [^11595pSj] [^1157fx7U] [^116D33iw].

> For pregnancy, I should confirm two parallel tracks: screening and management. Routine serologic screening in asymptomatic pregnant patients is not recommended, yet targeted type-specific serology is reasonable if the pregnant patient has no HSV history and her partner has genital HSV, ideally early in pregnancy with repeat testing at 32–34 weeks to guide prevention counseling, while women with known recurrent HSV should start suppressive acyclovir or valacyclovir at 36 weeks to reduce lesions, shedding, and cesarean delivery, and first-episode genital HSV in the third trimester or active lesions at labor warrants discussion of Cesarean delivery to reduce neonatal exposure [^114ENDwe] [^112KeUzV] [^116LJZDg] [^111eK5yq] [^115SCbDS].

> I need to check neonatal testing implications. If the mother has active genital lesions at delivery, the neonate should be tested promptly, typically within 24–36 hours, recognizing there is no FDA-cleared HSV-1/2 blood NAAT and that many centers use validated laboratory-developed tests on whole blood in conjunction with other evaluations when neonatal HSV is a concern [^1117xU57] [^114NbMdv].

> For patients with HIV, I should confirm two priorities. First, advise HSV-2–seronegative patients with HIV to have partners tested with type-specific serology before sexual activity to reduce acquisition risk, and second, if recalcitrant lesions raise concern for acyclovir resistance, obtain a viral isolate for susceptibility testing to guide therapy, given higher rates of atypical disease and resistance in immunocompromised hosts [^111kt5Ks] [^116GuR8V].

> Interpreting results requires care. A positive lesion PCR confirms active infection and identifies the type, while HSV-2 seropositivity indicates established infection with lifelong antibody and a risk of asymptomatic shedding on roughly 9–13% of days in many cohorts, and I should remember that genital HSV-1 now accounts for a substantial share of first-episode disease in some populations, which affects prognosis and recurrence patterns and should be discussed in counseling [^113XbwAr] [^1169jm4R] [^114ZoUfW] [^1179eUbN].

> Hold on, I should verify what to say when results are discordant or suspicion remains high despite negative tests. Because shedding is intermittent and sampling can miss brief reactivation, repeat lesion NAAT if new lesions appear, or repeat type-specific serology in the window period, and consider high-sensitivity molecular assays where available to minimize false negatives and refine diagnosis [^113XbwAr] [^117K7Udo].

> Next, I should review counseling and management linked to test outcomes. Education about asymptomatic shedding, avoidance of sex during prodrome or lesions, consistent condom use, and consideration of daily suppressive antivirals for those with frequent recurrences or serodiscordant partners are key, with the understanding that reductions in genital shedding mediate much of the antiviral benefit on recurrences; "test of cure" is not recommended because HSV persists lifelong and management focuses on symptom control and transmission reduction [^115SCbDS] [^113sgWpF] [^115NZFPM].

Testing for genital herpes relies on **PCR from lesion swabs** as the preferred diagnostic method [^116zd5PJ] for its high sensitivity and specificity and its ability to distinguish HSV-1 from HSV-2 [^113e1HQ3] [^117K7Udo]. Serologic testing is **not recommended for routine screening** [^114ENDwe] in asymptomatic individuals because of the risk of false positives [^1121gRzg] and limited clinical utility [^115XWYYE]. Viral culture is less sensitive than PCR [^112V9ecq] and is mainly used when PCR is unavailable or for antiviral resistance testing [^116GuR8V]. In pregnancy, use type-specific serology when there is no HSV history but a partner with HSV [^112KeUzV], and use PCR for active lesions [^112m6zVK]; consider suppressive therapy at 36 weeks [^116LJZDg] and cesarean delivery to reduce neonatal risk [^111eK5yq].

---

## Clinical indications for testing

- **Symptomatic patients**: Patients presenting with genital ulcers [^111dQMhd], vesicles, or other lesions suggestive of HSV infection [^116zd5PJ].

- **Asymptomatic patients with high risk**: Patients with known exposure to HSV [^1157fx7U], such as sexual partners of individuals diagnosed with genital herpes [^11595pSj], or those with multiple sexual partners.

- **Pregnant women**: Particularly those without a history of HSV infection but with partners known to have genital herpes [^112KeUzV], to assess the risk of neonatal transmission.

## Diagnostic methods

| **Method** | **Description** | **Advantages** | **Limitations** |
|-|-|-|-|
| PCR | PCR is the preferred diagnostic method for genital herpes [^116zd5PJ] due to its high sensitivity and specificity. It detects HSV DNA directly from lesion swabs, allowing for accurate identification and differentiation between HSV-1 and HSV-2 [^113e1HQ3] | High sensitivity and specificity, rapid results, and ability to differentiate HSV-1 from HSV-2 | Requires specialized laboratory equipment and trained personnel |
| Viral culture | Viral culture involves isolating the virus from lesion samples. While historically considered the gold standard, it has lower sensitivity compared to PCR [^112V9ecq], particularly in recurrent or healing lesions | Useful for antiviral susceptibility testing, particularly in cases of suspected acyclovir resistance [^116GuR8V] | Lower sensitivity, longer turnaround time, and requires viable virus samples |
| Serologic testing | Serologic tests detect HSV-specific antibodies (IgG and IgM) in blood samples. Type-specific serologic tests [^112166oi] can differentiate between HSV-1 and HSV-2 infections | Useful for identifying asymptomatic infections or confirming past exposure | Not recommended for routine screening in asymptomatic individuals [^114ENDwe] due to potential false positives and limited clinical utility [^115XWYYE] |

---

## Recommended testing protocols

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended testing method** | **Additional considerations** |
|-|-|-|
| Symptomatic patients with active lesions | PCR from lesion swabs [^117K7Udo] | ∅ |
| Asymptomatic patients with known exposure | Type-specific serologic testing [^11595pSj] | Confirmatory testing may be required [^1121gRzg] |
| Pregnant women without HSV history but with HSV-positive partner | Type-specific serologic testing | Repeat testing [^112KeUzV] at 32–34 weeks gestation |
| Suspected antiviral resistance | Viral culture with susceptibility testing [^116GuR8V] | ∅ |

---

## Special considerations in pregnancy

- **Type-specific serologic testing**: Recommended for pregnant women without a history of HSV infection but with partners known to have genital herpes [^112KeUzV].

- **Suppressive therapy**: Initiate suppressive antiviral therapy (acyclovir or valacyclovir) at 36 weeks gestation [^116LJZDg] to reduce the risk of clinical lesions and viral shedding at delivery [^115SCbDS].

- **Cesarean delivery**: Consider cesarean delivery in cases of active lesions [^112m6zVK] or first symptomatic episodes during the third trimester [^111eK5yq].

---

## Limitations and challenges

- **Asymptomatic shedding**: HSV can be transmitted even in the absence of symptoms [^113XbwAr], complicating diagnosis and prevention efforts [^113tLF4D].

- **False positives**: Serologic tests may yield false positives [^114ENDwe], particularly in asymptomatic individuals, leading to potential psychological distress and unnecessary treatment [^111SeSPb].

- **Resource limitations**: PCR testing requires specialized equipment and trained personnel, which may not be available in all healthcare settings [^114zB7Pg].

---

PCR from lesion swabs is the **preferred diagnostic method** for genital herpes due to its high sensitivity and specificity [^116zd5PJ]. Serologic testing is not recommended for routine screening in asymptomatic individuals [^114ENDwe], whereas viral culture is primarily used for antiviral susceptibility testing [^116GuR8V]. Pregnancy requires special considerations to prevent neonatal transmission [^112KeUzV].

### The spectrum of genital herpes simplex virus infection in men attending a sexually transmitted disease clinic [^112V9ecq]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

The spectrum of genital herpes (GH) has been understudied in men, especially African American men.

- **Methods**: Consecutive men attending a sexually transmitted diseases clinic were enrolled in a study of GH epidemiology. Consenting participants answered questionnaires detailing their sexual and social activities and underwent serological testing for herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2 (HSV-1 and -2) and collection of genital swabs for viral detection.

- **Results**: Of the 516 men enrolled, 465 (90%) were African American. Antibodies to HSV-1 were present in 315 (61%) of participants, and 233 (45%) had antibodies to HSV-2. Factors associated with HSV-2 infection included older age and African American race. HSV was detected in genital swabs from 52 men; 43 (82.7%) swabs were HSV-2 positive, and 9 (17.3%) were HSV-1 positive. The overall viral shedding rate among men (n = 247) with evidence of GH (HSV-1 or HSV-2 infection) was 21.1%, and the asymptomatic shedding rate in this same group was 5.2%. The sensitivities of culture for detection of HSV-1 and HSV-2 were 0.22 and 0.58, respectively, compared with that of polymerase chain reaction.

- **Conclusions**: Genital HSV infections are common and largely unrecognized among this segment of the population. HSV-1 infection constitutes a nontrivial proportion of GH in these men.

### Performance evaluation of the Aptima HSV-1 and 2 assay for the detection of HSV in cutaneous and mucocutaneous lesion specimens [^113e1HQ3]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2017). Low credibility.

Timely and precise laboratory diagnosis of Herpes simplex viruses (HSV) is required to guide clinical management.

- **Objectives**: The study evaluated the limit of detection (LOD) and performance characteristics of the Aptima HSV-1 and 2 assay in comparison to four other assays.

- **Study design**: The multi-center study compared the qualitative detection of HSV-1 and 2 by the Aptima HSV-1 and 2 assay (Hologic) to the ELVIS culture, Lyra Direct (Quidel), AmpliVue (Quidel), and a laboratory-developed test (LDT). LOD was assessed using VTM and STM diluted viral concentrations, and clinical performance was evaluated using 505 swab specimens.

- **Results**: The Aptima LOD studies demonstrated a lower detection limit for STM specimens at 1450 copies/mL and 430 copies/mL for HSV-1 and HSV-2, respectively. The LOD for VTM specimens was 9370 copies/mL and 8045 copies/mL for HSV-1 and HSV-2, respectively. For positive consensus results, the Aptima assay showed a 95% percent positive agreement (PPA) and 100% negative percent agreement (NPA) for HSV-1, while the PPA and NPA for HSV-2 were 96% and 100%, respectively. AmpliVue exhibited a 1.8% invalid rate, whereas Lyra had no invalid results but a 0.8% inhibition rate. Both Aptima and LDT had no invalid or inhibited results.

- **Conclusion**: The results indicate that the Aptima HSV-1 and 2 assay is sensitive, and its performance characteristics are comparable to those of the assays analyzed for the detection and differentiation of HSV-1 and 2 from cutaneous and mucocutaneous lesions.

### Genome-wide surveillance of genital herpes simplex virus type 1 from multiple anatomic sites over time [^111WQvTK]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

**Methods**: The participant tested positive in a type-specific HSV immunoblot assay. Swab specimens were collected every weekday for 4 weeks using a spatial grid of the female genital tract, as previously described. An aliquot of each swab specimen underwent column-based DNA isolation and quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) analysis to detect HSV-1 genomes. The participant also experienced symptomatic genital HSV-1 recurrences before and after the swabbing study; specimens from associated lesions were collected for HSV-1 culture. This individual's virus is referred to as "v.29". The University of Washington Human Subjects Division approved the study, and the participant provided informed consent.

### Recommendations for the selective use of herpes simplex virus type 2 serological tests [^11595pSj]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) type-specific serological tests are now widely available, but indications for their use have not been well defined. The California Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STD) Controllers Association convened a committee of clinicians and researchers to make recommendations for the use of type-specific HSV type 2 (HSV-2) serological tests.

- **Methods**: By means of a systematic review of the literature, evidence to support screening in selected high-risk groups was compiled. Screening recommendations were developed by applying standard screening criteria to each specific population.

- **Results**: The committee concluded that, in addition to serological testing for the diagnostic evaluation of patients with symptoms, screening of asymptomatic patients is likely to be beneficial among the following groups: those at high risk for STDs and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection who are motivated to reduce their sexual risk behavior, HIV-infected patients, and patients with sex partners with genital herpes. In contrast, universal screening for HSV-2 infection in pregnant women is unlikely to be beneficial.

- **Conclusions**: The targeted use of HSV-2 serological tests for specific diagnostic situations and selected populations should benefit patients, providers, and the community. Until more data become available, these recommendations provide justification for selective diagnostic and screening uses of HSV-2 serological tests.

### Effect of HSV-2 infection on subsequent HIV acquisition: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis [^113tLF4D]. The Lancet Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

HIV and herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) are two global health problems. In 2015, an estimated 36.7 million people were living with HIV/AIDS globally. In 2012, approximately 417 million people aged 15–49 years had an HSV-2 infection. Seventy percent of HIV infections are in sub-Saharan Africa, which also has the highest HSV-2 prevalence. HSV-2 causes genital herpes, which, when symptomatic, is characterized by periodic recurrences of painful genital ulcers. Although genital herpes is asymptomatic or unrecognized in about 80–90% of individuals, asymptomatic viral reactivation and shedding are common. Thus, although individuals with HSV-2 are most infectious when they are symptomatic, most transmissions are thought to occur when the source partner is asymptomatic. Genital HSV-2 infection can considerably affect relationships through feelings of shame and stigma and concerns about the risk of transmission.

HIV and HSV-2 are both lifelong sexually transmitted infections (STIs) that are associated with similar risk factors (e.g. age, sex, partner change rate, condom use, male circumcision). Additionally, evidence exists of direct and reciprocal biological interactions between HIV and HSV-2. Active HSV-2 infection, regardless of symptoms, involves high concentrations of activated CD4-positive T cells, which are target cells for HIV, in the genital area and can lead to breaks in the mucosal layer through which HIV can enter. Because genital ulceration and viral shedding occur most frequently in the first year of HSV-2 infection, the increase in HIV susceptibility might be highest initially.

### Optimizing PCR positivity criterion for detection of herpes simplex virus DNA on skin and mucosa [^112XJPjA]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2007). Low credibility.

In 1997, we developed a PCR assay for the detection of herpes simplex virus (HSV) DNA. Recently, we determined an optimal positivity criterion based on research specimens and a dilution study. We found that a cutoff of 50 HSV DNA copies/ml of swab specimen, a level 10-fold lower than our previous cutoff, minimizes misclassification.

### Viral shedding 1 year following first-episode genital HSV-1 infection [^114ZoUfW]. JAMA (2022). High credibility.

- **Importance**: Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) is the leading cause of first-episode genital herpes in many countries.

- **Objective**: To inform counseling messages regarding genital HSV-1 transmission, oral and genital viral shedding patterns among persons with first-episode genital HSV-1 infection were assessed. The trajectory of the development of HSV-specific antibody and T-cell responses was also characterized.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: This was a prospective cohort study followed up for up to 2 years, with 82 participants observed between 2013 and 2018. Participants were recruited from sexual health and primary care clinics in Seattle, Washington. Persons with laboratory-documented first-episode genital HSV-1 infection, without HIV infection or pregnancy, were referred for enrollment.

- **Exposures**: First-episode genital HSV-1 infection.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Genital and oral HSV-1 shedding and lesion rates were measured at 2 months, 11 months, and up to 2 years after initial genital HSV-1 infection. Participants self-collected oral and genital swabs for HSV polymerase chain reaction testing for 30 days at 2 and 11 months and up to 2 years after diagnosis of genital HSV-1. Blood samples were collected at serial time points to assess immune responses to HSV-1. Primary HSV-1 infection was defined as absent HSV antibody at baseline or evolving antibody profile using the University of Washington HSV Western Blot. HSV-specific T-cell responses were detected using interferon γ enzyme-linked immunospot.

- **Results**: Among the 82 participants, the median (range) age was 26 (16–64) years.

### Managing patients with genital herpes and their sexual partners [^115B7f2x]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

There is increasing recognition of the growing size and significance of the genital herpes epidemic. Recent developments in the wide-scale availability of type-specific herpes simplex virus (HSV) serologic assays have meant that many previously undiagnosed mild, atypical, and subclinical infections may now be diagnosed with some degree of confidence without the use of Western blots. The value of such diagnostics is controversial. However, the importance of HSV, with its facilitation of HIV transmission and acquisition, the availability of various preventative strategies for limiting vertical HSV transmission, and the growing evidence that condoms, some educational and counseling interventions, and antiviral therapies may limit sexual transmission, have challenged many of the arguments against wider testing of the population.

### Persistent genital herpes simplex virus-2 shedding years following the first clinical episode [^1169jm4R]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Patients with newly acquired genital herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2) infection frequently have the virus detected at the genital mucosa. Rates of genital shedding initially decrease over time after infection, but data on long-term viral shedding are lacking.

- **Methods**: For this study, 377 healthy adults with a history of symptomatic genital HSV-2 infection collected anogenital swabs for HSV-2 DNA polymerase chain reaction for at least 30 consecutive days.

- **Results**: The time since the first genital herpes episode was significantly associated with reduced genital shedding. Total HSV shedding occurred on 33.6% of days in participants less than 1 year, 20.6% in those 1–9 years, and 16.7% in those 10 years or more since the first episode. Subclinical HSV shedding occurred on 26.2% of days among participants less than 1 year, 13.1% in those 1–9 years, and 9.3% in those 10 years or more since the first episode. On days with HSV detection, the mean quantity was 4.9 log₁₀ copies/mL for those less than 1 year, 4.7 log₁₀ copies/mL among those 1–9 years, and 4.6 log₁₀ copies/mL among those 10 years or more since the first episode.

- **Conclusions**: Rates of total and subclinical HSV-2 shedding decrease after the first year following the initial clinical episode. However, viral shedding persists at high rates and copy numbers years after infection, which may pose a continued risk of HSV-2 transmission to sexual partners.

### Poor correlation between genital lesions and detection of herpes simplex virus in women in labor [^115Yqq2p]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2005). Low credibility.

To estimate the accuracy of clinical diagnosis of genital herpes for herpes simplex virus (HSV) detection among women in labor, viral detection by culture and HSV DNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) among women who underwent cesarean delivery for genital herpes was compared with women without HSV symptoms in labor who had genital swabs collected for HSV culture. This comparison extended to a subset of these women who had genital specimens available for PCR analysis, regardless of culture results.

From 1989 to 1999, 126 of 19,568 (0.6%) women underwent cesarean delivery for HSV. Of these, 26% of 110 women had HSV detected by culture from at least one genital specimen, and 46% of 70 women had HSV detected by PCR. During the same period, 61 of 12,623 (0.5%) asymptomatic women had HSV detected by culture. Between 1995 and 1996, 57 of 2,109 (2.7%) asymptomatic women had HSV detected by PCR. Thus, the presence of genital lesions had a sensitivity for HSV detection of 37% by culture and 41% by PCR. The amount of HSV present in asymptomatic women with HSV detected in genital secretions by PCR was often as high as those with genital lesions, although the median amount of HSV DNA detected was greater in women with lesions.

The conclusion drawn from this study is that clinical diagnosis of genital herpes at the time of labor correlates relatively poorly with HSV detection from genital sites or lesions by culture or PCR and fails to identify asymptomatic women who have HSV in their genital secretions at the time of labor.

### Seroprevalence of herpes simplex virus type 2 among persons aged 14–49 years — United States, 2005–2008 [^111vmqAe]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2010). Low credibility.

Herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) is one of the most common sexually transmitted infections worldwide and is the primary cause of genital and neonatal herpes, as well as genital ulcer disease. Multiple studies have shown that HSV-2 infection increases the risk for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection by at least twofold. HSV-2 infection is lifelong, and serologic testing provides the best method to estimate HSV-2 prevalence.

Since 1976, the CDC has monitored HSV-2 seroprevalence in the United States through the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). After increasing from 1976–1980 (NHANES II) to 1988–1994 (NHANES III), HSV-2 seroprevalence decreased from 21.0% in 1988–1994 to 17.0% in NHANES 1999–2004. To determine whether HSV-2 seroprevalence in the United States has changed since 1999–2004, and to estimate HSV-2 seroprevalence by age, race/ethnicity, and reported lifetime number of sex partners, the CDC analyzed serologic test results from persons aged 14–49 years who participated in NHANES 2005–2008.

The results indicated that HSV-2 seroprevalence was 16.2% overall, which was not statistically different from the seroprevalence in 1999–2004. Seroprevalence was highest among women (20.9%) and non-Hispanic blacks (39.2%). Of those infected with HSV-2, 81.1% had not received a diagnosis. Clinicians, health departments, health-care organizations, and community groups should promote measures that prevent HSV-2 transmission, including minimizing the number of sex partners, avoiding certain types of sexual partnerships, and using condoms consistently and correctly.

### Diagnosis and management of genital herpes: Key questions and review of the evidence for the 2021 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines [^115NZFPM]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). High credibility.

Genital herpes, caused by herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 1 or type 2, is a prevalent sexually transmitted infection (STI). Given that HSV is an incurable infection, there are important concerns about the appropriate use of diagnostic tools, management of the infection, prevention of transmission to sexual partners, and appropriate counseling. In preparation for updating the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) STI treatment guidelines, key questions for the management of genital herpes infection were developed with a panel of experts. To answer these questions, a systematic literature review was performed, with tables of evidence including articles that would change guidance assembled. These data were used to inform recommendations in the 2021 CDC STI treatment guidelines.

### Performance characteristics of highly automated HSV-1 and HSV-2 IgG testing [^112fMEv8]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2024). Low credibility.

Herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2 (HSV-1 and HSV-2) are important human pathogens that cause lifelong infections characterized by latent infection with cycles of viral mucosal replication. Classically, HSV infections present with episodes of recurrent, painful lesions of the oral or genital epithelium, but many infected persons remain asymptomatic. HSV is characterized by two types: HSV-1 is near-ubiquitous and infects an estimated 67% of the world's population and approximately 48% of adults in the United States of America. HSV-1 is associated with oral lesions but is an increasingly recognized cause of genital herpes. Conversely, HSV-2 is classically associated with genital herpes and infects approximately 13% of adults worldwide and about 12% of adults in the United States of America.

HSV infections can be diagnosed by detecting the virus itself — typically through culture or PCR — or by detecting antibodies against viral proteins. The HSV lifecycle, which includes cycles of lytic and latent infection, complicates diagnosis and limits accurate PCR testing to episodes of active mucosal infection. Not all episodes of active mucosal infection are symptomatic, and high rates of asymptomatic shedding mean symptoms alone cannot be used to guide testing to prevent transmission. High-throughput, sensitive, and specific serological diagnostics are required for both clinical care and for potential screening to diagnose the vast majority of HSV infections that currently go undetected.

### Genital herpes: Insights into sexually transmitted infectious disease [^111dH5pm]. Microbial Cell (2016). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on genital herpes:

- **Definition**: Genital herpes is a sexually transmitted viral infection characterized by primary and recurrent genital inflammation and lesions.

- **Pathophysiology**: The condition is mostly caused by HSV-2 and HSV-1, which are transmitted through sexual contact.

- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of genital herpes in North America is estimated to range from 5,000 to 24,000 per 100,000 people per year.

- **Disease course**: Clinical manifestations include lesions of the mucous membrane presenting as bilateral clusters of macules, papules, followed by vesicles, pustules, and ulcers on the external genitalia. Symptoms may include pain, itching, burning, dysuria, lymphadenopathy, fever, cervicitis (in women), and proctitis (in homosexual men). Complications in women can include aseptic meningitis and urinary retention. Recurrent episodes may show prodromal symptoms of paresthesia and pain in the area of lumbosacral dermatomes. Asymptomatic genital shedding without any clinical symptoms is quite frequent. The disease increases psychological stress with frequent recurrences.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Untreated pregnancy-related genital herpes is associated with a mortality of 0.062 per 1,000 births in neonates.

### Herpes simplex virus DNA testing by a loop-mediated isothermal amplification method for accurate clinical diagnosis and detection of mucosal viral shedding [^1137Wmp5]. The Journal of Dermatology (2022). Low credibility.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) periodically forms characteristic blisters in the perioral and genital areas in a subset of people. Because of the lack of accurate tests for this common virus, various types of perioral/anogenital lesions are often misdiagnosed as herpes. Additionally, though asymptomatic HSV-positive people shed the virus, the precise time course of symptoms and viral shedding is unclear.

The loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) method amplifies target DNA sequences without thermal cycles and is simpler and faster than the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). To investigate the clinico-laboratorial correlation and whether HSV can be detected in the oral cavity during symptom occurrence, we collected 445 specimens from 211 patients who visited our clinic with suspected herpetic lesions or were non-symptomatic volunteers. DNA was extracted from swabs simultaneously taken from lesions (n = 219) and seemingly asymptomatic oral mucosa (n = 226). HSV-1 and HSV-2 DNA sequences were amplified by LAMP and validated by quantitative real-time PCR.

The LAMP method detected HSV DNA almost as sensitively (97%) as PCR. Positivity for HSV DNA was found in 54% (40/74) of specimens from the perioral/oral area. A review of clinical images of reHerpes labialis revealed that HSV DNA was detected only from lesions located on the perioral skin and/or the dry, vermillion part of the lip. No HSV DNA was found in immunocompetent patients with lesions confined to the oral mucosa, except in cases of primary infection. This observation may be an important principle for the clinical diagnosis of reHerpes.

### The global and regional burden of genital ulcer disease due to herpes simplex virus: A natural history modelling study [^1179eUbN]. BMJ Global Health (2020). Low credibility.

Second, the GUD estimates build on published WHO estimates of HSV-1 and HSV-2 infection, meaning the issues and assumptions affecting the infection estimates, including data availability, generalizability, and quality, are carried forward to the GUD estimates. Furthermore, HSV-1 infection estimates were not produced separately by sex for all regions, meaning GUD estimates for HSV-1 may not fully capture differences by sex. However, the infection estimates were informed by systematic reviews up to August 2018 and represent the best attempt to quantify HSV-2 and genital HSV-1 prevalence and incidence globally by age and sex.

In some countries, such as the United States, an 'epidemiological transition' has already occurred whereby rates of oral HSV-1 infection during childhood have declined, and rates of genital HSV-1 infection have increased, due to decreased immunity to HSV-1 on entering adulthood possibly combined with increasing rates of oral sex. In the most recent prospective evaluation of GUD among women with new HSV infection in North America, 62% of HSV GUD first episodes were caused by HSV-1. Our estimate for the Americas was similar, with 55% of first episodes due to HSV-1. Such trends may be occurring elsewhere in the world.

Although the potential for genital HSV-1 infection post-childhood is uncertain, our analyses suggest that genital HSV-1 only makes a small contribution to all GUD globally, given the vastly greater number of HSV-2 recurrences. Similarly, a third limitation concerns the availability, quality, and representativeness of natural history data. Studies differed on the…

### Advances in diagnostics of sexually transmitted infections [^114zB7Pg]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2023). Low credibility.

Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are caused by various pathogens, many of which have common symptoms. Diagnostic tests are critical to supporting clinical evaluations in making patient management decisions. Molecular diagnostics are the preferred test type when available, especially in asymptomatic patients for many STIs. However, for some infections, serology offers the best insight into infectious status. Clinicians should be aware of the performance characteristics of the available STI diagnostic tests and understand how to use them. Point-of-care tests are helpful to implement rapid and accurate treatment responses, which are particularly helpful in certain at-risk populations.

### Herpes simplex virus type 2 and heterosexual spread of human immunodeficiency virus infection in developing countries: Hypotheses and research priorities [^1163U7Rd]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2003). Low credibility.

Herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) infection is almost always sexually transmitted and causes genital ulceration. Significant progress in our understanding of HSV infection has occurred over the last decade, partly due to the development of accurate and sensitive laboratory tests to study HSV-2. The application of PCR and type-specific serology to individual cases and in population-based studies has enabled the identification of a potentially important role for HSV-2 infection as a cofactor in the sexual transmission of HIV. This issue is particularly pressing in developing countries. This review describes the epidemiology of HSV-2 infection in the HIV era, the hypotheses regarding HSV-HIV interactions, and research priorities for the developing world.

### Genome-wide surveillance of genital herpes simplex virus type 1 from multiple anatomic sites over time [^116KHvDv]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

We studied an individual who acquired HSV-1 five years prior, and, therefore, any viral adaptation to the genital niche or her immune response may have already occurred. Although it is plausible that daily swabbing of the genital mucosa could affect the observed genital shedding patterns, the participant's prior five years of repeated recurrences suggest otherwise. We also cannot rule out that the viral genomes and shedding patterns observed here could represent spatial cross-contamination, rather than simultaneous reactivation of the virus from multiple ganglia. However, in previous work exploring anatomic shedding patterns of HSV-2, several controls were used to address this possibility, and it was concluded that simultaneous reactivation, rather than contamination, accounted for the observed HSV-2 shedding patterns. In this study, we found minor genetic variants between swab specimens collected on the same day at different genital sites, providing further support for simultaneous shedding, rather than cross-contamination.

One of the strengths of this study was the implementation of an oligonucleotide enrichment strategy that enabled successful sequencing and assembly of the first uncultured genital HSV-1 genomes. We observed that the differences in HSV-1 genome copy number and the ratio of viral to host DNA impacted the overall yield and viral genome recovery of each library. The coverage of all v.29 genomes met or exceeded that of prior genomic studies of cultured HSV-1. However, the high G+C-content, repetitive elements, and potential recombination breakpoints in the large strain posed challenges.

### Interventions for men and women with their first episode of genital herpes [^112AYUJo]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Genital herpes is incurable and caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV). First-episode genital herpes is the initial clinical presentation of herpes that a person experiences. Treatment focuses on viral suppression to decrease the length and severity of the episode.

- **Objectives**: To determine the effectiveness and safety of different existing treatments for first-episode genital herpes on the duration of symptoms and time to recurrence.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) from inception to April 2016; MEDLINE from inception to April 2016; the Specialized Register of the Cochrane Sexually Transmitted Infections Review Group from inception to April 2016; EMBASE from inception to April 2016; PsycINFO from inception to April 2016; CINAHL from inception to April 2016; LILACS from inception to April 2016; AMED from inception to April 2016; and the Alternative Medicines Specialized Register from inception to April 2016. We hand-searched a number of relevant journals, searched reference lists of all included studies, databases of ongoing trials, and other Internet databases.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on participants with first-episode genital herpes. We excluded vaccination trials and trials in which the primary objective assessed a complication of HSV infection.

- **Data collection and analysis**: All studies written in English were independently assessed by at least two review authors for inclusion and risk of bias for each trial.

### Multicenter evaluation of Meridian Bioscience HSV 1&2 molecular assay for detection of herpes simplex virus 1 and 2 from clinical cutaneous and mucocutaneous specimens [^112YJe7Q]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2016). Low credibility.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) causes acute and relapsing symptoms characterized by ulcerative lesions. Laboratory diagnosis of HSV in cutaneous or mucocutaneous lesions has historically been performed using viral cell culture systems; however, these tests are laborious and suffer decreased sensitivity for advanced-stage lesions. The recent availability of FDA-cleared, moderately complex assays has resulted in increased use of molecular diagnostics for the routine detection of HSV in superficial swab specimens.

We performed a clinical evaluation of the recently FDA-cleared illumigene HSV 1&2 loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay (Meridian Bioscience, Cincinnati, OH) for the detection and differentiation of HSV-1 and HSV-2 in cutaneous and mucocutaneous swab specimens. A total of 1,153 clinical swab specimens were collected and tested at seven different clinical centers. Each specimen was tested for the presence of HSV-1 and HSV-2 using the illumigene assay, and results were compared to those of the enzyme-linked virus-inducible system (ELVIS) as the reference method.

Overall, the illumigene assay demonstrated a sensitivity and specificity of 94.8% and 95.5%, respectively, for the detection of HSV-1. Detection of HSV-2 was similar, with a sensitivity of 98.9% and a specificity of 95.5%. Discrepant analysis was performed using an alternative molecular test (AmpliVue HSV1+2 assay; Quidel Molecular, San Diego, CA) on 91 out of 99 specimens that were recorded as false positive (FP) or false negative (FN) compared to the reference method. In total, 57 out of 78 (73%) FP and 9…

### Inaccuracy of certain commercial enzyme immunoassays in diagnosing genital infections with herpes simplex virus types 1 or 2 [^1121gRzg]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2003). Low credibility.

Type-specific serologic results may be inaccurate if not based on glycoprotein G (gG). Commercial tests based on crude antigen, provided by Zeus Scientific (Raritan, NJ), Wampole Laboratories (Cranbury, NJ), and DiaSorin (Stillwater, MN), and one using gG-1 and gG-2 from Focus Technologies (Cypress, CA) were compared with Western blot on serum samples. These samples were from patients with culture-documented first symptomatic episodes of genital herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 1 (n = 17) or HSV-2 (n = 49) infection, or re-genital episodes (HSV-1, 30; HSV-2, 49).

- **Concordance with Western blot results**:
	- Zeus: 56%
	- Wampole: 63%
	- DiaSorin: 52% to 54%
	- Focus: 83%

- **Sensitivity and specificity for HSV-1**:
	- Zeus: 77% sensitivity, 53% specificity
	- Wampole: 91% sensitivity, 35% specificity
	- DiaSorin: 98% sensitivity, 8% specificity
	- DiaSorin predominant antibody: 94% sensitivity, 70% specificity
	- Focus: 83% sensitivity, 90% specificity

- **Sensitivity and specificity for HSV-2**:
	- Zeus: 88% sensitivity, 81% specificity
	- Wampole: 92% sensitivity, 83% specificity
	- DiaSorin: 96% sensitivity, 54% specificity
	- DiaSorin predominant antibody: 38% sensitivity, 98% specificity
	- Focus: 98% sensitivity, 96% specificity

Type-specific serologic testing for HSV should be performed with gG-based tests for accurate diagnosis of symptomatic genital herpes.

### Twenty years of herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) research in low-income and middle-income countries: Systematic evaluation of progress made in addressing WHO priorities for research in HSV-2 epidemiology and diagnostics [^117KWgu2]. BMJ Global Health (2024). Low credibility.

A total of 63 studies assessing HSV-2 diagnostics in LMICs between 2000 and 2020 were identified. The most frequently researched topic was serological diagnostic techniques with 33 (52.3%) studies. Other, less frequently studied techniques were molecular biology/DNA detection methods 16 (25.3%), syndromic diagnosis 12 (19.0%), and diagnostic sampling techniques 6 (9.5%).

In terms of study participants, 36 (57.1%) studies included both male and female participants. Studies involving only females totaled 16 (25.3%), while those including only males numbered 5 (7.9%).

- **Geographical distribution**: The most studied areas were East Asia with 14 (22.2%) and East Africa with 12 (19.0%). South Asia and Southern Africa had 11 (17.4%) and 8 (12.6%) studies, respectively. Both West Africa and South America had 7 studies (11.1%) each. Central Africa and Western Asia accounted for five (7.9%) and three (4.7%) studies, respectively, while both Central America and North Africa had one (1.5%) each.

- **Study population focus**: Most studies, 26 (41.2%), focused on clinic attendees and/or symptomatic people presumed to have GUD. Other populations studied included the general population 12 (19.0%), commercial sex workers 5 (7.9%), MSM 5 (7.9%), pregnant women 4 (6.3%), patients living with HIV 4 (6.3%), people with infertility 3 (4.7%), adolescents 1 (1.5%), market vendors 1 (1.5%), and fishermen 1 (1.5%).

### Serologic detection of herpes simplex virus type 2 antibodies among pregnant women using a point-of-care test from Focus Diagnostics [^112e4x5A]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2009). Low credibility.

Serologic assays that identify herpes simplex type 2 (HSV-2) type-specific antibodies have been commercially available for more than a decade. Greater acceptance of these tests is hindered by uncertainty regarding their performance in real-world clinical settings.

- **Objectives**: The primary objective was to compare the test characteristics of the Focus HerpeSelect Express Assay (EA) versus the Focus HerpeSelect enzyme linked immunoassay (ELISA) for detection of HSV-2 type-specific antibodies among pregnant women enrolled from three geographic sites with varying prevalences of HSV-2 infection. A second objective was to evaluate the performance of an HSV-2 testing strategy in which EA screens and ELISA confirms HSV-2 serodiagnosis.

- **Study design**: We enrolled 399 pregnant women from Atlanta, GA, Moorestown, NJ, and Pittsburgh, PA into this cross-sectional investigation. Capillary whole blood was obtained from study participants and evaluated for the presence of type-specific HSV-2 antibodies using the EA. Serum samples were also obtained from all study participants for subsequent identification of HSV-2 type-specific antibodies using both ELISA and the Focus Immunoblot assays.

- **Results**: We observed 96.2% agreement between results obtained with EA and ELISA. Overall, when compared to ELISA results, the sensitivity of EA for detection of HSV-2 type-specific antibodies was 94.2% and the specificity was 97.1%. Using Immunoblot results as our standard for performance calculations, the positive predictive value (PPV) of HSV-2 serodiagnosis increased from 91.7% to 98.2% when ELISA was used for confirmation.

### Current thinking on genital herpes [^1172tkQw]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Genital herpes has a high global prevalence and burden of disease. This manuscript highlights recent advances in our understanding of genital herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections.

- **Recent findings**: Studies demonstrate a changing epidemiological landscape with an increasing proportion of genital herpes cases associated with HSV type 1. There is also growing evidence that the majority of infected individuals exhibit frequent, brief shedding episodes that are most often asymptomatic, which likely contribute to high HSV transmission rates. Given this finding, as well as readily available serological assays, some have proposed that routine HSV screening be performed; however, this remains controversial and is not currently recommended. Host immune responses, particularly local CD4 and CD8 T cell activity, are crucial for HSV control and clearance following initial infection, during latency, and after reactivation. Prior HSV immunity may also afford partial protection against HSV reinfection and disease. Although HSV vaccine trials have been disappointing at the time of writing and existing antiviral medications are limited, novel prophylactic and therapeutic modalities are currently in development.

- **Summary**: Although much remains unknown about genital herpes, improved knowledge of HSV epidemiology, pathogenesis, and host immunity may help guide new strategies for disease prevention and control.

### Genital herpes complicating pregnancy [^112m6zVK]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2005). Low credibility.

Approximately 22% of pregnant women are infected with herpes simplex virus (HSV)-2, and 2% of women will acquire HSV during pregnancy. Remarkably, up to 90% of these women are undiagnosed because they are asymptomatic or have subtle symptoms attributed to other vulvovaginal disorders. Diagnosis of genital herpes relies on laboratory confirmation with culture or polymerase chain reaction assay of genital lesions and type-specific glycoprotein G-based serologic testing. Neonatal herpes is the most severe complication of genital HSV infection and is caused by contact with infected genital secretions at the time of labor. Maternal acquisition of HSV in the third trimester of pregnancy carries the highest risk of neonatal transmission.

Despite advances in the diagnosis and treatment of neonatal herpes, little change in the incidence or serious sequelae from this infection has occurred. As such, prevention of the initial neonatal infection is critically important. Obstetricians are in a unique position to prevent vertical HSV transmission by identifying women with genital lesions at the time of labor for cesarean delivery, prescribing antiviral suppressive therapy as appropriate, and avoiding unnecessary invasive intrapartum procedures in women with genital herpes. Enhanced prevention strategies include identification of women at risk for HSV acquisition during pregnancy by testing women and possibly their partners for HSV antibodies and providing counseling to prevent transmission to women in late pregnancy.

### Genital ulcers: Differential diagnosis and management [^111dQMhd]. American Family Physician (2020). Low credibility.

Genital ulcers can occur on the vagina, penis, and anorectal or perineal areas and may be infectious or noninfectious. Herpes simplex virus is the most common cause of genital ulcers in the United States. A diagnosis of genital herpes simplex virus infection is made through physical examination and observation of genital lesions. The 2015 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention sexually transmitted disease guidelines provide strategies for the management of patients with genital ulcer disease. Specific testing includes a polymerase chain reaction test for herpes simplex virus, syphilis serology and darkfield microscopy, or a direct fluorescent antibody test for Treponema pallidum, and/or culture for Haemophilus ducreyi in settings where chancroid is highly prevalent. Rarely, cases of Epstein-Barr virus may present with genital ulcers. Syphilis and chancroid cause genital ulcers and are mandatory reportable diseases to the local health department. In some cases, no pathogen is identified. It is important to consider noninfectious etiologies such as sexual trauma, psoriasis, Behçet syndrome, and fixed drug eruptions. Genital ulcers are symptomatic by definition, and the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends screening for syphilis infection for those at risk, early screening for syphilis infection in all pregnant women, and against routine serologic screening for genital herpes simplex virus infection in asymptomatic adolescents and adults, including those who are pregnant.

### Genital herpes [^112xfA2W]. Lancet (2007). Low credibility.

Genital herpes is the main cause of genital ulcers worldwide; the prevalence of herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 2 infections in the general population ranges from 10% to 60%. Most genital herpes cases are caused by HSV-2, although HSV-1 accounts for about half of new cases in developed countries. The risk of HIV acquisition is three times higher in people with HSV-2. Neonatal herpes is an uncommon but serious complication of genital herpes.

Most genital HSV-2 infections are unrecognized and undiagnosed. Infected individuals, even with mild symptoms, shed HSV and can infect sexual partners. Since clinical diagnosis is neither sensitive nor specific, virological and type-specific serological tests should be used routinely. Oral antiviral drugs for HSV infections are safe and effective; they can be used both to treat episodes and to prevent recurrences. Antiviral treatment of the infected partners and condom use reduce the risk of sexual transmission of HSV-2.

### Twenty years of herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) research in low-income and middle-income countries: Systematic evaluation of progress made in addressing WHO priorities for research in HSV-2 epidemiology and diagnostics [^116i9M77]. BMJ Global Health (2024). High credibility.

In 2001, in response to the substantial burden of HSV-2 and a growing body of evidence linking HSV-2 to HIV prevalence and incidence, the WHO hosted a three-day workshop to set research priorities for HSV-2 in LMICs. Setting health research priorities is essential for optimized use of research resources, particularly in resource-poor countries. Priorities are best developed through the application of defined methodologies by multiple stakeholders, including researchers, policymakers, healthcare providers, and service users. The workshop brought together a broad range of regional and disciplinary expertise.

The participants were from Europe (n = 18), Africa (n = 10), North America (n = 7), and Asia (n = 1). Their expertise spanned areas of biochemistry, clinical medicine, program interventions, and mathematical disease modeling, and most of them represented well-established global health research organizations and educational institutions. Most of the organizations present originated from high-income countries, such as the United States (six institutes) and the UK (14 organizations and educational institutions). Eight institutions were based in LMICs: Zimbabwe (n = 3), Uganda (n = 3), South Africa (n = 1), and India (n = 1) (further described in companion paper).

The workshop included expert presentations, plenary dialogues, and breakout discussion groups. On the final day, a list of recommendations made during the discussions was examined and prioritized in five key areas: HSV-2 epidemiology, HSV-2 diagnostics, HSV-2/HIV interactions, HSV-2 control measures, and HSV-2 mathematical modeling.

### Twenty years of herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) research in low-income and middle-income countries: Systematic evaluation of progress made in addressing WHO priorities for research in HSV-2 epidemiology and diagnostics [^111deMyX]. BMJ Global Health (2024). High credibility.

Higher HSV-2 prevalence was found in women compared with men. This gender discrepancy appears constant over different geographical areas and could be due to a higher biological susceptibility to HSV-2 infection in women than men. As expected for a virus that causes lifelong infection, most studies found that HSV-2 prevalence is strongly associated with age.

The review's findings also draw attention to the limited research exploring the reasons for the high HSV-2 prevalence in young adults (mean age = 25 years), particularly women from sub-Saharan Africa. It also highlights the limited research examining the contribution of HSV-2 to genital ulcer disease (GUD). Given that HSV-2 infection can lead to recurring GUD, more studies are required.

We found no HSV-2 studies based in the Middle East, North Africa, and Eastern Europe during the studied period. However, because we excluded non-English language records and could not use separate search terms for each developing country, we likely missed several relevant studies specific to those regions.

All the research priorities for HSV-2 diagnostics were addressed, at least in part. Substantial progress was made in DNA detection methods and exploring the performance of existing serological assays in different African sera. More accurate and rapid DNA detection techniques continue to be researched, and many African countries have ascertained the most accurate ELISA for their populations. However, establishing the optimal genital sampling technique was a research priority that was only partially addressed.

### Diagnosis and management of genital ulcers [^116krnmh]. American Family Physician (2012). Low credibility.

Herpes simplex virus infection and syphilis are the most common causes of genital ulcers in the United States. Other infectious causes include chancroid, lymphogranuloma venereum, granuloma inguinale (donovanosis), secondary bacterial infections, and fungi. Noninfectious etiologies, including sexual trauma, psoriasis, Behçet syndrome, and fixed drug eruptions, can also lead to genital ulcers.

Although initial treatment of genital ulcers is generally based on clinical presentation, the following tests should be considered in all patients: serologic tests for syphilis and darkfield microscopy or direct fluorescent antibody testing for Treponema pallidum, culture or polymerase chain reaction test for herpes simplex virus, and culture for Haemophilus ducreyi in settings with a high prevalence of chancroid. No pathogen is identified in up to 25 percent of patients with genital ulcers.

The first episode of herpes simplex virus infection is usually treated with seven to 10 days of oral acyclovir (five days for recurrences). Famciclovir and valacyclovir are alternative therapies. One dose of intramuscular penicillin G benzathine is recommended to treat genital ulcers caused by primary syphilis. Treatment options for chancroid include a single dose of intramuscular ceftriaxone or oral azithromycin, ciprofloxacin, or erythromycin. Lymphogranuloma venereum and donovanosis are treated with 21 days of oral doxycycline. Treatment of noninfectious causes of genital ulcers varies by etiology and ranges from topical wound care for ulcers caused by sexual trauma to consideration of specific therapies.

### Genital herpes infection: Progress and problems [^114mNPeo]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2023). Low credibility.

Genital herpes (GH) is a sexually transmitted infection causing recurrent, self-limited genital, buttock, and thigh ulcerations. Symptoms range from unrecognized or mild to severe, with frequent recurrences. Herpes simplex viruses (HSV), type-1 or type-2, cause GH. HSV establishes latency in the sacral ganglia and causes lifelong infection. Viral reactivation leads to genital ulceration or asymptomatic shedding, which may lead to transmission. HSV infection during pregnancy can cause fulminant hepatitis and neonatal transmission. Severe and atypical manifestations are seen in immunocompromised people. Guanosine analogs treat symptoms and prevent recurrences, shedding, and transmission. Novel preventive and therapeutic strategies are in development.

Genital herpes is an infection with herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) or type 2 (HSV-2) and is among the most common sexually transmitted diseases.

- **Methods and outcomes**: We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of interventions to prevent sexual transmission of herpes simplex virus? What are the effects of interventions to prevent transmission of herpes simplex virus from mother to neonate? What are the effects of antiviral treatment in people with a first episode of genital herpes? What are the effects of interventions to reduce the impact of recurrence? What are the effects of treatments in people with genital herpes and HIV? We searched Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to January 2010 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organizations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

- **Results**: We found 35 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

- **Conclusions**: In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: antivirals, caesarean delivery, condoms, oral aciclovir, psychotherapy, recombinant glycoprotein vaccines, serological screening, and counselling.

### Evaluation of a new point-of-care serologic assay for herpes simplex virus type 2 infection [^112YWxre]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Herpes simplex virus type 2 infection is one of the most common sexually transmitted diseases. Because presentation is often atypical or subclinical, serologic testing is necessary for diagnosis, treatment, and counseling. In an urban clinic that specializes in the treatment of sexually transmitted diseases, a new point-of-care rapid serologic test was compared with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay or Western blot for the detection of herpes simplex virus type 2.

With the use of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay index cutoff value of 1.1, the rapid test was found to have a sensitivity of 97%, a specificity of 98%, a positive predictive value of 92%, and a negative predictive value of 99%. Increasing the cutoff index value to 3.5 increased the test sensitivity to 100%.

### The global and regional burden of genital ulcer disease due to herpes simplex virus: A natural history modelling study [^1112fYDF]. BMJ Global Health (2020). Low credibility.

Sensitivity analysis identified three areas of uncertainty which might particularly influence the GUD estimates:

- **Uncertainty around HSV-2 recurrences**: The duration for which people continue to experience HSV-2 recurrences remains uncertain. This is because recurrence rates for the past 10 years were informed by only two studies.

- **Uncertainty regarding clinic-based versus unrecognized infection rates**: The percentage of the HSV-2 infected population to which recurrence rates apply may differ between clinic-based studies and studies of unrecognized infections. Clinic rates might be biased towards those with more severe disease. In contrast, studies focusing on unrecognized infection may exclude those already diagnosed with HSV-related GUD, varying by setting.

- **Uncertainty about true HSV-related symptoms**: Determining the percentage of the HSV-2 infected population that has actual HSV-related symptoms is challenging. Even in prospective studies of seroconversion that assess symptoms, identification of GUD heavily depends on how thoroughly and frequently participants are counseled, followed up, and assessed.

In a large-scale clinical trial involving both women and men, which included a thorough search for and evaluation of possible HSV-related symptoms, 35.5% had documented first-episode GUD at any time around or after seroconversion.

A sensitivity analysis was conducted for the HSV-2 GUD burden estimates by: (1) limiting recurrences to the first 10 years since the acquisition of HSV-2 infection, and (2) applying natural history parameters from studies of people with unrecognized infection to the entire HSV-2 infected population.

### Acog practice bulletin: Clinical management guidelines for obstetrician-gynecologists, number 57, November 2004. Gynecologic herpes simplex virus infections [^111orxW5]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2004). Low credibility.

Both herpes simplex virus (HSV) type I and HSV type 2 can cause genital herpes. Because the infection is chronic, genital herpes has become the most common sexually transmitted disease among women. The prevalence of the HSV-2 antibody among women in the United States is 26%, although genital herpes has been diagnosed in only a small proportion (10–25%) of individuals with HSV-2 antibodies. Herpes simplex virus type I is becoming a more frequent cause of genital herpes, especially among young women. Overall, HSV-I seroprevalence in the United States is estimated at 67%, although serologic data do not provide information about the site of infection. Recent advances in diagnostic methods and therapeutic options are likely to change the management of genital herpes.

### Performance characteristics of highly automated HSV-1 and HSV-2 IgG testing [^112166oi]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2024). High credibility.

To further examine automated HSV serology assay performance, we took advantage of a unique cohort of 1,017 persons with genital HSV infection confirmed by PCR or culture through genital herpes studies at the UW VRC from 1981 to 2019. For this study, we included samples from persons with genital herpes with PCR- or culture-confirmed HSV infection who had serological testing using the WB at least 6 months (median 5.8 years, range 6 months to 50 years) after the initial episode of genital herpes. Given the focus on genital herpes, 886 (87%) people in this cohort had PCR- or culture-confirmed HSV-2 infections, and 131 (13%) people had PCR- or culture-confirmed genital HSV-1 infections. WB results were 100% concordant with the PCR or culture results. Of the 886 people with confirmed HSV-2 genital infections, 320 (36%) also had HSV-1 antibodies detected on the WB, most likely from prior HSV-1 infection.

The VRC cohort was composed of 669 women (65.8%) and 348 men (34.2%) who provided samples between 1981 and 2019 (median 1989). Most people were white (86.3%), and the overall median age was 34.3 years (range: 16–88 years).

### Genome-wide surveillance of genital herpes simplex virus type 1 from multiple anatomic sites over time [^116AGzoi]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

A small percentage of individuals with genital HSV-1 infection have a high rate of recurrence beyond the first year of infection. It is unknown whether HSV-1 in these individuals differs genetically from other HSV-1 isolates that are successfully controlled by the host immune system, or if the ongoing recurrences represent an innate failure of the immune system. Prior approaches studying HSV-1 genetic variation in clinical cases such as these have relied on PCR analysis of single genes or on viral samples that have been expanded in tissue culture.

Recent advancements in next-generation sequencing and targeted oligonucleotide enrichment now enable capture of whole viral genomes directly from mucosal surfaces, without expansion in culture. This approach has been applied to viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and human cytomegalovirus to reveal viral adaptation or evolution within a host and to deduce its potential impacts on pathogenesis and disease.

Here, we present the first genome sequences of uncultured mucosal swab specimens of HSV-1, which were collected from a study participant who has an unusually high recurrence rate of genital HSV-1. We used oligonucleotide enrichment to capture and sequence uncultured viral genomes directly from symptomatic lesions and nonlesion sites, and standard library preparation methods to sequence viral genomes from diagnostic lesion material expanded in culture. With these data, our goal was to establish the level of viral diversity present within a single host over a time period involving several rounds of latency and reactivation.

### Laboratory diagnosis of neonatal herpes simplex virus infections [^114NbMdv]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2019). Low credibility.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) is a common and often benign infection in humans; although it less commonly affects newborns, infection in this age group can be devastating. Newborns often present with nonspecific clinical findings, making timely and accurate diagnosis of infection critical. A wide variety of tests are available for detecting herpes simplex virus infection, but only a subset are useful and validated in the newborn population. The review summarizes available diagnostic testing for neonatal disease, including discussing limitations, unmet needs, and emerging data on molecular testing methods.

### Serologic screening for genital herpes: An updated evidence report and systematic review for the US Preventive Services Task Force [^115XWYYE]. JAMA (2016). Low credibility.

Genital herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection is a prevalent sexually transmitted infection. Vertical transmission of HSV can lead to fetal morbidity and mortality. This study aimed to assess the evidence on serologic screening and preventive interventions for genital HSV infection in asymptomatic adults and adolescents to support the US Preventive Services Task Force in updating their recommendation statement.

The data sources included MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library, EMBASE, and trial registries through March 31, 2016. Additional surveillance for new evidence in targeted publications was conducted through October 31, 2016.

English-language randomized clinical trials (RCTs) were selected based on their comparison of screening versus no screening in individuals without past or current symptoms of genital herpes. The study also evaluated the accuracy and potential harms of serologic screening tests for HSV-2, as well as RCTs assessing preventive interventions in asymptomatic individuals seropositive for HSV-2.

The data extraction and synthesis involved dual review of abstracts and full-text articles, along with assessments of study quality. Pooled sensitivities and specificities of screening tests were calculated using a hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic curve analysis when at least three similar studies were available.

The main outcomes and measures included the accuracy of screening tests, benefits of screening, harms of screening, and reduction in genital herpes outbreaks.

A total of 17 studies (n = 9736 participants; range, 24–3290) across 19 publications were included. Notably, no RCTs compared screening with no screening, and most studies on the accuracy of screening tests were conducted in populations with high HSV-2 prevalence.

### Type-specific identification of anogenital herpes simplex virus infections by use of a commercially available nucleic acid amplification test [^117K7Udo]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2012). Low credibility.

Herpes infections are among the most common sexually transmitted infections (STI), but diagnostic methods for genital herpes have not kept pace with the movement toward molecular testing. Here, we describe an FDA-approved molecular assay that identifies and types herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections for use in routine clinical settings. Paired samples from anogenital lesions were tested using the BD ProbeTec HSV Q(x) (HSVQ(x)) system, HSV culture, and a laboratory-developed PCR assay. Family planning, obstetrics/gynecology (OB/GYN), or sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinics in the United States served as recruitment sites.

Sensitivity and specificity estimates, head-to-head comparisons, measures of agreement, and latent-class analyses were performed to provide robust estimates of performance. A total of 508 participants (174 men and 334 women) with anogenital lesions were included; 260 HSV-2 and 73 HSV-1 infections were identified. No differences in test performance based on gender, clinic type, location of the lesion, or type of lesion were observed. The sensitivity of HSV-2 detection ranged from 98.4 to 100% depending on the analytical approach, while the specificity ranged from 80.6%, compared to the less sensitive culture method, to 97.0%, compared to PCR. For HSV-1, the sensitivity and specificity ranges were 96.7 to 100% and 95.1 to 99.4%, respectively. This assay may improve our ability to accurately diagnose anogenital lesions due to herpes infection.

### Future prospects for new vaccines against sexually transmitted infections [^117C1ALS]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Herpes simplex virus

HSV-2 is the most common cause of genital herpes, with an estimated 417 million people aged 14–49 infected worldwide. Additionally, 140 million adults are estimated to have a genital infection with HSV-1, which is often acquired orally in childhood but is now an important cause of genital herpes in many high-income countries (HICs). Genital HSV infection leads to chronic infection with a lifelong reservoir in the sacral ganglia. Viral reactivation occurs frequently, particularly for HSV-2, leading to genital ulcers or asymptomatic viral shedding at the genital skin or mucosa, during which HSV can be transmitted. A major negative public health consequence of HSV-2 infection is its role in propagating the HIV epidemic, as chronic genital inflammation from HSV-2 increases HIV acquisition risk by twofold to threefold. In Kenya, the estimated population attributable fraction of HIV infection due to HSV-2 is 48%. Mother-to-child HSV transmission causing neonatal herpes is rare but often leads to infant death or devastating neurologic damage. Prevention tools, including antivirals and condoms, can partially reduce HSV transmission risk for individuals, but no method provides adequate protection. An HSV vaccine is a much-needed prevention strategy.

Two strategies are being pursued for HSV-2 vaccine development. The classic approach uses a prophylactic vaccine targeting people who are not infected to prevent HSV acquisition. Alternatively, a therapeutic vaccine is designed for people who already have HSV-2 infection to reduce shedding and recurrence.

In recent proficiency testing of herpes simplex virus type-specific serologic evidence by the College of American Pathologists, commercially available herpes simplex virus antibody assays that were not glycoprotein-G based demonstrated high false-positive rates (14%-88%) for herpes simplex virus type-2 antibodies in sera that were positive for herpes simplex virus type-1 antibodies but negative for herpes simplex virus type-2 antibodies. Herpes simplex virus serologic testing should be performed with only glycoprotein-G-based tests.

### Rapid diagnosis of herpes simplex virus 1 and 2 bloodstream infections utilizing a sample-to-answer platform [^1117xU57]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2024). High credibility.

Various methods have been employed for the diagnosis of HSV-1 and HSV-2 infections, including conventional viral culture, serological tests, and nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT). Among these diagnostic methods, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is widely utilized due to its high sensitivity and specificity, as well as its short turnaround time for detecting viral nucleic acid. However, it is important to note that FDA-cleared assays for HSV-1 and HSV-2 detection are currently limited to two specimen types: cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and cutaneous or mucocutaneous lesion swabs.

The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that all infants born to mothers who test positive for genital HSV lesions undergo testing for HSV within 24–36 hours of birth. This includes PCR testing in whole blood and HSV cultures. Presently, no FDA-cleared molecular assays are specifically designed for HSV-1 and HSV-2 detection in blood as a specimen type. However, HSV NAAT laboratory-developed tests (LDTs) using blood are commonly used in clinical practice for the management of patients suspected of HSV-1 and HSV-2 infections. Previous studies have explored various sample types for HSV detection, including whole blood, dried blood spots, serum, plasma, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). However, there is a lack of standardization and consensus on the optimal specimen type for detecting bloodstream HSV infections. While whole blood is widely utilized, there is currently insufficient data to demonstrate its superiority over other blood compartments for diagnosis and managing HSV-1 and HSV.

### Serological testing for herpes simplex virus (HSV)-1 and HSV-2 infection [^116izgFD]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Serological tests for herpes simplex virus (HSV) that can accurately distinguish between HSV-1 and HSV-2 are now commercially available. These tests detect antibodies to HSV glycoproteins G-1 and G-2, which evoke a type-specific antibody response. Focus Technologies produces the HerpeSelect-1 and HerpeSelect-2 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay tests and the HSV-1 and HSV-2 HerpeSelect 1/2 Immunoblot. Diagnology has marketed the POCkit-HSV-2, a point-of-care test for HSV-2 that allows blood from a finger stick to be tested in a clinic. These tests can be used to confirm a genital herpes diagnosis, establish the diagnosis of HSV infection in patients with atypical complaints, identify asymptomatic carriers, and identify persons at risk for acquiring HSV. Potential settings for the use of these tests include sexually transmitted disease clinics, prenatal clinics, and clinics that care for patients with human immunodeficiency virus. Patient interest in HSV serological tests appears high.

### Genital herpes: Rapid evidence review [^115SCbDS]. American Family Physician (2024). Low credibility.

Genital herpes is a sexually transmitted infection caused by herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 1 or 2. It affects at least 500 million people worldwide and is a lifelong condition involving initial infection and periodic reactivation with variable viral shedding. There are no vaccinations for the prevention of HSV, and routine serologic screening is not recommended in asymptomatic individuals.

Practices that prevent or reduce transmission include the use of suppressive antiviral therapy in serodiscordant partners, avoiding sexual contact during outbreaks, and the use of condoms. A clinically apparent herpes outbreak is characterized by painful vesicles on the genitals, rectum, or perineum and may be accompanied by a flu-like syndrome of fever, malaise, and lymphadenopathy. Diagnosis uses type-specific polymerase chain reaction, viral culture of active lesions, or type-specific serologic testing.

Nucleoside analogue medications reduce viral shedding and are used to treat active outbreaks and prevent recurrences. Complications of genital herpes include encephalitis, meningitis, and urinary retention. During pregnancy, antiviral suppression is recommended starting at 36 weeks of gestation in patients with a known history of genital herpes. Elective cesarean delivery should be offered to patients with active lesions to reduce neonatal exposure to HSV.

### Targeted prenatal herpes simplex virus testing: Can we identify women at risk of transmission to the neonate [^113CZo4N]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2006). Low credibility.

Potential strategies to prevent neonatal herpes include herpes simplex virus (HSV) serologic testing, counseling of pregnant women, and rapid HSV polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing of maternal genital secretions at delivery. The cost-effectiveness of these interventions would be improved if high-risk pregnancies could be easily identified for targeted testing.

- **Study design**: Washington State birth certificate data for all singleton live births from 1987 through 2002 were linked with infant death and hospital discharge data for birth and subsequent hospitalizations. This was conducted in a population-based case-control study of risk factors for neonatal herpes. A case was defined as an infant with a discharge diagnosis of HSV infection (International Classification of Diseases 9th edition [ICD-9] code 054.X) from birth admission or readmission within 30 days of life. Five controls per case were frequency matched to cases by year of birth.

- **Results**: Ninety-one neonatal HSV cases were identified (8.4/100,000 live births). Risk factors for infection included maternal age younger than 25 years (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.9, 95% CI 1.1–3.3) and paternal age younger than 20 years or unknown (aOR = 1.7, 95% CI 0.7–3.7). Testing couples with either risk factor would require testing 36% of couples and could potentially prevent up to 60% of cases. Maternal history of genital herpes, fever during labor, and premature rupture of membranes were also associated with neonatal disease; using all risk factors identifiable at delivery would require screening 60% of pregnancies.

### Herpes simplex virus shedding rate: Surrogate outcome for genital herpes recurrence frequency and lesion rates, and phase 2 clinical trials end point for evaluating efficacy of antivirals [^113sgWpF]. Journal of Infectious Diseases (2018). High credibility.

We tested whether genital herpes simplex virus (HSV) shedding is an appropriate surrogate outcome for the clinical outcome of genital herpes lesions in studies of HSV-2 antiviral interventions.

- **Methods**: We analyzed prospective data from natural history studies and clinical trials of antiviral agents for HSV-2 in which HSV-2-seropositive participants provided self-collected anogenital swab specimens daily over ≥ 25 days for HSV DNA quantitation by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Genital recurrences were self-reported.

- **Results**: Among 674 participants, genital HSV shedding was detected on 17% of days, and genital lesions were reported on 10% of days. Within the same session, HSV shedding rates were strongly correlated with lesion rates (ρ = 0.61, P < .0001). The relative reduction in the recurrence rate was 72% (P = .041) for recipients of the antiviral agent pritelivir as compared to recipients of placebo, but it decreased to 21% (P = .75) after adjustment for HSV shedding rate. When evaluating valacyclovir and acyclovir, adjustment for the HSV shedding rate also led to a reduced association of these antivirals with the recurrence rate. Overall, 40%-82% of the antiviral effect on recurrences was explained by its effect on HSV shedding.

- **Conclusion**: HSV genital shedding measured by PCR analysis in swab specimens self-collected daily is an appropriate surrogate outcome for genital herpes lesions because it is in the causal pathway to recurrences.

### Genital herpes: Rapid evidence review [^116D33iw]. American Family Physician (2024). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for genital herpes, particularly laboratory testing, the AAFP 2024 guidelines recommend obtaining type-specific serologic testing for HSV-2 when there is higher clinical suspicion for HSV-2. This is applicable in cases such as recurrent episodes, atypical lesions, lesions with negative PCR or culture results, or in the presence of HIV infection.

### Rapid diagnosis of herpes simplex virus 1 and 2 bloodstream infections utilizing a sample-to-answer platform [^115yvpAc]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2024). High credibility.

Herpes simplex viruses are among the most ubiquitous in human infections. In most cases, HSV infections in individuals with an intact immune system are relatively mild and can cause discomfort, but often go unnoticed. In rare instances, HSV can enter the bloodstream, leading to more severe manifestations affecting multiple regions of the skin, the viscera, and the central nervous system. This is especially true for neonates and individuals with an immunocompromised status, for whom HSV infections or reactivations can be life-threatening. Neonatal disseminated HSV infection, for example, can result in devastating outcomes, with an untreated mortality rate of approximately 80% and up to 30% even with antiviral therapy. In solid organ transplantation recipients, HSV infection or reactivation can also lead to more severe manifestations, including esophagitis, hepatitis, pneumonitis, and potential graft loss. Therefore, achieving a rapid, accurate, and definitive diagnosis of HSV bloodstream infections is crucial in clinical settings. Rapid diagnosis enables timely administration of antiviral treatment, influences patient management decisions for those at high risk, and can contribute to shorter hospital stays, thereby reducing healthcare costs.

### Genome-wide surveillance of genital herpes simplex virus type 1 from multiple anatomic sites over time [^115JLQ2c]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

This is the first study to examine anatomically separated genital HSV-1 shedding patterns for a single participant over a multiday period (Figure 1). We present data from an individual with frequent genital HSV-1 lesions and a high rate of viral shedding, even several years into her infection. Recurrences of genital HSV-1 after the first year occur in only 5% of infected individuals. We found that v.29 had unique phylogenetic signatures and did not cluster with known HSV-1 genomes (Figure 2). V.29 also had a unique truncation in the UL11 viral tegument protein (Figure 3).

We observed conservation in viral genomes — at the consensus level — between swab specimens collected over 3 days and cultured specimens collected over 4 months (Figure 4). However, at the level of MVs, we observed a > 2-fold decrease in the average number of MVs — and a 6-fold decrease in genic MVs — in nonlesion swab specimens and cultures relative to the lesion specimens (Figure 5).

The available data indicate that this participant has a typical CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell response (Figure 6), although it is possible that a quantitative or qualitative difference in these responses is casually associated with her clinical phenotype. These data suggest that viral genomic factors may be impacting the relatively severe clinical phenotype that this participant experiences. Alternatively, she may not have localized HSV-1–specific T-cells to the genital region, either acutely during recurrences or chronically as tissue-resident memory cells that locally persist after resolution of episodic infection.

### Genital shedding of herpes simplex virus among symptomatic and asymptomatic persons with HSV-2 infection [^113XbwAr]. JAMA (2011). Low credibility.

Since herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) antibody tests have become commercially available, an increasing number of persons have learned that they have genital herpes through serologic testing. The course of natural history of HSV-2 in asymptomatic, seropositive persons is uncertain.

- **Objective**: To evaluate the virologic and clinical course of HSV genital shedding among individuals with symptomatic and asymptomatic HSV-2 infection.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: Cohort of 498 immunocompetent HSV-2-seropositive persons enrolled in prospective studies of genital HSV shedding at the University of Washington Virology Research Clinic, Seattle, and Westover Heights Clinic, Portland, Oregon, between March 1992 and April 2008. Each participant obtained daily self-collected swabs of genital secretions for at least 30 days.

- **Main outcome measure**: The rate of viral shedding measured by quantitative real-time fluorescence polymerase chain reaction for HSV DNA from genital swabs.

- **Results**: Herpes simplex virus type 2 was detected on 4753 of 23,683 days (20.1%; 95% confidence interval, 18.3%-22.0%) in 410 persons with symptomatic genital HSV-2 infection compared with 519 of 5070 days (10.2%; 95% CI, 7.7%-13.6%) in 88 persons with asymptomatic infection (P < .001). Subclinical shedding rates were higher in persons with symptomatic infection compared with asymptomatic infection (2708 of 20,735 days [13.1%; 95% CI, 11.5%-14.6%]) vs 434 of 4929 days [8.8%; 95% CI, 6.3%-11.5%]) (P < .001). However, the amount of HSV detected during subclinical shedding episodes was similar.
