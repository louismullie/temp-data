## Question

How should circumferential external hemorrhoids be managed?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how circumferential external hemorrhoids should be managed. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying the clinical entity and how it relates to grading systems. Then, I should review first-line conservative measures and when they are insufficient. Next, I will evaluate the role and limitations of office-based procedures. After that, I need to delineate surgical indications and match surgical options to specific presentations, including thrombosis. Finally, I should outline postoperative care and synthesize a practical algorithm while checking for guideline concordance and areas of controversy.

> Let me first confirm the entity I am dealing with. "Circumferential external hemorrhoids" describes extensive disease involving most or all of the anal circumference, often with mixed internal and external components; true external hemorrhoids are distal to the dentate line with somatic innervation and are typically painful, and this construct does not map neatly to Goligher grading, which classifies internal prolapse from I to IV, so I need to be careful not to misapply internal-only grading to circumferential mixed disease.

> I need to ensure initial management aligns with guideline-first principles. Hold on, let me verify the conservative measures: high-fiber diet with adequate hydration, avoidance of straining and prolonged toilet time, stool regulation with osmotic agents, and short-course topical therapy for pain or spasm are recommended as first-line across guidelines; flavonoids can be considered for symptom relief with low harm, although they are adjunctive and not curative for extensive disease, and these measures remain important perioperatively even when surgery is anticipated [^114scXLx] [^113d8Frc] [^1146VGWC] [^114MqQ26] [^116tNruW] [^1155SYvZ] [^111m2SrT].

> Wait, I initially thought office-based procedures like rubber band ligation might be a next step for persistent symptoms; but I should double-check candidacy in circumferential external disease. Rubber band ligation is preferred for grades I–III internal hemorrhoids and is not appropriate for extensive external components, and in complicated or circumferential presentations, WSES-AAST notes insufficient evidence for office procedures; infrared coagulation and sclerotherapy target internal tissue and won't address a dominant circumferential external component, so I should not overextend these modalities here [^112hNpeN] [^116kpfDa] [^1124a8fG].

> Next, I should review when to pivot to surgery. Let me verify the indications: failure of conservative therapy, combined internal/external disease with grade III–IV features, extensive prolapse, large external components or tags, or circumferential thrombosis all favor operative management; ASCRS specifically recommends excisional hemorrhoidectomy for selected patients with external or combined grade III–IV disease, and primary care guidance aligns by reserving excision for higher-grade, recurrent, or highly symptomatic cases, with ACG supporting excisional approaches for symptomatic grade III disease [^113Nr2GA] [^116NshuA].

> I will now examine the role of circumferential excisional hemorrhoidectomy when disease is extensive, especially with massive thrombosis and external burden. A Whitehead-style modification creating a submucoanodermal plane allows precise vein excision while preserving anoderm, with reconstruction designed to reduce stenosis risk; prospective data in total hemorrhoidal thrombosis report acceptable operative times and favorable functional outcomes, but I should acknowledge this is lower-level evidence and technique-dependent, necessitating surgeon expertise and careful patient selection [^113oRDsL].

> Let me consider stapled hemorrhoidopexy when internal prolapse predominates in a circumferential pattern. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: although stapled hemorrhoidopexy tends to reduce early pain and speed recovery, higher long-term recurrence versus conventional excisional hemorrhoidectomy has been consistently observed, and specific randomized work comparing circumferential versus partial stapling informs technical nuance; counseling should include risks of persistent discomfort, fibrosis, stenosis, and rare severe complications, so this is better reserved for predominant internal circumferential prolapse rather than external-dominant disease [^116wxdyh] [^1128nXNW] [^112RBNsL].

> I should review conventional excisional alternatives for circumferential prolapse with substantial skin tags. A modified Ferguson hemorrhoidectomy has been reported in large series to be feasible with low tag recurrence and acceptable complication rates, and can be tailored to reconstruct the anoderm, though again this is based on lower-quality data and requires operative experience to minimize stenosis and incontinence risks [^111GjE9f].

> But wait, what about laser hemorrhoidoplasty in this setting? I need to check current recommendations. LHP is supported as a primary option for grade 2–3 internal hemorrhoids, with guideline suggestions about anesthesia choice and wavelength, and it can be combined with dearterialization and mucopexy for more advanced disease; however, external hemorrhoids and skin tags should be managed individually based on expectations and are not an essential component of standard LHP, and routine postoperative anti-inflammatory suppositories are discouraged; net, LHP is not a standalone solution for extensive circumferential external disease and may serve only as an adjunct for selected external tags after addressing the internal component [^113Tum91] [^115vWYY9] [^114XhBsK] [^111ouZ4b] [^113E7bgq] [^111cxb6d] [^115N3F2k] [^117BsQG5].

> Special scenario check: thrombosed components. I should confirm timing recommendations because they differ across guidelines. Early presentation within about 72 hours favors urgent excision for pain relief per AAFP, with ASCRS advising early surgical excision in selected patients; WSES-AAST recommends against simple incision and drainage due to inferior outcomes, whereas ACG allows incision and evacuation or excision within four days, highlighting a discrepancy that necessitates shared decision-making and local expertise; in later presentations, conservative management is reasonable with analgesia and topical muscle relaxants, acknowledging slower symptom resolution and potential for recurrence [^1139mGGp] [^111wfR2E] [^116rKskB] [^116N2x7f] [^116UkJZh] [^1155SYvZ] [^112zEGJi] [^114oBmgs].

> Next, I should review postoperative care to minimize complications and recurrence. Let me verify essentials: a strict bowel regimen with fiber and stool softeners is important to avoid straining and protect the suture line, multimodal analgesia including NSAIDs with topical antispasmodics can reduce pain, and after LHP specifically, routine anti-inflammatory suppositories are not recommended; structured follow-up should screen for bleeding, stenosis, fissure, and symptom recurrence [^114MqQ26] [^114oBmgs] [^117BsQG5].

> Finally, let me synthesize an algorithm and sanity-check it against the evidence. Start with optimized conservative therapy for 2–4 weeks and address bowel habits; if circumferential external or mixed grade III–IV disease persists, prioritize surgery with technique selection driven by the ratio of external to internal components and presence of acute thrombosis; for external-dominant or circumferential thrombosis, circumferential excisional hemorrhoidectomy by an experienced surgeon is appropriate, for predominant internal circumferential prolapse consider stapled hemorrhoidopexy with explicit counseling on recurrence, and for circumferential prolapse with significant tags a modified Ferguson approach can be selected; reserve laser for adjunctive management of tags and for grade 2–3 internal disease as per guideline scope; throughout, incorporate patient preference and local expertise, especially when addressing thrombosis timing where recommendations diverge [^114scXLx] [^113Nr2GA] [^1128bFBY] [^116wxdyh] [^115XGDJo] [^111GjE9f] [^113Tum91] [^116UkJZh].

Circumferential external hemorrhoids are best managed with a **stepwise approach**, starting with conservative measures, including fiber, fluids, sitz baths, and topical agents [^114scXLx] and escalating to surgery if symptoms persist or complications arise [^114scXLx] [^1128nXNW]. For acute thrombosis, **early excision** within 72 hours [^1139mGGp] is preferred for rapid relief and lower recurrence [^112zEGJi], whereas after 72 hours, conservative care is reasonable. Excisional hemorrhoidectomy is the **gold standard** for extensive disease [^116wxdyh], with stapled or laser options for select cases [^113Tum91]. Office procedures are **not recommended** for circumferential external disease [^113Nr2GA] [^116kpfDa]. Postoperative care focuses on pain control, stool softeners [^114oBmgs], and infection prevention, with **close follow-up** to monitor for recurrence or complications.

---

## Conservative management

Conservative management is the **initial approach** [^114scXLx] for circumferential external hemorrhoids, particularly in patients without acute thrombosis or severe symptoms. The following measures are **recommended**:

- **Dietary and behavioral modifications**: Increased dietary fiber intake [^114scXLx], adequate hydration [^112MKBGH], and avoidance of straining during defecation [^1146VGWC] are primary first-line therapies.

- **Pharmacotherapy**: Topical agents, such as corticosteroids and local anesthetics, may provide symptomatic relief [^114MqQ26]. However, their use should be limited due to potential side effects with prolonged use [^113d8Frc].

- **Sitz baths**: Warm water sitz baths can help reduce pain and inflammation.

Conservative management is **generally effective** [^112MKBGH] for mild to moderate symptoms but **may be insufficient** for severe or thrombosed circumferential external hemorrhoids [^113Nr2GA].

---

## Surgical management

Surgical intervention is **indicated** [^113Nr2GA] for circumferential external hemorrhoids **when conservative measures fail** or when complications such as thrombosis, severe pain, or significant prolapse occur [^116NshuA]. The following surgical options are **available**:

---

### Excisional hemorrhoidectomy

Excisional hemorrhoidectomy is considered the **gold standard** [^113Nr2GA] for circumferential external hemorrhoids, particularly in cases of extensive disease or acute thrombosis. This procedure involves the complete excision of hemorrhoidal tissue, providing **definitive treatment** with low recurrence rates [^1128nXNW]. Indications include symptomatic **circumferential external hemorrhoids**, **acute thrombosis**, and recurrent or highly symptomatic hemorrhoids [^1128nXNW]. Outcomes include effective **symptom relief** and low recurrence rates, but are accompanied by **significant postoperative pain** and a longer recovery time [^116wxdyh].

---

### Stapled hemorrhoidopexy

Stapled hemorrhoidopexy is **primarily indicated** for internal hemorrhoids but may be considered in **selected cases** of circumferential external hemorrhoids with significant internal components. This procedure involves the circumferential excision of prolapsed mucosa and submucosa, repositioning hemorrhoidal tissue above the dentate line. Indications are **limited** to such cases. Outcomes include **less postoperative pain** and **faster recovery** compared with excisional hemorrhoidectomy [^116wxdyh], but at the cost of **higher recurrence rates** [^1128nXNW] and potential complications such as rectal stenosis and persistent pain [^115XGDJo].

---

### Laser hemorrhoidoplasty

Laser hemorrhoidoplasty is a **minimally invasive** technique that uses laser energy to shrink hemorrhoidal tissue [^113Tum91]. It is primarily indicated for internal hemorrhoids but may be considered in **selected cases** of circumferential external hemorrhoids. Indications are based on **surgeon expertise** and **patient expectations** [^111ouZ4b]. Outcomes include **reduced postoperative pain** and **faster recovery**, but long-term data are limited and there is potential for recurrence [^113Tum91].

---

## Management of acute thrombosis

Acute thrombosis is a **common complication** of circumferential external hemorrhoids, characterized by severe pain and swelling. Within 72 hours of symptom onset, **early surgical excision** [^111wfR2E] provides rapid symptom relief and lowers recurrence rates. Conservative management is appropriate for patients presenting **after 72 hours** and includes analgesics, topical agents, and sitz baths [^116N2x7f].

---

## Postoperative care and follow-up

Postoperative care is **essential** to ensure optimal recovery and prevent complications:

- **Pain management**: NSAIDs, acetaminophen, and topical anesthetics [^111DKR4P].

- **Stool softeners**: To prevent constipation and reduce strain during defecation [^114oBmgs].

- **Wound care**: Regular cleaning, sitz baths, and monitoring for infection.

- **Follow-up**: Regular follow-up visits to monitor healing, manage complications, and provide patient education [^114scXLx].

---

## Complications and recurrence

Potential **complications** include:

- **Pain**: Common after excisional hemorrhoidectomy [^116wxdyh].

- **Bleeding**: May occur postoperatively [^114MqQ26].

- **Infection**: Rare but possible [^114oBmgs].

- **Recurrence**: Lower with excisional hemorrhoidectomy, higher with stapled hemorrhoidopexy [^116wxdyh] and laser hemorrhoidoplasty [^113Tum91].

---

Circumferential external hemorrhoids are managed with a **stepwise approach**, beginning with conservative measures and escalating to surgical intervention as needed [^114scXLx]. Excisional hemorrhoidectomy is the **gold standard**, while stapled hemorrhoidopexy and laser hemorrhoidoplasty are alternatives for selected cases.

### Thrombosed external hemorrhoids: Outcome after conservative or surgical management [^112zbyiz]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2004). Low credibility.

Few data exist on the actual recurrence rates of thrombosed external hemorrhoids. We wished to determine the incidence of recurrence, intervals to recurrence, and factors predicting recurrence of thrombosed external hemorrhoids after conservative or surgical management.

Two hundred and thirty-one consecutive patients with thrombosed external hemorrhoids treated from 1990 to 2002 were identified. Recurrence was defined as complete resolution of the index lesion with subsequent return of a thrombosed external hemorrhoid and did not include patients with chronic symptoms. Data were gathered retrospectively. Multiple potential risk factors were reviewed.

The index thrombosed external hemorrhoid was managed conservatively in 51.5 percent of cases and surgically in 48.5 percent. There were no differences between groups in gender, age, or race, and 44.5 percent of all patients had a prior history of thrombosed external hemorrhoids. A prior history was less common in the conservative group than in the surgical group (38.1 percent vs. 51.3 percent; P < 0.05). The frequency of pain or bleeding as the primary complaint was higher in the surgical group (P < 0.001 and P < 0.002). In addition, the surgical group was more likely to report all three symptoms of pain, bleeding, and a lump (P < 0.005).

Mean follow-up was 7.6 months, with the range extending to 7 years. Time to symptom resolution averaged 24 days in the conservative group vs. 3.9 days in the surgical group (P < 0.0001). The overall incidence to recurrence was 15.6 percent.

In the design of this trial, we initially hypothesized that "up to 2 RBL treatments are noninferior to hemorrhoidectomy in terms of quality of life and recurrence risk, whereas being more cost-effective". Our findings challenge this assumption, showing that while RBL offers lower upfront costs, hemorrhoidectomy provides better long-term clinical outcomes, including reduced recurrence and improved quality of life. For patients with grade III hemorrhoids, hemorrhoidectomy may be more cost-effective than RBL, and therefore, caution is needed before discarding it as a routine first-line treatment solely based on rising health care costs or limited operating room availability.

Benign anorectal disease is commonly encountered in clinical practices across specialties, and hemorrhoids, fissures, and fistulas continue to significantly affect patients' lives. Hemorrhoids and fissures frequently benefit from non-operative management but occasionally require surgery. In contrast, the treatment of anorectal abscesses and fistulas is mainly surgical. The aim of this review is to examine the etiology, diagnosis, and both medical and surgical treatment for these benign anorectal diseases.

### Hemorrhoidectomy for thrombosed external hemorrhoids [^114oBmgs]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

External hemorrhoids represent distended vascular tissue in the anal canal distal to the dentate line. Individuals with thrombosed external hemorrhoids typically present with pain during standing, sitting, or defecation. Acutely tender, thrombosed external hemorrhoids can be surgically removed if encountered within the first 72 hours after onset. Hemorrhoidectomy involves an elliptic incision over the site of thrombosis with removal of the entire diseased hemorrhoidal plexus in one piece. Caution must be exercised to avoid cutting into the muscle sphincter below the hemorrhoidal vessels. Infection after suture closure is rare due to the rich vascular network in the anal area. Postoperative prescription of stool softeners is necessary to help prevent tearing at the suture line. Training and experience in general and skin surgery are necessary before attempting this procedure unsupervised.

Regarding surgical interventions for hemorrhoids, specifically laser hemorrhoidoplasty, the LHP-RDG 2024 guidelines suggest managing external hemorrhoids and skin tags individually based on patient expectations. However, they recommend not making this management an essential part of the standard laser hemorrhoidoplasty procedure.

### Comparison of rubber band ligation and hemorrhoidectomy in patients with symptomatic hemorrhoids grade III: A multicenter, open-label, randomized controlled noninferiority trial [^117QFtBC]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2025). High credibility.

Dutch guidelines for grade III hemorrhoids include shared decision-making, presenting hemorrhoidectomy or initial rubber band ligation (RBL) as options, and recommending surgery if symptoms persist after four RBL sessions. In our study, only one patient exceeded this threshold, opting out of surgery.

In the hemorrhoidectomy group, one patient required a second Ligasure procedure, which successfully resolved symptoms. No differences in outcomes were observed between open and closed excisional techniques. Self-reported recurrence rates in this study were lower than those reported in the eTHoS trial (0% vs. 14% at 12 months and 6.7% vs. 25% at 24 months), likely due to our focus on grade III hemorrhoids. Conversely, recurrence rates were higher than those reported in our previous meta-analysis (31% for RBL vs. 6% for hemorrhoidectomy). However, the studies included in the meta-analysis were of poor quality, particularly in their definitions of recurrence and follow-up periods.

The skewed treatment allocation (47 vs. 40) resulted from stratification by the center with permuted blocks of random sizes, but baseline characteristics remained comparable. Notably, 42% of patients met the Rome IV criteria for functional constipation, emphasizing the importance of addressing underlying bowel issues when planning hemorrhoid treatment. The shorter waiting time for RBL intervention may provide an advantage in quickly managing severe symptoms. However, the median waiting time for surgery in our study (50 days; IQR, 27–88) was still shorter than reported in other studies.

Both groups experienced minimal complications.

### Cost-effectiveness of rubber band ligation versus hemorrhoidectomy for the treatment of grade III hemorrhoids: Analysis using evidence from the HOLLAND randomized controlled trial [^116zzXbt]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2025). High credibility.

Hemorrhoidal disease is a common condition that significantly impacts quality of life and health care costs. Treatment decisions are often guided by the Goligher classification, with surgical intervention recommended when conservative measures fail. However, for grade III hemorrhoids, there is no consensus on the optimal treatment strategy, leading to variability in clinical practice.

Two common treatment options are rubber band ligation (RBL), a minimally invasive outpatient procedure with relatively low upfront costs, and hemorrhoidectomy, the criterion standard, which is more invasive and costly but generally provides more durable symptom relief. Although RBL is frequently chosen as a first-line treatment, repeat procedures are often required, raising concerns about cumulative costs and the prolonged impact on quality of life. These additional costs result not only from additional health care resources but also from indirect costs, such as productivity losses due to prolonged treatment durations and recovery periods.

This variability underscores the need to assess not only clinical outcomes but also economic implications. With rising health care expenses, cost-effectiveness has become a critical consideration in managing hemorrhoidal disease. Logically, recent studies have begun to investigate the cost-effectiveness of various surgical procedures. However, despite these findings, direct health-economic comparisons of RBL and hemorrhoidectomy for grade III hemorrhoids are limited. One retrospective study favored repeated banding over hemorrhoidectomy.

### The American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons clinical practice guidelines for the management of hemorrhoids [^113AF9vT]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2018). High credibility.

Goligher's classification of internal hemorrhoids is a clinical tool designed for the grading and management of internal hemorrhoids. This classification system is based on the physical findings of hemorrhoidal vessels and their behavior during a Valsalva maneuver, which is a forced exhalation against a closed airway, often used in clinical settings to evaluate the condition of the heart and lungs.

The primary components of this classification system include the prominence of hemorrhoidal vessels and the presence and degree of prolapse. The system classifies hemorrhoids into four grades:

- **Grade I**: Characterized by prominent hemorrhoidal vessels without prolapse.
- **Grade II**: Hemorrhoids prolapse with a Valsalva maneuver but reduce spontaneously.
- **Grade III**: Hemorrhoids also prolapse with a Valsalva maneuver but require manual reduction.
- **Grade IV**: Hemorrhoids are chronically prolapsed and cannot be manually reduced.

The clinical utility of Goligher's classification lies in its ability to guide treatment decisions. The grade of hemorrhoids can influence the choice of therapeutic interventions, ranging from conservative management for lower grades to surgical interventions for higher grades. This classification system also provides a standardized language for clinicians to communicate about the severity and management of internal hemorrhoids.

### Common design and data elements on rectal artery embolization for treatment of symptomatic internal hemorrhoidal disease: an interactive systematic review of clinical trials [^116vHo6i]. CVIR Endovascular (2024). High credibility.

Internal hemorrhoids (IH) are a common medical condition that can result in morbidity due to bleeding and discomfort. Treatment for IH has traditionally consisted of dietary and conservative medical management, in addition to focal treatments including banding, sclerotherapy, or hemorrhoidectomy. Recently, rectal artery embolization (RAE) has been studied as a potential treatment for bleeding-predominant IH. We performed a common design and data element analysis of studies that report on RAE.

- **Materials and methods**: We conducted a qualitative systematic literature review for rectal artery embolization (RAE) in symptomatic hemorrhoidal disease. The screening process involved five online databases: PubMed, Embase, Google Scholar, DOAJ, and Scopus. Additionally, ClinicalTrials.gov was examined for active, unpublished, completed studies. The initial search yielded 2000 studies, with 15 studies meeting the inclusion criteria after screening and assessment. The included studies comprised one RCT, one case series, one pilot study, and 12 cohort studies.

- **Results**: The population analysis revealed a male predominance across all studies, with varying cohort sizes. The baseline Goligher hemorrhoid grade was utilized in 80% of the studies. The majority (73.3%) employed a transfemoral approach, with coils as the primary embolic material in 60% of studies. A combination of coils and particles was used in 26.6% of studies, while particles only were used in 6.6% of studies. Patient selection criteria highlighted RAE's applicability for high surgical risk patients and those with anemia, chronic hematochezia, or treatment-refractory disease.

### Hemorrhoids: Diagnosis and treatment options [^114MqQ26]. American Family Physician (2018). Low credibility.

Many Americans between 45 and 65 years of age experience hemorrhoids. Hemorrhoidal size, thrombosis, and location (i.e. proximal or distal to the dentate line) determine the extent of pain or discomfort. The history and physical examination must assess risk factors and clinical signs indicating more concerning disease processes. Internal hemorrhoids are traditionally graded from I to IV based on the extent of prolapse. Other factors such as the degree of discomfort, bleeding, comorbidities, and patient preference should help determine the order in which treatments are pursued.

Medical management, including stool softeners, topical over-the-counter preparations, and topical nitroglycerine, along with dietary modifications like increased fiber and water intake, and behavioral therapies such as sitz baths, are the mainstays of initial therapy. If these are unsuccessful, office-based treatment of grades I to III internal hemorrhoids with rubber band ligation is the preferred next step because it has a lower failure rate than infrared photocoagulation.

Open or closed (conventional) excisional hemorrhoidectomy leads to greater surgical success rates but also incurs more pain and a prolonged recovery than office-based procedures; therefore, hemorrhoidectomy should be reserved for recurrent or higher-grade disease. Closed hemorrhoidectomy with diathermic or ultrasonic cutting devices may decrease bleeding and pain. Stapled hemorrhoidopexy elevates grade III or IV hemorrhoids to their normal anatomic position by removing a band of proximal mucosal tissue; however, this procedure has several potential complications.

### Circumferential excisional hemorrhoidectomy for extensive acute thrombosis: a 14-year experience [^113oRDsL]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2011). Low credibility.

Recurrence and/or complications after 3-quadrant hemorrhoidectomy or stapled hemorrhoidopexy remain a challenging problem, particularly for massive hemorrhoidal thrombosis leading to edema, ulceration, and/or gangrene. To address this issue, we developed a modification of the Whitehead procedure, termed circumferential excisional hemorrhoidectomy. This procedure allows access to a submucoanodermal/skin workspace, providing a "view from inside" the hemorrhoidal disease, which facilitates the precise excision of each hemorrhoidal vein while preserving the overlying normal tissues.

- **Objective**: This study aimed to describe the circumferential excisional hemorrhoidectomy procedure and demonstrate its results in patients presenting with total hemorrhoidal thrombosis.

- **Design, Settings, Patients**: This prospective, descriptive study was conducted with 294 consecutive patients who underwent urgent circumferential excisional hemorrhoidectomy at our coloproctological center from January 1996 to June 2009.

- **Intervention**: Circumferential excisional hemorrhoidectomy involves stripping and excising hemorrhoids from the submucoanodermal space, with reconstruction of the anal canal using an undermined irregular/zigzag-shaped mucoanodermal flap and accurately trimmed skin.

- **Main Outcome Measures**: The main outcome measures were the surgical outcomes and complications.

- **Results**: The mean patient age was 41.7 for both sexes, comprising 215 men and 79 women. The mean operative time was 26.4 minutes (range, 17–43 minutes).

Treatment outcomes and clinical success rates in internal hemorrhoid management

Various outcome assessments have been utilized to evaluate the efficacy of treatments for hemorrhoids, with clinical success rates serving as a primary measure of effectiveness. Studies such as those conducted by Sun et al. (2018), Puchol et al. (2020), and Küçükay et al. (2021) have consistently reported high clinical success rates ranging from 83.4% to 93%. Clinical success encompasses a range of factors including symptom resolution, improvement in quality of life, and patient satisfaction. Additionally, outcome assessments such as the Goligher's grading system (GPS), French Bleeding Score (FBS), Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for pain, and quality of life scores (QOLS) have been detailed for quantifying treatment outcomes.

### Hemorrhoids [^111DKR4P]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Most patients with hemorrhoids experience only mild symptoms that can be treated with nonprescription topical preparations. Patients usually seek treatment when symptoms increase. Internal hemorrhoids typically present with prolapse or painless rectal bleeding. External hemorrhoids also bleed and can cause acute pain if thrombosed.

Medical therapy should be initiated with stool softeners plus local therapy to relieve swelling and symptoms. If medical therapy is inadequate, surgical intervention is warranted. Rubber band ligation is the treatment of choice for grades 1 and 2 hemorrhoids. For patients with grade 3 hemorrhoids, rubber band ligation, excisional hemorrhoidectomy, or stapled hemorrhoidopexy can be performed. Rubber band ligation causes less postoperative pain and fewer complications than excisional hemorrhoidectomy and stapled hemorrhoidopexy but has a higher recurrence rate.

Excisional hemorrhoidectomy or stapled hemorrhoidopexy is recommended for the treatment of grade 4 hemorrhoids. Stapled hemorrhoidopexy has a faster postoperative recovery, but a higher recurrence rate. Postoperative pain from excisional hemorrhoidectomy can be treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, narcotics, fiber supplements, and topical antispasmodics. Thrombosed external hemorrhoids can be treated conservatively or excised.

### Pathophysiology of internal hemorrhoids [^112nkkP9]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2019). Low credibility.

Hemorrhoids are normal structures of the human body. Internal hemorrhoids arise from the internal hemorrhoidal plexus, while external hemorrhoids arise from the external plexus. The anatomical boundary that divides the internal from the external hemorrhoidal plexus is the dentate line. The normal internal hemorrhoidal plexus consists of three soft engorgements, referred to as anal cushions or "hemorrhoids". Consequently, the term "internal hemorrhoids" does not signify a state of disease if viewed in its strict literal definition. However, in clinical practice, the term "internal hemorrhoids" is used to describe solely the disease resulting from the abnormal enlargement of anal cushions, i.e. their transformation into anal nodules. More precisely, this definition is limited to symptomatic hemorrhoidal disease; i.e. anal cushions are named "hemorrhoids" when they bleed and/or prolapse.

The internal hemorrhoidal plexus is located submucosally above the dentate line and below the anorectal ring, extending from the upper border of the anatomical anal canal to the upper border of the surgical anal canal. It is located, therefore, outside the anatomical anal canal. The plexus is covered by transitional columnar epithelium and originates embryologically from the cloacal part of the anal canal, which contains both ectodermal and endodermal elements. This epithelium is approximately 1 cm long and, as anatomically authentic rectal epithelium, secretes mucus and is not innervated by visceral pain fibers.

### Common design and data elements on rectal artery embolization for treatment of symptomatic internal hemorrhoidal disease: An interactive systematic review of clinical trials [^115kqZyH]. CVIR Endovascular (2024). High credibility.

The American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons (ASCRS) and the European Society of Coloproctology (ESCP) have established evidence-based clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of symptomatic hemorrhoidal disease, which were updated in 2024 and 2020, respectively. These guidelines outline a systematic approach to the diagnosis of hemorrhoidal disease, as well as a treatment approach based on hemorrhoidal grades (I–IV) in the Goligher classification system. There are numerous medical options, including dietary measures and phlebotonics. Office-based procedural options consist of rubber band ligation (RBL), infrared photocoagulation, bipolar diathermy, and sclerotherapy. Surgical options include hemorrhoidectomy, hemorrhoidopexy, and transanal hemorrhoidal dearterialization. These treatment options have well-established safety and efficacy profiles. However, high recurrence rates of bleeding are not uncommon after standard-of-care therapies, prompting investigation into new therapeutic approaches.

Histopathologic evaluation has identified that hemorrhoids are vascular structures arising from channels of arteriovenous connective tissues with arterial supply from the superior, middle, and/or inferior rectal (hemorrhoidal) arteries that drain into the superior and inferior hemorrhoidal veins. Based on this observation, there are arteriovenous connections within hemorrhoids with an arterial inflow to the corpus cavernosum recti. Doppler-guided hemorrhoidal artery ligation (HAL) was introduced as a treatment option for internal hemorrhoids (IH). Doppler-guided hemorrhoid artery ligation is performed via…

### Pathophysiology of internal hemorrhoids [^111oiz4A]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2019). Low credibility.

Overall, hemorrhoidal disease is a quite common and annoying disease, by definition symptomatic. It is imperative for clinicians who manage patients with internal hemorrhoids (gastroenterologists, surgeons, general practitioners) to be familiar with the normal and abnormal anatomy of hemorrhoids and to be capable of correlating their clinical findings with the subsequent pathophysiology. The pathophysiological explanation of clinical and/or endoscopic signs is an indispensable component of the roadmap to the successful treatment of the hemorrhoidal patient.

### Pathophysiology of internal hemorrhoids [^114PFx4W]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2019). Low credibility.

Hemorrhoidal disease is a fairly common and debilitating clinical entity. Despite centuries of attempts to shed light on its pathophysiology, to cure those affected, and to improve sufferers' quality of life, many aspects of the disease remain elusive. Individual beliefs and historical legends, accompanied by undocumented theories, have established and perpetuated the confusion regarding the mechanisms leading to the development of the disease and the rules governing its treatment. Hemorrhoids are classified as internal or external and are viewed as a disease when they become symptomatic.

Returning to basic medical sciences, this mini-review focuses on internal hemorrhoids and aims to define the histology and anatomy of the normal and abnormal internal hemorrhoidal plexus, encouraging clinicians to comprehend the pathophysiology of the disease. If doctors can understand the pathophysiology of hemorrhoidal disease, they will be able to clarify the nature of the associated symptoms and complications and to make the correct therapeutic decisions.

### A modified Ferguson hemorrhoidectomy for circumferential prolapsed hemorrhoids with skin tags [^111GjE9f]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2008). Low credibility.

We describe a modification of the Ferguson hemorrhoidectomy for circumferential prolapsed hemorrhoids. This details the operative procedure and compares the results of other radical methods in patients with circumferential hemorrhoidal disease.

- **Methods**: A total of 738 patients (mean age, 43 years; range, 19–83 years) were treated with our modified Ferguson method under sedative analgesia between 1989 and 2004. Among them, 576 patients had Grade III hemorrhoids, 162 had Grade IV hemorrhoids, and 131 patients also underwent a partial lateral internal sphincterotomy to correct anal hypertonia.

- **Results**: Postoperative bleeding occurred in 16 patients, with 3 requiring surgical hemostasis. Fecal impaction occurred in 11 patients, and wound complications in 6 patients. Thirty-two patients required bladder catheterization due to acute urinary retention. The median follow-up was 13.2 months in our outpatient department. One patient developed mild gas incontinence, five developed anal stenosis, and three had an anal fissure. Skin tags recurred in only three patients, which did not affect their quality of life.

- **Conclusions**: Our modified Ferguson method represents a good choice for radical treatment of circumferential prolapsed hemorrhoids because it is easy to perform, has few complications, and provides satisfying results.

### Insights into the management of anorectal disease in the coronavirus 2019 disease era [^117538Lu]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). Low credibility.

The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in delays for elective procedures, impacting the proctological management of advanced hemorrhoids. Telemedicine can be a possible alternative in this situation. The traditional risk factors for hemorrhoids include constipation, obesity, and a sedentary lifestyle. These risk factors have increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, adding to the physical and psychological problems of this population.

Hemorrhoids are a benign condition that mostly improves with conservative management, though some cases require surgical intervention. If surgery is delayed in these cases, it can lead to disease progression and complications such as bleeding and pain. Traditionally, hemorrhoids are treated with office procedures, including rubber band ligation, sclerotherapy, and infrared coagulation, and operating room procedures such as hemorrhoidectomy and stapled hemorrhoidopexy for advanced hemorrhoids. Emergent hemorrhoidectomy is recommended for cases with acute thrombosis and strangulation. There are no disease-specific guidelines for the management of hemorrhoids, and all office and elective procedures should be rescheduled during the pandemic.

A recent study has shown that patients with a diagnosis of chronic hemorrhoids before the pandemic experienced worsening of symptoms compared to recently diagnosed cases. Patients were reasonably satisfied with the implementation of telemedicine. Lifestyle changes, including physical activity and weight loss, have led to improvements in hemorrhoid severity scores.

### Hemorrhoids: What are the options in 2018 [^115TLNVQ]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Efforts continue to improve the treatment of patients with symptomatic hemorrhoidal disease through interventions aimed at enhancing efficiency and effectiveness. This includes reducing intraoperative and postoperative pain, decreasing operating times, minimizing blood loss, and controlling symptoms and recurrence rates. Simultaneously, there are renewed efforts to minimize the number of patients requiring procedural intervention by focusing on conservative measures that encourage better bowel regulation and habits. The purpose of this brief report is to review the status of the diagnosis and treatment of patients with hemorrhoidal disease. New procedures or procedural refinements to existing techniques continue to be introduced with promising short-term outcomes, at least in some instances. However, long-term follow-up or equivalency data are still being accumulated, making it controversial to definitively determine the best alternative to traditional hemorrhoidectomy. One challenge is the heterogeneity in diagnosis, intervention, and especially outcomes measures, which makes comparing therapies difficult. A recent initiative to standardize metrics shows promise.

Recent studies largely suggest that conservative treatment approaches and managing patient expectations are critically important. A primary objective should be to minimize the progression to symptomatic disease and complications in patients diagnosed with hemorrhoids.

### Anorectal emergencies: WSES-AAST guidelines [^1146VGWC]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2021). High credibility.

In patients with complicated hemorrhoids, we recommend non-operative management as the first-line therapy, encompassing dietary and lifestyle changes, such as increased fiber and water intake along with adequate bathroom habits (strong recommendation based on moderate quality evidence, 1B).

For patients with complicated hemorrhoids, we suggest administering flavonoids to relieve symptoms (weak recommendation based on moderate quality evidence, 2B).

In cases involving thrombosed or strangulated hemorrhoids, the use of a topical muscle relaxant is suggested (weak recommendation based on low quality evidence, 2C).

No recommendation can be made regarding the use of NSAIDs, topical steroids, other topical agents, or the injection of local anesthetics for complicated hemorrhoids, based on the existing literature.

Medical and pharmacological therapies are the most widely adopted treatments for complicated hemorrhoids and are supported by several studies. A Cochrane review from 2005 investigated the role of laxatives in treating symptomatic hemorrhoids, including seven randomized trials with a total of 378 participants comparing fiber to a non-fiber control. Meta-analyses using random-effects models showed that laxatives in the form of fiber had a beneficial effect on the treatment of symptomatic hemorrhoids, especially in reducing bleeding. However, the authors cautioned that the risk of publication bias and the moderate quality of the included studies might limit the strength of the meta-analysis results.

### Stapled versus conventional surgery for hemorrhoids [^116wxdyh]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). High credibility.

Hemorrhoids are one of the most common anorectal disorders. The Milligan-Morgan open hemorrhoidectomy is the most widely practiced surgical technique for the management of hemorrhoids and is considered the current "gold standard". Circular stapled hemorrhoidopexy was first described by Longo in 1998 as an alternative to conventional excisional hemorrhoidectomy. Early, small randomized controlled trials comparing stapled hemorrhoidopexy with traditional excisional surgery have shown it to be less painful and that it is associated with quicker recovery. The reports also suggest better patient acceptance and higher compliance with day-case procedures, potentially making it more economical.

A previous Cochrane Review of stapled hemorrhoidopexy and conventional excisional surgery has shown that the stapled technique is associated with a higher risk of recurrent hemorrhoids and some symptoms in long-term follow-up. Since this initial review, several more randomized controlled trials have been published that may shed more light on the differences between the novel stapled approach and conventional excisional techniques.

- **Objectives**: This review compares the use of circular stapling devices and conventional excisional techniques in the surgical treatment of hemorrhoids. Its goal is to ascertain whether there is any difference in the outcomes of the two techniques in patients with symptomatic hemorrhoids.

- **Search strategy**: We searched all the major electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) from 1998 to December.

While conventional risk-of-bias assessments for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quality score evaluations for observational studies are common practices in systematic reviews, recommended by the PRISMA guidelines, the scope of this review required a nuanced approach. Our primary objective does not involve assessing the outcomes of specific interventions; instead, the analysis focuses on methodologies, reporting practices, and identification of common data elements in clinical trials of superior rectal artery embolization (RAE) as a treatment for hemorrhoidal disease. The intent is to enhance consistency, transparency, and future comparability of trial outcomes among studies.

### Common design and data elements on rectal artery embolization for treatment of symptomatic internal hemorrhoidal disease: An interactive systematic review of clinical trials [^114nH7kk]. CVIR Endovascular (2024). Low credibility.

Internal hemorrhoids (IH) are a common medical condition that can result in morbidity due to bleeding and discomfort. Traditional treatments for IH consist of dietary and conservative medical management, as well as focal treatments such as banding, sclerotherapy, or hemorrhoidectomy. Recently, rectal artery embolization (RAE) has been studied as a potential treatment for bleeding-predominant IH. We performed an analysis of common design and data elements from studies reporting on RAE.

- **Materials and methods**: We conducted a qualitative systematic literature review for RAE in symptomatic hemorrhoidal disease. The screening process involved five online databases: PubMed, Embase, Google Scholar, DOAJ, and Scopus. Additionally, ClinicalTrials.gov was examined for active, unpublished completed studies. The initial search yielded 2,000 studies, with 15 studies meeting the inclusion criteria after screening and assessment. The included studies comprised one RCT, one case series, one pilot study, and 12 cohort studies.

- **Results**: The population analysis revealed a male predominance across all studies, with varying cohort sizes. The baseline Goligher hemorrhoid grade was utilized in 80% of studies. The majority (73.3%) employed a transfemoral approach, and coils were the primary embolic material in 60% of studies, whereas 26.6% used a combination of coils and particles, and 6.6% used particles only. Patient selection criteria highlighted RAE's applicability for high surgical risk patients and those with anemia, chronic hematochezia, or treatment-refractory cases.

### Endoscopic approaches to the management of hemorrhoids [^113SyWUS]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

The purpose of the review is to examine literature from the past five years regarding the status and future perspectives of endoscopic management of internal hemorrhoids.

Recent findings indicate that despite the significant burden of hemorrhoidal diseases, research on endoscopic treatment approaches has been limited. In the last five years, novel techniques like cap-assisted endoscopic sclerotherapy (CAES) have emerged and are expected to gain more attention. Endoscopists have adopted rubber band ligation as endoscopic rubber band ligation (ERBL), which shows satisfactory results for treating symptomatic hemorrhoids, albeit with common mild post-procedure complications. There is a need for data on head-to-head comparisons between ERBL, endoscopic sclerotherapy, and CAES. Other methods, such as coagulation, remain understudied and require further exploration in endoscopic settings. Meaningful comparisons between these treatment methods have been challenging due to variations in interventional techniques and methods, differences in hemorrhoid grading, and lack of clinical trial standardization. The Goligher classification alone is inadequate for determining the management of symptomatic hemorrhoids, prompting a need for revision.

In summary, gastroenterologists are increasingly positioned to play a significant role in the management of internal hemorrhoids using flexible endoscopy. However, further studies are necessary to evaluate endoscopic treatment options more comprehensively.

### Comparison of rubber band ligation and hemorrhoidectomy in patients with symptomatic hemorrhoids grade III: A multicenter, open-label, randomized controlled noninferiority trial [^115xWbsd]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2025). High credibility.

Hemorrhoidal disease is a common anorectal condition characterized by symptoms such as bleeding, pain, itching, soiling, and prolapse, which can significantly affect quality of life (QoL). In the Netherlands, its prevalence is 13.4 per 1000 patients. The Goligher classification system categorizes hemorrhoids by the degree of hemorrhoidal prolapse and guides treatment strategies.

Grade III hemorrhoids represent a particularly complex management scenario due to inconclusive guidelines regarding optimal treatment strategy. Although hemorrhoidectomy is traditionally considered the criterion standard, rubber band ligation (RBL) offers a simpler, less invasive outpatient alternative with fewer complications and lower patient burden. However, RBL has a recurrence rate of up to 50%, potentially requiring repeat procedures. Although hemorrhoidectomy generally has lower recurrence rates, it is associated with more postoperative discomfort and a longer recovery period.

A consensus on the best treatment strategy for grade III hemorrhoids is lacking, leading to variability in clinical practice. In 2016, two large randomized controlled trials (RCTs) compared stapled hemorrhoidopexy with hemorrhoidectomy and hemorrhoidal artery ligation with RBL. However, a direct comparison of RBL with hemorrhoidectomy is still missing. The present study aimed to address this gap by evaluating the clinical outcomes and cost-effectiveness of RBL versus hemorrhoidectomy in grade III hemorrhoids, focusing on health-related quality of life (HR-QoL) and recurrence rates.

### Novel endoscopic delivery modality of infrared coagulation therapy for internal hemorrhoids [^1124a8fG]. Surgical Endoscopy (2012). Low credibility.

Symptomatic internal hemorrhoid engorgement is a common condition. Symptoms may include bleeding, itching, burning, tissue prolapse, and fecal seepage. Internal hemorrhoids unresponsive to dietary modification and topical and suppository agents may be treated with rubber band ligation, coagulation therapy (infrared beam, electric current, CO2 laser, ultrasonic energy, cryotherapy), or sclerosing agents. These treatments require an anal retractor, adequate lighting, and specialized instruments. Consequently, these requirements often limit the use of such treatment options during screening colonoscopy for rectal bleeding, delaying the treatment of symptoms. This is an inefficient use of time and resources for patients, physicians, and the healthcare system.

The endoscopic infrared coagulator presents a novel and attractive alternative to standard infrared coagulation because it can be performed simultaneously with lower endoscopy through the accessory channel of the endoscope. Endoscopic delivery of infrared coagulation provides improved lighting and visualization compared to anoscopic-guided therapy for symptomatic internal hemorrhoids. After a single session of endoscopic infrared coagulation, patients in this study experienced statistically significant improvement in their symptoms related to internal hemorrhoids.

The authors acknowledge several limitations of this preliminary study. This study utilizes patients as their own internal control, which…

### Pathophysiology of internal hemorrhoids [^1172agXa]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2019). Low credibility.

The question arises: why is the hemorrhoidal vasculature concentrated into three distinct anal cushions? Several theories have been developed, none of which fully explains their formation. The preferential arterial supply into specific locations of the upper anus favors the development of the sinusoidal plexus in these locations almost exclusively. Indeed, the position of the anal cushions corresponds directly to the location of the terminal principal arterial branches in the submucosal tissue: left lateral (3 o'clock), right anterior (11 o'clock), and right posterior (7 o'clock). An alternative explanation is that normal anal cushions are not real protrusions; rather, they represent the unavoidable creases appearing during the closure of the anal canal and disappearing when the anal canal widens during defecation. The aim of these folds is to seal the anal canal in the resting state.

### Novel endoscopic delivery modality of infrared coagulation therapy for internal hemorrhoids [^1172bSvo]. Surgical Endoscopy (2012). Low credibility.

Traditional surgical hemorrhoidectomy involves excising both the internal and external hemorrhoid cushions, resulting in significant postoperative pain. This pain has prompted the development of various nonsurgical treatment options for symptoms primarily related to internal hemorrhoid disease. These nonsurgical treatments include rubber band ligation, infrared coagulation, bipolar diathermy, direct-electrotherapy, sclerotherapy, and cryotherapy. Each of these options induces fibrosis, scarring, shrinkage, and fixation of internal hemorrhoid cushions, thereby minimizing disease symptoms.

Patients with hemorrhoid disease are often advised to undergo a colonoscopy before starting treatment to rule out potential neoplastic sources of symptoms within the colon and rectum. Currently, nonsurgical treatments for internal hemorrhoid disease require the use of an anal retractor (anoscope), dedicated lighting source, and specialized instruments. Furthermore, these treatments are often administered separately from colonoscopy, causing inefficiencies in time and cost for the endoscopist, the endoscopy facility, and the patient.

### Rethinking what we know about hemorrhoids [^111tutFW]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2019). Low credibility.

Although hemorrhoids contribute to significant economic costs and personal suffering, they have received surprisingly little research attention. In the United States, hemorrhoids rank as the third most common outpatient gastrointestinal diagnosis, accounting for nearly 4 million office and emergency department visits annually. The etiology of hemorrhoids remains speculative; a low-fiber diet and constipation have historically been thought to increase the risk of hemorrhoids, but this has not been proven. Symptoms commonly attributed to hemorrhoids include bleeding, pain, pruritus, fecal seepage, prolapse, and mucus discharge. Research indicates that these symptoms were equally reported by patients with and without hemorrhoids.

Medical therapies for hemorrhoids have not been formally studied, with the exception of fiber, where results have been inconsistent. Several office-based interventions, such as rubber band ligation and infrared coagulation, are widely used and economically favorable for practitioners. Surgical procedures are effective at eliminating hemorrhoids, but they may be painful. Given the burden of the disease and numerous gaps in our understanding, the time has come for targeted research to better comprehend the cause, symptoms, and optimal treatment for patients with symptomatic hemorrhoids.

### Anorectal emergencies: WSES-AAST guidelines [^114oZaux]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2021). Low credibility.

No recommendation can be made regarding the role of office-based procedures (i.e. rubber band ligation, sclerotherapy, infrared coagulation) in complicated hemorrhoids, based on the available literature. The literature regarding the utilization of office-based procedures (i.e. rubber band ligation, injection sclerotherapy, infrared coagulation, cryotherapy, radiofrequency ablation, laser therapy, etc) is significant but generally heterogeneous and of low quality. The number of published studies is enormous, and the definition of bleeding or symptomatic hemorrhoids is consistently unclear. Regarding sclerotherapy, there are anecdotal reports of its application in patients with acutely bleeding hemorrhoids.

For these reasons, there is not enough quality data to make any recommendation regarding the application of office-based procedures to manage complicated hemorrhoids.

- **Surgical treatment considerations**: In patients with complicated hemorrhoids, what are the indications for surgical treatment and what is the appropriate timing for surgery? In patients with thrombosed hemorrhoids, we suggest basing the decision between non-operative management and early surgical excision on local expertise and patient's preference (weak recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 2C). In patients with thrombosed hemorrhoids, we suggest against the use of incision and drainage of the thrombus (weak recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 2C).

No recommendation can be made regarding the role of surgery in patients with bleeding hemorrhoids, based on the available literature.

In this study, 738 patients were screened between August 2011 and November 2013, and 438 patients were excluded because of non-consent, alternative surgeries, hemorrhoidal management procedures, or other reasons. The average follow-up time in this study was 63.5 months (range, 48–75 months) in the PSH group and 60 months (range, 48–75 months) in the CSH group. Baseline characteristics are summarized in Table 1, showing that the two groups were well matched in age, sex, duration of disease (rounded to the half year), degree of severity of the hemorrhoids, and preoperative Jorge-Wexner incontinence score.

- **Table 1: Demographic and clinical features of patients undergoing either PSH or CSH**

- **Figure 1: Participant enrollment and follow-up (CONSORT flow diagram)**

- **Early postoperative outcomes in patients receiving PSH and CSH**: The median operative time was comparable between the groups (20 min [range, 8–60 min] in the PSH group vs 20 min [range, 5–60 min] in the CSH group; p = 0.705). Of the total patients in each study arm, the incidence of intraoperative bleeding from the staple line requiring hemostatic sutures was significantly lower in the PSH group (12% [18/150]) compared with the CSH group (75% [112/150]; p = 0.001). There was a slight but significant difference in estimated blood loss between the two groups (PSH group, 10 mL [range, 5–25 mL] vs 20 mL [range, 5–100 mL]; p = 0.001). The length of the resected rectal tissues was 4.00 cm (range, 3.00–5.50 cm) in the PSH group and 3.25 cm in the CSH group.

### Conservative and surgical treatment of haemorrhoids [^114M5hbA]. Nature Reviews Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2013). Low credibility.

The management of haemorrhoids has evolved rapidly during the past few decades. Several new treatments have been proposed with the aim of reducing patients' postoperative pain, time to return to normal life, risk of early and late complications, and recurrence rate. Although conservative treatment based on dietary and lifestyle changes can help the majority of patients, and rubber band ligation and phlebotonic drugs can effectively treat grade I and II haemorrhoids, surgery is required for the most advanced stages. Milligan-Morgan haemorrhoidectomy is considered to be the gold-standard approach for grade IV haemorrhoids.

An increasing number of minimally invasive treatment options, including mucopexy with or without mucosal resection and haemorrhoid artery ligation, have now been proposed for the management of grade III haemorrhoids. These approaches aim to correct the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms involved in the aetiology of haemorrhoids. An increased risk of recurrence is the price to pay for these minimally invasive and less painful treatments; however, the sparing of the sensitive anoderm and a rapid return to normal life without pain are greatly appreciated by patients. An algorithm for the management of haemorrhoids using evidence-based medicine is also presented here.

### Pathophysiology of internal hemorrhoids [^111m2SrT]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2019). Low credibility.

One major goal of the conservative treatment of hemorrhoids is to normalize stool consistency; both diarrhea and constipation are clinically potent causes and triggering factors of symptoms in hemorrhoidal disease, and their management is as invaluable as the treatment of hemorrhoids per se. The remaining elements of conservative therapy, such as avoiding straining during defecation, have been proven to limit the prolapse of hemorrhoids.

Increased anal pressure is very important in the pathophysiology of hemorrhoids and is a frequent clinical sign, manifested as anal spasm on rectal examination. This increased anal pressure is the rationale for using topical nitroglycerine 0.4% ointment to treat pain due to internal hemorrhoids. Intra-anal pressure typically returns to normal after hemorrhoidectomy.

The principal mode of action of flavonoids, especially the micronized ones that are easily absorbed and act quickly, is by increasing the impaired vascular tone. Moreover, they are thought to relieve congestion inside sinusoids by reducing venous capacity and decreasing capillary permeability, which facilitates lymphatic drainage and exerts anti-inflammatory effects. Recent clinical trials have proven the effectiveness of treatment with flavonoids in both chronic and acute hemorrhoidal disease. In chronic disease, conservative therapy with micronized purified flavonoid fraction was found to be beneficial in relieving hemorrhoidal symptoms and in preventing disease relapse in the majority of patients. In acute hemorrhoidal disease, a mixture of flavonoids has demonstrated efficacy in clinical use.

### Global treatment of haemorrhoids-a worldwide snapshot audit conducted by the International Society of University Colon and Rectal Surgeons [^115mzWzi]. Colorectal Disease (2024). Low credibility.

There is no universally accepted treatment consensus for haemorrhoids; thus, management has been individualized across the globe. This study was conducted to assess a global perspective on how surgeons manage haemorrhoids.

- **Methods**: The research panel of the International Society of University Colon and Rectal Surgeons (ISUCRS) developed a voluntary and anonymous questionnaire evaluating surgeons' experience, volume, and treatment approaches to haemorrhoids. The 44 multiple-choice questionnaire was available for one month via the ISUCRS email database and the social media platforms Viber and WhatsApp.

- **Results**: The survey was completed by 1005 surgeons from 103 countries; 931 (92.6%) were in active practice, 819 (81.5%) were aged between 30 and 60 years, and 822 (81.8%) were male. Detailed patient history (92.9%), perineal inspection (91.2%), and digital rectal examination (91.1%) were the most common assessment methods. For internal haemorrhoids, 924 (91.9%) of participants graded them I-IV, with the degree of haemorrhoids being the most important factor considered in determining the treatment approach (76.3%).

- **Treatment**: The most common nonprocedural/conservative treatment consisted of increased daily fibre intake (86.9%), increased water intake (82.7%), and normalization of bowel habits/toilet training (74.4%). Conservative treatment was the first-line treatment for symptomatic first (92.5%), second (72.4%), and third (47.3%) degree haemorrhoids; however, surgery was the first-line treatment for symptomatic fourth-degree haemorrhoids (77.6%). Rubber band ligation was the second-line treatment for symptomatic haemorrhoids.

### Anorectal emergencies: WSES-AAST guidelines [^112zEGJi]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2021). High credibility.

Focusing on thrombosed hemorrhoids, studies comparing non-operative management (NOM) and surgery have led to contrasting results. A prospective study from Allan et al. compared the outcome of urgent hemorrhoidectomy with conservative treatment for prolapsed thrombosed internal hemorrhoids and found that conservative treatment was associated with shorter patient stay and less anal sphincter damage compared with operative treatment. On the other hand, other studies suggest that surgery may be superior to conservative management, but the correct duration of NOM and the timing for surgery are not known, as confirmed by the literature research performed by Chan et al. Patients treated conservatively will eventually have a resolution of symptoms, but recurrence rates are high and there is some evidence that surgical excision may result in more rapid symptom resolution, lower incidence of recurrence, and longer remission intervals.

Simple incision of thrombosed hemorrhoids with clot removal used to be a popular procedure but has been abandoned by most specialists because of persistent bleeding and the significantly higher recurrence rates seen. A randomized prospective study by Cavcić et al. divided 150 patients with acutely thrombosed hemorrhoids into three different arms: topical application of 0.2% nitroglycerin, incision and evacuation of thrombus, and excision of the hemorrhoid; the analysis of pain scores on day 4 after treatment showed that thrombus evacuation provided the worst results. Another study from Greenspoon et al. retrospectively reviewed 231 patients who underwent…

### Hemorrhoidal disease: A review [^112MKBGH]. JAMA (2025). Low credibility.

Hemorrhoidal disease, a pathology of the tissue lining of the anal canal, affects approximately 10 million individuals in the U.S. It may impair the quality of life due to bleeding, pain, anal irritation, and tissue prolapse.

- **Observations**: Hemorrhoids are classified as internal, external, or mixed (concurrent internal and external hemorrhoidal disease). Internal hemorrhoids originate above the dentate line, the boundary between the upper and lower anal canal, and may cause rectal bleeding, discomfort, and tissue prolapse from the anal canal. Internal hemorrhoid prolapse is classified as grade I (into the anal canal), grade II (beyond the anus with spontaneous reduction), grade III (requiring manual reduction), and grade IV (irreducible). External hemorrhoids, arising below the dentate line, cause rectal pain when engorged or thrombosed.

- **Initial treatment**: The primary approach involves increasing the intake of dietary fiber and water and avoiding straining during defecation. Phlebotonics (e.g. flavonoids, which are thought to improve venous tone) reduce bleeding, rectal pain, and swelling, although symptom recurrence reaches 80% within 3 to 6 months after treatment cessation. If dietary modification and phlebotonics are ineffective, grade I to grade III internal hemorrhoidal disease can be treated with office-based interventions such as rubber band ligation. This technique, which places a band around the base of hemorrhoid tissue during anoscopy to restrict blood flow, resolves symptoms in 89% of patients; however, repeated banding is needed in up to 20% of cases. Sclerotherapy induces fibrosis and serves as another intervention for hemorrhoidal disease.

### Partial stapled hemorrhoidopexy versus circumferential stapled hemorrhoidopexy for grade III to IV prolapsing hemorrhoids: A randomized, noninferiority trial [^115XGDJo]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2019). Low credibility.

The circumferential stapled hemorrhoidopexy (CSH) technique was first introduced for the management of symptomatic hemorrhoids by Longo in 1998. Our previous systematic review and meta-analysis reported that the CSH technique is an effective procedure for reducing the principal hemorrhoidal symptoms, although there is a reported higher rate of symptomatic prolapse over time compared with conventional hemorrhoidectomy.

Although CSH procedures are associated with less postoperative pain compared with the conventional hemorrhoidectomy, a small but significant number of patients experience unrelenting discomfort. It is postulated that excessive fibrosis around the staples may be an important cause of persistent proctalgia. Functional issues, including new-onset fecal urgency and difficulty in defecation, are probably a result of the inflammatory response to staple deployment. In some cases, a fixed fibrotic element leads to significant postoperative anorectal stenosis. Rarely, a rectovaginal fistula may develop secondary to the occurrence of hematoma within the rectovaginal septum.

### Benign anorectal disease: Hemorrhoids, fissures, and fistulas [^114JGtXN]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2019). Low credibility.

Hemorrhoids are prevalent in 4–8% of the self-reported U.S. population, with about one-third seeking treatment. In the UK, epidemiological data suggest a prevalence of 13–36% in the general population, likely an overestimate. Screening colonoscopy data indicate that approximately 38% of the population has hemorrhoids, though only 44% of these individuals reported symptoms. The primary risk factors are middle age (45–65 years) and obesity.

Hemorrhoidal columns are anatomical clusters of vascular and connective tissue, smooth muscle, and epithelium situated in the left lateral, right anterior, and right posterior anal canal, contributing to continence. These columns become pathological when engorged, leading to symptoms. Internal hemorrhoids, located proximal to the dentate line and covered by columnar epithelium, have visceral innervation. Clinical classification occurs upon symptom manifestation: Grade 1 hemorrhoids do not prolapse; Grade 2 prolapse with straining; Grade 3 require manual reduction; Grade 4 are irreducible. External hemorrhoids, found in the perianal subcutaneous venous plexuses distal to the dentate line, have somatic innervation and are covered by squamous epithelium. Pathology arises when these venous plexuses rupture, creating a painful subcutaneous hematoma or "thrombosed external hemorrhoid".

Originally, hemorrhoids were thought to be caused by portal hypertension, but the most popular modern theory suggests other etiological factors.

### Randomized controlled trial comparing rubber band ligation with stapled haemorrhoidopexy for Grade II circumferential haemorrhoids: Long-term results [^113wULup]. Colorectal Disease (2010). High credibility.

An improved understanding of the pathophysiology of haemorrhoids has resulted in the introduction of new surgical techniques including stapled haemorrhoidopexy (SH). This randomized controlled trial compared the long-term effectiveness of SH with rubber band ligation (RBL) in the treatment of Grade II circumferential symptomatic haemorrhoids.

A consecutive cohort of patients was randomly allocated to either SH or RBL. Data on haemorrhoidal symptoms, Cleveland continence scores, sphincter assessment, SF-36, EQ-5D, HAD score, and prior treatment history were assessed at enrollment and reassessed by long-term postal questionnaire. The details were analyzed using SPSS 12.0 from Microsoft Access.

Sixty patients were allocated by computer block randomization. Both groups were balanced for age, sex, and symptoms. Recurrence favored SH [3 vs. 11; OR 0.18, 95% CI (0.03 to 0.86), P = 0.028] at 1 year and, at a mean of 40.67 (31–47) months [4 vs. 12; OR 0.23, 95% CI (0.05, 0.95); P = 0.039]. SH patients experienced prolonged pain [Median (IQR) = 7 (5, 7) vs. 3 (1, 7), P = 0.008] and took longer to return to work [6 (3, 7) vs. 3 (1, 6) days, P = 0.018]. There was no significant difference in quality of life.

Stapled haemorrhoidopexy achieved better disease control at 1 year without any major complication. This was sustained in the long term. Further studies with greater patient numbers are needed to confirm this study.

### Comparison of rubber band ligation and hemorrhoidectomy in patients with symptomatic hemorrhoids grade III: A multicenter, open-label, randomized controlled noninferiority trial [^113Ns9UZ]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2025). High credibility.

Before randomization, all patients received conservative treatments, including dietary counseling, stool hygiene, toilet habits, fiber supplementation, and local therapies such as vasoconstrictors, prescribed at the surgeon's discretion per the pragmatic study design.

- **Rubber band ligation**: The details of the RBL procedure are outlined in the study protocol. In brief, up to two RBL sessions were permitted if symptoms persisted after the initial procedure, allowing flexibility in addressing ongoing symptoms, consistent with standard clinical practice. Given that RBL treatment often entails repeated sessions for grade III hemorrhoids, this study hypothesized that repeated RBL (up to two sessions) would be noninferior to hemorrhoidectomy regarding HR-QoL and recurrence rates while being more cost-effective.

- **Hemorrhoidectomy**: Hemorrhoidectomy was performed using either the open technique or the closed technique, both of which are aimed at excising hemorrhoidal cushions using electrocautery. A more detailed description of both techniques can be found in the published study protocol.

- **Data collection**: Clinical data were collected at baseline, intervention, and six-week follow-up, with some assessments conducted by phone due to COVID-19. Data included demographics, medical history, Rome IV criteria for chronic constipation, pelvic floor physiotherapy, symptom duration, and previous treatments. Procedural data covered intervention details and complications. The postoperative period covered the first 90 days after treatment, recording complications such as bleeding requiring…

### Long-term outcome of rubber band ligation for symptomatic primary and recurrent internal hemorrhoids [^11134Jwd]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2004). Low credibility.

Rubber band ligation therapy for symptomatic hemorrhoidal disease has been used for many years and is a well-accepted treatment modality; however, information on long-term outcomes is limited. Our goals were to determine the safety and long-term efficacy of this treatment.

A retrospective chart review of patients undergoing rubber band ligatures for symptomatic internal hemorrhoids in a single practice was conducted. Information documented included presenting symptoms, number of bands applied, response to therapy, complications encountered, length of follow-up, interval to reSymptoms when applicable, and subsequent therapy. Supplemental information was obtained from telephone follow-up. Outcomes were categorized as success or failure. Success was defined as permanent relief of symptoms for the follow-up period or marked improvement in symptomatology with rare manifestation of bleeding (≥ 100 days). Failure was defined as modest improvement (decreased but not complete relief of symptoms) or no improvement in symptoms.

A total of 805 patients underwent 2,114 rubber band ligatures. The most common presenting symptoms were bleeding in 731 patients (90.8 percent) and prolapsing in 382 patients (47.5 percent). The median number of bands placed was two (range, 1–17). The median time between bandings was 4.7 weeks (range, 1.1–35.6 weeks). The median follow-up time was 1,204 days (range, 14–9,571 days). Excluding 104 patients lost to follow-up (those who never returned after initial treatment), success was obtained in 70 percent of cases.

### Effectiveness of endoscopic submucosal dissection in the management of internal hemorrhoids: a retrospective cohort study [^112ayvuV]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Improvement in internal hemorrhoids is frequently observed after endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) for rectal intraepithelial neoplasia. This study investigated the effectiveness of rectal ESD in the management of internal hemorrhoids.

- **Objectives**: Twenty-three patients underwent ESD for tumors adjacent to the dentate line, which were associated with internal hemorrhoids.

- **Design**: A single-arm, retrospective multi-center study.

- **Methods**: The focal improvement (at the scarring area after ESD) and complete improvement rates of hemorrhoids at follow-up colonoscopies were evaluated.

- **Results**: Most patients (87%) had mild hemorrhoids. The focal and complete improvement rates of hemorrhoids were 83% and 48%, respectively. Complete improvement rates were 75% (3/4), 42% (5/12), and 43% (3/7) for tumors involving ⩾1/2, between 1/4 and 1/2, and < 1/4 of the circumference at the dentate line, respectively. No recurrence was observed after initial improvement, with a median observation period of 35 months.

- **Conclusion**: ESD may be an effective treatment for internal hemorrhoids.

### Comparison of rubber band ligation and hemorrhoidectomy in patients with symptomatic hemorrhoids grade III: A multicenter, open-label, randomized controlled noninferiority trial [^116wBVUc]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2025). High credibility.

The optimal management strategy for grade III hemorrhoids remains a subject of ongoing debate. Hemorrhoidectomy is the criterion standard, but rubber band ligation offers a less invasive outpatient alternative. Treatment variability persists due to a lack of consensus on the preferred strategy.

- **Objective**: To directly compare the effectiveness of rubber band ligation and hemorrhoidectomy in the treatment of grade III hemorrhoids.

- **Design**: Open-label, parallel-group, randomized controlled noninferiority trial.

- **Settings**: Multicenter study across 10 Dutch hospitals from October 2019 to September 2022.

- **Patients**: Patients (aged 18 years or older) with symptomatic grade III (Goligher) hemorrhoids were included in this study. Exclusion criteria included prior rectal/anal surgery, more than one rubber band ligation/injection within the preceding three years, rectal radiation, preexisting sphincter injury, IBD, medical unfitness for surgery (ASA higher than 3), pregnancy, or hypercoagulability disorders.

- **Interventions**: Randomized 1:1 to rubber band ligation or hemorrhoidectomy, with up to two banding sessions allowed.

- **Main outcome measures**: Primary outcomes included 12-month health-related quality of life and recurrence rate. Secondary outcomes included complications, pain, work resumption, and patient-reported outcome measures.

- **Results**: Eighty-seven patients were randomly assigned (47 rubber band ligation vs 40 hemorrhoidectomy). Rubber band ligation was not noninferior to hemorrhoidectomy in quality-adjusted life years (–0.045; 95% CI, –0.087 to –0.004). Recurrence rates were evaluated at the end of the study period.
