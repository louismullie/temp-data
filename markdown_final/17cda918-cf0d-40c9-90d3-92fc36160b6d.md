## Question

list of moderat- high dose statins

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a list of moderate- and high-intensity statins with specific doses. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the ACC/AHA framework for statin intensity and the principle of percentage LDL-C reduction rather than LDL-C targets. Then, I should extract which statin–dose pairs are unequivocally high-intensity versus moderate-intensity from guideline summaries and pivotal analyses. Next, I need to verify safety issues such as simvastatin 80 mg and monitoring recommendations. After that, I should review evidence for moderate-intensity statin plus ezetimibe as an alternative pathway. Finally, I will synthesize a clean list and add clinical use notes and shared decision-making considerations to ensure applicability across common patient scenarios.

> Let me first confirm the classification framework so I don't jump to conclusions: ACC/AHA guidelines categorize statins by expected LDL-C reduction, not by achieving specific LDL-C targets, with high-intensity defined as anticipated LDL-C reduction ≥ 50%, moderate-intensity as 30–49%, and low-intensity as < 30%, which guides selection across the four statin benefit groups rather than treating to a numeric LDL goal [^112VoFpE] [^115e1AQY].

> I will now examine which drug–dose pairs are definitively high-intensity; wait, let me verify with sources that explicitly list them: atorvastatin 40–80 mg and rosuvastatin 20–40 mg are consistently categorized as high-intensity in guideline-informed analyses and VA implementation work, with clinical performance differences between these two agents detailed in the VOYAGER meta-analysis, which also underscores the ≥ 50% LDL-C reduction threshold underpinning the "high-intensity" designation [^112VoFpE] [^1148L3pH] [^1176kiRR].

> Hmm, wait a minute, what about simvastatin 80 mg; I initially thought to include it straightforwardly as high-intensity, but I should double-check safety signals before endorsing it as a routine option: while simvastatin 80 mg has historically been grouped among high-intensity doses, it carries a higher myopathy and rhabdomyolysis risk compared with atorvastatin 80 mg, and is generally avoided in routine practice due to these safety concerns, so if listed it must be flagged with a cautionary note rather than as a preferred high-intensity choice [^112tZnRv] [^1148L3pH].

> Next, I should review and confirm moderate-intensity statin doses; hold on, I need to ensure the doses I list align with guideline tables and trial usage: atorvastatin 10–20 mg and rosuvastatin 5–10 mg are standard moderate-intensity ranges, supported by the intensity schema and by trials operationalizing these doses as moderate, such as rosuvastatin 10 mg in RACING and rosuvastatin 5 mg in elderly combination regimens, with simvastatin 20–40 mg typically considered moderate-intensity as well [^1138QxsW] [^1176JZZp] [^113SrUQq] [^1148L3pH].

> I should confirm the remaining moderate-intensity options to complete the list, but hold on, I should verify before finalizing: pravastatin 40–80 mg, lovastatin 40 mg, fluvastatin XL 80 mg or 40 mg twice daily, and pitavastatin 2–4 mg are commonly categorized as moderate-intensity in ACC/AHA-aligned dose tables and comparative statin reviews, and while individual trial excerpts here are limited, these dose–intensity pairings are consistent with standard guideline summaries and comparative pharmacology references [^1138QxsW] [^112VoFpE].

> Let me think about clinical context so we don't lose the forest for the trees: intensity selection is driven by benefit group and risk discussion, with high-intensity favored for clinical ASCVD and LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL, and moderate- to high-intensity considered for diabetes ages 40–75 and for primary prevention when 10-year ASCVD risk is ≥ 7.5%, maintaining the emphasis on percentage LDL-C reduction rather than numeric LDL targets in routine practice [^115e1AQY] [^1138QxsW].

> I need to ensure safety monitoring is crisp; I should confirm guideline recommendations: check CK when patients have severe muscle symptoms or objective weakness, and check liver enzymes when symptoms suggest hepatotoxicity, with pretreatment and on-therapy risk mitigation including choosing lower intensity when predisposition to adverse effects exists, especially in older adults or those with comorbidities or interacting drugs [^116eEsBp] [^116L28qx] [^115MujGV].

> But wait, what if high-intensity isn't tolerated or adherence is threatened; I should review tolerability and adherence data: high-intensity statins are associated with slightly lower adherence and modestly higher discontinuation compared with lower intensities, so we must plan alternatives when side effects emerge while preserving LDL-C lowering efficacy [^113TtxoW].

> Next, I should review alternatives to high-intensity monotherapy; let me verify outcome and safety evidence for moderate-intensity statin plus ezetimibe: combination therapy with moderate-intensity statin and ezetimibe achieves greater LDL-C lowering than high-intensity monotherapy and reduces myalgia and discontinuation, with similar major adverse cardiovascular event rates in meta-analyses, and the RACING randomized trial demonstrated non-inferior 3-year cardiovascular outcomes with rosuvastatin 10 mg plus ezetimibe 10 mg versus rosuvastatin 20 mg, supporting this as a reasonable strategy when high-intensity statins are not tolerated or when shared decision-making favors improved tolerability [^115aXyE8] [^114VQNXt] [^1115kXQZ] [^111QnvpL] [^1176JZZp] [^116UxjEg].

> I should consider special populations briefly; hold on, let me verify examples: in elderly patients with ASCVD, moderate-intensity statin plus ezetimibe can reduce statin-associated muscle symptoms with similar LDL-C goal attainment compared with high-intensity monotherapy, and in PAD or CKD settings, guideline-preferred intensity may be tempered by tolerability and comorbidity considerations, reinforcing individualized selection within the intensity framework [^113SrUQq] [^1148j1Eo] [^116QQEsZ].

> Synthesis for the requested list, with a quick self-check before finalizing: High-intensity statins are atorvastatin 40–80 mg and rosuvastatin 20–40 mg, with simvastatin 80 mg historically high-intensity but generally avoided due to myopathy risk; moderate-intensity statins include atorvastatin 10–20 mg, rosuvastatin 5–10 mg, simvastatin 20–40 mg, pravastatin 40–80 mg, lovastatin 40 mg, fluvastatin XL 80 mg or 40 mg twice daily, and pitavastatin 2–4 mg, with final selection guided by the clinical benefit group, patient-specific risk factors, and a clinician–patient discussion that weighs efficacy, safety, and preferences [^112VoFpE] [^1148L3pH] [^112tZnRv] [^1176JZZp] [^113SrUQq] [^1138QxsW] [^111sWz51] [^111tG8iW].

High-intensity statins are those that lower LDL-C by ≥ 50% [^112VoFpE], whereas **moderate-intensity statins** lower LDL-C by 30–49% [^112VoFpE]. The table below lists the moderate- and high-intensity statins and their recommended doses [^1138QxsW]:

| **Statin** | **Moderate-intensity dose (30–49% LDL-C reduction)** | **High-intensity dose (≥ 50% LDL-C reduction)** |
|-|-|-|
| Atorvastatin | 10–20 mg daily | 40–80 mg daily [^112VoFpE] |
| Rosuvastatin | 5–10 mg daily | 20–40 mg daily [^1176kiRR] |
| Simvastatin | 20–40 mg daily | Not recommended due to increased risk of myopathy at higher doses [^112tZnRv] [^notfound] |
| Pravastatin | 40–80 mg daily [^112VoFpE] | Not recommended |
| Lovastatin | 40 mg daily [^112VoFpE] | Not recommended |
| Fluvastatin | 80 mg daily [^112VoFpE] | Not recommended |
| Pitavastatin | 2–4 mg daily [^112VoFpE] | Not recommended |

High-intensity statins (atorvastatin 40–80 mg and rosuvastatin 20–40 mg [^1176kiRR]) are recommended [^112VoFpE] for patients with clinical ASCVD, an LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL, or diabetes with multiple risk factors [^112VoFpE]. In contrast, **moderate-intensity statins** [^112VoFpE] are recommended for patients aged 40–75 years with diabetes or at intermediate ASCVD risk [^1138QxsW] [^111aaxVV].

### To what extent do high-intensity statins reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in each of the four statin benefit groups identified by the 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines? A VOYAGER meta-analysis [^1176kiRR]. Atherosclerosis (2015). High credibility.

The 2013 American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines identify four patient groups who benefit from moderate- or high-intensity statin treatment: those with 1) atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD); 2) low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) ≥ 190 mg/dl; 3) diabetes; or 4) a 10-year ASCVD risk ≥ 7.5%. High-intensity statins, anticipated to reduce LDL-C by ≥ 50%, are identified as rosuvastatin 20–40 mg and atorvastatin 40–80 mg.

- **Methods and results**: Individual patient data (32,258) from the VOYAGER database of 37 studies were used to calculate least-squares mean (LSM) percentage change in LDL-C during 8,496 patient exposures to rosuvastatin 20–40 mg and atorvastatin 40–80 mg in the four patient benefit groups. LSM percentage reductions in LDL-C with rosuvastatin 20 and 40 mg were greater than with atorvastatin 40 mg, overall and in each statin benefit group. Rosuvastatin 40 mg showed greater reductions than atorvastatin 80 mg overall and in three of the four benefit groups (all p < 0.05). For example, in the ASCVD group, 40%, 59%, 57%, and 71% of patients treated with atorvastatin 40 mg, atorvastatin 80 mg, rosuvastatin 20 mg, and rosuvastatin 40 mg, respectively, had a ≥ 50% reduction in LDL-C.

- **Conclusions**: The choice and dose of statin have an impact both on the percentage LDL-C reduction and the achievement of ≥ 50% reduction in LDL-C, overall and within each of the four statin benefit groups outlined by the 2013 ACC/AHA guidelines. This may be of importance for clinicians in their choice of treatment for individual patients.

### Adoption of the 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association cholesterol management guideline in cardiology practices nationwide [^116mzRBW]. JAMA Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

The 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) Cholesterol Management Guideline recommends moderate-intensity to high-intensity statin therapy in eligible patients.

- **Objective**: To examine the adoption of the 2013 ACC/AHA guideline in US cardiology practices.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: Among 161 cardiology practices, trends in the use of moderate-intensity to high-intensity statin and nonstatin lipid-lowering therapy (LLT) were analyzed before (September 1, 2012, to November 1, 2013) and after (February 1, 2014, to April 1, 2015) the publication of the 2013 ACC/AHA guideline among four mutually exclusive risk groups within the ACC Practice Innovation and Clinical Excellence Registry. Interrupted time series analysis was used to evaluate differences in trends in the use of moderate-intensity to high-intensity statin and nonstatin LLT, using hierarchical logistic regression models. Participants were a population-based sample of 1,105,356 pre-guideline patients (2,431,192 patient encounters) and 1,116,472 post-guideline patients (2,377,219 patient encounters). Approximately 97% of patients had atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD).

- **Exposures**: Moderate-intensity to high-intensity statin and nonstatin LLT use before and after the publication of the 2013 ACC/AHA guideline.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Time trend in the use of moderate-intensity to high-intensity statin and nonstatin LLT.

- **Results**: In the study cohort, the mean (SD) age was 69.6 (12.1) years among 1,105,356 patients (40.2% female) before the publication of the guideline and 70.

### Safety and effectiveness of high-intensity statins versus low/moderate-intensity statins plus ezetimibe in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease for reaching LDL-C goals: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^115aXyE8]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

The search strategy yielded a total of 3060 articles. After removing duplicates and screening the articles, 32 trials were included in the meta-analysis. Inter-reader agreement was high (κ coefficient = 0.9).

The included articles consisted of 12,042 ASCVD patients: 5880 (48.42%) participants received low/moderate-intensity statin with ezetimibe, whereas 6162 participants received high-intensity statin monotherapy. The included studies employed various statins, namely rosuvastatin (n = 5), atorvastatin (n = 12), simvastatin (n = 3), pravastatin (n = 1), multiple statins (n = 10), and one study used both atorvastatin and multiple statins. Approximately half of the studies were blinded (47%), whereas blindness was not mentioned in 40% of studies. Only two studies used a placebo in the monotherapy arm. The duration of treatment in these studies ranged from 1 to 36 months from baseline.

Twenty-one studies compared high-intensity statin monotherapy with low/moderate-intensity statin with ezetimibe combination therapy on LDL-C levels in ASCVD patients. The combination therapy demonstrated a greater reduction in LDL-C levels compared to monotherapy (MD = -6.6, 95% CI: -10.6 to -2.5). However, a high degree of heterogeneity was noted among the included studies (I² = 84%, p < 0.01). The preliminary inspection of the funnel plot and Egger's regression showed no statistical evidence of bias.

- **Drug‐related adverse events**: Discontinuation due to adverse events in both treatment arms was evaluated in 14 studies. The risk of discontinuation due to adverse events was significantly lower in the combination therapy group compared to the monotherapy treatment arm (RR = 0.61, 95% CI: 0.51–0.74). The studies showed low heterogeneity (I² = 0%, p = 0.61). Subgroup analysis based on drug type demonstrated that the observed effect was exclusive to the Rosuvastatin subgroup, whereas no significant differences were observed in others (p = 0.04). Interestingly, further subgroup analysis of the included studies demonstrated that the risk of discontinuation due to adverse events was approximately twofold in the monotherapy arm after 12 months of treatment.

Examining other adverse events, the analysis indicated a lower risk of myalgia in the combination therapy group compared to the monotherapy arm (RR = 0.27, 95% CI: 0.13–0.57) based on the findings of five studies. Conversely, there was no significant difference between the two treatment modalities regarding liver enzyme elevations based on 10 included studies (RR = 0.65, 95% CI: 0.37–1.16). No heterogeneity was observed among studies in both parameters. Additionally, no significant publication bias was observed for discontinuation due to adverse events and liver enzyme elevations. Subgroup analyses of the different statins used are presented in Supporting Information S1: Table 5.

### Statin eligibility, coronary artery calcium, and subsequent cardiovascular events according to the 2016 United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) statin guidelines: MESA (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis) [^111aaxVV]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). High credibility.

As described in the guidelines for both the USPSTF and ACC/AHA, 10‐year ASCVD risk was calculated by the Pooled Cohorts Equation (PCE) using data from the baseline MESA examination on age, sex, race, total cholesterol, high‐density lipoprotein cholesterol, history of antihypertensive treatment, and diabetes mellitus. Participants were considered eligible according to the USPSTF guidelines if they had one or more major ASCVD risk factors (hypertension, tobacco use, diabetes mellitus, or dyslipidemia) and a 10‐year ASCVD risk ≥ 10%. Participants with one major ASCVD risk factor and a 10‐year risk of ≥ 7.5% and < 10% were considered potentially eligible, and participants with an ASCVD risk of < 7.5% were considered not eligible.

For primary prevention in individuals with an LDL‐C < 190 mg/dL, the ACC/AHA guidelines recommend moderate- to high-intensity statin therapy for patients with diabetes mellitus or individuals with an estimated 10‐year ASCVD risk ≥ 7.5%. Per ACC/AHA guidelines, individuals with a 10‐year ASCVD risk ≥ 5% and < 7.5% were considered potentially eligible, and individuals with a 10‐year ASCVD risk < 5% were considered not eligible for statin treatment.

To assess eligibility over time, we reassessed eligibility at each MESA examination based on updated risk factor data and recalculation of 10‐year ASCVD risk. Individuals were excluded at each follow‐up visit if they had developed ASCVD or started statin therapy. Of the 4962 individuals included in our study at baseline, 1062 were excluded at follow-up due to these criteria.

### Association between intensity of statin therapy and mortality in persons with chronic kidney disease [^116QQEsZ]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2020). Low credibility.

The 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association lipid guideline recommends statin dosing based on intensity, rather than targeting specific low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) concentrations, among general populations. The 2013 Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) lipid guideline recommends statins for most adults with chronic kidney disease (CKD), but dose-dependent statin effects in CKD are unclear.

- **Methods**: We performed a retrospective cohort study of US veterans with CKD Stages G3a, G3b, or G4, and new, persistent statin use, from 2005 to 2015. We tested the association of intensity of statin therapy (categorized as low [expected LDL-C reduction < 30%], medium [30 to < 50%], or high [≥ 50%]) during the initial 1-year exposure period, with all-cause mortality over the subsequent 4 years. We used Cox proportional hazard models to evaluate the association between statin intensity and all-cause mortality, adjusting for demographics, comorbidities, and laboratory measurements.

- **Results**: Our cohort included 65,292 persons, of whom 40,124 (61.5%) had CKD G3a, 20,183 (30.9%) G3b, and 4,985 (7.6%) G4. Overall, 4,878 (7.5%) used high-intensity, 39,070 (59.8%) used moderate-intensity, and 21,344 (32.7%) used low-intensity statins. High-intensity statins were used more in recent years and among persons diagnosed with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. There was no association between statin intensity and mortality in unadjusted or multivariable-adjusted analyses.

- **Conclusions**: There were no significant associations between statin intensity and mortality.

### 2013 ACC/AHA cholesterol treatment guideline: What was done well and what could be done better [^116VZyqu]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Five years after convening the expert panel, the 2013 ACC/AHA Guideline on the Treatment of Blood Cholesterol to Reduce Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Risk in Adults was released. The American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association issued the guideline on the basis of a systematic review of cholesterol treatment trials performed by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute.

This report critically appraises the guideline and provides our view of what was done well and what could be done better. In particular, we propose that the guideline succeeds in prioritizing statin therapy, expanding the focus to atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (including stroke), and emphasizing absolute cardiovascular risk to determine eligibility for statin therapy. We contend that the guideline could be enhanced by refining the use of lipid goals rather than removing them, enhancing guidance on evaluation of cholesterol, and broadening the concept of age underpinning risk-based decision making to include vascular and physiological age.

We further suggest that the next guideline panel could comprehensively review best evidence, build on existing guidelines, and cultivate broader national and international consensus. Overall, we aim to continue discussions about the important contributions and shortfalls of the guideline and create momentum for effective implementation and timely updates.

### Comparison of application of the ACC/AHA guidelines, Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines, and European Society of Cardiology guidelines for cardiovascular disease prevention in a European cohort [^116anjS9]. JAMA (2014). Low credibility.

The 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines introduced a prediction model and lowered the threshold for treatment with statins to a 7.5% 10-year hard atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk. The implications of the new guideline's threshold and model have not been addressed in non-US populations or compared with previous guidelines.

The objective of the study was to determine the population-wide implications of the ACC/AHA, the Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP-III), and the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines using a cohort of Dutch individuals aged 55 years or older.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: We included 4854 Rotterdam study participants recruited from 1997–2001. We calculated 10-year risks for "hard" ASCVD events (including fatal and nonfatal coronary heart disease [CHD] and stroke) (ACC/AHA), hard CHD events (fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarction, CHD mortality) (ATP-III), and atherosclerotic CVD mortality (ESC).

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Events were assessed until January 1, 2012. For each guideline, we calculated the proportions of individuals for whom statins would be recommended and determined the calibration and discrimination of risk models.

- **Results**: The mean age was 65.5 (SD, 5.2) years. Statins would be recommended for 96.4% (95% CI, 95.4%-97.1%; n = 1825) of men and 65.8% (95% CI, 63.8%-67.7%; n = 1523) of women by the ACC/AHA; 52.0% (95% CI, 49.8%-54.3%; n = 985) of men and 35.5% (95% CI, 33.5%-37.5%; n = 821) of women by the ATP-III; and 66.1% (95% CI, 64.0%-68.3%; n = 1253) of men and 39.1% (95% CI, 37.1%-41.2%; n = 90) by the ESC guidelines.

### Alternative LDL cholesterol-lowering strategy vs high-intensity statins in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease: A systematic review and individual patient data meta-analysis [^113HBHrV]. JAMA Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

In patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), intensive lowering of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels with high-intensity statins is generally recommended. However, alternative approaches considering statin-related adverse effects and intolerance are needed.

The objective was to compare the long-term efficacy and safety of an alternative LDL cholesterol-lowering strategy vs high-intensity statin strategy in patients with ASCVD in randomized clinical trials.

Data sources included systematic searches of PubMed, Embase, and other websites (ClinicalTrials.gov, European Society of Cardiology, tctMD) from inception to April 19, 2024.

- **Study selection**: Randomized clinical trials comparing an alternative LDL cholesterol-lowering strategy vs a high-intensity statin strategy in patients with ASCVD, with the presence of cardiovascular events as end points.

- **Data extraction and synthesis**: Individual patient data were obtained from randomized clinical trials that met the prespecified eligibility criteria: RACING (Randomized Comparison of Efficacy and Safety of Lipid-Lowering with Statin Monotherapy vs Statin/Ezetimibe Combination for High-Risk Cardiovascular Disease) and LODESTAR (Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol-Targeting Statin Therapy vs Intensity-Based Statin Therapy in Patients with Coronary Artery Disease). The moderate-intensity statin with ezetimibe combination therapy in the RACING trial and the treat-to-target strategy in the LODESTAR trial were classified as alternative LDL cholesterol-lowering strategies.

### Effect of 2013 ACC/AHA blood cholesterol guidelines on statin treatment patterns and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease patients [^113RLUVo]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Patients were selected if they were adults with clinical ASCVD and had at least one LDL-C test result. Specifically, they needed to have had at least one nondiagnostic medical claim with a code for an ASCVD condition or procedure in the primary position during the identification period. ASCVD conditions and procedures included acute coronary syndrome, history of myocardial infarction, stable or unstable angina, coronary or peripheral artery revascularization, peripheral artery disease, ischemic stroke, and transient ischemic attack. Patients were required to be 21 years of age or older as of the index date and continuously enrolled in their health plan with medical and pharmacy benefits from the start of the 180-day baseline through the end of the 210-day follow-up, with at least one valid LDL-C test result in the laboratory database between days 30 and 210 after the index date. Patients who died during an inpatient stay before the index date, were pregnant, had actively treated cancer, or were undergoing lipoprotein apheresis were excluded from the study. Additionally, all patients were required to have complete enrollment and demographic data.

- **Study measures**: Study outcomes included statin use and intensity of statin before and after the 2013 guidelines release, as well as LDL-C levels. Statin use during the baseline period and the first month of follow-up was identified by a pharmacy claim for a statin and further categorized by statin intensity using the classifications described in the revised guidelines. The count of LDL-C results per patient (representing LDL-C orders) and laboratory results during the monitoring period were also assessed.

### Guideline-directed statin intensification in patients with new or worsening symptoms of peripheral artery disease [^1148j1Eo]. Clinical Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

The ACC/AHA cholesterol guidelines recommend that patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) be treated with a moderate to high-intensity statin. The extent to which patients with new or worsening PAD symptoms are offered guideline therapy is unknown.

- **Hypothesis**: There is significant variability in the rate of guideline-directed statin intensification across clinical practices.

- **Methods**: In the PORTRAIT registry, patterns of statin therapy were assessed in 1144 patients at 16 PAD specialty clinics between June 2011 and December 2015 before and after an evaluation for new or worsening claudication symptoms. We documented whether patients were treated with a guideline statin as well as the incidence of statin intensification. Statin intensification was defined as transitioning from no statin or low-intensity statin to moderate or high-intensity statin treatment. Patient factors associated with intensification were examined. Site and provider-level variation in intensification was summarized using an adjusted median odds ratio (aMOR).

- **Results**: Among 1144 patients, 810 (70.8%) were initially on guideline therapy compared to 334 (29.2%) that were not. In the latter, 103 (30.8%) received intensification following evaluation. Patients with typical symptoms displayed greater odds of intensification (OR 3.74; 95% CI: 1.23–11.41) while older patients had lower odds of intensification (OR 0.60/decade; 95% CI: 0.41–0.88). Site variability for statin intensification was observed across sites (aMOR = 3.15; 95% CI 1.22–9.60) [P = 0.02] but not providers (aMOR = 1.89; 95% CI 1.00–3.90).

### Association between intensity of statin therapy and mortality in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease [^115rxdHG]. JAMA Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

High-intensity statin therapy is recommended for the secondary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Nevertheless, statin therapy in general, and high-intensity statin therapy in particular, is underused in patients with established ASCVD.

- **Objective**: To determine the association between all-cause mortality and intensity of statin therapy in the Veterans Affairs health care system.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: A retrospective cohort analysis was conducted of patients aged 21 to 84 years with ASCVD treated in the Veterans Affairs health care system from April 1, 2013, to April 1, 2014. Patients who were included had one or more International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes for ASCVD on two or more different dates in the prior two years.

- **Exposures**: Intensity of statin therapy was defined by the 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines, and use was defined as a filled prescription in the prior six months. Patients were excluded if they were taking a higher statin dose in the prior five years.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: The primary outcome was death from all causes adjusted for the propensity to receive high-intensity statins.

- **Results**: The study sample included 509,766 eligible adults with ASCVD at baseline (mean [SD] age, 68.5 [8.8] years; 499,598 men and 10,168 women), including 150,928 (29.6%) receiving high-intensity statin therapy, 232,293 (45.6%) receiving moderate-intensity statin therapy, 33,920 (6.7%) receiving low-intensity statin therapy, and 92,625 (18.2%) receiving no statins.

### Present status of statin therapy [^113CCdo8]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Statins are cardioprotective agents that reduce the adverse effects of increased low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels. For significantly dyslipidemic persons who are at higher cardiovascular risk, combined statin therapy substantially reduces mortality risk. This therapy potentially forms an ideal risk-reducing combination, especially when coupled with lifestyle changes.

Decisions regarding the initiation of statin therapy for primary prevention, where the absolute risk reduction is much less, are more difficult as they involve evaluating LDL-C levels and higher C-reactive protein levels. For significantly dyslipidemic persons, combining intense exercise with statin therapy substantially reduces mortality risk, potentially making it an ideal risk-reducing strategy.

### Use of high-intensity statins for patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in the Veterans Affairs health system: Practice impact of the new cholesterol guidelines [^1148L3pH]. American Heart Journal (2016). Low credibility.

The November 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association cholesterol guidelines recommend the use of high-intensity statins for patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). We sought to determine how these guidelines are being adopted at the Veterans Affairs (VA) Health System and identify treatment gaps.

- **Methods**: We examined administrative data from the VA 12 months prior to the index dates of April 1, 2013, and after April 1, 2014, to identify patients ≤ 75 years of age with ≥ 2 codes for ASCVD. We identified those on high-intensity statin therapy (atorvastatin 40 mg or 80 mg, rosuvastatin 20 mg or 40 mg, and simvastatin 80 mg) during the 6 months after the index date.

- **Results**: The study sample included 331,927 and 326,759 eligible adults with ASCVD before and after the release of the new guidelines, respectively. Overall, high-intensity statin use increased from 28% to 35% after guideline release. High-intensity statin use was lowest in Hispanics and Native Americans, although all groups showed an increase over time. Among those on low- or moderate-intensity statin therapy, 15.6% were intensified to a high-intensity statin after guideline release. Groups less likely to undergo statin intensification were older adults (odds ratio = 0.78 for each 10-year increase, 95% CI 0.76–0.81), women (odds ratio = 0.86, 95% CI 0.75–0.99), and certain minority groups. Academic teaching hospitals and hospitals on the West Coast were more likely to intensify statins after release of the new guidelines.

### Comparison of ACC/AHA and ESC guideline recommendations following trial evidence for statin use in primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: Results from the population-based Rotterdam study [^116hvtiV]. JAMA Cardiology (2016). High credibility.

The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) and the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines both recommend lipid-lowering treatment for primary prevention based on global risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, randomized clinical trials (RCTs) for statin use have included participants with specific risk-factor profiles.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the overlap between the ACC/AHA and ESC guideline recommendations and available evidence from RCTs for statin use in primary prevention of CVD.

The design, setting, and participants of the study involved calculating the 10-year risk for hard atherosclerotic CVD (ASCVD) following the ACC/AHA guideline, 10-year risk of CVD mortality following the ESC guideline, and determining eligibility for each of 10 major RCTs for primary prevention of CVD. Conducted from July 2014 to August 2015, this study included 7279 individuals free of CVD, aged 45 to 75 years, examined between 1997 and 2008 for the Rotterdam Study, a prospective population-based cohort.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Proportions of individuals qualifying for lipid-lowering treatment per guidelines, proportions of individuals eligible for any of the 10 RCTs, overlap between these groups, and corresponding ASCVD incidence rates.

Results showed that of the 7279 individuals included in the study, 58.2% were women (n = 4238) and had a mean (SD) age of 61.1 (6.9) years. The ACC/AHA guidelines would recommend statin initiation in 4284 participants (58.9%), while the ESC guidelines would recommend in 2399 participants (33.0%), with an overlap of 95.8% with ACC/AHA.

### Effect of 2013 ACC/AHA blood cholesterol guidelines on statin treatment patterns and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease patients [^11715dC6]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

A total of 90,287 patients across 26 monthly cohorts were included in the analysis. Demographic characteristics were similar across each monthly cohort. For the overall sample, mean (SD) age was 68 (12) years, 50% were male, 30% had commercial insurance, and a little more than one half (55%) were located in the South. Peripheral artery revascularization was the most common ASCVD procedure met for study inclusion.

Overall statin use declined from 59% at 12 months before the guidelines' release to 47% at 13 months after the guidelines were released. In total, 55% of patients were using statins in the 12 months before the guidelines' release, and 49% were using statins after the guidelines were implemented (P < 0.001). Although statistically different, statin use during the first month after an ASCVD visit remained relatively constant before (32%) and after (31%) the new guidelines were implemented (P < 0.001). However, in patients receiving statins, the use of high-intensity statins increased from 27% before to 31% after the guidelines were implemented (P < 0.001).

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for statin-induced myopathy, more specifically with respect to laboratory tests, the ACC/AHA 2014 guidelines recommend considering obtaining liver function tests (LFTs) in patients with symptoms suggesting hepatotoxicity (such as unusual fatigue or weakness, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, dark-colored urine, or yellowing of the skin or sclera) arising during statin therapy.

### Effect of 2013 ACC/AHA blood cholesterol guidelines on statin treatment patterns and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease patients [^116uqt2p]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

High levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) are associated with a greater risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Approximately 85.6 million people in the United States have at least one type of cardiovascular disease (CVD). An additional 45 million people in the United States have either a ≥ 7.5% 10-year risk of a cardiovascular event (33 million) or a > 5% to 7.4% 10-year risk of a cardiovascular event (12.8 million). For patients at high risk for cardiovascular events or with ASCVD, statins are considered standard first-line therapy to lower LDL-C.

The appropriate statin dose is important to effectively lower LDL-C and, therefore, reduce the risk of ASCVD and cardiovascular events. However, not all patients are able to sufficiently lower their LDL-C levels, even at the maximally tolerated statin dose. Approximately 40% of patients are unable to adequately lower their LDL-C levels despite high-intensity statin therapy. For these patients, treatment regimens may be modified to include a higher statin dose, a switch to a different statin, or combination therapy with other lipid-lowering agents such as ezetimibe, bile acid sequestrants, niacin, or, when appropriate, an inhibitor of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9).

### 2013 ACC/AHA cholesterol guideline and implications for Healthy People 2020 cardiovascular disease prevention goals [^116ZyzwG]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). High credibility.

A prior analysis indicated that full implementation of the 2013 Cholesterol Guideline would prevent an additional ≈475,000 cardiovascular events over 10 years compared with full implementation of the Adult Treatment Panel (ATP)-3 Guideline. A cost-effectiveness analysis suggested that lowering the threshold for intervention from a 10-year ASCVD risk (ASCVD 10) from ≥ 7.5% to ≥ 3.0% would prevent an additional 161,650 ASCVD events over 10 years and was cost-effective, especially with low-cost statins. In both reports, only adults aged 40 to 75 years were included, and statins were assumed to reduce CHD by 25% and stroke by 17%, given a 39-mg/dL reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C).

The 2013 Cholesterol Guideline extends to a broader age range than 40 to 75 years for adults with clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease or LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL. Moreover, the percentage and absolute reduction in LDL-C are dose-dependent with high-intensity statins more effective than moderate-intensity statins in reducing ASCVD, although adverse effects also increase. Previous cholesterol guidelines also identified a favorable risk-benefit ratio for statins in adults aged ≥ 75 years with clinical ASCVD.

Given the importance of ASCVD prevention, we examined the impact of implementing the 2013 Cholesterol Guideline on two key outcomes. One outcome was to estimate the number of ASCVD events that could be prevented in the United States by providing statins to currently eligible individuals.

### Safety of aggressive lipid management [^112tZnRv]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2007). Low credibility.

Data from recent clinical trials of high- versus moderate-dose statin therapy support the recommendation to achieve a low-density lipoprotein (LDL) of less than 100 mg/dl in high-risk patients and reveal that many patients will require a high-dose statin to achieve this goal. Overall, low rates of serious musculoskeletal (less than 0.6%) and hepatic (less than 1.3%) toxicity have been observed with high-dose statin therapy. In the long-term trials, atorvastatin 80 mg had higher rates of persistent transaminase elevations, but rates of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis were similar to those with lower doses of statins. The rate of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis for simvastatin 80 mg, although still low, was about four times higher than for atorvastatin 80 mg and lower doses of statin. A similar margin of safety would be expected in properly selected patients with characteristics similar to those who participated in the clinical trials.

High-dose statin therapy or combination therapy will be required for the large majority of very high-risk patients to achieve the optional LDL goal of less than 70 mg/dl. While the combination of ezetimibe, bile-acid sequestering agents, niacin, and fenofibrate with moderate-dose statins appears to be reasonably safe, the long-term safety of combination with high-dose statins remains to be established. In order to optimize patient outcomes, clinicians should be aware of specific patient characteristics, such as advancing age, gender, body mass index, or glomerular filtration rate, which predict muscle and hepatic statin toxicity.

### Safety and effectiveness of high-intensity statins versus low/moderate-intensity statins plus ezetimibe in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease for reaching LDL-C goals: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^114VQNXt]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

The effectiveness and safety of adding ezetimibe to low/moderate-intensity statins compared to high-intensity statin regimens in treating patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) remains a topic of debate. The hypothesis is that a combination of low/moderate-intensity statins plus ezetimibe might be more effective and safer than high-intensity statin monotherapy.

- **Methods**: We searched databases for randomized controlled trials comparing lipid profile alterations, drug-related adverse events, and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) components between high-intensity statin monotherapy and low/moderate-intensity statin plus ezetimibe combination therapy. Pooled risk ratios (RR), mean differences (MD), and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were estimated using a random-effects model.

- **Results**: Our comprehensive search yielded 32 studies with 6162 patients treated with monotherapy and 5880 patients on combination therapy. Combination therapy was more effective in reducing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels compared to monotherapy (MD = -6.6, 95% CI: -10.6 to -2.5); however, no significant differences were observed in other lipid parameters. The combination therapy group also experienced a lower risk of myalgia (RR = 0.27, 95% CI: 0.13–0.57) and discontinuation due to adverse events (RR = 0.61, 95% CI: 0.51–0.74). The occurrence of MACE was similar between the two treatment groups.

- **Conclusions**: Adding ezetimibe to low/moderate-intensity statins led to a greater reduction in LDL-C levels and a lower rate of myalgia without compromising the occurrence of MACE.

### Trends in prevalence of guideline-based use of lipid-lowering therapy in a large health system [^1153sE21]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Low credibility.

The 2013 ACC/AHA (American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association) cholesterol guidelines provided an evidence-based rationale for the allocation of lipid-lowering therapy based on risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Adoption of these guidelines was initially suboptimal, but whether this has improved over time remains unclear.

- **Hypothesis**: Prevalence of guideline-based statin therapy will increase over time.

- **Methods**: Electronic health record data were used to create two cross-sectional data sets of patients (age 40–75) served in 2013 and 2017 by a large health system. Data sets included demographics, clinical risk factors, lipid values, diagnostic codes, and active medication orders during each period. Prevalence of indications for statin therapy according to the ACC/AHA guidelines and statin prescriptions were compared between each time period.

- **Results**: In 2013, of the 219,376 adults, 57.7% of patients met statin eligibility criteria, of which 61.3% were prescribed any statin and 19.0% a high-intensity statin. Among those eligible, statin use was highest in those with established ASCVD (83.9%) and lowest in those with elevated ASCVD risk > 7.5% (39.3%). In 2017, of the 256,074 adults, 62.3% were statin eligible, of which 62.3% were prescribed a statin and 24.3% a high-intensity statin. In 2017, 66.4% of statin-eligible men were prescribed a statin compared to 57.4% of statin-eligible women (P < 0.001). The use of ezetimibe (3.6% in 2013, 2.4% in 2017) and protein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors (< 0.1% and 0.1%) was infrequent.

In November 2018, the American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology (AHA/ACC) released a new clinical practice guideline on cholesterol management, accompanied by a risk assessment report on the primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD).

- **Methods**: A panel of experts, free of recent and relevant industry-related conflicts, was selected to conduct systematic reviews and meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) examining cardiovascular outcomes. High-quality observational studies were employed for estimating ASCVD risk. An independent panel systematically reviewed RCT evidence regarding the benefits and risks of adding nonstatin medications to statin therapy compared with statin therapy alone in individuals at high risk for ASCVD.

- **Recommendation**: The guideline endorses a heart-healthy lifestyle beginning in childhood to reduce lifetime risk for ASCVD and includes several new features compared to the 2013 guideline. For secondary prevention, patients at very high risk may consider adding nonstatin medications (ezetimibe or proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 [PCSK9] inhibitors) to statin therapy. In primary prevention, a clinician-patient risk discussion is strongly recommended before deciding on statin treatment. The AHA/ACC risk calculator categorizes patients into four risk categories. Those at intermediate risk deserve a focused clinician-patient discussion before initiating statin therapy. Among intermediate-risk patients, identification of further risk factors is crucial for informed decision-making.

### Statins for all [^116p6how]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Recent guidelines for cholesterol management proposed by the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and American Heart Association (AHA) recommend statin therapy for most men in their 60s and most women in their 70s. If these guidelines are followed in the United States, most adults will eventually take statins. A companion article in this journal goes a step further by proposing statin initiation for nearly everyone about 10 years earlier. Treatment in the ACC/AHA guidelines does not depend on cholesterol levels, either for statin initiation or treatment goals. Instead, the selection of patients for statin therapy is based on a multifactorial risk assessment derived from prospective studies in subgroups of the U.S. population.

Due to the expansion of statin therapy, the issue of the reliability of risk assessment has become prominent. Some evidence suggests that the ACC/AHA risk algorithm overestimates risk in many people; if so, this would lead to statin therapy beyond what was intended. Some investigators favor assessment of risk based on the presence or absence of categorical risk factors or higher-risk conditions. Others propose the selection of individuals for statin therapy grounded in measurement of atherosclerosis burden.

Finally, an alternate approach to cholesterol management is to establish cholesterol goals for secondary and primary prevention. Here, cholesterol levels, and not global risk assessment, define the intensity of therapy. The use of cholesterol goals allows more flexibility in treatment by taking advantage of lifestyle therapies and various drugs and their doses to achieve these goals.

### Lipid testing and statin dosing after acute myocardial infarction [^114vDKLP]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

The 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association cholesterol guidelines recommend high-intensity statins for patients after myocardial infarction (MI) rather than treating to a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol goal, as the previous ATP III (Adult Treatment Panel third report) guidelines had advised.

- **Methods and results**: To evaluate the frequency of postdischarge lipid testing and high-intensity statin use among MI patients discharged on a statin during the ATP III guidelines era, we linked ACTION (Acute Coronary Treatment and Intervention Outcomes Network) Registry data to Medicare claims for 11,046 MI patients aged ≥ 65 years who were discharged alive on a statin from 347 hospitals (2007–2009). Multivariable regression was used to evaluate the association between lipid testing and 1-year high-intensity statin use.

Only 21% of MI patients were discharged on a high-intensity statin. By 90 days after MI, 44% of patients discharged on a statin underwent lipid testing (43% on low- or moderate-intensity statins and 49% on high-intensity statins; P = 0.001). Follow-up lipid testing rates were 47% among patients with in-hospital low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ≥ 100 mg/dL and 47% among newly prescribed statin recipients. By 1 year, only 14% of patients were on high-intensity statins. Only 4% of patients discharged on low- or moderate-dose statin were uptitrated to high intensity; postdischarge lipid testing was associated with a slightly higher likelihood of high-intensity statin use by 1 year (5.4% versus 2.9%, adjusted odds ratio: 1.92; 95% confidence interval).

Regarding diagnostic investigations for statin-induced myopathy — more specifically with respect to laboratory tests — the 2019 AAPA/ABC/ACC/ACPM/ADA/AGS/AHA/APhA/ASPC/PCNA guidelines recommend measuring CK levels in patients with severe statin-associated muscle symptoms and objective muscle weakness.

Regarding medical management for hypertriglyceridemia, specifically with respect to statins, the EAS/ESC 2020 guidelines recommend initiating statins as a first-line therapy to reduce cardiovascular risk in high-risk patients with hypertriglyceridemia (triglyceride levels > 2.3 mmol/L; > 200 mg/dL).

### Initiation patterns of statins in the 2 years after release of the 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) cholesterol management guideline in a large US health plan [^111P7FJK]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). High credibility.

The 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) cholesterol management guideline suggests several significant changes to the former treatment paradigm for lipid therapy. One of the most controversial aspects of the guideline is the movement away from a low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C) target attainment approach to a statin initiation strategy. This strategy selects statin intensity based on clinical trial evidence of reduction of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events through the use of statins in specific populations.

The ACC/AHA guideline recommendations result from an analysis of pooled evidence from randomized clinical trials. The guideline recommends evaluating a patient's future risk for ASCVD events. For individuals in whom the benefit of statin treatment is likely to be greater than the risk of adverse events, statin therapy is recommended. With this approach, individuals should be placed on the evidence‐based, preferred intensity of statin, with adjustments made, if necessary, to accommodate any tolerability issues for that individual. Monitoring LDL‐C levels is then performed to assess the appropriate response to a specific intensity of statin therapy and adherence to therapy. Following this evidence‐based approach, the recommendation for many of these patients is a high‐intensity statin.

Regarding medical management for statin-induced myopathy, and specifically in terms of treatment modifications, the 2019 guidelines from AAPA/ABC/ACC/ACPM/ADA/AGS/AHA/APhA/ASPC/PCNA recommend considering the addition of a non-statin drug (such as ezetimibe or a bile acid sequestrant) to moderate-intensity statin therapy. This is advised for intermediate-risk adult patients who require more aggressive LDL-C reduction but cannot tolerate high-intensity statin therapy.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for dyslipidemia, particularly in the context of monitoring for adverse effects of statins, the 2019 guidelines by AAPA/ABC/ACC/ACPM/ADA/AGS/AHA/APhA/ASPC/PCNA recommend conducting a clinician-patient risk discussion before the initiation of statin therapy. This discussion should review the net clinical benefit, weighing the potential for ASCVD risk reduction against the potential for statin-associated side effects, statin-drug interactions, and safety. It emphasizes that side effects can be addressed successfully.

### Is high-intensity statin therapy associated with lower statin adherence compared with low- to moderate-intensity statin therapy? Implications of the 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association cholesterol management guidelines [^113TtxoW]. Clinical Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

The recent cholesterol guideline recommends high-intensity statins for cardiovascular disease (CVD) patients. High-intensity statins are associated with more frequent side effects; therefore, it may be of concern that these recommendations might reduce statin adherence.

- **Hypothesis**: High-intensity statins are associated with lower adherence compared with low- to moderate-intensity statins.

- **Methods**: In a national database of 972,532 CVD patients from the Veterans Health Administration, we identified patients receiving statins between October 1, 2010, and September 30, 2011. We assessed statin adherence by calculating the proportion of days covered (PDC) and determined whether high-intensity statin therapy was independently associated with a lower PDC.

- **Results**: Statins were prescribed in 629,005 (64.7%) patients. Of those, 229,437 (36.5%) received high-intensity statins. Mean PDC (0.87 vs. 0.86, P < 0.0001) and patients with PDC ≥ 0.80 (76.3% vs. 74.2%, P < 0.0001) were slightly higher for those receiving low- to moderate-intensity compared with high-intensity statins. In adjusted analyses, high-intensity statin use was associated with a significant but modest PDC reduction compared with low- to moderate-intensity statin use, whether PDC was assessed as a continuous (β-coefficient: -0.008, P < 0.0001) or categorical (PDC ≥ 0.80 [odds ratio: 0.94, 95% confidence interval: 0.93–0.96]) measure of statin adherence.

- **Conclusions**: An approach of high-intensity statin therapy will lead to a significant practice change, as the majority of CVD patients are not on high-intensity therapy.

### Effect of 2013 ACC/AHA blood cholesterol guidelines on statin treatment patterns and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease patients [^1161CbN6]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Preceding the release of the 2013 American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) cholesterol guidelines, prescribers aimed for specific low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) goals in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). The 2013 guidelines changed this focus to treating patients with appropriate statin intensity given their ASCVD risk. We examined statin use and LDL-C levels before and after the 2013 ACC/AHA guidelines in patients with clinical ASCVD as defined in the guidelines.

- **Methods and results**: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of adult commercial and Medicare Advantage health plan enrollees in the Optum Research Database. Patients had ≥ 1 claim with a diagnosis of clinical ASCVD between November 1, 2012, and December 31, 2014, and were continuously enrolled 6 months before (baseline) and 7 months after (follow-up) the first ASCVD visit. Patients were assigned to monthly cohorts based on the ASCVD event month. Statin use and intensity were measured at baseline and the first month of follow-up. LDL-C changes were assessed using ordinary least squares regression. For 90,287 patients, the mean (SD) age was 68 (12) years; 50% were female, and 30% had commercial insurance. Statin use remained consistent before and after guidelines (32% and 31%, respectively). Of patients receiving statins, high-intensity use increased by 4 percentage points 1 year after guidelines (P < 0.001). Mean LDL-C levels were 2.4 mmol/L (94 mg/dL) both pre- and post-guidelines.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for statin-induced myopathy, specifically with respect to pretreatment assessment, the ACC/AHA 2014 guidelines recommend deciding on the choice of the appropriate statin and dose based on patient characteristics, level of ASCVD risk, and potential for adverse effects to maximize the safety of statins. Offer moderate-intensity statin therapy to patients otherwise requiring high-intensity statin therapy if they have characteristics predisposing them to statin-associated adverse effects. Recognize that characteristics predisposing patients to statin adverse effects include, but are not limited to:

- **Multiple or serious comorbidities**: Including impaired renal or hepatic function.
- **History of previous statin intolerance or muscle disorders**.
- **Unexplained ALT elevations**: ALT levels ≥ 3 times the ULN.
- **Patient characteristics or concomitant use of drugs affecting statin metabolism**.

### 2021 Canadian cardiovascular society guidelines for the management of dyslipidemia for the prevention of cardiovascular disease in adults [^1151qvi4]. The Canadian Journal of Cardiology (2021). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for dyslipidemia, specifically in relation to statins, the CCS 2021 guidelines recommend initiating high-intensity statin therapy, alongside appropriate health behavior modifications, for secondary prevention in patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD). It is advised to administer the maximally tolerated statin dose in patients who cannot tolerate high-intensity statins.

### Scientific evidence underlying the ACC/AHA clinical practice guidelines [^114xHbqB]. JAMA (2009). High credibility.

The joint cardiovascular practice guidelines of the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and the American Heart Association (AHA) have become important documents for guiding cardiology practice and establishing benchmarks for quality of care.

- **Objective**: To describe the evolution of recommendations in ACC/AHA cardiovascular guidelines and the distribution of recommendations across classes of recommendations and levels of evidence.

- **Data sources and study selection**: Data from all ACC/AHA practice guidelines issued from 1984 to September 2008 were abstracted by personnel in the ACC Science and Quality Division. Fifty-three guidelines on 22 topics, including a total of 7,196 recommendations, were abstracted.

- **Data extraction**: The number of recommendations and the distribution of classes of recommendation (I, II, and III) and levels of evidence (A, B, and C) were determined. The subset of guidelines that were current as of September 2008 was evaluated to describe changes in recommendations between the first and later versions, as well as patterns in levels of evidence used in the versions.

- **Results**: Among guidelines with at least one revision or update by September 2008, the number of recommendations increased from 1,330 to 1,973 (+48%) from the first to the later version, with the largest increase observed in the use of class II recommendations. Considering the 16 guidelines reporting levels of evidence, only 314 recommendations of 2,711 total are classified as level of evidence A (median, 11%), whereas 1,246 (median, 48%) are level of evidence C.

### 2013 ACC/AHA guideline on the treatment of blood cholesterol to reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular risk in adults: A report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Task Force on Practice Guidelines [^116L28qx]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for statin-induced myopathy, specifically with respect to laboratory tests, the ACC/AHA 2014 guidelines recommend considering the measurement of CK levels in patients with muscle symptoms. These symptoms include pain, tenderness, stiffness, cramping, weakness, or generalized fatigue during statin therapy.

### Effect of 2013 ACC/AHA blood cholesterol guidelines on statin treatment patterns and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease patients [^115e1AQY]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). High credibility.

Preceding the release of the 2013 American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) blood cholesterol guidelines (hereafter referred to as the "2013 guidelines" or simply "guidelines"), LDL‐C goals were < 4.1 mmol/L (160 mg/dL) for patients with a single CVD risk factor, < 3.4 mmol/L (130 mg/dL) for patients with two or more risk factors, and < 2.6 mmol/L (100 mg/dL) for patients with known CVD or risk factor equivalent. The guidelines were revised in 2013 to recommend moving away from a "treating to goal" approach with respect to LDL‐C and instead focus on treating with the most appropriate statin intensity based on the patient's risk.

The four statin benefit groups described in the guidelines are:

- **Clinical ASCVD**: Patients with clinical ASCVD.
- **Elevated LDL-C**: Adult patients with LDL‐C ≥ 4.9 mmol/L (190 mg/dL).
- **Diabetes mellitus**: Patients aged 40 to 75 years with diabetes mellitus and LDL‐C levels 1.8 to 4.9 mmol/L (70–189 mg/dL).
- **Primary prevention**: Patients with an estimated 10‐year ASCVD risk ≥ 7.5% and LDL‐C levels 1.8 to less than 4.9 mmol/L (70–189 mg/dL).

In general, high‐intensity statin therapy is recommended for those in statin benefit groups 1 and 2, whereas moderate‐ or high‐intensity statin therapy is recommended for most patients in statin benefit group 3. For statin benefit group 4, the recommendation is to estimate the 10‐year ASCVD risk and engage in patient‐clinician discussions to determine an appropriate course of action.

In addition, the 2013 guidelines no longer recommend monitoring LDL‐C to assess achievement of a particular LDL‐C.

### Initiation patterns of statins in the 2 years after release of the 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) cholesterol management guideline in a large US health plan [^116k55jr]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Where the present study differs from other published research that analyzed the uptake of the ACC/AHA guideline is in the evaluation of adherence to the guideline recommendations regarding choice of statin intensity at initiation of therapy in a broad and geographically diverse US population, rather than analyzing eligibility for statin initiation based on the ACC/AHA guideline using pre-guideline data or assessing adherence to the guideline in a relatively small, single-health-system population.

Both Zupec et al. and Bellows et al. evaluated adherence to the guideline in a single-health-system population limited by ASCVD diagnosis. Zupec et al. observed treatment pattern changes for 1 year post-guideline and found a significant increase in the initiation of high-intensity statins from 26.0% to 45.0% (P = 0.01) in ASCVD patients 18 to 75 years of age within primary care practices. Bellows observed treatment patterns for 6 months post-guideline and found that initiation of high-intensity statins increased from 16.3% in the historical cohort to 23.7% post-guideline (P < 0.001).

The results of the present research show that the ACC/AHA guideline appeared to have a moderate effect on initiation of high-intensity statins in the period immediately following its release among patients who were previously naïve to statin medications and who were in the high-intensity statin recommendation categories. In patients who were in the moderate-intensity statin recommendation categories, the initiation of moderate-intensity statins was essentially unchanged before and after the guideline.

### An oral PCSK9 inhibitor for treatment of hypercholesterolemia: The PURSUIT randomized trial [^11233xY1]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Most patients at high risk for cardiovascular events do not achieve lipid goals advocated by the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines despite the wide availability of lipid-lowering therapy. AZD0780 is a novel, oral, small-molecule inhibitor of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) in development as a once-daily treatment for hypercholesterolemia.

- **Objectives**: The phase 2 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter PURSUIT trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of AZD0780 in patients with hypercholesterolemia already on background moderate- to high-intensity statin treatment.

- **Methods**: Eligible study patients had a fasting low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level of ≥ 70 mg/dL (1.8 mmol/L) and < 190 mg/dL (4.9 mmol/L), and triglycerides < 400 mg/dL on a stable dose of moderate- or high-intensity statins, as defined by ACC/AHA or local guidelines, with or without ezetimibe at baseline. The study randomized patients in a 1:1:1:1:1 ratio to receive AZD0780 1, 3, 10, or 30 mg, or matching placebo, orally once daily for 12 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint was the percent change of LDL-C from baseline to week 12. Safety and tolerability evaluations included the number of adverse events, vital signs, electrocardiograms, and laboratory assessments.

- **Results**: In total, the study randomized 428 patients, of whom 426 started treatment. Patients were 52.1% male, with an average age of 62.4 ± 7.6 years. At week 12, compared with baseline, the placebo-corrected difference in least squares mean percent change of LDL-C.

### Safety and effectiveness of high-intensity statins versus low/moderate-intensity statins plus ezetimibe in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease for reaching LDL-C goals: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^111QnvpL]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

It remains controversial whether adding ezetimibe to low/moderate‐intensity statins has a more beneficial impact on the treatment efficacy and safety of patients with existing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) compared to high‐intensity statin regimens.

A combination of low/moderate‐intensity statins plus ezetimibe might be more effective and safer than high‐intensity statin monotherapy.

We searched databases for randomized controlled trials comparing lipid profile alterations, drug‐related adverse events, and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) components between high‐intensity statin monotherapy and low/moderate‐intensity statin plus ezetimibe combination therapy. Pooled risk ratios (RR), mean differences (MD), and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were estimated using a random‐effects model.

Our comprehensive search resulted in 32 studies comprising 6,162 patients treated with monotherapy against 5,880 patients on combination therapy. Combination therapy was more effective in reducing low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C) levels compared to monotherapy (MD = −6.6, 95% CI: −10.6 to −2.5); however, no significant differences were observed in other lipid parameters. Furthermore, the combination therapy group experienced a lower risk of myalgia (RR = 0.27, 95% CI: 0.13–0.57) and discontinuation due to adverse events (RR = 0.61, 95% CI: 0.51–0.74). The occurrence of MACE was similar between the two treatment groups.

Adding ezetimibe to low/moderate‐intensity statins resulted in a greater reduction in LDL‐C levels and a lower risk of adverse effects compared to high-intensity statins alone.

### High-intensity versus non-high-intensity statins in patients achieving low-density lipoprotein cholesterol goal after percutaneous coronary intervention [^113xZBmH]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Whether the use of high-intensity statins is more important than achieving the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) target remains controversial in patients with coronary artery disease. We sought to investigate the association between statin intensity and long-term clinical outcomes in patients achieving the treatment target for LDL-C after percutaneous coronary intervention.

Methods and Results: Between February 2003 and December 2014, 1,746 patients who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention and achieved the treatment target for LDL-C (50% reduction from baseline level) were studied. We classified patients into two groups according to the intensity of statin prescribed after the index percutaneous coronary intervention:

- **High-intensity statin group**: Atorvastatin 40 or 80 mg, and rosuvastatin 20 mg (372 patients).
- **Non-high-intensity statin group**: Other statin treatments (1,374 patients).

The primary outcome was a composite of cardiac death, myocardial infarction, or stroke. The difference in time-averaged LDL-C during follow-up was significant but small between the high-intensity statin group and the non-high-intensity statin group (59 ± 13 versus 61 ± 12 mg/dL; P = 0.04). At five years, patients receiving high-intensity statins had a significantly lower incidence of the primary outcome than those treated with non-high-intensity statins (4.1% versus 9.9%; hazard ratio, 0.42; 95% confidence interval, 0.23–0.79; P < 0.01). Results were consistent after propensity-score matching (4.2% versus 11.2%; hazard ratio, 0.36; 95% confidence interval, 0.19–0.69; P < 0.01).

### Safety and efficacy of moderate-intensity statin with ezetimibe in elderly patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease [^113SrUQq]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

High-intensity statin therapy significantly reduces mortality and cardiovascular events in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). However, moderate-intensity statins are often preferred for elderly patients due to their higher risk of intolerance to high-intensity statins.

- **Objective**: To compare the incidence of statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS) and the effect on low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels between elderly ASCVD patients receiving high-intensity statin monotherapy and those receiving moderate-intensity statin with ezetimibe in combination therapy.

- **Method**: In a prospective, multicenter, open-label trial conducted in South Korea, 561 patients aged 70 years or above with ASCVD were randomly assigned to receive either moderate-intensity statin with ezetimibe combination therapy (rosuvastatin 5 mg with ezetimibe 10 mg) or high-intensity statin monotherapy (rosuvastatin 20 mg) over 6 months. The primary endpoint was the incidence of SAMS, and the key secondary endpoint was the achievement of target LDL-C levels (< 70 mg/dL) within 6 months.

- **Results**: The primary endpoint showed a lower incidence of SAMS in the combination therapy group (0.7%) compared to the high-intensity statin monotherapy group (5.7%, p = 0.005). Both groups achieved similar LDL-C levels, with 75.4% in the combination therapy group and 68.7% in the monotherapy group reaching target levels.

- **Conclusion**: Moderate-intensity statin with ezetimibe combination therapy offers a lower risk of SAMS and similar LDL-C reduction in elderly patients with ASCVD.

Regarding specific circumstances for dyslipidemia, especially in patients with hypertriglyceridemia, the EAS/ESC 2020 guidelines recommend initiating statins as first-line therapy. This is to reduce cardiovascular risk in high-risk patients with hypertriglyceridemia, defined as triglyceride levels greater than 200 mg/dL or 2.3 mmol/L.

### Systematic review for the 2018 AHA/ACC/AACVPR/AAPA/ABC/ACPM/ADA/AGS/APHA/ASPC/NLA/PCNA guideline on the management of blood cholesterol: A report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Task Force on Clinical Practice Guidelines [^111vV5cj]. Circulation (2019). High credibility.

The 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines for the treatment of blood cholesterol found little evidence to support the use of nonstatin lipid-modifying medications to reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events. Since publication of these guidelines, multiple randomized controlled trials evaluating nonstatin lipid-modifying medications have been published.

- **Methods**: We performed a systematic review to assess the magnitude of benefit and/or harm from additional lipid-modifying therapies compared with statins alone in individuals with known ASCVD or at high risk of ASCVD. We included data from randomized controlled trials with a sample size of over 1,000 patients and designed for follow-up longer than one year. We performed a comprehensive literature search and identified 10 randomized controlled trials for intensive review, including trials evaluating ezetimibe, niacin, cholesterol-ester transfer protein inhibitors, and PCSK9 inhibitors. The prespecified primary outcome for this review was a composite of fatal cardiovascular events, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and nonfatal stroke.

- **Results**: The cardiovascular benefit of nonstatin lipid-modifying therapies varied significantly according to the class of medication. There was evidence for reduced ASCVD morbidity with ezetimibe and two PSCK9 inhibitors; a reduced ASCVD mortality rate was reported for one PCSK9 inhibitor. The use of ezetimibe/simvastatin versus simvastatin in IMPROVE-IT (Improved Reduction of Outcomes: Vytorin Efficacy International Trial) reduced the primary outcome.

### Effect of 2013 ACC/AHA blood cholesterol guidelines on statin treatment patterns and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease patients [^116jtXes]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

This study showed that following the release of the 2013 ACC/AHA guidelines, high‐intensity statin treatment modestly increased, but the number of statin prescriptions overall decreased, and mean LDL‐C levels remained largely unchanged. The 2013 guidelines focused on utilizing appropriate statin intensity and percentage reduction of LDL‐C, rather than treatment goals, and were predicted to increase the overall use of statins. Our data suggest that the guidelines did not significantly alter clinician behavior with regard to the treatment of hyperlipidemia. Future updates to clinical treatment guidelines may require more intensive educational efforts centered on practicing clinicians and a simplification of, or change in, recommendations set forth in the guidelines in order to improve physician understanding and use.

### Cardiology clinic visit increases likelihood of evidence-based cholesterol prescribing in severe hypercholesterolemia [^114DEuaL]. Clinical Cardiology (2021). Low credibility.

Medications were pulled from the patient's active medication list. Only atorvastatin 40 mg or 80 mg, or rosuvastatin 20 mg or 40 mg, were considered high‐intensity statins. All other statin medications and doses were considered low‐ or moderate‐intensity. Due to their effectiveness in LDL lowering, patients prescribed a proprotein convertase subtilisin‐kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitor were grouped with the high‐intensity statin cohort, while patients prescribed ezetimibe were combined with the low‐ to moderate‐intensity statin group. Statin allergies were obtained from the patient's allergy list.

Baseline risk factors were obtained from the problem list using ICD‐10 diagnoses, recent vitals, and laboratory results. Diabetes was defined as the most recent glucose ≥ 126 mg/dl, A1c ≥ 6.5%, or currently taking a glucose-lowering medication. Patients who did not have lab values or medication information on file were compared against a diabetes registry and considered diabetic if they ever had an active status. Hypertension was defined as blood pressure ≥ 140/90 mm Hg or currently taking antihypertensive medication. Patients who did not have vitals or medication information on file were compared against a hypertension registry and considered to have hypertension if they ever had an active status. Obesity was defined as body mass index ≥ 30 mg/m². Smoking status was asked at the most recent visit and defined as never smoker, former smoker (quit < 12 months prior), and smoker. Prior CVD was defined as ever having an ICD‐10 diagnosis of ASCVD on their problem list.

### Safety and effectiveness of high-intensity statins versus low/moderate-intensity statins plus ezetimibe in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease for reaching LDL-C goals: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^111JM65m]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Low credibility.

We did not find a meaningful difference in MACE between the two treatment methods. The results of the meta-analysis conducted by Zhan et al. in 2018 also corroborate comparable all-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality between the two treatment groups. However, patients have a lower risk of non-fatal MI and stroke in the combination therapy group. The findings of the cohort study conducted by Kim et al. were also in agreement with our finding by showing that there was no significant difference in the risk of non-fatal MI, repeat revascularization, stroke, and all-cause mortality between the two treatment groups following a 5-year follow-up.

- **Main hypotheses**: There are two main hypotheses to elucidate the conflicting outcomes. First, most analyses on MACE outcomes didn't comprise patients who discontinued their treatment due to adverse events and who were more susceptible to cardiovascular outcomes. Second, the different dosages and types of statins used in various therapies among the related studies could be an underlying cause of these conflicting results.

Although our study did not demonstrate a clear superiority of combination therapy in reducing MACE, the significant reduction in LDL-C levels and improved tolerability profiles observed with this approach may still provide important clinical benefits. Clinicians should consider these factors when weighing the risks and benefits of statin monotherapy versus combination therapy for individual patients.

### Comparing HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors [^111jVJnN]. Clinical Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

The statins have proven to be some of the most potent therapies for reducing elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and lessening the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) and related events. Nonetheless, there are still questions about the clinical relevance of individual drug characteristics, such as chemical derivation, solubility properties, and metabolic route, in terms of tolerability or therapeutic benefit. At the same time, no clear explanation has emerged for the significantly steeper reductions in LDL cholesterol levels achieved with atorvastatin versus lovastatin, simvastatin, pravastatin, or fluvastatin, or, more recently, with rosuvastatin versus atorvastatin, although possible mechanisms have been suggested.

More studies are needed to characterize the effects of statins on high-density lipoprotein (HDL) in different patient groups. Clearly, though, several statins have yielded significant reductions in CHD risk and have shown to be well tolerated in both primary and secondary prevention trials. The possibility that statins exert pronounced effects beyond lowering blood lipids is opening other avenues of research into the benefits of these drugs.

### Effect of 2013 ACC/AHA blood cholesterol guidelines on statin treatment patterns and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease patients [^114mKMbv]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Our analysis furthermore demonstrates that LDL‐C levels in patients were similar in the year before and year following the release of the new guidelines. Mean LDL‐C levels were approximately 2.4 mmol/L (94 mg/dL) both before and after publication of the 2013 guidelines. Similarly, the percentage of patients who achieved an LDL‐C level < 2.6 mmol/L (100 mg/dL) or < 1.8 mmol/L (70 mg/dL) was similar across all month cohorts. These data suggest that the revised guidelines had a modest impact on practice and real‐world LDL‐C levels, even in this population of patients with a higher severity of disease who are recommended to be prescribed the most intensive therapy. However, we did observe lower LDL‐C levels in patients who used high‐intensity statins, confirming that following the guidelines results in lower LDL‐C.

Regarding preventative measures for statin-induced myopathy, more specifically with respect to pretreatment assessment, the AAPA, ABC, ACC, ACPM, ADA, AGS, AHA, APhA, ASPC, and PCNA 2019 guidelines recommend conducting a clinician-patient risk discussion before initiating statin therapy. This discussion should review the net clinical benefit, weighing the potential for ASCVD risk reduction against the potential for statin-associated side effects, drug-drug interactions, and safety, while emphasizing that side effects can be addressed successfully. The guidelines also promote shared decision-making, taking into account patient preferences.

### Long-term efficacy and safety of moderate-intensity statin with ezetimibe combination therapy versus high-intensity statin monotherapy in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (RACING): a randomised, open-label, non-inferiority trial [^1176JZZp]. Lancet (2022). High credibility.

Drug combinations rather than increasing doses of one drug can achieve greater efficacy and lower risks. Thus, as an alternative to high-intensity statin monotherapy, moderate-intensity statin with ezetimibe combination therapy can lower LDL cholesterol concentrations effectively while reducing adverse effects. However, evidence from randomised trials to compare long-term clinical outcomes is needed.

- **Methods**: In this randomised, open-label, non-inferiority trial, patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) at 26 clinical centres in South Korea were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either moderate-intensity statin with ezetimibe combination therapy (rosuvastatin 10 mg with ezetimibe 10 mg) or high-intensity statin monotherapy (rosuvastatin 20 mg). The primary endpoint was the 3-year composite of cardiovascular death, major cardiovascular events, or non-fatal stroke, in the intention-to-treat population with a non-inferiority margin of 2.0%. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03044665 and is complete.

- **Findings**: Between Feb 14, 2017, and Dec 18, 2018, 3780 patients were enrolled: 1894 patients to the combination therapy group and 1886 to the high-intensity statin monotherapy group. The primary endpoint occurred in 172 patients (9.1%) in the combination therapy group and 186 patients (9.9%) in the high-intensity statin monotherapy group (absolute difference -0.78%; 90% CI -2.39 to 0.83). LDL cholesterol concentrations of less than 70 mg/dL at 1, 2, and 3 years were observed in 73%, 75%, and 72% of patients in the combination therapy group.

### Safety and effectiveness of high-intensity statins versus low/moderate-intensity statins plus ezetimibe in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease for reaching LDL-C goals: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^116UxjEg]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of global mortality and disability, with elevated serum lipid levels, particularly low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C), being one of its major risk factors. Lowering LDL‐C is crucial in mitigating the negative outcomes of CVD, especially in patients with a history of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Statins are the first‐line therapy for patients with ASCVD for LDL‐C elevations; however, many patients on low/moderate‐intensity statin regimens fail to attain target LDL‐C levels. Contemporary guidelines recommend high‐intensity statins for hyperlipidemia treatment, but they come with challenges such as drug interactions and dose‐dependent adverse events. An alternative approach is combining ezetimibe, a non‐statin drug, with tolerated statin dosages. Ezetimibe has shown efficacy in lowering LDL‐C alongside a more favorable safety profile.

However, previous meta‐analyses have shown conflicting information regarding the superiority in efficacy or safety profile of high‐intensity statin monotherapy compared to low/moderate‐intensity statin combined with ezetimibe therapy. Given the recent randomized controlled trials (RCTs), we aimed to conduct a comprehensive systematic review and meta‐analysis comparing the efficacy and safety of these two lipid‐lowering strategies in ASCVD patients.
