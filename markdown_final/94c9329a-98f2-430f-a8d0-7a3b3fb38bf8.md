## Question

Dapagliflozin for central diabetes insipidus

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the role of dapagliflozin in central diabetes insipidus (CDI), including any diagnostic or therapeutic implications and what to do if a patient with suspected or confirmed CDI is taking an SGLT2 inhibitor like dapagliflozin. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about dapagliflozin's approved indications and renal effects. Then, I should review CDI pathophysiology and standard treatment. Next, I will examine how SGLT2-induced glycosuria and osmotic diuresis may confound CDI diagnosis. After that, I will assess case-based evidence for a masking effect and safety risks. Finally, I will outline practical management steps, including whether and when to stop dapagliflozin, how to test for CDI accurately, and how to initiate desmopressin safely.

> Let me first confirm indications and mechanism so I don't over- or understate claims: dapagliflozin is an SGLT2 inhibitor approved for type 2 diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and heart failure, not for any form of diabetes insipidus, and its mechanism is to inhibit proximal tubular glucose and sodium reabsorption, promoting glycosuria and natriuresis with osmotic diuresis and intravascular volume contraction [^111GiDN8] [^115vuKj5] [^1171fWyr] [^114Gnmga].

> Wait, let me verify typical clinical effects relevant to water balance: SGLT2 inhibitors commonly increase urine output and thirst and can cause volume depletion or hypotension due to osmotic diuresis and mild natriuresis; these effects are well described in regulatory labeling for dapagliflozin and empagliflozin and are mechanistically consistent with increased distal solute delivery and diuresis [^115vuKj5] [^117Mc6X3] [^1126M7YC].

> Next, I should review core CDI physiology and standard care to anchor the comparison: CDI (AVP deficiency) causes hypotonic polyuria from impaired water reabsorption in the collecting duct, with compensatory polydipsia and risk of hypernatremia if access to water or thirst is impaired, and the pharmacologic mainstay is desmopressin (DDAVP), an AVP analog, per FDA labeling and endocrine guidance [^115wxFGn] [^116Tfjqu] [^113cTPrj] [^117T8Yan] [^114NnP5Z].

> Hold on, I should verify diagnostic standards because this becomes crucial when SGLT2s are in play: classical testing relies on water deprivation with subsequent desmopressin response, and more recently, hypertonic-saline–stimulated copeptin thresholds have shown high accuracy for differentiating CDI from primary polydipsia and partial forms, which can reduce misclassification when urine indices are equivocal [^117T8Yan] [^111SE5FU] [^11292txb].

> I will now examine whether dapagliflozin can mask CDI features; there are multiple case reports describing that SGLT2-mediated glycosuria artificially raises urine specific gravity or osmolality enough to obscure the hallmark hypotonic polyuria, delaying CDI diagnosis until the drug is held, with a representative case demonstrating confirmation of CDI 48 hours after dapagliflozin cessation followed by successful desmopressin therapy and explicit recommendation to discontinue SGLT2 inhibitors when CDI is suspected or diagnosed [^1179DiTa] [^114KaAKJ] [^115mfVgK].

> Hmm, wait a minute — at first glance, a higher urine specific gravity while on dapagliflozin might seem to argue against CDI; but wait, that would be a mistake because the "concentration" is driven by glucosuria and osmotic diuresis rather than AVP-mediated water reabsorption, so urine may appear less hypotonic even when collecting duct water permeability remains impaired in CDI, meaning SGLT2s can elevate specific gravity and modestly increase urine osmolality while still worsening polyuria and diagnostic ambiguity [^111GiDN8] [^1179DiTa] [^11292txb].

> Let me consider safety next, because I need to ensure recommendations won't worsen outcomes: CDI already predisposes to hypernatremia during limited access to water or impaired thirst, and SGLT2-associated osmotic diuresis and volume contraction may further increase free-water losses and orthostatic symptoms, so continuing dapagliflozin in unrecognized CDI plausibly aggravates hypernatremia and dehydration risk even as urine indices appear "less dilute" on paper [^115vuKj5] [^117Mc6X3] [^111MuVEz].

> I should double-check practical management steps when CDI is suspected in a patient on dapagliflozin: the prudent approach, supported by case evidence and pathophysiology, is to discontinue SGLT2 therapy, allow a washout of roughly 24–48 hours before water deprivation or copeptin-based testing to unmask hypotonic polyuria, and then proceed with standard diagnostic algorithms and initiation of desmopressin with close sodium and volume monitoring [^1179DiTa] [^114KaAKJ] [^111SE5FU] [^117T8Yan].

> Next, I should review how to initiate or adjust desmopressin safely once CDI is confirmed, because rapid overcorrection or undercorrection is dangerous: use desmopressin per labeling with individualized dosing and fluid restriction guidance, apply Society for Endocrinology inpatient protocols for fluid optimization first, administer parenteral AVP analogs in unstable inpatients as needed, and correct hypernatremia within recommended limits to avoid osmotic injury, repeating desmopressin when dilute diuresis recurs to prevent rebound shifts [^1166735F] [^1114MGq6] [^113bhs7q] [^111MuVEz] [^114QtFh7].

> But wait, what if glycemic control is also needed while SGLT2 is held? Let me think about safer interim strategies: alternative antihyperglycemics without osmotic diuresis effects can be used short term while the CDI workup proceeds, with SGLT2 reconsideration only after CDI is stabilized and with explicit awareness that resumption may again confound urine indices and contribute to volume loss, warranting vigilant monitoring of fluid status and sodium if ever reintroduced in selected cases with compelling cardiorenal indications [^1171fWyr] [^114Gnmga] [^115vuKj5].

> I need to ensure diagnostic rigor going forward: in patients on SGLT2 inhibitors, interpret urine specific gravity and osmolality cautiously, prioritize serum sodium, total urine volume, and stimulated copeptin testing for differentiation, and, when in doubt, temporarily stop the SGLT2 to avoid a false-negative impression of DI due to glycosuria-driven "pseudo-concentration" before formal testing [^111SE5FU] [^117T8Yan] [^1179DiTa].

> In summary, I should confirm the bottom line: dapagliflozin is not a treatment for CDI, may mask its classic hypotonic urine signature via glycosuria and osmotic diuresis, can exacerbate volume depletion risks, and should be discontinued when CDI is suspected or diagnosed to permit accurate testing and timely initiation of desmopressin-based therapy with careful sodium and fluid management [^115vuKj5] [^1179DiTa] [^115wxFGn] [^114hdhn2].

Dapagliflozin is **not recommended** for central diabetes insipidus (CDI) because it increases osmotic diuresis and can worsen polyuria, dehydration, and hypernatremia [^115vuKj5]. There is no evidence that dapagliflozin reduces urine output or improves CDI symptoms, and it may mask hypotonic polyuria and delay diagnosis [^114KaAKJ] [^1179DiTa]. Desmopressin remains the **standard therapy**, and dapagliflozin should be avoided in these patients.

---

## Mechanism of action of dapagliflozin

Dapagliflozin inhibits SGLT2✱* in the proximal renal tubules, reducing glucose reabsorption and increasing urinary glucose excretion, causing osmotic diuresis and natriuresis [^111GiDN8] [^113ifqV2]. This mechanism is beneficial in T2DM but can increase urine output and dehydration risk in CDI [^115vuKj5].

---

## Pathophysiology of central diabetes insipidus

CDI is characterized by **AVP deficiency**, leading to impaired water reabsorption, large volumes of dilute urine, and compensatory polydipsia [^114NnP5Z] [^11292txb]. Standard treatment is **desmopressin**, a vasopressin analog that reduces urine output and concentrates urine [^115wxFGn].

---

## Potential therapeutic rationale for dapagliflozin in CDI

There is **no clear therapeutic rationale** for dapagliflozin in CDI. Its osmotic diuresis could worsen polyuria and dehydration, and there is no evidence that it reduces urine output or improves CDI symptoms.

---

## Clinical evidence and case reports

Limited clinical evidence suggests dapagliflozin is **not beneficial** in CDI and may worsen symptoms. Case reports include a patient with T2DM and CDI who developed persistent hypernatremia and polyuria after dapagliflozin initiation, with symptoms improving after the medication was discontinued and desmopressin started [^114KaAKJ]. Another report noted that SGLT2 inhibitors can mask hypotonic polyuria, complicating CDI diagnosis and management [^115mfVgK]. Together, these reports indicate dapagliflozin **may exacerbate polyuria**, dehydration, and hypernatremia in CDI [^1179DiTa].

---

## Safety concerns and adverse effects

Dapagliflozin use in CDI raises **significant safety concerns**:

- **Osmotic diuresis**: Increased urine output and dehydration risk [^115vuKj5].
- **Hypernatremia**: Worsening sodium imbalance due to fluid loss [^114NnP5Z].
- **Delayed diagnosis**: Masking of hypotonic polyuria, complicating diagnosis and management [^1179DiTa].

---

## Comparison with standard treatments

Desmopressin is the **standard treatment** for CDI, effectively reducing urine output and concentrating urine [^116Tfjqu]. Dapagliflozin does not address the underlying AVP deficiency and may worsen symptoms, making it **inferior to desmopressin**.

---

## Current clinical guidelines and expert opinions

Current guidelines and expert opinions **do not recommend** dapagliflozin for CDI. Desmopressin remains the **standard therapy**, and dapagliflozin should be avoided due to potential adverse effects and lack of evidence for efficacy.

---

## Ongoing clinical trials or research studies

There are **no known ongoing clinical trials** or research studies investigating dapagliflozin for CDI. The limited available evidence suggests it is not beneficial and may be harmful in this population.

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Dapagliflozin is **not recommended for CDI** due to its osmotic diuresis, which can worsen polyuria, dehydration, and hypernatremia [^115vuKj5]. There is no evidence that it reduces urine output or improves CDI symptoms, and it may mask hypotonic polyuria, delaying diagnosis [^114KaAKJ]. Desmopressin remains the **standard therapy**, and dapagliflozin should be avoided in CDI [^115wxFGn].

### SGLT2 inhibitor in a type 2 diabetes mellitus patient coexisted with central diabetes insipidus following hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state [^114KaAKJ]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2025). Low credibility.

CDI is characterized by hypotonic polyuria due to impaired vasopressin physiology, often accompanied by hypernatremia and hyperosmolality if fluid losses are not adequately replaced. Discriminating CDI from primary polydipsia can be challenging. A water deprivation test remains a valuable tool for differential diagnosis. In this case, polyuria was not initially associated with hypotonic urine (maximum specific urine gravity: 1.018) while the patient was on dapagliflozin. However, two days after discontinuing dapagliflozin, hypotonic polyuria became evident, and a water deprivation test confirmed CDI, showing an increase in urine specific gravity from 1.005 to 1.010 and urine osmolality from 19 to 86 mOsm/kg.

Several intriguing features were observed in this patient. During her second admission, she presented with hypernatremia without thirst, but by her third admission, she developed significant polydipsia (up to 10 L/day). This transient adipsia may have resulted from temporary damage to thirst-regulating neurons and osmoreceptors due to hypovolemia, which resolved over time. Additionally, the osmotic diuresis caused by poorly controlled diabetes and the use of SGLT2 inhibitors likely exacerbated her polydipsia and polyuria. SGLT2 inhibitors reduce glucose and sodium reabsorption in the proximal tubule, contributing to osmotic diuresis. A similar case was reported in a patient with adipsic CDI following traumatic brain injury, where empagliflozin obscured low urine osmolality (a relatively high urine osmolality: 529 mOsm/kg) and partially attenuated the antidiuretic effect.

### New developments and concepts in the diagnosis and management of diabetes insipidus (AVP-deficiency and resistance) [^11292txb]. Journal of Neuroendocrinology (2023). Low credibility.

Diabetes insipidus (DI) is a disorder characterized by the excretion of large amounts of hypotonic urine, with a prevalence of 1 per 25,000 population. Central DI (CDI), better now referred to as arginine vasopressin (AVP)-deficiency, is the most common form of DI, resulting from a deficiency of the hormone AVP from the pituitary. The less common nephrogenic DI (NDI), or AVP-resistance, develops secondary to AVP resistance in the kidneys.

The majority of causes of DI are acquired, with CDI developing when more than 80% of AVP-secreting neurons are damaged. Inherited/familial CDI causes account for approximately 1% of cases. Although the pathogenesis of NDI is unclear, more than 280 disease-causing mutations affecting the AVP2 protein or AVP V2 receptor, as well as aquaporin 2 (AQP2), have been described. While the cAMP/protein kinase A pathway remains the major regulatory pathway of AVP/AQP2 action, in vitro data have also revealed additional cAMP independent pathways of NDI pathogenesis.

Diagnosing partial forms of DI and distinguishing them from primary polydipsia can be challenging, previously necessitating the use of the water deprivation test. However, measurements of circulating copeptin levels, especially after stimulation, are increasingly replacing the classical tests in clinical practice because of their ease of use and high sensitivity and specificity. The treatment of CDI relies on desmopressin administration, whereas NDI requires the management of any underlying diseases, removal of offending drugs, and in some cases, administration of diuretics.

### Sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors in the treatment of diabetes mellitus: Cardiovascular and kidney effects, potential mechanisms, and clinical applications [^113ifqV2]. Circulation (2016). Low credibility.

Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, including empagliflozin, dapagliflozin, and canagliflozin, are now widely approved antihyperglycemic therapies. Owing to their unique glycosuric mechanism, SGLT2 inhibitors also contribute to weight reduction. More important, perhaps, are the osmotic diuretic and natriuretic effects, which contribute to plasma volume contraction and decrease systolic and diastolic blood pressures by 4 to 6 and 1 to 2 mmHg, respectively. These effects may underlie their cardiovascular and kidney benefits.

Additionally, SGLT2 inhibition is associated with an acute, dose-dependent reduction in estimated glomerular filtration rate by approximately 5 mL·min⁻¹·1.73 m⁻² and a 30% to 40% reduction in albuminuria. These effects reflect preclinical observations suggesting that proximal tubular natriuresis activates renal tubuloglomerular feedback through increased delivery of sodium and chloride to the macula densa, leading to afferent vasoconstriction. Based on reduced glomerular filtration, the glycosuric and weight loss effects are attenuated in patients with chronic kidney disease (estimated glomerular filtration rate < 60 mL·min⁻¹·1.73 m⁻²). In contrast, blood pressure-lowering, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and albuminuric effects are preserved, and may even be exaggerated, in cases of chronic kidney disease.

Regarding long-term clinical outcomes, the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial (Empagliflozin, Cardiovascular Outcomes, and Mortality in Type 2 Diabetes) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and established cardiovascular disease randomly assigned to empagliflozin versus placebo reported a 14% reduction.

Regarding quality improvement for arginine vasopressin deficiency, specifically in relation to hospital requirements, the SE 2018 guidelines recommend the development of alert systems in hospitals and other care facilities. These systems aim to identify all inpatients requiring ongoing treatment with desmopressin to reduce harm from medication errors, including missed prescribing, incorrect prescribing, and failures in dispensing or administration.

### Interaction between the sodium-glucose-linked transporter 2 inhibitor dapagliflozin and the loop diuretic bumetanide in normal human subjects [^114fy2vr]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

The modest natriuresis with dapagliflozin in euglycemic subjects is consistent with prior studies in normal subjects. However, dapagliflozin increased glycosuria significantly, suggesting enhanced delivery of fluid and Na+ out of the proximal tubule that should have increased reabsorption in the loop of Henle by the Na+/K+/2Cl, which is load dependent. Any increased Na+ delivery from the proximal tubule was likely modest because natriuresis with the first dose of dapagliflozin was not enhanced by blockade of Na+/K+/2Cl with bumetanide. Similarly, blockade of Na+ reabsorption in the proximal tubule by acetazolamide caused only a minor first‐dose additive increase in Na+ excretion with furosemide. We conclude that there is no significant additive natriuresis with dapagliflozin and bumetanide on first administration. However, there is an adaptive natriuresis over one week that is reminiscent of the synergy between loop and thiazide diuretics in subjects adapted to loop diuretics. Interestingly, despite rather modest natriuresis, administration of dapagliflozin to patients with T2DM reduced the blood volume, whereas treatment with a thiazide was not effective. It is possible that the relatively better volume‐depleting effects of dapagliflozin were attributable to volume loss without an increase in renin.

### XigduoXR [^115vuKj5]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Dapagliflozin, used in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus, can lead to various adverse reactions.

- **Volume depletion**: Dapagliflozin causes an osmotic diuresis, which may lead to a reduction in intravascular volume. Adverse reactions related to volume depletion, including reports of dehydration, hypovolemia, orthostatic hypotension, or hypotension, were observed in the 12-trial and 13-trial, short-term, placebo-controlled pools, and the DECLARE trial [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

- **Hypoglycemia**: The frequency of hypoglycemia in adult patients by trial is detailed in Table 5 [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. Hypoglycemia was more frequent when dapagliflozin was added to sulfonylurea or insulin [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. In the DECLARE trial [see Clinical Studies (14.3)], severe hypoglycemic events occurred in 58 (0.7%) out of 8574 adult patients treated with dapagliflozin 10 mg compared to 83 (1.0%) out of 8569 adult patients treated with placebo.

- **Genital mycotic infections**: In glycemic control trials in adults, genital mycotic infections were more common with dapagliflozin treatment. They were reported in 0.9% of patients on placebo, 5.7% on dapagliflozin 5 mg, and 4.8% on dapagliflozin 10 mg, in the 12-trial placebo-controlled pool. Discontinuation due to genital infection occurred in 0% of placebo-treated patients and 0.2% of patients treated with dapagliflozin 10 mg. Infections were more frequently reported in females than in males (see Table 3). The most frequently reported genital mycotic infections were vulvovaginal mycotic infections.

### Desmopressin acetate [^115wxFGn]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Desmopressin acetate injection is indicated as antidiuretic replacement therapy in the management of central (cranial) diabetes insipidus and for the management of the temporary polyuria and polydipsia following head trauma or surgery in the pituitary region.

- **Limitations of use**: Desmopressin acetate is ineffective and not indicated for the treatment of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus.

Desmopressin acetate injection is indicated for patients with hemophilia A with factor VIII coagulant activity levels greater than 5% without factor VIII antibodies to maintain hemostasis during surgical procedures and postoperatively. It is also indicated to reduce bleeding during episodes of spontaneous or traumatic injuries such as hemarthroses, intramuscular hematomas, or mucosal bleeding.

Desmopressin acetate injection is indicated for patients with mild to moderate von Willebrand's disease (Type I) with factor VIII levels greater than 5% to maintain hemostasis during surgical procedures and postoperatively. It is also indicated to reduce bleeding during episodes of spontaneous or traumatic injuries such as hemarthroses, intramuscular hematomas, or mucosal bleeding.

- **Limitations of use**: Desmopressin acetate is not indicated for the treatment of severe von Willebrand's disease (Type I) and when there is evidence of an abnormal molecular form of factor VIII antigen [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

### Diagnosis and management of central diabetes insipidus in adults [^114NnP5Z]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Low credibility.

Central diabetes insipidus (CDI) is a clinical syndrome resulting from loss or impaired function of vasopressinergic neurons in the hypothalamus/posterior pituitary, leading to impaired synthesis and/or secretion of arginine vasopressin (AVP). AVP deficiency causes an inability to concentrate urine and excessive renal water losses, resulting in a clinical syndrome of hypotonic polyuria with compensatory thirst. Although CDI is caused by diverse etiologies, it typically develops due to neoplastic, traumatic, or autoimmune destruction of AVP-synthesizing/secreting neurons. This review focuses on the diagnosis and management of CDI, providing insights into the physiological disturbances underpinning the syndrome.

Recent developments in diagnostic techniques, particularly the development of the copeptin assay, have improved the accuracy and acceptability of the diagnostic approach to the hypotonic polyuria syndrome. We discuss the management of CDI with particular emphasis on the management of fluid intake and pharmacological replacement of AVP. Specific clinical syndromes, such as adipsic diabetes insipidus and diabetes insipidus in pregnancy, as well as the management of the perioperative patient with diabetes insipidus, are also discussed.

### Xigduoxr [^111GiDN8]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Mechanism of action**:

	- **Dapagliflozin**: Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2), expressed in the proximal renal tubules, is responsible for the majority of the reabsorption of filtered glucose from the tubular lumen. Dapagliflozin is an inhibitor of SGLT2. By inhibiting SGLT2, dapagliflozin reduces reabsorption of filtered glucose and thereby promotes urinary glucose excretion. Additionally, dapagliflozin reduces sodium reabsorption and increases the delivery of sodium to the distal tubule. This may influence several physiological functions including, but not restricted to, lowering both pre- and afterload of the heart, downregulation of sympathetic activity, and decreased intraglomerular pressure, which is believed to be mediated by increased tubuloglomerular feedback.

	- **Metformin HCl**: Metformin is an antihyperglycemic agent which improves glucose tolerance in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, lowering both basal and postprandial plasma glucose. It decreases hepatic glucose production, decreases intestinal absorption of glucose, and improves insulin sensitivity by increasing peripheral glucose uptake and utilization. With metformin therapy, insulin secretion remains unchanged, while fasting insulin levels and day-long plasma insulin response may decrease.

- **Pharmacodynamics**:

	- **General**: Increases in the amount of glucose excreted in the urine were observed in healthy subjects and in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus following the administration of dapagliflozin. Dapagliflozin doses of 5 or 10 mg per day in patients with type 2 diabetes have shown these effects.

### Ddavp [^116Tfjqu]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

- **Indications and usage**: DDAVP tablets are indicated as antidiuretic replacement therapy in the management of central diabetes insipidus and for the management of the temporary polyuria and polydipsia following head trauma or surgery in the pituitary region. DDAVP is ineffective for the treatment of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Patients were selected for therapy based on the diagnosis by means of the water deprivation test, the hypertonic saline infusion test, and/or response to antidiuretic hormone. Continued response to DDAVP can be monitored by measuring urine volume and osmolality.

- **Primary nocturnal enuresis**: DDAVP tablets are indicated for the management of primary nocturnal enuresis. DDAVP may be used alone or as an adjunct to behavioral conditioning or other non-pharmacologic interventions.

### Sglt2 inhibitor in a type 2 diabetes mellitus patient coexisted with central diabetes insipidus following hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state [^115mfVgK]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2025). Low credibility.

- **Figure 1**: Magnetic resonance imaging scan of the pituitary in sagittal view (A, B) and contrast-enhanced in coronal view (C, D), conducted at the first month (A, C) and six months (B, D) since abortion. Both A and B showed an absence of posterior pituitary bright spot on the T1-weighted images. C showed slight pituitary hyperplasia in response to estrogen stimulation and recovered later (D).

As her gastrointestinal function improved, increased food intake led to a 5 kg weight gain (body weight: 80 kg) and worsening glycemic control despite higher insulin doses. Dapagliflozin (10 mg daily) was added to her regimen at a local hospital to address obesity and hyperglycemia. Shortly after initiating dapagliflozin, she developed progressive thirst and polydipsia, with a daily fluid intake of up to 10 L (Fig. 2). Notably, her hypernatremia resolved during this period. She was readmitted to our endocrinology department for evaluation of hyperglycemia, polydipsia, and polyuria. Her HbA1C had risen to 13.6%, and random blood glucose was 36.07 mmol/L with negative urinary ketones. Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) was initiated to optimize glycemic control. Urine specific gravity, measured every three hours, fluctuated between 1.008 and 1.018, with a total 24-hour urine output of 7.45 L. The maximum urine specific gravity exceeded 1.015, which was inconsistent with the expected low specific gravity (< 1.015) in diabetes insipidus. We hypothesized that the hypotonic polyuria characteristic of diabetes insipidus was masked by excessive urinary glucose excretion.

### Sglt2 inhibitor in a type 2 diabetes mellitus patient coexisted with central diabetes insipidus following hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state [^1179DiTa]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2025). High credibility.

Central diabetes insipidus (CDI) is a rare complication following a hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state (HHS) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The coexistence of T2DM and CDI can lead to diagnostic challenges, particularly when the patients present with persistent hypernatremia without a sense of thirst.

- **Case presentation**: This case report describes a young woman with T2DM and HHS who developed persistent hypernatremia without thirst. The diagnosis of CDI was delayed until she exhibited polydipsia, consuming up to 10 liters of water per day, following the administration of dapagliflozin for glucose control. Initially, the low specific gravity of urine was not evident during dapagliflozin treatment. However, after discontinuing dapagliflozin for 48 hours, CDI was confirmed through a water deprivation test, which revealed polyuria with low urine specific gravity and osmolality. The patient was successfully treated with oral desmopressin.

- **Conclusions**: This case highlights that SGLT2 inhibitors, such as dapagliflozin, may accelerate polyuria and alter urine osmolality by inhibiting glucose and sodium reabsorption in the proximal tubule. Therefore, it is crucial to discontinue SGLT2 inhibitors when CDI is suspected or diagnosed.

### Long-term efficacy of dapagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus receiving high doses of insulin: a randomized trial [^116UXkcX]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Dapagliflozin, a selective inhibitor of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2, may improve glycemic control with a lower dose of insulin and attenuate the associated weight gain in patients with inadequate control despite high doses of insulin.

- **Objective**: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of adding dapagliflozin therapy in patients whose type 2 diabetes mellitus is inadequately controlled with insulin, with or without oral antidiabetic drugs.

- **Design**: A 24-week, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial followed by a 24-week extension period. An additional 56-week extension period is ongoing (ClinicalTrials.gov registration number: NCT00673231).

- **Setting**: 126 centers in Europe and North America from 30 April 2008 to 19 November 2009.

- **Patients**: 808 patients with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus receiving at least 30 U of insulin daily, with or without up to 2 oral antidiabetic drugs.

- **Intervention**: Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1:1 ratio and allocated with a computer-generated scheme to receive placebo or 2.5, 5, or 10 mg of dapagliflozin, once daily, for 48 weeks.

- **Measurements**: The primary outcome was change in hemoglobin A(1c) from baseline to 24 weeks. Secondary outcomes included changes in body weight, insulin dose, and fasting plasma glucose level at 24 weeks and during the 24-week extension period. Adverse events were evaluated throughout both 24-week periods.

- **Results**: 800 patients were analyzed. After 24 weeks, mean hemoglobin A(1c) decreased by 0.79% to 0.96% with dapagliflozin compared with 0.39% with placebo.

### The efficacy and safety of sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors in real-world clinical practice: Potential cautionary use in elderly patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) [^114VoTgu]. Diabetes Therapy (2024). Low credibility.

Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have demonstrated safety and therapeutic efficacy in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for reducing adverse cardiorenal events in high-risk patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). This study investigated the efficacy and safety of SGLT2 intervention in patients with T2D in real-world clinical practice to validate the results of prior RCTs.

- **Methods**: As a retrospective study, we evaluated medical records from 596 patients with T2D treated with SGLT2 inhibitors (dapagliflozin or empagliflozin) alongside their prior drug regimen to improve glucose control between 2015 and 2019 at the Endocrinology Department of Chungbuk National University Hospital. No control arm was used to compare the effects of adding SGLT2 inhibitors to the pre-existing regimen. The primary objective was the measurement of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) from each patient over 36 months at 6-month intervals. Secondary parameters included fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and body weight (Bwt) changes, monitoring of adverse events (AEs), and determining reasons for drug discontinuation.

- **Results**: HbA1c levels were reduced at each time point throughout the 36-month period and showed a significant reduction of 12.5% (P < 0.01) from time 0 (8.8 ± 1.3%) to 36 months (7.7 ± 1.0%). FPG levels (from baseline 180 ± 60 mg/dL to 36 months 138 ± 38 mg/dL) and Bwt (from baseline 74 ± 15 kg to 36 months 72 ± 15 kg) were also significantly reduced (P < 0.01) for both measurements in the SGLT2 inhibitor add-on group.

### Society for Endocrinology clinical guidance: Inpatient management of cranial diabetes insipidus [^113bhs7q]. Endocrine Connections (2018). High credibility.

For the medical management of arginine vasopressin deficiency, particularly concerning desmopressin, the Society for Endocrinology 2018 guidelines recommend administering IV or IM vasopressin at doses of 1–2 mcg in patients with known central diabetes insipidus and excessive, inappropriately dilute urine output. This should be accompanied by close observation of the clinical and biochemical response.

### Efficacy and safety of dapagliflozin plus saxagliptin versus insulin glargine over 52 weeks as add-on to metformin with or without sulphonylurea in patients with type 2 diabetes: A randomized, parallel-design, open-label, Phase 3 trial [^116tNFjg]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2020). High credibility.

The study was conducted according to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice guidelines of the International Conference on Harmonisation and approved by the relevant institutional review boards or independent ethics committees. All participants provided informed consent for both the short‐ and long‐term study periods prior to inclusion.

Adult male or female patients (age ≥ 18 years) with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and inadequate glycaemic control (HbA1c ≥ 8% to ≤ 12%), who were on stable metformin therapy (≥ 1500 mg/day) with or without sulphonylurea (≥ 50% of the maximal dose) for at least 8 weeks before screening, were deemed eligible. Participants needed to have a body mass index (BMI) ≤ 45.0 kg/m² at screening and baseline fasting plasma glucose (FPG) ≤ 270 mg/dL. Major exclusion criteria included type 1 diabetes, maturity‐onset diabetes of the young, secondary diabetes, diabetes insipidus, a history of diabetic ketoacidosis, or renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 60 mL/min and serum creatinine ≥ 1.5 mg/dL in men or ≥ 1.4 mg/dL in women).

Participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio using an interactive voice response system. This was stratified by sulphonylurea use with background metformin treatment to receive either a combination of dapagliflozin and saxagliptin (DAPA + SAXA) or insulin glargine (INS) for 24 weeks with a long-term extension.

### Antidiuretic effect of hydrochlorothiazide in lithium-induced nephrogenic diabetes insipidus is associated with upregulation of aquaporin-2, Na-Cl co-transporter, and epithelial sodium channel [^116gj9Nd]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2004). Low credibility.

Thiazides have been used in patients with nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) to decrease urine volume, but the mechanism by which they produce the paradoxical antidiuretic effect remains unclear. Previous studies have reported that the downregulation of aquaporin-2 (AQP2) is important for the development of lithium-induced (Li-induced) polyuria and that hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) increases renal papillary osmolality and Na(+) concentration in Brattleboro rats.

To elucidate the molecular basis of the antidiuretic action of HCTZ in diabetes insipidus, this study investigated whether the administration of HCTZ affects the expression of AQP2 and major renal Na(+) transporters in Li-induced NDI rats, using semiquantitative immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry. After feeding male Sprague-Dawley rats a Li chloride-containing rat diet for four weeks, HCTZ or vehicle was infused subcutaneously via an osmotic minipump. Urine output was significantly decreased by HCTZ treatment, whereas it did not change in vehicle-treated rats. Urine osmolality was also higher in HCTZ-treated rats than in vehicle-treated rats.

Semiquantitative immunoblotting using whole-kidney homogenates revealed that HCTZ treatment caused a significant partial recovery in AQP2 abundance from Li-induced downregulation. AQP2 immunohistochemistry showed compatible findings with the immunoblot results in both the cortex and medulla. The abundances of the thiazide-sensitive NaCl co-transporter and alpha-epithelial sodium channel were increased by HCTZ treatment. Notably, HCTZ treatment induced a shift in the molecular weight of the gamma-epithelial sodium channel.

### GLP-1 receptor agonists may enhance the effects of desmopressin in individuals with AVP deficiency: A case series and proposed mechanism [^114K7dTU]. Pituitary (2024). Low credibility.

Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) plays a multifaceted role in maintaining sodium and water homeostasis in humans. In the brain, GLP-1 directly modulates thirst perception and leads to decreased water intake. It is also thought to directly inhibit arginine vasopressin (AVP) production. Additionally, in the gut, GLP-1 reduces sodium absorption, while in the kidney, GLP-1 exerts a natriuretic effect and can potentially enhance renal hemodynamics.

The viability of GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) as a potential treatment for primary polydipsia has received attention recently. Winzeler et al. presented evidence suggesting the potential of GLP-1 RAs as a viable therapeutic option for primary polydipsia. Patients with primary polydipsia who were administered dulaglutide, a GLP-1 RA, showed a significant reduction in fluid intake and thirst perception compared to those who received a placebo.

AVP deficiency (AVP-D), also known as central diabetes insipidus, is another cause of polyuria-polydipsia syndrome. This condition is characterized by hypotonic polyuria (50 ml/kg body weight per 24 hours) and polydipsia (> 3 L per day). Desmopressin is the primary treatment for AVP-D, targeting AVP receptor 2 to improve excessive urination and thirst.

In this report, we present three patients diagnosed with AVP-D who required a reduction in their desmopressin dosage following the initiation of GLP-1 RA. We propose a hypothesis to explain why desmopressin's antidiuretic effect may be increased when combined with GLP-1 RA.

### Effects of salt and protein intake on polyuria in V2RA-treated ADPKD patients [^116YaMvG]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Low credibility.

In subjects with debilitating polyuria due to central or nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI), it is generally advised to lower osmolar intake to decrease urinary volume. The mechanism by which a V2 receptor antagonist (V2RA) causes polyuria is very similar to the pathophysiology of NDI. In NDI, the collecting duct is relatively impermeable to water due to insensitivity to vasopressin, caused either by defects in the V2 receptor (V2R) or defects downstream. V2RAs cause a similar effect by competitively binding to the V2R and inhibiting vasopressin.

Animal experiments use treatment with tolvaptan to simulate NDI because of these similarities in pathophysiology. Consequently, we hypothesized that the influence of osmotic load on urinary volume in V2RA treatment was equivalent to that observed in NDI. In a study involving patients with complete nephrogenic or central diabetes insipidus, a decrease in osmolar intake of –724.6 mOsm/24-hour resulted in a decrease in urine volume of –3.7 L/24-hour. Our study observed a decrease in osmolar excretion of –344 mOsm/24-hour leading to a urine volume reduction of –0.7 L/24-hour, indicating the effect is 2 to 3 times less.

### Changing the name of diabetes insipidus: A position statement of the working group for renaming diabetes insipidus [^112rfBhP]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Low credibility.

There are multiple reasons to change the name of diabetes insipidus at this time. First and foremost, although the terms mellitus and insipidus do differentiate between the clinical characteristics of these two very different causes of polyuria, the use of the common term "diabetes" in both has unfortunately led to confusion for both patients and their caretakers. This confusion with diabetes mellitus has been to the detriment of patients with diabetes insipidus when they are under the care of non-endocrine specialists. Some physicians and nurses do not appreciate the difference between these two disorders. In several patients with central diabetes insipidus, desmopressin treatment was withheld, resulting in serious adverse outcomes, including death. This has led to high-profile litigation cases and coroners' inquests involving the police, with broad media coverage.

Subsequent to these unfortunate but avoidable cases, national safety alerts, surveys among endocrinologists, and a global taskforce consisting of a wide range of senior clinicians involved with the care of patients with diabetes insipidus have led to a strong impetus to change the name of the condition. Second, patients with diabetes insipidus strongly support the name change to eliminate "diabetes". In a survey of over 1000 patients with central diabetes insipidus recently published in The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology, 85% preferred the name to be changed, mainly due to experiences with insufficient understanding of the condition.

### Diagnosing and treating the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion [^114oZizi]. The American Journal of Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

The syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion is the most common cause of hyponatremia in clinical practice. Management of hyponatremia and outcomes in patients with this syndrome are not well understood. The objective of the Hyponatremia Registry was to assess the state of management of hyponatremia due to this condition in diverse hospital settings. Specifically, it examined which diagnostic and treatment modalities are currently used and how rapidly and reliably they result in an increase in serum sodium concentration ([Na⁺]). A secondary objective was to determine whether treatment choices and outcomes differ across the United States and the European Union.

- **Methods**: The Hyponatremia Registry recorded selected diagnostic measures and use, efficacy, and outcomes of therapy for euvolemic hyponatremia diagnosed clinically as the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion in 1,524 adult patients with [Na⁺] ≤ 130 mEq/L (1,034 from 146 US sites and 490 from 79 EU sites). A subgroup of patients with more rigorously defined syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion, via measurement of relevant laboratory parameters, was also analyzed.

- **Results**: The most common monotherapy treatments for hyponatremia in patients with this syndrome were fluid restriction (48%), isotonic (27%) or hypertonic (6%) saline, and tolvaptan (13%); 11% received no active agent. The mean rate of [Na⁺] change (mEq/L/d) was greater for a

### Exploring the potential of the SGLT2 inhibitor dapagliflozin in type 1 diabetes: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study [^111DeHpm]. Diabetes Care (2015). High credibility.

Insulin adjustments to maintain glycemic control in individuals with type 1 diabetes often lead to wide glucose fluctuations, hypoglycemia, and increased body weight. Dapagliflozin, an insulin-independent sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, increases glucosuria and reduces hyperglycemia in individuals with type 2 diabetes. The primary objective of this study was to assess the short-term safety of dapagliflozin in combination with insulin. Secondary objectives included pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and efficacy parameters.

- **Research design and methods**: A 2-week, dose-ranging, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled proof-of-concept study randomly assigned 70 adults with type 1 diabetes (HbA1c 7–10%), who were receiving treatment with stable doses of insulin, to one of four dapagliflozin doses (1, 2.5, 5, or 10 mg) or placebo. The insulin dose was not proactively reduced at randomization but could be adjusted for safety reasons.

- **Results**: Sixty-two patients (88.6%) completed the study. Any hypoglycemia was common across all treatments (60.0–92.3%); one major event of hypoglycemia occurred with dapagliflozin 10 mg. No diabetic ketoacidosis occurred. Pharmacokinetic parameters were similar to those observed in patients with type 2 diabetes. Glucosuria increased by 88 g/24 h (95% CI 55 to 121) with dapagliflozin 10 mg and decreased by -21.5 g/24 h (95% CI -53.9 to 11.0) with placebo. Changes from baseline with dapagliflozin 10 mg by day 7 were as follows: -2.29 mmol/L (95% CI -3.71 to -0.87 [-41.3 mg/dL; 95% CI -66.9 to -15.7]) for 24-h daily average.

### Efficacy and safety of canagliflozin used in conjunction with sulfonylurea in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: A randomized, controlled trial [^113pYXN9]. Diabetes Therapy (2015). High credibility.

The observed additive glycemic effects of canagliflozin on top of sulfonylurea are anticipated on the basis of its complementary mechanism of action; while the efficacy of sulfonylurea is dependent on adequate pancreatic insulin-secretory capacity, this is not the case with the SGLT2 inhibitors. For this reason, it is hypothesized that canagliflozin will be an effective treatment choice at most stages of the disease, and in combination with other glucose-lowering therapies. The 300-mg dose of canagliflozin was associated with numerically greater effects on several parameters compared with the 100-mg dose, including a modest increase in the percentage of patients achieving a target HbA1c < 7.0% (placebo-subtracted differences of 28.3% vs. 20.0%, respectively).

We and others have previously reported that the additional efficacy effects of the 300-mg over the 100-mg dose were achieved at the expense of an increased risk of drug-related AEs. By contrast, osmotic diuresis-related effects (e.g. polyuria, pollakiuria, thirst) and volume-related AEs (e.g. postural dizziness, orthostatic hypotension, hypotension, syncope, presyncope) were similar in all treatment groups, with no difference between the two canagliflozin doses, almost certainly due to the much smaller study numbers. We should not, however, conclude that the combination of canagliflozin with a sulfonylurea provides a protective effect against these side effects, and identifying patients potentially susceptible to AEs will be an important component of a patient-centered approach to diabetes management.

### Glucuretic effects and renal safety of dapagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes [^113bqX1X]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

Dapagliflozin is a selective sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor approved as a treatment for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in the United States, the European Union, and other countries. Dapagliflozin increases renal glucose excretion in an insulin-independent manner, and its mechanism of action is complementary to those of other antidiabetes medications. When used as monotherapy or in combination with other oral antidiabetes medications or insulin, dapagliflozin improves glycemic measures in patients with T2DM. Dapagliflozin treatment is also associated with weight reduction and a decrease in blood pressure, both of which may be beneficial in patients with T2DM. Because of its mechanism of action, dapagliflozin has a low intrinsic propensity to cause hypoglycemia. Overall, dapagliflozin is well tolerated, with the frequency of most adverse events similar to that seen with placebo.

Cases of genital infections and, in some studies, urinary tract infections have been more frequent in dapagliflozin-treated groups compared with placebo groups. In the clinical development program, more cases of newly diagnosed bladder cancer were reported for patients treated with dapagliflozin (0.17%) compared with placebo or comparator (0.03%). Although there were not enough cases to determine causality, dapagliflozin should not be used in patients with bladder cancer and should be used with caution in patients with a history of bladder cancer. Dapagliflozin may decrease glomerular filtration rate (GFR), especially in elderly patients and patients with impaired renal function.

- **Recommended dosage**: Initiate fluid restriction during treatment with desmopressin acetate injection [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Use in Specific Populations (8.4, 8.5)].

	**Diabetes insipidus**:

	- **Treatment naïve patients**: The recommended starting daily dosage is 2 mcg to 4 mcg administered as one or two divided doses by subcutaneous or intravenous injection. Do not dilute desmopressin acetate injection for the diabetes insipidus population. The morning and evening doses should be separately adjusted for an adequate diurnal rhythm of water turnover. Adjust the dose based on response to treatment, estimated by two parameters: adequate duration of sleep and adequate, not excessive, water turnover.

	- **Patients changing from intranasal desmopressin**: The recommended starting dose of desmopressin acetate injection is 1/10th the daily maintenance intranasal dose, administered by subcutaneous or intravenous injection as one or two divided doses.

	**Hemophilia A and von Willebrand's Disease (Type I)**: The recommended dosage is 0.3 mcg/kg actual body weight (up to a maximum of 20 mcg) administered by intravenous infusion over 15 minutes to 30 minutes. If used preoperatively, administer 30 minutes prior to the procedure. If used to reduce spontaneous or traumatic bleeding, doses may be repeated after 8 to 12 hours and once daily thereafter, if needed, based upon clinical condition and von Willebrand factor and factor VIII levels. The necessity for repeat administration of desmopressin acetate or the use of any blood products for hemostasis should be determined by laboratory response.

Infrequently, large doses of the intranasal formulations of DDAVP and DDAVP injection have produced transient headache, nausea, flushing, and mild abdominal cramps. These symptoms have disappeared with a reduction in dosage.

- **Central diabetes insipidus**: In long-term clinical studies where patients with diabetes insipidus were followed for periods up to 44 months of DDAVP tablet therapy, transient increases in AST (SGOT) no higher than 1.5 times the upper limit of normal were occasionally observed. Elevated AST (SGOT) returned to the normal range despite continued use of DDAVP tablets.

- **Primary nocturnal enuresis**: The only adverse event occurring in ≥ 3% of patients in controlled clinical trials with DDAVP tablets that was probably, possibly, or remotely related to the study drug was headache (4% DDAVP, 3% placebo).

- **Other**: The following adverse events have been reported; however, their relationship to DDAVP has not been established: abnormal thinking, diarrhea, and edema-weight gain.

See WARNINGS for the possibility of water intoxication and hyponatremia. Post-marketing, there have been rare reports of hyponatremic convulsions associated with concomitant use with the following medications: oxybutinin and imipramine.

### Effect of dapagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes who have inadequate glycaemic control with metformin: A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^114F5Lfo]. Lancet (2010). Low credibility.

Correction of hyperglycaemia and prevention of glucotoxicity are important objectives in the management of type 2 diabetes. Dapagliflozin, a selective sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor, reduces renal glucose reabsorption in an insulin-independent manner. We assessed the efficacy and safety of dapagliflozin in patients who have inadequate glycaemic control with metformin.

- **Methods**: In this phase 3, multicentre, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled trial, 546 adults with type 2 diabetes who were receiving daily metformin (≥ 1500 mg per day) and had inadequate glycaemic control were randomly assigned to receive one of three doses of dapagliflozin (2.5 mg, n = 137; 5 mg, n = 137; or 10 mg, n = 135) or placebo (n = 137) orally once daily. Randomisation was computer generated and stratified by site, implemented with a central, telephone-based interactive voice response system. Patients continued to receive their pre-study metformin dosing. The primary outcome was change from baseline in haemoglobin A(1c) (HbA(1c)) at 24 weeks. All randomised patients who received at least one dose of double-blind study medication and who had both a baseline and at least one post-baseline measurement (last observation carried forward) were included in the analysis. Data were analysed by use of ANCOVA models. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00528879.

- **Findings**: 534 patients were included in analysis of the primary endpoint (dapagliflozin 2.5 mg, n = 135; dapagliflozin 5 mg, n = 133; dapagliflozin 10 mg, n = 132; placebo, n = 134). At week 24, mean HbA(1c)…

### Sodium-glucose cotransport inhibition with dapagliflozin in type 2 diabetes [^115czVqy]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Dapagliflozin, a novel inhibitor of renal sodium-glucose cotransporter 2, allows an insulin-independent approach to improve hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes. In this multiple-dose study, we evaluated the safety and efficacy of dapagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes. Patients were randomly assigned to one of five dapagliflozin doses, metformin XR, or placebo for 12 weeks. The primary objective was to compare the mean change from baseline in A1C. Other objectives included comparison of changes in fasting plasma glucose (FPG), weight, adverse events, and laboratory measurements.

After 12 weeks, dapagliflozin induced moderate glucosuria (52–85 g urinary glucose/day) and demonstrated significant glycemic improvements versus placebo with a DeltaA1C of -0.55 to -0.90% and DeltaFPG of -16 to -31 mg/dL. Weight loss compared to placebo was -1.3 to -2.0 kg. There was no change in renal function. Serum uric acid decreased, serum magnesium and phosphate increased at higher doses, and dose-related increases in 24-hour urine volume and hematocrit were observed, all of small magnitude. Treatment-emergent adverse events were similar across all groups.

Dapagliflozin improved hyperglycemia and facilitated weight loss in patients with type 2 diabetes by inducing controlled glucosuria with urinary loss of approximately 200–300 kcal/day. The treatment demonstrated no persistent, clinically significant changes in osmolarity, volume, or renal status.

### Dapagliflozin (SGLT2-i) induced euglycaemic diabetic ketoacidosis [^114z2CxV]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). Low credibility.

Sodium glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2-i) have become a popular therapeutic strategy in the management of hyperglycaemia in type 2 diabetes mellitus. The primary site of action of SGLT2-i is at the proximal renal convoluted tubule. They work by blocking SGLT2 receptors, sodium-dependent glucose co-transport molecules, which in turn prevents glucose reabsorption, facilitating glucosuria, improving glycaemic control as well as a moderate degree of weight loss. We report the case of a 51-year-old woman admitted to the acute medical unit with abdominal pain and vomiting, who was diagnosed with euglycaemic diabetic ketoacidosis secondary to the recent initiation of an SGLT2-i medication (dapagliflozin). Clinicians should be aware of this rare side effect of SGLT2-i to circumvent delays in patient management.

### Synjardy [^117Mc6X3]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Empagliflozin causes an osmotic diuresis, which may lead to intravascular volume contraction and adverse reactions related to volume depletion. In a pool of five placebo-controlled clinical trials in adults, adverse reactions related to volume depletion, such as decreased ambulatory blood pressure, decreased systolic blood pressure, dehydration, hypotension, hypovolemia, orthostatic hypotension, and syncope, were reported by 0.3%, 0.5%, and 0.3% of patients treated with placebo, empagliflozin 10 mg, and empagliflozin 25 mg, respectively. Empagliflozin may increase the risk of hypotension in patients at risk for volume contraction [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5, 8.6)].

In a pool of five placebo-controlled clinical trials in adults, adverse reactions of increased urination, such as polyuria, pollakiuria, and nocturia, occurred more frequently with empagliflozin than with placebo. Specifically, nocturia was reported by 0.4%, 0.3%, and 0.8% of patients treated with placebo, empagliflozin 10 mg, and empagliflozin 25 mg, respectively.

The incidence of hypoglycemia in adults by trial is shown in Table 3. The incidence of hypoglycemia increased when empagliflozin was administered with insulin or sulfonylurea.

Pemetrexed is an approved antimetabolite agent, now widely used for treating locally advanced or metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer. Although no electrolyte abnormalities are described in the prescribing information for this drug, several case reports have noted nephrogenic diabetes insipidus with associated acute kidney injury. We present a case of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus without severely reduced kidney function and propose a mechanism for the isolated finding.

### XigduoXR [^1171fWyr]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Out of 2906 (68%) patients who had type 2 diabetes mellitus at randomization, 1455 patients received dapagliflozin 10 mg and 1451 received a placebo. At baseline, among the patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, 43% were being treated with metformin HCl (631 patients on dapagliflozin 10 mg and 613 on placebo), and 55% were treated with insulin.

The mean age of the type 2 diabetes mellitus trial population was 64 years. Of this population, 67% were male, 53% White, 5% Black or African American, and 32% Asian. Additionally, 27% were of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. In these patients, mean eGFR was 44 mL/min/1.73 m²; 43% had an eGFR of 30 mL/min/1.73 m² to below 45 mL/min/1.73 m², and 14% had an eGFR below 30 mL/min/1.73 m². Median UACR was 1017 mg/g. The most common etiologies of CKD in this group were diabetic nephropathy (86%) and ischemic/hypertensive nephropathy (7%).

Dapagliflozin 10 mg reduced the incidence of the primary composite endpoint of ≥ 50% sustained decline in eGFR, progression to ESKD, CV or renal death in the overall population [HR 0.61 (95% CI 0.51, 0.72); p < 0.0001]. The dapagliflozin 10 mg and placebo event curves separated by Month 4 and continued to diverge over the trial period. The treatment effect reflected a reduction in ≥ 50% sustained decline in eGFR, progression to ESKD, and CV death. There were few renal deaths during the trial.

### Copeptin and its role in the diagnosis of diabetes insipidus and the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis [^117T8Yan]. Clinical Endocrinology (2019). Low credibility.

- **The role of copeptin in the differential diagnosis of diabetes insipidus**: Polyuria-polydipsia syndrome is a common problem in clinical practice, with the main entities being central or nephrogenic diabetes insipidus and primary polydipsia. Central diabetes insipidus is characterized by either a complete (complete central diabetes insipidus) or partial (partial central diabetes insipidus) insufficient vasopressin (AVP) secretion from the pituitary. Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, on the other hand, results from an AVP resistance in the kidneys, both leading to hypotonic polyuria with compensatory polydipsia.

	- Central diabetes insipidus can result from various conditions affecting the hypothalamic-neurohypophyseal system, such as trauma from surgery or accidents, local tumors or metastases, and inflammatory/autoimmune or granulomatous diseases. Several reports have described genetic defects in AVP synthesis, leading to inherited forms of central diabetes insipidus. The most challenging form involves an impairment of thirst perception and consecutive hypodipsia, which can result in severe hypernatremia.

	- Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus results from a lack of aquaporin 2 (AQP2)-mediated water reabsorption in the collecting duct. This can occur due to gene mutations in key proteins such as the vasopressin V2 receptor or AQP2, can be secondarily triggered by electrolyte disorders, or can be induced by certain drugs, especially lithium.

- **Clinical pharmacology**: DDAVP tablets contain desmopressin acetate as the active substance, which is a synthetic analogue of the natural hormone arginine vasopressin.

- **Central diabetes insipidus**: Dose response studies in patients with diabetes insipidus have demonstrated that oral doses ranging from 0.025 mg to 0.4 mg produce clinically significant antidiuretic effects. In most patients, doses of 0.1 mg to 0.2 mg produce optimal antidiuretic effects lasting up to eight hours. With doses of 0.4 mg, antidiuretic effects have been observed for up to 12 hours; measurements beyond 12 hours were not recorded. Increasing oral doses result in dose-dependent increases in the plasma levels of DDAVP (desmopressin acetate).

The plasma half-life of DDAVP follows a monoexponential time course with t₁/₂ values of 1.5 to 2.5 hours, which is independent of dose. The bioavailability of DDAVP oral tablets is about 5% compared to intranasal DDAVP, and about 0.16% compared to intravenous DDAVP. The time to reach maximum plasma DDAVP levels ranges from 0.9 to 1.5 hours following oral or intranasal administration, respectively. Following administration of DDAVP tablets, the onset of the antidiuretic effect occurs at around 1 hour, reaching a maximum at about 4 to 7 hours based on the measurement of increased urine osmolality.

Use of DDAVP tablets in patients with an established diagnosis will result in a reduction in urinary output with an accompanying increase in urine osmolality. These effects usually allow for the resumption of a more normal lifestyle, with a decrease in urinary frequency and nocturia.

### The management of central diabetes insipidus in infancy: Desmopressin, low renal solute load formula, thiazide diuretics [^116rkRr8]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2007). Low credibility.

Infants consume most of their calories as formula. Because of this large fluid intake, they normally produce dilute urine, similar to that seen in individuals with diabetes insipidus (DI). Infants with DI are therefore prone to water intoxication if fixed antidiuresis is achieved using the long-acting vasopressin analog desmopressin (DDAVP), which induces a state of high urine concentration.

DI treatment approaches used for older children and adults, who consume their calories as solids, are difficult to apply to infants with DI. In infants, oral and intranasal DDAVP can be associated with broad swings in serum sodium concentration (SNA). In comparison, precisely administered subcutaneous doses of DDAVP can be successfully used in infants with DI and appear to be superior to oral or intranasal DDAVP therapy.

- **Alternative treatment options**: Consistent eunatremia can be simply achieved in infantile DI using low renal solute load (RSL) formula and thiazide diuretics. Low RSL formula reduces obligatory urinary water losses, and thiazide diuretics concentrate the urine to levels seen in normal formula-fed infants.

This report addresses treatment options of DI in infancy and the delicate management issues involved.

### Dapagliflozin: A sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor in development for type 2 diabetes [^117Vu9UY]. Diabetes Therapy (2010). High credibility.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a growing worldwide epidemic. Patients face lifelong therapy to control hyperglycemia and prevent the associated complications. There are many medications, with varying mechanisms, available for the treatment of T2DM, but almost all target the declining insulin sensitivity and secretion that are associated with disease progression. Medications with such insulin-dependent mechanisms of action often lose efficacy over time, and there is increasing interest in developing new antidiabetes medications that are not dependent upon insulin. One such approach is through the inhibition of renal glucose reuptake. Dapagliflozin, the first of a class of selective sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors, reduces renal glucose reabsorption and is currently under development for the treatment of T2DM. Here, we review the literature relating to the preclinical and clinical development of dapagliflozin.

**Figure 1**: Mean (standard deviation) 24-hour sodium (A), glucose (B), volume (C) and fractional lithium excretion (D) at baseline, start of treatment, end of treatment, and follow-up of the DAPASALT trial participants. Fractional lithium excretion was more than two times the upper limit of normal in one participant at baseline, which could not be explained by concomitant use of medication or other circumstances. At four days, a large decrease in fractional lithium excretion was observed. The baseline lithium excretion in this participant was considered an outlying value, and the patient was removed from the fractional lithium excretion analysis.

### Diagnosis and management of diabetes insipidus for the internist: an update [^116DgybL]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Diabetes insipidus is a disorder characterized by the excretion of large amounts of hypotonic urine. Four entities must be differentiated:

- **Central diabetes insipidus**: Results from a deficiency of the hormone arginine vasopressin (AVP) in the pituitary gland or hypothalamus.
- **Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus**: Caused by resistance to AVP in the kidneys.
- **Gestational diabetes insipidus**: Results from an increase in placental vasopressinase.
- **Primary polydipsia**: Involves excessive intake of large amounts of water despite normal AVP secretion and action.

Distinguishing between the different types of diabetes insipidus can be challenging. A detailed medical history, physical examination, and imaging studies are necessary to detect the aetiology of the disorder. Differentiation between the various forms of hypotonic polyuria is then accomplished by the classical water deprivation test or the more recently developed hypertonic saline or arginine stimulation combined with copeptin (or AVP) measurement.

In patients with idiopathic central diabetes insipidus, close follow-up is necessary since central DI can be the first sign of an underlying pathology. Treatment of diabetes insipidus or primary polydipsia depends on the underlying aetiology and varies for central diabetes insipidus, nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, and primary polydipsia. This review discusses issues and the newest developments in diagnosis, differential diagnosis, and treatment, with a focus on central diabetes insipidus.

### Vasopressin-dependent disorders: What is new in children [^11319S3y]. Pediatrics (2021). Low credibility.

Arginine vasopressin (AVP)-mediated osmoregulatory disorders, such as diabetes insipidus (DI) and syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH), are common in the differential diagnosis for children with hypo- and hypernatremia. These disorders require timely recognition and treatment. DI results from a failure to concentrate urine due to impaired production of or response to AVP, leading to hypernatremia. Newer methods of diagnosing DI include measuring copeptin levels; copeptin is AVP's chaperone protein and serves as a surrogate biomarker of AVP secretion. Intraoperative copeptin levels may also help predict the risk for developing DI after neurosurgical procedures. Copeptin levels hold diagnostic promise in other pediatric conditions as well.

Recently, expanded genotype and phenotype correlations in inherited DI disorders have been described, which may better predict the clinical course in affected children and infants. Similarly, newer formulations of synthetic AVP may improve pediatric DI treatment. In contrast to DI, SIADH is characterized by inappropriate AVP secretion and commonly leads to severe hyponatremia. Contemporary methods aid clinicians in distinguishing SIADH from other hyponatremic conditions, particularly cerebral salt wasting. Further research on the efficacy of therapies for pediatric SIADH is needed, although some adult treatments hold promise for pediatrics. Lastly, the expansion of home point-of-care sodium testing may transform the management of SIADH and DI in children. In this article, we review recent developments in the understanding of pathophysiology related to these disorders.

### Effect of exenatide twice daily and dapagliflozin, alone and in combination, on markers of kidney function in obese patients with type 2 diabetes: A prespecified secondary analysis of a randomized controlled clinical trial [^113KdJaJ]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2021). High credibility.

- **Methods**: This was a prespecified secondary analysis of the DECREASE (Dapagliflozin Plus Exenatide on Central Regulation of Appetite in Diabetes Type 2) study. It was a 16-week, single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, primarily designed to assess the separate and combined effects of dapagliflozin and exenatide on activity in central reward and satiety circuits in response to food-related stimuli. The study was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of the University Medical Centre Amsterdam, the Netherlands (METc number 2017.307). The study was registered at (NCT03361098) and conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice. All participants provided informed consent before any study-specific procedure commenced.

- **Study population**: We recruited participants with type 2 diabetes, aged between 18 and 75 years, with a body mass index between 27 and 40 kg/m². Participants were using stable doses of metformin and/or sulphonylurea derivatives for at least 3 months. HbA1c levels for participants treated with metformin monotherapy were 53 to 86 mmol/mol (7%-10%), and for metformin plus a sulphonylurea, they were 58 to 86 mmol/mol (7.5%-10%). Exclusion criteria were an estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) below 60 mL/min/1.73 m², a history of serious cardiovascular, renal or liver disease, malignancies (excluding basal cell carcinoma), and uncontrolled thyroid disease.

### American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and American College of Endocrinology position statement on the association of SGLT-2 inhibitors and diabetic ketoacidosis [^113Tp7ND]. Endocrine Practice (2016). Low credibility.

Abbreviations: AACE = American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists; ACE = American College of Endocrinology; DKA = diabetic ketoacidosis; EMA = European Medicines Agency; FDA = U.S. Food and Drug Administration; SGLT-2 = sodium glucose cotransporter 2; T1D = type 1 diabetes; T2D = type 2 diabetes.

This position statement aims to address the potential association between SGLT-2 inhibitors and the onset of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) in patients with diabetes. SGLT-2 inhibitors, which are used to lower blood glucose levels, have been linked to rare occurrences of DKA, particularly in patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) but also in some patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). The European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have reviewed reports of DKA in patients using SGLT-2 inhibitors, highlighting the importance of monitoring for this potential adverse effect.

- **Clinical guidance**: Clinicians should exercise caution when prescribing SGLT-2 inhibitors, especially in off-label use for T1D patients. Monitoring for signs of DKA, such as abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, is critical. Patients should be educated on the symptoms of DKA and instructed to seek immediate medical attention if they experience any related symptoms.

- **Research implications**: Further studies are needed to understand the mechanisms by which SGLT-2 inhibitors may predispose patients to DKA. Identifying specific risk factors and patient populations at increased risk will be key in mitigating this adverse effect.

In summary, the position statement emphasizes the need for awareness and monitoring of DKA symptoms in patients prescribed SGLT-2 inhibitors, with a call for continued research into the safety profile of these medications.

### Synjardy [^1126M7YC]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The data in Table 2 are derived from a pool of four 24-week placebo-controlled trials and 18-week data from a placebo-controlled trial with basal insulin in adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Empagliflozin was used as monotherapy in one trial and as add-on therapy in four trials [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].

These data reflect exposure of 1,976 adult patients to empagliflozin, with a mean exposure duration of approximately 23 weeks. Patients received placebo (N = 995), empagliflozin 10 mg (N = 999), or empagliflozin 25 mg (N = 977) once daily. The mean age of the population was 56 years, and 3% were older than 75 years of age. More than half (55%) of the population was male; 46% were White, 50% were Asian, and 3% were Black or African American. At baseline, 57% of the population had diabetes mellitus for more than 5 years and had a mean hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) of 8%. Established microvascular complications of diabetes mellitus at baseline included diabetic nephropathy (7%), retinopathy (8%), or neuropathy (16%). Baseline renal function was normal or mildly impaired in 91% of patients and moderately impaired in 9% of patients (mean eGFR 86.8 mL/min/1.73 m²).

Table 2 shows adverse reactions (excluding hypoglycemia) that were not present at baseline, occurred more commonly in empagliflozin-treated patients than placebo-treated patients, and occurred in greater than or equal to 2% of empagliflozin-treated patients.

Thirst (including polydipsia) was reported in 0%, 1.7%, and 1.5% for placebo, empagliflozin 10 mg, and empagliflozin 25 mg, respectively.

### Approach to the patient: "Utility of the copeptin assay" [^111SE5FU]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Low credibility.

Unfortunately, the distinction between central diabetes insipidus and primary polydipsia is not quite so straightforward because of the considerable overlap in baseline copeptin levels. In particular, distinguishing partial central diabetes insipidus from primary polydipsia is very challenging. Two new copeptin-based test procedures with high diagnostic accuracy have been proposed to overcome these difficulties: the hypertonic saline stimulation test and the arginine stimulation test.

Using osmotically stimulated copeptin levels as a diagnostic measure for diabetes insipidus was first described by our group in a study involving 55 patients with polyuria–polydipsia syndrome. Here, the cut-off value for copeptin of 4.9 mmol/L, measured following a rise in plasma sodium levels above 147 mmol/L, showed high diagnostic accuracy in distinguishing central diabetes insipidus from primary polydipsia. We have recently validated this derived copeptin cut-off level in an international multicenter study including 156 patients with polyuria–polydipsia syndrome. For this study, plasma sodium levels were increased up to 150 mmol/L by an infusion of 3% hypertonic saline adjusted for body weight. The diagnostic value of the osmotically stimulated copeptin level was confirmed, with a threshold of 4.9 pmol/L showing a diagnostic accuracy of 97% for the diagnosis of central diabetes insipidus. The diagnostic accuracy was only slightly lower at 95% when comparing partial central diabetes insipidus with primary polydipsia. In addition, the test proved to be safe and well tolerated.

### Clinical review: Treatment of neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus [^116inXMr]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

In recent years, there have been several improvements in the treatment of neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus (DI). These improvements include new formulations of the vasopressin analog, desmopressin, a better understanding of the effect of fluid intake on dosing, and more information about the treatment of infants, children, and pregnant women who present special challenges. This review aims to summarize past information relative to the safety and efficacy of treatments for the types of DI caused by a primary deficiency of vasopressin.

- **Evidence acquisition**: The review is based on publications identified primarily by a PubMed search of the international literature without limitations of date.

- **Evidence synthesis**: In acute settings where fluid intake is determined by factors other than thirst, desmopressin should be given intravenously in doses that have a short duration of action and can be adjusted quickly in accordance with changes in hydration as indicated by plasma sodium. In ambulatory patients, the oral formulations (tablet or melt) are preferred for their convenience. If fluid intake is regulated normally by the thirst mechanism, the tablets or melt can be taken safely 1 to 3 times a day in doses sufficient to completely eliminate the polyuria. However, if fluid intake consistently exceeds replacement needs, as evidenced by the development of hyponatremia, the dose should be reduced to allow higher than normal rates of urine output or intermittent breakthrough diuresis. This regimen is often indicated in infants or children because their rate of fluid intake tends to be greater.

The overall incidence of adverse events for the 8-trial, short-term, placebo-controlled pool in adult patients treated with dapagliflozin 10 mg and metformin HCl was 60.3% compared to 58.2% for the placebo and metformin HCl group. Discontinuation of therapy due to adverse events in patients who received dapagliflozin 10 mg and metformin HCl was 4% compared to 3.3% for the placebo and metformin HCl group. The most commonly reported events leading to discontinuation and reported in at least 3 patients treated with dapagliflozin 10 mg and metformin HCl were renal impairment (0.7%), increased blood creatinine (0.2%), decreased renal creatinine clearance (0.2%), and urinary tract infection (0.2%).

- **Common adverse reactions**: Common adverse reactions in adults associated with the use of dapagliflozin and metformin HCl are shown below. These adverse reactions were not present at baseline, occurred more commonly on dapagliflozin and metformin HCl than on placebo, and occurred in at least 2% of patients treated with either dapagliflozin 5 mg or dapagliflozin 10 mg.

- **Glycemic control trials**: Data are derived from 12 glycemic control placebo-controlled trials in adults ranging from 12 to 24 weeks. In four trials, dapagliflozin was used as monotherapy, and in eight trials, it was used as an add-on to background antidiabetic therapy or as combination therapy with metformin HCl [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].

### Effect of short-term use of dapagliflozin on impaired awareness of hypoglycaemia in people with type 1 diabetes [^111c8rj9]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2021). Low credibility.

Participants first attended a screening visit, which included their medical history and a standard physical examination, encompassing measurements of body weight, height, blood pressure, pulse rate, and screening for peripheral neuropathy. Blood samples were collected for determining HbA1c and serum creatinine levels.

After inclusion, patients were randomly assigned to either dapagliflozin or a matching placebo treatment for 8 weeks, following a cross-over design with a 2-week washout period between treatments. The investigator enrolled participants, who were assigned to treatments based on a randomization list managed by our hospital's pharmacy department, ensuring a double-blinded study. Randomization utilized a computer program with blocks of two subjects, ensuring equal numbers began treatment with dapagliflozin or placebo. Before the medication phase, patients received ketone meters and were advised to recognize potential symptoms of (normoglycaemic) diabetic ketoacidosis, such as nausea and vomiting. They were instructed to contact the study site if symptoms of ketoacidosis were suspected or if blood ketone levels, measured by themselves, were ≥ 1.5 mmol/L, regardless of blood glucose levels. Dapagliflozin and placebo capsules were administered at a dose of 10 mg once daily.

After starting the study medication, patients were instructed to reduce prandial insulin by 10% to mitigate the risk of hypoglycaemia. Participants were requested to perform a four-point daily blood glucose profile.

### Vasopressin-V2 receptor stimulation reduces sodium excretion in healthy humans [^113oX5Mn]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2005). Low credibility.

In addition to its effect on water permeability, vasopressin, through its V2 receptors (AVPR2), stimulates Na reabsorption in the collecting duct by increasing the activity of the amiloride-sensitive sodium channel ENaC. This study evaluated whether dDAVP (a potent AVPR2 agonist) reduces sodium excretion in healthy humans (n = 6) and in patients with central (C; n = 2) or nephrogenic (N) diabetes insipidus (DI) as a result of mutations of either the aquaporin 2 gene (AQP2; n = 3) or AVPR2 (n = 10).

dDAVP was infused intravenously (0.3 microg/kg body wt in 20 min), and urine was collected for 60 min before (basal) and 150 min after the infusion. dDAVP markedly reduced both urine flow rate and sodium excretion in healthy individuals. A reduction in sodium excretion was also observed in CDI and NDI-AQP2 patients but not in NDI-AVPR2 patients. The magnitude of the fall in sodium excretion correlated with the rise in urine osmolality and the fall in urine output but not with the simultaneously observed fall in mean BP.

These results suggest that the dDAVP-induced antinatriuresis is due to a direct V2 receptor-dependent stimulation of sodium reabsorption in the collecting duct and is not secondary to a hemodynamic effect. In conclusion, this study reveals a potent V2-dependent antinatriuretic effect of vasopressin in humans. The possibility that an inappropriate stimulation of ENaC by vasopressin might lead to significant sodium retention in chronic situations remains to be determined.
