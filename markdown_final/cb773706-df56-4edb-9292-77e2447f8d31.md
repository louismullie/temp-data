## Question

Are there any new studies or trials on the effectiveness of anticoagulation therapy in atrial fibrillation?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the most impactful new evidence on anticoagulation in atrial fibrillation from 2024–2025, with clear reasoning and verification steps. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about which studies are truly new and high-impact. Then, I should verify the key findings and quantify effect sizes. Next, I will integrate these results with current guideline positions and highlight controversies. After that, I need to translate the evidence into practical clinical recommendations. Finally, I will acknowledge limitations and outline next steps for practice and research.

> Let me first confirm the most consequential new evidence. The CATALYST individual patient data meta-analysis of randomized trials establishes the optimal timing of DOAC initiation after acute ischemic stroke in AF, favoring early initiation within 4 days over delayed initiation, with a reduction in recurrent ischemic stroke and no excess symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage, which is practice-changing for secondary prevention timing decisions [^117VLExR]. The OCEANIC-AF phase 3 trial comparing asundexian to apixaban was stopped early for inferior efficacy, with a markedly higher rate of stroke or systemic embolism on asundexian despite fewer major bleeds, signaling a negative outcome for factor XIa inhibition as a safer anticoagulant strategy in AF at this stage [^112uaboQ]. The 2025 SCAI/HRS guideline synthesizes randomized data and concludes that left atrial appendage occlusion can reduce all-cause mortality and hemorrhagic stroke without increasing ischemic stroke, positioning LAAO as a reasonable alternative for selected patients who cannot tolerate long-term oral anticoagulation [^113fqQGw]. Finally, a contemporary meta-analysis of randomized trials suggests catheter ablation may reduce stroke risk by about 30–40%, though confirmatory trials are still needed before routine use for stroke prevention is endorsed [^112FjGv9].

> I will now examine the CATALYST results in detail. Early DOAC initiation within 4 days reduced the composite of recurrent ischemic stroke, symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage, or unclassified stroke at 30 days, driven primarily by fewer recurrent ischemic strokes, with no increase in symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage, which resolves a long-standing uncertainty in neuro-cardiology practice and supports earlier anticoagulation after mild-to-moderate strokes in AF [^117VLExR]. Wait, let me verify the magnitude and consistency; the odds ratio for the primary composite was 0.70 with a 95% CI 0.50–0.98, and for recurrent ischemic stroke 0.66 with a 95% CI 0.45–0.96, indicating clinically meaningful absolute risk reduction in a population with median NIHSS around 5, which is representative of many real-world ischemic strokes in AF [^117VLExR].

> Next, I should review the OCEANIC-AF trial signal. Asundexian 50 mg once daily was inferior to apixaban for preventing stroke or systemic embolism, with a hazard ratio of 3.79 and wide confidence intervals, while major bleeding was lower, underscoring that bleeding reduction alone is insufficient if efficacy is compromised; this is a critical negative result that halts further development of this factor XIa inhibitor for AF stroke prevention at this dose and in this population [^112uaboQ]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about the entire pathway; factor XIa inhibition remains mechanistically attractive, but this trial indicates the current regimen and target engagement were inadequate for stroke prevention in high-risk AF, necessitating dose optimization or alternative strategies before reconsideration [^112uaboQ].

> Let me consider the LAAO evidence and guideline stance. The 2025 SCAI/HRS guideline reports that LAAO is associated with lower all-cause mortality and substantially fewer hemorrhagic strokes, with only a nonsignificant trend toward more ischemic stroke, and procedural harms are modest, supporting LAAO as a reasonable alternative when OAC is contraindicated or not tolerated, particularly in patients with high bleeding risk or strong preference to avoid long-term anticoagulation [^113fqQGw]. I should double-check cost-effectiveness signals; the guideline notes LAAO was favored in most modeled comparisons versus warfarin and several DOACs, which may influence shared decision-making in systems where cost and resource use matter, though patient selection and life expectancy remain key [^113fqQGw].

> I need to check the ablation data carefully. A meta-analysis of 18 contemporary randomized trials suggests catheter ablation reduces stroke by about 30–40% versus medical therapy, with low heterogeneity and a number needed to treat near 79, but the authors appropriately call for a dedicated confirmatory trial before recommending ablation solely for stroke prevention, so this should not change routine practice yet [^112FjGv9]. But wait, what if rhythm control itself modifies stroke risk independent of anticoagulation? The signal is biologically plausible, yet confounding by anticoagulation management and surveillance in trials necessitates cautious interpretation until a large, adequately powered stroke endpoint trial is completed [^112FjGv9].

> Now, I should integrate these findings with current guideline positions. The ACC expert consensus on device-detected AF recommends anticoagulation for episodes lasting 24 hours or more when CHA2DS2-VASc is at least 2, and considers anticoagulation for 5–24 minute episodes when CHA2DS2-VASc is at least 3, reflecting a nuanced balance of stroke and bleeding risks in subclinical AF uncovered by monitoring [^115oNLuR]. Shared decision-making tools and implementation strategies have been tested, but real-world uptake remains suboptimal, reinforcing the need for system-level interventions to close the evidence-to-practice gap in AF stroke prevention [^111qGViz] [^117VgPSQ].

> Translating to practice, I should confirm the following: for acute ischemic stroke with AF, initiate DOAC within 4 days when safe, aligning with CATALYST, while individualizing based on infarct size, hemorrhagic transformation risk, and blood pressure stability; for stable AF without contraindications, DOACs remain first-line per pivotal trials and labeling; for patients with prior intracranial hemorrhage, restarting OAC increases recurrent ICH risk without clear ischemic benefit, so LAAO should be strongly considered; and for AF with stable CAD, OAC monotherapy is preferred over OAC plus single antiplatelet therapy to reduce bleeding without increasing ischemic events [^117VLExR] [^112AvaKr] [^115aK5Dt] [^115rsW1W] [^114LXLK4] [^113fqQGw]. Hold on, I should verify the CAD point; pooled randomized data consistently show fewer major bleeds with monotherapy and no loss of ischemic protection, supporting de-escalation after an initial period of combination therapy post-PCI in most patients [^115rsW1W] [^114LXLK4].

> I need to ensure I address special populations and residual risk. In the very elderly, real-world data suggest DOACs maintain favorable net clinical benefit versus VKAs when used appropriately, though TTR with warfarin and dose adjustments matter, and undertreatment remains common, so careful risk–benefit counseling is essential [^113QTgd4] [^116xM1zX]. For device-detected AF, modeling and meta-analytic data indicate a modest net benefit of NOACs at higher stroke risk thresholds, but the absolute stroke rates are low and bleeding increases meaningfully, reinforcing guideline thresholds and the need for individualized decisions rather than blanket anticoagulation for brief episodes [^114cKWRD] [^111aAEam]. Finally, even with modern OAC therapy, residual stroke risk persists at several percent per year after AF-related stroke, underscoring the importance of aggressive risk factor modification and consideration of adjunctive strategies in selected patients [^112kGELE].

> Let me reconsider areas of uncertainty and next steps. The optimal duration of anticoagulation after successful ablation without arrhythmia recurrence remains unsettled, with ongoing trials like OCEAN exploring whether extended OAC beyond 1 year provides incremental benefit, so current practice should align with risk scores and surveillance rather than routine discontinuation or indefinite therapy for all [^111nksBu]. Novel anticoagulants targeting factor XIa are not ready for prime time in AF after OCEANIC-AF, but mechanistic rationale persists, and future regimens may yet find a role if efficacy can be achieved without compromising safety [^112uaboQ]. Finally, implementation science must catch up; despite strong evidence, OAC remains underprescribed in high-risk AF, and pragmatic ED and outpatient interventions show mixed effects, indicating that multifaceted, persistent quality improvement is necessary to realize population-level stroke prevention gains [^112sz1BQ] [^117VgPSQ].

> In summary, the most impactful new evidence supports early DOAC initiation after AF-related ischemic stroke, highlights the failure of asundexian to match apixaban for stroke prevention, and strengthens the role of LAAO as a reasonable alternative when OAC is unsuitable, while ablation shows a promising but unconfirmed stroke signal that warrants a dedicated endpoint trial; integrating these findings with guidelines reinforces DOACs as first-line, risk-stratified use of anticoagulation in device-detected AF, preference for OAC monotherapy in stable CAD, and careful, shared decision-making in patients with prior ICH or very high bleeding risk [^117VLExR] [^112uaboQ] [^113fqQGw] [^112FjGv9] [^115oNLuR] [^115rsW1W] [^115aK5Dt].

Recent trials and studies confirm that **DOACs remain the preferred first-line therapy** for stroke prevention in nonvalvular AF, with superior safety profiles compared to warfarin [^112eCymF] [^112AvaKr]. Early DOAC initiation within 4 days after ischemic stroke [^117VLExR] reduces recurrent ischemic stroke without increasing intracranial hemorrhage, supporting earlier anticoagulation in carefully selected patients [^117VLExR]. In stable CAD, OAC monotherapy is favored over OAC plus antiplatelet therapy due to lower bleeding risk without loss of ischemic protection [^115rsW1W] [^114LXLK4]. For device-detected AF, anticoagulation is reasonable for episodes ≥ 24 hours when CHA2DS2-VASc ≥ 2, with a modest net benefit despite increased bleeding [^115oNLuR] [^114cKWRD]. Asundexian failed noninferiority and increased stroke risk versus apixaban, so it is not a viable alternative [^112uaboQ]. LAAO remains an option for patients with high bleeding risk or OAC intolerance, with lower hemorrhagic stroke but no clear ischemic stroke reduction [^113fqQGw].

---

## Comparative effectiveness of DOACs versus warfarin

- **DOACs vs warfarin**: DOACs (apixaban, rivaroxaban, dabigatran, edoxaban) are preferred over warfarin for nonvalvular AF due to lower intracranial hemorrhage and comparable or superior stroke prevention [^112eCymF] [^112AvaKr].

- **Real-world data**: Large observational cohorts show lower all-cause mortality and ischemic stroke with rivaroxaban vs apixaban or edoxaban, but confounding by indication and baseline differences limit inference [^115MAKV4].

- **Warfarin TTR**: Maintaining TTR ≥ 60% is critical; lower TTR increases stroke and bleeding, narrowing the safety gap with DOACs [^113QTgd4].

---

## Timing of anticoagulation initiation after acute ischemic stroke

Early initiation of DOACs within 4 days [^117VLExR] after ischemic stroke reduces recurrent ischemic stroke without increasing symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, supporting earlier anticoagulation in selected patients [^117VLExR]. However, **delayed initiation** (≥ 5 days) is associated with higher recurrent ischemic stroke, reinforcing the benefit of early anticoagulation when safe [^117VLExR].

---

## Anticoagulation strategies in patients with stable coronary artery disease (CAD)

OAC monotherapy is favored over OAC plus single antiplatelet therapy because it **reduces major bleeding** without increasing ischemic events in stable CAD with AF [^115rsW1W] [^114LXLK4]. Dual therapy with OAC plus antiplatelet therapy increases bleeding without improving ischemic outcomes, so it should be avoided in stable CAD [^115rsW1W] [^114LXLK4].

---

## Anticoagulation in patients with device-detected atrial fibrillation

For device-detected AF, **ARTESiA** showed that apixaban reduced stroke/systemic embolism versus aspirin but increased major bleeding, indicating a modest net benefit in higher-risk patients [^111aAEam]. In contrast, **NOAH-AFNET 6** found no stroke reduction and more bleeding with edoxaban, highlighting heterogeneity and the need for careful patient selection [^114cKWRD].

---

## Novel anticoagulants and emerging therapies

Asundexian (factor XIa inhibitor) was **noninferior for stroke prevention** versus apixaban and increased stroke risk, leading to early termination and no current role in AF [^112uaboQ]. LAAO is a reasonable alternative for patients with high bleeding risk or OAC intolerance, with lower hemorrhagic stroke but no clear reduction in ischemic stroke [^113fqQGw].

---

## Special populations and clinical scenarios

- **Elderly patients**: DOACs are preferred in the elderly due to lower intracranial hemorrhage; real-world data suggest favorable outcomes with appropriate dosing [^113QTgd4].

- **Renal impairment**: DOACs require dose adjustment; edoxaban is contraindicated in CrCl > 95 mL/min due to increased ischemic stroke risk [^116Njemy].

- **Post-ablation**: Continued anticoagulation is recommended for at least 2–3 months, with longer-term decisions based on CHA2DS2-VASc and recurrence [^1145zo2c].

---

## Safety and bleeding risk assessments

HAS-BLED and ORBIT have **modest predictive performance** for major bleeding; clinicians should use them alongside clinical judgment [^1121BFAx]. Biomarkers such as GDF-15 may improve bleeding risk prediction, but they are not yet widely adopted in routine practice [^114Fqd9X].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Current guidelines recommend DOACs as **first-line therapy** for nonvalvular AF, with warfarin reserved for valvular AF or specific contraindications to DOACs. For device-detected AF, anticoagulation is reasonable for episodes ≥ 24 hours when CHA2DS2-VASc ≥ 2, balancing stroke and bleeding risks [^115oNLuR].

---

Recent evidence reinforces DOACs as **first-line therapy** for nonvalvular AF, with early post-stroke initiation, OAC monotherapy in stable CAD, and selective anticoagulation in device-detected AF. Asundexian is not a viable alternative, and LAAO remains an option for high bleeding risk patients.

Real‐world studies providing data on the effectiveness and safety of DOACs in older patients with AF remain scarce. These investigations often grapple with limitations such as limited statistical power due to low event rates and small cohort sizes. This scarcity in real‐world evidence emphasizes the need for more comprehensive studies focusing on the specific nuances and challenges faced by this older demographic in actual clinical practice. A real‐world study consisting of 11 760 patients showed that older patients with AF are often not adequately treated with OACs, despite their high risk of stroke. Additionally, it demonstrated that patients on warfarin with time in therapeutic range ≥ 60% had a lower stroke incidence compared with those with time in therapeutic range < 60%, whereas those on high‐dose DOACs had a higher net clinical benefit with lower intracranial hemorrhage rates.

Clinical Perspective

Atrial fibrillation (AF) represents the most prevalent cardiac arrhythmia and manifests in diverse prevalence rates, spanning from 0.1% in individuals younger than 55 years to 17.7% in octogenarians. Notably, the population aged 80 years and older is predicted to triple by 2050, signifying a rapid increase compared with patients with AF > 65 years. AF, often asymptomatic, harbors substantial risks, elevating the likelihood of stroke, heart failure, renal failure, cognitive decline, and all‐cause mortality. Its onset and severity strongly correlate with age and comorbidities, significantly augmenting stroke risk by 5‐fold. With advancing age, its prevalence escalates steadily, reaching 10% to 17% beyond 80 years. Conversely age emerges as a pivotal risk factor for AF, established through extensive studies alongside with arterial hypertension, congestive heart failure, diabetes, coronary artery disease, and valvular heart disease. An age‐associated rise in stroke risk is seen across sexes and spiking beyond 65 and 80 to 89 years, where AF emerges as a predominant contributor to stroke incidence. Moreover, age is considered a crucial factor in determining CHA 2 DS 2 VASc and HASBLED scores, indicative for increased thromboembolic and bleeding risks, respectively. Despite the efficacy and safety advantages for stroke prevention of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) over vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) in nonvalvular AF, their utility in octogenarians remains unclear due to their underrepresentation in pivotal trials. There is an ongoing debate whether DOACs may not offer as many advantages in older patients compared with VKAs, which warrants careful evaluation. Given the potential differences in outcomes between these anticoagulation strategies in older populations, our study aims to test the hypothesis that DOACs do not provide as much benefit as VKA antagonists in patients aged 80 years and older. Thus, the objectives of this study are (1) to offer a comprehensive overview of prevalence, outcomes, and risk factors in patients ≥ 80 years presenting in the setting of an emergency department (ED); and (2) to evaluate the use of VKA versus DOAC treatment regimens, while specifically investigating whether DOACs are less beneficial compared with VKAs in this high‐risk older population.

### Collaboration on the optimal timing of anticoagulation after ischaemic stroke and atrial fibrillation: a systematic review and prospective individual participant data meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (CATALYST) [^117VLExR]. Lancet (2025). Excellent credibility.

Background

The optimal timing of oral anticoagulation for prevention of early ischaemic stroke recurrence in people with acute ischaemic stroke and atrial fibrillation remains uncertain. We aimed to estimate the effects of starting a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) early (≤ 4 days) versus later (≥ 5 days) after onset of ischaemic stroke.

Methods

For this systematic review and meta-analysis we searched the electronic databases PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Embase for randomised controlled trials published from inception until March 16, 2025. We included clinical trials if they were pre-registered, randomised, investigated clinical outcomes, and included participants with acute ischaemic stroke and atrial fibrillation who were assigned to either early or later initiation (≤ 4 days vs ≥ 5 days) of a DOAC in approved doses. The primary outcome was a composite of recurrent ischaemic stroke, symptomatic intracerebral haemorrhage, or unclassified stroke within 30 days of randomisation. Secondary outcomes included components of the primary composite within 30 days and 90 days. We did a one-stage individual patient data meta-analysis with the use of a generalised linear mixed-effects model, accounting for between-trial differences, to generate treatment effects, which are presented as odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42024522634.

Findings

We identified four eligible trials: TIMING (NCT02961348), ELAN (NCT03148457), OPTIMAS (NCT03759938), and START (NCT03021928). After excluding participants who opted out of data sharing or were not randomly assigned to DOAC initiation within 4 days or at day 5 or later, we included 5441 participants (mean age 77.7 years [SD 10.0], 2472 [45.4%] women, median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale 5 [IQR 3–10]) in the individual patient data meta-analysis. We obtained primary outcome data for 5429 participants. The primary outcome occurred in 57 (2.1%) of 2683 participants who started DOAC early versus 83 (3.0%) of 2746 participants who started later (OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.50–0.98, p = 0.039). Early DOAC reduced the risk of recurrent ischaemic stroke (45 [1.7%] of 2683 vs 70 [2.6%] of 2746, OR 0.66, 0.45–0.96, p = 0.029). There was no evidence of an increase in symptomatic intracerebral haemorrhage with early DOAC initiation (10 [0.4%] of 2683 vs 10 [0.4%] of 2746, OR 1.02, 0.43–2.46, p = 0.96).

Interpretation

For people with acute ischaemic stroke and atrial fibrillation, early DOAC initiation (within 4 days) reduced the risk of the composite outcome of recurrent ischaemic stroke, symptomatic intracerebral haemorrhage, or unclassified stroke within 30 days. These findings support early DOAC initiation in clinical practice.

Funding

The CATALYST collaboration was facilitated by a British Heart Foundation grant for OPTIMAS (grant reference number CS/17/6/33361), with support from researchers at the National Institute for Health and Care Research University College London Hospitals Biomedical Research Centre, and a Swiss National Science Foundation grant for ELAN (32003B_197009; 32003B_169975).

### Recent-onset atrial fibrillation: challenges and opportunities [^116fUqam]. European Heart Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is increasingly diagnosed early, close to its first occurrence due to: (i) increased public awareness with self-screening; (ii) health care initiatives including population screening and opportunistic case finding; and (iii) increased use and surveillance of implantable cardiac devices. At its onset, AF is often low burden, and cardiovascular co-morbidities may be absent or at an early stage. Thus, the management of recent-onset AF has become an issue of growing importance. Professional guidelines have traditionally focused on anticoagulant thromboprophylaxis, generally recommending a cautious approach to rhythm control, and priority has been given to rate control to alleviate symptoms. In recent guidelines, the importance of managing lifestyle and co-morbidities has increased. The AF-SCREEN collaboration proposes that a vigorous approach to active management of recent-onset AF may be warranted. This includes addressing co-morbidities and promoting healthy lifestyles to prevent the emergence or progression of AF and associated cardiovascular disease, as well as the initiation of active rhythm control ± anticoagulation to prevent AF-related morbidity and mortality, including stroke and heart failure (HF). Intuitively, intervention early after AF onset would be beneficial since lifestyle and co-morbidity management, plus rhythm control and anticoagulation, are important contributors to improved outcomes in patients with established AF, but robust evidence is lacking for recent-onset AF. There is a delicate balance between achieving favourable outcomes such as preventing strokes, HF and AF progression vs the complications and potential adverse effects of interventions. Given the serious long-term consequences, innovative approaches are necessary to determine the value and risks of initiating active therapy very early in the course of AF. More data are needed to guide the best management of recent-onset AF, bearing AF burden in mind. Long-term studies using large national databases linked to electronic medical records and rhythm monitoring devices offer excellent opportunities. Shorter-term studies focusing on reducing AF burden to slow AF progression and studies focusing on outcomes such as HF could be used in both randomized clinical trials and observational cohort studies.

### Early versus delayed anticoagulation treatment for people with non-valvular atrial fibrillation-related acute ischaemic stroke [^113aQKQ3]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Measures of treatment effect

We will pool data in meta‐analyses where appropriate; that is, if the treatments, participants, and underlying clinical questions are similar enough for pooling to make sense.

The outcomes are binary, and we will analyse dichotomous data as odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

For time‐to‐event data, we will present the intervention effect using hazard ratios (HRs).

Unit of analysis issues

The primary unit of analysis will be individual participants. For multi‐armed trials, we will combine the arms involving interventions of the same approach; we will exclude arms that do not align with the scope of our review. In the case of a study involving multiple intervention groups, we will avoid including the same intervention group more than once in the meta‐analyses. To ensure independent pair‐wise comparisons, we will split groups that share individuals into two distinct groups. We will not include quasi‐randomised, cross‐over or cluster‐randomised trials.

Dealing with missing data

We will contact the investigators or study authors to obtain missing data (e.g. when a study is identified as abstract only). Where possible, we will use the RevMan calculator to calculate missing standard deviations using other data from the trial, such as confidence intervals, based on methods outlined in Chapter 6 of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. Where the missing data cannot be obtained, we will explore the impact of including such studies with missing data in the overall assessment of results through sensitivity analysis.

### Effect of oral anticoagulant therapy on adverse outcomes in patients with atrial fibrillation after intracranial hemorrhage [^115aK5Dt]. Heart Rhythm (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The optimal management of oral anticoagulant (OAC) therapy in atrial fibrillation (AF) patients following intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) remains uncertain. Although recent randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have investigated this clinical dilemma, findings have been inconclusive.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of restarting OACs in in AF patients after ICH, we conducted a meta-analysis of RCTs.

Methods

We conducted literature search in PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library (CENTRAL), identifying eligible RCTs from inception to March 2025. The primary outcomes were recurrent ICH and stroke or systemic embolism (SSE). Risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were pooled using a random-effects model.

Results

Three RCTs (APACHE-AF, SoSTART, and PRESTIGE-AF), comprising a total of 623 patients with a median follow-up of 1.2 to 1.9 years, were included. Most patients received direct oral anticoagulants. Compared with non-OAC therapy, OAC resumption was associated with a significantly increased risk of recurrent ICH (RR, 3.32; 95% CI, 1.28–8.61) and major bleeding (RR, 3.33; 95% CI, 1.54–7.22), without a significant reduction in SSE (RR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.38–1.23). No significant differences were observed in ischemic stroke, major vascular events, all-cause mortality, or cardiovascular mortality.

Conclusion

In AF patients with prior ICH, restarting OAC therapy is associated with increased risks of recurrent ICH and major bleeding, without a corresponding reduction in thromboembolic events or all-cause mortality.

### Anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy for atrial fibrillation and stable coronary disease: meta-analysis of randomized trials [^115rsW1W]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The optimal long-term antithrombotic strategy in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and stable coronary artery disease (CAD) remains uncertain. Individual randomized controlled trials (RCTs) had variations in their reported results and were not powered for effectiveness outcomes.

Objectives

This study aimed to pool the results of RCTs comparing the effectiveness and safety of oral anticoagulation (OAC) monotherapy vs OAC plus single antiplatelet therapy (SAPT) in patients with AF and stable CAD.

Methods

We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, and ClinicalTrials.gov until September 09, 2024. The primary effectiveness outcome was a composite of myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, systemic embolism, or death. The primary safety outcome was major bleeding. We obtained unpublished results from principal investigators of the included RCTs, as needed, to calculate pooled HRs and 95% CIs and to perform prespecified subgroup analyses.

Results

Among 690 screened records, 4 RCTs with 4,092 randomized patients were included (2 using edoxaban, 1 using rivaroxaban, and 1 using any oral anticoagulant; mean age 73.9 years, 20.1% women). The median follow-up durations ranged from 12 to 30 months (overall estimated weighted mean follow-up of 21.9 months). There were no statistically significant differences between OAC monotherapy vs OAC plus SAPT in the primary effectiveness outcome (7.3% vs 8.2%; HR: 0.90; 95% CI: 0.72–1.12), myocardial infarction (1.0% vs 0.7%; HR: 1.51; 95% CI: 0.75–3.04), ischemic stroke (1.9% vs 2.1%; HR: 0.89; 95% CI: 0.57–1.37), all-cause death (4.2% vs 5.3%; HR: 0.94; 95% CI: 0.49–1.80), or cardiovascular death (2.4% vs 3.0%; HR: 0.79; 95% CI: 0.54–1.15). OAC monotherapy was associated with a lower risk of major bleeding than OAC plus SAPT (3.3% vs 5.7%; HR: 0.59; 95% CI: 0.44–0.79). Subgroup analyses did not show significant interactions for effectiveness but suggested that the magnitude of bleeding reduction may be greater among men (P interaction = 0.03) and among patients with diabetes mellitus (P interaction = 0.04).

Conclusions

In patients with AF and stable CAD, OAC monotherapy, compared with OAC plus SAPT, was not associated with a statistically significant increased risk of ischemic events but resulted in a significantly reduced risk of bleeding.

### Current real-world status of off-label under-and over-dose of direct oral anticoagulants after atrial fibrillation ablation [^115gu2i6]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2025). Medium credibility.

4.6 Study Limitations

This study has several limitations. First, since the analyses were not conducted as part of a randomized controlled trial, caution must be exercised in deriving recommendations from the results. Second, the small number of patients enrolled in some subanalysis groups, and the insufficient number of thromboembolic events means that analyses of safety and efficacy outcomes may not have been adequate for each DOAC dose category, and the magnitude of differences may not have been large enough to identify in multivariate analyses adjusting for clinical risk factors. In addition, caution is needed due to differences in approved dosages and criteria for reducing DOAC doses in Japan compared to other regions. Finally, despite the prospective nature of this study, a significant limitation was seen in terms of the short follow‐up. In fact, the latest expert consensus statement states that "in the intermediate‐risk patients (CHA 2 DS 2 ‐VASc one in men and two in females) category, discontinuation of anticoagulation may be considered 12 months following CA in the absence of clinical symptoms or electrocardiographically documented AF recurrence". Separate strategies may, therefore, need to be considered for anticoagulation therapy before and after 1 year following CA.

### Early versus delayed anticoagulation treatment for people with non-valvular atrial fibrillation-related acute ischaemic stroke [^115CksCs]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Types of interventions

We will include studies comparing early versus late initiation of oral anticoagulation for people with non‐valvular atrial fibrillation‐related ischaemic stroke. Different types of anticoagulant agents used could contribute to heterogeneity. For example, warfarin typically takes two to four days to reach therapeutic INR levels, whereas therapeutic anticoagulation can be achieved as early as the first day of initiating NOAC therapy. So we will report studies using VKAs and NOACs separately.

We will include all oral anticoagulants recommended for stroke prevention in people with non‐valvular atrial fibrillation‐related strokes, which can be categorised into:

VKAs (warfarin)
NOACs (apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, betrixaban, rivaroxaban)

The definitions of early and late initiation of anticoagulants vary, and there are no evidence‐based recommendations regarding the optimal timing of anticoagulation initiation after acute ischaemic stroke in people with non‐valvular atrial fibrillation. We will utilise the following definitions in our primary analysis.

Early anticoagulation: initiation of anticoagulation within four days after stroke onset
Late anticoagulation: initiation of anticoagulation exceeding four days after stroke onset.

We selected this cut‐off time as it is most commonly used in the literature that we are aware of. We will analyse studies using a cut‐off time other than four days separately and provide a narrative summary of findings.

Participants in both groups should receive anticoagulant and stroke care according to local standards. There will be no restriction on dose, frequency, duration of intervention, or geographical location of the intervention in the main analyses.

Our comparators will be as follows.

Early initiation of VKAs (within four days after stroke onset) versus late initiation of VKAs (exceeding four days after stroke onset).

### Warfarin (warfarin sodium) [^113BLMww]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1 Individualized Dosing

The dosage and administration of warfarin sodium tablets must be individualized for each patient according to the patient's International Normalized Ratio (INR) response to the drug. Adjust the dose based on the patient's INR and the condition being treated. Consult the latest evidence-based clinical practice guidelines regarding the duration and intensity of anticoagulation for the indicated conditions.

2.2 Recommended Target INR Ranges and Durations for Individual Indications

An INR of greater than 4.0 appears to provide no additional therapeutic benefit in most patients and is associated with a higher risk of bleeding.

Venous Thromboembolism (including deep venous thrombosis [DVT] and PE)

Adjust the warfarin dose to maintain a target INR of 2.5 (INR range, 2.0 to 3.0) for all treatment durations. The duration of treatment is based on the indication as follows:

For patients with a DVT or PE secondary to a transient (reversible) risk factor, treatment with warfarin for 3 months is recommended.
For patients with an unprovoked DVT or PE, treatment with warfarin is recommended for at least 3 months. After 3 months of therapy, evaluate the risk-benefit ratio of long-term treatment for the individual patient.
For patients with two episodes of unprovoked DVT or PE, long-term treatment with warfarin is recommended. For a patient receiving long-term anticoagulant treatment, periodically reassess the risk-benefit ratio of continuing such treatment in the individual patient.

Atrial Fibrillation

In patients with non-valvular AF, anticoagulate with warfarin to target INR of 2.5 (range, 2.0 to 3.0).

### Ablation of atrial fibrillation and risk of stroke: a meta-analysis [^112FjGv9]. Heart Rhythm (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Despite treatment with anticoagulants, patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) remain exposed to a relevant residual risk of stroke. It remains to be proven whether catheter ablation of AF can lead to an additional stroke protection benefit in these patients.

Objective

This study aimed to investigate a possible stroke protective benefit by catheter ablation in AF.

Methods

This is a systematic review of contemporary randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing catheter ablation with medical treatment. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials in February 2025, pooled data through relative risks (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals, and calculated the number needed to treat. Quality of evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation framework. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were performed for presence/absence of heart failure, CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc of ≥ 2 or < 2, paroxysmal/persistent AF, early ablation, studies allowing discontinuation of oral anticoagulation after ablation, higher/lower quality, published ≤ 5 vs > 5 years ago, and ≥ 12- vs < 12-month follow-up.

Results

We identified 18 eligible RCTs, including 5877 patients. Catheter ablation was associated with a significant reduction in stroke (RR 0.63, 95% confidence interval 0.45–0.87, P = 0.006; quality of evidence, moderate), low heterogeneity observed (I² = 0), and a number needed to treat of 78.7 patients to prevent 1 stroke. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses yielded similar estimates with 30%-40% RR reduction for all subanalyses, except for trials with less than 1 year of follow-up.

Conclusion

Pooling of high-quality RCT data suggests that catheter ablation may lead to significant stroke reduction. A confirmatory trial will be required to provide a conclusive answer to this matter.

### 2024 ACC expert consensus decision pathway on practical approaches for arrhythmia monitoring after stroke: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^111aAEam]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Device-detected atrial fibrillation (AF) and anticoagulation — evidence synthesis indicates the NOAH-AFNET 6 study demonstrated no benefit of edoxaban vs placebo on a composite of stroke, systemic embolism, and cardiac death, whereas ARTESIA, a study of device-detected AF between 6 minutes and 24 hours, reported lower stroke or systemic embolism rates with apixaban (0.78% vs 1.24% per patient-year; P = 0.007). A meta-analysis of both trials indicated stroke and systemic embolism were consistently reduced by anticoagulation (relative risk [RR]: 0.68; CI: 0.50–0.92), although slightly higher bleeding rates were seen in the anticoagulation arms.

### Antiplatelet versus anticoagulation treatment for people with heart failure in sinus rhythm [^114nbVYv]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

People with chronic heart failure have an increased risk of thrombotic complications, including stroke and thromboembolism, which in turn contribute to high mortality. Oral anticoagulants (e.g. warfarin) and antiplatelet agents (e.g. aspirin) are the principal oral antithrombotic agents. Many people with heart failure in sinus rhythm take aspirin because coronary artery disease is the leading cause of heart failure. Oral anticoagulation (OAC) has become a standard in the management of heart failure with atrial fibrillation. However, uncertainty regarding the appropriateness of OAC in heart failure with sinus rhythm remains. This is an update of a review previously published in 2016.

Objectives

To assess the effects of OAC versus antiplatelet agents for all-cause mortality, non-fatal cardiovascular events and risk of major bleeding in adults with heart failure (either with reduced or preserved ejection fraction) who are in sinus rhythm.

Search Methods

In April 2025, we updated the searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) portal. We searched the reference lists of papers and abstracts from cardiology meetings and contacted study authors for further information. We did not apply any language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing antiplatelet therapy versus OAC in adults with chronic heart failure in sinus rhythm. Treatment had to last for at least one month. We compared oral antiplatelets (aspirin, ticlopidine, clopidogrel, prasugrel, ticagrelor, dipyridamole) versus OAC (coumarins, warfarin, non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants).

Data Collection and Analysis

Three review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and assessed the benefits and harms of antiplatelet therapy versus OAC by calculating risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We used GRADE criteria to assess the certainty of evidence.

Main Results

This update did not identify additional studies for inclusion, so the evidence base remains unchanged since the previous review version (published in 2016). We included four RCTs with 4187 eligible participants. All studies compared warfarin with aspirin. One RCT additionally compared warfarin with clopidogrel. All included RCTs studied people with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. Analysis of all outcomes for warfarin versus aspirin was based on 3663 participants from four RCTs. Warfarin and aspirin probably both reduce all-cause mortality, with little to no difference between their risks: 21.9% for warfarin, 21.9% for aspirin (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.13; 4 studies, 3663 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). OAC probably reduces the risk of non-fatal cardiovascular events (6.6% for warfarin, 8.3% for aspirin), which included non-fatal stroke, myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism, peripheral arterial embolism (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.00; 4 studies, 3663 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Warfarin probably increases the risk of major bleeding events: 5.6% for warfarin, 2.8% for aspirin (RR 2.00, 95% CI 1.44 to 2.78; 4 studies, 3663 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). We considered the risk of bias of the included studies to be low. Analysis of warfarin versus clopidogrel was based on one RCT (N = 1064). With little to no difference between their risks, warfarin and clopidogrel may both reduce all-cause mortality: 17.0% for warfarin, 18.3% for clopidogrel (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.21; 1 study, 1064 participants; low-certainty evidence) and non-fatal cardiovascular events slightly, 4.6% for warfarin, 5.4% for clopidogrel (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.45; 1 study, 1064 participants; low-certainty evidence). Warfarin may increase the risk of major bleeding events slightly: 4.9% for warfarin, 2.0% for clopidogrel (RR 2.47, 95% CI 1.24 to 4.91; 1 study, 1064 participants; low-certainty evidence). We considered the risk of bias for this to be low.

Authors' Conclusions

There is some evidence from RCTs that OAC with warfarin compared to platelet inhibition with aspirin probably has little to no effect on mortality in people with systolic heart failure in sinus rhythm (moderate-certainty evidence). Treatment with warfarin probably reduces non-fatal cardiovascular events but probably increases the risk of major bleeding complications (moderate-certainty evidence). We saw a similar pattern of results for the warfarin versus clopidogrel comparison (low-certainty evidence). At present, there are no data on the role of OAC versus antiplatelet agents in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction in sinus rhythm. Also, there were no data from RCTs on the utility of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants compared to antiplatelet agents in heart failure with sinus rhythm.

### Early versus delayed anticoagulation treatment for people with non-valvular atrial fibrillation-related acute ischaemic stroke [^115pMPYL]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Risk of bias assessment in included studies

Two review authors (XZ and TN) will independently assess the risk of bias for each study using the criteria outlined in Chapter 8 of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. They will use the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool 2 (RoB 2; 22 August 2019 version) to assess the critical outcomes during the scheduled follow‐up period in each article (recurrent ischaemic stroke, symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage, major extracranial bleeding, and systemic embolism). They will implement RoB 2 assessments using the RoB 2 Excel tool, available on the RoB 2 website (www.riskofbias.info), and use the following domains to critically appraise each outcome.

Bias arising from the randomisation process
Bias due to deviations from intended interventions
Bias due to missing outcome data
Bias in measurement of the outcome
Bias in selection of the reported result

The review authors will grade each domain as 'high risk of bias', 'some concern', or 'low risk of bias', then assess the overall risk of bias for each prespecified outcome as follows.

Low risk of bias: the trial is at low risk of bias across all domains for the result.
Some concerns: the trial presents concerns in at least one domain for the result but does not exhibit a high risk of bias in any domain.
High risk of bias: the trial is considered to have a high risk of bias in at least one domain for the result, or it raises concerns in multiple domains.

We will resolve any disagreements by discussion or by involving another author (TR). Any of the review authors who are also authors of studies included within the review will not be involved in the risk of bias assessment.

We will assess the effect of assignment to intervention by an intention‐to‐treat (ITT) analysis that includes all randomised participants. We will contact included trial authors for any missing information that may be required to make these judgements. Risk of bias judgements will be included in the summary of findings tables and summarised for each domain and outcome. When examining treatment effects, we will consider the risk of bias in the studies that contribute to that outcome.

### Antithrombotic monotherapy or combination therapy for atrial fibrillation in stable coronary artery disease: a meta-analysis of randomized trials [^114LXLK4]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

In patients with atrial fibrillation and stable coronary artery disease, guidelines recommend oral anticoagulation monotherapy after periods on dual antithrombotic therapy. These recommendations are based on evidence from prematurely terminated randomized controlled trials that were underpowered for bleeding and mortality end points. New data are available, so we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to pool the totality of randomized evidence.

Methods

This investigation was preregistered on International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (CRD42024590457). Systematic searches and data extraction were performed independently and in duplicate for randomized controlled trials enrolling patients with atrial fibrillation and stable coronary artery disease that reported clinical end points. The prespecified coprimary end points were major bleeding and all-cause death. Prespecified secondary outcomes included all bleeding, cardiovascular death, noncardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, the composite of net adverse cardiovascular events and coronary revascularization. End point data were pooled using fixed and random effect models, to generate hazard ratios (HR) and relative risks and corresponding 95% CIs.

Results

Four randomized controlled trials enrolling 4092 patients were eligible, with 2049 randomized to monotherapy and 2043 randomized to dual therapy. Monotherapy reduced the hazard of major bleeding by 41% (HR, 0.59 [95% CI, 0.44–0.79], P < 0.001, I² = 29%). There was no statistically significant difference in hazard of all-cause death (HR, 0.89 [95% CI, 0.45–1.74], P = 0.73, I² = 72%), or other secondary outcomes.

Conclusions

In patients with stable coronary artery disease and atrial fibrillation, oral anticoagulation monotherapy reduces major bleeding compared with dual antithrombotic therapy. There were no significant differences in all-cause and cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, adverse cardiovascular events, and coronary revascularization.

### Oral anticoagulation versus no anticoagulation for stroke prevention in patients with intracranial haemorrhage and atrial fibrillation: an updated meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^116FUa8e]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Oral anticoagulation (OAC) effectively reduces stroke risk in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), but its use after intracranial haemorrhage (ICH) remains controversial due to bleeding concerns. This study aimed to update the evidence on the efficacy and safety of OAC in patients with AF with a history of ICH.

Methods

A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines. We searched PubMed, Scopus and EMBASE for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing OAC versus avoiding anticoagulation in patients with AF post-ICH. The primary outcomes were ischaemic stroke and recurrent ICH. Secondary outcomes included all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), major haemorrhage and a composite endpoint of 'net clinical benefit' (first incident ischaemic stroke and first incident recurrent ICH). Pooled risk ratios (RRs) with 95% CIs were calculated using a random-effects model.

Results

Four RCTs with 653 participants were included. Anticoagulation was associated with a reduced risk of ischaemic stroke (RR 0.23, 95%CI 0.06 to 0.91) and increased risk of recurrent ICH (RR 3.60, 95%CI 1.40 to 9.30). No significant differences were observed in all-cause mortality (RR 0.93, 95%CI 0.59 to 1.46), cardiovascular death (RR 1.01, 95%CI 0.32 to 3.18) and for net clinical benefit (RR 0.72, 95%CI 0.42 to 1.24). Anticoagulation was associated with a significant increased risk of any major haemorrhage (RR 2.49, 95%CI 1.29 to 4.81) and reduced MACE (RR 0.64, 95%CI 0.44 to 0.94).

Conclusions

OAC in patients with AF and prior ICH was associated with a reduced risk of ischaemic stroke and an increased risk of recurrent ICH.

### Two-year follow-up of patients with atrial fibrillation receiving edoxaban in routine clinical practice: results from the global ETNA-AF program [^112eCymF]. Clinical Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

The annual risk of any stroke for patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) is between 1% and 20%. Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), such as edoxaban, are preferred over vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) in patients with AF for the prevention of ischemic stroke. In a meta‐analysis of four pivotal studies, DOACs were associated with a combined 19% risk reduction for any stroke and systemic embolic events (SEEs), a 51% reduction in hemorrhagic stroke, and a 10% risk reduction of all‐cause mortality compared with VKAs. Major society guidelines recommend DOACs as the preferred drug class for stroke prevention in eligible patients with AF. In the ENGAGE AF‐TIMI 48 trial, treatment with edoxaban versus warfarin prevented any stroke or SEEs with similar efficacy, lower rates of bleeding, and significantly lower rates of death from cardiovascular (CV) causes.

Randomized controlled trials have strict inclusion criteria, which limit the selection of patients. In addition, randomized controlled trials have historically included limited representation from various geographical regions, including Asian countries. These limitations have contributed to trial populations that may not fully capture the diversity observed in real‐world settings. Noninterventional studies overcome this limitation by including patients without specific criteria or restrictions, leading to a more diverse study population. Data from real‐world and randomized controlled trials are consistent and show that dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban, effectively prevent thromboembolic events and exhibit similar or decreased risk of major bleeding compared with VKAs. Given these findings, additional data from real‐world analyses are needed demonstrating the effectiveness and safety of edoxaban in a diverse patient population over a long‐term follow‐up.

### Residual risk of recurrent stroke despite anticoagulation in patients with atrial fibrillation: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112kGELE]. JAMA Neurology (2025). High credibility.

Importance

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a leading cause of stroke, and oral anticoagulants (OAC) reduce this risk. However, there are limited data on the residual risk of recurrent stroke in patients with AF.

Objective

To determine the recurrent stroke risk in patients with AF by performing a systematic review and meta-analysis.

Data Sources

Eligible studies were identified by searching Ovid MEDLINE and Embase from inception (Ovid: January 1946; Embase: January 1970) until January 2025.

Study Selection

Eligible studies enrolled patients with prior ischemic stroke and AF, reported information on incidence of recurrent stroke, and had follow-up data for 1 or more years. Three reviewers independently screened abstracts and performed full-text reviews.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Data extraction was performed by 2 reviewers and independently verified by a third. Incidence rates were pooled using random-effects meta-analysis. Analysis was repeated in patients whose qualifying event occurred despite OAC. Study quality was assessed using the Quality In Prognosis Studies tool.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was recurrent ischemic stroke. The secondary outcomes were any recurrent stroke (ischemic stroke or intra-cerebral hemorrhage [ICH]) and ICH during follow-up.

Results

A total of 23 studies were identified, which included 78 733 patients and 140 307 years of follow-up. The median proportion of OAC use across studies was 92%. The pooled incidence of recurrent ischemic stroke was 3.75% per year (95% CI, 3.17%-4.33%). The risk was higher in noninterventional observational cohorts (4.20% per year; 95% CI, 3.41%-4.99%) compared with randomized clinical trials (2.26% per year; 95% CI, 1.96%-2.57%) (P value for interaction < .001). The risk of any recurrent stroke was 4.88% per year (95% CI, 3.87%-5.90%), and the risk of ICH was 0.58% per year (95% CI, 0.43%-0.73%). In patients with stroke despite OAC, the risk was 7.20% per year (95% CI, 5.05%-9.34%) for ischemic stroke, 8.96% per year (95% CI, 8.25%-9.67%) for any stroke, and 1.40% per year (95% CI, 0.40%-2.40%) for ICH.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, even with modern prevention therapy, the residual recurrence risk after AF-related stroke is high, with an estimated 1 in 6 patients experiencing a recurrent ischemic stroke at 5 years. These data demonstrate an urgent need to improve our understanding of the biological processes responsible for recurrence, improve risk stratification, and develop new secondary prevention strategies after AF-related stroke.

### Patient management following percutaneous coronary intervention [^112Ai1nh]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

For patients taking anticoagulant therapy (eg, patients with atrial fibrillation, with mechanical prosthetic valves, and with prior venous thromboembolism), triple antithrombotic therapy (DAPT plus an oral anticoagulant) was formerly the mainstay medical therapy post-PCI. Evidence now supports the use of dual antithrombotic therapy (SAPT plus an oral anticoagulant) in these patients to mitigate bleeding risk. A network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials of patients with atrial fibrillation found that direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) and P2Y12 inhibitor therapy post-PCI was associated with reduced bleeding risk compared to vitamin K antagonist plus DAPT, without a significant difference in major adverse cardiovascular events. The 2021 ACC/AHA/SCAI Guideline for Coronary Artery Revascularization recommends discontinuation of aspirin treatment 1 to 4 weeks post-PCI with maintenance of P2Y12 inhibitor plus DOAC or warfarin therapy to reduce bleeding risk in patients with atrial fibrillation taking oral anticoagulant therapy. Duration of triple antithrombotic therapy should be limited to 1 week post-PCI for most patients, with duration up to 4 weeks considered for patients at high thrombotic and low bleeding risk. The 2024 ESC Guidelines for the management of chronic coronary syndromes recommend early (≤ 1 week) cessation of aspirin therapy after uncomplicated PCI, with continuation of oral anticoagulant and clopidogrel therapy thereafter. The HAS-BLED score can be used to guide decision-making regarding anticoagulation therapy and bleeding risk in patients with atrial fibrillation. The 2021 ACC/AHA/SCAI guideline additionally recommends that choice of a DOAC over warfarin is reasonable to reduce bleeding risk in patients with atrial fibrillation taking oral anticoagulant therapy and DAPT or P2Y12 inhibitor monotherapy. Dual antithrombotic therapy should be continued for up to 12 months post-PCI with transition to oral anticoagulant monotherapy thereafter; early discontinuation at 6 months can be considered for patients with low thrombotic or high bleeding risk. Based on a secondary analysis of the AFIRE (Atrial Fibrillation and Ischemic Events with Rivaroxaban in Patients with Stable Coronary Artery Disease) trial, monotherapy with rivaroxaban could be considered for patients with atrial fibrillation and stable CAD beyond 12 months post-PCI. For patients post-PCI with prior venous thromboembolism on indefinite anticoagulation, a DOAC should be combined with SAPT (Figure 1). Patients with mechanical valves must receive warfarin in combination with SAPT post-PCI, as DOACs are contraindicated in these patients.

8.3 Post‐Procedural Anticoagulation

8.3.1 Immediate Post‐Ablation Period

Patients under minimally interrupted NOACs should receive their next drug dose after procedure termination while uninterrupted dosing should continue as per prescription. Conversely, patients under uninterrupted VKAs should continue therapy under INR‐guided drug dose administration.

8.3.2 Mid‐Long Term Post‐Ablation Period

Patients with low CHADS2, CHA2DS2‐VASc or CHA2D2VA score and with no mandatory indication for long‐term oral anticoagulation should discontinue anticoagulation therapy 2–3 months after ablation irrespective of clinical outcome as the risk of major bleeding due to therapy continuation in these patients outweighs the risk reduction of thromboembolism.

In patients with a CHADS2, CHA2DS2‐VASc or CHA2D2VA score of 2–3 and no documented atrial arrhythmia recurrences during 6‐month follow‐up, permanent discontinuation of oral anticoagulants post‐ablation may be safe.

### Stroke prevention in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation: thoracoscopic left atrial appendage closure with or without surgical ablation [^117CHuSo]. JTCVS Techniques (2025). Medium credibility.

The use of oral anticoagulants (OACs) is recommended for preventing cardioembolic stroke in patients with AF, and LAA closure (LAAC) is a treatment option in patients contraindicated for anticoagulant therapy. The 2 primary types of LAA closure include endocardial and epicardial approaches. The endocardial approach has been studied extensively in clinical trials, which have established its efficacy. However, owing to the requirement for long-term antiplatelet therapy associated with the endocardial approach, the 2020 European Society for Cardiology guideline endorses the epicardial approach for patients unable to receive antiplatelet agents. Nevertheless, large-scale studies on the epicardial approach and corresponding reports remain limited.,

The totally thoracoscopic LAAC and ablation procedure (with the maze procedure, TT-MAZE; without the maze procedure, TT-LAAC) for patients with AF, is guided by 2 objectives — closing the LAA and performing ablation — both from the epicardial side. Recent findings from the LAAOS III study suggest that performing LAAC concurrently with heart surgery may reduce the risks of cardioembolic stroke and systemic embolism. The incidence of subsequent cardioembolic thromboembolism is extremely low at 0.25% to 0.5%, regardless of whether anticoagulation therapy involves warfarin or OACs, demonstrating the procedure's utility in preventing cardioembolic stroke. Additionally, thoracoscopic ablation techniques combining pulmonary vein (PV) and left atrial isolation have attracted interest because of their capacity to restore sinus rhythm.LAA management involving concurrent closure and ablation is considered a rational approach, as it may prevent both cardioembolic stroke and AF-related heart failure over time.

Despite this compelling evidence, reports on surgical LAAC for NVAF are limited. The present study aimed to investigate the efficacy of the TT-MAZE/TT-LAAC procedure performed in 200 patients at our hospital in preventing stroke after anticoagulant discontinuation, regardless of whether sinus rhythm was restored, and in restoring sinus rhythm after ablation.

### Estimating the stroke risk threshold for initiating non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulation in atrial fibrillation: Markov decision model analysis [^1157DD2Q]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2025). Medium credibility.

Effect of Anticoagulation

The effect of anticoagulation on ischemic stroke has been robustly demonstrated in seminal trials comparing warfarin with placebo. In these studies, the annual stroke rate in the placebo arm was ≈6%. Moreover, DOACs have been shown to be superior to warfarin in stroke prevention, and a placebo-imputed analysis estimated that DOACs reduce ischemic stroke on average by 68% compared with placebo. However, observational studies in patients with clinical AF, as well as recent randomized trials in patients with subclinical AF, have suggested that the relative stroke risk reduction with anticoagulation is smaller in patients with lower stroke risk, possibly due to a lower burden of cardioembolic stroke. – A meta-analysis of the randomized trials on subclinical AF reported a 32% reduction in stroke with DOAC therapy in patients whose annual untreated stroke rate was ≈1%. Based on the 68% stroke reduction in patients with a 6% annual stroke risk and the 32% reduction in patients with a 1% annual stroke risk, we assumed that the relative effect of DOAC therapy correlates with the baseline stroke risk and follows a linear trend below the annual nonanticoagulated stroke risk of 6%. Above this level, the relative stroke reduction with DOACs was assumed to remain constant at 68% (Table). Direct comparative trials between DOACs have not been conducted, and in this analysis, all DOACs were considered as a single group.

Regarding major bleeding, no interaction has been reported between the relative increase in bleeding risk with DOACs and baseline stroke rate. The seminal trials showed that warfarin therapy increases major bleeding by approximately 2-fold in high-risk patients, and DOACs have thereafter demonstrated a slightly better safety profile compared with warfarin. Similarly, in the NOAH AFNET 6 trial, edoxaban increased major bleeding risk by approximately 2-fold compared with placebo in patients with subclinical AF and an annual untreated stroke risk of 1% although their stroke risk scores would have suggested a higher risk in the presence of clinical AF. Therefore, in this study, DOAC therapy was assumed to have a constant relative effect on bleeding risk across the range of untreated stroke risk, with the risk ratio estimated from the meta-analysis of seminal warfarin trials and DOAC trials (relative risk, 2.22×0.86 = 1.91; Table). DOAC therapy was modeled to increase all bleeding types similarly. After all major bleeding events, DOAC therapy was considered to be paused temporarily for 1 month in the model.

14.1 Reduction of Risk of Stroke and Systemic Embolism in Non-valvular Atrial Fibrillation in Adult Patients

The clinical evidence for the efficacy of dabigatran etexilate capsules was derived from RE-LY (Randomized Evaluation of Long-term Anticoagulant Therapy), a multi-center, multi-national, randomized, parallel group trial comparing two blinded dosages of dabigatran etexilate capsules (110 mg twice daily and 150 mg twice daily) with open-label warfarin (dosed to target INR of 2 to 3) in patients with non-valvular, persistent, paroxysmal, or permanent atrial fibrillation and one or more of the following additional risk factors:

- Previous stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA), or systemic embolism

- Left ventricular ejection fraction < 40%

- Symptomatic heart failure, ≥ New York Heart Association Class 2

- Age ≥ 75 years

- **Age ≥ 65 years and one of the following**: diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease (CAD), or hypertension

The primary objective of this study was to determine if dabigatran etexilate capsules was non-inferior to warfarin in reducing the occurrence of the composite endpoint, stroke (ischemic and hemorrhagic) and systemic embolism. The study was designed to ensure that dabigatran etexilate capsules preserved more than 50% of warfarin's effect as established by previous randomized, placebo-controlled trials of warfarin in atrial fibrillation. Statistical superiority was also analyzed.

### Epistaxis versus nonepistaxis bleeding in anticoagulated patients with atrial fibrillation: results from the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 trial [^114Q42xH]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Epistaxis is a common condition, accounting for 1 in 200 emergency department visits in the United States. Though the cause of epistaxis is dependent on many factors, rates of epistaxis are higher among people taking antithrombotic therapies. Importantly, use of an anticoagulant or antiplatelet agent is seen in roughly 50% to 60% of patients presenting with epistaxis in observational studies.,

Despite the frequency of epistaxis in clinical practice and the potential for disruption in medications, these types of bleeding events have received little attention in cardiovascular trials of antithrombotic therapies. In the ENGAGE AF‐TIMI 48 (Effective Anticoagulation with Factor Xa Next Generation in Atrial Fibrillation–Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 48) trial, edoxaban was shown to significantly reduce the risk of multiple types and severities of nongastrointestinal bleeding events relative to warfarin, but the effect of edoxaban on epistaxis has not been explored. Here we describe the frequency, severity, and clinical outcomes of epistaxis in anticoagulated patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) randomized to edoxaban or warfarin.

14.1 Reduction of Risk of Stroke and Systemic Embolism in Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation

ARISTOTLE

Evidence for the efficacy and safety of apixaban was derived from ARISTOTLE, a multinational, double-blind study in patients with nonvalvular AF comparing the effects of apixaban and warfarin on the risk of stroke and non-central nervous system (CNS) systemic embolism. In ARISTOTLE, patients were randomized to apixaban tablets 5 mg orally twice daily (or 2.5 mg twice daily in subjects with at least 2 of the following characteristics: age greater than or equal to 80 years, body weight less than or equal to 60 kg, or serum creatinine greater than or equal to 1.5 mg/dL) or to warfarin (targeted to an INR range of 2.0–3.0). Patients had to have one or more of the following additional risk factors for stroke:

- prior stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA)

- prior systemic embolism

- age greater than or equal to 75 years

- arterial hypertension requiring treatment

- diabetes mellitus

- heart failure ≥ New York Heart Association Class 2

- left ventricular ejection fraction ≤ 40%

The primary objective of ARISTOTLE was to determine whether apixaban tablets 5 mg twice daily (or 2.5 mg twice daily) was effective (noninferior to warfarin) in reducing the risk of stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic) and systemic embolism. Superiority of apixaban to warfarin was also examined for the primary endpoint (rate of stroke and systemic embolism), major bleeding, and death from any cause.

Nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) — left atrial appendage occlusion (LAAO) versus oral anticoagulation (OAC) outcomes indicate that LAAO may reduce all-cause mortality (HR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.59–0.96), with no statistically significant differences for overall stroke (HR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.62–1.77) or major bleeding (HR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.65–1.20); LAAO reduced hemorrhagic stroke (HR, 0.24; 95% CI, 0.09–0.61) without a significant increase in ischemic stroke (HR, 1.82; 95% CI, 0.93–3.50). Procedure-related harms were considered small, with pericardial effusion reported in 2.7% of LAAO patients, device embolization 0.6%, procedure-related strokes 0.6%, and a total moderate adverse event rate of 6.9%. The overall level of certainty is moderate. For patient selection, those with elevated bleeding risk, prior bleeding complications, or strong preferences to avoid long-term anticoagulation would reasonably choose LAAO over OAC, whereas LAAO may be inappropriate for patients with less than 1 year of quality life expectancy. Cost analyses summarized by the guideline report that LAAO was probably the more cost effective option in 6 of 9 comparisons versus warfarin, 6 of 6 versus dabigatran, 3 of 5 versus apixaban, and 2 of 3 versus rivaroxaban.

### Incidence and predictors of clinical outcomes in real-life patients with atrial fibrillation treated with oral factor Xa inhibitors: the follow-up results of the ANATOLIA-AF study [^115MAKV4]. Clinical Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

At present, there is a lack of data available for the guidance of selection between factor Xa inhibitors. A direct comparison between rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban for safety and efficacy in patients with AF was not conducted within a RCT. For this purpose, Talmor‐Barkan et al. conducted an observational study to emulate a target trial for head‐to‐head comparison of DOACs therapy (rivaroxaban, apixaban, and dabigatran) by propensity score matching analysis. Six‐year follow‐up results of 56,553 patients showed that the all‐cause mortality and ischemic stroke rates were significantly lower in patients treated with rivaroxaban than those treated with apixaban. Furthermore, the overall bleeding rates were comparable between rivaroxaban, apixaban, and dabigatran. The findings of our study indicate that the rate of net clinical outcomes, the incidence of ischaemic stroke, and the all‐cause mortality rate were significantly lower in the rivaroxaban group than in the apixaban and edoxaban groups. The incidence of major bleeding was comparable among the three factor Xa inhibitors. These results are consistent with those of the aforementioned study from Israel. However, there is a critical point that needs to be emphasized at this point. A key limitation of our study is that, in contrast to the approach taken by Talmor‐Barkan et al. we did not undertake a direct, head‐to‐head comparison of factor Xa inhibitors. In our study, there are differences in the baseline characteristics of the patients in these treatment groups. Such differences may potentially have affected the clinical outcomes. For instance, patients receiving apixaban therapy are older and have higher CHA 2 DS 2 ‐VASc scores than those receiving rivaroxaban or edoxaban therapy. To illustrate further, the proportion of patients with a history of ischaemic stroke or systemic embolism and a history of intracranial hemorrhage was higher in the edoxaban group than in the rivaroxaban and apixaban groups. As evidenced by these examples, notable differences in the baseline characteristics of the patients may have been a contributing factor to the favorable outcomes observed with rivoraxaban.

Apparent homogeneity or heterogeneity among groups should not be over-interpreted.

At the end of the ARISTOTLE study, warfarin patients who completed the study were generally maintained on a VKA with no interruption of anticoagulation. Apixaban patients who completed the study were generally switched to a VKA with a 2-day period of coadministration of apixaban and VKA, so that some patients may not have been adequately anticoagulated after stopping apixaban until attaining a stable and therapeutic INR. During the 30 days following the end of the study, there were 21 stroke or systemic embolism events in the 6791 patients (0.3%) in the apixaban arm compared to 5 in the 6569 patients (0.1%) in the warfarin arm [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

AVERROES

In AVERROES, patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation thought not to be candidates for warfarin therapy were randomized to treatment with apixaban tablets 5 mg orally twice daily (or 2.5 mg twice daily in selected patients) or aspirin 81 to 324 mg once daily. The primary objective of the study was to determine if apixaban was superior to aspirin for preventing the composite outcome of stroke or systemic embolism. AVERROES was stopped early on the basis of a prespecified interim analysis showing a significant reduction in stroke and systemic embolism for apixaban compared to aspirin that was associated with a modest increase in major bleeding (Table 10) [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

### Effectiveness of shared decision making strategies for stroke prevention among patients with atrial fibrillation: cluster randomized controlled trial [^111qGViz]. BMJ (2025). Excellent credibility.

Methods

Trial design and participants

This four arm, cluster randomized, multicenter clinical trial evaluated the effects of usual care alone (control), usual care with a patient decision aid, usual care with an encounter decision aid, or usual care with both decision aids on shared decision making and clinical outcomes. This study was implemented at six US academic medical centers: University of Utah (Salt Lake City, Utah), Mayo Clinic (Rochester, Minnesota), Northwestern University (Chicago, Illinois), University of Alabama at Birmingham (Birmingham, Alabama), University of Michigan (Ann Arbor, Michigan), and Vanderbilt University Medical Center (Nashville, Tennessee). The trial design and protocol have been published elsewhere, and the only minor deviation from this established protocol throughout the course of the study was the addition of telehealth visits at the start of the covid-19 pandemic.

Eligible patients were at least 18 years old, had a diagnosis of non-valvular atrial fibrillation, had at least one non-sex related risk factor for thromboembolic events (that is, CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc ≥ 1 for men, ≥ 2 for women), and were eligible to receive anticoagulation as judged by their clinician. On the basis of their anticoagulation status at baseline, patients were assembled into two cohorts — those considering starting anticoagulation (initiation) and those considering continuing anticoagulation (monitor). The initiation cohort included patients who had no previous anticoagulation history, were taking daily aspirin instead of an anticoagulant, had discontinued anticoagulation usage (for any reason) more than six months before trial participation, or started anticoagulation ≤ 60 days from study enrollment. The monitor cohort consisted of patients who had been taking anticoagulation for more than 60 days and who met at least one of the following criteria: had problems with their current anticoagulation therapy, such as labile international normalized ratio control, perceived or actual side effects, or affordability of medication; emerging evidence suggesting re-evaluation of previous relative contraindications to direct acting oral anticoagulants therapy (for example, apixaban use in cases of renal dysfunction, obesity); or changes in medical condition that might affect stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation, such as declining renal function or a coronary stent placement. Clinician participation was open to those who were involved in the management of eligible patients with atrial fibrillation.

The primary endpoint was based on the time to first event (one per subject). Component counts are for subjects with any event, not necessarily the first.

Figure 4: Kaplan-Meier Estimate of Time to First Stroke or Systemic Embolism in ARISTOTLE (Intent-to-Treat Population) All-cause death was assessed using a sequential testing strategy that allowed testing for superiority if effects on earlier endpoints (stroke plus systemic embolus and major bleeding) were demonstrated. Apixaban treatment resulted in a significantly lower rate of all-cause death (p = 0.046) than did treatment with warfarin, primarily because of a reduction in cardiovascular death, particularly stroke deaths. Non vascular death rates were similar in the treatment arms.

In ARISTOTLE, the results for the primary efficacy endpoint were generally consistent across most major subgroups including weight, CHADS2 score (a scale from 0 to 6 used to predict risk of stroke in patients with AF, with higher scores predicting greater risk), prior warfarin use, level of renal impairment, geographic region, and aspirin use at randomization (Figure 5).

### Asundexian versus apixaban in patients with atrial fibrillation [^112uaboQ]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

Background

Stroke prevention with direct-acting oral anticoagulant agents in patients with atrial fibrillation confers a risk of bleeding and limits their use. Asundexian, an activated factor XI (XIa) inhibitor, is an oral anticoagulant that may prevent strokes with less bleeding.

Methods

In a phase 3, international, double-blind trial, we randomly assigned high-risk patients with atrial fibrillation in a 1:1 ratio to receive asundexian at a dose of 50 mg once daily or standard-dose apixaban. The primary efficacy objective was to determine whether asundexian is at least noninferior to apixaban for the prevention of stroke or systemic embolism. The primary safety objective was to determine whether asundexian is superior to apixaban with respect to major bleeding events.

Results

A total of 14,810 randomly assigned patients were included in the intention-to-treat population. The mean (± SD) age of the patients was 73.9 ± 7.7 years, 35.2% were women, 18.6% had chronic kidney disease, 18.2% had a previous stroke or transient ischemic attack, 16.8% had received oral anticoagulants for no more than 6 weeks, and the mean CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score (range, 0 to 9, with higher scores indicating a greater risk of stroke) was 4.3 ± 1.3. The trial was stopped prematurely at the recommendation of the independent data monitoring committee. Stroke or systemic embolism occurred in 98 patients (1.3%) assigned to receive asundexian and in 26 (0.4%) assigned to receive apixaban (hazard ratio, 3.79; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.46 to 5.83). Major bleeding occurred in 17 patients (0.2%) who received asundexian and in 53 (0.7%) who received apixaban (hazard ratio, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.18 to 0.55). The incidence of any adverse event appeared to be similar in the two groups.

Conclusions

Among patients with atrial fibrillation at risk for stroke, treatment with asundexian at a dose of 50 mg once daily was associated with a higher incidence of stroke or systemic embolism than treatment with apixaban in the period before the trial was stopped prematurely. There were fewer major bleeding events with asundexian than with apixaban during this time. (Funded by Bayer; OCEANIC-AF ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT05643573; EudraCT number, 2022–000758–28.).

A total of 14264 patients were randomized and followed on study treatment for a median of 590 days. The mean age was 71 years and the mean CHADS2score was 3.5. The population was 60% male, 83% Caucasian, 13% Asian and 1.3% Black. There was a history of stroke, TIA, or non-CNS systemic embolism in 55% of patients, and 38% of patients had not taken a vitamin K antagonist (VKA) within 6 weeks at time of screening. Concomitant diseases of patients in this study included hypertension 91%, diabetes 40%, congestive heart failure 63%, and prior myocardial infarction 17%. At baseline, 37% of patients were on aspirin (almost exclusively at a dose of 100 mg or less) and few patients were on clopidogrel. Patients were enrolled in Eastern Europe (39%); North America (19%); Asia, Australia, and New Zealand (15%); Western Europe (15%); and Latin America (13%). Patients randomized to warfarin had a mean percentage of time in the INR target range of 2.0 to 3.0 of 55%, lower during the first few months of the study.

In ROCKET AF, XARELTO was demonstrated non-inferior to warfarin for the primary composite endpoint of time to first occurrence of stroke (any type) or non-CNS systemic embolism [HR (95% CI): 0.88 (0.74, 1.03)], but superiority to warfarin was not demonstrated.

### Rivaroxaban [^117Nt9Aw]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Increased Risk of Thrombotic Events after Premature Discontinuation

Premature discontinuation of any oral anticoagulant, including rivaroxaban tablets, in the absence of adequate alternative anticoagulation increases the risk of thrombotic events. An increased rate of stroke was observed during the transition from rivaroxaban tablets to warfarin in clinical trials in atrial fibrillation patients. If rivaroxaban tablets are discontinued for a reason other than pathological bleeding or completion of a course of therapy, consider coverage with another anticoagulant [see Dosage and Administration (2.3, 2.4) and Clinical Studies (14.1)].

5.2 Risk of Bleeding

Rivaroxaban tablets increase the risk of bleeding, including in any organ, and can cause serious or fatal bleeding. In deciding whether to prescribe rivaroxaban tablets to patients at increased risk of bleeding, the risk of thrombotic events should be weighed against the risk of bleeding.

Promptly evaluate any signs or symptoms of blood loss and consider the need for blood replacement. Discontinue rivaroxaban tablets in patients with active pathological hemorrhage. The terminal elimination half-life of rivaroxaban is 5 to 9 hours in healthy subjects aged 20 to 45 years.

Concomitant use of other drugs that impair hemostasis increases the risk of bleeding. These include aspirin, P2Y12 platelet inhibitors, dual antiplatelet therapy, other antithrombotic agents, fibrinolytic therapy, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) [see Drug Interactions (7.4)], selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors.

Concomitant use of drugs that are known combined P-gp and strong CYP3A inhibitors increases rivaroxaban exposure and may increase bleeding risk [see Drug Interactions (7.2)].

Reversal of Anticoagulant Effect An agent to reverse the anti-factor Xa activity of rivaroxaban is available. Because of high plasma protein binding, rivaroxaban is not dialyzable [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Protamine sulfate and vitamin K are not expected to affect the anticoagulant activity of rivaroxaban. Use of procoagulant reversal agents, such as prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC), activated prothrombin complex concentrate or recombinant factor VIIa, may be considered but has not been evaluated in clinical efficacy and safety studies. Monitoring for the anticoagulation effect of rivaroxaban using a clotting test (PT, INR or aPTT) or anti-factor Xa (FXa) activity is not recommended.

### Apixaban (Eliquis) [^1133JY9x]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

A total of 18,201 patients were randomized and followed on study treatment for a median of 89 weeks. Forty-three percent of patients were vitamin K antagonist (VKA) "naive", defined as having received ≤ 30 consecutive days of treatment with warfarin or another VKA before entering the study. The mean age was 69 years and the mean CHADS2score (a scale from 0 to 6 used to estimate risk of stroke, with higher scores predicting greater risk) was 2.1. The population was 65% male, 83% Caucasian, 14% Asian, and 1% Black. There was a history of stroke, TIA, or non-CNS systemic embolism in 19% of patients. Concomitant diseases of patients in this study included hypertension 88%, diabetes 25%, congestive heart failure (or left ventricular ejection fraction ≤ 40%) 35%, and prior myocardial infarction 14%. Patients treated with warfarin in ARISTOTLE had a mean percentage of time in therapeutic range (INR 2.0–3.0) of 62%.

ELIQUIS was superior to warfarin for the primary endpoint of reducing the risk of stroke and systemic embolism (Table 13 and Figure 4). Superiority to warfarin was primarily attributable to a reduction in hemorrhagic stroke and ischemic strokes with hemorrhagic conversion compared to warfarin. Purely ischemic strokes occurred with similar rates on both drugs.

1 Introduction

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia, and the overall lifetime risk is reported to range from 15% to 40% according to varied ethnicity. Stroke and heart failure are the most significant adverse outcomes for patients with AF. Especially since the risk of stroke in AF patients is approximately three to five times higher compared to those without AF. Thanks to the advent and widespread use of oral anticoagulants (OACs), the incidence of ischemic stroke in patients with AF has significantly decreased. Clinical risk score, such as CHA2DS2‐VASc, is utilized to estimate the risk of stroke in patients with AF and to guide decisions regarding anticoagulation therapy. The CHA2DS2‐VASc score, despite its widespread use in assessing stroke risk in AF patients, has several limitations, such as not fully reflecting all risk factors, ambiguity in the intermediate score range, persistent risk in low‐score patients, and variable predictive accuracy across different populations. In addition, although current stroke risk scores are practical, there are limitations regarding their capacity to accurately predict stroke risk in individual patients. These limitations necessitate comprehensive clinical judgment and possibly additional tools for a more tailored preventive strategy. Therefore, assessing the stasis in patients with AF using biomarkers related to thrombogenesis could provide a more accurate method to determine their stroke risk.

### Predicting clinically relevant bleeding in new-onset atrial fibrillation patients initiating oral anticoagulant therapy: external validation of the AF-BLEED score [^113a2UyA]. Thrombosis Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Atrial fibrillation/flutter (AF/AFL) is associated with an increased stroke risk, for which oral anticoagulation (OAC) is often indicated. Bleeding risk assessment is crucial in these patients to mitigate bleeding complications, yet AF guidelines do not recommend the use of any bleeding risk score (e.g. HAS-BLED) due to concerns about predictive accuracy. The AF-adapted VTE-BLEED (AF-BLEED) score was developed to predict major bleeding (MB) post-OAC initiation.

Aims

Evaluate the incidence of clinically relevant bleeding, and externally validate the AF-BLEED score in new-onset AF/AFL patients.

Methods

Patients enrolled in the DUTCH-AF registry, who started OAC at diagnosis were studied. AF-BLEED categorized patients as low-risk (score ≤ 3) or high-risk (score > 3) for bleeding. Outcomes were first (i) MB and (ii) composite MB and clinically relevant non-major bleeding (CRNMB), with death and OAC discontinuation as competing events. Discrimination (cumulative AUC [AUCt]) was evaluated at 180 days and 2 years.

Results

4647 patients (AF-BLEED low-risk: 94.0%) were included. Cumulative MB incidences for low- and high-risk patients were 0.58% (95%CI 0.34–0.82%) and 1.65% (0.04–3.26%) at 180 days (p 0.04), and 1.82% (1.39–2.26%) and 5.07% (2.26–7.87%) at 2 years (p < 0.001), respectively. Cumulative CRNMB/MB incidences for low- and high-risk patients were 1.81% (1.39–2.24%) and 4.13% (1.62–6.65%) at 180 days (p 0.01), and 6.37% (5.58–7.16%) and 9.68% (5.91–13.45%) at 2 years (p 0.04), respectively. Discrimination was poor to moderate for both outcomes at both time windows, ranging between 0.51 and 0.62.

Conclusion

Although AF-BLEED was associated with subsequent risk of clinically relevant bleeding, its discriminative ability was poor, limiting the practical utility in its current form.

### Edoxaban tosylate (Savaysa) [^116FFXjT]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Patients were well balanced with respect to demographic and baseline characteristics. The percentages of patients age ≥ 75 years and ≥ 80 years were approximately 40% and 17%, respectively. The majority of patients were Caucasian (81%) and male (62%). Approximately 40% of patients had not taken a Vitamin K Antagonist (VKA) (i.e., never took a VKA or had not taken a VKA for more than 2 months).

The mean patient body weight was 84 kg (185 lbs) and 10% of patients had a body weight of ≤ 60 kg. Concomitant diseases of patients in this study included hypertension (94%), congestive heart failure (58%), and prior stroke or transient ischemic attack (28%). At baseline, approximately 30% of patients were on aspirin and approximately 2% of patients were taking a thienopyridine.

Patients randomized to the warfarin arm achieved a mean TTR (time in therapeutic range, INR 2.0 to 3.0) of 65% during the course of the study.

The primary endpoint of the study was the occurrence of first stroke (either ischemic or hemorrhagic) or of a systemic embolic event (SEE) that occurred during treatment or within 3 days from the last dose taken. In the overall results of the study, shown in Table 14.1, both treatment arms of SAVAYSA were non-inferior to warfarin for the primary efficacy endpoint of stroke or SEE. However, the 30 mg (15 mg dose-reduced) treatment arm was numerically less effective than warfarin for the primary endpoint, and was also markedly inferior in reducing the rate of ischemic stroke. Based on the planned superiority analysis (ITT, which required p < 0.01 for success), statistical superiority of the 60 mg (30 mg dose-reduced) treatment arm compared to warfarin was not established in the total study population, but there was a favorable trend [HR (99% CI): 0.87 (0.71, 1.07)].

¶GI bleed includes upper GI, lower GI, and rectal bleeding.

Fatal bleeding is an adjudicated death with the primary cause of death as intracranial bleeding or non-intracranial bleeding during the on-treatment period.

In ARISTOTLE, the results for major bleeding were generally consistent across most major subgroups including age, weight, CHADS2score (a scale from 0 to 6 used to estimate risk of stroke, with higher scores predicting greater risk), prior warfarin use, geographic region, and aspirin use at randomization (Figure 1). Subjects treated with apixaban with diabetes bled more (3% per year) than did subjects without diabetes (1.9% per year).

### Cilostazol [^112DxQX4]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

In eight randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trials, aspirin was coadministered with cilostazol to 201 patients. The most frequent doses and mean durations of aspirin therapy were 75 to 81 mg daily for 137 days (107 patients) and 325 mg daily for 54 days (85 patients). There was no apparent increase in frequency of hemorrhagic adverse effects in patients taking cilostazol and aspirin compared to patients taking placebo and equivalent doses of aspirin.

Warfarin

Cilostazol did not inhibit the pharmacologic effects (PT, aPTT, bleeding time, or platelet aggregation) of R- and S- warfarin after a single 25-mg dose of warfarin. The effect of concomitant multiple dosing of warfarin and cilostazol on the pharmacodynamics of both drugs is unknown.

### Growth differentiation factor-15: a promising biomarker and target in cancer patients [^114Fqd9X]. JACC: CardioOncology (2025). Medium credibility.

The investigators should be congratulated for conducting this elegant study. Multiple cardiology scores are regularly used in the clinic to assess hemostatic status and risk. The CHA 2 DS 2 -VA score is one of the most commonly used assessment of thromboembolic risk and was recently updated to remove the female sex category from the score. The risk of bleeding is assessed by tools like the widely established HAS-BLED score or the more contemporary CAT-BLEED score, specifically designed to evaluate bleeding risk in anticoagulation treatment of atrial fibrillation and cancer-associated thrombosis. Deciding whether to initiate oral anticoagulation is always a careful clinical consideration made together by physicians and patients, guided by current clinical guidelines and tailored to the individual's risk profile and overall health status. Although thromboembolic risk can be reduced with effective oral or intravenous anticoagulation, there typically is an associated increased risk of bleeding events with anticoagulation.

Bleeding complications in cancer patients represent a significant clinical challenge, often complicating treatment strategies and impacting patient outcomes. Current predictive models to assess bleeding risk perform poorly in oncology populations. Therefore, GDF-15 might be very useful for clinicians to get an additional objective measure for bleeding risk assessment. It is therefore especially interesting that the investigators compared the prognostic power of GDF-15 with the HAS-BLED and CAT-BLEED scores and found that a model using GDF-15 alone outperformed both scores in predicting major bleeding, represented by a higher c-statistic. The incorporation of GDF-15 also significantly improved the discriminatory power of the aforementioned scores.

GDF-15's integration into clinical practice holds promise for revolutionizing bleeding risk stratification in oncology. Cancer patients often face the dual challenge of high thromboembolic and bleeding risks, particularly when anticoagulation therapy is considered. By incorporating GDF-15, clinicians may achieve more precise risk assessments, enabling personalized therapeutic strategies. For example, in those at increased risk of bleeding, an alternative strategy that may be considered is left atrial appendage closure. Furthermore, GDF-15's objective measurement could serve as a valuable adjunct to clinician–patient discussions regarding the benefits and risks of anticoagulation therapy.

There was a higher rate of any gastrointestinal bleeds in patients receiving dabigatran etexilate capsules 150 mg than in patients receiving warfarin (6.6% vs 4.2%, respectively).

The risk of major bleeds was similar with dabigatran etexilate capsules 150 mg and warfarin across major subgroups defined by baseline characteristics (see Figure 1), with the exception of age, where there was a trend toward a higher incidence of major bleeding on dabigatran etexilate capsules (hazard ratio 1.2, 95% CI: 1.0 to 1.5) for patients ≥ 75 years of age.

### The predictive value of circulating gal-3 for new stroke events in paroxysmal atrial fibrillation patients despite oral anticoagulation medications [^112RJUQ6]. Clinical Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

3 Results

3.1 Serum Gal‐3 Level Was Significantly Elevated in Incident Stroke in Patients With Nonvalvular AF

In the present study, we consecutively enrolled 197 nonvalvular paroxysmal AF patients. Among them, 153 patients received radiofrequency ablation. Five out of 197 patients did not receive anticoagulation therapy throughout the follow‐up period, as their CHA2DS2‐VASc scores were < 2 (four patients had a score of 1, and one had a score of 0). Another 41 patients with a CHA2DS2‐VASc score of ≤ 1 (32 patients with a score of 1 and 10 with a score of 0) initially received anticoagulation therapy as they underwent radiofrequency ablation. We discontinued their oral anticoagulation 3 months after the ablation procedure, with exceptions to five patients who experienced recurrent AF episodes after the blanking period during follow‐up.

During a 4‐year follow‐up period, 25 patients out of a total cohort of 197 nonvalvular AF patients (mean [SE] age, 66.9 (10.1) years, 111 men [weighted 56.35%]) developed stroke events. Demographic, clinical, and biochemical data for the study population, stratified according to the presence of incident stroke, are shown in Table 1. Individuals with advanced age, a history of cerebral infarction, renal insufficiency, and receiving antiplatelet therapy were found to have a higher susceptibility to stroke. In addition, participants who experienced stroke consistently demonstrated notably higher CHA2DS2‐VAS scores, uric acid, and brain natriuretic peptide levels (p < 0.05 for all). Among the five patients who did not receive anticoagulation, one patient (with a CHA2DS2‐VASc score of 1) experienced a stroke (5% per year), while 24 out of 192 patients (3.1% per year) who received anticoagulation therapy, with an average CHA2DS2‐VASc score of 4, experienced a stroke.

### The predictive value of circulating gal-3 for new stroke events in paroxysmal atrial fibrillation patients despite oral anticoagulation medications [^115ffd1b]. Clinical Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

Background

CHA2DS2‐VASc is used to assess the risk of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and guide anticoagulant treatment decisions, but it has limitations in accurately predicting stroke risk in individual patients. The objective of this study is to conduct a cohort study by assessing preoperative levels of Gal‐3 in paroxysmal AF patients, aiming to observe its correlation with the subsequent incidence of stroke events.

Method

This study enrolled 197 patients with nonvalvular paroxysmal AF. Blood samples were taken to test Gal‐3 levels. All patients were followed up for 4 years after admission.

Results

Compared to the nonstroke cases, serum levels of Gal‐3 were markedly elevated in stroke cases (7.08 [IQR, 4.60–10.96] vs. 17.34 [IQR, 8.28–20.31], p < 0.001). Gal‐3 yields a superior AUC (0.748, with a 95%CI of 0.681–0.807) compared to other classical stroke indices, such as BNP, CHA2DS2‐Vas score, and TNI. Remarkably, the Gal‐3 index exhibited a superior predictive capacity, yielding a significant incremental predictive value that surpassed the conventional risk factors (CHA2DS2‐VASc score) for stroke events, as evidenced by an IDI of 16.4% (p < 0.001) and an NRI of 34.7% (p = 0.002).

Conclusion

The presence of Gal‐3 is an independent risk factor for stroke in patients with AF. Elevated levels of Gal‐3 have the potential to serve as a valuable biomarker for identifying incident strokes in AF patients. Furthermore, incorporating the assessment of Gal‐3 levels into the conventional CHA2DS2‐VASc score could significantly enhance its predictive accuracy for stroke in AF patients.

### A comparative analysis of HAS-BLED, ORBIT, DOAC, and AF-BLEED bleeding-risk scores in anticoagulated patients with atrial fibrillation: a report from the prospective murcia atrial fibrillation project III (MAFP-III) cohort [^1121BFAx]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Atrial fibrillation (AF) patients often require oral anticoagulation (OAC), but predicting bleeding risk remains challenging. Classic risk scores like HAS-BLED and ORBIT, along with newer models such as DOAC and AF-BLEED, exhibit only modest predictive performance. Herein, we compared these four scores in AF patients on OAC to evaluate their predictive accuracy and clinical utility.

Methods

We included AF patients starting OAC between January 2016 and November 2021. Endpoints assessed were major bleeding, major bleeding/clinically relevant non-major bleeding (CRNMB), and intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). Score performance was assessed through discrimination, calibration, reclassification (NRI), decision curve analysis (DCA), and accuracy over a two-year follow-up period.

Results

3,259 AF patients were included (median age 77 [IQR 70–83] years, 52.8% female). Over 2-years follow-up, 196 patients (6.35%/year) experienced major bleeding, 413 (10.3%/year) major bleeding/CRNMB, and 32 (0.5%/year) suffered ICH. All risk scores performed modestly for major bleeding (c-indexes < 0.7) with ORBIT (c-index 0.664) and HAS-BLED (c-index 0.651) performing best. All four scores demonstrated good discriminatory ability (log-rank p < 0.001). The ORBIT score showed a slight improvement in NRI for major bleeding compared to HAS-BLED, with a modest increase in discrimination, while no other score outperformed HAS-BLED. Calibration showed that HAS-BLED and ORBIT outperformed the DOAC and AF-BLEED scores for major bleeding and CRNMB. The Brier index indicated high accuracy across all scores.

Conclusion

All bleeding risk scores only had modest predictive ability. None demonstrated clear superiority in predicting major bleeding, major bleeding/CRNMB, or ICH.

### The association of malignancy with stroke and bleeding in atrial fibrillation: a population-based cohort study [^115LNQLR]. JACC: CardioOncology (2025). Medium credibility.

Following this, we stratified the cohort based on malignancy status and compared the HR associated with each level of the CHA 2 DS 2 -VA score relative to a score of 1 to examine if the HRs were different in patients with cancer compared with cancer-free control subjects. The CHA 2 DS 2 -VA score, rather than the CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score, was used because recent data indicate that female sex should not impact the decision to start anticoagulation. Of note, AF cases and control subjects were matched on both the CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score and sex and were therefore also matched on the CHA2DS2-VA score. Next, we conducted 3 analyses limited to subgroups of people with AF and malignancy (with their matched control subjects) to determine the HR for stroke and bleeding associated with these subgroups:

- Men with CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score 1 and women with CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score 2 (henceforth referred to as CHA2DS2-VA score 1). This subgroup was chosen as a cancer diagnosis may have a greater impact on treatment decisions in this subset, which has a Class II recommendation to anticoagulate as per European Society of Cardiology and American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines.
- People whose malignancy was < 1 year before the AF diagnosis date. This was done to enrich the analysis for people with active cancer.
- People with malignancies associated with higher mortality rates (lung, gastrointestinal, leukemia) and those with lower mortality rates (prostate, breast, lymphoma, genitourinary). This was done to explore how the competing risk of death influences the hazard of outcomes.

All analyses were performed using SAS Enterprise Guide 7.1 (SAS Institute). The statistical significance of outcome comparisons between groups was defined as a 2-tailed P value < 0.05. Cells with < 6 individuals are suppressed to reduce the risk of reidentification as per ICES contractual obligations with data providers.

(5)Phenytoin has also been reported to increase in the presence of carbamazepine. Careful monitoring of phenytoin plasma levels following co-medication with carbamazepine is advised.

(6)Following co-administration of carbamazepine 400 mg/day with trazodone 100 mg to 300 mg daily, carbamazepine reduced trough plasma concentrations of trazodone (as well as meta-chlorophenylpiperazine [mCPP]) by 76 and 60% respectively, compared to precarbamazepine values.

(7)Warfarin's anticoagulant effect can be reduced in the presence of carbamazepine.

(8)Concomitant use of carbamazepine with rivaroxaban, apixaban, dabigatran, and edoxaban (direct acting oral anticoagulants) is expected to result in decreased plasma concentrations of these anticoagulants that may be insufficient to achieve the intended therapeutic effect. In general, coadministration of carbamazepine with rivaroxaban, apixaban, dabigatran, and edoxaban should be avoided.

Thus, if a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on one of the agents in this category, and then begins a course of treatment with carbamazepine extended-release capsules, it is reasonable to expect that a dose increase for the concomitant agent may be necessary.

### Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors and arrhythmias: a meta-analysis of 38 randomized controlled trials [^115KRvyS]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The present meta-analysis of 38 RCTs involving 88,704 patients shows that SGLT2i significantly lowered the risk of incident atrial arrhythmia and SCD (Central Illustration). Specifically, we observed that SGLT2i reduced the risk of atrial fibrillation. Additionally, no significant association was found between SGLT2i and the incidence of VAs, and cardiac arrest. The risk of ventricular fibrillation, ventricular flutter, and ventricular tachycardia was comparable between both groups of patients. These findings lend further evidence that SGLT2i therapy can provide clinically relevant risk reductions in atrial arrhythmias and SCD.

Central Illustration
Sodium-Glucose Cotransporter-2 Inhibitors and Arrhythmias: A Meta-Analysis of 38 Randomized Controlled Trials

Abbreviation as in Figure 2.

A meta-analysis by Sfairopoulos et alin 2021 suggested that SGLT2i therapy was not associated with a lower risk of SCD or VAs in patients with T2DM and/or HF and/or CKD. Since the previous meta-analysis in 2021, new data became available from landmark RCTs published such as DELIVER, EMPEROR PRESERVED, DAPA-CKD, and EMPEROR-REDUCED. Our meta-analysis incorporates a substantial body of new evidence derived from these rigorously conducted RCTs. In contrast, our study reported that SGLT2i therapy was associated with a statistically significant reduction in the incidence of SCD in patients with T2DM and/or HF. Another meta-analysis by Oates et al,2023 reported that their analysis did not demonstrate a reduction in the incidence of arrhythmic events (including both atrial arrhythmias and VAs) in patients receiving SGLT2i therapy. Our study shows a significant reduction in the incidence of atrial arrhythmias in patients receiving SGLT2i therapy. Our primary research findings, after including DAPA-CKD, DELIVER, and EMPEROR-Preservedtrials, are consistent with the meta-analysis by Fernandes et al, as both report a lower incidence of atrial arrhythmias and SCD when treated with SGLT2i, indicating the robustness of our results. Health care professionals and policymakers may be more inclined to consider the findings from the study when making decisions about the use of SGLT2i in patients with T2DM, HF, and/or CKD. It also provides additional insights into the effectiveness of different types of SGLT2i in patient populations with T2DM or HF.

### Warfarin sodium (Jantoven) [^116MdKTH]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.8 Other Clinical Settings with Increased Risks

In the following clinical settings, the risks of JANTOVEN therapy may be increased:

Moderate to severe hepatic impairment
Infectious diseases or disturbances of intestinal flora (e.g., sprue, antibiotic therapy)
Use of an indwelling catheter
Severe to moderate hypertension
Deficiency in protein C-mediated anticoagulant response: JANTOVEN reduces the synthesis of the naturally occurring anticoagulants, protein C and protein S. Hereditary or acquired deficiencies of protein C or its cofactor, protein S, have been associated with tissue necrosis following warfarin administration. Concomitant anticoagulation therapy with heparin for 5 to 7 days during initiation of therapy with JANTOVEN may minimize the incidence of tissue necrosis in these patients.
Eye surgery: In cataract surgery, JANTOVEN use was associated with a significant increase in minor complications of sharp needle and local anesthesia block but not associated with potentially sight-threatening operative hemorrhagic complications. As JANTOVEN cessation or reduction may lead to serious thromboembolic complications, the decision to discontinue JANTOVEN before a relatively less invasive and complex eye surgery, such as lens surgery, should be based upon the risks of anticoagulant therapy weighed against the benefits.
Polycythemia vera
Vasculitis
Diabetes mellitus

5.9 Endogenous Factors Affecting INR

The following factors may be responsible for increased INR response: diarrhea, hepatic disorders, poor nutritional state, steatorrhea, or vitamin K deficiency.

The following factors may be responsible for decreased INR response: increased vitamin K intake or hereditary warfarin resistance.

(3)Phenytoin has also been reported to increase in the presence of carbamazepine. Careful monitoring of phenytoin plasma levels following co-medication with carbamazepine is advised.

(4)Following co-administration of carbamazepine 400mg/day with trazodone 100mg to 300mg daily, carbamazepine reduced trough plasma concentrations of trazodone (as well as meta-chlorophenylpiperazine [mCPP]) by 76 and 60% respectively, compared to precarbamazepine values.

The study was designed to compare the efficacy of rivastigmine transdermal system 13.3 mg/ 24 hours versus that of rivastigmine transdermal system 4.6 mg/24 hours during the 24-week double-blind treatment phase.

The ability of the 13.3 mg/24 hours rivastigmine transdermal system to improve cognitive performance versus that provided by the 4.6 mg/24 hours rivastigmine transdermal system was assessed with the Severe Impairment Battery (SIB) which uses a validated 40-item scale developed for the evaluation of the severity of cognitive dysfunction in more advanced AD patients. The domains assessed included social interaction, memory, language, attention, orientation, praxis, visuospatial ability, construction, and orienting to name. The SIB was scored from 0 to 100, with higher scores reflecting higher levels of cognitive ability.

The ability of the 13.3 mg/ 24 hours rivastigmine transdermal system to improve overall function versus that provided by the 4.6 mg/24 hours rivastigmine transdermal system was assessed with the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living-Severe Impairment Version (ADCS-ADL-SIV) which is a caregiver-based ADL scale composed of 19 items developed for use in clinical studies of dementia. It is designed to assess the patient's performance of both basic and instrumental activities of daily living such as those necessary for personal care, communicating and interacting with other people, maintaining a household, conducting hobbies and interests, and making judgments and decisions. A sum score is calculated by adding the scores of the individual items and can range from 0 to 54, with higher scores indicating less functional impairment.

### Alteplase (Activase) [^111nkdSk]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14.1 Acute Ischemic Stroke (AIS)

Two placebo-controlled, double-blind trials (Studies 1 and 2) were conducted in patients with AIS. Both studies enrolled patients with measurable neurological deficit who could complete screening and begin study treatment within 3 hours from symptom onset. A cranial computerized tomography (CT) scan was performed prior to treatment to rule out the presence of intracranial hemorrhage. Blood pressure was actively controlled (185/110 mm Hg or lower) for 24 hours.

Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive either 0.9 mg/kg Activase (maximum of 90 mg) or placebo. Activase was administered as a 10% initial IV bolus over 1 minute followed by continuous IV infusion of the remainder over 60 minutes. Study treatment was initiated prior to the availability of coagulation study results in patients without recent use of oral anticoagulants and/or heparin and was discontinued if the pretreatment prothrombin time (PT) was greater than 15 seconds or the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) was elevated. Patients with prior aspirin use were included. Administration of anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents was prohibited for the first 24 hours following symptom onset.

Study 1 (n = 291) evaluated neurological improvement at 24 hours after stroke onset. The primary endpoint, the proportion of patients with a 4 point or greater improvement in the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score or complete recovery (NIHSS score of 0), was not significantly different between treatment groups. A prespecified secondary analysis suggested improved 3-month outcome associated with Activase treatment using the following stroke assessment scales: Barthel Index, Modified Rankin Scale, Glasgow Outcome Scale, and the NIHSS.

### AGA clinical practice guideline on management of gastroparesis [^114kdfou]. Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for gastroparesis, more specifically with respect to prokinetics and antiemetics, AGA 2025 guidelines recommend to consider offering erythromycin in patients with GP.
Recognize that erythromycin improves symptoms of GP due to its gastric prokinetic effects rather than a direct antiemetic effect. Recognize that erythromycin's effects on symptoms and gastric motility are through its motilin receptor agonist properties and are unrelated to its antibiotic properties. Administer low doses, such as 40–150 mg PO, 30 minutes before meals, to reduce potential adverse effects seen with higher doses, such as 250–500 mg. Use erythromycin ethylsuccinate oral suspension to administer smaller, better-tolerated doses, as erythromycin tablets are only available in high doses. Recognize that tachyphylaxis often develops with prolonged, continuous use of erythromycin; maintain efficacy using drug holidays, such as 3 weeks on therapy, 1 week off therapy. Be aware of safety concerns with erythromycin, including the development of antibiotic resistance with long-term use, drug interactions as it is a CYP3A isoform inhibitor, and QT-prolongation. Consider using azithromycin as a substitute for erythromycin, with similar safety considerations, such as antibiotic resistance.

### Exenatide (Byetta) [^116EZt7e]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Oral Contraceptives

The effect of BYETTA (10 mcg BID) on single and on multiple doses of a combination oral contraceptive (30 mcg ethinyl estradiol plus 150 mcg levonorgestrel) was studied in healthy female subjects. Repeated daily doses of the oral contraceptive (OC) given 30 minutes after BYETTA administration decreased the Cmaxof ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel by 45% and 27%, respectively, and delayed the Tmaxof ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel by 3.0 hours and 3.5 hours, respectively, as compared to the oral contraceptive administered alone. Administration of repeated daily doses of the OC one hour prior to BYETTA administration decreased the mean Cmaxof ethinyl estradiol by 15% but the mean Cmaxof levonorgestrel was not significantly changed as compared to when the OC was given alone. BYETTA did not alter the mean trough concentrations of levonorgestrel after repeated daily dosing of the oral contraceptive for both regimens. However, the mean trough concentration of ethinyl estradiol was increased by 20% when the OC was administered 30 minutes after BYETTA administration injection as compared to when the OC was given alone. The effect of BYETTA on OC pharmacokinetics is confounded by the possible food effect on OC in this study. Therefore, OC products should be administered at least one hour prior to BYETTA injection.

Warfarin

Administration of warfarin (25 mg) 35 minutes after repeated doses of BYETTA (5 mcg BID on Days 1–2 and 10 mcg BID on Days 3–9) in healthy volunteers delayed warfarin Tmaxby approximately 2 hours. No clinically relevant effects on Cmaxor AUC of S - and R -enantiomers of warfarin were observed. BYETTA did not significantly alter the pharmacodynamic properties (e.g., international normalized ratio) of warfarin [see Drug Interactions (7)].

### Net benefit of anticoagulation in subclinical device-detected atrial fibrillation… [^114cKWRD]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Exposure Anticoagulation was modeled to decrease the risk of ischemic stroke by 32% and increase the risk of major bleeding by 62%. In probabilistic sensitivity analyses, the 95% CIs for treatment effect sizes were also considered. Main Outcomes and Measures The main outcome measure for overall net benefit was the cumulative quality-adjusted life-years during the simulation. The model considered the number and severity of ischemic strokes, hemorrhagic strokes, other intracranial bleeds, and extracranial bleeds, as well as the number of deaths during a 10-year simulation. Per patient, these differences translated to approximately 1 additional quality-adjusted week of life with NOAC treatment during the 10-year simulation. When the 95% CIs of treatment effect sizes were considered in probabilistic sensitivity analysis, there was a 65. 8% probability that NOAC treatment leads to more QALYs than withholding treatment.

Recently, 2 randomized trials, Non–Vitamin K Antagonist Oral Anticoagulants in Patients With Atrial High Rate Episodes and Apixaban for the Reduction of Thrombo-Embolism in Patients With Device-Detected Sub-Clinical Atrial Fibrillation, evaluated the benefit of NOACs in patients with device-detected subclinical AF. The NOAH-AFNET 6 was halted prematurely due to safety concerns with a 2-fold increase in major bleeding with NOAC therapy and no statistically significant difference in stroke rates. 3 In contrast, the ARTESiA trial reported that anticoagulation significantly reduced the risk of ischemic stroke at the expense of a higher bleeding rate. 4 The absolute rate of stroke was lower than expected in both trials, at approximately 1 stroke per 100 patient-years.

While initially the results of these 2 studies appeared to be discordant, their study-level meta-analysis demonstrated that, in fact, the treatment effect was consistent between the trials and reported a 32% decrease in the risk of ischemic stroke with NOACs, with a tradeoff of a 62% higher risk. The pooled point risk estimates of the meta-analysis combining the 2 trials were used as the effect sizes for anticoagulation on stroke and major bleeding. 5 The NOAH-AFNET 6 trial did not report rates for specific bleeding subtypes, and the ARTESiA trial did not observe a statistically significant increase in intracranial bleeding with anticoagulation. However, both trials were underpowered to detect significant differences in the bleeding subtypes, and the interpretation of the bleeding risk estimates of the ARTESiA trial is hampered since it had aspirin as the comparator group instead of placebo. 30 That said, in addition to the point estimates of the ARTESiA trial.

The outcome of different weights was tested in the sensitivity analyses. Following all major bleeding events in patients receiving anticoagulation therapy, anticoagulation was temporarily paused for 1 month in the model. Anticoagulation was not observed to significantly affect mortality in the 2 trials nor in their meta-analysis, and thus the same mortality rates were used for the anticoagulation and nonanticoagulation groups of the model. 5 The initial 30-day mortality related to stroke and bleeding events was included in the model. The model used a 1-month cycle length, and all previously mentioned figures were transformed into 1-month probabilities. The simulation was run for a 10-year period with 10 000 samples in both decision groups. As the primary outcome measure, cumulative QALYs were compared between individuals initially chosen to start anticoagulant therapy and those who were not.

### Decision support intervention and anticoagulation for emergency department atrial fibrillation… [^117VgPSQ]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

The Clinical Decision Support to Optimize Care of Patients With Atrial Fibrillation or Flutter in the Emergency Department pragmatic, stepped-wedge cluster randomized clinical trial was conducted from July 1, 2021, through April 30, 2023, at 13 community medical centers of an integrated health system in Northern California. The study included adult ED patients with primary AFF eligible for anticoagulation initiation when discharged home. Clusters were randomly assigned to staggered dates for 1-way crossover from the control phase to the intervention phase. Intervention Physician education, facility-specific audit and feedback, and access to decision support, which identified eligible patients and recommended shared decision-making, anticoagulation initiation, and timely follow-up. Main Outcomes and Measures The main outcome was a composite of anticoagulation on discharge or within 30 days.

A primary intention-to-treat analysis and a secondary per-protocol analysis were performed. Multivariable analyses adjusted for intervention and exposure months with random effects, accounting for clustering by facility and patient. Among the 387 patients with an initiation-eligible control encounter, 244 received anticoagulation. Among the 816 patients with an initiation-eligible intervention encounter, 558 received anticoagulation. There was no statistically significant change in initiation of anticoagulation associated with the intervention. Decision support was used for 217 eligible case patients and was associated with a statistically significant change in anticoagulation initiation when compared with 599 patients for whom decision support was not used. Conclusions and Relevance In this trial, a multipronged intervention to facilitate thromboprophylaxis among eligible ED patients with AFF did not significantly increase anticoagulation initiation. Opportunities exist to further improve stroke prevention among ED patients with primary AFF. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials. gov Identifier: NCT05009225. Physicians were encouraged to have a shared decision-making conversation with at-risk patients about stroke prevention and to facilitate timely outpatient follow-up. To test the effectiveness of the intervention, we undertook this pragmatic, stepped-wedge cluster randomized clinical trial across 13 community EDs, examining OAC initiation among eligible patients on ED discharge and in the subsequent 30 days.

We performed both a primary intention-to-treat analysis of the intervention that included CDSS access and a secondary per-protocol analysis of CDSS use vs nonuse during the intervention phase. In this pragmatic trial, we designed the intervention to be low intensity with minimal disruption of customary clinical patterns of care, closer to usual than ideal care. 29 The trial protocol is presented in Supplement 2. The Kaiser Permanente Northern California Institutional Review Board approved the study with a waiver of informed patient consent because it was determined to be minimal risk. This study followed the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials guideline extension for stepped-wedge cluster randomized clinical trials.
30. After an initial study period of 3 months in which all clusters were in the control phase, the intervention was implemented in 1 cluster per step at 1-month intervals, starting in October 2021.

### Anticoagulation vs. aspirin plus clopidogrel for atrial fibrillation… [^111hjYEE]. AAFP (2006). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation is a common cardiac arrhythmia that increases the risk of stroke and other vascular events. Oral anticoagulation is more effective at preventing vascular complications than aspirin, but it is associated with a significantly increased risk of major bleeding complications. ACTIVE W was designed to compare oral anticoagulation with aspirin plus clopidogrel in preventing vascular complications from atrial fibrillation. The study included 6, 706 patients who had atrial fibrillation plus at least one risk factor for stroke. Patients were excluded if they had contraindications to study medications, peptic ulcer disease, mitral stenosis, thrombocytopenia, or previous intracerebral hemorrhage.

Study participants were randomly assigned to receive clopidogrel plus aspirin or oral anticoagulation sufficient to maintain an International Normalized Ratio between 2. 0 and 3.
0. The INR was monitored monthly in the anticoagulation group. The primary outcome was occurrence of stroke, systemic embolism, myocardial infarction, or vascular death. Patients were monitored for bleeding events and adverse effects from study medications. The 3, 335 patients assigned to clopidogrel plus aspirin were comparable to the 3, 371 assigned to oral anticoagulation. The average age of study participants was 70 years, and about 60 percent reported atrial fibrillation for more than two years. More than one fourth had documented coronary artery disease, and 15 percent reported previous stroke or TIA.

Beta blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors were used by more than one half of study participants, digoxin by more than one third, and statins by about 37 percent. The study was discontinued early because anticoagulation therapy was clearly superior. The 164 events in patients treated with anticoagulation were equivalent to a 3. 9 percent annual risk, compared with 234 events equivalent to a
5. 6 percent annual risk in patients treated with aspirin plus clopidogrel. Although the anticoagulation group had an advantage in all outcomes, the greatest reduction was in stroke. Oral anticoagulation significantly reduced all types of stroke and appeared significantly more likely to prevent minor events. The rates of major hemorrhage were similar in both treatment groups, but minor bleeding was significantly more common during aspirin plus clopidogrel therapy.

The lowest discontinuation rates and best outcomes occurred in a subgroup already taking anticoagulation on entry to the study. The authors conclude that oral anticoagulation is superior to aspirin plus clopidogrel in preventing vascular complications of atrial fibrillation, especially stroke. They calculate a reduction of one stroke plus two major vascular events or major bleeds per 100 patient-years with oral anticoagulation therapy.

### Anticoagulation in patients with atrial fibrillation… [^116sNBcB]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

Although anticoagulation decreases the risk of stroke by about two thirds in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, this therapy continues to be significantly underused. Current guidelines for clinical practice are complex and may appear confusing and inconsistent to physicians. Thomson and colleagues used a systematic literature review to develop a decision analysis model for the use of anticoagulants in patients with atrial fibrillation and applied the model to data on more than 200 patients. Published studies were identified through MEDLINE and other databases, and were appraised using the criteria of the Evidence-Based Medicine Working Group. When possible, original data were reanalyzed to meet objective end points. Overall, the data indicated that anticoagulated patients had 42 percent of the stroke risk of placebo-treated patients. Large community-based studies were used to calculate risk of death, disability and subsequent stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation.

Interviews with 57 patients with atrial fibrillation were used to provide data on quality of life associated with different health states. Finally, cost estimates were formulated for stroke and for anticoagulant therapy and its complications. The treatment decisions were modeled as a Markov process using a hypothetic cohort of patients followed over several time cycles. All assumptions were made to replicate, as closely as possible, a real practice situation. If necessary, a group consensus model was used to make or validate these assumptions. The model indicated that warfarin should be used in all patients with atrial fibrillation who had three or more risk factors for stroke. In men with atrial fibrillation, warfarin should be used whenever left ventricular hypertrophy and at least one other risk factor are present. Aspirin therapy should be considered in patients with atrial fibrillation who have contraindications to warfarin or anticoagulation.

The authors also prepared a set of decision tables to help physicians determine the risks and likely benefits of warfarin therapy in individual patients based on age, sex, blood pressure and risk factors such as smoking or diabetes.

Importance Patients with atrial fibrillation are at a proportionally higher risk of stroke based on accumulation of well-defined risk factors. The study cohort comprised 429 417 outpatients with AF. Their mean age was 71. 3 years, and
55. 8% were male. Prescribed treatment consisted of an OAC, aspirin only, aspirin plus a thienopyridine, or no antithrombotic therapy. Overall, OAC prescription prevalence did not exceed 50% even in higher-risk patients with a CHADS2 score exceeding 3 or a CHA2DS2-VASc score exceeding 4.

Conclusions and Relevance In a large quality improvement registry of outpatients with AF, prescription of OAC therapy increased with a higher CHADS2 score and CHA2DS2-VASc score. However, a plateau of OAC prescription was observed, with less than half of high-risk patients receiving an OAC prescription. We evaluated the prevalence of OAC prescription by cardiovascular specialists in a cohort of outpatients using data from the American College of Cardiology's National Cardiovascular Data Registry Practice Innovation and Clinical Excellence Registry. The use of this prospective national registry of cardiovascular care in the United States provides a unique opportunity to examine patterns of OAC treatment in routine practice among outpatients. Therefore, our final study cohort comprised 429 417 patients with AF from 144 practices in 38 states across the United States.

We characterized the study cohort using 2 different metrics to estimate thromboembolic risk in patients with AF. First, we used the traditional CHADS2 score. To investigate the independent associations of the CHADS2 score and the CHA2DS2-VASc score as continuous variables with the outcome of antithrombotic therapy prescription, we constructed multinomial logistic regression models adjusted for patient demographic, clinical, and practice characteristics. These models included site as a random effect to account for patient clustering within sites. Of the total cohort, 111 134 patients were prescribed aspirin only, 23 454 patients were prescribed aspirin plus thienopyridine dual antiplatelet therapy, and 102 229 patients were prescribed no antithrombotic therapy.

Patients with AF with a CHADS2 score of 3 and a CHA2DS2-VASc score of 5 were most often prescribed anticoagulation at 50. 6% and
49. 7%, respectively. Oral anticoagulant prescription did not exceed 50% even in higher-risk patients, including patients with AF with a CHADS2 score exceeding 3 or a CHA2DS2-VASc score exceeding 4. Evaluation of practice-level variation of OAC prescription revealed that the median practice rate for OAC prescription was
51. 7%. There was significant variation in OAC prescription, with an interquartile range of 37. 7% to
58. 3%. In both unadjusted and multivariable-adjusted analyses, each 1-point increase in the CHADS2 score and the CHA2DS2-VASc score was significantly associated with greater odds of both antiplatelet therapy and OAC prescription. Notably, for each 1-point increase in the CHADS2 score, patients with AF had a 16. 6% greater odds of OAC prescription vs no antithrombotic therapy prescription (adjusted odds ratio, 1.
