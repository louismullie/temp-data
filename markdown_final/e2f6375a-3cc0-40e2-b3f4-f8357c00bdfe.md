## Question

A 22-year-old reports a solitary salmon-colored "herald patch" on the trunk that enlarges over a few days, followed over the coming weeks by a pattern of smaller lesions on the chest, abdomen, and back — how should this be interpreted?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to interpret a 22-year-old presenting with a solitary salmon-colored herald patch on the trunk that enlarges and is followed by smaller lesions on the chest, abdomen, and back, and what the plan should be. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether this morphology and chronology fit classic pityriasis rosea. Then, I should verify epidemiology and natural history for plausibility. Next, I will examine key differentials and what bedside or ancillary checks would help exclude them. After that, I need to outline a pragmatic diagnostic and management plan, including when to treat, when to test, and when to biopsy. Finally, I will consider counseling points, special situations, and red flags that would alter management, making sure I cross-check each step against the literature before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the pattern-matching. A single enlarging, oval, salmon-pink "herald patch" on the trunk with a peripheral collarette of scale, followed 1–2 weeks later by multiple smaller oval scaly plaques that align along Langer lines in a "Christmas tree" distribution, is textbook pityriasis rosea in a young adult, and the temporal sequence here mirrors that description closely [^112uqL6p] [^114gZC76] [^112g2LA6].

> I should confirm epidemiologic plausibility and expected course. PR predominantly affects adolescents and young adults, often with minimal systemic symptoms, and typically resolves spontaneously within about 6–8 weeks; this patient's age of 22 years fits the peak incidence, making PR the leading consideration given the described morphology and evolution [^114gZC76] [^111e5nQG].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to check mimics that can present with annular or scaly plaques on the trunk. Tinea corporis can mimic a herald patch, but the subsequent "shower" of smaller lesions in Langer-line distribution with collarette scale and the characteristic PR chronology strongly favor PR; if clinical uncertainty remains, a bedside KOH from an active scaly edge can help exclude dermatophyte infection before starting steroids that could mask tinea, and dermoscopy or histology can support PR if needed [^11353XY6] [^117WmMzT] [^117SWeRz].

> But wait, what if this is secondary syphilis presenting with a symmetric papulosquamous trunk rash. I should double-check for features like involvement of palms and soles, mucous patches, generalized lymphadenopathy, and a relevant sexual exposure history; if atypical features exist or there is any diagnostic doubt, obtaining a nontreponemal test such as RPR with treponemal confirmation is prudent to avoid a missed systemic infection in a PR mimic [^1158uASm].

> I will now examine the possibility of a PR-like drug eruption, which can look similar yet tends to be more pruritic, dusky or violaceous, confluent, and often involves nonclassical sites like the face and extremities. Let me think about the medication history, including biologics, TKIs, ACE inhibitors, NSAIDs, and newer agents, because withdrawal of a culprit drug may be indicated if a PR-like reaction is suspected rather than idiopathic PR, and clinical clues plus, when feasible, evaluation for HHV-6/7 reactivation can aid distinction [^113dD2RZ] [^112LWdwM] [^113M733a].

> Next, I should review bedside tools that can strengthen the clinical diagnosis. Dermoscopy in PR often shows a peripheral whitish "collarette" scale with dotted vessels in a patchy or irregular distribution over a yellowish background, which helps differentiate from psoriasis where dotted vessels are regularly distributed; these patterns also hold in darker skin phototypes and can obviate biopsy in typical cases, though I need to verify findings lesion by lesion [^11353XY6] [^116wdZGm] [^111NecfH].

> If atypical features arise or the course is prolonged, I should confirm with tissue or noninvasive imaging. Histopathology classically shows a subacute spongiotic dermatitis with focal parakeratosis, mild acanthosis, and papillary dermal extravasated erythrocytes, while LC-OCT can noninvasively demonstrate correlating spongiotic and parakeratotic changes, helping exclude psoriasis and eczematous mimics in real time; I should verify that any biopsy is taken from an early secondary lesion or the herald patch to maximize yield [^117SWeRz] [^117WmMzT].

> Let me outline management, but first I should ensure the diagnosis is indeed classic. For typical PR in a healthy 22-year-old, management is usually supportive because the eruption is self-limited; mid- to high-potency topical corticosteroids and oral antihistamines reduce pruritus, and phototherapy with narrowband UVB can be considered if pruritus or body surface area involvement is substantial. If symptoms are significant or rapid resolution is desired early in the course, short-course oral antivirals such as acyclovir have shown modest reductions in rash duration and symptom burden in small studies; I need to counsel about limited-quality evidence and weigh benefits against pill burden, while ensuring no contraindications [^116aM8rj] [^1158uASm] [^113EwEb3] [^111F7yrR].

> Wait, let me verify the natural history and counseling points. PR is not considered contagious, usually resolves over 6–8 weeks, and recurrence is uncommon; however, I should inform the patient that multiple recurrences can rarely occur and that postinflammatory dyspigmentation may follow, especially in darker skin tones, reassuring that pigment changes typically fade with time [^114gZC76] [^114xHCCU].

> I need to ensure I address special situations and red flags. In early pregnancy, PR — particularly when extensive or accompanied by systemic symptoms — has been associated with increased risk of adverse outcomes, so I would coordinate close obstetric follow-up and consider early antiviral therapy on a case-by-case basis; in all patients, I should re-evaluate if palms, soles, mucosa, or systemic symptoms emerge, or if lesions persist or progress beyond the expected window, prompting reconsideration of the differential and possible testing for infections or drug etiologies, including the recognized PR and PR-like eruptions reported in the setting of SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination without necessarily altering vaccination plans [^117THvRp] [^116PRChK].

> Let me reconsider a potential initial misstep: I briefly thought about pityriasis versicolor given trunk involvement, but that typically presents with hypo- or hyperpigmented macules and fine scale rather than a herald patch and collarette-scaling plaques following cleavage lines, so that line of thought should be deprioritized here while keeping it in mind if pigmentary macules predominate without classic PR chronology [^notfound].

> Pulling this together, I interpret this 22-year-old's presentation as classic pityriasis rosea, given the herald patch followed by a truncal, Langer-line–oriented secondary eruption in the right age group and without alarming systemic features; I should confirm the absence of atypical features and concerning exposures, offer symptomatic therapy, discuss the option of a short antiviral course if early and highly symptomatic, avoid unnecessary testing in typical disease, and set expectations on the benign, self-limited course with clear return precautions if the pattern evolves atypically or persists beyond the usual timeframe [^114gZC76] [^1158uASm] [^111F7yrR].

The most likely diagnosis is **pityriasis rosea**, a self-limited papulosquamous eruption that begins with a herald patch and is followed by smaller lesions in a "Christmas tree" pattern on the trunk and proximal limbs [^114gZC76] [^111e5nQG]. The rash typically **resolves within 6–8 weeks** without scarring [^1158uASm], and management is supportive with topical corticosteroids and antihistamines for pruritus; antivirals may be considered in severe or early cases [^113EwEb3] [^11739hXw]. Key differentials include **secondary syphilis, tinea corporis, guttate psoriasis, and drug eruptions**, which should be excluded with serology, KOH prep, and clinical correlation [^1158uASm].

---

## Clinical features of pityriasis rosea

- **Herald patch**: A single, oval, salmon-colored lesion with a collarette of scale, typically 2–10 cm, appearing on the trunk or proximal limbs [^114gZC76].

- **Secondary eruption**: Multiple smaller, oval, pink or salmon-colored plaques with fine peripheral scaling, appearing 5–14 days after the herald patch [^111e5nQG].

- **Distribution**: Lesions align along cleavage lines, creating a "Christmas tree" pattern on the trunk and proximal limbs [^1158uASm].

- **Pruritus**: Mild to moderate itching, worsened by heat or sweating, occurs in about 25% of cases [^114gZC76].

- **Systemic symptoms**: Mild prodromal symptoms (sore throat, fever, malaise) may precede the rash [^1158uASm].

- **Duration**: Self-limited, resolving within 6–8 weeks without scarring [^1158uASm].

---

## Etiology and pathogenesis

Viral association involves reactivation of **HHV-6 and HHV-7**, though the exact cause remains uncertain [^111e5nQG] [^115XGHmY]. The **immune response** is predominantly T-cell-mediated [^1119QddJ].

---

## Differential diagnosis

Key mimics of **pityriasis rosea** to consider include:

| **Condition** | **Distinguishing features** | **Diagnostic tests** |
|-|-|-|
| Secondary syphilis | - Generalized rash including palms/soles <br/> - Lymphadenopathy <br/> - No herald patch | Rapid plasma reagin (RPR) test [^1158uASm] |
| Tinea corporis | Annular lesions with central clearing | KOH preparation [^1158uASm] |
| Guttate psoriasis | - Small, drop-like lesions <br/> - Thicker silvery scales | - Clinical history <br/> - Biopsy [^11353XY6] |
| Drug eruption | - Recent medication use <br/> - Atypical distribution | - Medication history <br/> - Clinical correlation [^113dD2RZ] |

---

## Diagnostic approach

Diagnosis is **primarily clinical**, based on the characteristic herald patch followed by typical secondary lesions. Laboratory tests are not routinely required; obtain an RPR or perform a KOH prep if the presentation is atypical [^1158uASm]. Histopathology is rarely needed. When performed, it shows focal parakeratosis, mild acanthosis, and a lymphocytic infiltrate [^117SWeRz].

---

## Management and treatment

- **Supportive care**: Topical corticosteroids and oral antihistamines for pruritus [^1158uASm] [^116aM8rj].

- **Antivirals**: Acyclovir or valacyclovir may shorten duration in severe or early cases [^113EwEb3] [^112EzdgL] [^111F7yrR].

- **Phototherapy**: Narrow-band UVB for severe or persistent cases [^113EwEb3] [^1158uASm].

---

## Prognosis and complications

Prognosis is **excellent** [^1158uASm], with resolution within 6–8 weeks without scarring. Complications are rare; **post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation** may occur, especially in darker skin tones [^112sJrgp].

---

## Patient education and counseling

- **Self-limited nature**: Reassure patients that the condition resolves spontaneously [^1158uASm].

- **Non-contagious**: PR is not contagious [^1158uASm].

- **Symptom management**: Advise on topical corticosteroids, antihistamines, and avoiding heat/sweating [^1158uASm] [^116aM8rj].

- **Follow-up**: Schedule follow-up to monitor resolution and address concerns [^1158uASm].

---

The most likely diagnosis is **pityriasis rosea**, characterized by a herald patch followed by a "Christmas tree" pattern of lesions. It is self-limited, resolving in 6–8 weeks, and managed with supportive care; antivirals may be used in severe cases [^114gZC76].

PR is an acute, self-resolving exanthem that often does not necessitate treatment. However, in some cases, it may be very symptomatic and cover a large body surface area, necessitating effective and fast-acting treatment options. We presented the cases of three patients with PR who were treated with antivirals (valacyclovir and acyclovir) that all resolved in two to three weeks when watchful management led to worsening symptoms. Larger studies are warranted to further elucidate antiviral efficacy and optimal timing of use, early versus late in the course of the disease, as well as the effect on pregnancy outcomes in patients with PR. The findings of this study suggest that the use of antivirals could be a cost-effective first-line treatment option for patients with severe or recalcitrant PR, as well as an option for those with early signs and symptoms to shorten the course of the disease.

### The use of antivirals in severe or recalcitrant cases of pityriasis rosea: A case series [^113EwEb3]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Low credibility.

Symptomatic treatment options for pityriasis rosea (PR) often include oral antihistamines, topical corticosteroids, or topical calamine, and possibly phototherapy. Although treatment with oral antihistamines or topical corticosteroids/calamine alone does not seem to impact the trajectory of the eruption, these were shown to improve symptoms such as pruritus. Phototherapy with narrow-band UV-B has also been proposed as a possible treatment option; however, this may require three sessions per week for at least one month, which would be inconvenient and costly for many patients. Thus, although these options remain important and cost-effective adjuncts for the treatment of PR, they may not adequately halt the spread of the eruption.

Although antivirals have been shown to have efficacy and alter the course of PR, they are often overlooked as an initial treatment option. In multiple studies, acyclovir led to improvement over placebo in erythema during the first four weeks of follow-up, scaling during the first three weeks, and symptoms during the first two weeks. Specifically, it is hypothesized that during the initial stages of the eruption, the viral replicative activity is highest, thus emphasizing the importance and efficacy of an earlier intervention. When choosing a dosing regimen, it has been shown that low-dose acyclovir (400 mg three times daily for seven days) was as effective in decreasing rash duration and pruritus as high-dose acyclovir (800 mg three times daily for seven days or 400 mg five times daily for seven days). In fact, when examining complete regression after seven days, some studies found that the low-dose regimen was…

### Beyond the herald patch: Exploring the complex landscape of pityriasis rosea [^112uqL6p]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). Low credibility.

Pityriasis rosea (PR) is often clinically identified by the presence of a "herald patch", which is typically a single, large, slightly raised, oval or round erythematous scaly patch that appears on the trunk or neck. This patch is usually pink or salmon-colored, ranging from 2 to 10 centimeters in diameter, and is observed in 50–90% of patients. Within a few days to 2 weeks after the herald patch appears, multiple smaller scaly, oval, pink, or salmon-colored plaques with fine scaling edges develop. These secondary lesions often align along the cleavage lines of the trunk and limbs, creating a characteristic "Christmas tree" pattern.

While the rash primarily affects the trunk and limbs, it can also appear on the neck, arms, and legs, though it rarely involves the face, palms, or soles. These lesions present as elliptical or oval macules and papules, exhibiting fine scaling and a central wrinkling that resembles cigarette paper. A distinctive feature of PR is the collarette scale appearance, where the scale is attached at the periphery but lifted near the center. The distribution of lesions is generally bilateral and diffuse, with the long axis parallel to the skin tension lines.

### Line-field confocal optical coherence tomography assessment of pityriasis rosea [^117SWeRz]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

The histologic diagnosis from the punch biopsy revealed a subacute spongiotic process (Fig 4) with epidermal hyperkeratosis, acanthosis, and mild spongiosis. Foci of parakeratosis were observed, accompanied by mild infiltration of mononuclear cells and extravasation of erythrocytes within the papillary dermis. These spongiotic dermatitis features are consistent with pityriasis rosea (PR) based on the clinical presentation.

### Pityriasis rosea, pityriasis rosea-like eruptions, and herpes zoster in the setting of COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccination [^116PRChK]. Clinics in Dermatology (2022). Low credibility.

Pityriasis rosea (PR), PR-like eruptions (PR-LE), and herpes zoster have been frequently reported during the COVID-19 pandemic and following COVID-19 vaccination. PR is a self-limiting exanthematous disease and herpes zoster is a treatable condition; therefore, their occurrence does not require discontinuation of the vaccination schedule. PR-LE is a hypersensitivity reaction and is, therefore, less predictable in its course.

In the case of a booster dose, the clinical manifestation may not recur, may be different from PR-LE, or may present with systemic symptoms. However, in the case of PR-LE, the possibility of mild and predominantly cutaneous adverse events should not discourage all eligible candidates from receiving and completing the COVID-19 vaccination program, as such adverse reactions represent a small risk considering the possible severe and fatal outcome of COVID-19.

We emphasize the relevance of looking for any viral reactivation in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 who have skin eruptions. The search for viral reactivations could be useful not only for distinguishing between PR and PR-LE but also because viral reactivations may contribute to a patient's systemic inflammation and influence the course of the disease.

### Relaxed constraint and functional divergence of the progesterone receptor (PGR) in the human stem-lineage [^115TcTNb]. PLOS Genetics (2020). Low credibility.

While isoform switching is ancestral in primates and rodents and thus did not evolve to initiate parturition, there is evidence supporting its role in the initiation of human labor. Furthermore, the role of progesterone in the maintenance of pregnancy up to term is supported by studies showing that disruption of progesterone signaling by the PR-A/PR-B antagonist RU486 at any stage of pregnancy results in myometrial contractions and the initiation of labor in rodents and primates, including humans.

Our observation that the human PR-A is a weaker trans-repressor of PR-B suggests that if isoform switching plays a role in the initiation or progression of parturition, this function may have changed in the human lineage. For example, if repression of PR-B mediated progesterone signaling by PR-A is important for initiating parturition at term, as proposed by the isoform switching hypothesis, then human PR-A may be less effective at inhibiting progesterone signaling and initiating parturition than PR-A of other species.

- **Model of progesterone receptor action under the isoform switching hypothesis**: Progesterone signaling through PR-B promotes the maintenance of pregnancy and inhibits parturition, while PR-A induces the cessation of pregnancy and parturition by repressing the actions of PR-B. PR-B evolved stronger trans-activation ability in the human lineage.

We note, however, that PRs regulate the expression of genes without canonical progesterone response elements in their promoters, which may restrict the ability of PR-A to trans-repress PR-B.

An atypical herald patch may be absent in up to 20% of cases or may appear at unusual sites such as the face, scalp, or genitalia. Inverse PR primarily affects acral and flexural areas, including the axilla, groin, and face. Acral PR features lesions on the palms and soles, necessitating differentiation from conditions like erythema multiforme, syphilis, necrolytic acral erythema, and drug eruptions. Unilateral PR is an extremely rare form in which lesions appear only on one side of the body, observed in both children and adults. Blaschkoid PR follows the lines of Blaschko, which are thought to trace the path of embryonic ectodermal cell migration running along but not crossing the anterior truncal midline. Limb-girdle PR, also known as PR of Vidal, is confined to the shoulders or pelvic girdle, typically affecting the axilla and groins with larger, more annular lesions. Mucosal involvement in PR occurs in about 16% of patients, affecting the oral mucosa with punctate, erosive, bullous, or hemorrhagic lesions, often without symptoms. Localized PR presents with eruptions confined to a specific area of the body.

In individuals with darker skin tones, PR may present differently, more frequently involving the face and manifesting with papular lesions. Additionally, oral ulcers have been reported to occur more often in skin of color patients. These cases tend to be more pruritic, and post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation is a common outcome.

Despite these variations, typical clinical features such as a preceding prodrome, a primary lesion followed by secondary lesions, and coexisting characteristics are observed across different presentations.

### Pityriasis rubra pilaris-like eruption in the setting of transient acantholytic dermatosis [^1149YNw4]. JAAD Case Reports (2019). Low credibility.

Transient acantholytic dermatosis (TAD) is characterized by discrete, pruritic erythematous papules and papulovesicles, commonly found on the trunk of older white men. Lesions can vary from a few to several dozen and may be transient or chronic. Histologically, TAD presents as acantholysis frequently associated with dyskeratosis and may mimic Darier disease, Hailey-Hailey disease, or pemphigus. The exact etiology of TAD is unknown, but it can be associated with excessive heat, perspiration, ultraviolet exposure, and malignancy.

Pityriasis rubra pilaris (PRP) is a rare condition with a similarly unknown etiology. The classic type (type 1) presents as pruritic follicular keratotic papules that coalesce into erythematous or salmon-colored plaques with intervening areas of uninvolved skin. The lesions usually start on the face and scalp and progress caudally, and hyperkeratosis of the palms and soles may develop. The condition frequently progresses to erythroderma. Histopathologic findings of PRP often include psoriasiform hyperplasia with alternating orthokeratosis and parakeratosis in both vertical and horizontal directions and follicular plugging. Acantholytic dyskeratosis in PRP was first described in 1989 by Kao and Sulica and has increasingly been reported as a potential histological feature of PRP. As in TAD, variable patterns of acantholysis, including suprabasal, midepidermal, subcorneal, and follicular, with or without dyskeratosis, have been reported, often in cases of PRP that were originally diagnosed as a different disease. Initial presentation on the trunk, rather than the head and neck, has been speculated to correlate with further developments.

Evaluation, diagnosis, and differential diagnosis:

- **Diagnostic criteria**: Owing to the absence of standardized diagnostic guidelines and the frequent occurrence of atypical cases, Chuh et al. proposed a set of diagnostic criteria for pityriasis rosea. These criteria are categorized into essential, optional, and exclusional clinical features to facilitate accurate diagnosis. The table summarizing these features was not provided in the text, thus has been removed.

- **Dermoscopy as an aid in diagnosis**: Dermoscopy can be a useful tool in the evaluation of pityriasis rosea. The herald patch and the secondary lesions of pityriasis rosea typically show a characteristic peripheral whitish scaling (called a "collarette" sign), as well as dotted vessels, which, in contrast to psoriasis, are distributed in an irregular or focal pattern. Diffuse or localized yellowish-orange structureless areas may also be visible. The central area of the lesion may show less scaling and a more homogeneous appearance. Sometimes, dermoscopy also reveals a faint vascular network or linear vessels within the lesions. These findings can help distinguish pityriasis rosea from other conditions and should be used in conjunction with clinical evaluation.

- **Histopathological findings**: Histopathology can also be used as a diagnostic tool to confirm the diagnosis of pityriasis rosea in atypical cases and help differentiate it from other similar-looking conditions. Common epidermal changes include focal parakeratosis in mounds with exocytosis of lymphocytes, variable spongiosis, mild acanthosis, and a thinned granular layer.

### Beyond the herald patch: Exploring the complex landscape of pityriasis rosea [^115CkZd1]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). Low credibility.

In cases of atypical pityriasis rosea (PR), particularly when systemic symptoms are present or when the herald patch is absent and the exanthem is widespread, it is essential to consider other infectious exanthems in the differential diagnosis. Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) and Parvovirus B19 are two potential infectious agents that can present with exanthems similar to PR.

EBV, a herpesvirus, can cause a variety of dermatological manifestations, including morbilliform, papulovesicular, and petechial eruptions during systemic infection. In some cases, EBV can lead to a florid morbilliform eruption or other atypical exanthems, which may resemble PR. EBV-associated exanthems may also be accompanied by systemic symptoms such as fever, lymphadenopathy, pharyngitis, and fatigue, which can overlap with the prodromal symptoms of PR. A thorough clinical history, including serological testing for EBV (e.g. positive viral capsid antigen IgM in acute infection), can help differentiate EBV-related exanthems from PR in patients presenting with systemic signs.

Similarly, Parvovirus B19 should be considered in patients with an atypical PR-like presentation and systemic involvement. Parvovirus B19 is known to cause erythema infectiosum, which can mimic PR with its characteristic facial rash ('slapped cheek' appearance) and systemic symptoms, such as fever and arthralgia. In some cases, Parvovirus B19 infection can present with a widespread, nonspecific exanthem that can be confused with PR.

### Pityriasis rosea and pityriasis rosea-like eruptions: How to distinguish them [^113dD2RZ]. JAAD Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

To the Editor: We appreciate the article from Bitar et al. on ibrutinib-associated pityriasis rosea (PR)-like rash that allows us to share our experience and make some observations. Recently, we proposed criteria to distinguish PR from PR-like eruptions (Table I). Distinguishing them is of paramount importance, as a typical PR may develop during but independently from a therapy. During PR, a self-limiting exanthematous disease associated with the endogenous systemic reactivation of human herpes virus (HHV)-6 and/or HHV-7, the drug (if indispensable for the health of the patient and except for immunosuppressive therapies that can favor viral reactivation) may be cautiously continued. When the skin rash is diagnosed as a drug reaction with morphological features similar to genuine PR (a PR-like eruption), it is preferable to stop the drug immediately to prevent more dangerous drug reactions.

Indeed, the interesting case described by Bitar et al. has some of the characteristics of PR-like eruptions, such as the presence of itch on the lesions, the dusky-red color of the lesions, and the superficial and perivascular eosinophil infiltration in the dermis. However, it is uncommon after several months to have resolution of the eruption without interruption of the drug. This course of the disease is more typical for PR. Unfortunately, the authors have not investigated potential signs of HHV-6 and HHV-7 reactivation, such as the detection of HHV-6/7 DNA in plasma and the detection of positive IgM antibodies against HHV-6/7 in serum. In addition, they did not refer to peripheral eosinophilia.

### Follicular psoriasis: Differentiation from pityriasis rubra pilaris-an illustrative case and review of the literature [^113LBToY]. Pediatric Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

The follicular presentation of psoriasis is a well-described but uncommon variant. In some cases, follicular psoriasis may clinically and histopathologically mimic pityriasis rubra pilaris. There are several reports discussing the resemblance of widespread follicular psoriasis in children to pityriasis rubra pilaris. We describe a case of follicular psoriasis in a 16-year-old Black girl with acrally distributed follicular hyperkeratotic papules with associated keratoderma of her plantar surfaces, resembling pityriasis rubra pilaris.

### Dupilumab-induced pityriasis rosea in a 28-year-old male with atopic dermatitis [^112SQaT8]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Low credibility.

At the 2-week follow-up visit, the patient wanted to proceed with dupilumab treatment because of the improvement in the recent rash and the reemergence of his eczema. The patient resumed dupilumab at the maintenance dose. However, the same PR-like rash recurred at his following visit. Dupilumab was stopped again, and his PR-like rash resolved while his AD patches remained at this follow-up. Although he had symptoms of headache and fever, our patient's presentation with coalesced plaques on nonclassical regions of PR, including the extremities, and complete resolution of the rash following discontinuation of dupilumab supported the diagnosis of dupilumab-induced PR.

- **Adverse events and safety considerations**: The safety and efficacy of dupilumab for AD have shown promise for extended use, up to 76 weeks. Frequently reported adverse events include injection site reactions, conjunctivitis, and other infections, including upper respiratory tract infections and nasopharyngitis. It is important to differentiate classic PR from a PR-like drug reaction, as classic PR can still develop independently of drug therapy. A PR-like drug reaction is described as more pruritic with confluent lesions that frequently appear on nonclassical regions, including the extremities and face, which resolve within 2 weeks of discontinuation of the causative drug.

- **Other reports**: To our knowledge, there has only been one other report of a PR-like eruption attributed to dupilumab. Other medications reported to induce a PR rash include barbiturates, captopril, isotretinoin, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, and several biologics.

### Neoadjuvant and adjuvant pembrolizumab in advanced high-grade serous carcinoma: the randomized phase II NeoPembrOV clinical trial [^116YW8HW]. Nature Communications (2024). Low credibility.

The study was preregistered on September 7, 2017. Originally, the primary endpoint was CRR after IDS, defined as the removal of all macroscopic residual tumor (CCI = 0; CC0) as assessed by the investigator. This was modified in a protocol amendment on June 3, 2020, to CRR at IDS as assessed by a blinded independent centralized review by two surgical experts and the coordinating investigator, who reviewed the anonymized operative and pathologic reports of all patients at screening, at IDS, and at other debulking surgery.

Secondary efficacy endpoints included the following:

- **CCI score by local assessment**:
	- PCI score by local and central assessment (added at the June 3, 2020 protocol amendment, to be reported separately).

- **ORR after four neoadjuvant cycles**:
	- According to RECIST version 1.1.
	- Best overall response to the global strategy.

- **PFS according to RECIST version 1.1**:
	- Defined as the interval between randomization and date of disease progression or death, whichever occurred first.

- **OS**:
	- Other secondary endpoints included safety during NACT and in the adjuvant setting, postoperative mortality, postoperative morbidity according to modified Clavien-Dindo classification, and pathological complete response (pCR). pCR is not reported as it required a complete examination of the epiploon surgical part, which was not performed by all centers.

### Global warming accelerates soil heterotrophic respiration [^113MLTTf]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Estimating water patch proportionalities from percolation theory: From percolation theory, we expect that the size distribution of water patches n(s) in the domain follows a general proportionality, where s is the water patch size, τ is the Fisher exponent which depends on the dimensionality of the system, and ξ is a cut-off parameter, which depends on the porous medium properties and the saturation degree.

From this definition of n(s), we calculate the characteristic number of patches in the domain using the mean of the distribution function, which yields Γ, where Γ is the gamma function and E_τ is the exponential integral function. From mass conservation, the characteristic patch size is determined.

From percolation simulations, the value of ξ is found to depend on γ = 100. Finally, to account for the total number of water patches in the domain of length scale L, N_c is normalized by ξ, to yield a value where d is the dimensionality (d = 2 for the numerical simulations). According to this formulation, under fully saturated conditions, N_c = 1 (thus a single water cluster) and the characteristic patch S_c has the size of the entire system voids.

### Dupilumab-induced pityriasis rosea in a 28-year-old male with atopic dermatitis [^113M733a]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Low credibility.

To the Editor: We read with great interest the report by Zabel et al. on dupilumab-induced pityriasis rosea (PR). We aim to expand on this finding with our case of dupilumab-induced PR in a 28-year-old male with atopic dermatitis (AD).

A 28-year-old male with a past medical history of asthma and AD presented with diffuse, frequent pruritic flares that did not fully respond to topical steroids, tacrolimus, and ruxolitinib. Given his partial improvement, he was started on dupilumab, the United States Food and Drug Administration-approved medication for AD, with a 600 mg subcutaneous injection and 300 mg every 2 weeks for maintenance. At his 2-week follow-up, the patient endorsed having a fever and headache, which was followed by the development of an enlarging, diffuse itchy rash that was different from his previous AD flares and did not respond to oral antihistamines. The patient denied any shortness of breath, recent travel, sick contacts, or medication changes.

- **Physical examination**: Revealed diffuse erythematous papules coalescing into plaques scattered throughout the body. A punch biopsy was performed, which revealed subacute spongiotic dermatitis with lymphocytic exocytosis, and the periodic acid–Schiff stains were negative for fungi, consistent with the differential diagnosis of PR and AD. The patient was advised to hold the dupilumab and resume previous topical treatments.

### Lichen planopilaris [^1133NqC9]. Dermatologic Therapy (2008). Low credibility.

Lichen planopilaris is a chronic scarring alopecia characterized by follicular hyperkeratosis, perifollicular erythema, and loss of follicular orifices. The scalp lesions may be single or multiple and commonly involve the vertex and parietal area. The hair follicles at the margin of the alopecic patches reveal perifollicular erythema. Anagen hairs can be pulled out easily in active lesions. Associated cutaneous, nail, and mucous membrane lichen planus may be present. Commonly encountered symptoms and signs are increased hair shedding, itching, scaling, burning, and tenderness.

Differentiation from other cicatricial alopecia can be performed through meticulous evaluation of the clinical, histopathologic, and immunohistopathologic findings. Treatment strategies depend on the disease activity and physician expertise. Although there are no definitive curative modalities, some new discoveries and conceptual advances continue to broaden our treatment options for this complex condition.

### Characterization of the inflammatory cell infiltrate in herald patches and fully developed eruptions of pityriasis rosea [^1119QddJ]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Pityriasis rosea (PR) is a common cutaneous papulosquamous disorder affecting young adults. Previous studies have suggested possibilities of a viral etiology and the involvement of cell-mediated immunity, but these remain unproven at the time of writing.

- **Aim**: To elucidate the possible pathomechanisms in PR by characterizing the inflammatory cellular infiltrate in herald patches and fully developed PR eruptions.

- **Methods**: In total, 12 biopsy specimens from 6 patients diagnosed with PR were examined. For each patient, biopsies were taken from both a herald patch and a secondary patch. Specimens were processed for histopathological examination and immunohistochemical staining with a large panel of monoclonal antibodies.

- **Results**: Histopathologically, all specimens showed epidermal changes such as parakeratosis, orthokeratosis, epidermal hyperplasia, and spongiosis. Less common results included epidermal exocytosis and focal parakeratosis. In all biopsies, the dermal infiltrate of lymphocytes stained positively for monoclonal antibodies specific for T cells. The ratio of the CD4+ (helper) vs. CD8+ (cytotoxic) T cells in the dermal infiltrate was increased in most specimens. Increased staining for Langerhans cells was seen within the dermis of lesional skin. There were no marked differences found in histopathology and immunohistochemistry between the herald patch and secondary lesions. Overall, there was a lack of natural killer cell and B-cell activities in PR lesions.

- **Conclusions**: Our results support a predominantly T-cell mediated immunity in the development of PR.

### Prurigo pigmentosa: Case series and differentiation from confluent and reticulated papillomatosis [^112Su6Ej]. JAAD Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Prurigo pigmentosa (PP) is an uncommon, acquired inflammatory disorder predominantly affecting young adults of Asian descent. This condition is characterized by highly pruritic, reticulated, and erythematous papules that resolve with hyperpigmentation. Since its initial description in 1971 by Nagashima et al, multiple cases of PP have been reported; however, this dermatosis is still underdiagnosed or misdiagnosed. The most significant challenge in identifying PP is the successful distinction from confluent and reticulated papillomatosis (CARP). Herein, we describe two patients with PP, focusing on differentiating features from CARP.

### Rethinking pityriasis rubra pilaris as a paraneoplastic syndrome: Two cases of pityriasis rubra pilaris with concomitant underlying malignancy [^113PiGR3]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Low credibility.

The primary therapy for paraneoplastic pityriasis rubra pilaris (PRP) is the treatment of malignancy. One of our cases demonstrated notable improvement of cutaneous symptoms after surgical resection of the breast tumor, although residual flares of PRP were noted afterward. Excimer laser therapy was used due to its documented advantages in clearing persistent psoriatic plaques, with improvement observed after each treatment.

A review of most cases associated with neoplasms has begun to explore whether the diagnosis of PRP could be attributed to a true paraneoplastic cutaneous syndrome. Although rare, establishing PRP as a paraneoplastic process could aid clinicians in diagnosing underlying tumors when fulminant PRP exists.

The diagnosis of PRP is rare, particularly as a paraneoplastic process, and is based on clinical presentation and histopathology. When PRP is recalcitrant to treatment, a paraneoplastic process should be considered based on the patient's history and physical examination. Furthermore, we recommend that patients with adult-onset PRP undergo age-appropriate cancer screenings and obtain thorough skin examinations. Management of paraneoplastic PRP includes treatment of the malignancy and topical or systemic therapies if needed. Due to the significant symptomatology and chronicity, it is vital to recognize the need for further research in this field and delineate specific management protocols.

### Pityriasis rubra pilaris type 1 spontaneously resolving after 20 years [^115verpj]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Pityriasis rubra pilaris (PRP) is an uncommon, idiopathic, papulosquamous eruption. We report a longitudinal study of a patient with PRP type 1 who was treated with retinoid therapy for nine years and whose symptoms resolved spontaneously after 20 years. There are no data in the literature on the disease course of PRP type 1 persisting beyond the usual three years. This case highlights both the extreme chronicity of PRP and the possibility of remission after many years of active disease.

### Accuracy of dermoscopic criteria for the diagnosis of psoriasis, dermatitis, lichen planus and pityriasis rosea [^11353XY6]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Dermoscopy is useful in evaluating skin tumors, but its applicability extends also to the field of inflammatory skin disorders. Plaque psoriasis (PP), dermatitis, lichen planus (LP), and pityriasis rosea (PR) are common inflammatory skin diseases, but little is currently known about their dermoscopic features. The main objective was to determine and compare the dermoscopic patterns associated with PP, dermatitis, LP, and PR, and to assess the validity of certain dermoscopic criteria in the diagnosis of PP.

- **Methods**: Patients with PP, dermatitis, LP, and PR were prospectively enrolled. The single most recently developed lesion was examined dermoscopically and histopathologically. Variables included vascular morphology, vascular arrangement, background color, scale color, scale distribution, and presence of Wickham striae. Univariate and adjusted odds ratios were calculated. Discriminant functions were used to plot receiver-operator characteristic curves.

- **Results**: Eighty-three patients with PP and 86 patients with either dermatitis, LP, or PR were included in the study. Dotted vessels in a regular arrangement over a light red background and white scales were highly predictive for the diagnosis of PP, whereas dermatitis more commonly showed yellow scales and dotted vessels in a patchy arrangement. PR was characterized by a yellowish background, dotted vessels, and peripheral scales; whitish lines (Wickham striae) were seen exclusively in LP.

- **Conclusions**: PP, LP, PR, and dermatitis show specific dermoscopic patterns that may aid their clinical diagnosis. Certain combinations of dermoscopic features can enhance the accuracy of clinical assessments.

### A herald patch almost encircling the trunk-extreme pityriasis rosea gigantea in a young child [^115aWvyN]. Pediatric Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

An 18-month-old girl presented with pityriasis rosea gigantea. The herald patch encircled almost the entire trunk. The distribution of lesions on the trunk and proximal aspects of the limbs, the collarette scaling, the orientation of some lesions along the skin crease lines, and biopsy findings substantiated the diagnosis.

### Oropharyngeal lesions in pityriasis rosea [^1151FfGr]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Pityriasis rosea (PR) is an exanthematous disease associated with the endogenous systemic reactivation of human herpesvirus-6 (HHV-6) and human herpesvirus-7 (HHV-7). Oropharyngeal lesions may be associated with the exanthema, but anecdotal evidence suggests that few dermatologists are aware of their occurrence.

- **Objective**: Classifying oropharyngeal lesions in PR, establishing their prevalence, and assessing their possible association with different PR forms.

- **Methods**: The records of all PR cases diagnosed in the Dermatology Clinic of Genoa University between 2003 and 2016 were retrospectively reviewed to examine sex and age of the patients, PR type, presence of enanthema, systemic symptoms, specific anti-HHV-6 and/or HHV-7 serology, and HHV-6 and/or HHV-7 DNA loads.

- **Results**: The oropharyngeal mucosa was carefully examined in 527 patients with PR. Painless oropharyngeal lesions were observed in 149 patients with PR (28%) and classified as erythematomacular, macular and papular, erythematovesicular, and petechial lesions. The petechial and macular and papular patterns were those most frequently observed. There was no statistically significant difference in the levels of HHV-6 and HHV-7 viremia in the plasma of patients with enanthema and those without.

- **Limitations**: Because this was a retrospective study, biopsies on mucosal lesions were not performed.

- **Conclusion**: Our findings showed that enanthemas are frequently associated with forms of PR different from the classic form.

### Beyond the herald patch: Exploring the complex landscape of pityriasis rosea [^117THvRp]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). Low credibility.

Pityriasis rosea during pregnancy, although rare, has been associated with an increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes, particularly when it occurs in the first trimester. Earlier studies, such as those by Drago et al, reported a higher risk of miscarriage (up to 57–62%) in women who developed PR before the 15th week of gestation, particularly when the rash was extensive or accompanied by systemic symptoms like fever and malaise. However, recent findings offer a more nuanced perspective. Wenger-Oehn et al. conducted a case series involving 46 pregnant women with PR and found a significantly lower rate of unfavorable outcomes (10.9%) compared with a pooled cohort of previous reports (39.6%). Their study highlighted that the timing of PR onset, rash distribution, and the presence of extracutaneous symptoms were key factors influencing pregnancy outcomes, with earlier onset and widespread rash being associated with higher risks.

Despite these concerns, the majority of pregnancies affected by PR result in healthy deliveries. Chuh et al. and other studies have also noted that PR occurring later in pregnancy is typically associated with more favorable outcomes. Given the variability in outcomes, pregnant women with PR, especially those in the early stages of gestation or presenting with widespread rashes or systemic symptoms, should be closely monitored by their healthcare providers.

- **Clinical, histologic, and molecular features of the herald patch**: The herald patch, a hallmark of classic pityriasis rosea (PR), is typically the first lesion to manifest.

### Dermoscopic characterization of guttate psoriasis, pityriasis rosea, and pityriasis lichenoides chronica in dark skin phototypes: An observational study [^116wdZGm]. Dermatologic Therapy (2021). Low credibility.

Dermoscopy as a diagnostic tool is gaining traction in inflammatory dermatoses, with cumulative descriptions of characteristic findings in most dermatoses sometimes obviating the need for a biopsy. In this retrospective observational study, 20 histopathology-confirmed cases each of pityriasis rosea (PR), guttate psoriasis (GP), and pityriasis lichenoides chronica (PLC) seen over a period of three years were included. Dermoscopy images were extracted from photography archives for evaluation, and three lesions from each patient (60 lesions each) were analyzed. Dermoscopic characteristics were compared among PR, GP, and PLC in pairs using the chi-square test, with a P-value of less than .05 considered significant.

The most common background color in PR (86.7%) and PLC (96.7%) was yellow to yellow-orange, while in GP it was dull red to pink (70%). Vessels were visualized in all lesions of GP, with the most characteristic pattern being regular (93.3%) and dotted vessels (95%). In PR, 63.3% of lesions had dotted vessels, mostly in a patchy distribution (56.7%). The most prominent scale color in PR was yellow-white (88.3%), and in GP, it was white-gray (80%). In PLC, varying colors were observed, with brown (53.3%) being the most prominent. Characteristic findings seen only in PLC included hypopigmented areas (13.3%), brown dots and globules (53.3%), and orange-yellow structureless areas (61.7%).

GP, PR, and PLC reveal specific dermoscopic findings that can aid in differentiating them. Furthermore, the known dermoscopic criteria for GP, PR, and PLC also apply to dark skin phototypes.

### Pityriasis rubra pilaris potentially triggered by messenger RNA-1273 COVID vaccine [^1178CULk]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Low credibility.

A 75-year-old, otherwise healthy man presented to his dermatologist with scalp redness and flaking that began several days after his first Moderna vaccination. Seborrheic dermatitis was diagnosed, and ketoconazole 2% shampoo was prescribed. He received his second Moderna vaccination four weeks after the first. Eight days later, he returned to his dermatologist with erythematous patches and plaques on his neck. He denied previous skin issues and any new or chronic medications. There was no family history of pityriasis rubra pilaris (PRP).

Based on the timing relative to the skin complaints, the eruption was attributed to the Moderna vaccine. Topical corticosteroids were prescribed. Over the following weeks, the rash progressed in a cephalocaudal pattern, involving the neck, trunk, and proximal extremities. Initial skin biopsies favored a drug-induced or vaccine-induced reaction. A prednisone taper was prescribed but discontinued by the patient after five days due to minimal improvement and worsening of the rash. Wet wraps over triamcinolone 0.1% ointment offered mild symptomatic improvement. He was referred to our clinic for further evaluation and management.

On presentation, he reported chills without fever and mild itching. He denied joint pain and muscle weakness. Examination showed thin, salmon-colored papules and plaques, with minimal desquamation, on the proximal upper extremities and trunk, confluent over the upper trunk and neck. Well-demarcated areas of unaffected skin (islands of sparing) were appreciated on the torso.

### Beyond the herald patch: Exploring the complex landscape of pityriasis rosea [^114xHCCU]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). Low credibility.

Pityriasis rosea (PR) is a common disorder among children and young adults. However, recurrent pityriasis rosea (rePR) is rare, occurring in only 1–3% of cases. Multiple recurrences, defined as three or more episodes, are extremely uncommon, with only a few patients identified.

Several factors are thought to trigger rePR, including viral reactivation, drug-induced episodes, and immune system alterations. Reactivation of human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) and HHV-7, which are also associated with the initial PR episode, has been identified as a possible cause of recurrence. These viruses may remain dormant and be reactivated by stress or immunosuppression. Certain medications, such as ACE inhibitors, NSAIDs, and some antibiotics, have also been implicated in rePR. These drug-induced cases often mimic idiopathic PR, complicating diagnosis. Additionally, immune system dysfunction, either due to underlying health conditions or external factors such as infections, might contribute to PR recurrence, though this area requires further study.

### Beyond the herald patch: Exploring the complex landscape of pityriasis rosea [^111UtYyW]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). Low credibility.

Pityriasis rosea (PR) is a common, self-limiting dermatological condition characterized by distinctive skin lesions, including a herald patch, followed by secondary eruptions that often form a "Christmas tree" pattern on the trunk. Despite its recognizable clinical presentation, the etiology of PR remains largely uncertain, with hypotheses suggesting both infectious and noninfectious origins. Notably, human herpesviruses (HHV) 6 and 7 have been implicated in its pathogenesis, with evidence pointing to viral reactivation as a potential trigger for the condition.

Epidemiologically, PR predominantly affects children, adolescents, and young adults, with a higher incidence reported in females compared with males. The condition is observed worldwide, with varying incidence rates of around 0.5–2% or greater. In the United States, a study utilizing the All of Us database found that PR affects approximately 0.13% of the population, with a higher prevalence in females and individuals aged 10–29 years. This aligns with global patterns, where PR is more common in younger populations. Seasonal variations have also been noted, with some studies suggesting a higher incidence during the fall and winter months.

In Eastern Anatolia, Turkey, a study analyzing 391 patients with PR from 1992 to 1995 reported an average annual incidence of 0.75 per 100 dermatologic patients, with a slightly higher prevalence in females and a peak incidence in the 20–29 year age group. The incidence was notably higher during the rainy and snowy months. In Kaduna, Nigeria, PR was found in approximately 2.4% of the population examined.

### Beyond the herald patch: Exploring the complex landscape of pityriasis rosea [^114NUWXm]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). Low credibility.

Atypical variants of pityriasis rosea account for approximately 20% of all cases. These variants can differ significantly from the classical presentation due to morphology, size, distribution, course, or symptoms, making diagnosis more challenging. Research suggests that children are more predisposed to atypical variants of pityriasis rosea compared to adults, with atopy playing a possible role.

Atypical pityriasis rosea can present in diverse forms, deviating from the classic herald patch followed by smaller lesions. It may include vesicular, purpuric, urticarial, or papulovesicular lesions and, rarely, erythema multiforme-like or targetoid lesions. The size of these lesions varies, with some significantly smaller or larger than the typical 2–10 cm diameter. Unlike the usual "Christmas tree" pattern, atypical lesions may appear in unusual locations such as the face, palms, soles, or mucous membranes, which are generally spared in classic cases. The rash duration can also differ, sometimes lasting longer than the typical 6–8 weeks or resolving more quickly. While classic pityriasis rosea is often asymptomatic or mildly itchy, atypical forms may present with more severe symptoms, including significant pruritus, especially upon contact with sweat, leading to excoriations, pain, or systemic symptoms like fever and malaise.

### Influence of the occurrence and duration of partial remission on short-term metabolic control in type 1 diabetes: the DIABHONEY pediatric study [^116MBBth]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). High credibility.

To evaluate the residual effect of partial remission (PR) on immediate post-PR glycemic control according to its occurrence and duration in a cohort of children with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), values of glycemic control parameters (i.e. HbA1c, insulin dose-adjusted hemoglobin A1c (IDAA1c), glycemic target-adjusted HbA1c (GTAA1c)) and data from glucose monitoring devices from 189 pediatric patients with new-onset type 1 diabetes were collected retrospectively from 24 months. Patients were characterized according to their remission status (PR+ and PR-). PR+ patients were subdivided into three subgroups regarding PR duration: short (⩾3- ≤ 6 months), intermediate (> 6- ≤ 12 months), and long PR (> 12- ≤ 14 months). We compared glycemic control data from each PR+ subgroup at +6 and +12 months post-PR with PR- patients at the same postdiagnosis time. Second, PR+ subgroups were compared with each other.

PR+ patients showed improved glycemic control (i.e. HbA1c, IDAA1c, and GTAA1c) at +6 months post-PR when compared with non-remitters (PR-), independently of the PR duration subgroups (p < 0.05). Interestingly, patients in the long PR+ subgroup exhibited a higher positive residual effect than the short PR+ subgroup, with lower GTAA1c scores (p = 0.02), better time in range (TIR) (p = 0.003), less time in hypoglycemia (10.45% versus 16.13%, p = 0.03), and less glycemic variability (83.1 mg/dl versus 98.84 mg/dl, p = 0.03). No significant differences were found for glucose control between PR+ and PR- patients at +12 months post-PR.

### Real-life barriers to diagnosis of early mycosis fungoides: An international expert panel discussion [^113mSyyS]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2023). High credibility.

Early mycosis fungoides (MF) lesions can be highly variable in size, shape, thickness, scaling, and color. Although these lesions are more common in sanctuary sites, they can appear in sun-exposed areas, such as the outer aspects of the upper limbs, head, and neck. Clinical manifestations often resemble common benign inflammatory dermatoses (BIDs), including vitiligo, psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, and fungal infections. When clinical presentations are suspected, a thorough scrutiny of the entire skin surface is warranted. Experienced physicians may be able to locate subtle, previously undetected erythematous patches distant from the initial symptomatic site, providing crucial diagnostic information and aiding in biopsy site selection. However, key lesions may be missed, and suboptimal biopsy sites may be chosen if patients do not undress completely for the physical examination.

Early histopathologic features of MF can be variable or less specific. Classical histology reveals superficial lymphoid infiltrates accompanied by epidermotropism, which is the trafficking of neoplastic T cells into the epidermis, manifesting as atypical lymphocytes within the epidermis and as lymphocyte tagging at the dermoepidermal junction. However, the histopathologic findings of early-stage lesions often deviate from this classical pattern, with lymphocytes showing minimal or no atypical features and/or little evidence of epidermotropism. Features that overlap with spongiotic, psoriasiform, or lichenoid dermatitis may also be apparent. Further complicating the diagnosis of MF is the presence of disease variants, three of which are recognized by the World Health Organization: pagetoid reticulosis, granulomatous slack skin, and folliculotropic MF.

### Pityriasis rosea: Diagnosis and treatment [^1158uASm]. American Family Physician (2018). Low credibility.

Pityriasis rosea is a common self-limiting rash that usually starts with a herald patch on the trunk and progresses along the Langer lines to a generalized rash over the trunk and limbs. The diagnosis is based on clinical and physical examination findings. The herald patch is an erythematous lesion with an elevated border and depressed center. The generalized rash usually presents two weeks after the herald patch. Patients can develop general malaise, fatigue, nausea, headaches, joint pain, enlarged lymph nodes, fever, and sore throat before or during the course of the rash.

The differential diagnosis includes secondary syphilis, seborrheic dermatitis, nummular eczema, pityriasis lichenoides chronica, tinea corporis, viral exanthems, lichen planus, and pityriasis rosea-like eruption associated with certain medications.

- **Treatment options include**:
	- Corticosteroids or antihistamines aimed at controlling symptoms.
	- Acyclovir can be used in some cases to treat symptoms and reduce the length of the disease.
	- Ultraviolet phototherapy can also be considered for severe cases.

Pityriasis rosea during pregnancy has been linked to spontaneous abortions.

### Pityriasis rosea-like drug eruption secondary to deucravacitinib [^116RE6C6]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Low credibility.

The reintroduction of deucravacitinib, after the pityriasis rosea-like eruption resolved, was an option and would have permitted a drug "challenge"; however, our patient preferred to pursue an alternative treatment option, given the availability of other effective therapies. The precise mechanism by which deucravacitinib induced a rash in this patient remains uncertain. However, the recognition of a pityriasis rosea-like drug eruption in the context of TYK2 inhibition, coupled with previous reports associated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors and adalimumab, highlights the complex interplay between immune modulation and cutaneous manifestations.

### Relaxed constraint and functional divergence of the progesterone receptor (PGR) in the human stem-lineage [^116HSEec]. PLOS Genetics (2020). Low credibility.

Regardless of the statistical evidence supporting positive selection or relaxed constraint, we found that human PR-A and PR-B have diverged in function compared to the human-chimp ancestor. The trans-activation strength of the AncHuman PR-A is slightly weaker than the AncHominini PR-A, whereas the AncHuman PR-B more strongly trans-activates luciferase expression from the dPRL-332 promoter than the AncHominini PR-B. In addition to acting as a ligand-activated transcriptional activator, PR-A also has the ability to trans-repress the transcriptional activity of PR-B and other nuclear receptors, such as estrogen and glucocorticoid receptors, through its inhibitory function domain.

The most striking difference between the AncHuman and AncHominini isoforms is in the trans-repressive strength of PR-A on PR-B – the AncHominini PR-A can almost completely repress trans-activation by AncHominini PR-B, while the AncHuman PR-A's capacity to inhibit trans-activation by AncHuman PR-B is weakened compared to AncHominini PR-A. Thus, PR-B can still function as a trans-activator in the presence of stoichiometric ratios (1:1) of PR-A. These results are consistent with a previous study which compared the trans-activation and trans-repressive strengths of modern human and mouse PR-A and PR-B and found that the human PR-A was a weaker trans-repressor of PR-B than the mouse PR-A.

### Safety and immunogenicity of inactivated poliovirus vaccine schedules for the post-eradication era: a randomised open-label, multicentre, phase 3, non-inferiority trial [^11711U7s]. The Lancet Infectious Diseases (2021). Low credibility.

The primary objective of this study was to determine whether the immune response induced against poliovirus type 1 and type 2 — responsible for all cases of paralytic disease as wild polioviruses or circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses — 4 weeks after completion of the primary series were similar between infants receiving vaccine schedules that consisted of two or three doses of IPV, or two or three doses of f-IPV. This aimed to decrease the number of doses required to provide an adequate standard of immune protection in the community.

Three co-primary outcomes concerning poliovirus types 1 and 2 were explored:

- **Seroconversion rates at 40 weeks of age following a two-dose regimen of intradermally administered f-IPV**. This was assessed to see if it was non-inferior to a two-dose regimen of intramuscular IPV.

- **Seroconversion rates at 40 weeks of age following a two-dose IPV regimen**. The goal was to determine if it was non-inferior to a three-dose IPV regimen.

- **Seroconversion rates following a two-dose f-IPV regimen**. This was examined to ascertain if it was non-inferior to a three-dose f-IPV regimen.

Secondary outcomes included assessments of the superiority of seroconversion rates for poliovirus types 1 and 2 across the four regimens with different administration schedules, immunogenicity of different regimens in terms of neutralizing antibody titres, and safety measures. Exploratory outcomes encompassed the primary and secondary outcomes for poliovirus types 1 and 2, applied to poliovirus type 3.

### Pityriasis rosea-like eruption during treatment with imatinib mesylate: Description of 3 cases [^112LWdwM]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

Imatinib mesylate (IM) represents the first-line treatment for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). We hereby relate three cases of an IM-induced pityriasis rosea (PR)-like cutaneous eruption. Patients developed an erythematous, slightly pruritic, macular skin eruption, with many lesions having a peripheral collarette of desquamation. These were confined to the trunk, limbs, and arms, with a vaguely dermatomal diffusion. The histologic findings suggested a reactive process to the drug. Full dermatological recovery was obtained after IM discontinuation, but lesions reappeared upon resuming therapy, suggesting the drug-related nature of the rash. To our knowledge, this is the first reported PR-like cutaneous eruption associated with IM.

### Beyond the herald patch: Exploring the complex landscape of pityriasis rosea [^111e5nQG]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). High credibility.

Pityriasis rosea (PR) is a prevalent dermatological condition characterized by a distinctive herald patch, followed by secondary eruptions that often form a "Christmas tree" pattern on the trunk. Despite its recognizable clinical presentation, the etiology of PR remains uncertain, with hypotheses pointing to both infectious and noninfectious origins. Human herpesviruses (HHV) 6 and 7 have been implicated, with evidence suggesting viral reactivation as a potential trigger.

Epidemiologically, PR affects children, adolescents, and young adults, with a higher incidence in females. The condition is observed globally, with varying incidence rates and seasonal variations, suggesting an infectious component. While PR is generally benign and self-limiting, it can cause significant discomfort due to pruritus, and atypical presentations and recurrences complicate diagnosis and management.

This review evaluates the understanding of PR's pathogenesis, highlighting both infectious and noninfectious hypotheses, including viral reactivation and immune response mechanisms. It also examines treatment options, such as antivirals and phototherapy, which have shown varying degrees of effectiveness. Further research is needed to clarify etiological factors and to explore the efficacy and safety of various treatment modalities. Understanding these aspects is crucial for improving patient outcomes and developing targeted therapies, especially for atypical or recurrent cases.

Moreover, oropharyngeal lesions can occur in up to 28% of patients with pityriasis rosea (PR). These lesions are painless and are typically associated with the exanthem of PR. The most frequently observed patterns include petechial, macular, and papular lesions. While petechial enanthema has been predominantly associated with persistent PR and pediatric PR, macular and papular lesions are seen across various forms of the disease, including relapsing PR and classic PR. Thus, it is important to examine the oropharyngeal mucosa in patients with PR, as the presence of these lesions can help distinguish PR from other mucosal diseases and may indicate a more atypical course of the disease, such as persistent or relapsing forms.

Some patients may experience mild prodromal symptoms before the appearance of the herald patch, including a sore throat, gastrointestinal disturbances, fever, and arthralgia. Although the rash may be asymptomatic, some individuals may experience mild to moderate itching, which can worsen with heat or sweating. Severe itching occurs in about 25% of cases. Occasionally, patients may also experience gastrointestinal symptoms, joint pain, or slight enlargement of lymph nodes. The rash of pityriasis rosea typically resolves within 6 to 8 weeks in more than 80% of patients, though it may persist longer in some cases. It usually resolves spontaneously without leaving scars, and the herald patch may last longer than the secondary lesions. Figure 1 shows the classic presentation of pityriasis rosea on the chest, with oval erythematous patches distributed along ski

### The use of antivirals in severe or recalcitrant cases of pityriasis rosea: A case series [^116py2kS]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Low credibility.

The study has several limitations. Firstly, the series includes a limited number of cases. Additionally, as pityriasis rosea is often diagnosed clinically, these cases were not confirmed through biopsy. All patients in the study received concomitant topical steroids, and one case involved the use of doxycycline alongside antivirals, which may have affected the results. Lastly, since pityriasis rosea is a self-resolving condition, the natural progression of the disease may have contributed to the observed improvements in some patients.

### Afinitordisperz [^114mibo8]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Skin lesion response rates were assessed by local investigators for 77 patients in the AFINITOR arm and 37 patients in the placebo arm who presented with skin lesions at study entry. The skin lesion response rate was statistically significantly higher in the AFINITOR arm (26% vs. 0%) with a p-value of 0.0011; all skin lesion responses were partial responses, defined as visual improvement in 50% to 99% of all skin lesions, durable for at least 8 weeks (Physician's Global Assessment of Clinical Condition).

Patients randomized to placebo were permitted to receive AFINITOR at the time of angiomyolipoma progression or after the time of the primary analysis. After the primary analysis, patients treated with AFINITOR underwent additional follow-up CT or MRI scans to assess tumor status until discontinuation of treatment or completion of 4 years of follow-up after the last patient was randomized. A total of 112 patients (79 randomized to AFINITOR and 33 randomized to placebo) received at least one dose of AFINITOR. The median duration of AFINITOR treatment was 3.9 years (ranging from 0.5 months to 5.3 years), and the median duration of follow-up was 3.9 years (ranging from 0.9 months to 5.4 years). During the follow-up period after the primary analysis, 32 patients (in addition to the 33 patients identified at the time of the primary analysis) had an angiomyolipoma response based on independent central radiology review. Among the 65 responders out of 112 patients, the median time to angiomyolipoma response was 2.9 months (ranging from 2.6 to 33.8 months). Fourteen percent of the 112 patients treated with AFINITOR had angiomyolipoma.

### Pityriasis rosea and herpesviruses: facts and controversies [^115XGHmY]. Clinics in Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Pityriasis rosea is an acute exanthem with many clinical and epidemiologic features of an infectious disease. At the time of writing, human herpesvirus (HHV)-6 and HHV-7 appear to be the most indicted culprits, and the evidence in favor of this hypothesis and the controversial results produced elsewhere are discussed. The complex pathophysiology of HHV-6 and HHV-7 infection, their diffusion in the population at large, the difficulties of understanding whether the infection is still latent or is clinically manifest, as well as whether pityriasis rosea depends on a reinfection or on a viral reactivation, all make the issue extremely difficult to study and understand.

### Pityriasis rosea in otherwise asymptomatic confirmed COVID-19-positive patients: A report of 2 cases [^1172q2vE]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

To the editor: We enjoyed reading the case series on pernio-like eruptions in skin of color and appreciate the awareness the authors brought to this COVID-19–associated manifestation, previously largely documented in Fitzpatrick skin types I and II and darker skin types. Pityriasis rosea-like manifestations have been reported in COVID-19–positive patients, though similar published images largely show presentations in lighter skin types. Here, we present 2 cases of pityriasis rosea in Fitzpatrick types III and IV skin in otherwise asymptomatic COVID-19–positive patients. We hope that they contribute to an accurate diagnosis of COVID-19 manifestations in darker skin types.

### What's old is new: Valacyclovir for the treatment of pityriasis rosea, a retrospective case series [^1165X4UU]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Low credibility.

Pityriasis rosea (PR) is a common and self-limiting papulosquamous skin condition. It presents with the most distinguishable sign of a larger "herald" patch with a collarette of scale at the margins, followed by smaller, finer, bilateral erythematous scaly plaques. The lesions commonly occur over the trunk and extremities in a blaschkolinear "Christmas tree" distribution. PR is most encountered as a springtime eruption and typically affects children and adults (ages 10–35 years), with a peak in adolescence. The estimated prevalence of PR in the United States was found to be 0.3% to 3% at dermatologic centers and evenly distributed among both sexes as 0.13% in females and 0.14% in males.

Upon diagnosis of PR, patients may be informed that the condition is self-limiting, noncontagious, and unlikely to recur. A typical course develops and resolves on average within 6 to 8 weeks without therapy. However, the cutaneous eruption has been reported to last for 3 to 6 months. For some patients, the "watchful waiting" approach may not be sufficient due to symptomology and psychosocial distress associated with the appearance of lesions.

Symptomatic treatments for symptoms such as pruritus include topical corticosteroids, oral antihistamines, and anti-itch lotions. Alternative potential treatments include UV-B phototherapy, antivirals such as acyclovir, and macrolide antibiotics, with only modest success in clearing the eruption. Of the macrolides, a triple-blinded study on erythromycin 250 mg 4 times daily for 2 weeks resulted in remission after 2 weeks in 65% of patients.

### Epidemiologic, clinicopathologic, diagnostic, and management challenges of pityriasis rubra pilaris: A case series of 100 patients [^111S7AKg]. JAMA Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Pityriasis rubra pilaris (PRP) is a rare papulosquamous disorder with limited epidemiologic and clinicopathologic data. Little information is available on long-term outcomes, comorbidities, and treatment efficacy.

The objective of this study was to evaluate objective and subjective disease experience metrics from the perspectives of patients and clinicians. One hundred patients with a putative diagnosis of PRP participated by completing a comprehensive survey. This was followed by the acquisition of their medical records, including histopathology slides and reports. The data were analyzed separately from the health care clinician and the patient perspectives. Two academic dermatologists examined clinical notes, pathology reports, and photographs, confirming diagnoses via predetermined criteria. Patients were categorized into four levels of diagnostic certainty to allow stratification of the findings for subgroup analysis. Patients with a diagnosis of PRP were solicited through patient support organization websites.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Clinical outcomes, unexpected association of comorbidities, and efficacy (or lack thereof) of various treatment modalities.

Among the 100 patients, 50 were diagnosed as having classic, unquestionable PRP. The patients had a median age of 61 years (range, 5–87 years), and 46% were female. Fifty patients were categorized as level 1 diagnostic certainty, 15 as level 2, 30 as level 3, and 5 as level 4. Of the level 1 patients, 13 (26%) were correctly diagnosed at initial presentation; diagnosis was delayed.

### Pityriasis rosea-like drug reaction to asenapine [^111NWAUq]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Pityriasis rosea (PR) is a relatively common, benign skin disease of unknown etiology. In rare cases, medications can induce a morphologically similar eruption. We present a case of a PR-like drug eruption caused by the atypical antipsychotic asenapine. The clinical presentation consisted of a rapidly progressive, disseminated, and severely pruritic dermatitis comprised of ovoid, scaly, pink-violaceous plaques. The initial histopathologic specimen was consistent with PR, but upon re-sampling a week later, the findings favored a drug eruption. PR-like drug eruptions, though rare, can occur in response to a wide variety of medications. Because the findings may be only subtly different than those of typical PR, careful clinical and histopathological correlation must be sought. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of a PR-like drug eruption to asenapine.

### A case of pityriasis rosea concurrent with the novel influenza A (H1N1) infection [^114UauH2]. Pediatric Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Pityriasis rosea is a common skin disease with a self-limiting course. Multiple etiologies, including viruses, bacteria, and fungi, have been investigated in an attempt to confirm a causal association. While pityriasis rosea has not been associated with the influenza virus, it has been linked to herpes simplex virus types 6 and 7. We encountered a case of a proven pandemic H1N1 infection associated with a clinicopathological diagnosis of pityriasis rosea. We conclude that the influenza A (H1N1) virus could either be a primary cause of pityriasis rosea or a trigger for the reactivation of other viral causes.

### Pityriasis rosea: an update with a critical appraisal of its possible herpesviral etiology [^116niysA]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Pityriasis rosea is an acute, self-healing exanthem characterized by oval erythematous-squamous lesions of the trunk and limbs, usually sparing the face, scalp, palms, and soles. Constitutional symptoms with the character of true prodromes, clinical features resembling those of known exanthems, and numerous epidemiologic data all suggest an infectious origin. A variety of infectious agents have been implicated; however, human herpesvirus 6 and 7 have been extensively studied recently.

The goal of this review is to outline the epidemiologic, clinical, histologic, and ultrastructural features of pityriasis rosea while emphasizing its possible human herpesvirus nature. In addition, clues have been added to assist the reader in navigating the complexities of virologic investigation.

### Pityriasis rosea during omalizumab treatment for chronic spontaneous urticaria [^116tdKGY]. Dermatologic Therapy (2020). Low credibility.

Pityriasis rosea (PR) is an exanthematous disease whose etiology is related to the reactivation of human herpesviruses 6 (HHV-6) and 7 (HHV-7). We observed two cases of PR arising during omalizumab therapy for chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU). Here, we report for the first time PR occurring during omalizumab treatment. After PR diagnosis, viral serology was performed. Data in the literature about omalizumab's mechanism of action, PR, and HHV-6/7 infection were analyzed in order to identify possible correlations. In both our cases, IgM against HHV-6 and HHV-7 were negative. The first patient presented altered IgG titers for both viruses (1:160 and 1:80, respectively), while only HHV-6 IgG (1:320) were detected in the second patient. From data in the literature, we consider it presumable that apoptotic immune cells due to omalizumab immunomodulation could release viral proteins produced from integrated DNA. This could elicit cutaneous cross-reactivity and PR onset. In conclusion, we think there is a link between omalizumab therapy and PR occurring in patients with CSU. Our case history is too small to draw firm conclusions. Data collection of similar cases could be helpful to improve our knowledge.

### Line-field confocal optical coherence tomography assessment of pityriasis rosea [^117WmMzT]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

LC-OCT is a noninvasive, in vivo, high-resolution imaging technique that provides valuable information regarding the epidermal and superficial- to mid-dermal architecture. It captures vertical and horizontal two-dimensional images to create a three-dimensional image block. This technology has been employed to evaluate histopathologic features of skin cancer, pustular dermatoses, and certain eczematous conditions.

Although pityriasis rosea may clinically mimic other eczematous dermatoses, which often present as erythematous papules and plaques, rapid histopathologic visualization with LC-OCT can aid in accurate diagnosis. Key differentials that appear histologically as spongiotic dermatitis include psoriasis, contact dermatitis, and nummular eczema. The lack of visualization by LC-OCT of psoriasiform dermatitis, papillomatosis, and Munro microabscesses (usually visible in the epidermis as dark roundish areas with bright particles corresponding to neutrophils) renders the diagnosis of psoriasis less likely. In acute spongiotic processes, such as allergic or irritant contact dermatitis, the widening of intercellular spaces between the keratinocytes forms epidermal vesicles. Parakeratosis is usually present, and lymphocytic/leukocytic infiltration can also occur. The absence of vesicles makes an acute spongiotic process less likely. While spongiosis and parakeratosis are observed in nummular eczema, the presence of focal parakeratosis with hemorrhage supports the diagnosis of pityriasis rosea.

In summary, we found a good histopathologic correlation of LC-OCT visualization with key findings of focal parakeratosis, spongiosis, and erythematous conditions.

### Alopecia areata: Disease characteristics, clinical evaluation, and new perspectives on pathogenesis [^117XccQW]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Alopecia areata (AA) is a common, inflammatory, nonscarring type of hair loss. Significant variations in the clinical presentation of AA have been observed, ranging from small, well-circumscribed patches of hair loss to a complete absence of body and scalp hair. Patients affected by AA encompass all age groups, sexes, and ethnicities, and may experience frustration with the unpredictable nature of their disease, for which there is currently no definitive treatment. The cause of AA remains incompletely understood, though it is believed to result — at least in part — from a loss of immune privilege in the hair follicle, autoimmune-mediated hair follicle destruction, and the upregulation of inflammatory pathways. Patients with AA frequently experience marked impairment in psychological well-being and self-esteem and may be more likely to suffer from psychiatric comorbidities. Part one of this two-part continuing medical education series describes the epidemiology, clinical evaluation, prognosis, and recent advancements in the understanding of the pathogenesis of AA.

### Cutaneous plasmacytosis resembling pityriasis rosea in a 66-year-old white woman: A rare disease presenting in an unusual patient demographic [^111CwA8H]. JAAD Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

Primary cutaneous plasmacytosis is a disorder of unknown etiology characterized by reddish-brown papules and plaques primarily seen on the trunk and most commonly in middle-aged men of Japanese descent. The disorder was first described by Yashiro in 1976 and later termed cutaneous plasmacytosis by Kitamura et al. in 1980. Approximately 70 cases of cutaneous plasmacytosis have been reported in the literature, almost exclusively in the Asian population.

Cutaneous plasmacytosis follows a chronic and mostly indolent course with pathological features of dermal infiltrates with mature polyclonal plasma cells. Rare cases of systemic plasmacytosis with findings of lymphadenopathy, organomegaly, polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia, interstitial pneumonia, and interstitial nephritis have been reported. Close monitoring with serial surveillance is essential for patients with cutaneous plasmacytosis.

We describe a case of primary cutaneous plasmacytosis occurring in an unusual demographic, an older white woman.

### What's old is new: Valacyclovir for the treatment of pityriasis rosea, a retrospective case series [^112EzdgL]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Low credibility.

A retrospective chart review was conducted on nine patient cases from two clinical dermatology sites: one academic center and one private practice, both located in New Jersey. The patients were adults aged 22 to 72 years, evaluated between 2018 and 2022. Follow-up evaluations took place weeks to months after treatment, during which improvement in the appearance of the rash and symptoms were documented, along with any medication adverse events or intolerance. Clinical photographs were taken to monitor progress.

- **Response to treatment**: Characterized in three tiers:
	1. "None" was defined as a lack of response or persistence of lesions and symptoms after the full treatment course.
	2. "Significant improvement" was defined as improvement in the appearance and symptomatology of primary lesions but a lack of complete clearance.
	3. "Resolved" was defined as clearance of primary lesions with the absence of residual symptoms, accompanied by either the absence or presence of mild post-inflammatory secondary changes.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for spontaneous intracranial hypotension, particularly concerning the epidural blood patch, the SIH-SIG 2023 guidelines recommend offering a targeted patch to patients with a causative lesion identified on digital subtraction myelography or CT myelography. This is applicable for patients who remain symptomatic following appropriate conservative management and/or non-targeted epidural blood patches, provided the lesion is safely accessible via an image-guided transcutaneous approach.

### Pityriasis rosea-like cutaneous eruption as a possible dermatological manifestation after Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine: Case report and brief literature review [^113uk3Jj]. Dermatologic Therapy (2021). Low credibility.

Pityriasis rosea (PR) has manifested in patients suffering from COVID-19 as well as after vaccine protocols against SARS-CoV-2. It has a possible association with the HHV-6B virus (roseola infantum) and can be controlled by antivirals such as acyclovir, as well as by the amino acid l-Lysine, which showed a positive result in reducing the number of lesions and healing time. The aim of this study was to report a case of PR following a second dose of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, the adopted therapy, and a brief literature review.

A 53-year-old woman, phototype II, presented with an erythematous lesion in the posterior right thigh 15 days after the second dose of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. Eight days after the initial injury, new lesions appeared on the calf, buttocks, and thighs. The diagnosis was PR with a 5-week eruption cycle. The treatment consisted of the use of l-Lysine, 3 grams loading dose, and 500 mg for 30 days, along with moisturizing/healing lotion, starting 14 days after the herald patch. After the 5th week of the disease cycle, there were no new eruptions, and the repair cycle continued for up to 8 weeks, leaving some residual skin spots.

It is concluded that the patient may carry a latent virus, HHV-6, and the vaccine administration, with immune system stimulation, may have activated the virus causing PR. L-Lysine helped control the manifestation by limiting the number of lesions and their location, which were restricted to the legs, thighs, and buttocks.

### Pityriasis rosea-like drug eruption due to nortriptyline in a patient with vulvodynia [^111oHSBz]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2013). Low credibility.

Nortriptyline and other tricyclic antidepressants are widely used in the treatment of depression. They are also used in chronic pain syndromes such as vulvodynia. We report a case of pityriasis rosea (PR)-like eruption in a young woman who was treated with oral nortriptyline for vulvodynia.

- **Case report**: The patient presented with photosensitivity and erythematous, well-defined, oval papules and patches, with fine collarettes of scale on the dorsal hands, upper arms, and trunk. She showed a complete resolution of her rash with discontinuation of nortriptyline, thereby supporting the diagnosis of a drug-induced reaction.

- **Comment**: Pityriasis rosea-like drug eruptions have been associated with numerous medications, including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, antirheumatic drugs, lithium, and, more recently, biologics such as imatinib, adalimumab, and etanercept. A literature review did not reveal an association between PR-like drug eruptions and tricyclic antidepressants such as nortriptyline. We report a case of PR-like drug reaction to nortriptyline for clinical interest.
