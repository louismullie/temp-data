## Question

What are the clinical features that distinguish acute ischemic stroke from other stroke mimics?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to distinguish acute ischemic stroke from stroke mimics at the bedside and with imaging. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical foundation and the core principle of "time is brain". Then, I should verify the key historical discriminators that push probability toward stroke versus mimic. Next, I will examine the focused neurological examination and bedside scales. After that, I need to check the high-yield bedside tests that immediately change management. Then, I will review imaging strategy and how MRI and multimodal CT shift diagnostic certainty. I will also consider special populations, especially pediatrics, where the mimic spectrum differs. Finally, I should synthesize a pragmatic decision framework and address the safety of treating suspected mimics with thrombolysis when stroke cannot be excluded in the time window.

> Let me first confirm the clinical foundation: acute ischemic stroke typically presents with sudden-onset focal neurological deficits in a vascular distribution, and the principle of "time is brain" dictates that we treat first and refine the diagnosis in parallel rather than delay reperfusion while chasing mimics, because benefit from IV alteplase declines with every minute of delay [^111hxvYi] [^113k6uh4]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — up to roughly one-third of suspected strokes can be mimics, so I need to ensure a structured approach that balances speed with diagnostic safety [^117ThRpM] [^114a6dUg].

> I will now examine the historical discriminators that increase the likelihood of true stroke: an exact time of onset, abrupt maximal deficit, definite focal symptoms such as hemiparesis, hemisensory loss, aphasia, or hemianopia, and the ability to lateralize and subclassify the syndrome to an anterior versus posterior circulation pattern [^117ThRpM]. Wait, let me verify the counterpoints: cognitive impairment, abnormal findings in other organ systems, and non-neurologic complaints push toward mimics, and younger age with fewer vascular risk factors also lowers pretest probability of stroke, though exceptions exist [^117ThRpM] [^114a6dUg].

> Next, I should review the focused neurological examination and bedside scales. I need to ensure I document a clear vascular pattern: face, arm, and leg weakness or sensory loss, speech disturbance, visual field defect, ataxia, or cranial nerve deficits that map to a territorial syndrome, because this strengthens the case for stroke over mimic [^117ThRpM]. Let me consider validated tools: ROSIER performed well in the ED with sensitivity around 92–93% and specificity around 83–86%, and FAST trades some specificity for simplicity but remains widely used. Neither tool replaces imaging, but they structure pretest probability and communication [^113Cj5Ab] [^1161F9fr]. Hold on, I should verify limitations — pre-existing deficits and atypical presentations can degrade performance, so clinical judgment remains essential [^111SGNXB].

> I need to check the high-yield bedside tests that immediately change management. Hypoglycemia can perfectly mimic stroke and is rapidly reversible, so I should confirm blood glucose before any thrombolysis decision; hyperglycemia can also alter stroke phenotypes and worsen outcomes, so I must correct it promptly [^113TdqNd] [^111hxvYi]. Let me verify the next step: noncontrast head CT is the mandatory first-line imaging to exclude hemorrhage and some structural mimics, and it should not be delayed while awaiting labs unless there is a specific concern for coagulopathy; if CT is non-diagnostic and suspicion remains high, MRI with DWI is the most sensitive modality for early ischemia and for revealing mimics [^114y5TAU] [^116j43Eo] [^116mTVbM].

> Now, I will examine the imaging strategy in more detail. Noncontrast CT is fast and widely available and primarily rules out hemorrhage; early ischemic signs such as insular ribbon loss or hyperdense artery may be present but are subtle and reader-dependent, so a normal CT does not exclude ischemic stroke in the first hours [^116j43Eo]. MRI with DWI detects early cytotoxic edema and can identify small cortical, posterior fossa, or lacunar infarcts missed by CT; it also characterizes mimics like seizures, tumors, demyelination, PRES, or metabolic lesions through pattern recognition on DWI, FLAIR, GRE, and MRA, which is why MRI meaningfully reduces mimic rates when used early [^117SKuSd] [^114a6dUg]. But wait, what if MRI is not immediately available? Multimodal CT with CTA and CTP can increase specificity for mimics and help triage large-vessel occlusion, though sensitivity for early ischemia remains lower than MRI; still, high specificity helps avoid unnecessary thrombolysis or thrombectomy in nonischemic conditions [^111Xs1hv] [^114y5TAU].

> Let me consider special populations, especially children, where the mimic spectrum and discriminators differ. I should double-check that pediatric stroke pathways improve timeliness but still have limited diagnostic accuracy at the bedside, with seizures, migraine, and functional disorders dominating mimics. Adult tools like FAST and ROSIER have only modest sensitivity in children, so a low threshold for MRI is warranted [^116ofLJ3] [^1142AQg1]. In pediatrics, being well in the week before presentation, inability to walk, and focal face or arm weakness increase the odds of stroke, whereas seizures and loss of consciousness are not reliable discriminators as they are common in pediatric stroke, so I must avoid anchoring on those features [^115qMryw] [^116dXLoj].

> I should now synthesize a pragmatic decision framework. If the history and exam strongly suggest stroke with abrupt focal deficits in a vascular pattern, I should proceed with CT without delay, correct glucose, and initiate thrombolysis if there is no hemorrhage and the patient is within the window, because guideline-directed treatment should not be delayed to chase mimics when the pretest probability is high [^111hxvYi] [^113k6uh4]. If the presentation is atypical or the patient is young with low vascular risk, I should still obtain urgent CT, but I will prioritize MRI when feasible to clarify the diagnosis and avoid unnecessary reperfusion therapies; if MRI is unavailable, multimodal CT can help identify structural mimics or perfusion–imaging mismatches that redirect care [^114y5TAU] [^111Xs1hv]. Hold on, I should verify the safety point: in large registries, thrombolyzed mimics have very low rates of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage and better short-term outcomes than true strokes, supporting a treat-first approach when stroke cannot be excluded in the time window [^1155h4U6] [^113WiSk6].

> Finally, I need to ensure I address the safety of treating suspected mimics. Multiple cohorts show that among patients receiving IV alteplase, a small proportion ultimately have nonstroke diagnoses, and their complication rates, including sICH, are substantially lower than in true strokes. Guidelines accordingly advise not delaying thrombolysis to pursue additional testing when stroke is suspected and no contraindications are present [^1155h4U6] [^113WiSk6] [^113k6uh4]. Hmm, wait a minute — does this mean we should ignore red flags for mimics? No, it means we integrate pretest probability, correct reversible mimics like hypoglycemia, and use imaging efficiently, but we do not sacrifice time-sensitive benefit when the clinical picture is convincing for stroke [^113TdqNd] [^111hxvYi].

> In summary, I should confirm that the most reliable bedside discriminators remain abrupt onset, exact time, definite focal symptoms, lateralizable signs, and a coherent vascular syndrome, while seizures, confusion, nonfocal complaints, and multisystem abnormalities favor mimics. Imaging with noncontrast CT followed by MRI when needed provides the highest diagnostic yield, and in children I must adjust expectations because seizures and migraine are common and adult scales underperform, necessitating a lower threshold for MRI and stroke pathway activation [^117ThRpM] [^114y5TAU] [^116ofLJ3].

The key clinical features distinguishing acute ischemic stroke from mimics are **abrupt onset of focal deficits** (face, arm, speech, or visual field) [^117ThRpM] in a vascular distribution [^113FCq1L], with **lateralizing signs** and no loss of consciousness or seizures [^113Cj5Ab]. Mimics more often show **non-focal symptoms**, fluctuating or progressive deficits, seizures, syncope, or altered mental status [^1115zVsg], and may lack vascular risk factors [^113WiSk6]. Rapid **neuroimaging** (non-contrast CT or MRI) [^114y5TAU] is essential to confirm ischemia and exclude hemorrhage or other causes [^111fSNjf], and **glucose testing** is critical to rule out hypoglycemia [^113TdqNd]. These features, together with vascular risk factors and a clear time of onset, strongly support stroke over mimic [^117ThRpM].

---

## Clinical features favoring acute ischemic stroke

### Temporal profile

- **Abrupt onset**: Sudden, maximal at onset, often with a clear time stamp [^111iNyU1].
- **Vascular distribution**: Deficits map to anterior (MCA, ACA) or posterior (PCA, vertebrobasilar) territories [^113FCq1L].
- **Lateralizing signs**: Unilateral face/arm/leg weakness, hemianopia, aphasia, or neglect [^117ThRpM].

---

### Neurological examination

- **Focal deficits**: Objective, lateralizable findings (e.g. hemiparesis, aphasia, hemianopia) [^117ThRpM].
- **NIHSS correlation**: Higher NIHSS scores align with true stroke [^113WiSk6].
- **Absence of seizures/LOC**: No loss of consciousness or convulsions at onset [^115diE4z].

---

### Risk factors and medical history

Vascular risk factors — hypertension, diabetes, atrial fibrillation, smoking, and hyperlipidemia — increase the likelihood of stroke [^notfound]. A **prior stroke/TIA** history further raises suspicion [^111P9Yi8].

---

## Clinical features suggesting stroke mimics

### Temporal profile

Progressive or fluctuating deficits suggest mimics such as **migraine, metabolic derangements, or functional disorders** [^113FCq1L]. Atypical onset — gradual onset, non-lateralizing symptoms, or prominent non-neurologic features — also points away from stroke [^117ThRpM].

---

### Neurological examination

- **Non-focal deficits**: Generalized weakness, confusion, syncope, or diffuse sensory changes [^1115zVsg].
- **Seizures/LOC**: Loss of consciousness or convulsions favor seizures or syncope [^113Cj5Ab].
- **Functional signs**: Inconsistent, non-anatomic deficits suggest functional neurological disorder [^notfound].

---

### Medical history and demographics

Younger age, female sex, and fewer vascular risk factors increase the likelihood of mimics [^1155h4U6]. A history of **psychiatric illness** or functional disorders also supports a mimic diagnosis [^112mLRc2].

---

## Diagnostic tools and investigations

### Neuroimaging

Non-contrast CT is the **first-line test** to exclude hemorrhage and some mimics [^1136mP9y]. MRI with DWI is the **most sensitive modality** for early ischemia and for identifying mimics [^114Dn7LZ]. Multimodal CT (CTA/CTP) can help distinguish mimics from stroke in the acute setting [^111Xs1hv].

---

### Laboratory tests

Glucose testing is essential to exclude **hypoglycemia** [^113TdqNd], and basic labs (CBC, electrolytes, renal function) help identify metabolic mimics [^111iNyU1].

---

### Clinical scales

ROSIER and FAST are useful for initial triage but have limited specificity [^1161F9fr]. The **NIHSS** quantifies deficit severity and supports communication and triage [^116s8xcb].

---

## Distinguishing features

| **Feature** | **Favors stroke** | **Favors mimic** |
|-|-|-|
| Onset | Abrupt, maximal at onset | Progressive, fluctuating |
| Distribution | Focal, vascular territory | Non-focal, non-anatomic |
| Lateralization | Present | Absent |
| Seizures/LOC | Absent | Present |
| Risk factors | Vascular, prior stroke/TIA | Young, few risk factors |
| Imaging | Ischemia on CT/MRI | Normal or alternative diagnosis |

---

## Conclusion

The most reliable way to distinguish stroke from mimics is the **combination of abrupt onset, focal deficits in a vascular distribution, and confirmatory neuroimaging** [^113FCq1L]. Mimics more often show non-focal, progressive, or seizure-associated symptoms and lack vascular risk factors. Rapid imaging and glucose testing are essential to confirm ischemia and exclude hemorrhage or metabolic causes [^111fSNjf] [^113TdqNd].

### Current state of evidence for neuroimaging paradigms in management of acute ischemic stroke [^114y5TAU]. Annals of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Stroke is the chief differential diagnosis in patient presenting to the emergency room with abrupt onset focal neurological deficits. Neuroimaging, including non-contrast computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), vascular and perfusion imaging, is a cornerstone in the diagnosis and treatment decision-making. This review examines the current state of evidence behind the different imaging paradigms for acute ischemic stroke diagnosis and treatment, including current recommendations from the guidelines. Non-contrast CT brain, or in some centers MRI, can help differentiate ischemic stroke and intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), a pivotal juncture in stroke diagnosis and treatment algorithm, especially for early window thrombolytics. Advanced imaging such as MRI or perfusion imaging can also assist making a diagnosis of ischemic stroke versus mimics such as migraine, Todd's paresis, or functional disorders. Identification of medium-large vessel occlusions with CT or MR angiography triggers consideration of endovascular thrombectomy (EVT), with additional perfusion imaging help identify salvageable brain tissue in patients who are likely to benefit from reperfusion therapies, particularly in the ≥ 6h window. We also review recent advances in neuroimaging and ongoing trials in key therapeutic areas and their imaging selection criteria to inform the readers on potential future transitions into use of neuroimaging for stroke diagnosis and treatment decision making.

### Transient ischaemic attacks: mimics and chameleons [^113Enqr3]. Practical Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Specific challenges in diagnosing TIA

The main diagnostic challenge of TIA is that the symptoms and signs have usually resolved by the time of assessment. There is no test for TIA: the gold standard remains assessment as soon as possible by a clinical expert. The diagnosis relies heavily on the patient's account of their history and on expert interpretation of that history. Interobserver agreement for the diagnosis of TIA between different stroke-trained physicians and non-neurologists is poor. As in stroke, in some patients a collateral history may be essential.

### Can the FAST and ROSIER adult stroke recognition tools be applied to confirmed childhood arterial ischemic stroke? [^115diE4z]. BMC Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Paramedics and emergency physicians are usually the first health professionals to assess patients with possible stroke. Both play important roles in expediting triage and assessment of patients and facilitating appropriate diagnostic imaging. Pre-hospital tools are used by ambulance paramedics to recognise potential stroke. The Face Arm Speech test (FAST), has been shown to have high positive predictive value when used by paramedics (78%), primary care physicians (77%) and emergency physicians (71%) and is widely used in some countries including in Australia. It has a diagnostic sensitivity of 79% when used by paramedics. Our data suggests that the FAST has similar sensitivity to adults when applied to a group of children with confirmed childhood ischemic stroke.

Clinical diagnostic accuracy of ED physicians varies from 22–96%. Therefore clinical tools have been developed for adults presenting with brain attack symptoms to assist clinicians in distinguishing between stroke and non stroke mimics. The Recognition of Stroke in the Emergency Room (ROSIER) scale has been developed for use by emergency physicians. In order of discriminatory value acute onset of symptoms, arm weakness, leg weakness, speech disturbance or facial weakness predict stroke and seizures, confusion or loss of consciousness predict non stroke diagnosis. Sensory symptoms, vertigo, dizziness and HA are non discriminatory between stroke and mimic. ROSIER has a sensitivity of 91%, better than the prehospital tools such as FAST, CPSS and LAPSS and a specificity of 92%, similar to or better than the prehospital tools. The ROSIER had better sensitivity than the FAST in our pediatric patients with a positive result seen in 81% of cases but it is still less than adults.

### Stroke mimics and chameleons [^114a6dUg]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

A stroke mimic is a situation in which a diagnosis of stroke at admission is not confirmed, and a stroke chameleon is a situation in which a stroke is revealed by clinical symptoms that are not usual in stroke. The objective of this review is to identify the most frequent clinical situations in which stroke mimics and chameleons are encountered and consequences for the patient.

Recent Findings

The safety profile of intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) in patients who have stroke mimics is excellent, and intracranial hemorrhages are rare. Modern neuroimaging techniques help identifying most mimics. For stroke chameleons the role of imaging may be less important, especially when the clinical presentation is not suggestive of a brain disorder that request immediate neuroimaging. Education of health providers to identify such situations is crucial.

Summary

Stroke mimics account for up to 25% of admissions for probable strokes. The proportion of patients with stroke mimics decreases with use of MRI at baseline. Mimics cannot always be ruled out in emergency. The problem with mimics is that stroke facilities are not properly used, and patients may receive IVT. However, thrombolysis is usually well tolerated in mimics and we should not spend much time in all patients to improve diagnostic accuracy, knowing that the time lost is harmful in all patients, and will only prevent treating one mimic out of 100 patients. The problem with chameleons is more serious, because patients are not identified, and are not properly treated.

### Transient ischemic attack with infarction: a unique syndrome? [^115uf5iK]. Annals of Neurology (2005). Low credibility.

It is debated whether transient symptoms associated with infarction (TSI) are best considered a minor ischemic stroke, a subtype of transient ischemic attack (TIA), or a separate ischemic brain syndrome. We studied clinical and imaging features to establish similarities and differences among ischemic stroke, TIA without infarction, and TSI. Eighty-seven consecutive patients with TIA and 74 patients with ischemic stroke were studied. All underwent diffusion-weighted imaging on admission. Symptom duration and infarct volume were determined in each group. Thirty-six patients (41.3%) with TIA had acute infarct(s). Although TIA-related infarcts were smaller than those associated with ischemic stroke (mean, 0.7 vs 27.3 ml; p < 0.001), there was no lesion size threshold that distinguished ischemic stroke from TSI. In contrast, the symptom duration probability density curve was not broad, but instead peaked early with only a few patients having symptoms for longer than 200 minutes. The probability density function for symptom duration was similar between TIA with or without infarction. The in-hospital recurrent ischemic stroke and TIA rate was 19.4% in patients with TSI and 1.3% in those with ischemic stroke. TIA with infarction appears to have unique features separate from TIA without infarction and ischemic stroke. We propose identifying TSI as a separate clinical syndrome with distinct prognostic features.

### External validation of e-ASPECTS software for interpreting brain CT in stroke [^113RBQv8]. Annals of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study Design

We used data from 9 completed clinical trials or observational studies of patients with stroke in which CT had been assessed by panels of masked experts and a final diagnosis of stroke type determined.,

In a secondary analysis of these prospectively collected data, we processed the CTs using e‐ASPECTS to compare the expert scan assessments and final diagnoses with e‐ASPECTS results for the detection of acute ischemic features or ICH.

Following development of our research plan, we signed a software licensing agreement with Brainomix for use of e‐ASPECTS and paid for the software using academic funds. We agreed to separate testing into 2 types: (1) where software is used on the intended population, and (2) other clinical scenarios where software might be used. We thus used 2 overlapping populations:
"Target population": Patients with possible ischemic stroke but no alternative pathology on CT (ie, potential candidates for thrombolysis). Here, we included patients with a final diagnosis of ischemic stroke or stroke mimic without a CT‐identifiable cause, and compared ASPECTS provided by experts versus software.
"Representative population": To simulate hospital‐presenting patients with suspected stroke, we enriched our dataset to include realistic proportions of patients with a final diagnosis of ischemic stroke, ICH, and stroke mimics, and tested the diagnostic accuracy of software versus experts for identifying CT features that might account for stroke symptoms.

We report our results according to Transparent Reporting of a multivariable prediction model for Individual Prognosis Or Diagnosis (TRIPOD), but due to overlap of our research methods, we also consider other reporting standards, see Appendices S1–S3.

Patient Population

We analyzed CT brain scans performed soon after stroke onset from 7 national or international multicenter randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 2 single‐center prospective observational studies. These 9 studies recruited patients with acute stroke since May 2000: and one is ongoing. Six included ischemic stroke,2 were ICH, and one included all stroke or stroke mimics. Of the RCTs, 2 tested thrombolytics, one tested imaging strategies, one tested thrombectomy, one tested hypothermia, one tested blood pressure lowering, and one tested antithrombotic drugs after ICH; of the observational studies, one studied hemorrhagic, and the other studied ischemic stroke. We were unable to secure approval in time to include a tenth study as initially proposed.

All 9 included studies had research ethical approval and obtained informed consent for all participants.

### Distinguishing between stroke and mimic at the bedside: the brain attack study [^117ThRpM]. Stroke (2006). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

The bedside clinical assessment of the patient with suspected stroke has not been well studied. Improving clinical skills may accelerate patient progress through the emergency department. We aimed to determine the frequency and nature of stroke mimics and to identify the key clinical features that distinguish between stroke and mimic at the bedside.

Methods

Consecutive presentations to an urban teaching hospital with suspected stroke were recruited. A standard bedside clinical assessment was performed. The final diagnosis was determined by an expert panel, which had access to clinical features, brain imaging, and other tests. Univariate and multivariate analyses determined the bedside features that distinguished stroke from mimic.

Results

There were 350 presentations by 336 patients. The final diagnosis was stroke in 241 of 350 (69%) and mimic in 109 (31%). The mimics included 44 events labeled "possible stroke or TIA". Eight items independently predicted the diagnosis in patients presenting with brain attack: cognitive impairment and abnormal signs in other systems suggested a mimic, an exact time of onset, definite focal symptoms, abnormal vascular findings, presence of neurological signs, being able to lateralize the signs to the left or right side of the brain, and being able to determine a clinical stroke subclassification suggested a stroke.

Conclusions

The bedside clinical assessment can be streamlined substantially. This has important implications for teaching less experienced clinicians how to assess the patient with suspected stroke.

### Differentiating childhood stroke from mimics in the emergency department [^115qMryw]. Stroke (2016). Low credibility.

Results

The study population comprised 280 children with mimics, prospectively recruited from July 2009 until December 2010 and 102 children with stroke, prospectively and retrospectively identified from January 2003 until December 2010. No statistically significant difference between the 2 stroke cohorts was observed, with sex (P = 0.09) being the only variable approaching significance (Table I in the). AIS was the most common stroke subtype in 55 children, followed by HS subtype in 37 and TIAs in 10 children. Twelve children with stroke were excluded: 2 had cerebral sinovenous thrombosis, 5 were direct admissions to the inpatient unit, and 5 had incomplete medical records (Figure). In children with neurological symptoms or signs on arrival at the ED, the most common mimic diagnoses included migraine in 84 children, febrile or afebrile seizures in 46, Bell's palsy in 29, conversions disorders in 18, and syncope in 14 children. A full list of mimic diagnoses has been previously published.

Fourteen factors associated with increased odds, and 2 factors with decreased odds of stroke diagnosis (Tables 1 and 2), were included in the multivariable logistic regression model. Four factors emerged as being significantly associated with stroke diagnosis in the adjusted analysis. Being well in the week before presentation (OR 5.76, 95% CI 2.25–14.79) was associated with increased odds of stroke. Arm weakness (OR 8.66, 95% CI 2.50–30.02) was the neurological sign most strongly associated with stroke, but the association was poorly estimated as indicated by the wide 95% confidence intervals. Face weakness (OR 2.94, 95% CI 1.19–7.28) and inability to walk (OR 3.38, 95% CI 1.54–7.42) were also associated with increased odds of stroke. In contrast, the presence of other symptoms (OR 0.28, 95% CI 0.10–0.77) was negatively associated with stroke diagnosis (Table 3).

### Mimics of childhood stroke: characteristics of a prospective cohort [^112M2cCg]. Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Little is known about the clinical features and spectrum of diagnoses in children with "stroke mimics", those with acute neurologic deficits but without cerebrovascular diseases.

Objectives

Our goal was to describe patients with stroke mimics and to determine if clinical features predict benign diagnoses.

Methods

Our stroke consult team registered a prospective consecutive cohort of 143 patients with acute presentations suspicious for cerebrovascular disease from November 2003 to November 2004. Cases in which stroke was ruled out (stroke mimics) were reviewed for clinical features and diagnostic test results and were classified "benign" if there was no structural brain lesion and there was an expectation of complete recovery.

Results

Of the 143 cases evaluated for suspected stroke, 30 (21%) had stroke mimics. Presenting signs included seizure (n = 11), headache (n = 9), mental status change (n = 6), focal weakness (n = 14), and focal sensory change (n = 7). Eleven patients had "benign" diagnoses (3 migraine, 3 psychogenic diagnoses, 3 musculoskeletal abnormalities, 1 delirium, and 1 episodic vital sign changes). Nineteen patients had "not-benign" diagnoses (3 reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome, 3 neonatal seizures, 2 vascular anomalies, 2 inflammatory disease, 2 intracranial infection, 2 epilepsy, 2 metabolic stroke, 1 tumor, 1 drug toxicity, and 1 idiopathic intracranial hypertension). Except for the presence of seizures, there were no significant differences in presentation or risk factors between benign and not-benign cases.

Conclusions

Many disorders mimic childhood stroke. History and clinical presentation often do not distinguish the one third of patients with benign disorders from the two thirds with more serious problems, necessitating timely comprehensive investigations, especially brain MRI.

### Incidence and etiologies of stroke mimics after incident stroke or transient ischemic attack [^114nSFyd]. Stroke (2019). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose- Stroke mimics (SM) pose a common clinical challenge, but the burden of SM in patients with previous ischemic stroke (IS) or transient ischemic attack is unknown. The objective of this study was to calculate the incidence of SM in IS survivors, compare it with the incidence of recurrent stroke in the same population, and explore the time-dependent patterns of SM etiologies. Methods- This prospective cohort study registered SM events and etiologies among 1872 IS and transient ischemic attack survivors diagnosed with index stroke at Haukeland University Hospital stroke unit from 2007 to 2013 by review of medical records. Cumulative incidences of SM were estimated with a competing risks Cox model and compared with incidence of recurrent stroke in the same population. Results- During 8172 person-years of follow-up, 339 patients had 480 SM events. The cumulative incidence rate of SM during follow-up was 58.7 per 1.000 person-years (95% CI, 53.7–64.2) compared with 34.0 per 1.000 person-years (95% CI, 30.2–38.2) for recurrent stroke in the same time period. The risks of SM and recurrent stroke were highest the first year after index IS or transient ischemic attack. The most frequent SM diagnoses were sequelae of cerebral infarction (19.8%), medical observation, and evaluation for suspected cerebrovascular disease (15.6%) and infections (14.0%). The 2 most frequent and unspecific diagnoses (sequelae of cerebral infarction and medical observation) were clustered in the first months after index stroke. Conclusions- SM after IS or transient ischemic attack are more frequent than recurrent stroke and the risk is especially high in the early period. SMs are multietiological and unspecific diagnoses are most frequent early after index stroke.

### Chronic covert brain infarctions and white matter hyperintensities in patients with stroke, transient ischemic attack, and stroke mimic [^116fRsEJ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

METHODS

The data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request. Details on this cohort and ethics approval have been published previously; briefly, it was approved by an independent ethics committee, and requirement for informed consent was waived according to Swiss law. Overall, 81% of patients had MRI either on admission or during the acute hospitalization with details on the MRI methodology available elsewhere.

We included all consecutive hospitalized patients at our university stroke center (admission list) in a prospective registry collecting standardized, prespecified variables. For this analysis, we analyzed all patients with a final diagnosis of ischemic stroke, TIA, or stroke mimic admitted between January 1, 2015, and December 31, 2017. Ischemic stroke was defined according to the tissue‐based definition as imaging‐proven acute ischemia regardless of symptom duration or symptom duration of > 24 hours without imaging evidence of cerebral ischemia. TIA was defined as symptoms lasting < 24 hours without imaging‐proven cerebral ischemia. Patients were classified as a stroke mimic if they were admitted for stroke/TIA but discharge diagnosis was not as such. For differentiation of ischemic stroke and TIA, the updated definition incorporating imaging information was used. Patients with diagnoses potentially leading to brain lesions that could mimic CBI (Figure S1) were excluded. We also excluded patients who had only computed tomographic imaging until discharge (lower predictive likelihood of TIA and stroke mimics; Table S1).

### Acute stroke differential diagnosis: stroke mimics [^112mLRc2]. European Journal of Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Stroke mimics (SM) are non-vascular conditions that present with an acute neurological deficit simulating acute ischemic stroke and represent a significant percentage of all acute stroke hospital admissions. The most common clinical SM includes conversion/functional (psychiatric disorder); seizures and postictal paralysis; toxic-metabolic disturbances; brain tumours; infections, and migraine. Imaging is essential for SM recognition, being Diffusion weighted imaging (DWI), perfusion imaging and angiographic studies very useful. There are several disorders that may have imaging features that simulate acute ischemic stroke, mainly presenting with cytotoxic oedema and/or perfusion deficits. The imaging features of the most frequent clinical and imaging stroke mimics are reviewed.

### Differentiating childhood stroke from mimics in the emergency department [^112VCaS3]. Stroke (2016). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Clinical identification of stroke in the pediatric emergency department is critical for improving access to hyperacute therapies. We identified key clinical features associated with childhood stroke or transient ischemic attack compared with mimics.

Methods

Two hundred and eighty consecutive children presenting to the emergency department with mimics, prospectively recruited over 18 months from 2009 to 2010, were compared with 102 children with stroke or transient ischemic attack, prospectively/retrospectively recruited from 2003 to 2010.

Results

Cerebrovascular diagnoses included arterial ischemic stroke (55), hemorrhagic stroke (37), and transient ischemic attack (10). Mimic diagnoses included migraine (84), seizures (46), Bell's palsy (29), and conversion disorders (18). Being well in the week before presentation (odds ratio [OR] 5.76, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.25–14.79), face weakness (OR 2.94, 95% CI 1.19–7.28), arm weakness (OR 8.66, 95% CI, 2.50–30.02), and inability to walk (OR 3.38, 95% CI 1.54–7.42) were independently associated with increased odds of stroke diagnosis. Other symptoms were independently associated with decreased odds of stroke diagnosis (OR 0.28, 95% CI 0.10–0.77). Associations were not observed between seizures or loss of consciousness. Factors associated with stroke differed by arterial and hemorrhagic subtypes.

Conclusions

Being well in the week before presentation, inability to walk, face and arm weakness are associated with increased odds of stroke. The lack of positive or negative association between stroke and seizures or loss of consciousness is an important difference to adults. Pediatric stroke pathways and bedside tools need to factor in differences between children and adults and between stroke subtypes.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the evaluation of adult patients with suspected transient ischemic attack in the emergency department [^117WHGkN]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Evidence summary for initial imaging in suspected TIA — key findings and limitations: To summarize, "the evidence supports 3 key findings:" (1) "Although there is limited research quantifying the mimics identified on initial imaging in patients presenting with suspected TIA, it is likely that initial noncontrast brain imaging in the ED will identify some patients with serious alternative diagnoses. However, there is no evidence evaluating the safety of delaying neuroimaging in the ED". (2) "Initial noncontrast head CT findings do not reliably predict early stroke in patients presenting with suspected TIA". (3) "Both DWI and cervical vascular imaging predict short-term risk for stroke in patients presenting with suspected TIA". The literature "does not routinely examine whether early recognition of abnormal findings translates into improved outcomes", and "It is unclear whether immediate diagnosis of a serious TIA mimic on initial head CT in the ED… results in improved patient-centered outcomes".

### Transient ischaemic attacks: mimics and chameleons [^113wV2gw]. Practical Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Mimics

Up to 60% of patients referred to a TIA clinic do not have a final diagnosis of TIA, but this will depend on how patients are referred and the method of diagnosis. Any cause of transient neurological symptoms is a potential TIA mimic, giving a huge range of alternative diagnoses. Of 1532 consecutive patients attending our TIA service, 1148 (75%) had either definite or possible TIA, 46 (3%) had minor stroke and the remaining 338 (22%) had one of 25 alternative diagnoses (figure 1).

Figure 1
Frequency of transient ischaemic attack (TIA) mimics from 1532 consecutive suspected TIA referrals to the University College London comprehensive stroke service.

Frequent causes of transient neurological symptoms that can mimic TIA include:
Migraine aura
Seizure
Syncope
Functional or anxiety related

Table 1 shows some useful clinical distinguishing features for these common mimics.

### Hemorrhagic stroke [^116XokDX]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

When patients present to the emergency room with sudden onset of focal neurologic symptoms or altered consciousness, hemorrhagic stroke is a major focus of emergency diagnostic evaluation. The entities that compose hemorrhagic stroke, intracerebral and subarachnoid hemorrhage, are readily diagnosed with advanced imaging. This article reviews current imaging options for the detection of acute hemorrhage, along with the expected imaging findings for each modality. Common and unusual causes and their distinguishing imaging features are discussed. Imaging strategies and recent work in specific imaging findings that may guide patient management in the future are also addressed.

### Artificial intelligence and stroke imaging [^116UT5GE]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Phenotyping

The manifest clinical heterogeneity of stroke compels a reassessment of established assumptions regarding commonalities of pathophysiology and potential treatment targets. Approaches that help stratify the heterogeneity of traditional stroke subtypes will be key to achieving personalized treatment planning and improving our understanding of the mechanisms of the disease.

Recently, an approach to identify and evaluate new phenotypes of acute noncardioembolic ischaemic stroke based on 92 biomarkers in a multicentre dataset comprising 15 166 patients from 201 hospitals was proposed. The biomarkers were obtained from clinical, blood, and imaging data and a simplified model was obtained with the most relevant features. Gaussian mixture models were used to obtain clusters. They identified four distinct phenotypes with unique clinical characteristics, possibly unique disease pathophysiology, and significantly different clinical outcomes.

### Magnetic resonance imaging of arterial stroke mimics: a pictorial review [^116vBVEB]. Insights Into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Acute ischaemic stroke represents the most common cause of new sudden neurological deficit, but other diseases mimicking stroke happen in about one-third of the cases. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the best technique to identify those 'stroke mimics'. In this article, we propose a diagnostic approach of those stroke mimics on MRI according to an algorithm based on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), which can be abnormal or normal, followed by the results of other common additional MRI sequences, such as T2 with gradient recalled echo weighted imaging (T2-GRE) and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR). Analysis of the signal intensity of the parenchyma, the intracranial arteries and, overall, of the veins, is crucial on T2-GRE, while anatomic distribution of the parenchymal lesions is essential on FLAIR. Among stroke mimics with abnormal DWI, T2-GRE demonstrates obvious abnormalities in case of intracerebral haemorrhage or cerebral amyloid angiopathy, but this sequence also allows to propose alternative diagnoses when DWI is negative, such as in migraine aura or headaches with associated neurological deficits and lymphocytosis (HaNDL), in which cortical venous prominence is observed at the acute phase on T2-GRE. FLAIR is also of major interest when DWI is positive by better showing evocative distribution of cerebral lesions in case of seizure (involving the hippocampus, pulvinar and cortex), hypoglycaemia (bilateral lesions in the posterior limb of the internal capsules, corona radiata, striata or splenium of the corpus callosum) or in posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES). Other real stroke mimics such as mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, stroke-like episodes (MELAS), Susac's syndrome, brain tumour, demyelinating diseases and herpes simplex encephalitis are also included in our detailed and practical algorithm. KEY POINTS:
- About 30% of sudden neurological deficits are due to non-ischaemic causes.
- MRI is the best technique to identify stroke mimics.
- Our practical illustrated algorithm based on DWI helps to recognise stroke mimics.

### Imaging of acute stroke: current state [^115ow5UQ]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

This article reviews the current state of imaging for acute ischemic stroke. Protocolized imaging acquisition using computed tomography in conjunction with coordinated stroke care allows for rapid diagnosis and prompt revascularization. Following the initial evidence to support endovascular therapy for large-vessel occlusion, published between 2014 and 2015, there are now guidelines supporting treatment up to 24 hours after time of onset of symptoms. Neuroimaging remains a central component in diagnosing acute stroke and potentially excluding patients from stroke treatment, as outlined in this article.

### Accuracy of prediction instruments for diagnosing large vessel occlusion in individuals with suspected stroke: a systematic review for the 2018 guidelines for the early management of patients with acute ischemic stroke [^111LHdCQ]. Stroke (2018). Medium credibility.

Large vessel occlusion (LVO) prediction instruments in suspected stroke — systematic review findings — report that Medline, Embase, and Cochrane databases were searched on October 27, 2016, and thirty-six relevant studies were identified, with most studies (21 of 36) recruiting ischemic stroke patients, few prehospital studies (4 of 36), and some including hemorrhagic stroke or stroke mimics (12 of 36). The most frequently studied prediction instrument was the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, reported discrimination mostly ranged from 0.70 to 0.85 by the C statistic, and in meta-analysis sensitivity was as high as 87% and specificity as high as 90%, but no threshold on any instruments predicted LVO with both high sensitivity and specificity. With a positive LVO prediction test, the probability of LVO could be 50% to 60% (depending on the LVO prevalence in the population), but with a negative test the probability could still be ≥ 10%. Conclusions state that no scale predicted LVO with both high sensitivity and high specificity and that systems that use LVO prediction instruments for triage will miss some patients with LVO and milder stroke, and more prospective studies are needed to assess the accuracy of LVO prediction instruments in the prehospital setting in all patients with suspected stroke, including patients with hemorrhagic stroke and stroke mimics.

### Imaging and treatment of patients with acute stroke: an evidence-based review [^116kvAhk]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2014). Low credibility.

Evidence-based medicine has emerged as a valuable tool to guide clinical decision-making, by summarizing the best possible evidence for both diagnostic and treatment strategies. Imaging plays a critical role in the evaluation and treatment of patients with acute ischemic stroke, especially those who are being considered for thrombolytic or endovascular therapy. Time from stroke-symptom onset to treatment is a strong predictor of long-term functional outcome after stroke. Therefore, imaging and treatment decisions must occur rapidly in this setting, while minimizing unnecessary delays in treatment. The aim of this review was to summarize the best available evidence for the diagnostic and therapeutic management of patients with acute ischemic stroke.

### Stroke mimics in the acute setting: role of multimodal CT protocol [^111Xs1hv]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose

Ischemic stroke can be mimicked by nonischemic conditions. Due to emphasis on the rapid treatment of acute ischemic stroke, it is crucial to identify these conditions to avoid unnecessary therapies and potential complications. We investigated the performance of the multimodal CT protocol (unenhanced brain CT, CTA, and CTP) to discriminate stroke mimics from acute ischemic stroke.

Materials and Methods

We retrospectively selected multimodal CT studies performed for clinical suspicion of acute ischemic stroke in our center in a 24-month period, including patients with at least 1 follow-up imaging study (brain CT or MR imaging). Hemorrhagic strokes were excluded. We measured the performance of multimodal CT, comparing the original diagnostic results with the final clinical diagnosis at discharge.

Results

Among 401 patients, a stroke mimic condition was diagnosed in 89 (22%), including seizures (34.8%), migraine with aura attack (12.4%), conversion disorder (12.4%), infection (7.9%), brain tumor (7.9%), acute metabolic condition (6.7%), peripheral vertigo (5.6%), syncope (5.6%), transient global amnesia (3.4%), subdural hematoma (1.1%), cervical epidural hematoma (1.1%), and dural AVF (1.1%). Multimodal CT sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were 24.7%, 99.7%, and 83%. Multimodal CT revealed peri-ictal changes in 13/31 seizures and diagnosed 7/7 brain tumors, 1/1 dural AVF, and 1/1 subdural hematoma. CT perfusion played a pivotal diagnostic role.

Conclusions

Multimodal CT demonstrated low sensitivity but high specificity in the diagnosis of stroke mimics in the acute setting. The high specificity of multimodal CT allows ruling out stroke and thereby avoiding unnecessary revascularization treatment in patients with diagnosis of a stroke mimic.

### Management of stroke in neonates and children: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^116ofLJ3]. Stroke (2019). High credibility.

Pediatric AIS diagnostic timelines and stroke mimics in emergency care: The median time from symptom onset to parent seeking care ranges from 1.7 to 21 hours, with a majority usually presenting within 6 hours; median time to radiological confirmation is 15 to 24 hours, and delays are greater in evenings and weekends. In emergency departments, providers correctly diagnose stroke in ≈60% of children, giving ≈40% an initial stroke mimic diagnosis; the vast majority (60%–90%) of acute neurological presentations are non-stroke. Up to 40% of stroke mimics have serious or time-sensitive conditions, and adult diagnostic tools have limited utility in children, with a sensitivity of ≈60%.

Neuroimaging has expanded beyond its traditional diagnostic role and become a critical tool in the evaluation and management of stroke. The objectives of imaging include prompt accurate diagnosis, treatment triage, prognosis prediction, and secondary preventative precautions. While capitalizing on the latest treatment options and expanding upon the "time is brain" doctrine, the ultimate goal of imaging is to maximize the number of treated patients and improve the outcome of one the most costly and morbid disease. A broad overview of comprehensive multimodal stroke imaging is presented here to affirm its utilization.

IV alteplase pretreatment deliberation and timing — The potential risks should be discussed during thrombolysis eligibility deliberation and weighed against the anticipated benefits during decision making. It is reasonable that urgent IV alteplase treatment not be delayed while waiting for hematologic or coagulation testing if there is no reason to suspect an abnormal test. Treating clinicians should be aware that hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia may mimic acute stroke presentations and determine blood glucose levels before IV alteplase initiation. IV alteplase is not indicated for nonvascular conditions. Because time from onset of symptoms to treatment has such a powerful impact on outcomes, treatment with IV alteplase should not be delayed to monitor for further improvement.

### Clinical mimics: an emergency medicine-focused review of stroke mimics [^113FCq1L]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Stroke is a leading cause of death and disability and most commonly presents with focal neurologic deficit within a specific vascular distribution. Several other conditions may present in a similar manner.

Objectives

This review provides emergency providers with an understanding of stroke mimics, use of thrombolytics in these mimics, and keys to differentiate true stroke from mimic.

Discussion

Stroke has significant morbidity and mortality, and the American Heart Association emphasizes rapid recognition and aggressive treatment for patients with possible stroke-like symptoms, including thrombolytics. However, many conditions mimic the presentation of stroke, with up to a 31% rate of misdiagnosis, leading to potentially harmful treatment. Stroke mimics are conditions that present with stroke-like symptoms, including seizures, headaches, metabolic, infection, space-occupying lesion, neurodegenerative disorder, peripheral neuropathy, syncope, vascular disorder, and functional disorder. Factors of history and physical examination supporting stroke vs. mimic are discussed, though any sudden-onset, objective, focal neurologic deficit in a patient should be assumed acute stroke until proven otherwise. Head computed tomography noncontrast is the first-line imaging modality. Magnetic resonance imaging is the most sensitive and specific imaging modality. Neurology consultation is recommended in the majority of patients. If stroke is suspected after evaluation, shared decision-making for further management and consideration of thrombolytics is recommended.

Conclusions

Stroke mimics present a conundrum for emergency providers. A new focal neurologic deficit warrants rapid evaluation for stroke with neuroimaging and neurology consultation. Several mimics found on assessment may resolve with treatment.

### Magnetic resonance imaging of arterial stroke mimics: a pictorial review [^114Dn7LZ]. Insights Into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Differentiating a real ischaemic stroke from a stroke mimic a few hours after the onset of neurological symptoms can be a challenge for both neurologists and radiologists. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the best examination to demonstrate early signs of ischaemia, but also allows for the recognition of stroke mimics, thus optimising their adequate management.

The practical illustrated algorithm of the main 'stroke mimics' we propose here, based on the results of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and common additional magnetic resonance sequences, hopefully provides enough confidence to evoke such alternative diagnoses (Fig. 1).

### Serum GFAP for stroke diagnosis in regions with limited access to brain imaging (BE FAST India) [^111Zmuwb]. European Stroke Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

As a precaution, the potential treatment of patients with an intracranial bleeding and low GFAP levels (i.e. false negative findings) with antiplatelets might bear a risk of a greater hemorrhage. Based on available data, these risks might be manageable. Naturally, the GFAP test does not differentiate between ischemic stroke patients and stroke mimics. However, in acute stroke management, CT imaging is primarily used for excluding intracranial hemorrhage, and not for the positive identification of "true" ischemic stroke patients. The treatment of (few) stroke mimics patients with thrombolysis and antiplatelet agents is a broadly accepted condition, and studies did not reveal substantial risks of bleeding events in these patients.

This study has strengths. Firstly, it was conducted in a "true" low- to middle income setting in need of an alternative and cost-efficient testing method for acute stroke patients. This allowed determining the diagnostic accuracy in a stroke collective with a larger proportion of intracerebral hemorrhage cases than in Western populations. Secondly, ultra-sensitive SIMOA technology was used for biomarker detection. As a limitation, GFAP data in intracranial hemorrhage other than intracerebral hemorrhage is scarce, and the heterogeneous GFAP levels determined in this patient cohort (four patients) study does not allow a reliable conclusion. Furthermore, validation of the results is mandatory in larger multi-center cohorts.

To conclude, GFAP is a promising diagnostic marker for management of patients with acute stroke in resource-limited countries. A high diagnostic accuracy was shown in distinguishing intracranial hemorrhage from ischemic stroke and stroke mimicking conditions, especially in patients with high stroke severity. Further studies are needed to evaluate the clinical outcome following treatment initiation with aspirin in the patient group with low GFAP values as well as the cost effectiveness of the measure.

### Safety of thrombolysis in stroke mimics: results from a multicenter cohort study [^1155h4U6]. Stroke (2013). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Intravenous thrombolysis for acute ischemic stroke is beneficial within 4.5 hours of symptom onset, but the effect rapidly decreases over time, necessitating quick diagnostic in-hospital work-up. Initial time strain occasionally results in treatment of patients with an alternate diagnosis (stroke mimics). We investigated whether intravenous thrombolysis is safe in these patients.

Methods

In this multicenter observational cohort study containing 5581 consecutive patients treated with intravenous thrombolysis, we determined the frequency and the clinical characteristics of stroke mimics. For safety, we compared the symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (European Cooperative Acute Stroke Study II [ECASS-II] definition) rate of stroke mimics with ischemic strokes.

Results

One hundred stroke mimics were identified, resulting in a frequency of 1.8% (95% confidence interval, 1.5–2.2). Patients with a stroke mimic were younger, more often female, and had fewer risk factors except smoking and previous stroke or transient ischemic attack. The symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage rate in stroke mimics was 1.0% (95% confidence interval, 0.0–5.0) compared with 7.9% (95% confidence interval, 7.2–8.7) in ischemic strokes.

Conclusions

In experienced stroke centers, among patients treated with intravenous thrombolysis, only a few had a final diagnosis other than stroke. The complication rate in these stroke mimics was low.

### Comparison of CT and MR imaging in ischemic stroke [^116j43Eo]. Insights Into Imaging (2012). Low credibility.

Imaging

A number of clinical tests have been developed over the years to help determine the presence of stroke [e.g.]. Although these tests may aid in the initial triage of acute neurological patients, they cannot match the sensitivity and specificity of an imaging examination, nor is there any clinical test available that can accurately differentiate ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke. Therefore, the initial step in the management of a suspected stroke patient is an imaging examination. A non-contrast computed tomography (CT) examination, often employed at this stage, can quickly exclude the presence of hemorrhage. The absence of hemorrhage supports the diagnosis of an ischemic event, and some evidence of ischemia may be seen in the native CT as well. The hyperdense vessel sign and signs related to the loss of contrast between the gray and white matter (such as the insular ribbon sign and lentiform obscuration) are all examples of signs of acute ischemia on native CT (Fig. 1). The imaging examination also serves to exclude other pathologies that may resemble stroke clinically, known as the "stroke mimics". Such pathologies include, but are not limited to, spinal stroke, hemorrhagic neoplasms, encephalitis, multiple sclerosis, postictal (Todd's) paresis, some types of migraine, intoxications, hypertensive encephalopathy, hyper- or hypoglycemia, as well as psychiatric diseases (Fig. 2). Ischemic events, often of transitory duration, may also have their origin in arteriovenous malformations. A steal phenomenon may be responsible for the symptomatology in these cases although this concept is controversial (Fig. 3). Additionally, the distinction between ischemic stroke following arterial occlusion and ischemia following venous sinus occlusion with secondary hemorrhage is important. The treatment of venous occlusive disease is different from primary stroke, and the prognosis of the patient fully depends upon early diagnosis (Fig. 4). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is usually more sensitive and specific in distinguishing both the stroke mimics and secondary ischemic lesions. Finally, the application of a contrast agent may increase the specificity of imaging. Especially contrast-enhanced MRI can reveal a typical cortical pattern of ischemic enhancement and/or help to detect other pathologies that belong to the stroke mimics.

Stroke mimics and chameleons remain a major challenge to the clinician and clinical investigator. Misdiagnosis of stroke can result in significant harm to our patients, as well as unnecessary financial costs to the health care systems internationally.

The combination of these tools with clinical acumen can minimize diagnostic errors to the benefit of patients.

### Clinical scores for the identification of stroke and transient ischaemic attack in the emergency department: a cross-sectional study [^1161F9fr]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the sensitivity and specificity of bedside diagnostic stroke scales in patients with suspected stroke.

Design

A cross-sectional observational study of patients with suspected acute stroke in an emergency department in a UK hospital. DIAGNOSTIC SCALES: The results of an assessment with the Recognition of Stroke in the Emergency Room (ROSIER) scale, the Face Arm Speech Test (FAST) scale and the diagnosis of definite or probable stroke by an emergency department. Reference standard A consensus diagnosis of stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA) made after discussion by an expert panel (members included stroke physicians, neurologists and neuroradiologists), who had access to the clinical findings, imaging and subsequent clinical course, but were blinded to the results of the assessments by emergency-department staff.

Results

In 356 patients with complete data, the expert panel assigned a diagnosis of acute stroke or TIA in 246 and a diagnosis of mimic in 110. The ROSIER had a sensitivity of 83% (95% CI 78 to 87) and specificity of 44% (95% CI 34 to 53), and the FAST had a sensitivity of 81% (95% CI 76 to 86) and a specificity of 39% (95% CI 30 to 48). There was no detectable difference between the scales in sensitivity (p = 0.39) or specificity (p = 0.30).

Conclusions

The simpler FAST scale could replace the more complex ROSIER for the initial assessment of patients with suspected acute stroke in the emergency department.

### Hunting mimics and chameleons: diagnostic difficulties in atypical acute ischaemic stroke [^113mBGaF]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

The seemingly straightforward diagnosis of acute ischaemic stroke can be complicated by the presence of conditions presenting similarly to stroke, and atypical strokes presenting with confusing and non-classical signs. We present a diagnostic quest to disentangle the effects of a number of stroke mimics from those of an underlying bilateral cerebrovascular phenomena, where with appropriate treatment of the non-stroke conditions the patient was able to make a near complete neurological recovery.

### Epidemiology of functional stroke mimic patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111f6Zpt]. European Journal of Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Stroke mimics form a significant proportion of cases in acute stroke services and some present with functional neurological disorder. Little is known about the prevalence or clinical characteristics of functional stroke mimics (FSMs). A systematic literature search and meta-analysis were carried out on published studies reporting suspected stroke and stroke mimic rates; 114 papers met the inclusion criteria of which 70 provided an FSM rate. Random-effects models estimated prevalence rates across settings and moderators of FSM rate. Pooled proportions indicated that 25% [95% confidence intervals (CI), 22–27%] of suspected stroke cases were stroke mimics. Within the 67 studies providing positive FSM rates, FSMs represented 15% (95% CI, 13–18%) of stroke mimics and 2% (95% CI, 2–3%) of suspected strokes. FSMs were younger and more likely to be female, and presented more with weakness/numbness but less with reduced consciousness or language problems. Stratified analyses suggested higher stroke mimic rates in primary care versus acute settings (38% vs. 12%) but higher FSM rates in stroke units compared with primary care (24% vs. 12%). Functional rates were higher in studies that were descriptive, retrospective and in patients receiving thrombolysis. Several studies reported the proportion of functional stroke patients presenting to stroke services. FSMs have discernible demographic and clinical characteristics, but there is a conspicuous lack of evidence on their presentation or guidance for treatment. The social and psychological mechanisms underlying FSM presentations need more accurate quantification to help inform stroke pathways and improve care for these patients.

### Intravenous tissue plasminogen activator in stroke mimics [^113WiSk6]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The necessity for rapid evaluation and treatment of acute ischemic stroke with intravenous tPA (tissue-type plasminogen activator) may increase the risk of administrating tPA to patients presenting with noncerebrovascular conditions that closely resemble stroke (stroke mimics). However, there are limited data on thrombolysis safety in stroke mimics.

Methods and Results

Using data from the Get With The Guidelines-Stroke Registry, we identified 72582 patients with suspected ischemic stroke treated with tPA from 485 US hospitals between January 2010 and December 2017. We documented the use of tPA in stroke mimics, defined as patients who present with stroke-like symptoms, but after workup are determined not to have suffered from a stroke or transient ischemic attack, and compared characteristics and outcomes in stroke mimics versus those with ischemic stroke. Overall, 3.5% of tPA treatments were given to stroke mimics. Among them, 38.2% had a final nonstroke diagnoses of migraine, functional disorder, seizure, and electrolyte or metabolic imbalance. Compared with tPA-treated true ischemic strokes, tPA-treated mimics were younger (median 54 versus 71 years), had a less severe National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (median 6 versus 8), and a lower prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors, except for a higher prevalence of prior stroke/transient ischemic attack (31.3% versus 26.1%, all P < 0.001). The rate of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage was lower in stroke mimics (0.4%) as compared with 3.5% in ischemic strokes (adjusted odds ratio, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.17–0.50). In-hospital mortality rate was significantly lower in stroke mimics (0.8% versus 6.2%, adjusted odds ratio, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.20–0.49). Patients with stroke mimics were more likely to be discharged to home (83.8% versus 49.3%, adjusted odds ratio, 2.97; 95% CI, 2.59–3.42) and to ambulate independently at discharge (78.6% versus 50.6%, adjusted odds ratio, 1.86; 95% CI, 1.61–2.14).

Conclusions

In this large cohort of patients treated with tPA, relatively few patients who received tPA for presumed stroke were ultimately not diagnosed with a stroke or transient ischemic attack. The complication rates associated with tPA in stroke mimics were low. Despite the potential risk of administering tPA to stroke mimics, opportunity remains for continued improvement in the rapid and accurate diagnosis and treatment of ischemic stroke.

### The recognition of stroke in the emergency room (ROSIER) scale: development and validation of a stroke recognition instrument [^111SGNXB]. The Lancet: Neurology (2005). Medium credibility.

The clinical calculator "Recognition of Stroke in the Emergency Room scale (ROSIER scale)" for acute ischemic stroke, transient ischemic attack, carotid artery dissection and dizziness and vertigo.

The Recognition of Stroke in the Emergency Room (ROSIER) scale is a clinical calculator used in the emergency department setting to identify patients who are likely to have had a stroke. It is specifically designed for patients presenting with acute neurological symptoms. The ROSIER scale includes seven items: loss of consciousness or syncope, seizure activity, facial weakness, arm weakness, leg weakness, speech disturbance, and visual field defects.

The clinical utility of the ROSIER scale is to aid in the early recognition of stroke, allowing for prompt initiation of appropriate treatment and referral to specialist care if needed. It is particularly useful in distinguishing stroke from other conditions that can mimic its symptoms, such as seizures or migraines.

There are no specific exclusion criteria for the use of the ROSIER scale, but it should be noted that it is less reliable in patients with pre-existing neurological deficits or in those with non-stroke causes of acute neurological symptoms. It is also not designed to differentiate between ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke.

The ROSIER scale helps in the recognition of stroke in an emergency setting by evaluating several clinical symptoms and assigning them corresponding scores. This assessment involves a set of inputs based on observed conditions including loss of consciousness or syncope, seizure activity, asymmetric facial weakness, asymmetric arm weakness, asymmetric leg weakness, speech disturbance, and visual field defect.

Each of these inputs is binary (i.e., true/false) and corresponds to specific clinical features that may be present or absent in the patient. When performing the computation, each positive symptom (true) contributes 1 point toward the total score:

- Loss of consciousness or syncope = 1 point if true
- Seizure activity = 1 point if true
- Asymmetric facial weakness = 1 point if true
- Asymmetric arm weakness = 1 point if true
- Asymmetric leg weakness = 1 point if true
- Speech disturbance = 1 point if true
- Visual field defect = 1 point if true

The total score is the summation of points for all "true" responses. The score ranges from 0 to 7, where each additional point indicates a higher likelihood of a stroke occurring. Based on the total score, the following interpretations can be made:

- If the score is 0 or less, the interpretation is "Stroke is unlikely", implying that the combination of symptoms does not strongly suggest a stroke.
- If the score is greater than 0, the interpretation is "Stroke is likely", indicating that the observed symptoms align more closely with stroke indicators.

Secondary stroke prevention — brain imaging to distinguish stroke from mimics and to stratify prognosis. An accurate diagnosis of ischemic stroke or TIA is essential, and brain imaging reclassifies a substantial minority: about 15% to 25% of patients thought to have stroke receive an alternative diagnosis, and about 13% initially thought nonstroke are diagnosed with stroke. In patients with recent minor focal nonmotor, nonspeech deficits, diffusion-weighted MRI detected acute infarction in 13.5% and was associated with a > 6-fold increase in risk of recurrent stroke at 1 year.

### Transient ischaemic attacks: mimics and chameleons [^115M8TW2]. Practical Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Clinical features of TIA

The key rule here is that symptoms of TIA should mimic known stroke syndromes, and so depend on the arterial territory involved. Distinguishing the territory is important to guide further investigation and secondary prevention. Some common patterns of presentation (eg, hemiparesis) are not very helpful in distinguishing the arterial territory, as they can occur with both anterior and posterior circulation TIAs. Others can be more localising: for example, aphasia or transient monocular visual loss suggest carotid territory ischaemia, while bilateral limb weakness, vertigo, hearing loss, haemianopia or diplopia are features of vertebrobasilar (brainstem) ischaemia. TIAs due to perforating artery disease should mimic a known lacunar syndrome (most often hemisensory or hemimotor symptoms affecting the face, arm and leg); moreover, such 'lacunar' TIAs may be recurrent and stereotyped over a short period (days) as in the "capsular warning syndrome". Increased awareness of symptoms means that patients can now present with very restricted transient syndromes, including isolated vertigo, dysarthria or hemisensory disturbance: in such cases, clinicians should consider other causes before diagnosing TIA.

Abrupt onset of maximal symptoms predicts a final diagnosis of TIA, but there is no evidence for a statistical difference between duration of symptoms in patients with TIA and mimics. These findings may of course be rather circular, since sudden symptoms are part of the usual criteria for diagnosis of TIA, and part of what makes a mimic is its similar time course to TIA. Nevertheless, other key aspects of the history that are useful to help identify TIA from mimics are as follows:
Age and other demographic data: is there a high a priori probability of a cerebrovascular event?
Nature of the symptoms: 'positive' versus 'negative'?
Onset and progression
Duration
Precipitating factors
Associated symptoms, for example, headache, loss of awareness, during or after the attacks

Age and other demographic data

TIAs are rare in young people without vascular risk factors (eg, hypertension, ischaemic heart disease, diabetes mellitus, smoking, haematological disease, etc). In otherwise healthy pregnant women, transient neurological symptoms are a common reason for neurological referral, but are often related to migraine. Seizures and syncope occur at all ages, although the underlying causes may differ. Syncope is more common in women, but seizures have no sex predilection. TIAs are more common in men at younger ages, but the sex difference reduces after the menopause.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the evaluation of adult patients with suspected transient ischemic attack in the emergency department [^1124knDd]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Future research priorities for imaging in suspected transient ischemic attack (TIA) in the emergency department (ED) emphasize practical testing and patient-centered outcomes, noting that much of the literature does not use identification of TIA mimics or prediction of early (ie, 2- or 7-day) stroke as the primary outcome. Proposed areas include quantifying the ability of noncontrast head CT and noncontrast brain MRI to detect clinically important TIA mimics at ED presentation, evaluating the safety of delaying neuroimaging from the initial ED workup including discharge for an outpatient workup, integrating a risk score and imaging strategy to identify TIA patients at high short-term risk for stroke to improve ED risk stratification, and identifying acute interventions for TIA that improve functional outcomes, quality of life, and other patient-centered outcomes.

### Stroke mimics and intravenous thrombolysis [^117YLWPM]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Study Objective

The necessity for rapid administration of intravenous thrombolysis in patients with acute ischemic stroke may lead to treatment of patients with conditions mimicking stroke. We analyze stroke patients treated with intravenous thrombolysis in our center to characterize cases classified as stroke mimics.

Methods

We identified and reviewed all cases with a diagnosis other than ischemic stroke in our large-scale single-center stroke thrombolysis registry. We compared these stroke mimics with patients with neuroimaging-negative and neuroimaging-positive ischemic stroke results.

Results

Among 985 consecutive intravenous thrombolysis-treated patients, we found 14 stroke mimics (1.4%; 95% confidence interval 0.8% to 2.4%), 694 (70.5%) patients with neuroimaging-positive ischemic stroke results, and 275 (27.9%) patients with neuroimaging-negative ischemic stroke results. Stroke mimics were younger than patients with neuroimaging-negative or -positive ischemic stroke results. Compared with patients with neuroimaging-positive ischemic stroke results, stroke mimics had less severe symptoms at baseline and better 3-month outcome. No differences appeared in medical history or clinical features between stroke mimics and patients with neuroimaging-negative ischemic stroke results. None of the stroke mimics developed symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage compared with 63 (9.1%) among patients with neuroimaging-positive ischemic stroke results and 6 (2.2%) among patients with neuroimaging-negative ischemic stroke results.

Conclusion

Stroke mimics were infrequent among intravenous thrombolysis-treated stroke patients in this cohort, and their treatment did not lead to harmful complications.

### Diffusion-weighted imaging and diagnosis of transient ischemic attack [^111jVvsF]. Annals of Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

We found no evidence that the DWI-positive rate varied with time between TIA and scanning (see Fig 3), either on summary analysis of several time parameters or in individual studies' reports (see Supplementary Table 2). DWI lesions may disappear very rapidly, for example, being present at 4 hours after symptom onset but resolving completely from DWI and other MR sequences by 24 hours, or not being visible on hyperacute imaging but becoming visible at 24 to 48 hours, indicating some instability of DWI. Eleven studies reported no association between symptom duration and DWI positivity, and 11 other studies reported a positive association; this 50:50 split suggests that symptom duration is a less consistent factor than might be expected. The 7-fold variation in DWI-positive rate was not explained by prospective or retrospective study design (see Fig 4), specialist versus nonspecialist doctors/services (Fig 5), inclusion of minor stroke and TIA versus TIA alone, older versus recent publication (heterogeneity was worse in recent publications; see Supplementary Fig 3), study setting (see Supplementary Fig 4), or inclusion of mimics (mimics were excluded).

### Imaging of suspected stroke in children, from theSpecial series on emergency radiology [^1157ehT7]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2023). Medium credibility.

Pediatric stroke encompasses different causes, clinical presentations, and associated conditions across ages. Although it is relatively uncommon, pediatric stroke presents with poor short- and long-term outcomes in many cases. Because of a wide range of overlapping presenting symptoms between pediatric stroke and other more common conditions, such as migraine and seizures, stroke diagnosis can be challenging or delayed in children. When combined with a comprehensive medical history and physical examination, neuroimaging plays a crucial role in diagnosing stroke and differentiating stroke mimics. This review highlights the current neuroimaging workup for diagnosing pediatric stroke in the emergency department, describes advantages and disadvantages of different imaging modalities, highlights disorders that predispose children to infarct or hemorrhage, and presents an overview of stroke mimics. Key differences in the initial approach to suspected stroke between children and adults are also discussed.

### Atypical presentations of acute cerebrovascular syndromes [^112DorRx]. The Lancet: Neurology (2011). Medium credibility.

Correct diagnosis of acute stroke is of paramount importance to clinicians to enable selection of correct treatments and to ensure prevention of acute complications, including recurrent stroke. Timely diagnosis can be difficult in some cases because patients with acute stroke can present with atypical or uncommon symptoms that suggest another cause altogether. Publications on these patients suggest that the following strategies could help to reduce misdiagnosis. First, clinicians should suspect stroke in any patient with abrupt onset of neurological symptoms. Second, clinicians should be aware that some patients will initially present with various uncommon and atypical stroke symptoms. Third, a complete and systematic neurological examination should be routinely done in patients presenting with acute neurological symptoms because this might shed light on the true nature of the problem. Finally, clinicians should be aware that even with the most sophisticated neuroimaging tests, stroke might be missed in the early hours after the event.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® cerebrovascular disease-child [^1142AQg1]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Stroke is an uncommon but an important and under-recognized cause of morbidity and mortality in children. Strokes may be due to either brain ischemia or intracranial hemorrhage. Common symptoms of pediatric acute stroke include headache, vomiting, focal weakness, numbness, visual disturbance, seizures, and altered consciousness. Most children presenting with an acute neurologic deficit do not have an acute stroke, but have symptoms due to stroke mimics which include complicated migraine, seizures with postictal paralysis, and Bell palsy. Because of frequency of stroke mimics, in children and the common lack of specificity in symptoms, the diagnosis of a true stroke may be delayed. There are a relatively large number of potential causes of stroke mimic and true stroke. Consequently, imaging plays a critical role in the assessment of children with possible stroke and especially in children who present with acute onset of stroke symptoms. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Diffusion-weighted imaging and diagnosis of transient ischemic attack [^117HrnY5]. Annals of Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

The work has strengths. We included 3× more patients (9,000 vs 2,500) and 80% more studies than previous reviews, including 35 studies published within their time period. We used rigorous methods and multiple overlapping searches; several authors double-checked the data. We assessed the most clinically relevant sources of heterogeneity for which there were data (having 47 studies allows 4 factors to be examined reliably;). There are also weaknesses. Analysis of original data in an individual patient data meta-analysis might be more informative but would be limited by the primary data quality. We were not able to assess the impact of the proportion of TIA patients in each study who did not have DWI, as this information was largely missing; most studies reported only on patients who did have DWI and the findings. Not all patients can have MRI anyway, due to claustrophobia or contraindications. If variation in the proportion scanned were a major source of variation in DWI positive rate, then we might have seen more difference between retrospective and prospective, or between expert-assessed and non–expert-assessed patients, but this was not the case. We did not perform complete duplicate assessments but used multiple cross checks between reviewers to ensure validity. That we found more data in the time frame than 2 previous reviews suggests that our methods were sensitive. We provide study quality markers in Supplementary Tables 1 and 2; these were used to assess heterogeneity, there being no valid tool for assessment of nonrandomized studies.

What are the implications? There were no data for calculating sensitivity or specificity of DWI in TIA/minor stroke, all patients with mimics or hemorrhage being excluded, although TIA mimics make up about 45% of clinic referrals, and occasional small intracerebral hemorrhages can present with TIA. The proportion of TIA patients without a visible ischemic lesion on DWI (65.7%) would be even higher if the denominator were all patients attending the clinic including the mimics rather than only those with a definite TIA. Assuming that the 45% of patients attending stroke prevention clinics with a final diagnosis of mimic did not have a DWI-visible lesion (which would be incorrect, as some with migraine, postictal states, hypoglycemia, multiple sclerosis, etc might have DWI-positive lesions) would result in much larger proportions of DWI-negative scans. As an approximation, DWI would be positive in 19% of unselected patients referred with suspected TIA, leaving a large proportion (81%) of negative, noncontributory scans.

### Magnetic resonance imaging of arterial stroke mimics: a pictorial review [^111AXbYD]. Insights Into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Abstract

Acute ischaemic stroke represents the most common cause of new sudden neurological deficit, but other diseases mimicking stroke happen in about one-third of the cases. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the best technique to identify those 'stroke mimics'. In this article, we propose a diagnostic approach of those stroke mimics on MRI according to an algorithm based on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), which can be abnormal or normal, followed by the results of other common additional MRI sequences, such as T2 with gradient recalled echo weighted imaging (T2-GRE) and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR). Analysis of the signal intensity of the parenchyma, the intracranial arteries and, overall, of the veins, is crucial on T2-GRE, while anatomic distribution of the parenchymal lesions is essential on FLAIR. Among stroke mimics with abnormal DWI, T2-GRE demonstrates obvious abnormalities in case of intracerebral haemorrhage or cerebral amyloid angiopathy, but this sequence also allows to propose alternative diagnoses when DWI is negative, such as in migraine aura or headaches with associated neurological deficits and lymphocytosis (HaNDL), in which cortical venous prominence is observed at the acute phase on T2-GRE. FLAIR is also of major interest when DWI is positive by better showing evocative distribution of cerebral lesions in case of seizure (involving the hippocampus, pulvinar and cortex), hypoglycaemia (bilateral lesions in the posterior limb of the internal capsules, corona radiata, striata or splenium of the corpus callosum) or in posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES). Other real stroke mimics such as mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, stroke-like episodes (MELAS), Susac's syndrome, brain tumour, demyelinating diseases and herpes simplex encephalitis are also included in our detailed and practical algorithm.

Key points

- About 30% of sudden neurological deficits are due to non-ischaemic causes.

- MRI is the best technique to identify stroke mimics.

- Our practical illustrated algorithm based on DWI helps to recognise stroke mimics.

### Uncommon causes of ischaemic stroke: how to approach the diagnosis [^115aqhh1]. Practical Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Stroke is a common neurological emergency and although most cases are associated with traditional vascular risk factors leading to cerebral ischaemia by well-recognised pathophysiological mechanisms, around 4% of ischaemic strokes are due to rare conditions. These are important to recognise due to their different management, which is often specific and effective, and due to their different prognosis from otherwise cryptogenic ischaemic strokes. We outline a practical approach to identifying uncommon causes of ischaemic stroke by highlighting diagnostic 'red flags' and propose a structured approach to investigating them.

### Transient ischemic attack overview: defining the challenges for improving outcomes [^111P9Yi8]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Transient ischemic attacks are reversible neurologic events that herald potentially catastrophic strokes. Well designed studies have documented that approximately 10% of patients who have a transient ischemic attack will have a stroke within the succeeding 90 days; half of these strokes occur within 48 hours of the transient ischemic attack. Improved outcomes from transient ischemic attacks require a heightened awareness of the clinical features of transient ischemic attacks on the part of both patients and physicians. The significant potential for stroke in the immediate days after the transient ischemic attack imposes an urgency in the diagnostic evaluation of these patients. A review of the literature suggests that there is a need for pathways to promote facilitated evaluations of transient ischemic attack patients in order to identify underlying correctable pathologies, and to direct medical and surgical management strategies.

### Chronic covert brain infarctions and white matter hyperintensities in patients with stroke, transient ischemic attack, and stroke mimic [^115k9Y1M]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

A total of 2112 patients were included in the study, of which 43% were female. The median age was 71 years [Q1–Q3, 59–80]; the median score on the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale was 2 points [1–7]. Patient characteristic and imaging biomarkers according to the neurological event are shown in Table 1 and Table S2. Patients with a final diagnosis of stroke mimic were significantly younger than patients with an acute ischemic stroke/TIA and showed a lower cardiovascular risk profile.

Table 1
Basic Information and Neuroimaging Biomarkers of Patients According to Final Diagnosis

Chronic CBIs were more frequently found in patients with ischemic stroke (38%; 95% CI, 36%–41%) and patients with TIA (28%; 95% CI, 23%–32%) compared with patients who suffered from stroke mimics (10%; 95% CI, 3%–23%). None of the patients with stroke mimic had multiple CBIs, although only 4 patients had any CBIs, but the proportion of patients with stroke mimic with multiple CBIs was not significantly different from that in the other 2 groups. WMH score was lower in patients with stroke mimic, but there was no significant difference between patients with TIA and patients with ischemic stroke (P = 0.093, Table 1). On linear regression, the presence of any CBI (β, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.38–1.01) and WMH (β per point on age‐related white matter changes scale, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.27–0.58) was associated with ABCD2 scores in patients with TIA. The accuracy of prediction was good for high‐risk TIA (cross‐validated area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [cvAUC] 0.89; 95% CI, 0.79–0.93) and fair for low‐risk TIA (cvAUC, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.59–0.77) on the basis of brain imaging and basic clinical information (age and sex) alone. The discrimination for the prediction of stroke mimic between models incorporating only age and sex in addition to imaging biomarkers as compared with more sophisticated models incorporating clinical information was not statistically significant (P = 0.18; Figure S3).

### Etiologic workup in cases of cryptogenic stroke: a systematic review of international clinical practice guidelines [^112FtqSN]. Stroke (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Current CPGs on the etiologic workup of acute ischemic stroke are of variable quality but largely reach consensus about appropriate standard investigations. There is, however, little agreement and a lack of underpinning evidence for more advanced or specialized investigations for rarer causes of stroke. This lack of evidence and consensus, along with poor applicability of many of the existing guidelines, is likely to contribute to variability of access to investigations, inappropriate use of costly and specialized resources and skills, along with delays or lack of diagnosis of etiologies. Unless addressed, this gap in knowledge will continue to result in missed opportunities to identify and implement necessary secondary prevention measures and provide high-quality clinical and psychological advice and support to stroke survivors and their families in relation to ongoing stroke risk.

### Why identification of stroke syndromes is still important [^112ibZKq]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Recent trends in the practice of stroke neurology lay a strong and excessive reliance on data generated from large epidemiological and clinical trials to direct patient care. This article highlights some of the pitfalls of this approach. It discusses the continuing importance of identifying stroke syndromes in implementing individualized patient care.

Recent Findings

Stroke is a heterogeneous disease and occurs through a variety of mechanisms. With the help of examples, the article illustrates some of the complexities of clinical decision making in an individual patient. Some important recent advances in the diagnostic and treatment armamentarium for stroke are also discussed.

Summary

Identification of stroke syndromes remains an important tool in the rational management of stroke patients.

### Discriminative capacity of biomarkers for acute stroke in the emergency department [^1164e8L3]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Acute ischemic stroke remains largely a clinical diagnosis.

Objective

To assess the potential of several biomarkers to distinguish acute ischemic stroke from mimics in the emergency department (ED).

Methods

In this prospective study, 63 patients with suspected acute stroke were enrolled. Blood samples were collected at ED presentation and assayed for B-type natriuretic peptide, C-reactive protein (CRP), matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9), D-dimer, and protein S100B. Final diagnosis of stroke was rendered by blinded independent stroke experts after review of all clinical, imaging, and conventional laboratory data during admission. Logistic regression and bootstrapping models were used to evaluate the association between biomarker values and acute stroke.

Results

Thirty-four patients had a final diagnosis of stroke and 29 with mimics. The initial ED values of CRP, MMP-9, and S100B (C-indices of 0.808, 0.811, and 0.719, respectively) and the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) (C-index 0.887) predicted acute cerebral ischemia. CRP levels added discriminative value over clinical variables alone in the diagnosis of stroke. When the levels of CRP were added to the NIHSS, the combination was highly predictive of stroke (bootstrap mean C-index 0.951, 90% Confidence Interval 0.903–0.991, likelihood test p = 0.004).

Conclusions

Biomarker testing with CRP and potentially MMP-9 and S100B, may add valuable and time-sensitive diagnostic information in the early evaluation of patients with suspected stroke in the ED. Future prospective evaluations are necessary to validate the diagnostic capability of these biomarkers for acute ischemic stroke in the ED before they should be considered for use in clinical practice.

### StrokeClassifier: ischemic stroke etiology classification by ensemble consensus modeling using electronic health records [^1156raNg]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Determining acute ischemic stroke (AIS) etiology is fundamental to secondary stroke prevention efforts but can be diagnostically challenging. We trained and validated an automated classification tool, StrokeClassifier, using electronic health record (EHR) text from 2039 non-cryptogenic AIS patients at 2 academic hospitals to predict the 4-level outcome of stroke etiology adjudicated by agreement of at least 2 board-certified vascular neurologists' review of the EHR. StrokeClassifier is an ensemble consensus meta-model of 9 machine learning classifiers applied to features extracted from discharge summary texts by natural language processing. StrokeClassifier was externally validated in 406 discharge summaries from the MIMIC-III dataset reviewed by a vascular neurologist to ascertain stroke etiology. Compared with vascular neurologists' diagnoses, StrokeClassifier achieved the mean cross-validated accuracy of 0.74 and weighted F1 of 0.74 for multi-class classification. In MIMIC-III, its accuracy and weighted F1 were 0.70 and 0.71, respectively. In binary classification, the two metrics ranged from 0.77 to 0.96. The top 5 features contributing to stroke etiology prediction were atrial fibrillation, age, middle cerebral artery occlusion, internal carotid artery occlusion, and frontal stroke location. We designed a certainty heuristic to grade the confidence of StrokeClassifier's diagnosis as non-cryptogenic by the degree of consensus among the 9 classifiers and applied it to 788 cryptogenic patients, reducing cryptogenic diagnoses from 25.2% to 7.2%. StrokeClassifier is a validated artificial intelligence tool that rivals the performance of vascular neurologists in classifying ischemic stroke etiology. With further training, StrokeClassifier may have downstream applications including its use as a clinical decision support system.

### Transient ischaemic attacks: mimics and chameleons [^1124uhCk]. Practical Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Suspected transient ischaemic attack (TIA) is a common diagnostic challenge for physicians in neurology, stroke, general medicine and primary care. It is essential to identify TIAs promptly because of the very high early risk of ischaemic stroke, requiring urgent investigation and preventive treatment. On the other hand, it is also important to identify TIA 'mimics', to avoid unnecessary and expensive investigations, incorrect diagnostic labelling and inappropriate long-term prevention treatment. Although the pathophysiology of ischaemic stroke and TIA is identical, and both require rapid and accurate diagnosis, the differential diagnosis differs for TIA owing to the transience of symptoms. For TIA the diagnostic challenge is greater, and the 'mimic' rate higher (and more varied), because there is no definitive diagnostic test. TIA heralds a high risk of early ischaemic stroke, and in many cases the stroke can be prevented if the cause is identified, hence the widespread dissemination of guidelines including rapid assessment and risk tools like the ABCD2 score. However, these guidelines do not emphasise the substantial challenges in making the correct diagnosis in patients with transient neurological symptoms. In this article we will mainly consider the common TIA mimics, but also briefly mention the rather less common situations where TIAs can look like something else ('chameleons').

### Pediatric stroke and its mimics: limitations of a pediatric stroke clinical pathway [^1171Tzhn]. Pediatric Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Acute stroke protocols improve delivery of care but it is unclear whether these resource intensive protocols are able to differentiate stroke from mimics in children. The aim of this study is to describe our institution's experience with stroke mimics identified through our pediatric stroke clinical pathway (PSCP).

Methods

The PSCP was implemented in our level 1 pediatric emergency department in June 2014 for children aged one month to 18 years. For patients managed using the PSCP from June 2014 to December 2016, demographic and clinical data were compared for patients diagnosed with stroke or a stroke mimic.

Results

A total of 59 children were evaluated with the PSCP. Fourteen children were identified as having a stroke and 45 children had stroke mimics. The most common stroke mimics were functional neurological disorders (20.0%), transient neurological deficits (17.8%), migraine (15.6%), and seizure (11.1%). Patient demographics and time to neuroimaging did not differ between patients with and without stroke. Vomiting was commonly reported by patients with stroke (odds ratio: 4.00, 95% confidence interval: 1.12 to 14.35), whereas weakness was not (odds ratio: 0.7, 95% confidence interval: 0.07 to 0.90), but the physical examination did not differ between patients with and without stroke.

Conclusions

The PSCP ensures timely evaluation of patients presenting with neurological deficits but fails to reliably differentiate between patients with stroke and patients with stroke mimics. Further multicentered studies are needed to develop a "stroke screen" that reliably distinguishes pediatric stroke from its mimics.

### An evidence-based causative classification system for acute ischemic stroke [^113siYuZ]. Annals of Neurology (2005). Low credibility.

Regular, evidence-based assignment of patients to etiologic stroke categories is essential to enable valid comparison among studies. We designed an algorithm (SSS-TOAST) that incorporated recent advances in stroke imaging and epidemiology to identify the most probable TOAST category in the presence of evidence for multiple mechanisms. Based on the weight of evidence, each TOAST subtype was subdivided into 3 subcategories as "evident", "probable", or "possible". Classification into the subcategories was determined via predefined specific clinical and imaging criteria. These criteria included published risks of ischemic stroke from various mechanisms and published reports of the strength of associations between clinical and imaging features and particular stroke mechanisms. Two neurologists independently assessed 50 consecutively admitted patients with acute ischemic stroke through reviews of abstracted data from medical records. The number of patients classified as "undetermined-unclassified" per the original TOAST system decreased from 38–40% to 4% using the SSS-TOAST system. The kappa value for inter-examiner reliability was 0.78 and 0.90 for the original TOAST and SSS-TOAST respectively. The SSS-TOAST system successfully classifies patients with acute ischemic stroke into determined etiologic categories without sacrificing reliability. The SSS-TOAST is a dynamic algorithm that can accommodate modifications as new epidemiological data accumulate and diagnostic techniques advance.

### Misdiagnosis of stroke in tissue plasminogen activator-treated patients: characteristics and outcomes [^117HzjXc]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Study Objective

Misdiagnosis of acute ischemic stroke is a risk inherent in treating patients with acute deficits, yet few data exist on the problem. We report an evaluation of emergency department misdiagnoses in patients treated with tissue plasminogen activator for acute ischemic stroke.

Methods

We conducted an observational study of 151 consecutive patients treated without an acute stroke team. Initial diagnosis was compared with interim and hospital discharge diagnoses. Separate analyses were performed for patients without a final diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke and for those without a final diagnosis of either acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack, combined.

Results

Ten of 151 patients (7%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 3% to 12%) had final diagnoses that did not include acute ischemic stroke. Six of 151 (4%; 95% CI 1% to 8%) had a final diagnosis other than acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (conversion disorder [4], complex migraine [1], and Todd's paralysis [1]). These "stroke mimics" had no intracranial hemorrhage (0%; 95% CI 0% to 31%), had less disability at discharge (modified Rankin Scale score mean ± SD, 2.2 ± 1.3 versus 3.2 ± 1.8), and were younger (mean age ± SD, 47 ± 21 years versus 68 ± 15 years) than patients with acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack. An additional 4 (3%) patients had interim diagnoses other than acute ischemic stroke, all subsequently changed to acute ischemic stroke after magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography.

Conclusion

These data show that in a 4-hospital system without an acute stroke team, thrombolytic treatment of patients with diagnoses mimicking stroke was infrequent, and hemorrhagic complications did not occur in any patients without an acute ischemic stroke. However, because the number of mimics was small, safety cannot be ensured with statistical confidence.

### Guidelines for the early management of patients with acute ischemic stroke: 2019 update to the 2018 guidelines for the early management of acute ischemic stroke: a guideline for healthcare professionals from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^116s8xcb]. Stroke (2019). High credibility.

Acute ischemic stroke emergency evaluation — stroke scales: The use of a stroke severity rating scale, preferably the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), is recommended. Formal stroke scores or scales such as the NIHSS may be performed rapidly, have demonstrated utility, and may be administered by a broad spectrum of healthcare providers with accuracy and reliability. Use of a standardized scale quantifies the degree of neurological deficit, facilitates communication, helps identify patients for fibrinolytic or mechanical intervention, allows objective measurement of changing clinical status, and identifies those at higher risk for complications such as intracerebral hemorrhage.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for acute ischemic stroke, more specifically with respect to brain CT/MRI, for acute evaluation, AHA/ASA 2021 guidelines recommend to consider obtaining follow-up MRI to predict the risk of early stroke and to support the diagnosis in patients with a suspected TIA, if the initial brain imaging (CT or MRI) does not demonstrate a symptomatic cerebral infarct.

### Magnetic resonance imaging of arterial stroke mimics: a pictorial review [^117SKuSd]. Insights Into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the best way to detect early signs of cerebral ischaemia and intracranial haemorrhage. Rapid MRI sequences reduce the length of the investigation, giving valuable information with an acceptable time in terms of patient care. For this reason, MRI is increasingly used to select candidates for thrombolysis. After a few minutes, acute arterial ischaemic stroke (AIS) appears as hyperintense on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), with a corresponding reduction of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC). However, DWI may also be negative at the very beginning of an ischaemic stroke, as it requires several tens of minutes for the cytotoxic oedema to return hyperintensity.

If AIS represents the most common cause of new sudden neurological deficit, other diseases mimicking ischaemic strokes represent up to one-third of cases and are termed 'stroke mimics'. It is important to promptly identify these differential diagnoses to avoid inappropriate urgent treatment, but also to prevent inadequate long-term prevention treatment. Though computed tomography (CT) scanning is the standard technique in many stroke centres around the world and has demonstrated its effectiveness in the decision-making process for the treatment of AIS, MRI with DWI has a better sensitivity to depict small acute ischaemic cerebral lesions, but also offers the possibility, at the same time, to identify differential diagnoses to stroke in case of a sudden neurological deficit.

Therefore, when performing MRI when faced with an acute neurological deficit, radiologists should be able to: (1) exclude haematoma, (2) confirm the positive diagnosis of AIS and (3) exclude 'stroke mimics'. In this review, we will recall the expected results of a simple magnetic resonance protocol in the case of AIS. Then, we will propose a practical illustrated algorithm of the main 'stroke mimics' based on the results of DWI. As previously mentioned, because DWI can be positive or negative in the case of AIS, stroke mimics can be dichotomised in the same way. Common additional magnetic resonance sequences then provide enough data to evoke substitute diagnoses (Fig. 1).

### Differentiating childhood stroke from mimics in the emergency department [^1115zVsg]. Stroke (2016). Low credibility.

Long delays in diagnosis of childhood stroke limit access to hyperacute interventions that improve outcome in adults. – However, a recent US study has demonstrated the benefits of developing a pediatric Code Stroke protocol for shortening time to diagnosis and increasing rates of thrombolysis and mechanical thrombectomy. Clinical differentiation of stroke from mimics by pediatric triage nurses and emergency physicians influences the decision-making process, in particular the rapidity of medical assessment, the need for emergent neuroimaging to confirm diagnosis, the initiation of antithrombotic treatment in ischemic stroke, and neurosurgical intervention in hemorrhagic stroke (HS). Correct clinical identification of stroke avoids unnecessary diagnostic or therapeutic procedures and allows early implementation of measures to maintain physiological homeostasis.

Three studies on adults have described clinical features that differentiate stroke from mimics. Focal neurological symptoms and signs were associated with increased odds of stroke, whereas loss of consciousness, altered mental state, dizziness, confusion, and seizures were associated with increased odds of mimic. – It may not be appropriate to extrapolate data from adults because of different presenting features, such as frequent occurrence of seizures, and the different spectrum of disorders that mimic childhood stroke.

Several prospective case series have reported the presenting features of childhood stroke, – but most have focused on arterial ischemic stroke (AIS), and none have explored differences between stroke and other conditions that mimic stroke. Therefore, our primary aim was to identify key clinical features that were positively and negatively associated with pediatric stroke, compared with mimics, in children presenting with brain attack symptoms. We hypothesized that the clinical features associated with stroke are similar to those of adults, with the exception of seizures.

### Development of a deep learning method to identify acute ischaemic stroke lesions on brain CT [^116nJc95]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Early detection of ischaemic stroke is important for improving patient outcomes due to the time-sensitive nature of available treatments. Accurate early detection influences several aspects of acute stroke management such as appropriate patient prioritisation in emergency settings, selection for treatment with thrombolysis and/or thrombectomy and the early initiation of secondary prevention measures which can reduce the risk of recurrent strokes.

However, despite its importance, early detection of ischaemic stroke presents several challenges such as the subtle presentation of early-stage lesions and the presence of stroke mimics and chameleons as demonstrated in a previous analysis of a commercially available tool which revealed many shortcomings.

The superior performance of our model on follow-up scans compared with baseline scans aligns with human diagnostic behaviour. Moreover, follow-up predictions still provide significant value in stroke management and patient care. They enable clinicians to evaluate the effectiveness of initial treatments and thereby better predict outcomes or plan additional interventions such as hemicraniectomy.

Since some stroke-related complications may not manifest during the acute phase, follow-up predictions can aid in detecting delayed issues such as cerebral swelling, haemorrhagic transformation or other secondary events. Additionally, tracking lesion progression offers valuable insights for shaping rehabilitation strategies allowing for personalised therapies based on the patient's evolving condition and recovery potential.

Interpretability of DL models, particularly in the context of medical imaging, is a challenging topic due to the so-called 'black box' nature of these models. However, understanding how these models arrive at their decisions is critical for ensuring their reliability and detecting any potential biases. To address this issue, we employed counterfactual explanations and generated saliency maps that highlight the most relevant parts of the images for our model's output. Our saliency maps showed that our DL algorithm was able to detect obvious ischaemic lesions with high accuracy while also indicating that the model was less certain about the location of more subtle lesions and may highlight regions outside the true lesion. This behaviour is consistent with that of humans.

### Differentiating childhood stroke from mimics in the emergency department [^111n8Fed]. Stroke (2016). Low credibility.

Variables collected included demographics and neurological symptoms and signs. Clinical variables were selected on the basis of being common presenting features of stroke or being discriminatory between stroke and mimics in the published studies on adults. – Key demographic factors and neurological symptoms variables were compared between the prospective and retrospective cerebrovascular patients to account for threats to study validity by ensuring both statistical and substantive similarity of the 2 cohorts.

Analyses were performed for the following outcomes: (1) combined stroke (AIS and HS) or TIA versus mimics, (2) AIS subtype versus mimics, and (3) HS subtype versus mimics. For simplicity, stroke and TIA are referred to as stroke in the combined analysis section of the results. Categorical variables are descriptively presented as counts and percentages. Continuous variables are presented as mean and standard deviation for normally distributed data or median and interquartile range for non-normally distributed data.

Logistic regression modeling was used to investigate associations between independent variables and stroke diagnosis. Selection of variables for regression analyses was determined by a combination of computational analyses and clinical importance. Variables were initially individually examined by univariate logistic regression for associations with the outcome of interest. Odds ratios (ORs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95%CIs) were estimated. Variables with P values of < 0.05 were considered for entry into the multivariable model to determine the adjusted association with the outcomes of interest for combined AIS and HS diagnoses versus mimics. Multivariable modeling was not performed for AIS or HS stroke subtypes versus mimics because of the relatively small sample sizes. Unadjusted (produced by univariate models) and adjusted (produced by multivariable models) ORs are presented with corresponding 95% CIs and P values. CIs not including 1 are indicative of statistical significance, with the P value set at 0.05. Standard analyses of model fit and excessive collinearity diagnostics were performed, including (1) computation of pairwise correlation coefficients to assess interdependence of causal variables and (2) measures of multicollinearity, including variance inflation factors and condition number, to determine whether there was a linear association between ≥ 2 predictor variables. Statistical analyses were performed using STATA 13 (StataCorp, TX). This study was reviewed and approved by the Royal Children's Hospital Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC30194A).

### Diagnosis of acute stroke [^111iNyU1]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Stroke can be categorized as ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, or subarachnoid hemorrhage. Awakening with or experiencing the abrupt onset of focal neurologic deficits is the hallmark of the diagnosis of ischemic stroke. The most common presenting symptoms of ischemic stroke are speech disturbance and weakness on one-half of the body. The most common conditions that can mimic a stroke are seizure, conversion disorder, migraine headache, and hypoglycemia. Taking a patient history and performing diagnostic studies will usually exclude stroke mimics. Neuroimaging is required to differentiate ischemic stroke from intracerebral hemorrhage, as well as to diagnose entities other than stroke. The choice of neuroimaging depends on availability of the method, the patient's eligibility for thrombolysis, and presence of contraindications. Subarachnoid hemorrhage presents most commonly with sudden onset of a severe headache, and noncontrast head computed tomography is the imaging test of choice. Cerebrospinal fluid inspection for bilirubin is recommended if subarachnoid hemorrhage is suspected in a patient with a normal computed tomography result. Public education about common presenting stroke symptoms may improve patient knowledge and clinical outcomes.

### Differentiating childhood stroke from mimics in the emergency department [^116dXLoj]. Stroke (2016). Low credibility.

We found that 16 variables were associated with combined stroke or mimic on univariate analysis but only 5 remained significant on multivariable analysis. Being well in the week before arrival, inability to walk, and examination findings of focal face or arm weakness were associated with stroke diagnosis, consistent with those in the literature on adults. Visual symptoms were not independently associated with stroke diagnosis, which may be explained by the different spectrum of disorders mimicking pediatric stroke. For example, visual disturbance is the most frequent type of aura in migraine, and migraine is the most common pediatric stroke mimic. Sudden symptom onset was not independently associated with stroke. The lack of independent association between sudden symptom onset and stroke may be because of selection bias, because brain attack symptoms were defined as acute-onset focal brain dysfunction, or variable interpretation of the term's meaning among ED physicians.

Equally important were the findings that seizures and loss of consciousness were not independently associated with mimic diagnosis, and therefore, in contrast to adults, they are not useful discriminators for mimic diagnosis in children. The relatively frequent occurrence of seizures in childhood stroke is well described in the pediatric literature, with reported rates ranging from 11% to 52% for ischemic stroke. and from 37% to 41% for HS. This contrasts with the low rates of seizures in adults, ranging from 0.5% to 11%. Increased rates of seizures may reflect age-related cortical hyperexcitability or decreased inhibitory influences in the developing brain. Loss of consciousness, which has been noted in 18% to 41% of adults with mimics, was also nondiscriminatory, occurring in low numbers of children in both groups. Differences in discriminatory factors between adults and children may also be related to the higher proportion of HS in children because presenting features differ by stroke subtype. Thirty-six percent of children in our stroke cohort had HS, consistent with the 37% to 46% rates reported in population-based studies. –

### Transient ischaemic attacks: mimics and chameleons [^117UWCA1]. Practical Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Summary

Suspected TIA remains a common and important diagnostic challenge for physicians in primary and secondary care, including neurologists. The transience of symptoms makes historical features paramount in establishing the diagnosis among the many 'mimics'. The pathophysiological differences between TIA and the most common mimics (including migraine, seizures and syncope) mean that careful consideration of clinical features can be very helpful in establishing the diagnosis. However, the clinical history does not allow complete certainty. Indeed, recent studies show that haemorrhagic cerebrovascular disease can mimic TIA (especially cortical superficial siderosis in association with cerebral amyloid angiopathy), with sometimes devastating consequences if antithrombotic drugs are started or continued; the proportion of patients with transient symptoms who may be harmed by incorrect diagnosis requires formal study. It nevertheless seems reasonable to recommend MRI (including optimum sequences to detect ischaemia and haemorrhage) as the imaging modality of choice in assessing TIA, since it may provide positive evidence of ischaemic injury and can exclude significant haemorrhage. Together with careful clinical evaluation this should allow the most effective distinction of TIA from the myriad of 'mimics'.

Acute ischemic stroke — IV alteplase general principles state that in patients eligible for IV alteplase, benefit of therapy is time dependent, and treatment should be initiated as quickly as possible (I A). In patients undergoing fibrinolytic therapy, physicians should be prepared to treat potential emergent adverse effects, including bleeding complications and angioedema that may cause partial airway obstruction (I B-NR). The potential risks should be discussed during IV alteplase eligibility deliberation and weighed against the anticipated benefits during decision-making (I C-EO). Treating clinicians should be aware that hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia may mimic acute stroke presentations and determine blood glucose levels before IV alteplase initiation, and IV alteplase is not indicated for nonvascular conditions (III: No Benefit B-NR). Because time from onset of symptoms to treatment has such a powerful impact on outcomes, treatment with IV alteplase should not be delayed to monitor for further improvement (III: Harm C-EO).

### Development of a deep learning method to identify acute ischaemic stroke lesions on brain CT [^1136mP9y]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Non-contrast-enhanced CT is the most commonly used brain imaging modality for stroke assessment in the acute setting due to its availability and speed. While brain CT in this context is primarily used to identify haemorrhage and other contraindications to thrombolytic therapy (eg, structural stroke mimics such as brain tumour) rather than to identify ischaemia, positive detection of an ischaemic lesion confirms the diagnosis and may improve implementation of thrombolysis and thrombectomy treatment pathways. Accurate identification of ischaemic features on CT can be challenging and depends on the reviewing clinicians experience (eg, stroke clinician vs radiologist vs trainees)and the scan timing (ischaemic lesions become more visible with time). Computer-aided diagnosis may reduce delays, improve consistency of image interpretationand increase treatment success. However, current techniques are still in development. While there are several commercially available systems that predict features or provide clinical scores from a brain CT scan for strokesuch as the Alberta Stroke Programme Early CT Score (ASPECTS), to the best of our knowledge these systems were developed using annotated images which (due to the effort required to produce these annotations, ie, to draw round the lesions) necessarily limits the size (and representativeness) of the imaging data set used for development. In addition, the precision of such annotations is not known but must directly affect the quality of future lesion detection using the system.

In this study, we aim to develop a deep learning (DL) method for acute ischaemic stroke lesion diagnosis using a large data set of routinely collected brain CT scans from an international multicentre clinical trial where expert readers have labelled the scans for ischaemic lesion presence, location and extent (and for various other acute and chronic brain features), without annotations. In other words, rather than indicating exactly what to look for in images, we allow the DL methodology to independently assess thousands of features within scans that may correctly indicate the presence of an ischaemic lesion. We also explore the interpretability of our model, the impact of different ischaemic lesion sizes and background conditions on its performance and quantify its agreement with the assessment of expert radiologists.

### Diagnosis of ischemic stroke [^111vF5Mn]. The American Journal of Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Early stroke management, and early initiation of secondary stroke prevention, may improve outcomes in patients with acute ischemic stroke. However, < 10% of patients with acute ischemic stroke arrive at the receiving hospital within 3 hours of symptom onset. Factors such as poor public awareness of symptoms, lack of rapid detection by emergency medical services (EMS), poor coordination between EMS and the hospital emergency department, or delay of diagnosis on arrival at the emergency department are all contributing factors in the failure to provide prompt diagnosis and treatment of acute ischemic stroke. This article focuses on the critical steps in diagnosing ischemic stroke, starting at the initial patient evaluation by emergency personnel. Stroke mimics and different imaging techniques that may be used in the differential diagnosis and evaluation of acute ischemic stroke are also discussed.

### Identification of acute stroke using quantified brain electrical activity [^111zkdrf]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives

Acute stroke is a leading cause of brain injury and death and requires rapid and accurate diagnosis. Noncontrast head computed tomography (CT) is the first line for diagnosis in the emergency department (ED). Complicating rapid triage are presenting conditions that clinically mimic stroke. There is an extensive literature reporting clinical utility of brain electrical activity in early diagnosis and management of acute stroke. However, existing technologies do not lend themselves to easily acquired rapid evaluation. This investigation used an independently derived classifier algorithm for the identification of traumatic structural brain injury based on brain electrical activity recorded from a reduced frontal montage to explore the potential clinical utility of such an approach in acute stroke assessment.

Methods

Adult patients (age 18 to 95 years) presenting with stroke-like and/or altered mental status symptoms were recruited from urban academic EDs as part of a large research study evaluating the clinical utility of quantitative brain electrical activity in acutely brain-injured patients. All patients from the parent study who had confirmed strokes, and a control group of stroke mimics (those with final ED diagnoses of migraine or syncope), were selected for this study. All stroke patients underwent head CT scans. Some patients with negative CTs had further imaging with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Ten minutes of electroencephalographic data were acquired on a hand-held device in development, from five frontal electrodes. Data analyses were done offline. A Structural Brain Injury Index (SBII) was derived using an independently developed binary discriminant classification algorithm whose input was specified features of brain electrical activity. The SBII was previously found to have high accuracy in the identification of traumatic brain-injured patients who were found to have brain injury on CT (CT+). This algorithm was applied to patients in this study and used to classify patients as CT+ or not CT+. Performance was assessed using sensitivity, specificity, and negative and positive predictive values (NPV, PPV).

Results

Forty-eight stroke patients (31 ischemic and 17 hemorrhagic) and 135 stroke mimic controls were included. Within the ischemic population, approximately half were CT- but later confirmed for stroke with MRI (CT-/MRI+). Sensitivity to stroke was 91.7%, specificity 50.4% (to stroke mimic), NPV 94.4%, and PPV 39.6%. Eighty percent of the CT-/MRI+ ischemic strokes were correctly identified at the time of the CT- scan.

Conclusions

Despite a small population and the use of a classifier without the benefit of training on a stroke population, these data suggest that a rapidly acquired, easy-to-use system to assess brain electrical activity at the time of evaluation of acute stroke could be a valuable adjunct to current clinical practice.

### Stroke mimics and acute stroke evaluation: clinical differentiation and complications after intravenous tissue plasminogen activator [^112aaGjn]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Intravenous tissue-plasminogen activator remains the only U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved treatment for acute ischemic stroke. Timely administration of fibrinolysis is balanced with the need for accurate diagnosis. Stroke mimics represent a heterogeneous group of patients presenting with acute-onset focal neurological deficits. If these patients arrive within the extended time window for acute stroke treatment, these stroke mimics may erroneously receive fibrinolytics.

Objective

This review explores the literature and presents strategies for differentiating stroke mimics.

Discussion

Clinical outcome in stroke mimics receiving fibrinolytics is overwhelmingly better than their stroke counterparts. However, the risk of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage remains a real but rare possibility. Certain presenting complaints and epidemiological risk factors may help differentiate strokes from stroke mimics; however, detection of stroke often depends on presence of posterior vs. anterior circulation strokes. Availability of imaging modalities also assists in diagnosing stroke mimics, with magnetic resonance imaging offering the most sensitivity and specificity.

Conclusion

Stroke mimics remain a heterogeneous entity that is difficult to identify. All studies in the literature report that stroke mimics treated with intravenous fibrinolysis have better clinical outcome than their stroke counterparts. Although symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage remains a real threat, literature searches have identified only two cases of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage in stroke mimics treated with fibrinolytics.

### External validation of e-ASPECTS software for interpreting brain CT in stroke [^115RX8XZ]. Annals of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

When software processing is successful, e‐ASPECTS has moderate diagnostic accuracy for stroke feature detection on CT. When used as indicated to detect acute MCA territory ischemia, e‐ASPECTS may be more sensitive but less specific than experts with more false positive results. Increased false positive results were also apparent for hemorrhage detection and among patients with a stroke mimic (even when we excluded those with visible abnormalities). We found a 10% failure rate for software processing. Our findings emphasize that e‐ASPECTS should only be used as indicated to assist experienced readers to identify possible findings and should not be used as a standalone diagnostic tool. Users should interpret software results with caution and, according to the clinical context, be capable of independently recognizing true ischemic, hemorrhagic, and mimic features on CT to counter software misclassification and if results are not provided. Users can improve software detection by inputting the side affected by stroke and by increasing image quality. Results may be less accurate in older patients and those with severe stroke. Given the rapid growth of AI software for medical imaging, it is important that early adoptions of these methods, such as for acute stroke imaging, are rigorously and independently assessed and that appropriate precedents for quality and clinical effectiveness are set. Further testing of AI software for stroke is required, especially prospective trials of clinical impact as we would expect for any new health care intervention. Ideally, these studies would include patients with suspected stroke, admitted to a range of centers reflecting different levels of expertise in stroke, randomized to clinical decisions with versus without software assistance, and should be completed before widespread software rollout.

### Stroke mimics and chameleons [^1148Pm82]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of acute stroke remains a clinical diagnosis in the initial phases of patient evaluation. There is a differential diagnostic process to the abrupt onset of focal neurologic deficit that characterizes an acute stroke. "Is this a CNS event?" might be the initial question posed by the clinician. The stroke mimics of systemic problems such as hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia, and other encephalopathies are considered. Certainly consideration of hypoglycemia, which is common, easily detectable, and correctable, should occur in every stroke patient encounter. Any witnesses that suggest a convulsive episode should raise suspicion of the presence of an ictal or postictal phenomena. Next, if a CNS event is believed to exist, the different stroke subtypes are considered along with other CNS events that may simulate stroke. The standard acute neuroimaging with noncontrast CT scanning uncovers some mass lesions mimicking stroke and confirm a stroke subtype in other patients. Ischemic stroke, like other common diseases, does have uncommon manifestations. Acute stroke is considered in neurologic syndromes in which abrupt onset of symptoms figure prominently, particularly in patients with cerebrovascular risk factors.

### Acute stroke diagnosis [^117UJaDt]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

Stroke can be categorized as ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, and subarachnoid hemorrhage. Awakening with or experiencing the abrupt onset of focal neurologic deficits is the hallmark of ischemic stroke diagnosis. The most common presenting symptoms for ischemic stroke are difficulty with speech and weakness on one half of the body. Many stroke mimics exist; two of the most common are a postictal seizure and hypoglycemia. Taking a detailed history and performing ancillary testing will usually exclude stroke mimics. Neuroimaging is required to differentiate ischemic stroke from intracerebral hemorrhage, as well as to diagnose entities other than stroke. The choice of neuroimaging depends on its availability, eligibility for acute stroke interventions, and the presence of patient contraindications. Subarachnoid hemorrhage presents most commonly with severe headache and may require analysis of cerebrospinal fluid when neuroimaging is not definitive. Public education of common presenting stroke symptoms is needed for patients to activate emergency medical services as soon as possible after the onset of stroke.

### The recognition of stroke in the emergency room (ROSIER) scale: development and validation of a stroke recognition instrument [^113Cj5Ab]. The Lancet: Neurology (2005). Medium credibility.

Background

In patients with acute stroke, rapid intervention is crucial to maximise early treatment benefits. Stroke patients commonly have their first contact with medical staff in the emergency room (ER). We designed and validated a stroke recognition tool-the Recognition of Stroke in the Emergency Room (ROSIER) scale-for use by ER physicians.

Methods

We prospectively collected data for 1 year (development phase) on the clinical characteristics of patients with suspected acute stroke who were admitted to hospital from the ER. We used logistic regression analysis and clinical reasoning to develop a stroke recognition instrument for application in this setting. Patients with suspected transient ischaemic attack (TIA) with no symptoms or signs when assessed in the ER were excluded from the analysis. The instrument was assessed using the baseline 1-year dataset and then prospectively validated in a new cohort of ER patients admitted over a 9-month period.

Findings

In the development phase, 343 suspected stroke patients were assessed (159 stroke, 167 non-stroke, 32 with TIA [17 with symptoms when seen in ER]). Common stroke mimics were seizures (23%), syncope (23%), and sepsis (10%). A seven-item (total score from -2 to +5) stroke recognition instrument was constructed on the basis of clinical history (loss of consciousness, convulsive fits) and neurological signs (face, arm, or leg weakness, speech disturbance, visual field defect). When internally validated at a cut-off score greater than zero, the instrument showed a diagnostic sensitivity of 92%, specificity of 86%, positive predictive value (PPV) of 88%, and negative predictive value (NPV) of 91%. Prospective validation in 173 consecutive suspected stroke referrals (88 stroke, 59 non-stroke, 26 with TIA [13 with symptoms]) showed sensitivity of 93% (95% CI 89–97), specificity 83% (77–89), PPV 90% (85–95), and NPV 88% (83–93). The ROSIER scale had greater sensitivity than existing stroke recognition instruments in this population.

Interpretation

The ROSIER scale was effective in the initial differentiation of acute stroke from stroke mimics in the ER. Introduction of the instrument improved the appropriateness of referrals to the stroke team.

### Novel screening tool for stroke using artificial neural network [^115qAgUR]. Stroke (2017). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

The timely diagnosis of stroke at the initial examination is extremely important given the disease morbidity and narrow time window for intervention. The goal of this study was to develop a supervised learning method to recognize acute cerebral ischemia (ACI) and differentiate that from stroke mimics in an emergency setting.

Methods

Consecutive patients presenting to the emergency department with stroke-like symptoms, within 4.5 hours of symptoms onset, in 2 tertiary care stroke centers were randomized for inclusion in the model. We developed an artificial neural network (ANN) model. The learning algorithm was based on backpropagation. To validate the model, we used a 10-fold cross-validation method.

Results

A total of 260 patients (equal number of stroke mimics and ACIs) were enrolled for the development and validation of our ANN model. Our analysis indicated that the average sensitivity and specificity of ANN for the diagnosis of ACI based on the 10-fold cross-validation analysis was 80.0% (95% confidence interval, 71.8–86.3) and 86.2% (95% confidence interval, 78.7–91.4), respectively. The median precision of ANN for the diagnosis of ACI was 92% (95% confidence interval, 88.7–95.3).

Conclusions

Our results show that ANN can be an effective tool for the recognition of ACI and differentiation of ACI from stroke mimics at the initial examination.

### Artificial intelligence to predict individualized outcome of acute ischemic stroke patients: the SIBILLA project [^116rFKiH]. European Stroke Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Materials and methods

Patient population

This is an observational study conducted on acute ischemic stroke patients admitted to Fondazione Policlinico Gemelli between July 2019 and June 2023. The cohort comprehended all consecutive patients who were discharged from the hospital with a diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke, identified through the ICD-9 code (International Statistical Classification of Diseases). Patients with haemorrhagic stroke and patients with stroke mimics were excluded from the study. There were no other inclusion or exclusion criteria, meaning any limit of age, etiology, clinical severity or type of acute revascularization treatment. This approach guarantees to assess a real-world scenario including a large range of patients' characteristics without selection according to anamnestic features, clinical severity, findings of laboratory exams, neuroimaging findings and type of acute treatment (thrombolysis/endovascular treatment). Moreover, missing data in any of the collected variables was not an exclusion criteria as our approach preserves the real-world setting where AI algorithms can add more trustworthy insight even with incomplete datasets. The study was approved by the ethics committee of Fondazione Policlinico Universitario A. Gemelli-IRCCS (prot n. 0020981/21).

### Thrombolysis in stroke mimics: frequency, clinical characteristics, and outcome [^111dMJjN]. Stroke (2009). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Intravenous thrombolysis for acute ischemic stroke is usually based on clinical assessment, blood test results, and CT findings. Intravenous thrombolysis of stroke mimics may occur but has not been studied in detail.

Methods

We determined frequency, clinical characteristics, and outcome of mimic patients versus patients with stroke treated with intravenous thrombolysis using data of a prospective, single-center thrombolysis data bank.

Results

Among 250 patients, 243 (97.2%) had strokes and 7 (2.8%) were mimics. Seizure was the most frequent diagnosis among mimics. There was a trend toward lower National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale scores in mimics (9.9 ± 4.2) compared with strokes (13.7 ± 5.4; P = 0.06). Global aphasia without hemiparesis was the presenting symptom in 3 (42.9%) mimics versus 8 (3.3%) strokes (P = 0.002). Orolingual angioedema, symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, and asymptomatic intracranial hemorrhage occurred in 3 (1.2%), 13 (5.3%), and 30 (12.3%) patients with stroke, but were absent in mimics. After 3 months, 6 (85.7%) mimics and 86 (35.4%) strokes had a modified Rankin Scale score of 0 to 1 (P = 0.01).

Conclusions

Only few patients receiving intravenous thrombolysis did eventually have a final diagnosis other than stroke, ie, mostly seizures. Their outcome was favorable. Although clinical features differed between the stroke and the mimic groups, the differences were not distinctive enough to allow assigning individual patients to either of the groups. Multimodal neuroimaging or electroencephalographic recordings may be helpful for this assignment. However, their potential benefit has to be weighed against the potential harm of delayed thrombolysis.

### Acute ischemic cerebrovascular syndrome: diagnostic criteria [^116Vz7Ad]. Stroke (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Existing diagnostic classification systems for cerebrovascular disease are based primarily on clinical impression of temporal features, clinical syndrome, inferred localization, or ischemic mechanism. Diagnostic certainty of the ischemic pathology based on supportive or refuting laboratory or radiological evidence has been of secondary importance.

Summary Of Comment

Acute ischemic cerebrovascular syndrome (AICS) describes a spectrum of clinical presentations that share a similar underlying pathophysiology: cerebral ischemia. Diagnostic criteria for AICS incorporate prior classification systems and currently available information provided by neuroimaging and laboratory data to define 4 categories ranging from "definite AICS" to "not AICS", which define the degree of diagnostic certainty.

Conclusions

Clinical trials testing new treatments for acute ischemic stroke or secondary stroke prevention should limit enrollment to patients with "definite" AICS whenever feasible.

### Differentiating childhood stroke from mimics in the emergency department [^117GYM1K]. Stroke (2016). Low credibility.

Materials and Methods

The study population comprised 2 groups of children presenting to the Royal Children's Hospital Melbourne Emergency Department (ED). The first consisted of a consecutive group of children with stroke mimics, presenting between July 2009 and December 2010. The second consisted of a mixed prospective and retrospective group of children with radiologically confirmed AIS, transient ischemic attack (TIA), and HS, presenting between January 2003 and December 2010 (Figure).

Figure.
Case ascertainment for stroke and mimic data sets. Causes of ischemic strokes/TIAs: focal cerebral arteriopathy 19 (29%), bilateral cerebral arteriopathy 14 (22%), arterial dissection 5 (8%), cardioembolic 3 (5%), other determined etiology 5 (7%), multifactorial etiologies 2 (3%), and undetermined 17 (26%). Causes of hemorrhagic strokes: arteriovenous malformation 20 (54%), cavernous malformation 3 (8%), arterial dissection 3 (5%), subarachnoid, cause undetermined 2 (5%) and because of aneurysm 1 (3%), tumor-related bleed 1 (3%), focal cerebral arteriopathy with ruptured collaterals 1 (3%), and undetermined 7 (19%). AIS indicates arterial ischemic stroke; CVST, cerebral sinus venous thrombosis; HS, hemorrhagic stroke; N, number; and TIA, transient ischemic attack. *Brain attack study.^Reasons for exclusion: CVST (1), direct admission to inpatient unit (5), and incomplete medical records (5).

Inclusion criteria, exclusion criteria, study procedure, and diagnostic definitions for the prospective cohort of patients with brain attack symptoms(defined as acute onset focal brain dysfunction) and retrospective stroke patientshave been previously described. Children with stroke mimics (including those presenting with a first seizure) had persistent neurological symptoms (headache, subjective visual or sensory disturbance) on presentation to the ED or abnormal neurological signs on examination. TIA required a known history of cerebrovascular disease, a clinical history typical of a vascular brain event with full resolution of symptoms within 24 hours, and absence of acute infarction on magnetic resonance imaging. There was no time limit on duration of symptoms after arrival at ED in the mimic group. The following stroke subgroups were excluded: perinatal stroke, cerebral sinovenous thrombosis, admission directly to the ward, and incomplete medical records. Children with subdural or extradural hemorrhage were also excluded.

Exploratory analyses suggest that factors that discriminate AIS from mimics are different from those that discriminate HS from mimics. In contrast to the analyses comparing all strokes to mimics, being well in the week before presentation was not associated with AIS, and face or arm weakness was not associated with HS. Understanding factors that discriminate ischemic or HS subtypes from mimics may assist the clinician in selecting the most appropriate neuroimaging modality to minimize delays and maximize diagnostic yield. However, magnetic resonance imaging has similar sensitivity to computed tomography for detection of hemorrhage, and recent studies have demonstrated feasibility of rapid magnetic resonance imaging screening protocols that avoid the need for anesthesia in young children.

Our study has limitations. The wide 95% CIs in the multivariable analyses for some signs suggest that the effect sizes need to be interpreted with caution. We did not have data on exact time of onset, assess for presence of positive signs in other systems, or use standardized stroke severity scales. Therefore, we were unable to assess the value of other factors that have been shown to be discriminatory in adults. The majority of our stroke group was identified retrospectively but we did not find significant differences in the presenting features when compared with the smaller prospective group. Relatively small numbers of children limited our ability to determine adjusted associations for the arterial ischemic and HS subgroups. Children with sinovenous thrombosis were excluded from the analyses and, therefore, they require further study. Accuracy of the clinical examination findings may have been influenced by level of experience of emergency physicians. The discriminatory values of conventional stroke risk factors were not assessed because the causes of stroke differ from adults. We did not assess the influence of discriminatory factors in AIS for anterior and posterior circulation. Finally, the study findings may not apply to children with in-hospital strokes, such as those with cardiac disease, because of differences in demographic factors, comorbid problems, such as infection, and presenting clinical features.

Development of ED brain attack protocolsand decision support tools to improve accuracy of stroke diagnosis by frontline emergency staff need to take into account differences between children and adultsand differences between ischemic stroke and HS subtypes. Further work is required to assess discriminatory factors for stroke compared with more common mimic diagnoses, such as migraine, and with less common but more serious diagnoses requiring rapid intervention, such as encephalitis, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, and central nervous system tumors.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the evaluation of adult patients with suspected transient ischemic attack in the emergency department [^116tGR7p]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Imaging objectives and timing definitions in suspected TIA — clinicians must choose between immediate and delayed imaging, with the primary goal "to identify serious TIA mimics (eg, intracranial hemorrhage, mass lesion)" and a secondary goal to identify patients at high short‑term stroke risk, "commonly defined as occurring within 2 or 7 days after the initial TIA event". Most literature concerns head CT, brain MRI, or cervical vessel imaging, and "The majority of studies… used a time-based definition of TIA (ie, resolution of neurologic deficit within 24 hours)". Immediate imaging "may reveal acute ischemic lesions… changing the diagnosis to stroke", and because "both TIA and minor stroke have similar short-term ischemic stroke risk", management may be similar regardless of tissue infarction on imaging.
