## Question

Do patients who are already on dapt need to be loaded prior to cag

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether patients who are already on dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) need a P2Y12 inhibitor loading dose prior to coronary angiography (CAG). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context, including whether this is elective diagnostic angiography versus ad hoc PCI, and whether the patient is on maintenance DAPT or is DAPT-naïve. Then, I should verify what contemporary guidelines say about pretreatment with P2Y12 inhibitors before angiography. Next, I will examine the pharmacologic rationale for or against reloading in someone already on maintenance therapy. After that, I should review randomized and observational data that inform timing and outcomes. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified recommendation and note exceptions such as ACS, high ischemic risk, or planned same-day PCI.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame. If the patient is already on maintenance DAPT (aspirin plus a P2Y12 inhibitor), the platelet P2Y12 pathway is already inhibited, so the question is whether an additional loading dose adds benefit or harm, especially when the plan is diagnostic angiography with possible ad hoc PCI versus a staged approach. I need to ensure I'm not conflating this with the DAPT-naïve scenario, where loading is standard before PCI and sometimes considered upstream in ACS depending on timing and bleeding risk [^113ao7iN] [^112PGgra].

> Next, I should review guideline direction on pretreatment before angiography. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — guidelines have evolved away from routine upstream P2Y12 loading before CAG. The 2021 ACC/AHA/SCAI guideline advises against routine pretreatment with P2Y12 inhibitors when coronary anatomy is unknown, largely due to bleeding risk and potential delays if CABG is needed, and it supports giving the P2Y12 load at or after PCI when anatomy is known [^113ao7iN] [^113GUSHa]. The 2025 ACC/AHA/ACEP ACS guideline similarly notes that with rapid access to angiography, preloading has not shown compelling benefit and may increase bleeding, aligning with a selective rather than routine approach [^112PGgra]. The Canadian CCS/CAIC 2023 update explicitly recommends avoiding routine pretreatment before elective angiography in suspected CAD, reinforcing the same principle [^114aBJGa].

> I will now examine the pharmacologic rationale. Wait, let me verify the onset and steady-state kinetics. Clopidogrel 600 mg achieves meaningful platelet inhibition within about 2 hours, and ticagrelor 180 mg within about 30 minutes; if a patient is already on maintenance therapy, steady-state inhibition is present, so a loading dose primarily accelerates inhibition that is already therapeutically active, which may not translate into added clinical benefit while still exposing patients to bleeding risk if surgery is needed or if the anatomy argues against PCI [^116LN7ki] [^114a7gxD]. I should double-check that this aligns with the notion that reloading is generally unnecessary unless there is a specific indication, such as a prolonged delay since the last dose or evidence of inadequate platelet inhibition.

> Next, I should review the randomized data that shaped this stance. The ACCOAST trial in NSTE-ACS showed that prasugrel pretreatment before angiography increased bleeding without reducing ischemic events, arguing against routine upstream loading in early invasive strategies [^112dWeAh]. ARMYDA-5 PRELOAD found no difference in 30-day MACE between in-lab 600 mg clopidogrel loading and a 4–8 hour preload, supporting in-lab loading when needed rather than routine pretreatment [^113bfpht]. PRAGUE-8 showed that nonselective 600 mg clopidogrel pretreatment before elective CAG increased minor bleeding without improving ischemic outcomes, again favoring selective in-lab loading only if PCI is planned [^116mA7QN]. Let me reconsider: these data collectively indicate that routine pretreatment before CAG does not improve outcomes and may increase bleeding, especially when PCI is not guaranteed.

> But wait, what if the patient is on clopidogrel and there is concern for inadequate platelet inhibition? The RELOAD study showed that in patients already on 75 mg clopidogrel, a 900 mg reload improved platelet inhibition at 4 hours compared with 300–600 mg, suggesting a pharmacodynamic benefit if under-inhibition is suspected; however, this is platelet-function data, not hard outcomes, and should be applied selectively rather than as a blanket strategy before diagnostic angiography [^117WCnEM]. I should confirm that this remains a niche consideration rather than standard pretreatment.

> I need to ensure I address ACS nuances. In ACS, guidelines still endorse DAPT with a potent P2Y12 inhibitor, and if angiography is anticipated to be delayed beyond 24 hours, upstream clopidogrel or ticagrelor may be considered to reduce events, balancing bleeding risk; however, when early invasive management is planned within 24 hours, routine pretreatment has not shown net benefit and may increase bleeding, so selective use is advised rather than automatic preloading [^115Tapsn] [^112PGgra]. Hold on, I should verify that this applies to patients already on maintenance DAPT as well; even in ACS, if the patient is already on a P2Y12 inhibitor, reloading is not routinely indicated unless there has been a lapse in therapy or a switch in agent.

> Let me synthesize a practical approach. For patients already on maintenance DAPT who are undergoing diagnostic CAG without a firm plan for same-day PCI, do not reload; if PCI is planned or likely, load in the lab after anatomy is known, choosing ticagrelor 180 mg or clopidogrel 600 mg based on bleeding risk and clinical context, and avoid routine upstream loading that could delay CABG or increase bleeding [^113ao7iN] [^117Dovfh]. If the patient is on clopidogrel and there is a prolonged delay since the last dose or concern for clopidogrel hyporesponsiveness, a selective reload may be considered, recognizing the evidence base is limited and decisions should be individualized [^117WCnEM]. I should confirm that this aligns with same-day discharge pathways emphasizing confirmation of P2Y12 loading before discharge when PCI is performed, underscoring that loading is tied to PCI rather than diagnostic angiography alone [^1136dcVz] [^114o2WYS].

> In summary, I should conclude clearly: No, patients already on DAPT do not need a P2Y12 inhibitor loading dose prior to diagnostic coronary angiography. Loading should be reserved for when PCI is planned or performed, ideally after coronary anatomy is known, to avoid unnecessary bleeding and surgical delays, with guideline-concordant exceptions in ACS when angiography is delayed and bleeding risk is acceptable [^113ao7iN] [^112PGgra] [^114aBJGa].

Patients already on DAPT **do not need an additional P2Y12 loading dose** before diagnostic coronary angiography [^113ao7iN]. Current guidelines advise against routine P2Y12 pretreatment when coronary anatomy is unknown, as it increases bleeding risk without proven ischemic benefit [^113GUSHa] [^116mA7QN]. If PCI is planned, give the P2Y12 load in the lab after anatomy is known; if PCI is unexpected, load immediately in the lab or use cangrelor for rapid effect [^116kWYfz] [^114a7gxD]. For patients already on clopidogrel, switching to a more potent agent (ticagrelor/prasugrel) is reasonable if high ischemic risk, but still load only after anatomy is known [^115Tapsn].

---

## Pharmacological rationale

- **Steady-state inhibition**: Patients on maintenance DAPT already have sustained P2Y12 inhibition; a loading dose adds little immediate benefit.
- **Time to effect**: Clopidogrel 600 mg reaches peak inhibition in ~2 hours; ticagrelor 180 mg in ~0.5–2 hours; reloading before CAG offers no advantage if already at steady state.
- **Bleeding risk**: Pretreatment increases bleeding, especially if CABG is needed, without proven ischemic benefit [^113GUSHa] [^116mA7QN].

---

## Clinical evidence

- **ARMYDA-5 PRELOAD**: In-lab 600 mg clopidogrel loading was noninferior to preloading 4–8 hours before PCI, with similar ischemic outcomes and no excess bleeding [^113bfpht].
- **PRAGUE-8**: Routine 600 mg clopidogrel pretreatment before elective CAG increased bleeding without reducing ischemic events; selective in-lab loading is preferred [^116mA7QN].
- **ACCOAST**: Prasugrel pretreatment in NSTE-ACS increased bleeding without ischemic benefit, arguing against routine upstream loading [^112dWeAh].

---

## Current guideline recommendations

| **Guideline** | **Recommendation regarding p2y12 loading before cag** |
|-|-|
| ACC/AHA/SCAI 2021 | - Do not routinely pretreat with P2Y12 inhibitors before CAG when anatomy is unknown [^113ao7iN] [^113GUSHa] <br/> - Load in-lab after anatomy is known if PCI is planned [^116kWYfz] |
| ESC 2020 | - Do not routinely pretreat before CAG in NSTE-ACS [^notfound] <br/> - Consider pretreatment only if angiography is delayed ≥ 24 hours and bleeding risk is low [^112PGgra] |
| CCS/CAIC 2023 | Avoid routine pretreatment with P2Y12 inhibitors before elective CAG [^114aBJGa] |

---

## Clinical scenarios and recommendations

- **Planned PCI**: Load in the lab after CAG confirms PCI is indicated; avoid upstream loading [^113ao7iN] [^116kWYfz].
- **Unexpected PCI**: Load immediately in the lab or use cangrelor for rapid effect [^113jKWYo] [^114a7gxD].
- **High ischemic risk**: Switching from clopidogrel to ticagrelor/prasugrel is reasonable, but still load only after anatomy is known [^115Tapsn].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Routine pretreatment**: Not recommended before diagnostic CAG [^113ao7iN] [^114aBJGa].
- **Planned PCI**: Load in the lab after CAG confirms PCI [^116kWYfz].
- **Unexpected PCI**: Load immediately in the lab or use cangrelor [^113jKWYo].
- **High ischemic risk**: Consider switching to a more potent P2Y12 inhibitor, but load only after anatomy is known [^115Tapsn].

---

Patients already on DAPT **do not need an additional P2Y12 loading dose** before diagnostic CAG; reserve loading for when PCI is planned or unexpectedly required, and prioritize in-lab administration to balance ischemic and bleeding risks [^113ao7iN].

### Oral dual antiplatelet therapy: what have we learnt from recent trials? [^111nHAYx]. European Heart Journal (2016). Low credibility.

International guidelines recommend the use of aspirin treatment immediately and indefinitely in coronary patients. The optimal time to start and the duration of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT; aspirin plus a P2Y12 inhibitor) have not been clearly established. Recent clinical trials have provided important new information allowing for evidence-based decisions regarding timing of initiation and duration of DAPT. The benefit-to-risk ratio of DAPT pre-treatment appears to depend on the type of acute coronary syndrome, the time until angiography, and the onset of action of the drug. In stable patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention with the latest generation drug-eluting stents, patients should be treated for at least ∼6 months. Shorter courses of therapy may be necessary when special conditions occur (e.g. surgery; oral anticoagulation). Longer courses of therapy may be reasonable in patients at low bleeding risk who are tolerating DAPT well. For patients with ACS, prolonged DAPT is beneficial and therefore reasonable as long as the patient is tolerating the therapy. Individualized management of DAPT must be seen as a dynamic prescription with regular re-evaluations of the risk-benefit to the patient according to changes in his/her clinical profile.

1 Introduction

Patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS), and especially ST‐elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), require urgent revascularisation with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with aspirin and a P2Y 12 inhibitor is standard therapy following PCI for ACS to prevent stent thrombosis and recurrent myocardial infarction. Given PCI often follows on from diagnostic coronary angiography for ACS, preloading with a P2Y 12 inhibitor alongside aspirin is often undertaken, variably timed from immediately before the PCI up to 24 h preprocedure as part of a preloading strategy. The main theoretical benefit of early dual antiplatelet loading is achieving maximal antiplatelet effect at the time of stent deployment, thereby mitigating the risk of stent thrombosis, which carries an estimated 20% risk of in‐hospital mortality. Conversely, the main limitation of P2Y 12 inhibitor preloading is an increased risk of bleeding — particularly coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) associated bleeding — if early surgical revascularisation is required following diagnostic angiography. As such, DAPT before determining coronary anatomy has been associated with delays of CABG in a subset of patients referred for angiography.

While P2Y 12 inhibitor preloading is commonly practiced, data are mixed regarding the efficacy of this approach. The CREDO trial showed a time dependent clinical benefit of clopidogrel loading. However, subsequent trials have shown no difference in preloading before PCI versus in‐lab or post PCI antiplatelet therapy (in both ACS and non‐ACS cohorts). As such, international practice guidelines have evolved over the last decade. In patients with ACS, American College of Cardiology (ACC) guidelines currently recommend a loading dose of DAPT before or at least at the time of PCI but do not recommend preloading before coronary anatomy is determined. In contrast, the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines recommend preloading with DAPT for patients with STE‐ACS as soon as the diagnosis is established but do not specify an exact time frame for doing so. ESC guidelines do not recommend preloading for NSTE‐ACS patients in whom coronary anatomy is unknown, and early invasive management is planned (< 24 h). There are limited data regarding the prevalence of DAPT before PCI for ACS in Australian cohorts. This study aimed to examine the prevalence of DAPT preloading in a contemporary population of Australian patients and determine its influence on clinical outcomes.

P2Y12 inhibitors in PCI — P2Y12 inhibitors are essential for treating patients undergoing PCI, and a loading dose of a P2Y12 agent should be given to minimize the time to platelet inhibition; however, there are conflicting data on pretreatment before the anatomy is known, and with most ACS patients undergoing early angiography, loading after the anatomy is known appears to offer similar benefit to preloading.

Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Conclusions — In randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with safer, newer-generation drug-eluting stents (DES), patients may be treated with a minimum DAPT duration of 3 to 6 months to prevent early and largely stent-related thrombotic events, but extension beyond 12 months entails a tradeoff; the declining risk of late stent thrombosis and inability to predict life-threatening bleeding limit the appeal of 18 to 48 months versus 6 to 12 months of therapy. In contrast, patients with prior MI at high risk of atherothrombosis experience fewer ischemic events with prolonged DAPT at a cost of increased bleeding events.

### 2021 ACC / AHA / SCAI guideline for coronary artery revascularization: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint Committee on Clinical practice guidelines [^113GUSHa]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

ACC/AHA/SCAI 2021 coronary revascularization — P2Y12 pretreatment before coronary angiography: Clopidogrel is the least potent agent, requiring longer time to platelet inhibition after a loading dose; in patients with stable angina, there is no compelling evidence to support routine pretreatment with a P2Y12 inhibitor before coronary angiography when the coronary anatomy is not known, and because the need for CABG still occurs in a nonnegligible proportion of patients referred for angiography, pretreatment can result in postponement of surgery.

In-hospital management of ACS — monitoring and antiplatelet loading considerations include that the optimal duration of telemetry monitoring with contemporary management is unclear, and the increasingly rapid triage and timing of invasive risk stratification calls into question the value of preloading of oral P2Y12 inhibitors (defined as administering the loading dose prior to coronary angiography), with clinical trials of preloading not showing a compelling benefit when coronary angiography occurs rapidly after the patient's clinical presentation.

### Role of antiplatelet therapy across the spectrum of patients with coronary artery disease [^111Dbgrz]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

Antiplatelet therapy is an important treatment modality across the spectrum of coronary artery disease manifestations. The role of aspirin in primary prevention continues to be refined. Although monotherapy with either aspirin or clopidogrel has been validated in secondary prevention, for high-risk patients such as those with acute coronary syndromes or requiring percutaneous coronary intervention, dual antiplatelet therapy appears to be most beneficial. Questions remain about the appropriate duration of dual antiplatelet therapy, especially in patients with prior ischemic events or in those receiving first-generation drug-eluting stents, with indirect evidence suggesting longer durations are better.

### Pharmacology before, during and after percutaneous coronary intervention [^113jKWYo]. Heart (2020). Medium credibility.

The failure of pretreatment with oral P2Y12 inhibitors in NSTE-ACS was surprising given the central role of platelets in atherothrombotic disease and raises questions about whether the mode of delivery — oral versus parenteral — could be important.

The evidence for GPI's pre-dates use of routine oral dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) and early invasive treatment. While early trials demonstrated a reduction in ischaemic events (largely reduction in myocardial infarction (MI)) in favour of GPI in combination with unfractionated heparin (UFH) compared with UFH alone, a consistent major bleeding risk was seen. Overall, there is no evidence for benefit of routine upstream GPI in patients scheduled for PCI and receiving DAPT treatment. With ticagrelor or prasugrel, randomised data with GPI use are limited; therefore, use of these agents for pretreatment is not recommended. Cangrelor also lacks evidence in the presence of prasugrel or ticagrelor.

In summary, aspirin (loading and maintenance) carries a IA recommendation for pretreatment in NSTE-ACS with ticragelor (180 mg) added as soon as the coronary anatomy is established (IIbC). If ticagrelor is unavailable, then clopidogrel 600 mg can be given but prasugrel is not recommended (IIIA). The use of cangrelor in P2Y12-naïve patients unable to take oral medication carries a IIbA recommendation. If the wait for coronary angiography is longer (> 24 hours), antiplatelet pretreatment should be considered.

With respect to anticoagulants, the OASIS-5 trial showed equivalence of fondaparinux (2.5 mg od subcutaneously) to heparin in reducing composite events but with a reduced risk of bleeding. As a result, fondaparinux carries a class IA recommendation for pretreatment of NSTE-ACS but patients should receive UFH during PCI. Where fondaparinux is not available, then enoxaparin (1 mg/kg two times a day, subcutaneously) is preferred (class IB).

### Clinical considerations with the use of antiplatelet therapy in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention [^112Sovo9]. Clinical Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

Despite the proven benefits of using antiplatelet therapy in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), a number of key questions remain to be answered. In recent years, clopidogrel dosing strategies among such patients have evolved considerably, with newer approaches involving loading doses prior to PCI and increases in the time interval and loading dosage in an effort to overcome variable responsiveness/hyporesponsiveness to platelet inhibition. Further, the role of glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa antagonists in elective stenting continues to be defined, with recent evidence suggesting that most appropriate use of these agents is in high-risk patients with elevated troponin levels. There appears to be a relationship between the use of GP IIb/IIIa antagonists with clopidogrel loading and attenuation of early inflammatory and cardiac marker release. Strategies to minimize the chance of late stent thrombosis in patients who receive drug-eluting stents (DES) are also under intense investigation. Among some patients receiving sirolimus and paclitaxel DES, current standard long-term antiplatelet strategies may be insufficient. Patient nonadherence to treatment and premature discontinuation and underutilization of antiplatelet therapies by physicians remain important clinical problems with potentially dire consequences.

### Pre-treatment with P2Y12 inhibitors in ACS patients: who, when, why, and which agent? [^111MpTSC]. European Heart Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with aspirin and a P2Y12receptor inhibitor is the mainstay of treatment for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients, whether they undergo a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or are managed medically. In recent years, the most appropriate timing for initiation and duration of P2Y12receptor inhibition has been a focus of great interest. Many observational studies and a single prospective trial (CREDO) utilizing clopidogrel had focused on whether pre-treatment with clopidogrel, i.e. its administration upstream of coronary angiography and PCI, is beneficial. Although the rationale for pre-treatment is obvious, large-scale randomized trials supporting a pre-treatment strategy with clopidogrel or with the newer P2Y12inhibitors prasugrel and ticagrelor did not exist. Proponents of a pre-treatment strategy had to rely on their best guess, on non-randomized studies, or on negative studies in which a trend for a benefit had been demonstrated. Recently, however, two randomized trials directly evaluated the value of pre-treatment-one in patients with a non-STE elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI)-the Comparison of Prasugrel at the Time of Percutaneous Coronary Intervention or as Pretreatment at the Time of Diagnosis in Patients with Non-ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction (ACCOAST) trial, and a second trial evaluating the use of ticagrelor in ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients, the Administration of Ticagrelor in the Cath Lab or in the Ambulance for New ST-elevation myocardial Infarction to open the Coronary artery (ATLANTIC) trial. Neither of the two trials, however, answered all the questions clinicians have about pre-treatment. And given the recent approval of the intravenous and rapidly acting P2Y12inhibitor cangrelor, the choice of who should receive treatment with a P2Y12inhibitor, which one should be used, and when it should be administered, should be carefully re-evaluated for all patients. This clinical review aims at evaluating the available evidence regarding the value of pre-treatment with the now four available oral and intravenous P2Y12inhibitors that can be administered to patients in whom coronary angiography followed by a possible PCI is planned.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2021). High credibility.

PCI with oral anticoagulation — preprocedural management is outlined as follows: For patients on a VKA presenting with ACS without ST-segment elevation who do not need urgent angiography, it may be necessary to bridge with unfractionated heparin or LMWH as the INR tapers; for those on a DOAC, there is likely no value in bridging. All patients should receive aspirin 162 to 325 mg preferably prior to the catheterization procedure. A loading dose of a P2Y12i should be given in the preprocedural period; because clopidogrel is the recommended agent in these patients, a 600-mg loading dose would be used.

### Association of same-day antiplatelet loading and outcomes after transcarotid artery revascularization [^1125ERPt]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Prior studies have emphasized the importance of compliance with preoperative dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) in patients undergoing transcarotid artery revascularization (TCAR). This investigation examines differences in perioperative outcomes after TCAR in those receiving a loading dose of antiplatelet medications on the day of the procedure vs those already maintained on DAPT.

Methods

Consecutive TCAR procedures from the Vascular Quality Initiative (2016–2022) were identified. Patients were divided into (1) those on preoperative DAPT (aspirin and P2YI2 antagonist) taken at least within 36 hours of the procedure (61.9%); (2) those on at least one antiplatelet medication who received a supplemental dose of another antiplatelet within 4 hours before the procedure (AP + loading, 37.1%); and (3) patients receiving only a loading dose (of aspirin or P2Y12 antagonist) without prior use of antiplatelet therapy (1%). In-hospital and 30-day outcomes were compared between the three groups using univariable and multivariable analyses.

Results

A total of 22,310 patients were on DAPT; 13,392 were on at least one antiplatelet and received a supplemental dose (AP + loading) and 361 patients received a loading dose on the day of the intervention. On univariable analysis, there was no significant difference in in-hospital or 30-day outcomes between the three groups, except for an increased rate of in-hospital stent thrombosis/occlusion in patients loaded with antiplatelet medications on the day of TCAR (n = 2 [0.6%]), compared with those maintained on DAPT (n = 23 [0.1%]) and patients in the AP + loading group (n = 26 [0.2%]) (P = 0.01). After adjusting for baseline differences between the three groups, no significant association was observed between the groups and in-hospital stroke/death or bleeding complications. However, compared with patients maintained on DAPT, patients receiving antiplatelet loading had higher odds of stent thrombosis/occlusion (odds ratio, 1.92; 95% confidence interval, 1.08–3.4; P = 0.03). Among patients in the AP + loading group, those maintained on aspirin preoperatively and receiving another antiplatelet loading on the day of the intervention were more likely to have stent thrombosis.

Conclusions

This study demonstrates that administering loading or supplemental doses of antiplatelet medication(s) to rapidly achieve therapeutic levels on the day of TCAR is not associated with higher rates of in-hospital stroke or bleeding complications. However, an increase in stent thrombosis or occlusion was noted in patients receiving a loading dose or supplementation of antiplatelet medications and warrants further investigation. In elective cases, it might be safer to delay intervention until patients receive adequate DAPT regimen, especially if patients are not maintained on P2Y12 inhibitors preoperatively.

### Early and sustained dual oral antiplatelet therapy following percutaneous coronary intervention: a randomized controlled trial [^1147xEiC]. JAMA (2002). Excellent credibility.

Context

Following percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), short-term clopidogrel therapy in addition to aspirin leads to greater protection from thrombotic complications than aspirin alone. However, the optimal duration of combination oral antiplatelet therapy is unknown. Also, although current clinical data suggest a benefit for beginning therapy with a clopidogrel loading dose prior to PCI, the practical application of this therapy has not been prospectively studied.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefit of long-term (12-month) treatment with clopidogrel after PCI and to determine the benefit of initiating clopidogrel with a preprocedure loading dose, both in addition to aspirin therapy.

Design, Setting, and Participants

The Clopidogrel for the Reduction of Events During Observation (CREDO) trial, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted among 2116 patients who were to undergo elective PCI or were deemed at high likelihood of undergoing PCI, enrolled at 99 centers in North America from June 1999 through April 2001.

Interventions

Patients were randomly assigned to receive a 300-mg clopidogrel loading dose (n = 1053) or placebo (n = 1063) 3 to 24 hours before PCI. Thereafter, all patients received clopidogrel, 75 mg/d, through day 28. From day 29 through 12 months, patients in the loading-dose group received clopidogrel, 75 mg/d, and those in the control group received placebo. Both groups received aspirin throughout the study.

Main Outcome Measures

One-year incidence of the composite of death, myocardial infarction (MI), or stroke in the intent-to-treat population; 28-day incidence of the composite of death, MI, or urgent target vessel revascularization in the per-protocol population.

Results

At 1 year, long-term clopidogrel therapy was associated with a 26.9% relative reduction in the combined risk of death, MI, or stroke (95% confidence interval [CI] 3.9%-44.4%; P = 0.02; absolute reduction, 3%). Clopidogrel pretreatment did not significantly reduce the combined risk of death, MI, or urgent target vessel revascularization at 28 days (reduction, 18.5%; 95% CI, -14.2% to 41.8%; P = 0.23). However, in a prespecified subgroup analysis, patients who received clopidogrel at least 6 hours before PCI experienced a relative risk reduction of 38.6% (95% CI, -1.6% to 62.9%; P = 0.051) for this end point compared with no reduction with treatment less than 6 hours before PCI. Risk of major bleeding at 1 year increased, but not significantly (8.8% with clopidogrel vs 6.7% with placebo; P = 0.07).

Conclusions

Following PCI, long-term (1-year) clopidogrel therapy significantly reduced the risk of adverse ischemic events. A loading dose of clopidogrel given at least 3 hours before the procedure did not reduce events at 28 days, but subgroup analyses suggest that longer intervals between the loading dose and PCI may reduce events.

### Dose effect of clopidogrel reloading in patients already on 75-mg maintenance dose: the reload with clopidogrel before coronary angioplasty in subjects treated long term with dual antiplatelet therapy (RELOAD) study [^117WCnEM]. Circulation (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Clopidogrel loading has mostly been studied in clopidogrel-naïve patients. Whether clopidogrel-treated patients readmitted for an acute coronary syndrome or percutaneous coronary intervention can benefit from a new load of clopidogrel and at what dose remain unknown. Our aim was to evaluate the impact of 3 different strategies of administration of a loading dose of 900 mg clopidogrel in patients already treated with a maintenance dose of 75 mg clopidogrel for at least 7 days on residual platelet aggregation.

Methods and Results

Patients treated long term by clopidogrel 75 mg/d were assigned to receive a first loading dose of 300, 600, or 900 mg clopidogrel and 4 hours later a second loading dose of 600, 300, or 0 mg, respectively, to achieve a total loading dose of 900 mg in all patients. Platelet aggregation was evaluated at baseline, at 4 hours after the initial load (and before second load), and at 24 hours using light transmission aggregometry with 20 micromol ADP and the point-of-care assay VerifyNow P2Y(12). The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the inhibition (relative change) of residual platelet aggregation (percentage of IRPA) between 600- and 900-mg first loading at 4 hours. IRPA at 24 hours also was evaluated as a secondary objective, as well as the rate of suboptimal response at 4 hours defined as IRPA < 10%. We included 166 consecutive patients with acute coronary syndromes (n = 80, 48%) or stable coronary artery disease (n = 86, 52%). Baseline characteristics were similar in the 3 dose groups. A significant stepwise increase was found in percentage IRPA assessed at 4 hours in patients initially assigned to 300 versus 600 versus 900 mg (30.7% versus 40.3% versus 64.0%, respectively; P = 0.0024). The difference in percentage IRPA at 4 hours was not significant between 300 and 600 mg but was significant between 600 and 900 mg and between 300 and 900 mg. Percentage IRPA assessed at 24 hours when all patients had received 900 mg did not differ between the 3 loading regimens. The rates of suboptimal response (IRPA < 10% at 4 hours) were 23.6%, 20.4%, and 5.3% with 300, 600, and 900 mg, respectively (P = 0.02 for all).

Conclusions

In patients treated long term with 75 mg clopidogrel, a new loading dose of 900 mg improves IRPA and reduces poor and/or slow response to clopidogrel significantly more than that obtained with 300 or 600 mg.

### Clopidogrel pre-treatment in stable angina: for all patients > 6 h before elective coronary angiography or only for angiographically selected patients a few minutes before PCI? A randomized multicentre trial PRAGUE-8 [^111t5zmX]. European Heart Journal (2008). Low credibility.

Introduction

The introduction of thienopyridines to interventional cardiology 13 years ago triggered a revolutionary change — it made coronary stent implantation a safe procedure: the risk of stent thrombosis decreased from 8% (with the old complex anticoagulation regimen) to 1–2% (with thienopyridine and aspirin) and the risk of significant bleeding complications decreased from 5 to 1–2%. Ticlopidine and later clopidogrelbecame a routine part of every percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Later, the CREDOand PCI-CUREtrials showed that the patients pre-treated with clopidogrel have a lower risk of periprocedural ischaemic events. Clopidogrel became widely used for patients undergoing PCI. However, the loading dose given before PCI varies among different clinical trials and different hospitals. The approved loading dose is 300 mg. However, 600 mg loading dose was shown to be superior in a small randomized trialand is used with increasing frequency with supporting data from trials in acute coronary syndromes. – These two loading doses are compared in the ongoing large randomized multicentre trial CURRENT/OASIS-7. Recommended time for the loading dose is > 6 h before PCI. However, nearly all PCIs are currently performed as ' ad hoc ' procedures [i.e. immediately following the diagnostic coronary angiography (CAG)], and thus the time between the decision to intervene and PCI procedure is just a few minutes. Due to this fact, some hospitals administer the loading dose of clopidogrel in advance to all patients undergoing CAG, others administer it during the procedure (i.e. after CAG) only to those undergoing PCI. It has not been established yet which of these strategies is better. Most Czech PCI centres have been using clopidogrel before PCI 'selectively' (i.e. in the cath-lab between CAG and PCI or even after PCI) in their routine practice for many years. When the new ESC guidelines for PCI were published in 2005, five study centres decided to compare their routinely used 'old selective' strategy with the ESC guidelines recommended 'new non-selective' strategy and the PRAGUE-8 trial design was born.

### More, more, more: reducing thrombosis in acute coronary syndromes beyond dual antiplatelet therapy-current data and future directions [^111mhdVF]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

In addition, avoiding more potent antiplatelet therapies in patients with prior gastrointestinal bleed or intracranial hemorrhage also seems prudent, and such patients were excluded from most recent trials. Risk scores are available and may be considered to identify patients at high bleeding risk. 38 The PRECISE‐DAPT (Predicting Bleeding Complications in Patients Undergoing Stent Implantation and Subsequent Dual Antiplatelet Therapy) 40 or PARIS (Patterns of Nonadherence to Antiplatelet Regimen in Stented Patients) 41 scores in patients receiving coronary stents and treated with DAPT have been shown to be predictive of bleeding, but prospective validation in randomized controlled trials is lacking. 38 Other risk scores for bleeding can be helpful, including HASBLED (Hypertension, Abnormal liver/renal function, Stroke history, Bleeding predisposition, Labile international normalized ratio, Elderly, Drug/alcohol usage), 42 validated predominantly in patients with atrial fibrillation taking warfarin, or CRUSADE (Can Rapid Risk Stratification of Unstable Angina Patients Suppress Adverse Outcomes With Early Implementation of the ACC/AHA Guidelines) and ACUITY (Acute Catheterization and Urgent Intervention Triage Strategy) scores in ACS patients undergoing coronary angiography. 43, 44 There is clearly a need to identify circulating biomarkers that reflect platelet, inflammatory, coagulation, and endothelial function that identify patients at risk of bleeding and thrombosis and to incorporate those markers into trials for prospective validation.

### Effect of timing of clopidogrel administration on 30-day clinical outcomes: 300-mg loading dose immediately after coronary stenting versus pretreatment 6 to 24 hours before stenting in a large unselected patient cohort [^112R8iQ3]. American Heart Journal (2007). Low credibility.

Background

The aim of our prospective multicenter Clopidogrel Registry was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a 300-mg loading dose of clopidogrel at the time of ad hoc stenting in patients with suspected coronary artery disease who were not pretreated with clopidogrel for any reason, and to compare the 30-day clinical event rates with the outcome of patients pretreated with a loading dose of clopidogrel 6 to 24 hours before stenting.

Methods

Between March 2002 and February 2004, 4160 consecutively included patients received a 300-mg loading dose of clopidogrel immediately after (group 1, n = 2679) or 6 to 24 hours before stenting (group 2, n = 1481).

Results

The primary end point (triple composite end point of acute myocardial infarction, all-cause death, and urgent repeat target vessel revascularization) at 30 days occurred in 4.74% versus 2.77% in groups 1 and 2, respectively (P = 0.002). The secondary end point events, the stent thrombosis, occurred significantly more frequently in group 1, with a trend toward increase in incidence of death, target vessel revascularization, or need for glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonists during percutaneous coronary intervention. Pretreatment with clopidogrel was associated with more major bleeding (secondary safety end point) (0.41% vs 1.35% in groups 1 and 2, respectively; P = 0.001).

Conclusions

The results of our multicenter prospective Clopidogrel Registry demonstrate lower efficacy of a 300-mg loading dose of clopidogrel at the time of stenting compared with pretreatment 6 to 24 hours before percutaneous coronary intervention on the 30-day composite clinical end point in the large unselected patient cohort, which suggests the benefit of clopidogrel pretreatment in all incoming patients with suspected significant coronary artery disease scheduled for coronary angiography.

### High-dose clopidogrel loading in percutaneous coronary intervention [^116LN7ki]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the use of a 600-mg clopidogrel loading dose in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).

Data Sources

Human clinical trials and platelet studies available through PubMed (1966-March 2005), bibliographies of pertinent articles, and citations supplied by the drug manufacturer were accessed.

Data Synthesis

The administration of a 600-mg loading dose of clopidogrel can decrease the time required for maximum platelet inhibition to 2 hours compared with ≥ 6 hours achieved with 300 mg. This higher loading dose has been investigated in multiple platelet studies and one observational report. Several randomized controlled trials have used a 600-mg loading dose; however, these studies were not designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of this loading regimen. To date, only one randomized trial has compared the 600-mg loading dose with a 300-mg loading dose.

Conclusions

When compared with a conventional loading regimen of 300 mg in lower-risk patients, pretreatment with clopidogrel 600 mg was shown to be more effective in reducing periprocedural events and demonstrated similar safety. Studies are needed to clarify the use of a 600-mg loading dose in higher-risk patients, with concomitant glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor antagonism, or when administration is delayed until immediately before or after PCI.

Acute coronary syndromes — P2Y12 pretreatment before PCI: In a prospective substudy of CURE, patients who underwent PCI (n = 2658) and were pretreated with clopidogrel (median 6 days) had a significantly lower rate of MACE both before PCI and by 30 days, and a meta-analysis found pretreatment with clopidogrel significantly reduced the risk for 30-day cardiovascular death or MI. In contrast, in a randomized trial of prasugrel pretreatment versus administration at the time of PCI, pretreatment (median of only 4.4 hours) did not improve ischemic outcomes, but significantly increased bleeding. For this reason, routine pretreatment in patients undergoing an early invasive management strategy (< 24 hours) is not supported by clinical trial data; however, it may be reasonable to consider pretreatment with clopidogrel or ticagrelor when the timing of angiography is anticipated to be ≥ 24 hours from administration of the loading dose.

Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2021). High credibility.

SCAI expert consensus — medications (antiplatelet agents) — states that loading before the procedure with a P2Y12 inhibitor is reasonable, although there is no evidence that pre-loading decreases ischemic complications compared to loading at the time of PCI or at its conclusion, and delaying P2Y12 loading until anatomy is known may prevent delays if that anatomy demonstrates a need for CABG; patient medications should be reviewed with attention to those that might impact the conduct or outcome of the procedure.

### Aspirin-free antiplatelet strategies after percutaneous coronary interventions [^114CX3ES]. European Heart Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with aspirin and a platelet P2Y12 receptor inhibitor is the standard antithrombotic treatment after percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI). Several trials have challenged guideline-recommended DAPT after PCI by testing the relative clinical effect of an aspirin-free antiplatelet approach-consisting of P2Y12 inhibitor monotherapy after a short course (mostly 1–3 months) of DAPT-among patients undergoing PCI without a concomitant indication for oral anticoagulation (OAC). Overall, these studies have shown P2Y12 inhibitor monotherapy after short DAPT to be associated with a significant reduction in the risk of bleeding without an increase in thrombotic or ischaemic events compared with continued DAPT. Moreover, the effects of the P2Y12 inhibitor monotherapy without prior DAPT or following a very short course of DAPT after PCI are being investigated in emerging studies, of which one has recently reported unfavourable efficacy results associated with the aspirin-free approach compared with conventional DAPT. Finally, P2Y12 inhibitor alone has been compared with aspirin alone as chronic therapy after DAPT discontinuation, thus challenging the historical role of aspirin as a standard of care for secondary prevention following PCI. A thorough understanding of study designs, populations, treatments, results, and limitations of trials testing P2Y12 inhibitor monotherapy vs. DAPT or vs. aspirin is required to consider adopting this treatment in clinical practice. This review addresses the use of aspirin-free antiplatelet strategies among patients undergoing PCI without a concomitant indication for OAC, providing an overview of clinical evidence, guideline indications, practical implications, ongoing issues, and future perspectives.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Acute coronary syndromes — pretreatment with P2Y12 inhibitors around percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) shows time-dependent evidence and conditional use. In a CURE substudy of patients who underwent PCI (n = 2658), pretreatment with clopidogrel (median 6 days) before PCI was associated with a significantly lower rate of MACE both before PCI and by 30 days, and a meta-analysis found that clopidogrel pretreatment significantly reduced the risk for 30-day cardiovascular death or MI. In a randomized trial of prasugrel, pretreatment (median time of only 4.4 hours) did not improve ischemic outcomes but significantly increased bleeding, and it remains unknown whether a benefit exists for administration of ticagrelor prior to PCI in patients with NSTE-ACS. For patients undergoing an early invasive management strategy, routine pretreatment (< 24 hours) is not supported by clinical trial data, but it may be reasonable to consider pretreatment with clopidogrel or ticagrelor when angiography is anticipated to be ≥ 24 hours from administration of the loading dose.

### Extended duration of dual-antiplatelet therapy after percutaneous coronary intervention: how long is too long? [^115eYUqy]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

The most recent American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines on duration of dual‐antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with drug‐eluting stents (DESs) give a class I recommendation to continue DAPT for at least 12 months after an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and at least 6 months after revascularization in the setting of stable ischemic heart disease. 1 These guidelines also give a class IIb recommendation for continuation of DAPT beyond 6 and 12 months in patients with stable ischemic heart disease and ACS, respectively, if these patients have tolerated DAPT without a bleeding event and are at low risk for bleeding in the future. 1 However, they do not provide any guidance with respect to how long DAPT should be continued and leave it to the clinician to discuss the risks versus benefits with the patient and individualize antiplatelet therapy. Therefore, in clinical practice, we often see patients on DAPT several years after a PCI as they are instructed by their providers to never discontinue them. In fact, given how much the importance of taking DAPT in the early period after PCI is emphasized, patients at times are uncomfortable stopping the second antiplatelet agent at any time. The lack of a clear recommendation is not surprising, despite multiple recent randomized controlled trials 2, 3, 4, 5 evaluating differing durations of extended DAPT given several evolving factors and the overall risk/benefits of DAPT.

Guidelines commenting on DAPT duration have largely included trials using clopidogrel and early‐generation stents. The advent of more potent P2Y 12 inhibitors, such as prasugrel and ticagrelor, has reduced major adverse cardiovascular events, but at the cost of increased bleeding. 6, 7 On the other hand, the newer‐generation DESs, with their thinner stent struts, a more biocompatible polymer, and favorable drug‐eluting characteristics, have considerably decreased the risk of stent thrombosis, particularly late stent thrombosis. 8 Although extended DAPT duration has been associated with reduction in recurrent myocardial infarction (MI) and cardiovascular death, there are statistically significant increases in major bleeding events. 2, 5 With the increased recognition of bleeding events and advancements in DES technology, it has been hypothesized that shorter durations of DAPT may be more appropriate. The European and American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines have already reduced the minimum absolutely required duration of DAPT by incorporating short DAPT into their recommendations. 1, 9 However, the question about the value of extended DAPT duration in selected patients still remains to be answered.

Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Meta-analysis of prolonged dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) among patients treated with PCI for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or MI found that extended DAPT decreased the risk of MACE (6.4% versus 7.5%; RR: 0.78; 95% CI: 0.67 to 0.90; P = 0.001) without an effect on all-cause death (RR: 0.92; 95% CI: 0.83 to 1.03; P = 0.13), whereas a complementary analysis suggested weak evidence of increased mortality rate with prolonged DAPT in the cohort of patients without a prior history of ACS.

### Prognostically relevant periprocedural myocardial injury and infarction associated with percutaneous coronary interventions: a consensus document of the ESC working group on cellular biology of the heart and European association of percutaneous cardiovascular interventions (EAPCI) [^114a7gxD]. European Heart Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

The 2017 ESC focused update on dual anti-platelet therapy (DAPT) in CAD recommends clopidogrel (600 mg loading dose, 75 mg daily dose) in addition to aspirin in CCS patients undergoing planned PCI (IA recommendation). This is supported by recent studies in CCS patients undergoing PCI reporting that pre-treatment with the potent platelet P2Y 12 inhibitors ticagrelor (pre-PCI and daily for 30 days)or prasugrel (pre-PCI only), did not reduce periprocedural myocardial injury or MI, with ticagrelor being associated with an increased risk of minor bleeding at 30 days, when compared with clopidogrel. For DAPT-naïve CCS patients who require PCI following diagnostic coronary angiography, it is probably advisable to delay PCI by > 2 h or even to the next day, given that a 600 mg loading dose of clopidogrel acts in ∼2 h. However, in those rare instances where ad-hoc PCI is urgently required in DAPT-naïve CCS patients, oral loading with soluble aspirin and ticagrelor or crushed prasugrel may be considered given their faster onset of action (30 min), with clopidogrel given thereafter (600 mg loading dose, 75 mg daily dose). In cases of urgent complex ad-hoc PCI in DAPT-naïve CCS patients, one may also consider intravenous fast-acting cangrelor to achieve rapid platelet inhibition at time of PCI, based on the results of the CHAMPION PHOENIX trial.

Several other therapeutic strategies have been evaluated for their ability to prevent periprocedural myocardial injury and type 4a MI in CCS patients when given prior to PCI (Table 3). Of these, there is substantial evidence to show that high-dose statins (e.g. atorvastatin 80 mg or rosuvastatin 40 mg) administered prior to PCI can reduce the risk of periprocedural myocardial injury, type 4a MI, and MACE in CCS patients. Low-dose treatment with the anti-inflammatory agent, colchicine, has been reported to reduce mainly ischaemia-driven clinical events in patients with recent MIand in CCS patients. However, pre-treatment of CCS with high-dose colchicine prior to PCI failed to reduce the incidence of periprocedural myocardial injury (as defined by the 4th UDMI), type 4a MI, or SCAI-defined periprocedural MI, when compared with placebo. Whether post-PCI treatment with low-dose colchicine can reduce MACE in CCS patients experiencing type 4a MI post-PCI is not known.

Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) is the cornerstone of pharmacological treatment aimed at preventing the atherothrombotic complications in patients with a variety of coronary artery disease (CAD) manifestations. Prescribers of DAPT are confronted with a number of challenges that include selecting the appropriate P2Y 12 inhibitor and determining the optimal duration of DAPT with the scope of minimizing the risk of ischemic and bleeding complications in light of each patient's clinical characteristic and circumstance. Recently, a guideline writing committee from the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) and a task force from the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) released their respective focused update recommendations on "Duration of DAPT in Patients with CAD" (ACC/AHA) and "DAPT in CAD" (ESC). This paper aims to review the ACC/AHA and ESC updates for DAPT to delineate common domains, consistent messages, and differences in recommended management strategies across the Atlantic.

### Benefits and risks of clopidogrel use in patients with coronary artery disease: evidence from randomized studies and registries [^111EGW8A]. Clinical Therapeutics (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Aggressive antiplatelet treatment is currently an established practice in patients with coronary artery disease.

Objective

This article discusses the evidence from clinical trials and registries concerning the benefits and risks of clopidogrel in relation to the dose and timing of treatment and its use in particular patient populations (stratified by risk factors for major adverse cardiovascular events).

Methods

Human clinical trials, registries, and in vitro human platelet studies were identified through searches of MEDLINE, Scopus, Google Scholar, and ClinicalTrials.gov (January 1980-July 2008) using the terms clopidogrel in coronary artery disease, clopidogrel loading dose, clopidogrel pretreatment, and antiplatelet therapy for coronary artery disease. For inclusion in the review, publications had to compare clopidogrel administered at different doses and times across the spectrum of patients with coronary artery disease; present outcome data on mortality, reinfarction, stroke, or their combination; and report safety data pertaining to bleeding risk.

Results

The results of randomized trials support the benefit of administering a 300-mg loading dose of clopidogrel as part of both conservative and invasive strategies for the management of acute coronary syndromes (ACS). In a small randomized trial in patients with non-ST-segment elevation ACS, pretreatment with clopidogrel 600 mg > 12 hours before coronary stenting was associated with significantly fewer major adverse cardiovascular events compared with pretreatment with clopidogrel 300 mg (P = 0.020). A randomized trial in patients with ACS undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) reported a significant reduction in ischemic risk with prasugrel (60-mg loading dose, 10-mg/d maintenance dose) compared with clopidogrel (300-mg loading dose, 75-mg/d maintenance dose) (P < 0.001); however, the clinical benefit with prasugrel was accompanied by a significant increase in the risk of life-threatening bleeding (P = 0.01). Pretreatment with a 300-mg clopidogrel loading dose administered at least 15 hours before elective PCI was associated with a significant reduction in periprocedural ischemic events compared with 75 mg given after PCI (P = 0.028). In another randomized trial in patients undergoing elective PCI, pretreatment with clopidogrel 600 mg before diagnostic catheterization was associated with a significantly increased risk of minor bleeding complications (P = 0.027) without a significant benefit in terms of the primary ischemic end point. Data from registries support the use of a 300-mg loading dose of clopidogrel for the standard care of patients with ACS and indicate no significant benefit for pretreatment with loading doses > 300 mg. One study of registry data found that pretreatment with clopidogrel 300 mg before elective PCI was associated with a significant reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events compared with a loading dose given immediately before or after the intervention (P = 0.002).

Conclusions

Suppression of platelet activity through the use of antithrombotic agents should be balanced against the risk of atherothrombotic events. In patients with ACS, inhibition of platelet activation beyond that produced by clopidogrel 600 mg has been associated with an increased bleeding risk. In patients undergoing elective PCI, pretreatment with clopidogrel 300 mg administered > 15 hours before the procedure achieved the optimal risk-benefit ratio. In cases of unplanned PCI, administration of clopidogrel 600 mg immediately after diagnostic catheterization was well tolerated and effective.

### Effectiveness of in-laboratory high-dose clopidogrel loading versus routine pre-load in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention: results of the ARMYDA-5 PRELOAD (antiplatelet therapy for reduction of MYocardial damage during angioplasty) randomized trial [^113bfpht]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

Objectives

This study sought to evaluate safety and effectiveness of in-laboratory (in-lab) 600-mg clopidogrel loading pre-percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) versus routine 6-h pre-load.

Background

Clopidogrel pre-treatment significantly improves outcome in patients undergoing PCI; however, efficacy of an in-lab loading strategy before PCI after coronary angiography versus routine pre-load has not been fully characterized.

Methods

A total of 409 patients (39% with acute coronary syndrome) were randomized to receive a 600-mg clopidogrel loading dose 4 to 8 h before PCI (pre-load group, n = 204) or a 600-mg loading dose given in the catheterization lab after coronary angiography, but prior to PCI (in-lab group, n = 205). Primary end point was 30-day incidence of major adverse cardiac events: cardiac death, myocardial infarction (MI), or unplanned target vessel revascularization.

Results

There was no significant difference in primary end point between the 2 randomization arms (8.8% in-lab vs. 10.3% pre-load; p = 0.72); this was mainly driven by periprocedural MI (8.8% vs. 9.3%, p = 0.99). No increased risk of bleeding or vascular complications was observed in the pre-load arm (5.4% vs. 7.8%; p = 0.42). As determined by the VerifyNow assay (Accumetrics, San Diego, California), patients in the in-lab group showed higher platelet reactivity during PCI and 2 h after intervention versus those in the pre-load arm (p ≤ 0.043).

Conclusions

ARMYDA-5 PRELOAD (Antiplatelet therapy for Reduction of MYocardial Damage during Angioplasty) trial indicates that a strategy of 600-mg in-lab clopidogrel load pre-PCI may have similar clinical outcomes as routine 4- to 8-h pre-load. Thus, when indicated, in-lab clopidogrel administration can be a safe alternative to routine pre-treatment given before knowing patients' coronary anatomy.

### Selection of P2YInhibitor in percutaneous coronary intervention and / or acute coronary syndrome [^117WS3Y2]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

The P2Y 12 receptor plays a critical role in the amplification of platelet aggregation in response to various agonists and stable thrombus generation at the site of vascular injury leading to deleterious ischemic complications. Therefore, treatment with a P2Y 12 receptor blocker is a major effective strategy to prevent ischemic complications in high-risk patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The determination of optimal platelet inhibition is based on maximizing antithrombotic properties while minimizing bleeding risk and is critically dependent on individual patient's propensity for thrombotic and bleeding risks. Immediately after ACS and during PCI, where highly elevated thrombotic activity is present, a loading dose administration with a potent P2Y 12 receptor blocker such as ticagrelor or prasugrel is preferred. In stable coronary artery disease patients undergoing PCI, clopidogrel is widely used. In addition, in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infraction who cannot take oral medications, a fast acting intravenous glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor or P2Y 12 receptor blocker, cangrelor, may add clinical benefits. During long term therapy, a strategy that prevents ischemic risk while avoiding excessive bleeding risk is similarly desired. Although up to one year dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) is recommended in patients undergoing elective stenting, the available data support the anti-ischemic benefit of prolonged DAPT (more than1 year) in patients with prior MI. In addition to the DAPT risk calculator tool, future risk assessment methods that analyze intrinsic thrombogenicity and atherosclerotic coronary burden may further identify the optimal candidate for prolonged DAPT to improve net clinical outcomes.

### Clopidogrel pre-treatment in stable angina: for all patients > 6 h before elective coronary angiography or only for angiographically selected patients a few minutes before PCI? A randomized multicentre trial PRAGUE-8 [^116mA7QN]. European Heart Journal (2008). Low credibility.

Aims

To compare two different clopidogrel regimens on the outcomes of patients undergoing elective coronary angiography (CAG) ± ad hoc percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).

Methods and Results

Open-trial randomized 1028 patients with stable angina to group A ('non-selective'-clopidogrel 600 mg > 6 h before CAG; n = 513) or group B ('selective'-clopidogrel 600 mg in the cath-lab after CAG, only in case of PCI; n = 515). Combined primary endpoint was death/periprocedural myocardial infarction (MI)/stroke/re-intervention within 7 days. Secondary endpoints were troponin elevation and bleeding complications. Primary endpoint occurred in 0.8% group A patients vs. 1% group B (P = 0.749; 90% CI for the percentage difference -1.2–0.8). Periprocedural troponin elevation (> 3 x ULN) was detected in 2.6% group A vs. 3.3% group B (P = 0.475; 90% CI -2.5–1.0). Bleeding complications occurred in 3.5% group A patients vs. 1.4% group B (P = 0.025). After adjustment for covariates and factors that may influence the bleeding risk, patients in group A were shown to have more likely bleeding complications when compared with group B (OR = 3.03; 95% CI 1.14–8.10; P = 0.027).

Conclusion

High (600 mg) loading dose of clopidogrel before elective CAG increased the risk of minor bleeding complications, while the benefit on periprocedural infarction was not significant. Clopidogrel can be given safely in the catheterization laboratory between CAG and PCI in chronic stable angina patients.

### Extended duration of dual-antiplatelet therapy after percutaneous coronary intervention: how long is too long? [^112QSaUz]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Table 2
Clinical Characteristics Benefiting From Extended‐Duration DAPT

In summary, prolonged DAPT appears more beneficial in patients with ACS treated with ticagrelor or prasugrel, with risk factors for recurrent ischemia at a cost of increased bleeding. However, any clinician will also recognize that not all bleeding or ACS events carry the same risk. Indeed, a clinician‐patient shared decision making seems apt when discussing the optimal duration of DAPT. On the other hand, the clinician must also remember that trials evaluating DAPT over 5 years are currently lacking. Therefore, although possibly beneficial, any DAPT beyond this time period has no strong clinical evidence. With the continuous medication and stent advances, the optimal DAPT duration will likely be altered, but until then the current guidelines supporting DAPT duration of 12 months in ACS with further tailoring of therapy based on an individual risk of further ischemic or bleeding events provide an excellent framework to begin. Evolving research will help us further understand the risks and benefits of extended‐duration DAPT, especially with the newer‐generation stents.

### To pretreat or not to pretreat (with oral P2Y12 antagonists)? That is the question [^114VrvQo]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

The treatment of patients presenting with non‐ST‐segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) continues to evolve. As advancing technical capabilities in the cardiac catheterization lab have expanded percutaneous revascularization options, medical treatments have also continued to progress, offering ongoing improvements in outcomes. The 2014 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology guidelines reflect the importance of medical management, including platelet inhibition, and recommend treatment with both aspirin and a P2Y12 receptor inhibitor, either clopidogrel or ticagrelor, before coronary angiography and possible percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). 1 However, because of the increased risk of bleeding, the guidelines also recommend subsequent discontinuation of the P2Y12 inhibitor 5 to 7 days before coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) if surgical revascularization therapy is pursued. The management of antiplatelet therapy in patients with NSTEMI continues to change as further data are obtained regarding the optimal management of these patients.

### Coronary artery revascularization in the older adult population: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^111SrAxb]. Circulation (2025). High credibility.

Coronary artery revascularization in older adults — antiplatelet therapy and PCI: Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with aspirin plus an oral P2Y12 inhibitor is described as the mainstay to prevent thrombotic events in older patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). For patients with SIHD undergoing PCI, guidelines provide a Class 1 recommendation for clopidogrel in addition to aspirin regardless of age, and they state that evidence does not support routine pretreatment before angiography. In acute coronary syndrome (ACS), a PLATO substudy found that in patients ≥ 75 years of age versus those < 75 years of age, the clinical benefit and overall safety of ticagrelor versus clopidogrel was not significantly different, with approximately 73% of patients ≥ 75 years of age undergoing PCI. The POPular AGE trial randomized patients ≥ 70 years of age with NSTE-ACS and showed significantly fewer bleeding events with clopidogrel without an increase in the composite ischemic end point; in this trial, > 50% of patients underwent PCI with no interaction observed. Guidelines suggest cautious use of prasugrel in patients ≥ 75 years of age based on TRITON, which used a 10-mg maintenance dose and showed no net clinical benefit versus clopidogrel in patients ≥ 75 years of age due to higher bleeding; more recent studies evaluated a 5-mg maintenance dose, and in Elderly ACS 2 (ACS ≥ 74 years), 5 mg daily of prasugrel versus clopidogrel showed no significant differences in the primary composite ischemic end point, with major bleeding numerically higher and the trial stopped early for futility. In patients with atrial fibrillation undergoing PCI, dual therapy with a direct oral anticoagulant plus clopidogrel is generally preferred over triple therapy in older adults and reduces bleeding without a significant increase in thrombotic complications. Guidelines do not recommend the routine use of intravenous platelet inhibitors during PCI.

### Challenges of long-term dual antiplatelet therapy use following acute coronary syndromes [^1117Z6DN]. American Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

An acute coronary syndrome (ACS) event is associated with a high risk of recurrent ACS, stroke, and death. To ameliorate the risk of subsequent events, current guidelines for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction and non-ST-segment elevation ACS recommend long-term management strategies for secondary prevention including risk factor modification and anti-ischemic and antiplatelet therapies. Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT), comprising aspirin plus a P2Y 12 inhibitor, is a critical component of secondary prevention therapy following ACS. However, despite the importance of DAPT for secondary prevention after ACS, questions remain over the optimal duration of therapy. Clinical evidence is emerging that maintenance DAPT > 12 months lowers the risk of recurrent ACS events; however, this benefit must be considered against any potential risks of prolonged DAPT such as bleeding. Several tools for bleeding risk assessment have shown promise; however, their limited accuracy and discriminative power necessitates further development. Assessment of patient ischemic risk should consider the complexity of the percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) procedure, anatomic burden of coronary artery disease, and additional underlying risk factors. Consequently, identifying patients in whom the risk:benefit ratio favors prolonged DAPT may prove invaluable for clinicians in deciding which patients should continue or stop taking DAPT at 12 months after PCI, or consider P2Y 12 inhibitor monotherapy as an option. This article reviews the most recent information about the risks and benefits of DAPT continued for > 12 months after ACS and provides critical guidance to assist physicians in identifying patients most likely to benefit from a secondary prevention strategy with DAPT.

### Dual antiplatelet therapy for secondary prevention of coronary artery disease [^1153gbF9]. Open Heart (2017). Low credibility.

Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) combining aspirin and a P2Y 12 receptor inhibitor has been consistently shown to reduce recurrent major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for stable coronary artery disease (CAD) compared with aspirin monotherapy, but at the expense of an increased risk of major bleeding. Nevertheless, the optimal duration of DAPT for secondary prevention of CAD remains uncertain, owing to the conflicting results of several large randomised trials. Among patients with stable CAD undergoing PCI with drug-eluting stents (DES), shorter durations of DAPT (3–6 months) were shown non-inferior to 12 or 24 months duration with respect to MACE, but reduced the rates of major bleeding. Contrariwise, prolonged DAPT durations (18–48 months) reduced the incidence of myocardial infarction and stent thrombosis, but at a cost of an increased risk of major bleeding and all-cause mortality. Until more evidence becomes available, the choice of optimal DAPT regimen and duration for patients with CAD requires a tailored approach based on the patient clinical presentation, baseline risk profile and management strategy. Future studies are however needed to identify patients who may derive benefit from shortened or extended DAPT courses for secondary prevention of CAD based on their individual ischaemic and bleeding risk. Based on limited evidence, 12 months duration of DAPT is currently recommended in patients with ACS irrespective of their management strategy, but large ongoing randomised trials are currently assessing the efficacy and safety of a short-term DAPT strategy (3–6 months) for patients with ACS undergoing PCI with newer generation DES. Finally, several ongoing, large-scale, randomised trials are challenging the current concept of DAPT by investigating P2Y 12 receptor inhibitors as single antiplatelet therapy and may potentially shift the paradigm of antiplatelet therapy after PCI in the near future. This article provides a contemporary state-of-the-art review of the current evidence on DAPT for secondary prevention of patients with CAD and its future perspectives.

### Clopidogrel pre-treatment in stable angina: for all patients > 6 h before elective coronary angiography or only for angiographically selected patients a few minutes before PCI? A randomized multicentre trial PRAGUE-8 [^111ojVRv]. European Heart Journal (2008). Low credibility.

Study limitations

This was a randomized comparison of two unapproved (but routinely used in many centres worldwide) regimens of loading dose of clopidogrel for PCI in stable angina. The approved loading dose is 300 mg. The habit of giving a 600 mg loading dose pre-PCI or at the time of PCI has spread among interventional cardiologists, but without any clear evidence of its efficacy and safety. It could be possible that a 300 or 600 mg loading dose administered long before angiography/PCI would probably not have much difference on inhibition of platelet aggregation at the time of PCI, but the impact on bleeding risk could be greater with 600 mg than with 300 mg.

This study was not designed to examine whether clopidogrel should be used before PCI (we believe that the answer is yes). This trial was designed to test the use of high dose clopidogrel before elective CAG. We believe that there is a substantial overlap in literature between the terms 'elective PCI' and 'elective CAG ± possible PCI'. We firmly believe that terminology should be unified in this field as follows: Planned elective PCI, scheduled PCI procedure in a patient with already known CAG result (i.e. PCI done as a separate procedure from CAG). Ad hoc PCI represents PCI procedure performed immediately following CAG. Planned elective CAG represents scheduled CAG procedure in a patient with clinical presentation of various forms of coronary artery disease. In other words, the term 'planned elective PCI' should not be used for patients without known CAG result.

Conclusions

High dose clopidogrel before elective CAG increased the risk of bleeding complications while the effect on the primary ischaemic endpoint was not significant. Clopidogrel can be administered safely in the catheterization laboratory between CAG and PCI in patients with chronic stable angina. We suppose that clopidogrel should be used before 'planned elective PCI' as well as before ' ad hoc PCI', but not before 'planned elective CAG'.

### 2021 ACC expert consensus decision pathway on same-day discharge after percutaneous coronary intervention: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^1136dcVz]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2021). High credibility.

Post-percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) same-day discharge (SDD) checklist — post-PCI dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) management must be prioritized, as "The importance of adequate DAPT involving P2Y12i must be at the forefront of the checklist from a preprocedural and postprocedural vantage". Practice varies in timing of P2Y12 inhibitor (P2Y12i) loading, with initiation "either days before the procedure, while in the pre-procedural area, or while in the cardiac catheterization laboratory after defining the coronary anatomy", yet "all instances of PCI guideline-directed loading and maintenance of DAPT provide optimum results and decrease the incidence of stent thrombosis". For safe SDD, "Orders for outpatient loading and maintenance or preprocedural DAPT loading should be confirmed in the EHR and communicated between preprocedural and procedural nursing and then verbally to the patient", and "Once ordered, the procedural loading should be communicated to postprocedural staff and then administered to the patient". If starting a new P2Y12i for SDD, "a prescription to the facility's outpatient pharmacy should be expedited" and "a prescription should also be sent to the patient's preferred outpatient pharmacy", and "the EHR should also confirm prescriptions for aspirin and statin therapy as well as a referral to cardiac rehabilitation".

Long-term use of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) after myocardial infarction (MI) — Activation of platelets with resultant thrombosis occurs not only after drug-eluting stent (DES) implantation but also as part of atherosclerosis, patients with a recent atherothrombotic coronary event are at high risk of recurrent events, several trials have shown DAPT reduces recurrent MI in the year after an acute MI, and "current guidelines recommend that DAPT should be continued for up to 12 months after MI". Findings from analyses highlight the potential benefit of DAPT among patients with high atherothrombotic risk.

### Critical appraisal of guidelines for coronary artery disease on dual antiplatelet therapy: more consensus than controversies [^115qxvKc]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

It is generally believed that appropriate use of high‐quality guidelines can improve patient outcomes. 3, 31 In Komajda et al's study, 33 physician's guideline adherence is associated with better prognosis among outpatients, which emphasizes the importance of guideline‐directed medical therapy. As a result, it is of great significance to improve the defects found in this assessment.

With respect to the recommendations, most guidelines reached general consensus, though discrepancies still existed, particularly in DAPT duration. For recommendations on SCAD patients managed with BMS implantation, 2016 AHA ACC and 2012 JCS came to an agreement on 1 month while 2019 ESC, 2018 ESC, 2017 ESC1 recommended 6 months. We critically reviewed the evidences presented by the guidelines. 34, 35, 36, 37 Although they provided high quality evidences for the appropriate use of DAPT for 1 month or 6 months separately, no dedicated studies comparing these two durations for SCAD patients undergoing PCI were present. As a result, more evidences are needed. In addition, 2012 JCS (with relatively low scores) did not provided any evidence so more information should be presented. For patients with implantation of DES, four strongly recommended guidelines 2019 ESC, 2018 ESC, 2017 ESC1, and 2016 AHA ACC unanimously recommended 6 months and presented high quality evidence. On the contrary, 2012 JCS recommended 1 month without citing any evidence, which may be unreliable. What is more, 2018 CCS should represent clearly in terms of the stent type for the subsequent strategy may be different.

Although there are differences between NSTE‐ACS and STE‐ACS in pathophysiology, the recommendations on DAPT are similar, which may due to the study design of their relevant evidences. For NSTE‐ACS or STE‐ACS patients treated with PCI, the recommendations for DAPT initial timing are controversial. Nearly half of guidelines suggested pretreatment before PCI while half of guidelines did not mention. However, in the explanatory section, guidelines all expressed that, due to the lacking of evidence, whether patients undergoing PCI should be pretreated is stilled debated. 13, 14, 19, 21, 25 As a result, more evidences are needed to generate the strategy. As for DAPT duration, most guidelines came to an agreement of 12 months as the standard duration. Tendency could be seen from Table 2 that recently published guidelines tended to provide individual duration adjustment for patients with different bleeding or ischemic risk, although there were still some inconsistencies.

1.3.2 Post revascularization

Multiple trials have studied the optimal duration for antiplatelet therapy after revascularization. A meta‐analysis of randomized controlled trials with a cohort of 31 666 patients indicated that a shorter DAPT duration could be associated with a reduction in all‐cause mortality. Patients who received DAPT for 6 months or less exhibited mortality, MI, and stent thrombosis rates comparable to those treated for 1 year, yet they experienced less significant bleeding.

The 2023 CCD Guidelines provide recommendations for patients undergoing PCI with and without the need for OAC therapy for another indication. In individuals undergoing PCI for CCD who do not require OAC, DAPT is recommended for at least 6 months postprocedure, transitioning thereafter to an SAPT. Conversely, for those who need OAC therapy post‐PCI, a 1–4‐week course of DAPT plus DOAC is suggested, followed by a 6‐month period of clopidogrel with DOAC to balance the prevention of thrombotic events with the minimization of bleeding risks.

A shorter DAPT period of 1–3 months followed by P2Y12 inhibitor monotherapy extending to a year, may be appropriate for patients with a lower risk of thrombotic events (COR2a). This is supported by the ULTIMATE‐DAPT trial, a placebo‐controlled, randomized trial involving 3400 patients undergoing PCI for ACS, which showed that compared with standard 12‐month DAPT comprising aspirin and ticagrelor, 1‐month DAPT followed by de‐escalation to ticagrelor monotherapy reduces clinically relevant bleeding without increasing thrombotic risk at 1 year. Bleeding Academic Research Consortium (BARC) levels 2, 3, or 5 at 1 year occurred in 4.6% of patients continuing DAPT and 2.1% of patients on ticagrelor monotherapy (hazard ratio [HR], 0.45; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.30–0.66; p < .0001).

Conversely, for selected patients with a lower risk of bleeding and a history of MI, prolonging DAPT for up to 3 years beyond the initial year may be beneficial in lowering the recurrence of MACE (COR2b). Notably, in the prevention of cardiovascular events in patients with prior heart attack Using Ticagrelor Compared to Placebo on a Background of Aspirin–Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 54 (PEGASUS‐TIMI 54) trial, the addition of ticagrelor (ticagrelor 60 mg BID) to low‐dose aspirin in patients 1–3 years after MI, significantly reduced the risk of cardiovascular death, MI, or stroke.

### To pretreat or not to pretreat (with oral P2Y12 antagonists)? That is the question [^1154TLHZ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Large bodies of data all show the benefit of treatment with dual antiplatelet therapy including aspirin and a P2Y12 receptor inhibitor. Although the landscape of treatment with P2Y12 medications has evolved, the processes of care in the diagnosis and treatment of patients with NSTEMI have also progressed. At the time that the CURE trial was completed, patients underwent PCI at a median of 10 days following presentation and frequently did not have PCI until a second hospital stay, when the acute event was resolved. This is in stark contrast to current management and more‐recent studies in which patients underwent coronary angiography largely within 48 hours. These changes in clinical practice may underlie discordance in results among studies examining outcomes among patients treated with P2Y12 therapy before coronary angiography. Whereas a substudy of the CURE trial showed benefit among patients pretreated with clopidogrel before coronary angiography, the small, randomized ARMYDA‐5 (Antiplatelet Therapy for Reduction of Myocardial Damage During Angioplasty‐5) PRELOAD and PRAGUE‐8 (PRimary Angioplasty in patients transferred from General community hospitals to specialized PTCA Units with or without Emergency thrombolysis‐8) trials showed no benefit. 5, 12, 13 The ACCOAST (Comparison of Prasugrel at the Time of Percutaneous Coronary Intervention or as Pretreatment at the Time of Diagnosis in Patients with Non‐ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction) trial similarly showed no benefit in pretreatment with prasugrel.

### Critical appraisal of guidelines for coronary artery disease on dual antiplatelet therapy: more consensus than controversies [^112ePyT7]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Twelve guidelines provided recommendations for patients with non‐ST‐elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE‐ACS). Four guidelines (2018 ESC, 2016 NHFA/CSANZA, 2015 AHA ACC, 2012 AHA ACCF1) recommended DAPT before PCI and 2017 ESC1 recommended pretreatment in patients in whom coronary anatomy is known and the decision to proceed to PCI is made. However, other seven guidelines did not mention about pretreatment. For P 2 Y 12 inhibitor selection, most guidelines tended to favor ticagrelor or prasugrel over clopidogrel as an adjunct to aspirin. Most guidelines reached a consensus of 12 months as a standard treatment while 2018 JCS suggested 6 to 12 months. Half of the guidelines provide recommendations for patients with high bleeding risk. Among this, three guidelines (2018 ESC, 2017 ESC1, 2016 AHA ACC) suggested discontinuing at 6 months, two guidelines (2016 NHFA/CSANZ, 2012 AHA ACCF1) suggested discontinuing before 12 months, one guideline (2015 ESC) suggested 3 to 6 months, one guideline (2018 JCS) suggested 3 months while 2018 CCS suggested discontinuing at 12 months. For patients with high ischemic risk, six guidelines (2018 ESC, 2017 ESC1, 2015 ESC, 2016 NHFA/CSANZ, 2018 JCS, 2018 TSC) considered continuing for longer than 12 months (Table 2).

Eleven guidelines suggested recommendations for patients with ST‐elevation ACS. For DAPT initial timing, half of the guidelines (2018 ESC, 2017 ESC1, 2017 ESC2, 2016 NHFA/CSANZ, 2013 AHA ACCF) recommended pretreatment before PCI while other guidelines (2016 AHA ACC, 2011 AHA ACCF, 2018 CCS, 2013 NICE1, 2013 NICE2) did not mention about. In addition, recommendations for P 2 Y 12 inhibitor selection or DAPT duration were similar to that for NSTE‐ACS (Table 2).

3.6 Recommendations for DAPT in patients treated with medical therapy

Only two guidelines (2011 AHA ACCF, 2012 AHA ACCF2) mentioned DAPT in patients with medically managed SCAD. Both of them recommended aspirin plus clopidogrel without clear duration. Six guidelines recommended DAPT in patients with ACS receiving medical therapy. Most guidelines recommended ticagrelor or clopidogrel plus aspirin for 12 months as a standard treatment. Three guidelines provided suggestions for duration adjustment on grounds of high ischemic or bleeding risk, which basically reached a consensus.

Table 7 — dosing considerations for oral antiplatelet therapy in acute coronary syndromes (ACS) summarizes agent- and dose-specific details as follows: Aspirin lists "Loading dose 162–325 mg orally" with nonenteric-coated tablets chewed when possible and "Maintenance dose 75–100 mg orally daily (nonenteric coated)", with a loading dose also for those already on aspirin. Clopidogrel lists "Loading dose 300 or 600 mg orally" and "Maintenance 75 mg orally daily"; for STEMI with fibrinolytic, dosing is "Loading dose 300 mg orally if age ≤ 75 y; Initial dose 75 mg orally if age > 75 y", followed by "Maintenance 75 mg orally daily". Prasugrel for patients "undergoing PCI" provides "Loading dose 60 mg orally", "Maintenance dose 10 mg orally daily if body weight ≥ 60 kg and age < 75 y", or "Maintenance dose 5 mg orally daily if body weight < 60 kg or age ≥ 75 y (use caution)". Ticagrelor lists "Loading dose 180 mg orally" and "Maintenance dose 90 mg orally twice daily".

Elective PCI — discharge options and observation emphasize that patients undergoing elective PCI may either be discharged home (SDD) or observed overnight. Studies have shown that a 4- to 6-hour post-PCI observation period is typically sufficient to identify most potential complications. Thus, if the "three P's" can be met on the same calendar day as the procedure, then the patient may be eligible for SDD. Checklists can help ensure milestones, and a handout should include medication details such as duration of dual‑antiplatelet therapy (DAPT), contact numbers, and postprocedure follow-up; it is essential to coordinate with pharmacy and provide medication education and DAPT prior to discharge.

### Clopidogrel vs DAPT in acute coronary syndromes and high ischemic / bleeding risk… [^111qPtiz]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

dual antiplatelet therapy in patients at increased ischemic risk, such as those with ACS. 1–5 Conversely, patients at increased bleeding risk warrant less intensive therapy. 1–5 In real-world practice, many patients are at increased risk for both ischemic and bleeding events; the optimal antithrombotic treatment regimen in such patients is unknown.
6. Patients who completed at least 9 months and no more than 12 months of DAPT after drug-eluting stent implantation for the treatment of ACS, who were free from major adverse clinical events during the prior 6 months, were eligible for enrollment.

In brief, patients with ACS were qualified as meeting criteria for both high ischemic and bleeding risk if 1 of the following 3 conditions were met: any patient 75 years or older, patients aged 65 to 75 years who also met at least 1 additional criterion of ischemic or bleeding risk, or patients 65 years or younger who met at least additional 1 criterion of ischemic risk and at least 1 additional criterion of bleeding risk. The standard DAPT course was allowed to range as short as 9 months and as long as 12 months before randomization because of the presence of criteria for both high bleeding as well as ischemic risk. Participant race and ethnicity data were not gathered as this study was conducted in domestic Chinese centers, where the vast majority of patients were East Asians.

The present trial enrolled a unique difficult-to-treat patient population with criteria for not only increased ischemic risk but also increased bleeding risk who were maintained on standard DAPT by their treating physicians for at least 9 months and not more than 12 months before randomization without major adverse events. This time point was considered ideal to test our study hypothesis given the time-dependent risk of ischemia and bleeding after PCI in ACS, 22 and the relatively high rate of DAPT discontinuation in patients with ACS at 9 to 12 months after PCI in older adult patients in China. 23 Moreover, although contemporary guidelines recommend.

Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) after stent implantation — guideline recommendations and P2Y12 options: The 2011 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) guideline "recommended a minimum DAPT duration of at least 12 months after drug-eluting stents (DES) implantation, irrespective of clinical presentation". The duration "should generally be as follows": for patients receiving a stent during PCI for acute coronary syndrome, "P2Y12 inhibitor therapy should be given for at least 12 months. Options include clopidogrel 75 mg daily, prasugrel 10 mg daily, and ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily. (Class I, Level of Evidence: B)". For DES placed for a non–acute coronary syndrome indication, "clopidogrel 75 mg daily should be given for at least 12 months if patients are not at high risk of bleeding.

### Dual antiplatelet therapy for long-term secondary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular events [^111ZVLvL]. Clinical Therapeutics (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with aspirin and a P2Y 12 inhibitor is currently recommended to prevent further ischemic events after percutaneous coronary intervention and acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Guidelines currently recommend a minimum of 6 months after elective drug-eluting stent placement and at least 12 months of DAPT after ACS; however, the benefits of prolonged treatment are unclear. The purpose of this review was to conduct a detailed examination of the data refuting or supporting the use of DAPT beyond 1 year in patients with ACS and in patients receiving percutaneous coronary intervention with stenting.

Methods

A search of PubMed was performed to identify articles published in the last 20 years that addressed the role of DAPT beyond 12 months' duration.

Findings

A number of studies have shown ischemic benefits associated with prolonging DAPT beyond 12 months, but this finding is dependent on the patient population studied and the quality of the study design. Many studies also show that longer duration therapy has been associated with increased bleeding risk. In patients with previous myocardial infarction completing at least 1 year of DAPT, continuing DAPT with a reduced dose of ticagrelor 60 mg BID is a regimen to be considered for these patients; in general ACS patients, a reduced dose of 60 mg BID of ticagrelor after the first year of DAPT should be considered; and in the post-percutaneous coronary intervention patients, DAPT beyond 1 year should be considered after careful evaluation of the patient's thrombotic and bleeding risks.

Implications

The duration of DAPT, and the choice of P2Y 12 inhibitor, should be tailored to the individual patient. To optimize patient outcomes, the benefits and risks associated with prolonging DAPT need to be evaluated, considering comorbidities and the presence of bleeding and ischemic risk factors. Despite some limitations, risk scores, such as the DAPT score, are available to help guide decisions for the best approach for each patient.

### Periprocedural outcomes according to timing of clopidogrel loading dose in patients who did not receive P2YInhibitor pretreatment [^113vmDsY]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Interventions (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

In patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), who did not receive P2Y 12 inhibitor pretreatment, the optimal timing of P2Y 12 inhibitor loading dose remains debated. We sought to examine whether the choice of administration of the clopidogrel loading dose before or after the start of PCI had an impact on periprocedural complications, including bleeding.

Methods and Results

The CHAMPION PHOENIX (A Clinical Trial Comparing Cangrelor to Clopidogrel Standard Therapy in Subjects Who Require Percutaneous Coronary Intervention) double-blind randomized trial compared cangrelor with clopidogrel loading dose at the time of PCI. Pretreatment with clopidogrel before randomization was not permitted per protocol. In the clopidogrel-only group (n = 5438), a loading dose was given before (early load [EL]) or after the start of PCI (late load [LL]) according to physician choice. Overall, 3442 (63.3%) patients had EL and 1997 LL (36.7%). Median times were 5 minutes before and 20 minutes after the start of PCI, respectively. EL was more frequently used among patients with ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction (84.4%) and non-ST-segment-elevation acute coronary syndromes (71.5%) than in stable patients (53.7%). At 48 hours, rates of the primary outcome of death, myocardial infarction, ischemia-driven revascularization, or stent thrombosis were similar (6.0% versus 5.4%) for EL versus LL, respectively (odds ratio [OR], 1.11 [95% CI, 0.87–1.41]; P = 0.41), and remained so after adjustment for potential confounders, including clinical presentation (OR [95% CI], 1.39 [0.90–2.15]; P = 0.14). Compared with clopidogrel, cangrelor consistently reduced the primary outcome in both EL (4.8% versus 6.0%; OR [95% CI], 0.80 [0.64–0.98]) and LL (4.3% versus 5.4%; OR [95% CI], 0.79 [0.59–1.06]; interaction P = 0.99). Global Use of Strategies to Open Occluded Coronary Arteries severe/moderate bleeding rates were similar between treatment arms for both EL (OR [95% CI], 1.24 [0.58–2.66]) and LL (OR [95% CI], 2.53 [0.98–6.54]; interaction P = 0.25).

Conclusions

In a nonrandomized comparison of patients with clopidogrel loading before or after the start of PCI, the rates of periprocedural PCI complications, including bleeding, were similar, as were the benefits of cangrelor, regardless of the timing.

Elinogrel — mechanism and early clinical evaluation: Elinogrel is a reversible P2Y12 inhibitor available in IV and oral formulations; it competitively inhibits P2Y12 and blocks adenosine diphosphate (ADP) binding, with inhibition overcome at higher ADP concentrations. In the ERASE MI dose-escalation study, a single IV bolus of 10, 20, 40, or 60 mg before diagnostic angiography for primary PCI in 70 ST-elevation MI patients was compared with placebo; all patients also received clopidogrel loading doses of 600 mg then 300 mg 4 h postprocedure. Major bleeding was infrequent and similar to placebo; the trial was stopped early and later studies used oral elinogrel after the initial IV bolus.

### Pharmacology before, during and after percutaneous coronary intervention [^111rJEJT]. Heart (2020). Medium credibility.

Non ST elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS)

Data from PCI-CURE showed benefit of pretreatment with clopidogrel and aspirin in NSTE-ACSboth before and after PCI, even though the median time from randomisation to PCI was 10 days — in contrast to contemporary recommendation for early referral and invasive management (within 48 hours). Subsequent studies in NSTE-ACS were equivocalshowing no benefit of clopidogrel pretreatment. A non-randomised study of clopidogrel pretreatment (300 mg loading ≥ 12 hours or a 600 mg loading ≥ 2 hours before angiography) was associated with similar adjusted short-term ischaemic and bleeding outcomes compared with in-laboratory 600 mg clopidogrel loading (< 2 hours before or after PCI). Overall, in the setting of early invasive therapy, the evidence supporting pretreatment with clopidogrel in NSTE-ACS is limited.

Pretreatment with ticagrelor against in-laboratory treatment has not been tested. In PLATO, treatment before coronary angiography was permitted and did not exclude patients pretreated with clopidogrel before randomisation. Study analysis showed pretreatment to be safe but without ischaemia reduction.

The only randomised study of pretreatment in this population was the ACCOAST study which tested half-dose prasugrel (30 mg) followed by a second in-laboratory 30 mg dose compared with 60 mg before PCI, after coronary anatomy had been defined. The results showed no benefit of pretreatment in the ischaemic endpoint but a 90% increased risk of major and life-threatening bleeding. In the PCI subgroup, there was also no evidence of ischaemic benefit. The ACTION group meta-analysis also failed to show a significant mortality reduction with pretreatment with increased major bleeding.

Circulation (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The optimal duration of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) after implantation of newer-generation drug-eluting stents (DES) remains uncertain. Similarly, questions remain about the role of DAPT in long-term therapy of stable post-myocardial infarction (MI) patients.

Aim

Our objective was to compare the incidence of death, major hemorrhage, MI, stent thrombosis, and major adverse cardiac events in patients randomized to prolonged or short-course DAPT after implantation of newer-generation DES and in secondary prevention after MI.

Methods

We used traditional frequentist statistical and Bayesian approaches to address the following questions: Q1) What is the minimum duration of DAPT required after DES implantation? Q2) What is the clinical benefit of prolonging DAPT up to 18 to 48 months? Q3) What is the clinical effect of DAPT in stable patients who are > 1 year past an MI?

Results

We reviewed evidence from 11 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that enrolled 33051 patients who received predominantly newer-generation DES to answer: A1) Use of DAPT for 12 months, as compared with use for 3 to 6 months, resulted in no significant differences in incidence of death (odds ratio [OR]: 1.17; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.85 to 1.63), major hemorrhage (OR: 1.65; 95% CI: 0.97 to 2.82), MI (OR: 0.87; 95% CI: 0.65 to 1.18), or stent thrombosis (OR: 0.87; 95% CI: 0.49 to 1.55). Bayesian models confirmed the primary analysis. A2) Use of DAPT for 18 to 48 months, compared with use for 6 to 12 months, was associated with no difference in incidence of all-cause death (OR: 1.14; 95% CI: 0.92 to 1.42) but was associated with increased major hemorrhage (OR: 1.58; 95% CI: 1.20 to 2.09), decreased MI (OR: 0.67; 95% CI: 0.47 to 0.95), and decreased stent thrombosis (OR: 0.45; 95% CI: 0.24 to 0.74). A risk-benefit analysis found 3 fewer stent thromboses (95% CI: 2 to 5) and 6 fewer MIs (95% CI: 2 to 11) but 5 more major bleeds (95% CI: 3 to 9) per 1000 patients treated with prolonged DAPT per year. Post hoc analyses provided weak evidence of increased mortality with prolonged DAPT. We reviewed evidence from 1 RCT of 21162 patients and a post hoc analysis of 1 RCT of 15603 patients to answer: A3): Use of DAPT > 1 year after MI reduced the composite risk of cardiovascular death, MI, or stroke (hazard ratio: 0.84; 95% CI: 0.74 to 0.95) but increased major bleeding (hazard ratio: 2.32; 95% CI: 1.68 to 3.21). A meta-analysis and a post hoc analysis of an RCT in patients with stable cardiovascular disease produced similar findings.

Conclusions

The primary analysis provides moderately strong evidence that prolonged DAPT after implantation of newer-generation DES entails a tradeoff between reductions in stent thrombosis and MI and increases in major hemorrhage. Secondary analyses provide weak evidence of increased mortality with prolonged DAPT after DES implantation. In patients whose coronary thrombotic risk was defined by a prior MI rather than by DES implantation, the primary analysis provides moderately strong evidence of reduced cardiovascular events at the expense of increased bleeding.

Clopidogrel dosing around elective PCI — In CREDO, a loading dose of clopidogrel with treatment up to 9 months after elective PCI reduced ischemic events; preloading with a 300-mg dose given > 3 hours before PCI showed a trend toward lower events, and a 600-mg loading dose is associated with a shorter time to platelet inhibition and is the preferred dose; ticagrelor and prasugrel have not been studied for long-term clinical outcomes in stable ischemic heart disease (SIHD) undergoing PCI.

### One-month dual antiplatelet therapy following percutaneous coronary intervention with zotarolimus-eluting stents in high-bleeding-risk patients [^112ea29d]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Interventions (2020). Medium credibility.

Study Procedures

Before the PCI procedure, all patients received a loading dose of aspirin (250–500 mg), and P2Y 12 inhibitor pretreatment was administered according to institutional standard practice. DAPT use was mandatory for 1-month post-index procedure or following a staged procedure (performed within 1 month of the initial procedure), if indicated. Requirements for DAPT included 75 to 100 mg aspirin daily and the standard daily dose of a P2Y 12 inhibitor according to individual product labeling, with 75 mg clopidogrel as the preferred agent. Patients discontinued either aspirin or the P2Y 12 inhibitor at 1 month and thereafter were continued on SAPT. Whether to discontinue aspirin or the P2Y 12 inhibitor was according to investigator discretion. Patients treated with oral anticoagulants (OACs) were permitted to receive SAPT plus OAC from the date of the index procedure onward.

Patients were followed post-procedure at 1 month by clinic visit and then at 2 and 6 months and 1 year by telephone/clinic visit with planned follow-up through 2 years.

DAPT adherence — revascularization choice in multivessel coronary artery disease (CAD): In patients with multivessel CAD amenable to percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) who cannot access, tolerate, or adhere to dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) for the appropriate duration, CABG is reasonable in preference to PCI (COR 2a, LOE B-NR). Premature cessation of DAPT after PCI is associated with stent thrombosis and poor outcomes, including death; therefore, PCI is not favored as the mode of revascularization among patients manifesting risk factors for poor adherence. Stent thrombosis after PCI has death rates as high as 50% for early thrombosis cases, and early DAPT interruption is associated with a relative increase in stent thrombosis rates between 2-fold and > 20-fold; given these risks, CABG is a safe revascularization option in patients who are not likely to be adherent to DAPT.

Trial Procedures

Before PCI, all patients received a loading dose of aspirin (300–325 mg if no prior therapy, 75–325 mg if chronic therapy) and a P2Y12 receptor antagonist. For patients on chronic treatment with clopidogrel, a loading dose of 300 mg was required; for patients receiving prior ticagrelor or prasugrel, a loading dose was allowed but not mandated. In patients with stable angina, loading of the P2Y12 receptor antagonist was permitted immediately after PCI to accommodate the variability in local practices of the timing of loading between participating centers. The choice of P2Y12 receptor antagonist was at the investigator's discretion, but the use of prasugrel was discouraged to minimize the risk of bleeding in elderly patients with HBR.

Anticoagulation with unfractionated heparin, bivalirudin, or low‐molecular‐weight heparin, with or without a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor, was prescribed according to local practice.

After PCI, DAPT was given for 1 month to patients presenting with chronic coronary syndrome. After 30 days, single antiplatelet therapy (SAPT) was given (either aspirin or a P2Y12 inhibitor).

Patients presenting with an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) received DAPT for 1 to 3 months at the investigator's discretion followed by SAPT (a P2Y12 inhibitor).

Patients receiving long‐term oral anticoagulation received either SAPT with clopidogrel, or DAPT (with clopidogrel) for 1 month (triple therapy), followed by SAPT with clopidogrel (75 mg QD) for 6 months in stable patients and 12 months in patients with ACS.

Clinical events were assessed during hospital stay and at 30 days, 3 months (patients with ACS), 6 months, and at 12 months after the index procedure. Events were adjudicated by an independent clinical end points committee.

Europace (2019). High credibility.

Atrial fibrillation undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention — anticoagulation and antiplatelet timing: PCI in patients with stable coronary artery disease (CAD) on ongoing uninterrupted non‑vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant (NOAC) monotherapy is currently not recommended; in patients not on oral anticoagulant but on stable aspirin, clopidogrel may be given either prior to or during PCI with no apparent outcome differences, and given triple therapy (TAT) bleeding risk it may be considered to withhold the additional antiplatelet until PCI is indicated by diagnostic angiography. The time to effective platelet inhibition with oral clopidogrel is approximately 2 to 6 h depending on a 600 vs 300 mg loading dose, while intravenous cangrelor or aspirin has a nearly immediate effect; when oral pretreatment is chosen, pretreatment with both aspirin and clopidogrel should preferably include loading with 300 mg to reduce initial bleeding risk. For intraprocedural unfractionated heparin (UFH), doses as low as 30–50 IU/kg have been shown effective for preventing ischaemic PCI complications and should be preferred to limit bleeding risk.

Conclusions

Our study suggests that a dual loading dose of antiplatelet drugs within 24 hours of first medical contact were associated with increased risk of major bleeding but not with decreased risk of MACE among patients 75 years and older with ACS undergoing PCI. Therefore, clinicians should be cautious about administering a dual loading dose of antiplatelet therapy to patients 75 years and older with ACS undergoing PCI. However, more research is still needed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of dual loading doses of antiplatelet therapy in this population.

### Comparison of higher clopidogrel loading and maintenance dose to standard dose on platelet function and outcomes after percutaneous coronary intervention using drug-eluting stents [^113xm9Ri]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

Adequate antiplatelet therapy is paramount for good clinical outcomes in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The purpose of this study was to determine whether a high-dose regimen of clopidogrel in patients undergoing PCI is superior to standard dosing. A total of 119 patients undergoing PCI were blindly randomized in 2:1 fashion to receive clopidogrel loading 600 mg on the table immediately before PCI and 75 mg 2 times/day for 1 month (high-dose group) versus standard dosing (300 mg loading and 75 mg/day; low-dose group). Platelet aggregation was measured using light transmission aggregometry at baseline, 4 hours, and 30 days. The composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, and target vessel revascularization was studied at 30 days in addition to major and minor bleeding. Baseline characteristics and baseline platelet aggregation were similar in the 2 groups. Percent inhibitions of platelet activity were 41% and 27% in the high-dose group versus 19% and 10% in the low-dose group at 4 hours and 30 days (p = 0.046 and 0.047, respectively). Composite clinical end points were 10.3% in the high-dose group and 23.8% in the low-dose group (p = 0.04). No difference was noted in major or minor bleeding. In conclusion, a higher loading and maintenance dose of clopidogrel in patients undergoing PCI results in superior platelet inhibition and decreased cardiovascular events without increasing bleeding complications.

Safety endpoints

We found strong evidence for a reduction in the risk of BARC type 3 or type 5 bleeding among patients randomly allocated to P2Y 12 inhibitor monotherapy compared with DAPT (0.89% v 1.83%; hazard ratio 0.49, 0.39 to 0.63; P < 0.001; τ 2 = 0.03), for a number needed to treat to benefit of 111 (77 to 200) over a median treatment duration of 334 days (table 2; fig 5). The treatment effect was consistent across pre-defined subgroups (supplementary figure F), with the exception of a treatment-by-subgroup interaction for type of P2Y 12 inhibitor in the control group (hazard ratio 0.77 (0.50 to 1.18) for clopidogrel and 0.41 (0.30 to 0.55) for newer P2Y 12 inhibitors; P for interaction = 0.02) (supplementary figure F). The use of a newer P2Y 12 inhibitor was associated with treatment-by-subgroup interactions for clinical presentation (acute versus chronic coronary syndrome) and type of P2Y 12 inhibitor in the control group (supplementary figure G). Clopidogrel monotherapy provided consistent treatment effects across pre-defined subgroups (supplementary figure H). The rates of other bleeding endpoints or net adverse clinical events were reduced with P2Y 12 inhibitor monotherapy (table 2).

### P2Yinhibitor monotherapy in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention [^112jf3s9]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

For 20 years, dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT), consisting of the combination of aspirin and a platelet P2Y 12 receptor inhibitor, has been the gold standard of antithrombotic pharmacology after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). In the past 5 years, several investigations have challenged this paradigm by testing the efficacy and safety of P2Y 12 inhibitor monotherapy (that is, without aspirin) following a short course of DAPT. Collectively, these studies suggested a reduction in the risk of major bleeding and no significant increase in thrombotic or ischaemic events compared with guideline-recommended DAPT. Current recommendations are evolving to inform clinical practice on the ideal candidates for P2Y 12 inhibitor monotherapy after PCI. Generalizing the results of studies of P2Y 12 inhibitor monotherapy requires a thorough understanding of their design, populations, interventions, comparators and results. In this Review, we provide an up-to-date overview on the use of P2Y 12 inhibitor monotherapy after PCI, including supporting pharmacodynamic and clinical evidence, practical recommendations and future directions.

### Direct evaluation of antiplatelet therapy in coronary artery disease by comprehensive image-based profiling of circulating platelets [^117W5Yec]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Catheter intervention procedure

The catheter intervention was executed following standard procedures. Initially, a sheath ranging from 5 to 8 Fr was inserted into the radial or femoral artery. Once in place, the activated coagulation time (ACT) was measured, and the residual coagulation test sample was retained for subsequent platelet aggregation analysis. Heparin was then administered at a dose of 3000 U for CAG or 100 U/kg for PCI. Following this, a guiding catheter was engaged in the coronary artery using a 0.035-inch guidewire through the sheath, and ACT was reassessed using the remaining blood sample for further platelet aggregation assessment. In instances of notable stenosis, a functional assessment was conducted, with revascularization performed as deemed necessary by the operator. The PCI was carried out in alignment with established guidelines, encompassing procedures such as balloon dilatation, stent implantation, and atherectomy for calcified lesions. Patients who were free of DAPT before PCI received a loading dose of an antiplatelet drug (mainly the P2Y12 inhibitor) before or during the procedure.

Timing of blood sampling

Preprocedural venous blood samples were drawn within 2 weeks prior to catheterization. During the procedure of CAG or PCI, peripheral arterial samples were derived immediately after inserting a sheath, while coronary arterial samples were obtained through a guiding catheter immediately after the engagement of the catheter. In addition, postprocedural venous sampling was conducted 1–3 days after the procedure. The sampling protocol was applied to multiple procedures in the enrolled patients during the study period.

### How do cardiologists select patients for dual antiplatelet therapy continuation beyond 1 year after a myocardial infarction? Insights from the EYESHOT post-MI study [^111vffb2]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Several studies demonstrated major bleeding events and urgent surgery are the most common reasons for early DAPT interruption. 7, 8, 9 However, few have investigated the reasons why cardiologists prolong or interrupt DAPT beyond the first year after a MI. 10, 11 The EPICOR study (long‐term follow‐up of antithrombotic management patterns in acute coronary syndrome patients), conducted in 2010‐2011 in 20 countries, showed that more than half of patients with MI remained on DAPT beyond 12 months in Europe and Latin America. 10 Subsequently, the TIGRIS registry, conducted in 2013‐2014 in 25 countries, documented DAPT continuation beyond 1 year in 12% of post‐MI patients with high‐risk features enrolled in Europe, 25% in North America and 40% in Asia‐Pacific countries. 11 In both international registries, 10, 11 the presence of frequent PCI with multiple stenting represented the most important determinants of DAPT continuation 1 year after the index MI. The EYESHOT Post‐MI study differs from the above mentioned registries since we enrolled patients exclusively managed by specialists in a nationwide setting and within the first 3 years from the last MI event, allowing assessment of the different selection criteria for DAPT continuation according to the timing from the first recommended year of DAPT and excluding patients who already interrupted DAPT for major bleeding events, need for major surgery, cultural and/or economic reasons. Nevertheless, even in our analysis, a complex PCI with multiple stents implantation, together with the presence of PAD, resulted as independent predictor of DAPT continuation for both patients in the second and in the third year from MI. In this regard, emerging evidences suggest that the magnitude of the benefit with long‐term DAPT is progressively greater per increase in PCI procedural complexity. 21, 22 Similarly, several international registries and analyses from clinical trial databases have demonstrated an increased risk of recurrent ischemic events among patients with MI and PAD, including those receiving an early and effective coronary revascularization, and recent studies also suggested a survival benefit of DAPT continuation in these patients. 23

On the other hand, the presence of atrial fibrillation needing oral anticoagulation therapy was an independent predictor of DAPT interruption in our analysis. This finding is in accordance with recent guidelines and consensus documents recommending a shorter duration of DAPT in order to reduce the risk of major bleeding events. 1, 2, 24

Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) duration — Bayesian triplot for all-cause death integrates prior evidence, trial likelihood, and the posterior. The prior (10 trials) suggests prolonged DAPT could be associated with as much as a 10% reduction or a 34% increase in mortality (OR: 1.10; 95% BCI: 0.90 to 1.34); the likelihood from the DAPT trial more strongly suggests a mortality hazard with increased mortality rate (OR: 1.31; 95% BCI: 0.97 to 1.77); and the combined posterior shows that the mortality rate remains credibly higher after prolonged than after short-course therapy (OR: 1.16; 95% BCI: 0.98 to 1.37).

### Clopidogrel 600-mg double loading dose achieves stronger platelet inhibition than conventional regimens: results from the PREPAIR randomized study [^114hu9yV]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

The objective of this study was to compare the level of platelet inhibition achieved by 3 different clopidogrel loading regimens in patients undergoing elective angiography and percutaneous coronary intervention when appropriate.

Background

Optimal platelet inhibition is a key therapeutic goal for patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. Although 600 mg has been described as the maximum absorbed dose when given as a single bolus, the effects of 2 boluses given 24 h apart have not been described.

Methods

Patients (n = 148) were randomly assigned to one of 3 regimens: Group A, clopidogrel 300 mg the day before (≥ 15 h) + 75 mg the morning of the procedure; Group B, clopidogrel 600 mg the morning of the procedure (≥ 2 h); and Group C, clopidogrel 600 mg the day before (≥ 15 h) and 600 mg the morning of the procedure (≥ 2 h). Blood samples were obtained at baseline and immediately before angiography. Peak and late platelet aggregation were measured in platelet rich plasma, with researchers blinded to treatment allocation.

Results

There was a consistent difference favoring Group C in all aggregation parameters. Percent inhibition in Groups A, B, and C was 31.4%, 29.0%, and 49.5%, respectively, for peak aggregation (5 micromol/l adenosine diphosphate; p < 0.0001) and 54.1%, 57.7%, and 81.1%, respectively, for late aggregation (p < 0.0001). Similar striking reductions were observed when 20 micromol/l adenosine diphosphate was used. All comparisons between Group C and the other 2 groups were statistically significant, and those between Groups A and B were not.

Conclusions

Clopidogrel 600-mg double bolus achieves greater platelet inhibition than conventional single loading doses.

### Critical appraisal of guidelines for coronary artery disease on dual antiplatelet therapy: more consensus than controversies [^114Dvbc7]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

In general, we identified 18 guidelines with recommendations on DAPT for patients with CAD. To the best of our knowledge, it was the first comprehensive evaluation of the international DAPT guidelines. Based on the rigorous systematic assessment recommended by the AGREE II appraisal instrument, we found the general quality of these guidelines to be relatively high, though minor deficiencies still existed. And for the recommendations, there were still inconsistencies primarily with regards to DAPT duration.

Several recently published articles have assessed the quality of clinical guidelines using AGREE II tool, including various topics from different specialties. 6, 29, 30 Low scoring domains in these studies were found mostly in domain 2 "stakeholder involvement", domain 3 "rigor of development" and domain 5 "applicability", which reflected the widespread problem of the existing guidelines in different specialties. In our study, it is somewhat reassuring to note that, most of these DAPT‐relevant guidelines, especially more recent guidelines of ESC, AHA/ACC and NICE got relatively good score in domain "rigor of development". This showed that most DAPT guidelines were strictly followed by evidence‐based principles when they were developed. It was significant as it ensured the DAPT recommendations in these guidelines were based on evidence and were credible. However, similar to other studies, we found most DAPT guidelines got a low score in domain "stakeholder involvement" and "applicability". In contrast to the rigor of the guidelines, most guidelines did not attach importance to the representativeness of the guidelines' stakeholder and the application of the recommendations. In addition, none of the guidelines presented the views and preferences of the target population, which would limit the judicial use of the guidelines in various scenarios. Improving this item would help make the clinical guidelines more accessible to a wider audience. 31 Also, many guidelines failed to present the information regarding the individuals of the development group well. The incomplete professional groups may also impact the applicability of the guidelines and lead to the lower scores in the "applicability" domain. In this domain, most guidelines did not pay attention to the facilitators or barriers to its application. For example, only a few guidelines provided DAPT strategies for patients with fibrinolytic therapy. Although PCI has become the standard of care for ST‐segment elevation myocardial infarction, only a few hospitals can provide on‐site, 24‐hour access to primary PCI in the United States, 32 let alone in developing countries. Similarly, failure to consider potential resources for the recommendations, such as the cost of using the new drugs for DAPT, may also affect the application of these guidelines.

### Dual antiplatelet therapy in non-ST elevation acute coronary syndromes at veterans affairs hospitals [^111aY8mu]. Heart (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

Current guidelines recommend that patients with non-ST elevation acute coronary syndromes (NSTEACS) receive dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) early in hospitalisations. However, observational studies suggest that this rarely occurs. We evaluated site-specific variation and clinical outcomes associated with early DAPT among patients undergoing angiography for NSTEACS.

Methods

In this observational analysis, we identified patients undergoing angiography for NSTEACS in Veterans Affairs hospitals from 2008 to 2016 and assessed characteristics and site variation associated with early DAPT (administration < 24hours of admission). Using propensity matching, we compared time to revascularisation, recurrent myocardial infarction (MI) and mortality between those receiving early DAPT and those not receiving early DAPT (administration ≥ 24hours).

Results

Of 45569 patients undergoing angiography for NSTEACS, 15084 (33%) received early DAPT. Early DAPT was more frequent in patients with non-ST elevation MI, prior surgical revascularisation and among patients undergoing revascularisation. There was a greater than twofold difference in early DAPT across sites, independent of patient characteristics (median OR 2.43, 95%CI 2.28 to 2.55). There was no difference in time topercutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) between groups, but a significant delay to surgical revascularisation with early DAPT (median 4 vs 3 days, p < 0.001) without reduction in hazard of death or MI (HR 1.08, 95%CI 1.00 to 1.16) and similar results demonstrated in the subgroup of patients undergoing revascularisation (HR 1.02, 95%CI 0.91 to 1.13).

Conclusion

Among NSTEACS patients undergoing coronary angiography, early DAPT was not associated with improvement of outcomes but was associated with delays in surgical revascularisation.

### Patient management following percutaneous coronary intervention [^115x5QHQ]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

When determining type and duration of antiplatelet therapy post-PCI, secondary prevention of ischemic events should be balanced with bleeding risk. Recommendations for achieving this differ between patients with stable CAD and acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Among patients with stable CAD, recent evidence supports prescription of short duration (1–3 months) dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT; aspirin plus a P2Y12 inhibitor, eg, clopidogrel, ticagrelor, or prasugrel) followed by single antiplatelet therapy (SAPT). In patients treated with second-generation drug-eluting stents (DES), a meta-analysis of 5 randomized controlled trials found that short duration (1–3 months) DAPT followed by P2Y12 inhibitor SAPT led to reduced bleeding events at 12 months post-PCI compared to 12 months of DAPT. There was no difference in stent thrombosis, all-cause death, MI, and stroke. An exploratory analysis showed short-duration DAPT followed by aspirin SAPT produced similar results. The 2021 ACC/AHA/SCAI Guideline for Coronary Artery Revascularization recommends that short duration DAPT (1–3 months) with subsequent transition to P2Y12 inhibitor monotherapy is reasonable in select patients post-PCI; recommendations from the 2024 ESC (European Society of Cardiology) Guidelines for the management of chronic coronary syndromes are similar.

### Ticagrelor or clopidogrel monotherapy vs DAPT after PCI… [^1163rUV2]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

We obtained data for 26 750 participants. We excluded 203 patients due to premature study termination or death occurring during the initial DAPT phase, which was common to both study groups in 5 trials, 9, 11–13, 17 and 587 patients from 1 study10 owing to lack of approval for data sharing by Chinese regulatory authorities. A total of 25 960 patients were available for the intention-to-treat analysis, including 12 960 patients assigned to P2Y12 inhibitor monotherapy and 13 000 patients assigned to DAPT. A total of 8790 patients receiving ticagrelor monotherapy, 4110 patients receiving clopidogrel monotherapy, and 60 patients receiving prasugrel monotherapy were compared with 8791, 4144, and 65 participants treated with DAPT, respectively. The per-protocol analysis excluded 1566 patients not fulfilling the prespecified criteria, and included 8292 patients receiving ticagrelor monotherapy, 3654 patients receiving clopidogrel monotherapy, and 45 patients receiving prasugrel monotherapy. The median treatment duration was 334 days. A prolonged DAPT regimen was associated with superior outcomes in selected patients for the prevention of cardiovascular events compared with abbreviated DAPT regimens followed by aspirin monotherapy after PCI. 6–8 However, prolonged DAPT increases bleeding risk, which offsets the anticipated ischemic benefits in patients with high bleeding or low ischemic risks.

3–5 Guidelines recommend DAPT duration be guided by ischemic and bleeding risks assessment1, 2; however, they do not provide clear guidance on which treatment should be preferred for the large segment of patients in whom both risks are similar. These results were consistent across subgroups, but an appraisal of absolute risks suggests that the signal of harm may be more relevant in patients with ACS. Conversely, the observed bleeding benefit associated with clopidogrel monotherapy and the null finding for NACE suggest that this strategy is associated with a trade-off of ischemic and bleeding events and might be justified in patients with high bleeding risk. 4.

Identifying the Right Patient

The trials assessing TT studied patients with recent ACS and ≥ 1 additional risk factor. Although several risk stratification scores are available to assess the risk of recurrent ischemic events in ACS patients, such as GRACE (Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events), PURSUIT (Platelet Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa in Unstable Angina: Receptor Suppression Using Integrilin Therapy) and TIMI scores, none of these were used to identify and target those patients with ACS who were truly at high risk. Platelet function tests can also identify patients on clopidogrel at increased risk of MI, stent thrombosis, and cardiovascular death. 34, 35 However, altering pharmacotherapy based on the results of platelet‐function testing failed to reduce recurrent ischemic events in patients undergoing PCI, including for ACS, 36, 37 and current guidelines do not support platelet‐function testing. 15, 38 Finally, patients undergoing complex PCI (defined as the composite of at least 3 stents implanted, at least 3 lesions treated, bifurcation with 2 stents implanted, total stent length > 60 mm, and chronic total occlusion as target lesion) 38, 39 or prior stent thrombosis are clearly at increased risk of thrombosis, 38 and although consideration may be given to longer total duration of DAPT treatment in these patients, the option of TT has not been specifically evaluated. The increased risk of bleeding is a significant concern with more effective antithrombotic agent combinations. Some of this excess bleeding could perhaps potentially be mitigated, at least in part, by careful bleeding risk assessment and use of gastric protection. Because the predominant source of bleeding is gastrointestinal, mandating the use of gastric protection with a proton pump inhibitor would seem pragmatic 22 but was not routinely done in any study. The new 2017 ESC guidelines now clearly recommend the routine use of a proton pump inhibitor for patients taking DAPT, as level of evidence class I, level B, 38 whereas the ACC/AHA 2016 guidelines recommend that "in patients with increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, including those with advanced age and those with concomitant use of warfarin, steroids, or nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs, use of PPIs [proton pump inhibitors] is reasonable (Class IIa)". 15

Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Current perspectives on DAPT after implantation of newer-generation drug-eluting stents (DES) emphasize shorter durations and individualized decisions, with editorials stating that "Courses of clopidogrel exceeding 12 months do not contribute favorably to patient outcomes and may in fact be detrimental", that "DAPT may not be necessary beyond the initial 6 months, at least in low-risk patients", and that "With newer-generation DES, 6 months DAPT might be sufficient, and 3 months not completely off the wall in low-risk groups". Additional commentaries concluded that "Shorter DAPT duration seems very reasonable to consider", that "The safest and most effective duration of dual antiplatelet therapy therefore remains uncertain and must be individualized", and that "The net clinical benefit of 30 months over 12 months DAPT overall seems marginal". For PEGASUS, a critique reported ticagrelor was associated with an absolute benefit of 1.1 percentage points (90-mg) and 1.27 percentage points (60-mg) in the primary end points, with absolute increases of 1.54 and 1.24 percentage points for clinically significant bleeding and 1.71 and 1.37 percentage points for transfusion; treating 10000 patients for 1 year with the 60-mg dose would prevent approximately 42 primary end points and produce approximately 31 TIMI major bleeding events, noted as "close to an even proposition" and a reminder of "the fragile balance between efficacy and adverse events".
