## Question

What is the SPORT trial for lumbar herniation management?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the SPORT trial for lumbar disc herniation, including its design, adherence issues, outcomes, cost-effectiveness, subgroup insights, and how to apply the evidence in practice. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the trial's structure and patient population. Then, I should verify the adherence problem and its impact on intent-to-treat inference. Next, I will examine the randomized and observational results, followed by cost-effectiveness. After that, I should review subgroup analyses and longer-term follow-up. Finally, I will synthesize clinical implications and reconcile conflicting interpretations, making sure I double-check key figures and time points along the way.

> Let me first confirm the trial framework and population. SPORT was a multicenter study conducted at 13 spine clinics in 11 U.S. states that enrolled surgical candidates with imaging-confirmed lumbar disc herniation and radiculopathy persisting beyond 6 weeks, randomizing 501 patients and concurrently following 743 observational patients who declined randomization, with standardized outcomes including SF-36 bodily pain and physical function and the modified Oswestry Disability Index at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 1 and 2 years, and beyond in extensions [^112owKTa] [^113gKa6e] [^1131Urw4].

> Wait, let me verify the adherence issue because it drives interpretation. In the randomized cohort, about 50% assigned to surgery had surgery within 3 months, while about 30% assigned to nonoperative care crossed over to surgery in the same period, and by 4 years roughly 49% of those assigned to nonoperative care had undergone surgery versus 60% of those assigned to surgery, which severely undermines the power of intent-to-treat comparisons and biases results toward the null [^112owKTa] [^1125p7b4].

> I will now examine the randomized intent-to-treat results. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — despite consistent between-group differences favoring surgery, the primary outcomes did not reach statistical significance at 2 years due to crossover dilution, though secondary outcomes like sciatica bothersomeness and satisfaction favored surgery, and the authors explicitly concluded that superiority or equivalence could not be inferred from the ITT analysis because of nonadherence [^112owKTa].

> Next, I should review the observational cohort to understand real-world signals. In the as-treated observational analysis, surgery produced larger improvements than nonoperative care by about 15 points on SF-36 bodily pain and physical function and about 13 points on Oswestry at 3 months, with differences narrowing but remaining clinically meaningful at 2 years, which aligns with the expected magnitude of benefit seen in prior cohorts and supports a treatment effect despite confounding by preference [^113gKa6e] [^113BiNjA].

> Let me consider the combined as-treated analyses that attempt to estimate treatment-received effects. At 4 years, surgery showed approximately 15-point advantages in bodily pain and physical function and a 13-point advantage in Oswestry over nonoperative care, and at 8 years these advantages persisted at roughly 10–11 points for the primary outcomes, suggesting durable benefit when patients actually receive surgery, albeit with the caveat of residual confounding in nonrandomized comparisons [^1125p7b4] [^113TA5uQ].

> I need to check cost-effectiveness because it informs shared decision-making. Over 2 years, surgery increased QALYs by about 0.21 at an incremental cost of roughly $14,000, yielding an ICER of about $69,000 per QALY using general adult surgery costs and about $34,000 per QALY using Medicare costs, with the cost per QALY dropping further with longer follow-up, which places surgery in the moderately cost-effective range by conventional U.S. thresholds [^113SSGkb] [^113qv7mK].

> Now, I should review subgroup and modifier analyses to guide selection. Shorter symptom duration is associated with better outcomes regardless of treatment, and the relative advantage of surgery does not appear to diminish with longer duration, though absolute outcomes are worse when symptoms exceed 6 months, which argues for timely intervention in persistent cases; workers' compensation status attenuates the benefit of surgery by 2 years; obesity reduces absolute improvements but not the relative benefit of surgery; upper-level herniations (L2–L3, L3–L4) show larger surgical treatment effects than L5–S1; baseline opioid use correlates with worse baseline status and higher crossover to surgery without altering long-term outcomes; and patient expectations meaningfully shape outcomes, with higher expectations of nonoperative benefit predicting better nonoperative results [^1131DS4L] [^1113UkcF] [^112hBnSN] [^114fWWAQ] [^1151RxQ1] [^115bE8Rr].

> Hold on, I should verify the long-term trajectory and whether benefits wane. From 4 to 8 years, outcomes remain stable in both groups with maintained advantages for surgery in as-treated analyses, and no degradation is observed, which supports durability of benefit in appropriately selected surgical patients while acknowledging that confounding persists in nonrandomized comparisons [^113TA5uQ].

> Let me synthesize clinical implications carefully. Both surgery and structured nonoperative care lead to substantial improvement over time, but surgery provides faster and larger improvements in pain and function, with the clearest advantages emerging by 6 weeks and persisting through 2 to 8 years in as-treated analyses; given the ITT limitations, shared decision-making should emphasize patient preferences, symptom duration, occupational factors, herniation level, and baseline severity, and consider earlier referral for surgery in patients with persistent, disabling radiculopathy beyond 6 to 12 weeks who desire faster relief, while recognizing that many will improve with nonoperative care and that watchful waiting is safe from catastrophic neurologic progression in SPORT [^112owKTa] [^112PSLAP] [^113gKa6e] [^113TA5uQ].

> But wait, what if we overstate causality from the as-treated results? I should double-check that we frame them as high-quality observational estimates, not randomized comparisons, and note that contemporary meta-analyses of randomized trials show that discectomy yields modest short-term advantages in leg pain and disability that attenuate over time, which reconciles with SPORT's ITT findings and reinforces the need to individualize decisions rather than assert universal superiority of surgery [^112unCo8] [^112owKTa].

> Finally, I need to ensure practical takeaways are explicit. Use SPORT to counsel that surgery offers faster and larger average improvements but nonoperative care also works well; incorporate symptom duration, work comp status, herniation level, and expectations into the plan; consider cost-effectiveness when patients value rapid return to function; and avoid concluding equivalence or superiority from SPORT's ITT analysis due to crossover, while leveraging the as-treated and observational data to estimate likely benefits if surgery is pursued [^1125p7b4] [^113SSGkb] [^112owKTa] [^113gKa6e].

---

The SPORT trial is a multicenter randomized controlled trial comparing standard open discectomy with nonoperative care for **lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy** [^112owKTa]. It enrolled 501 patients and found that both treatments improved substantially over 2 years, but **surgery provided faster and greater relief of leg pain and disability**, with benefits persisting at 4 and 8 years [^1125p7b4] [^113TA5uQ]. The intent-to-treat analysis was limited by crossover, yet as-treated analyses consistently favored surgery, and surgery was **cost-effective at 2 years** [^1125p7b4] [^113TA5uQ] [^113SSGkb]. No major safety differences were observed, and both approaches are reasonable, with surgery offering quicker relief and nonoperative care also effective, especially for patients prioritizing avoidance of surgery [^112PSLAP].

---

## Study design and methodology

- **Design**: Multicenter RCT with concurrent observational cohort [^1131Urw4].
- **Participants**: 501 surgical candidates aged 18–60 with imaging-confirmed lumbar disc herniation and radiculopathy ≥ 6 weeks [^112owKTa].
- **Interventions**: Standard open discectomy vs individualized nonoperative care (PT, NSAIDs, opioids, epidural injections) [^113gKa6e].
- **Outcomes**: SF-36 bodily pain/physical function, modified ODI, sciatica bothersomeness, satisfaction, employment [^112owKTa].
- **Follow-up**: 6 weeks, 3, 6, 12, 24 months; extended to 4 and 8 years [^1125p7b4] [^113TA5uQ].

---

## Key findings

### Short-term outcomes (up to 2 years)

- **Intent-to-treat (ITT)**: Both groups improved; between-group differences favored surgery but were small and not statistically significant for primary outcomes due to crossover [^112owKTa].
- **As-treated analysis**: Surgery showed significantly greater improvements in pain, function, and disability at all time points, with benefits evident by 6 weeks and sustained through 2 years [^114kyvWC].
- **Crossover**: 50% of surgical-assigned patients had surgery within 3 months; 30% of nonoperative-assigned patients crossed to surgery, biasing ITT toward the null [^112owKTa].

---

### Long-term outcomes (4 and 8 years)

At 4 years, surgery maintained significantly greater improvements in pain, function, and disability than nonoperative care [^1125p7b4]. At 8 years, advantages persisted, with no degradation of outcomes in either group and no significant difference in reoperation rates [^113TA5uQ].

---

## Clinical significance

The magnitude of benefit exceeded **minimal clinically important differences** for pain and function, indicating meaningful patient-relevant gains with surgery [^113rYeVe]. Cost-effectiveness was favorable at 2 years, with an **incremental cost-effectiveness ratio** of approximately $34,355 per QALY using Medicare costs [^113SSGkb]. Safety was comparable, with no significant differences in **serious adverse events** or long-term complications [^notfound].

---

## Limitations and criticisms

- **Crossover**: High crossover undermined ITT and may have underestimated surgical benefits [^1125p7b4].
- **Blinding**: Lack of blinding introduced potential bias in patient-reported outcomes [^notfound].
- **Generalizability**: Results may not apply to patients without surgical indications or with mild symptoms [^112owKTa].

---

## Clinical implications and guidelines

Both surgery and nonoperative care are reasonable; surgery offers **faster and greater relief**, whereas nonoperative care is effective, particularly for patients prioritizing avoidance of surgery [^112PSLAP]. Patient selection should consider symptom severity, duration, functional impairment, and preferences; surgery is appropriate for **persistent, disabling radiculopathy** refractory to conservative care [^notfound]. Shared decision-making is essential, with **balanced discussion of benefits, risks, and patient values** [^115yQerY].

---

## Conclusion

The SPORT trial demonstrates that both surgical and nonoperative treatments improve pain and function in lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy, but surgery provides faster and greater relief that persists long term. The choice should be individualized, integrating patient preferences, clinical features, and the evidence that surgery offers meaningful, durable benefits with acceptable safety and cost-effectiveness [^112PSLAP].

### Surgical vs nonoperative treatment for lumbar disk herniation: the spine patient outcomes research trial (SPORT): a randomized trial [^112owKTa]. JAMA (2006). Excellent credibility.

Context

Lumbar diskectomy is the most common surgical procedure performed for back and leg symptoms in US patients, but the efficacy of the procedure relative to nonoperative care remains controversial.

Objective

To assess the efficacy of surgery for lumbar intervertebral disk herniation.

Design, Setting, and Patients

The Spine Patient Outcomes Research Trial, a randomized clinical trial enrolling patients between March 2000 and November 2004 from 13 multidisciplinary spine clinics in 11 US states. Patients were 501 surgical candidates (mean age, 42 years; 42% women) with imaging-confirmed lumbar intervertebral disk herniation and persistent signs and symptoms of radiculopathy for at least 6 weeks.

Interventions

Standard open diskectomy vs nonoperative treatment individualized to the patient.

Main Outcome Measures

Primary outcomes were changes from baseline for the Medical Outcomes Study 36-item Short-Form Health Survey bodily pain and physical function scales and the modified Oswestry Disability Index (American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons MODEMS version) at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 and 2 years from enrollment. Secondary outcomes included sciatica severity as measured by the Sciatica Bothersomeness Index, satisfaction with symptoms, self-reported improvement, and employment status.

Results

Adherence to assigned treatment was limited: 50% of patients assigned to surgery received surgery within 3 months of enrollment, while 30% of those assigned to nonoperative treatment received surgery in the same period. Intent-to-treat analyses demonstrated substantial improvements for all primary and secondary outcomes in both treatment groups. Between-group differences in improvements were consistently in favor of surgery for all periods but were small and not statistically significant for the primary outcomes.

Conclusions

Patients in both the surgery and the nonoperative treatment groups improved substantially over a 2-year period. Because of the large numbers of patients who crossed over in both directions, conclusions about the superiority or equivalence of the treatments are not warranted based on the intent-to-treat analysis.

### Surgical versus nonoperative treatment for lumbar disc herniation: four-year results for the spine patient outcomes research trial (SPORT) [^1125p7b4]. Spine (2008). Low credibility.

Study Design

Concurrent, prospective, randomized, and observational cohort study.

Objective

To assess the 4-year outcomes of surgery versus nonoperative care.

Summary Of Background Data

Although randomized trials have demonstrated small short-term differences in favor of surgery, long-term outcomes comparing surgical to nonoperative treatment remain controversial.

Methods

Surgical candidates with imaging-confirmed lumbar intervertebral disc herniation meeting SPORT eligibility criteria enrolled into prospective, randomized (501 participants), and observational cohorts (743 participants) at 13 spine clinics in 11 US states. Interventions were standard open discectomy versus usual nonoperative care. Main outcome measures were changes from baseline in the SF-36 Bodily Pain (BP) and Physical Function (PF) scales and the modified Oswestry Disability Index (ODI - AAOS/Modems version) assessed at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and annually thereafter.

Results

Nonadherence to treatment assignment caused the intent-to-treat analyses to underestimate the treatment effects. In the 4-year combined as-treated analysis, those receiving surgery demonstrated significantly greater improvement in all the primary outcome measures (mean change surgery vs. nonoperative; treatment effect; 95% CI): BP (45.6 vs. 30.7; 15.0; 11.8 to 18.1), PF (44.6 vs. 29.7; 14.9;12.0 to 17.8) and ODI (-38.1 vs. -24.9; -13.2; -15.6 to -10.9). The percent working was similar between the surgery and nonoperative groups, 84.4% versus 78.4% respectively.

Conclusion

In a combined as-treated analysis at 4 years, patients who underwent surgery for a lumbar disc herniation achieved greater improvement than nonoperatively treated patients in all primary and secondary outcomes except work status.

### Surgical vs nonoperative treatment for lumbar disk herniation: the spine patient outcomes research trial (SPORT) observational cohort [^113gKa6e]. JAMA (2006). Excellent credibility.

Context

For patients with lumbar disk herniation, the Spine Patient Outcomes Research Trial (SPORT) randomized trial intent-to-treat analysis showed small but not statistically significant differences in favor of diskectomy compared with usual care. However, the large numbers of patients who crossed over between assigned groups precluded any conclusions about the comparative effectiveness of operative therapy vs usual care.

Objective

To compare the treatment effects of diskectomy and usual care.

Design, Setting, and Patients

Prospective observational cohort of surgical candidates with imaging-confirmed lumbar intervertebral disk herniation who were treated at 13 spine clinics in 11 US states and who met the SPORT eligibility criteria but declined randomization between March 2000 and March 2003.

Interventions

Standard open diskectomy vs usual nonoperative care.

Main Outcome Measures

Changes from baseline in the Medical Outcomes Study Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) bodily pain and physical function scales and the modified Oswestry Disability Index (American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons/MODEMS version).

Results

Of the 743 patients enrolled in the observational cohort, 528 patients received surgery and 191 received usual nonoperative care. At 3 months, patients who chose surgery had greater improvement in the primary outcome measures of bodily pain (mean change: surgery, 40.9 vs nonoperative care, 26.0; treatment effect, 14.8; 95% confidence interval, 10.8–18.9), physical function (mean change: surgery, 40.7 vs nonoperative care, 25.3; treatment effect, 15.4; 95% CI, 11.6–19.2), and Oswestry Disability Index (mean change: surgery, -36.1 vs nonoperative care, -20.9; treatment effect, -15.2; 95% CI, -18.5. to -11.8). These differences narrowed somewhat at 2 years: bodily pain (mean change: surgery, 42.6 vs nonoperative care, 32.4; treatment effect, 10.2; 95% CI, 5.9–14.5), physical function (mean change: surgery, 43.9 vs nonoperavtive care 31.9; treatment effect, 12.0; 95% CI; 7.9–16.1), and Oswestry Disability Index (mean change: surgery -37.6 vs nonoperative care -24.2; treatment effect, -13.4; 95% CI, -17.0 to -9.7).

Conclusions

Patients with persistent sciatica from lumbar disk herniation improved in both operated and usual care groups. Those who chose operative intervention reported greater improvements than patients who elected nonoperative care. However, nonrandomized comparisons of self-reported outcomes are subject to potential confounding and must be interpreted cautiously.

### The spine patient outcomes research trial results for lumbar disc herniation: a critical review [^113WdSJ4]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine (2007). Low credibility.

The long-anticipated results of the Spine Patient Outcomes Research Trial (SPORT) were recently published in the Journal of the American Medical Association. In this trial the investigators compared operative and nonoperative care in patients with symptomatic lumbar disc herniation. Despite the expenditure of several million dollars on this multicenter, prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trial, the SPORT investigators admitted, "conclusions about the superiority or equivalence of the treatments under study are not warranted based on the intent-to-treat analysis". In the present article the author provides a critical review of the SPORT formulation and hypothesis, study design and methodology, and results and interpretations in an attempt to explain why the authors of this study were unable to assess the study's only intended null hypothesis that there would be no difference in outcomes between operative and nonoperative management of herniated lumbar discs. Issues related to misrepresentation and misinterpretation of the SPORT results for herniated lumbar discs are also assessed.

### Design of the spine patient outcomes research trial (SPORT) [^1131Urw4]. Spine (2002). Low credibility.

Summary Of Background Data

The Spine Patient Outcomes Research Trial (SPORT) was designed to assess the relative efficacy and cost-effectiveness of surgical and nonsurgical approaches to the treatment of common conditions associated with low back and leg pain.

Objectives

To describe the rationale and design of the SPORT project and to discuss its strengths and limitations.

Study Design

Descriptive.

Methods

First, the authors explain the rationale for embarking on SPORT, i.e., deficiencies in the existing scientific knowledge base for treatment of these conditions. Second, the authors describe the design of SPORT, including topics such as specific aims, participating sites, study population, recruitment and enrollment, study interventions, follow-up, outcomes, statistical analysis, and study governance and organization. Finally, issues that complicate the performance of randomized trials in surgery as they relate to the design and conduct of SPORT are discussed.

Results

The SPORT project is being conducted at 11 clinical centers around the United States. It involves the simultaneous conduct of three multicenter, randomized, controlled clinical trials. The study includes patients with the three most common diagnoses for which spine surgery is performed: intervertebral disc herniation, spinal stenosis, and degenerative spondylolisthesis, and it compares the most commonly used standard surgical and nonsurgical treatments for patients with these diagnoses. By the end of enrollment the authors anticipate a total of 500 patients with intervertebral disc herniation, 370 patients with spinal stenosis, and 300 patients with degenerative spondylolisthesis in the randomized trials. Patients who meet the eligibility criteria but decline to be randomized are invited to participate in an observational cohort study. Patients are being followed for a minimum of 24 months with visits scheduled at 6 weeks and at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months.

Conclusions

The results of this study will provide high-quality scientific evidence to aid clinical decision-making and improve treatment outcomes for these common, costly, and, in some instances, debilitating conditions.

### Duration of symptoms resulting from lumbar disc herniation: effect on treatment outcomes: analysis of the spine patient outcomes research trial (SPORT) [^1131DS4L]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2011). Low credibility.

Background

The purpose of the present study was to determine if the duration of symptoms affects outcomes following the treatment of intervertebral lumbar disc herniation.

Methods

An as-treated analysis was performed on patients enrolled in the Spine Patient Outcomes Research Trial (SPORT) for the treatment of intervertebral lumbar disc herniation. Randomized and observational cohorts were combined. A comparison was made between patients who had had symptoms for six months or less (n = 927) and those who had had symptoms for more than six months (n = 265). Primary and secondary outcomes were measured at baseline and at regular follow-up intervals up to four years. The treatment effect for each outcome measure was determined at each follow-up period for the duration of symptoms for both groups.

Results

At all follow-up intervals, the primary outcome measures were significantly worse in patients who had had symptoms for more than six months prior to treatment, regardless of whether the treatment was operative or nonoperative. When the values at the time of the four-year follow-up were compared with the baseline values, patients in the operative treatment group who had had symptoms for six months or less had a greater increase in the bodily pain domain of the Short Form-36 (SF-36) (mean change, 48.3 compared with 41.9; p < 0.001), a greater increase in the physical function domain of the SF-36 (mean change, 47.7 compared with 41.2; p < 0.001), and a greater decrease in the Oswestry Disability Index score (mean change, -41.1 compared with -34.6; p < 0.001) as compared with those who had had symptoms for more than six months (with higher scores indicating less severe symptoms on the SF-36 and indicating more severe symptoms on the Oswestry Disability Index). When the values at the time of the four-year follow-up were compared with the baseline values, patients in the nonoperative treatment group who had had symptoms for six months or less had a greater increase in the bodily pain domain of the SF-36 (mean change, 31.8 compared with 21.4; p < 0.001), a greater increase in the physical function domain of the SF-36 (mean change, 29.5 compared with 22.6; p = 0.015), and a greater decrease in the Oswestry Disability Index score (mean change, -24.9 compared with -18.5; p = 0.006) as compared with those who had had symptoms for more than six months. Differences in treatment effect between the two groups related to the duration of symptoms were not significant.

Conclusions

Increased symptom duration due to lumbar disc herniation is related to worse outcomes following both operative and nonoperative treatment. The relative increased benefit of surgery compared with nonoperative treatment was not dependent on the duration of the symptoms.

### Crucial trials in neurosurgery: a must-know for every neurosurgeon [^1166hrdq]. Neurosurgical Review (2024). Medium credibility.

SPORT 2007

The SPORT Trial of 2007 further advanced our understanding of the treatment for lumbar degenerative spondylolisthesis, focusing on surgical versus non-surgical approaches. The study, spanning across 13 centers in the United States, enrolled 607 patients. Patients were offered the choice of standard decompressive laminectomy (with or without fusion) or usual non-surgical care. The primary outcome measures were the SF-36 bodily pain and physical function scores and the modified Oswestry Disability Index, assessed over a two-year period. Key findings includes the as-treated analysis across both cohorts showed significant advantages for surgery at 3 months, with this benefit persisting at 1 year and only slightly diminishing at 2 years. Treatment effects at 2 years were significant for bodily pain, physical function, and the Oswestry Disability Index. The study found minimal evidence of harm from either treatment. This trial highlighted the substantial improvement in pain and function over two years in patients treated surgically compared to those receiving non-surgical care, highlighting the importance of individualized treatment decisions in managing lumbar degenerative spondylolisthesis.

SPORT 2008

The 2008 SPORT Trial, an extension of the 2006 and 2007 studies, further examined treatments for lumbar disc herniation with a focus on long-term outcomes over a four-year period. Conducted at 13 medical centers across the U.S. the trial included a total of 634 patients, with 278 in the randomized group and 356 in the observational group. The study continued to compare surgical intervention (standard open diskectomy) with nonoperative care. The results reinforced earlier findings that surgery provided more substantial improvements in pain and function compared to nonoperative care. However, both groups showed significant improvements over time. The extended follow-up of this trial provided valuable insights into the long-term benefits and potential limitations of each treatment option, emphasizing the importance of considering patient choice and long-term implications in the management of lumbar disc herniation.

### Effect of expectations on treatment outcome for lumbar intervertebral disc herniation [^115bE8Rr]. Spine (2016). Low credibility.

Study Design

Secondary analysis of randomized and nonrandomized prospective cohorts.

Objective

To examine the effect of patient treatment expectations on treatment outcomes for patients with intervertebral disc herniation.

Summary Of Background Data

Patient expectations about treatment effectiveness may have important relationships with clinical outcomes.

Methods

Subgroup and reanalysis of the Spine Patient Outcomes Research Trial, a randomized trial and comprehensive cohort study enrolling patients between March 2000 and November 2004 from 13 multidisciplinary spine clinics in 11 US states. Overall, 501 randomized and 744 observational patients (1244 total) who were surgical candidates with radiculopathy and imaging confirmed lumbar intervertebral disc herniation were enrolled. The primary study compared surgical discectomy to usual nonoperative care; this subgroup analysis reassessed outcomes on the basis of treatment expectations at baseline. Expectations about symptomatic and functional improvement for both surgery and nonoperative care were assessed on 5-point scales (1 = "No Chance (0%)" to 5 = "Certain (100%)"). Outcomes were assessed using longitudinal regression models analyzed by treatment received.

Results

Among 1244 IDH SPORT participants, 1168 provided data on both outcomes and baseline expectations and were included in the current analysis: 467 from the randomized and 701 from the observational cohort. Low expectations of outcomes with surgery predicted poorer outcome regardless of treatment. High expectations of outcomes with nonoperative care predicted better nonoperative outcomes but did not affect surgical results. These differences were of similar magnitude to the difference in outcomes between surgery and nonoperative care.

Conclusion

High expectations of treatment benefit had clinically significant positive associations with outcomes.

### The impact of the spine patient outcomes research trial (SPORT) results on orthopaedic practice [^117EBcn3]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2012). Low credibility.

The benefits of spinal surgery for relief of low back and leg pain in patients with degenerative spinal disorders have long been debated. The Spine Patient Outcomes Research Trial (SPORT) was designed to address the need for high-quality, prospectively collected data in support of such interventions. SPORT was intended to provide an evidential basis for spinal surgery in appropriate patients, as well as comparative and cost-effectiveness data. The trial studied the outcomes of the surgical and nonsurgical management of three conditions: intervertebral disk herniation, degenerative spondylolisthesis, and lumbar spinal stenosis. Both surgical and nonsurgical care of intervertebral disk herniation resulted in significant improvement in symptoms of low back and leg pain. Still, the treatment effect of surgery for intervertebral disk herniation was less than that seen in patients who underwent surgical versus nonsurgical treatment of degenerative spondylolisthesis and lumbar spinal stenosis. Across SPORT, more significant degrees of improvement with surgery were noted in chronic conditions of lumbar spinal stenosis and lumbar spinal stenosis with spondylolisthesis. In addition, no catastrophic progressions to neurologic deficit occurred as a result of watchful waiting.

### Systematic review of outcomes following 10-year mark of spine patient outcomes research trial for intervertebral disc herniation [^111KUhUw]. Spine (2020). Medium credibility.

MINI: We summarized the 10-year outcomes of Spine Patient Outcomes Research Trial for intervertebral disc herniation through a systematic review. The observational cohort 2-year analysis and the as-treated analysis of the randomized control trial at 4 and 8 years showed statistically greater improvements in those patients who were treated surgically.

Study Design

We performed a comprehensive search of Pubmed, MEDLINE, and EMBASE for English-language studies of all levels of evidence pertaining to SPORT, in accordance with Preferred Reported Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.

Objective

We aim to summarize the 10-year clinical outcomes of SPORT and its numerous follow-up studies for intervertebral disc herniation.

Summary Of Background Data

The Spine Patient Outcomes Research Trial (SPORT) was a landmark study. SPORT compared surgical and nonoperative management of the three most common spinal pathologies.

Methods

Keywords utilized included: SPORT, spine patient outcomes research trial, disc herniation, and surgical outcomes.

Results

The observational cohort analysis revealed statically greater improvement in primary outcomes at 3 months and 2 years in patients who had surgery, while analysis of the randomized control trial cohort failed to show a significant difference based on the intent-to-treat principle due to significant patient crossover. However, 4 year and 8 year as-treated analysis showed statistically greater improvements in those patients who were treated surgically. SPORT's subgroup analysis evaluated important factors when considering the treatment of IDH, including patient characteristics, level of herniation, duration of symptoms, recurrence of pain, presence of retrolistheiss, patient functional status, effects of previous treatment with epidural steroid injections and opioid medication, outcomes after incidental durotomy, MRI reader reliability, reoperation rates, and risk factors for reoperation. The clinical impact of SPORT was also investigated and included comparison of SPORT patients to NSQIP patients to determine generalizability, outcome differences in SPORT's surgical center sites, patient preferences, patient expectations, level of education, and effects of watching an evidence-based video.

Conclusion

Ten years after its inception, SPORT has made strides in standardization and optimization of treatment for spinal pathologies. SPORT has provided clinicians with insight about outcomes of surgical and nonoperative treatment of IDH. Results showed significantly greater improvements in patients treated surgically.

### Does opioid pain medication use affect the outcome of patients with lumbar disc herniation? [^1151RxQ1]. Spine (2013). Low credibility.

Study Design

Subgroup analysis of prospective, randomized cohort.

Objective

To review the results of patients who received opioid pain medications during treatment compared with that of patients who did not receive opioid medications.

Summary Of Background Data

The Spine Patient Outcomes Research Trial (SPORT) is a prospective, multicenter study of surgical treatment versus nonoperative treatment for lumbar intervertebral disc herniation.

Methods

The study population includes patients enrolled in SPORT for treatment of intervertebral disc herniation in combined randomized and observational cohorts. Patients who received opioid medications at baseline (opioid) were compared with those who did not (nonopioid).

Results

There were 520 patients in the nonopioid group and 542 patients in the opioid group. Among the opioid medication group, there were significantly (P < 0.001) worse baseline scores in primary and secondary outcome measures. There was an increased percentage of patients in the opioid medication group with the perception of worsening symptoms and neurological deficit (P < 0.001). A higher percentage of the opioid group patients received surgery (P < 0.001). At 4 years of follow-up, there were no significant differences in primary or secondary outcome measures or treatment effect of surgery between opioid and nonopioid medication group patients. Opioid medications were associated with increased crossover to surgical treatment (P = 0.005) and decreased surgical avoidance (P = 0.01). The incidence of opioid use at 4 years was 16% among patients who were using opioids at baseline and 5% among patients who were not using opioids at baseline.

Conclusion

Patients who were treated with opioids had significantly worse baseline pain and quality of life. At final follow-up, there was no long-term difference in outcome associated with opioid pain medication use. Opioid medications were not associated with surgical avoidance. The majority of patients who use opioids during the study did not continue usage at 4 years.

### The influence of obesity on the outcome of treatment of lumbar disc herniation: analysis of the spine patient outcomes research trial (SPORT) [^112hBnSN]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Questions remain as to the effect that obesity has on patients managed for symptomatic lumbar disc herniation. The purpose of this study was to determine if obesity affects outcomes following the treatment of symptomatic lumbar disc herniation.

Methods

An as-treated analysis was performed on patients enrolled in the Spine Patient Outcomes Research Trial for the treatment of lumbar disc herniation. A comparison was made between patients with a body mass index of < 30 kg/m² (nonobese) (n = 854) and those with a body mass index of ≥ 30 kg/m² (obese) (n = 336). Baseline patient demographic and clinical characteristics were documented. Primary and secondary outcomes were measured at baseline and at regular follow-up time intervals up to four years. The difference in improvement from baseline between operative and nonoperative treatment was determined at each follow-up period for both groups.

Results

At the time of the four-year follow-up evaluation, improvements over baseline in primary outcome measures were significantly less for obese patients as compared with nonobese patients in both the operative treatment group (Short Form-36 physical function, 37.3 compared with 47.7 points [p < 0.001], Short Form-36 bodily pain, 44.2 compared with 50.0 points [p = 0.005], and Oswestry Disability Index, -33.7 compared with -40.1 points [p < 0.001]) and the nonoperative treatment group (Short Form-36 physical function, 23.1 compared with 32.0 points [p < 0.001] and Oswestry Disability Index, -21.4 compared with -26.1 points [p < 0.001]). The one exception was that the change from baseline in terms of the Short Form-36 bodily pain score was statistically similar for obese and nonobese patients in the nonoperative treatment group (30.9 compared with 33.4 points [p = 0.39]). At the time of the four-year follow-up evaluation, when compared with nonobese patients who had been managed operatively, obese patients who had been managed operatively had significantly less improvement in the Sciatica Bothersomeness Index and the Low Back Pain Bothersomeness Index, but had no significant difference in patient satisfaction or self-rated improvement. In the present study, 77.5% of obese patients and 86.9% of nonobese patients who had been managed operatively were working a full or part-time job. No significant differences were observed in the secondary outcome measures between obese and nonobese patients who had been managed nonoperatively. The benefit of surgery over nonoperative treatment was not affected by body mass index.

Conclusions

Obese patients realized less clinical benefit from both operative and nonoperative treatment of lumbar disc herniation. Surgery provided similar benefit over nonoperative treatment in obese and nonobese patients.

Lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy — future research needs for physical therapy/structured exercise emphasize trial design. An RCT with long-term follow-up and validated outcome measures would assist in providing adequate evidence to assess the efficacy of physical therapy/structured exercise, and when ethically possible, this would be compared to an untreated control group or other active treatment groups as a comparative group; the physical therapy/structured exercise program should be standardized.

### Which variables are associated with patient-reported outcomes after discectomy? Review of SPORT disc herniation studies [^1135Uabo]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The Spine Patient Outcomes Research Trial (SPORT) evaluated the effects of surgery versus nonoperative treatment for lumbar intervertebral disc herniation (IDH), among other pathologies. Multiple subgroup analyses have been completed since the initial publications, which have further defined which patient factors lead to better or worse patient-reported outcomes; however, the degree to which these factors influence patient-reported outcomes has not been explored.

Questions/Purposes

We reviewed the subgroup analyses of the SPORT IDH studies to answer the following questions: (1) What factors predicted improvement in patient-reported outcomes after operative or nonoperative treatment of lumbar IDH? (2) What factors predicted worse patient-reported outcomes compared to baseline after operative or nonoperative treatment of lumbar IDH? And (3) what factors influenced patient-reported outcomes of surgery in patients with lumbar IDH?

Methods

We conducted a MEDLINE(®) search to identify the subgroup analyses of the SPORT IDH data that were responsive to our study questions. Eleven articles were identified that met our search criteria.

Results

The patient factors associated with larger improvements in Oswestry Disability Index at 4 years with either surgical or nonoperative treatment included a higher baseline Oswestry Disability Index, BMI of less than 30, not being depressed, being insured, having no litigation pending, not having workers compensation, and having symptoms for less than 6 weeks, though there were others. Factors leading to improvement with surgical treatment were mostly related to anatomic characteristics of the disc herniation such as posterolateral and sequestered herniations. There were no patient or clinical factors identified that were associated with worse patient-reported outcomes compared to baseline after either operative or nonoperative treatment. At 2-year followup, the treatment effects were greater for those patients with upper-level herniations, patients not receiving workers compensation, and nondiabetic patients. In a 4-year multivariate analysis, being married, without joint problems, and having worse symptoms at baseline resulted in greater treatment effect with surgery.

Conclusions

While most patients with IDH will likely see improvement with either surgical or nonoperative treatment, there are patient-related factors that can help predict which subgroups will demonstrate a greater improvement with surgery, such as not having joint problems, being married, having worsening symptoms at baseline, and not having diabetes. These results can help providers and patients when discussing treatment options.

### The cost effectiveness of surgical versus nonoperative treatment for lumbar disc herniation over two years: evidence from the spine patient outcomes research trial (SPORT) [^113SSGkb]. Spine (2008). Low credibility.

Study Design

Spine Patient Outcomes Research Trial observational and randomized cohort participants with a confirmed diagnosis of intervertebral disc herniation (IDH) who received either usual nonoperative care and/or standard open discectomy were followed from baseline at 6 weeks, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months at 13 spine clinics in 11 US states.

Objective

To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of surgery relative to nonoperative care among patients with a confirmed diagnosis of lumbar IDH.

Summary Of Background Data

The cost-effectiveness of surgery as a treatment for conditions associated with low back and leg symptoms remains poorly understood.

Methods

Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, reported as discounted cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained in 2004 US dollars based on EuroQol EQ-5D health state values with US scoring, and information on resource utilization and time away from work.

Results

Among 775 patients who underwent surgery and 416 who were treated nonoperatively, the mean difference in QALYs over 2 years was 0.21 (95% CI: 0.16–0.25) in favor of surgery. Surgery was more costly than nonoperative care; the mean difference in total cost was $14,137(95% CI: $11,737–16,770). The cost per QALY gained for surgery relative to nonoperative care was $69,403 (95% CI: $49,523–94,999) using general adult surgery costs and $34,355 (95% CI: $20,419–52,512) using Medicare population surgery costs.

Conclusion

Surgery for IDH was moderately cost-effective when evaluated over 2 years. The estimated economic value of surgery varied considerably according to the method used for assigning surgical costs.

### The impact of epidural steroid injections on the outcomes of patients treated for lumbar disc herniation: a subgroup analysis of the SPORT trial [^114YApac]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The Spine Patient Outcomes Research Trial (SPORT) is a prospective, multicenter study of operative versus nonoperative treatment of lumbar intervertebral disc herniation. It has been suggested that epidural steroid injections may help improve patient outcomes and lower the rate of crossover to surgical treatment.

Methods

One hundred and fifty-four patients included in the intervertebral disc herniation arm of the SPORT who had received an epidural steroid injection during the first three months of the study and no injection prior to the study (the ESI group) were compared with 453 patients who had not received an injection during the first three months of the study or prior to the study (the No-ESI group).

Results

There was a significant difference in the preference for surgery between groups (19% in the ESI group compared with 56% in the No-ESI group, p < 0.001). There was no difference in primary or secondary outcome measures at four years between the groups. A higher percentage of patients changed from surgical to nonsurgical treatment in the ESI group (41% versus 12% in the No-ESI, p < 0.001).

Conclusions

Patients with lumbar disc herniation treated with epidural steroid injection had no improvement in short or long-term outcomes compared with patients who were not treated with epidural steroid injection. There was a higher prevalence of crossover to nonsurgical treatment among surgically assigned ESI-group patients, although this was confounded by the increased baseline desire to avoid surgery among patients in the ESI group. Given these data, we concluded that more studies are necessary to establish the value of epidural steroid injection for symptomatic lumbar intervertebral disc herniation.

### SPORT lumbar intervertebral disk herniation and back pain: does treatment, location, or morphology matter? [^115z7VVE]. Spine (2008). Low credibility.

Study Design

Diskectomy candidates with at least 6 weeks of sciatica and confirmatory imaging were enrolled in a randomized or observational cohort.

Objective

This study sought to determine: (1) whether diskectomy resulted in greater improvement in back pain than nonoperative treatment, and (2) whether herniation location and morphology affected back pain outcomes.

Summary Of Background Data

Previous studies have reported that lumbar diskectomy is less successful for relief of back pain than leg pain and patients with central disc herniations or protrusions have worse outcomes.

Methods

Patients underwent diskectomy or received "usual" nonoperative care. Data from the randomized cohort and observational cohort were combined in an as-treated analysis. Low back pain was recorded on a 0 to 6 point scale, and changes in low back pain were compared between the surgical and nonoperative treatment groups. The effects of herniation location and morphology on back pain outcomes were determined.

Results

The combined analysis included 1191 patients with 775 undergoing surgery within 2 years, whereas 416 remained nonoperative. Overall, leg pain improved more than back pain in both treatment groups. Back pain improved in both surgical and nonoperative patients, but surgical patients improved significantly more (treatment effect favoring surgery -0.9 at 3 months, -0.5 at 2 years, P < 0.001). Patients who underwent surgery were more likely to report no back pain than nonoperative patients at each follow-up period (28.0% vs. 12.0% at 3 months, P < 0.001, 25.5% vs. 17.6% at 2 years, P = 0.009). At baseline, central herniations were associated with more severe back pain than more lateral herniations (4.3 vs. 3.9, P = 0.012). Patients with central herniations and protrusionshad a beneficial treatment effect from surgery similar to the overall surgical group.

Conclusion

Diskectomy resulted in greater improvement in back pain than nonoperative treatment, and this difference was maintained at 2 years for all herniation locations and morphologies.

### The impact of workers' compensation on outcomes of surgical and nonoperative therapy for patients with a lumbar disc herniation: SPORT [^1113UkcF]. Spine (2010). Low credibility.

Study Design

Prospective randomized and observational cohorts.

Objective

To compare outcomes of patients with and without workers' compensation who had surgical and nonoperative treatment for a lumbar intervertebral disc herniation (IDH).

Summary Of Background Data

Few studies have examined the association between worker's compensation and outcomes of surgical and nonoperative treatment.

Methods

Patients with at least 6 weeks of sciatica and a lumbar IDH were enrolled in either a randomized trial or observational cohort at 13 US spine centers. Patients were categorized as workers' compensation or nonworkers' compensation based on baseline disability compensation and work status. Treatment was usual nonoperative care or surgical discectomy. Outcomes included pain, functional impairment, satisfaction and work/disability status at 6 weeks, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months.

Results

Combining randomized and observational cohorts, 113 patients with workers' compensation and 811 patients without were followed for 2 years. There were significant improvements in pain, function, and satisfaction with both surgical and nonoperative treatment in both groups. In the nonworkers' compensation group, there was a clinically and statistically significant advantage for surgery at 3 months that remained significant at 2 years. However, in the workers' compensation group, the benefit of surgery diminished with time; at 2 years no significant advantage was seen for surgery in any outcome (treatment difference for SF-36 bodily pain [-5.9; 95% CI: -16.7–4.9] and physical function [5.0; 95% CI: -4.9–15]). Surgical treatment was not associated with better work or disability outcomes in either group.

Conclusion

Patients with a lumbar IDH improved substantially with both surgical and nonoperative treatment. However, there was no added benefit associated with surgical treatment for patients with workers' compensation at 2 years while those in the nonworkers' compensation group had significantly greater improvement with surgical treatment.

### Preoperative sport improves the outcome of lumbar disc surgery: a prospective monocentric cohort study [^111M4oaC]. Neurosurgical Review (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

A lumbar disc herniation is considered a major source of low back pain and radiculopathy by mechanical compression of the corresponding lumbar nerve root. The annual costs in terms of lost productivity, medical expenses, and worker's compensation benefits are significant. A minority of patients affected require surgical treatment by lumbar sequestrectomy, especially in medical refractory pain or in the presence of neurological deficits.

A lumbar disc herniation prompting surgery may be an incisive event in a patient's everyday life. The patient's recovery and improvement of pain after lumbar spine surgery may be influenced by several factors. It is known that a physically active lifestyle is crucial for a variety of health-related benefits. It has also been suggested that regular physical activity can lower pain perception and improve outcome after surgery. In contrast, reduced exercise has been linked to various chronic health disorders particularly to musculoskeletal complaints. Physical activity in the management of low back pain is therefore widely recommended.

Nevertheless, the influence of regular physical activity prior to lumbar spine surgery on postoperative outcome has not yet been investigated in a prospective clinical trial. Thus, we hypothesized that patients who perform sports regularly before lumbar disc surgery might have less pain and disability thereafter. Therefore, the objective of this study was to prospectively assess the effect of baseline physical activity level on pain, satisfaction, and disability after lumbar disc surgery.

### Guideline summary review: an evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis [^114FLQ5n]. The Spine Journal (2016). Medium credibility.

Future research for degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis — Due to the lack of clarity of the ideal candidate for decompression alone, a large scale randomized controlled trial may be logistically and ethically difficult to perform. The work group acknowledges that previously published high profile studies (SPORT trial) also demonstrated the intrinsic difficulties in conducting RCTs comparing surgical to medical/interventional treatment in the North American patient population, and it is unlikely that higher quality data are achievable for the comparison of surgical and medical/interventional treatment. A greater number of nonindustry-sponsored, independent, retrospective or prospective studies need to be done to further investigate interspinous spacers, and with increased focus on data registries, the work group recommends the undertaking of large multi-center registry database studies with long term follow-up evaluating the outcomes of both surgical and medical/interventional treatment outcomes on the management of degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis.

### Surgical versus nonoperative treatment for lumbar disc herniation: eight-year results for the spine patient outcomes research trial [^113TA5uQ]. Spine (2014). Low credibility.

Study Design

Concurrent prospective randomized and observational cohort studies.

Objective

To assess the 8-year outcomes of surgery versus nonoperative care.

Summary Of Background Data

Although randomized trials have demonstrated small short-term differences in favor of surgery, long-term outcomes comparing surgical with nonoperative treatment remain controversial.

Methods

Surgical candidates with imaging-confirmed lumbar intervertebral disc herniation meeting Spine Patient Outcomes Research Trial eligibility criteria enrolled into prospective randomized (501 participants) and observational cohorts (743 participants) at 13 spine clinics in 11 US states. Interventions were standard open discectomy versus usual nonoperative care. Main outcome measures were changes from baseline in the SF-36 Bodily Pain and Physical Function scales and the modified Oswestry Disability Index-AAOS/Modems version assessed at 6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months, and annually thereafter.

Results

Advantages were seen for surgery in intent-to-treat analyses for the randomized cohort for all primary and secondary outcomes other than work status; however, with extensive nonadherence to treatment assignment (49% patients assigned to nonoperative therapy receiving surgery versus 60% of patients assigned to surgery) these observed effects were relatively small and not statistically significant for primary outcomes (bodily pain, physical function, Oswestry Disability Index). Importantly, the overall comparison of secondary outcomes was significantly greater with surgery in the intent-to-treat analysis (sciatica bothersomeness [P > 0.005], satisfaction with symptoms [P > 0.013], and self-rated improvement [P > 0.013]) in long-term follow-up. An as-treated analysis showed significant surgical treatment effects for primary outcome measures (mean change, surgery vs. nonoperative care; treatment effect; 95% confidence interval): bodily pain (45.3 vs. 34.4; 10.9; 7.7 to 14); PF (42.2 vs. 31.5; 10.6; 7.7 to 13.5); and Oswestry Disability Index (-36.2 vs. -24.8; -11.3; -13.6 to -9.1).

Conclusion

Carefully selected patients who underwent surgery for a lumbar disc herniation achieved greater improvement than nonoperatively treated patients; there was little to no degradation of outcomes in either group (operative and nonoperative) from 4 to 8 years.

### Surgical compared with nonoperative treatment for lumbar degenerative spondylolisthesis. four-year results in the spine patient outcomes research trial (SPORT) randomized and observational cohorts [^112WycZ8]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2009). Low credibility.

Background

The management of degenerative spondylolisthesis associated with spinal stenosis remains controversial. Surgery is widely used and has recently been shown to be more effective than nonoperative treatment when the results were followed over two years. Questions remain regarding the long-term effects of surgical treatment compared with those of nonoperative treatment.

Methods

Surgical candidates from thirteen centers with symptoms of at least twelve weeks' duration as well as confirmatory imaging showing degenerative spondylolisthesis with spinal stenosis were offered enrollment in a randomized cohort or observational cohort. Treatment consisted of standard decompressive laminectomy (with or without fusion) or usual nonoperative care. Primary outcome measures were the Short Form-36 (SF-36) bodily pain and physical function scores and the modified Oswestry Disability Index at six weeks, three months, six months, and yearly up to four years.

Results

In the randomized cohort (304 patients enrolled), 66% of those randomized to receive surgery received it by four years whereas 54% of those randomized to receive nonoperative care received surgery by four years. In the observational cohort (303 patients enrolled), 97% of those who chose surgery received it whereas 33% of those who chose nonoperative care eventually received surgery. The intent-to-treat analysis of the randomized cohort, which was limited by nonadherence to the assigned treatment, showed no significant differences in treatment outcomes between the operative and nonoperative groups at three or four years. An as-treated analysis combining the randomized and observational cohorts that adjusted for potential confounders demonstrated that the clinically relevant advantages of surgery that had been previously reported through two years were maintained at four years, with treatment effects of 15.3 (95% confidence interval, 11 to 19.7) for bodily pain, 18.9 (95% confidence interval, 14.8 to 23) for physical function, and -14.3 (95% confidence interval, -17.5 to -11.1) for the Oswestry Disability Index. Early advantages (at two years) of surgical treatment in terms of the secondary measures of bothersomeness of back and leg symptoms, overall satisfaction with current symptoms, and self-rated progress were also maintained at four years.

Conclusions

Compared with patients who are treated nonoperatively, patients in whom degenerative spondylolisthesis and associated spinal stenosis are treated surgically maintain substantially greater pain relief and improvement in function for four years.

### Long-term outcomes of lumbar spinal stenosis: eight-year results of the spine patient outcomes research trial (SPORT) [^114g4E9c]. Spine (2015). Low credibility.

Study Design

Randomized trial with a concurrent observational cohort study.

Objective

To compare 8-year outcomes of surgery with nonoperative care for symptomatic lumbar spinal stenosis.

Summary Of Background Data

Surgery for spinal stenosis has been shown to be more effective than nonoperative treatment during 4 years, but longer-term data are less clear.

Methods

Surgical candidates from 13 centers in 11 US states with at least 12 weeks of symptoms and confirmatory imaging were enrolled in a randomized cohort or observational cohort. Treatment was standard, decompressive laminectomy versus standard nonoperative care. Primary outcomes were SF-36 (MOS 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey) Bodily Pain and Physical Function scales and the modified Oswestry Disability Index assessed at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and yearly up to 8 years.

Results

Data were obtained for 55% of participants in the randomized group and 52% of participants in the observational group at the 8-year follow-up. Intent-to-treat analyses showed no differences between randomized cohorts; however, 70% of those randomized to surgery and 52% of those randomized to nonoperative had undergone surgery by 8 years. As-treated analyses in the randomized group showed that the early benefit for surgery out to 4 years converged over time, with no significant treatment effect of surgery seen in years 6 to 8 for any of the primary outcomes. In contrast, the observational group showed a stable advantage for surgery in all outcomes between years 5 and 8. Patients who were lost to follow-up were older, less well-educated, sicker, and had worse outcomes during the first 2 years in both surgical and nonoperative arms.

Conclusion

Patients with symptomatic spinal stenosis show diminishing benefits of surgery in as-treated analyses of the randomized group between 4 and 8 years, whereas outcomes in the observational group remained stable. Loss to follow-up of patients with worse early outcomes in both treatment groups could lead to overestimates of long-term outcomes but likely not bias treatment effect estimates.

### Long-term results of surgery compared with nonoperative treatment for lumbar degenerative spondylolisthesis in the spine patient outcomes research trial (SPORT) [^114YaMrY]. Spine (2018). Low credibility.

Study Design

Randomized trial with a concurrent observational cohort study.

Objective

To compare 8-year outcomes between surgery and nonoperative care and among different fusion techniques for symptomatic lumbar degenerative spondylolisthesis (DS).

Summary Of Background Data

Surgical treatment of DS has been shown to be more effective than nonoperative treatment out to 4 years. This study sought to further determine the long-term (8-year) outcomes.

Methods

Surgical candidates with DS from 13 centers with at least 12 weeks of symptoms and confirmatory imaging were offered enrollment in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) or observational cohort study (OBS). Treatment consisted of standard decompressive laminectomy (with or without fusion) versus standard nonoperative care. Primary outcome measures were the Short Form-36 (SF-36) bodily pain and physical function scores and the modified Oswestry Disability Index at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and yearly up to 8 years.

Results

Data were obtained for 69% of the randomized cohort and 57% of the observational cohort at the 8-year follow up. Intent-to-treat analyses of the randomized group were limited by high levels of nonadherence to the randomized treatment. As-treated analyses in the randomized and observational groups showed significantly greater improvement in the surgery group on all primary outcome measures at all time points through 8 years. Outcomes were similar among patients treated with uninstrumented posterolateral fusion, instrumented posterolateral fusion, and 360° fusion.

Conclusion

For patients with symptomatic DS, patients who received surgery had significantly greater improvements in pain and function compared with nonoperative treatment through 8 years of follow-up. Fusion technique did not affect outcomes.

### What are long-term predictors of outcomes for lumbar disc herniation? A randomized and observational study [^117H3Gip]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Although previous studies have illustrated improvements in surgical cohorts for patients with intervertebral disc herniation, there are limited data on predictors of long-term outcomes comparing surgical and nonsurgical outcomes.

Questions/Purposes

We assessed outcomes of operative and nonoperative treatment for patients with intervertebral disc herniation and symptomatic radiculopathy at 8 years from the Spine Patient Outcomes Research Trial. We specifically examined subgroups to determine whether certain populations had a better long-term outcome with surgery or nonoperative treatment.

Methods

Patients with symptomatic lumbar radiculopathy for at least 6 weeks associated with nerve root irritation or neurologic deficit on examination and a confirmed disc herniation on cross-sectional imaging were enrolled at 13 different clinical sites. Patients consenting to participate in the randomized cohort were assigned to surgical or nonoperative treatment using variable permuted block randomization stratified by site. Those who declined randomization entered the observational cohort group based on treatment preference but were otherwise treated and followed identically to the randomized cohort. Of those in the randomized cohort, 309 of 501 (62%) provided 8-year data and in the observational group 469 of 743 (63%). Patients were treated with either surgical discectomy or usual nonoperative care. By 8 years, only 148 of 245 (60%) of those randomized to surgery had undergone surgery, whereas 122 of 256 (48%) of those randomized to nonoperative treatment had undergone surgery. The primary outcome measures were SF-36 bodily pain, SF-36 physical function, and Oswestry Disability Index collected at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, and then annually. Further analysis studied the following factors to determine if any were predictive of long-term outcomes: sex, herniation location, depression, smoking, work status, other joint problems, herniation level, herniation type, and duration of symptoms.

Results

The intent-to-treat analysis of the randomized cohort at 8 years showed no difference between surgical and nonoperative treatment for the primary outcome measures. Secondary outcome measures of sciatica bothersomeness, leg pain, satisfaction with symptoms, and self-rated improvement showed greater improvement in the group randomized to surgery despite high levels of crossover. The as-treated analysis of the combined randomized and observational cohorts, adjusted for potential confounders, showed advantages for surgery for all primary outcome measures; however, this has the potential for confounding from other unrecognized variables. Smokers and patients with depression or comorbid joint problems had worse functional outcomes overall (with surgery and nonoperative care) but similar surgical treatment effects. Patients with sequestered fragments, symptom duration greater than 6 months, those with higher levels of low back pain, or who were neither working nor disabled at baseline showed greater surgical treatment effects.

Conclusions

The intent-to-treat analysis, which is complicated by high rates of crossover, showed no difference over 8 years for primary outcomes of overall pain, physical function, and back-related disability but did show small advantages for secondary outcomes of sciatica bothersomeness, satisfaction with symptoms, and self-rated improvement. Subgroup analyses identified those groups with sequestered fragments on MRI, higher levels of baseline back pain accompanying radiculopathy, a longer duration of symptoms, and those who were neither working nor disabled at baseline with a greater relative advantage from surgery at 8 years.

### Preoperative sport improves the outcome of lumbar disc surgery: a prospective monocentric cohort study [^113UoHzn]. Neurosurgical Review (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

The authors present the first prospective clinical trial investigating the influence of preoperative sports on the patient's satisfaction and recovery after lumbar sequestrectomy. Disc surgery resulted in an overall significant improvement after 12-month follow-up, whereas patients doing preoperative sports on a regular basis showed a significantly better outcome. Leg and back pain 1 year after surgery was worse in the group of patients who did not perform preoperative regular sports. The differences found not only proved to be statistically significant, but also seem to be clinically relevant according to recent literature on the minimal clinical important difference.

A lumbar disc herniation prompting surgery may be an incisive event in a patient's everyday life. The patient's recovery and improvement of pain after lumbar spine surgery may be influenced by various factors.

The presence of depression might have a negative effect of the improvement after surgery. Patients with mental disorders were excluded from our trial. Thus, BDI scores did not differ between the two investigated groups and this could be ruled out as a confounding factor. Furthermore, gender plays an important role in patients with radiculopathy caused by a lumbar disc herniation, as female gender might influence the patient's pain perception in a negative way. The distribution of sexes was equal between our two study groups. Additionally, the surgical technique itself may be crucial for the patient's outcome after surgery. Sequestrectomy as the standard surgical technique in our department and invariably used in this trial previously demonstrated superior results than lumbar discectomy. Lower recurrent back pain and superior satisfactory rates were observed in the short- as well as long-term follow-up.

### Preoperative sport improves the outcome of lumbar disc surgery: a prospective monocentric cohort study [^111SSfdx]. Neurosurgical Review (2017). Low credibility.

A lumbar disc herniation resulting in surgery may be an incisive event in a patient's everyday life. The patient's recovery after sequestrectomy may be influenced by several factors. There is evidence that regular physical activity can lower pain perception and improve the outcome after surgery. For this purpose, we hypothesized that patients performing regular sports prior to lumbar disc surgery might have less pain perception and disability thereafter. Fifty-two participants with a single lumbar disc herniation confirmed on MRI treated by a lumbar sequestrectomy were included in the trial. They were categorized into two groups based on their self-reported level of physical activity prior to surgery: group NS, no regular physical activity and group S, with regular physical activity. Further evaluation included a detailed medical history, a physical examination, and various questionnaires: Visual Analog Scale (VAS), Beck-Depression-Inventory (BDI), Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), Core Outcome Measure Index (COMI), and the EuroQoL-5Dimension (EQ- 5D). Surgery had an excellent overall improvement of pain and disability (p < 0.005). The ODI, COMI, and EQ-5D differed 6 months after intervention (p < 0.05) favoring the sports group. Leg and back pain on VAS was also significantly less in group B than in group A, 12 months after surgery (p < 0.05). Preoperative regular physical activity is an important influencing factor for the overall satisfaction and disability after lumbar disc surgery. The importance of sports may have been underestimated for surgical outcomes.

### Guideline summary review: an evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis [^115DvQxu]. The Spine Journal (2016). Medium credibility.

Medical and interventional treatment — evidence status for degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis: An updated systematic review of the literature yielded no studies to adequately address any of the medical/interventional treatment questions from the original guideline, and due to the uncontrolled nonoperative protocol, lack of nonoperative treatment details and high treatment cross-over rate of the Spine Patient Outcomes Research Trial (SPORT) at 4 years, the work group is cautioned to use this trial as support for a recommendation for or against the role or long term effectiveness of medical/interventional treatment; however, given the paucity of nonoperative treatment evidence from the original and current guideline literature searches, the work group included the summary below as background information.

### Patient preferences and expectations for care: determinants in patients with lumbar intervertebral disc herniation [^1147d7qk]. Spine (2008). Low credibility.

Study Design

Prospective observational cohort.

Objective

To describe the baseline characteristics of patients with a diagnosis of intervertebral disc herniation who had different treatment preferences and the relationship of specific expectations with those preferences.

Summary Of Background Data

Data were gathered from the observational cohort of the Spine Patient Outcomes Research Trial (SPORT). Patients in the observational cohort met eligibility requirements identical to those of the randomized cohort, but declined randomization, receiving instead the treatment of their choice.

Methods

Baseline preference and expectation data were acquired at the time of enrollment of the patient, before exposure to the informed consent process. Univariate analyses were performed using a t test for continuous variables and chi for categorical variables. Multivariate analyses were also performed with ANCOVA for continuous variables and logistic regression for categorical variables. Multiple logistic regression models were developed in a forward stepwise fashion using blocks of variables.

Results

More patients preferred operative care: 67% preferred surgery, 28% preferred nonoperative treatment, and 6% were unsure; 53% of those preferring surgery stated a definite preference, whereas only 18% of those preferring nonoperative care had a definite preference. Patients preferring surgery were younger, had lower levels of education, and higher levels of unemployment/disability. This group also reported higher pain, worse physical and mental functioning, more back pain related disability, a longer duration of symptoms, and more opiate use. Gender, race, comorbidities, and use of other therapies did not differ significantly across preference groups. Patients' expectations regarding improvement with nonoperative care was the strongest predictor of preference.

Conclusion

Patient expectations, particularly regarding the benefit of nonoperative treatment, are the primary determinant of surgery preference among patients with lumbar intervertebral disc herniation. Demographic, functional status, and prior treatment experience had significant associations with patients' expectations and preferences.

### Preoperative sport improves the outcome of lumbar disc surgery: a prospective monocentric cohort study [^112KEGkc]. Neurosurgical Review (2017). Low credibility.

A lumbar disc herniation resulting in surgery may be an incisive event in a patient's everyday life. The patient's recovery after sequestrectomy may be influenced by several factors. There is evidence that regular physical activity can lower pain perception and improve the outcome after surgery. For this purpose, we hypothesized that patients performing regular sports prior to lumbar disc surgery might have less pain perception and disability thereafter. Fifty-two participants with a single lumbar disc herniation confirmed on MRI treated by a lumbar sequestrectomy were included in the trial. They were categorized into two groups based on their self-reported level of physical activity prior to surgery: group NS, no regular physical activity and group S, with regular physical activity. Further evaluation included a detailed medical history, a physical examination, and various questionnaires: Visual Analog Scale (VAS), Beck-Depression-Inventory (BDI), Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), Core Outcome Measure Index (COMI), and the EuroQoL-5Dimension (EQ- 5D). Surgery had an excellent overall improvement of pain and disability (p < 0.005). The ODI, COMI, and EQ-5D differed 6 months after intervention (p < 0.05) favoring the sports group. Leg and back pain on VAS was also significantly less in group B than in group A, 12 months after surgery (p < 0.05). Preoperative regular physical activity is an important influencing factor for the overall satisfaction and disability after lumbar disc surgery. The importance of sports may have been underestimated for surgical outcomes.

### Effects of viewing an evidence-based video decision aid on patients' treatment preferences for spine surgery [^115yQerY]. Spine (2011). Low credibility.

Study Design

Secondary analysis within a large clinical trial.

Objective

To evaluate the changes in treatment preference before and after watching a video decision aid as part of an informed consent process.

Summary Of Background Data

A randomized trial with a similar decision aid in herniated disc patients had shown decreased rate of surgery in the video group, but the effect of the video on expressed preferences is not known.

Methods

Subjects enrolling in the Spine Patient Outcomes Research Trial (SPORT) with intervertebral disc herniation, spinal stenosis, or degenerative spondylolisthesis at 13 multidisciplinary spine centers across the United States were given an evidence-based videotape decision aid viewed prior to enrollment as part of informed consent.

Results

Of the 2505 patients, 86% (n = 2151) watched the video and 14% (n = 354) did not. Watchers shifted their preference more often than nonwatchers (37.9% vs. 20.8%, P < 0.0001) and more often demonstrated a strengthened preference (26.2% vs. 11.1%, P < 0.0001). Among the 806 patients whose preference shifted after watching the video, 55% shifted toward surgery (P = 0.003). Among the 617 who started with no preference, after the video 27% preferred nonoperative care, 22% preferred surgery, and 51% remained uncertain.

Conclusion

After watching the evidence-based patient decision aid (video) used in SPORT, patients with specific lumbar spine disorders formed and/or strengthened their treatment preferences in a balanced way that did not appear biased toward or away from surgery.

### Crucial trials in neurosurgery: a must-know for every neurosurgeon [^113rYeVe]. Neurosurgical Review (2024). Medium credibility.

Myelomeningocele

MOMS

The Management of Myelomeningocele Study (MOMS), conducted in 2011, was a pivotal trial comparing prenatal versus postnatal repair of myelomeningocele, a common form of spina bifida. This study involved 183 patients, with outcomes evaluated in 158 patients at 12 months and 134 patients at 30 months. Key findings include that the prenatal surgery group showed a significant reduction in the need for cerebrospinal fluid shunt placement and improvements in several secondary outcomes, including hindbrain herniation, at 12 months. At 30 months, the prenatal surgery group demonstrated better motor outcomes and composite scores of mental development and motor function. Despite these benefits, prenatal surgery was associated with increased risks of preterm delivery and uterine dehiscence at delivery. These results indicate that prenatal surgery for myelomeningocele can reduce the need for shunting and improve motor outcomes but comes with maternal and fetal risks.

Spinal neurosurgery

SPORT 2006

The Spine Patient Outcomes Research Trial (SPORT) of 2006 was a pivotal study in spinal neurosurgery, focusing on the treatment of lumbar disk herniation. Conducted across 13 medical centers in the United States, the trial included 743 patients, who chose between standard open diskectomy (surgery) and usual nonoperative care. The trial's goal was to assess the effectiveness of these treatments in improving symptoms of radiculopathy secondary to lumbar disk herniation. Patients in both treatment groups experienced substantial improvement over time, but those who underwent surgery reported significantly greater improvements. The benefits of surgery were noticeable as early as 6 weeks and were sustained for at least two years. This suggests that surgery offers a more rapid and possibly more effective treatment for symptoms of lumbar disk herniation, especially in terms of pain relief and physical function. Importantly, the study's findings emphasize the clinical significance of changes observed in quality-of-life measures. The SPORT results, particularly from the observational cohort, exceeded the thresholds for clinically important differences in scales like the SF-36 subscales and the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), reinforcing the relevance and impact of the surgical intervention in real-world settings. Overall, the SPORT Trial provides crucial insights into the management of lumbar disk herniation, underlining the effectiveness of surgical intervention, especially in cases where rapid symptom relief and improvement in quality of life are priorities. The study also highlights the importance of patient choice and individualized treatment approaches in managing lumbar disk herniation.

### Preoperative sport improves the outcome of lumbar disc surgery: a prospective monocentric cohort study [^115euuDU]. Neurosurgical Review (2017). Low credibility.

In summary, regular exercise may positively influence regeneration of a disc degeneration early in the degenerative cascade by enabling a better disc nutrition. It may be important that our patients were no professional athletes, as over-exercise may accelerate disc degeneration.

Obviously, the treating surgeon cannot influence the patients' baseline characteristics, namely preoperative physical activity and preoperative sports will not have an impact on surgical indications. Nevertheless, our results indicate that resumption or adoption of physical activity after disc surgery may be encouraged. Plus, the data support health promotion programs, which have gained popularity in the last decades to reduce health-related expenses by alleviating musculoskeletal pain.

A recurrent lumbar disc herniation is the most prevalent cause for postoperative radicular pain. Rates quoted range from 3 to 19% with the higher rates usually in series with a longer follow-up. Multiple risk factors for recurrent disc herniations exist and are discussed controversially. Beneath young age, severe disc degeneration, traumatic events and gender seems to play a major role for the development of a recurrent disc herniation. There was a trend towards higher reherniation rates in the NS group in our study. Large anular defects have been associated with higher reherniation rates and technical nuances particularly concerning aggressiveness of disc removal also influence reherniation. Our department's standard operating procedure involves pure sequestrectomy in absence of a clear anular defect and limited discectomy in case of larger anular defects, so that there were no differences in surgical technique between groups. The sizes of the anular defects were not assessed in our study, but could have influenced the results. We postulate, however, that regular sports might even reduce the risk of recurrent disc herniations. Obviously, larger comparative studies are needed to confirm these findings.

Strengths of our study include the use of the validated, standardized comprehensive questionnaires like ODI, COMI or EQ-5D. Furthermore, we are able to present a homogenous study population, while we excluded individuals with major depression or chronic pain/neurological disorders. However, the small patient cohort is a limitation that might have introduced selection bias. The assessment of physical activity in our trial was based on self-reported values. This may have led to over-reporting of quality and quantity of physical activity. Therefore, data would be more accurate when using activity measuring devices like an actigraph.

### Short-term outcome of conservative treatment in athletes with symptomatic lumbar disc herniation [^112vd8DF]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to clarify the efficacy of conservative treatment in athletes with symptomatic lumbar disc herniation, especially in terms of their ability to return to their original sporting activities.

Design

A total of 71 consecutive athletes (53 men and 18 women), who consulted our sports medicine clinic during the 10-yr period between September 1993 and October 2003 because of severe low back pain or leg pain/numbness due to lumbar disc herniation (confirmed on magnetic resonance images), were studied. The mean age of the subjects was 21 yrs. All of them were conservatively treated by advising them to discontinue their sporting activities, with or without short-term medication. After the subjective symptoms had reduced by > 80%, individual training was started to allow the athletes to return to their original sporting activities.

Results

A total of 56 athletes (78.9%) could return to their original sporting activities at an average of 4.7 mos (range, 1–12 mos) after the start of treatment and were able to sustain the activities for ≥ 6 mos, the minimum duration of follow-up in this study. The outcome of the conservative treatment was not influenced by the intensity of the sporting activity. Multiple logistic regression analyses showed that the only factor influencing the ability of the athletes to return to their original sporting activities was the severity of the symptoms before the start of treatment.

Conclusion

The results of this study suggest that the short-term outcome of conservative treatment in athletes with symptomatic lumbar disc herniation may be satisfactory in terms of control of the symptoms and the ability of the athletes to return to their original sporting activities and that the subjective symptoms before treatment may be a key factor influencing the success of the conservative management. Randomized controlled trials, or even comparative follow-up studies, are needed to confirm our results.

### How does accounting for worker productivity affect the measured cost-effectiveness of lumbar discectomy? [^112qMt2v]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

With the majority of inpatient disc herniation surgeries performed on working-aged individuals, successful treatment of lumbar disc herniation has the potential to yield substantial benefits in terms of employee productivity. In the 2008 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), an estimated 10.5 million people reported having back problems with radiating leg pain. On average, this population reported spending 34 days in bed, and missing 26 workdays in the prior 12 months (among respondents with a work history). In another study, back pain was estimated to cause an average of 5.3 hours of lost productive time at work per week with most of that lost time the result of reduced performance.

Surgical treatment of lumbar disc herniation has been shown to be cost-effective. For example, the Spine Patient Outcomes Research Trial (SPORT), a prospective multicenter study, showed improved clinical outcomes (pain, physical function, and disability) for patients who had surgery for lumbar disc herniation relative to nonsurgical treatment. During a 4-year period, lumbar disc herniation was found to be cost-effective in the pooled randomized and observational cohorts at an incremental cost of $43,800 per additional quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) with surgical treatment priced at estimated private-payer levels. The SPORT findings are consistent with those of other studies that have shown that surgery for disc herniation produces better outcomes than nonsurgical treatment. However, prior studies have not taken into account improvements in worker productivity as a result of surgery for lumbar disc herniation, and as such, likely have underestimated the cost-effectiveness of this intervention.

The purpose of our study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of lumbar disc herniation surgery after accounting for its affect on worker productivity. The research addressed two questions. First, we examined the affect of surgery on workers' productivity using data from SPORT (based on the pooled randomized and observation cohorts analyzed on an as-treated basis) and the NHIS. Second, we assessed how the inclusion of these factors influenced the cost-effectiveness of surgical treatment for lumbar disc herniation.

Automated or endoscopic percutaneous discectomy versus conventional discectomy — randomized trial (n = 34) found no statistical difference between groups; primary outcome success was 41% in the automated/endoscopic group and 40% in the conventional group, with significant improvement in secondary outcomes at six months. Due to sample and design limitations, this Level II patient trial provides Level III evidence that outcomes are comparable at six months, and offers Level IV evidence about the efficacy of automated or endoscopic discectomy.

### Preoperative sport improves the outcome of lumbar disc surgery: a prospective monocentric cohort study [^1151ui6H]. Neurosurgical Review (2017). Low credibility.

Nevertheless, the influence of regular preoperative physical activity on postoperative outcome has not yet been investigated prospectively. Few studies could show that physiotherapy improves the patients' reported outcome and healthcare consumption after surgery. In general, there is evidence that a higher amount of physical activity is associated with less low back pain. Endurance exercise for example, as preferred sports in our trial, is known to promote antinociceptive effects more likely on central processing rather than on peripheral pain. It has to be kept in mind, however, that not only physical activity prior to surgery but as well thereafter may have an impact on surgical outcome. This can be within a rehabilitation program or by resuming preoperative sports. While postoperative rehabilitation did not differ between groups in our study, it is likely that preoperatively active patients resumed their activity postoperatively, which may be even more important for their respective outcome. Although sports on a regular basis seem to reduce pain perception, it does not decrease the risk to develop a lumbar disc herniation as the disc degeneration itself is multifaceted and traditionally attributed to age, mechanical loading, gender, trauma, and other factors impairing disc nutrition. Furthermore, a higher prevalence of structural abnormalities was reported in adolescent athletes compared to adolescent non-athletes, whereas an association to disc degeneration was not found. Disc degeneration grades in our study population were equally distributed in the two investigated groups. On the contrary, Modic changes were less in the sports group. It could be speculated that regular physical activity may have a positive effect on disc and endplate nutrition resulting in less Modic changes in contrast to the mentioned negative effect of excessive exercise in adolescent athletes. The impact of Modic changes on postoperative clinical outcome, especially low back pain, however, is still a matter of debate, although an association with patient satisfaction has been reported. These radiological differences between groups might explain some of the differences in clinical outcome.

### Chemonucleolysis for lumbar disc herniation: history and current state of the technology [^1128GnDV]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

First-line treatment for LDH-associated radicular leg pain is conservative management with pharmacologic approaches (eg, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs], gabapentin, opioids) and nonpharmacological treatments such as rest and physical therapy. LDH symptoms will resolve spontaneously or with conservative management in the vast majority (90%) of cases. Epidural steroid injections (ESIs) provide short-term pain relief but negligible long-term benefits, and are not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

Patients whose LDH symptoms do not respond to conservative therapy are often recommended for surgery. While discectomy is an effective procedure to decompress the spinal nerves and relieve LDH symptoms, the benefits of surgery on leg pain and disability have been shown to diminish over time. In addition, surgery is associated with risks of intraoperative complications (eg, dural tear) and long-term consequences, such as pain recurrence, reherniation, and revision discectomy. A follow-up to the Spine Patient Outcomes Research Trial (SPORT) and 2 meta-analysis have observed that prolonged LDH symptom duration (> 6 months) is associated with worse pain and functional outcomes (ie, shorter duration, more positive outcomes) with or without surgery. This reported adverse effect of longer symptom duration on outcomes suggests that timely treatment of persistent radicular pain may benefit patients with LDH.

### Effectiveness of microdiscectomy for lumbar disc herniation: a randomized controlled trial with 2 years of follow-up [^115zjCto]. Spine (2006). Low credibility.

Study Design

Prospective randomized controlled trial.

Objective

To assess effectiveness of microdiscectomy in lumbar disc herniation patients with 6 to 12 weeks of symptoms but no absolute indication for surgery.

Summary Of Background Data

There is limited evidence in favor of discectomy for prolonged symptoms of lumbar disc herniation. However, only one randomized trial has directly compared discectomy with conservative treatment.

Methods

Fifty-six patients (age range, 20–50 years) with a lumbar disc herniation, clinical findings of nerve root compression, and radicular pain lasting 6 to 12 weeks were randomized to microdiscectomy or conservative management. Fifty patients (89%) were available at the 2-year follow-up. Leg pain intensity was the primary outcome measure.

Results

There were no clinically significant differences between the groups in leg or back pain intensity, subjective disability, or health-related quality of life over the 2-year follow-up, although discectomy seemed to be associated with a more rapid initial recovery. In a subgroup analysis, discectomy was superior to conservative treatment when the herniation was at L4-L5.

Conclusions

Lumbar microdiscectomy offered only modest short-term benefits in patients with sciatica due to disc extrusion or sequester. Spinal level of the herniation may be an important factor modifying effectiveness of surgery, but this hypothesis needs verification.

### Preoperative sport improves the outcome of lumbar disc surgery: a prospective monocentric cohort study [^113nMpqV]. Neurosurgical Review (2017). Low credibility.

Results

Fifty-two consecutive patients met the inclusion criteria and could be enrolled in the trial. By chance, they were divided symmetrically into patients with regular physical activity (group S; n = 26) and those without (group NS; n = 26). The loss to postoperative 6-month follow-up was 1.9% and to 12-month follow-up was 3.8%. A recurrent disc herniation occurred in six (23%) patients in group NS and in three (11.5%) patients in group S (p = 0.465). An accidental durotomy occurred in one patient in group NS. These patients were excluded from further statistical analysis, as these factors could have influenced the outcome data.

The preoperative demographic data is described in Table 1. The most common Pfirrmann grade was IV° in both groups and there was not statistically significant difference between groups. 80.7% of group NS and 46.1% of group S showed Modic changes in MRI (p = 0.006). There were no significant differences in total muscle size or fatty degeneration (p > 0.05). Study participants preferred sports with high dynamic and moderate intensity (see Fig. 1).

### A pilot study for effectiveness of non-pharmacological versus pharmacological treatment strategies for lumbar disc herniation: a pragmatic randomized controlled trial [^1146emVg]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Based on the baseline characteristics of the 30 participants in this study, 40% were recommended for spinal surgery, 30% showed extrusion or sequestrated discs on MRI findings, and the NRS score for radiating leg pain was approximately 7 points, indicating that patients with severe LDH participated in this clinical trial. Additionally, the onset median value of the patients was 53 months in both groups, indicating many patients with chronic conditions of LDH.

The changes in the NRS score of radiating leg pain during the 8-week intervention period showed gradual improvement in both groups, but the improvement in the Phm group tended to be slightly greater. However, in the Phm group, the pain worsened at Week 14 and then improved again. Accordingly, at Week 14 in the follow-up period, the improvement in the Non-Phm group was significantly greater. Looking at the minimal clinically important differences (MCID) for major outcomes, there were previous studies where the MCID for NRS of back pain ranged from 1 to 2.3, and for NRS of leg pain ranged from 1 to 1.6 and ODI ranged from 10 to 12.8. In this study, at Week 14, the difference in NRS of leg pain between the two groups was 1.65 (95% CI 0.59 to 2.71), and the difference in ODI was 8.67 (95% CI 1.37 to 15.98). Therefore, the difference in NRS is judged to be a significant difference beyond the MCID between the two groups, and the ODI difference is also judged to be large, ranging from 67% to 87% of the MCID.

### Nonsurgical treatment choices by individuals with lumbar intervertebral disc herniation in the United States: associations with long-term outcomes [^114LgrpR]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2017). Low credibility.

Objectives

The objectives of this study were to (1) evaluate differences between patients with lumbar intervertebral disc herniation who received physical therapy (PT) and those who did not; (2) identify factors associated with receiving PT; and (3) examine the influence of PT on clinical outcomes over the course of 1 yr.

Design

An observational cohort study using data from the Spine Patient Outcomes Research Trial was conducted. This study included 363 patients with intervertebral disc herniation who received nonsurgical management within 6 wks of enrollment. Baseline characteristics were compared between patients who received PT and those who did not. Multivariate logistic regression examined factors predictive of patients receiving PT. Mixed effects models were used to compare primary outcomes (Short-Form Survey 36 bodily pain and physical function and modified Oswestry Index) at 3 and 6 mos and 1 yr after enrollment.

Results

Forty percent of the nonsurgical cohort received PT. Higher disability scores, neurological deficit, and patient preference predicted PT use. Compared with other nonsurgical management strategies, standard care PT was not associated with a significant difference in pain, disability, or surgery over 1 yr.

Conclusions

Many patients with intervertebral disc herniation seek secondary care for persisting symptoms and pursue nonsurgical management. The best management strategy is unclear and further research is needed to examine appropriate sequencing and selection of treatment.

### An evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy [^114K8qew]. The Spine Journal (2014). Medium credibility.

Randomized and observational cohorts comparing surgery and medical/interventional care — Weinstein et al conducted a prospective randomized controlled trial including 1244 patients; in the randomized group there were 245 surgically treated patients and 256 medical/interventional patients, and in the observational cohort 521 were treated surgically and 222 medically/interventionally. Outcomes were assessed at two years and four years, there was 30% crossover from the medical/interventional group, and at three months, one year, two years and four years the intent-to-treat analysis favored surgery; however, because of large crossover and less than 80% follow-up, conclusions about superiority or equivalence were not warranted, and this potential Level I study provides Level II therapeutic evidence that up to four years patients severe enough to warrant surgery enjoy substantial benefits compared to medical/interventional patients.

### Preoperative sport improves the outcome of lumbar disc surgery: a prospective monocentric cohort study [^115KbT4f]. Neurosurgical Review (2017). Low credibility.

Surgical procedures

Surgery was performed after induction of general endotracheal anesthesia and with the assistance of an operating microscope (Pentero, Carl Zeiss Co.) while the patient was in a prone position, by two surgeons in a standardized manner. The spinal canal harboring the sequestrated disc material was exposed by performing a minimal interlaminar fenestration. Based on results of previous trials, only the herniated material was removed and the herniated space was not entered. Intraoperative problems such as surgery-related complications and postoperative complications like re-operations, recurrent disc herniations, infection, or bleeding were recorded, and these patients were excluded from further analyses to minimize heterogeneity of the cohort.

Statistical analysis

All values were expressed as mean ± SD. The Kolmogorov–Smirnov test was used for testing normal distribution. The unpaired Student's t test, Mann–Whitney U test, and Fisher's exact test were used to analyze differences in clinical and demographic characteristics and in clinical outcome variables. A p value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. All statistical evaluations were performed with SPSS Version 21.0 (IBM Corp. Released 2012. IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 21.0, NY: IBM Corp.). Figures were designed using GraphPad Prism (version 5.0 for Mac OS X, GraphPad Software, La Jolla California USA).

### Indications for spine surgery: validation of an administrative coding algorithm to classify degenerative diagnoses [^114Wzd4C]. Spine (2014). Low credibility.

Study Design

Retrospective analysis of Medicare claims linked to a multicenter clinical trial.

Objective

The Spine Patient Outcomes Research Trial (SPORT) provided a unique opportunity to examine the validity of a claims-based algorithm for grouping patients by surgical indication. SPORT enrolled patients for lumbar disc herniation, spinal stenosis, and degenerative spondylolisthesis. We compared the surgical indication derived from Medicare claims with that provided by SPORT surgeons, the "gold standard".

Summary Of Background Data

Administrative data are frequently used to report procedure rates, surgical safety outcomes, and costs in the management of spinal surgery. However, the accuracy of using diagnosis codes to classify patients by surgical indication has not been examined.

Methods

Medicare claims were link to beneficiaries enrolled in SPORT. The sensitivity and specificity of 3 claims-based approaches to group patients on the basis of surgical indications were examined: (1) using the first listed diagnosis; (2) using all diagnoses independently; and (3) using a diagnosis hierarchy on the basis of the support for fusion surgery.

Results

Medicare claims were obtained from 376 SPORT participants, including 21 with disc herniation, 183 with spinal stenosis, and 172 with degenerative spondylolisthesis. The hierarchical coding algorithm was the most accurate approach for classifying patients by surgical indication, with sensitivities of 76.2%, 88.1%, and 84.3% for disc herniation, spinal stenosis, and degenerative spondylolisthesis cohorts, respectively. The specificity was 98.3% for disc herniation, 83.2% for spinal stenosis, and 90.7% for degenerative spondylolisthesis. Misclassifications were primarily due to codes attributing more complex pathology to the case.

Conclusion

Standardized approaches for using claims data to group patients accurately by surgical indications have widespread interest. We found that a hierarchical coding approach correctly classified more than 90% of spine patients into their respective SPORT cohorts. Therefore, claims data seem to be a reasonably valid approach to classifying patients by surgical indication.

### An evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy [^114ZsUHR]. The Spine Journal (2014). Medium credibility.

Levels of evidence and grades of recommendation (NASS) define how study quality informs recommendation wording and strength. Levels of evidence range from Level I (high quality randomized controlled trial) to Level V (expert consensus), and levels are assigned to studies prior to developing recommendations; recommendations are then graded based on the level of evidence. Grades of Recommendation pair evidence tiers with language: A uses Level I studies with consistent findings and the recommendation wording "is recommended"; B uses Level II or III studies with consistent findings and the wording "suggest"; C uses Level IV or V studies and indicates a test or intervention "may be considered" or "is an option"; I denotes insufficient or conflicting evidence and states that "there is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against". The guideline notes that significant shortcomings in study execution can downgrade a study's potential level of evidence.

### Do epidural injections provide short-and long-term relief for lumbar disc herniation? A systematic review [^117DuHXd]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2015). Low credibility.

Background

As part of a comprehensive nonsurgical approach, epidural injections often are used in the management of lumbar disc herniation. Recent guidelines and systematic reviews have reached different conclusions about the efficacy of epidural injections in managing lumbar disc herniation.

Questions/Purposes

In this systematic review, we determined the efficacy (pain relief and functional improvement) of the three anatomic approaches (caudal, lumbar interlaminar, and transforaminal) for epidural injections in the treatment of disc herniation.

Methods

We performed a literature search from 1966 to June 2013 in PubMed, Cochrane library, US National Guideline Clearinghouse, previous systematic reviews, and cross-references for trials studying all types of epidural injections in managing chronic or chronic and subacute lumbar disc herniation. We wanted only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (either placebo or active controlled) to be included in our analysis, and 66 studies found in our search fulfilled these criteria. We then assessed the methodologic quality of these 66 studies using the Cochrane review criteria for RCTs. Thirty-nine studies were excluded, leaving 23 RCTs of high and moderate methodologic quality for analysis. Evidence for the efficacy of all three approaches for epidural injection under fluoroscopy was strong for short-term (< 6 months) and moderate for long-term (≥ 6 months) based on the Cochrane rating system with five levels of evidence (best evidence synthesis), with strong evidence denoting consistent findings among multiple high-quality RCTs and moderate evidence denoting consistent findings among multiple low-quality RCTs or one high-quality RCT. The primary outcome measure was pain relief, defined as at least 50% improvement in pain or 3-point improvement in pain scores in at least 50% of the patients. The secondary outcome measure was functional improvement, defined as 50% reduction in disability or 30% reduction in the disability scores.

Results

Based on strong evidence for short-term efficacy from multiple high-quality trials and moderate evidence for long-term efficacy from at least one high quality trial, we found that fluoroscopic caudal, lumbar interlaminar, and transforaminal epidural injections were efficacious at managing lumbar disc herniation in terms of pain relief and functional improvement.

Conclusions

The available evidence suggests that epidural injections performed under fluoroscopy by trained physicians offer improvement in pain and function in well-selected patients with lumbar disc herniation.

Spinal manipulation as an alternative to discectomy — evidence statement and trial data: There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against the use of spinal manipulation as an alternative to discectomy in patients with lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy whose symptoms warrant surgery. Grade of Recommendation: I (Insufficient Evidence). In a prospective randomized controlled trial, twenty patients were assigned to each treatment group, and outcomes were assessed at one year; sixty percent of patients treated with manipulation and 85% of surgically treated patients improved at 12 weeks, and there was no difference in the intent-to-treat analysis at one year.

Lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy — cost-effectiveness of surgical options is supported, with microdiscectomy showing favorable value across multiple analyses; the committee "felt that there was strong and consistent evidence supporting the cost effectiveness of microdiscectomy for patients with symptomatic lumbar disc herniation who desired surgical treatment". In the SPORT cohort, Tosteson et al evaluated outcomes "at two and four years", finding that "at two years, lumbar discectomy compared to nonsurgical management was felt to be cost effective with a cost per QALY of between $35,000 and $70,000 depending upon the payer", and with continued follow-up "the cost per QALY of surgical intervention dropped to approximately $20,000 per QALY". In a prospective registry of "1822 workers", Hansson et al "estimated the cost per QALY of surgical intervention to be $4,648.00 and reported that surgical treatment had better cost utility than nonsurgical treatment". Malter et al reported that microdiscectomy was cost effective "with an estimated cost per QALY of $12,000–$30,000 depending upon the payer".

### Lumbar discectomy outcomes vary by herniation level in the spine patient outcomes research trial [^114fWWAQ]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2008). Low credibility.

Background

The Spine Patient Outcomes Research Trial showed an overall advantage for operative compared with nonoperative treatment of lumbar disc herniations. Because a recent randomized trial showed no benefit for operative treatment of a disc at the lumbosacral junction (L5-S1), we reviewed subgroups within the Spine Patient Outcomes Research Trial to assess the effect of herniation level on outcomes of operative and nonoperative care.

Methods

The combined randomized and observation cohorts of the Spine Patient Outcomes Research Trial were analyzed by actual treatment received stratified by level of disc herniation. Overall, 646 L5-S1 herniations, 456 L4-L5 herniations, and eighty-eight upper lumbar (L2-L3 or L3-L4) herniations were evaluated. Primary outcome measures were the Short Form-36 bodily pain and physical functioning scales and the modified Oswestry Disability Index assessed at six weeks, three months, six months, one year, and two years. Treatment effects (the improvement in the operative group minus the improvement in the nonoperative group) were estimated with use of longitudinal regression models, adjusting for important covariates.

Results

At two years, patients with upper lumbar herniations (L2-L3 or L3-L4) showed a significantly greater treatment effect from surgery than did patients with L5-S1 herniations for all outcome measures: 24.6 and 7.1, respectively, for bodily pain (p = 0.002); 23.4 and 9.9 for Short Form-36 physical functioning (p = 0.014); and -19 and -10.3 for Oswestry Disability Index (p = 0.033). There was a trend toward greater treatment effect for surgery at L4-L5 compared with L5-S1, but this was significant only for the Short Form-36 physical functioning subscale (p = 0.006). Differences in treatment effects between the upper lumbar levels and L4-L5 were significant for Short Form-36 bodily pain only (p = 0.018).

Conclusions

The advantage of operative compared with nonoperative treatment varied by herniation level, with the smallest treatment effects at L5-S1, intermediate effects at L4-L5, and the largest effects at L2-L3 and L3-L4. This difference in effect was mainly a result of less improvement in patients with upper lumbar herniations after nonoperative treatment.

### An evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy [^116bvFkG]. The Spine Journal (2014). Medium credibility.

Lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy — comparative outcomes of surgery versus manipulation and research needs are noted: Manipulation "responded as well to treatment as surgically treated patients at 12 weeks", yet "because of the small sample size, along with the significant crossover and lack of a metaanalysis, this potential Level I study provides Level II therapeutic evidence that short-term outcomes in patients with lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy may be superior in surgically treated patients compared to patients treated with manipulation". For future research, "in the absence of clinical equipoise, it is impractical to demand additional randomized controlled trials comparing surgical intervention to 'usual nonoperative care'. Randomized controlled trials focusing on specific alternative treatments may be useful to identify effective alternatives to surgical intervention".

### Preoperative sport improves the outcome of lumbar disc surgery: a prospective monocentric cohort study [^112GFMqo]. Neurosurgical Review (2017). Low credibility.

Material and methods

Subjects

The prospective study was purely observational, and there were no recommendations for additional diagnostic measures or interventions. Pain management was not delayed or altered by participation in this study. All subjects gave their informed consent. The study was approved by the Local Ethics Committee in accordance with the ethical principles originating from the Declaration of Helsinki and in compliance with Good Clinical Practice. Consecutive patients were considered for inclusion, if they had a single-level disc herniation confirmed on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). All patients had an indication for sequestrectomy according to the guidelines of the German Society of Neurosurgery (DGNC) and the German Society of Orthopedics and Orthopedic Surgery (DGOOC). All participants were on best medical pain treatment, but sufficient pain relief was not achieved. No previous back surgery had been performed in any of the patients. None of the included patients had a history of peripheral nervous system disorders like metabolic or toxic damage of peripheral nerves. The patients were categorized into two groups based on their self-reported level of physical activity prior to surgery: group NS, no regular physical activity and group S, with regular daily to weekly physical activity. The type of sport was also documented and classified according to the classification of the American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology. This classification is based on the dynamic and static intensity: dynamic component: A (low) < 50%, B (moderate) 50–75%, and C (high) > 75%; static component: I (low) < 10%, II (moderate) 10–20%, and III (high) > 30%. According to our local standard of care, all patients received a postoperative rehabilitation program starting 4 weeks after sequestrectomy, which consisted of eight sessions lasting 45 min each.

### The contribution of RCTs to quality management and their feasibility in practice [^114qzPvA]. European Spine Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Conclusion

The RCTs are increasingly applied to improve the quality of spine surgery. At the same time new methods that have not been evaluated by RCTs are introduced for the treatment of spinal disorders. While recent RCTs document the faster relief for old surgical methods such as discectomy for the treatment of lumbar disc herniation in patients with sciatica and suggest reduced pain after decompression in spinal stenosis, the evidence for more sophisticated methods are conflicting or limited. Implementation of new methods should be based on sound evidence. This is important for the reputation of spine surgery and for the patient complaining from a spinal disorder in the hands of a spine surgeon.

Lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy — structured exercise and physical therapy evidence indicates mixed findings. A potential Level I study provides Level II therapeutic evidence that four weeks of lumbar stabilization exercises result in decreased pain and improved function in patients with lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy. A prospective randomized controlled trial evaluating physical therapy after selective nerve root blocks (SNRB) versus SNRBs alone included 44 patients, of whom 21 received SNRB in combination with physical therapy and the remaining 23 received only SNRBs, with outcomes assessed at six months. Intention-to-treat and as-treated analyses showed no significant difference between groups, and the authors concluded that physical therapy interventions after SNRBs were not more beneficial than SNRBs alone. Due to the small sample size, this study provides Level III therapeutic evidence that supervised exercise interventions intended to reduce symptoms after selective nerve root blocks were no more beneficial than selective nerve root blocks alone.

### Rehabilitation after lumbar disc surgery [^1174Ntno]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Although several rehabilitation programs, physical fitness programs or protocols regarding instruction for patients to return to work after lumbar disc surgery have been suggested, little is known about the efficacy and effectiveness of these treatments. There are still persistent fears of causing re-injury, re-herniation, or instability.

Objectives

The objective of this systematic review was to evaluate the effectiveness of active treatments that are used in the rehabilitation after first-time lumbar disc surgery.

Search Strategy

We searched the MEDLINE, EMBASE and Psyclit databases up to April 2000 and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register 2001, Issue 3.

Selection Criteria

Both randomized and non-randomized controlled trials on any type of active rehabilitation program after first-time disc surgery were included.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two independent reviewers performed the inclusion of studies and two other reviewers independently performed the methodological quality assessment. A rating system that consists of four levels of scientific evidence summarizes the results.

Main Results

Thirteen studies were included, six of which were of high quality. There is no strong evidence for the effectiveness for any treatment starting immediately post-surgery, mainly because of lack of (good quality) studies. For treatments that start four to six weeks post-surgery there is strong evidence (level 1) that intensive exercise programs are more effective on functional status and faster return to work (short-term follow-up) as compared to mild exercise programs and there is strong evidence (level 1) that on long term follow up there is no difference between intensive exercise programs and mild exercise programs with regard to overall improvement. For all other primary outcome measures for the comparison between intensive and mild exercise programs there is conflicting evidence (level 3) with regard to long-term follow-up. Furthermore, there is no strong evidence for the effectiveness of supervised training as compared to home exercises. There was also no strong evidence for the effectiveness of multidisciplinary rehabilitation as compared to usual care. There is limited evidence (level 3) that treatments in working populations that aim at return to work are more effective than usual care with regard to return to work. Also, there is limited evidence (level 3) that low-tech and high-tech exercises, started more than 12 months post-surgery are more effective in improving low back functional status as compared to physical agents, joint manipulations or no treatment. Finally, there is no strong evidence for the effectiveness of any specific intervention when added to an exercise program, regardless of whether exercise programs start immediately post-surgery or later. None of the investigated treatments seem harmful with regard to re-herniation or re-operation.

Reviewer's Conclusions

There is no evidence that patients need to have their activities restricted after first time lumbar disc surgery. There is strong evidence for intensive exercise programs (at least if started about 4–6 weeks post-operative) on short term for functional status and faster return to work and there is no evidence they increase the re-operation rate. It is unclear what the exact content of post-surgery rehabilitation should be. Moreover, there are no studies that investigated whether active rehabilitation programs should start immediately post-surgery or possibly four to six weeks later.

### Preoperative sport improves the outcome of lumbar disc surgery: a prospective monocentric cohort study [^1142g7h9]. Neurosurgical Review (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Our data suggests that preoperative regular physical activity is an important influencing factor on the overall satisfaction and disability after lumbar disc surgery. It potentially has the capacity to reduce not only low back pain, but also leg pain after sequestrectomy. Therefore and because of many more health advantages humans may gain, physical activity should be an essential element in everyday's life. The importance of sports may have been underestimated for surgical outcomes in general.

### An evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis (update) [^111Pw1tF]. The Spine Journal (2013). Medium credibility.

Degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis — surgical decompression versus medical/interventional care: Decompressive surgery is suggested to improve outcomes in patients with moderate to severe symptoms of lumbar spinal stenosis (Grade of Recommendation: B). In a prospective comparative study, of the 125 patients included, 96 were treated surgically and 29 opted for medical/interventional treatment, and at two-year follow-up the average improvement in Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ) scores for decompression, decompression with fusion and medical/interventional treatment were 6.9, 6.1 and 1.2 respectively; this provides Level II therapeutic evidence that patients considered surgical candidates who elect surgery have improvements greater than those electing medical/interventional treatment. In a randomized controlled trial of moderate lumbar spinal stenosis, of the 94 patients included, 50 received decompression and 44 individualized medical/interventional therapy; both groups improved during follow-up of one and two years, with greater improvement in the surgical group for disability, leg pain and back pain, walking ability did not differ, and the authors conclude that surgery should be suggested, but only after a trial of medical/interventional treatment. In the SPORT study, of the 654 patients included, 289 remained in the randomized controlled trial and 365 in the observational cohort; an as-treated analysis of 235 medical/interventional patients and 419 surgical patients showed a significant advantage for surgery for all primary outcomes, with changes significant at two years and maintained through four years; at four year follow-up, the medically/interventionally treated group "demonstrated only modest improvement over time", while in the surgical group 9% experienced dural tear and there was a 13% reoperation rate; collectively, these studies provide Level II therapeutic evidence that surgically treated patients maintain substantially greater improvement in pain and function through four years.

### A randomized, double-blind, active-control trial of the effectiveness of lumbar interlaminar epidural injections in disc herniation [^111o6kcF]. Pain Physician (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Among the multiple nonsurgical modalities, epidural injections are one of the most commonly utilized treatment modalities in managing chronic low back and lower extremity pain due to disc herniation and radiculitis. There is a paucity of randomized trials from contemporary interventional pain management settings utilizing fluoroscopy with long-term follow-up.

Study Design

Randomized, double-blind, active-controlled trial with 2-year follow-up.

Setting

An interventional pain management practice in the United States.

Objective

The objective was to assess the effectiveness of lumbar interlaminar epidural injections of local anesthetic with or without steroids for managing chronic low back pain of disc herniation or radiculitis.

Methods

Two groups of patients were studied, with 60 patients in each group receiving either local anesthetic only or local anesthetic mixed with betamethasone.

Outcome Measures

The primary outcome measure was defined as pain relief and functional status improvement of 50%. The outcomes were assessed by numeric rating scale (NRS) of pain and functional status with Oswestry Disability Index (ODI). Secondary outcome measures included employment status and opioid intake.

Results

Results showed significant improvement in 60% of patients in Group I and 70% of patients in Group II at the end of 2 years. In addition, in the successful groups, those with at least 3 weeks of relief (with the first 2 procedures), the improvement was 72% in Group I and 71% in Group II. Results were somewhat superior for pain relief at 6 months and functional status at 12 months in the steroid group. Thus, the results indicate that a patient's failure to respond to local anesthetic alone, may be treated with addition of steroids.

Limitations

The results of the study are limited by the lack of a placebo group.

Conclusion

Lumbar interlaminar epidural injections of local anesthetic with or without steroids is an effective modality, in patients with chronic function limiting low back and lower extremity pain secondary to disc herniation after failure of conservative modalities.

### The effectiveness of lumbar interlaminar epidural injections in managing chronic low back and lower extremity pain [^114bNqS5]. Pain Physician (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Intervertebral disc herniation, spinal stenosis, intervertebral disc degeneration without disc herniation, and post lumbar surgery syndrome are the most common diagnoses of chronic persistent low back and lower extremity symptoms, resulting in significant economic, societal, and health care impact. Epidural injections are one of the most commonly performed interventions in the United States in managing chronic low back pain. However the evidence is highly variable among different techniques utilized - namely interlaminar, caudal, and transforaminal - and for various conditions, namely - intervertebral disc herniation, spinal stenosis, and discogenic pain without disc herniation or radiculitis. Multiple systematic reviews conducted in the evaluation of the effectiveness of interlaminar epidural injections have been marred with controversy. Consequently, the debate continues with regards to the effectiveness, indications, and medical necessity of interlaminar epidural injections.

Study Design

A systematic review of lumbar interlaminar epidural injections with or without steroids.

Objective

To evaluate the effect of lumbar interlaminar epidural injections with or without steroids in managing various types of chronic low back and lower extremity pain emanating as a result of disc herniation or radiculitis, spinal stenosis, and chronic discogenic pain.

Methods

The available literature on lumbar interlaminar epidural injections with or without steroids in managing various types of chronic low back pain with or without lower extremity pain was reviewed. The quality assessment and clinical relevance criteria utilized were the Cochrane Musculoskeletal Review Group criteria as utilized for interventional techniques for randomized trials and the criteria developed by the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale criteria for observational studies. The level of evidence was classified as good, fair, or limited based on the quality of evidence developed by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF). Data sources included relevant literature identified through searches of PubMed and EMBASE from 1966 to December 2011, and manual searches of the bibliographies of known primary and review articles.

Outcome Measures

The primary outcome measure was pain relief (short-term relief = up to 6 months and long-term > 6 months). Secondary outcome measures were improvement in functional status, psychological status, return to work, and reduction in opioid intake.

Results

Overall, 82 lumbar interlaminar trials were identified. All non-randomized studies without fluoroscopy and randomized trials not meeting the inclusion criteria were excluded. Overall, 15 randomized trials and 11 non-randomized studies were included in the analysis. Analysis was derived mainly from fluoroscopically-guided randomized trials and non-randomized studies. The evidence is good for radiculitis secondary to disc herniation with local anesthetics and steroids, fair with local anesthetic only; whereas it is fair for radiculitis secondary to spinal stenosis with local anesthetic and steroids, and fair for axial pain without disc herniation with local anesthetic with or without steroids, with fluoroscopically-guided epidural injections.

Limitations

The limitations of this study include that we were unable to perform meta-analysis for disc herniation, and the paucity of evidence for discogenic pain and spinal stenosis. Further, methodological criteria have been highly variable along with sample sizes. The studies were heterogenous.

Conclusion

The evidence based on this systematic review is good for lumbar epidural injections under fluoroscopy for radiculitis secondary to disc herniation with local anesthetic and steroids, fair with local anesthetic only; whereas it is fair for radiculitis secondary to spinal stenosis with local anesthetic and steroids, and fair for axial pain without disc herniation with local anesthetic with or without steroids.

### Incidence of and risk factors for lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy in adults: a systematic review [^115Q14bg]. European Spine Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

Our review was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 statement. Details of our protocol were registered in the international prospective register of systematic reviews (PROSPERO No. CRD42011001197). This review was initially conducted in partial fulfilment of a doctoral dissertation in epidemiology as an unpublished manuscript, which we updated to September 2023.

Data sources and search strategy

We systematically searched Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central Trials Registry, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Database of Abstracts Related to Effects; initially from 1970 to March 2016. In February 2022, we conducted an update and identified records published between April 2016 and January 2022. We ran a final search update to 21 September 2023. Search strategies combined terms from three key concepts: intervertebral disc herniation, lumbar spine, and etiology, and were developed in consultation with an experienced information specialist (Appendix 1 in Online Supplementary Material). The reference lists of all eligible studies were also searched for additional relevant studies.

Eligibility criteria

Eligible were studies published in English, French, or Spanish that used cohort, case–control, or randomised trial (only potentially eligible for risk factor evidence) designs to examine the incidence of and/or risk factors for LDH with radiculopathy in adults (aged 18 years or older). We excluded studies of asymptomatic LDH, or LDH due to neoplasm, infection, fracture, dislocation, or spinal cord injury. Narrative reviews, case reports or series, cross-sectional, cadaveric, animal studies, or studies where the majority of the population was < 18 years of age were also excluded.

In consultation with clinical experts, we defined LDH with radiculopathy as lumbar or lumbosacral radiculopathy, sciatica, and/or clinically relevant neurologic deficit, with or without advanced imaging (i.e. MRI or CT) confirmation of disc herniation. We conceptualised and applied three types of case definitions for LDH with radiculopathy. A surgical case definition was used for study populations that had surgical intervention for LDH with radiculopathy. A hospital-based case definition applied when study participants sought medical care for LDH in a hospital setting without surgical intervention. A clinical case definition of LDH with radiculopathy was used to describe study populations identified or selected based on relevant clinical signs and symptoms of LDH with radiculopathy in primary care or community-based settings.

### Surgical versus non-surgical treatment for sciatica: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^112unCo8]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Abstract

Objective

To investigate the effectiveness and safety of surgery compared with non-surgical treatment for sciatica.

Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis.

Data sources

Medline, Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organisation International Clinical Trials Registry Platform from database inception to June 2022.

Eligibility criteria for selecting studies

Randomised controlled trials comparing any surgical treatment with non-surgical treatment, epidural steroid injections, or placebo or sham surgery, in people with sciatica of any duration due to lumbar disc herniation (diagnosed by radiological imaging).

Data extraction and synthesis

Two independent reviewers extracted data. Leg pain and disability were the primary outcomes. Adverse events, back pain, quality of life, and satisfaction with treatment were the secondary outcomes. Pain and disability scores were converted to a scale of 0 (no pain or disability) to 100 (worst pain or disability). Data were pooled using a random effects model. Risk of bias was assessed with the Cochrane Collaboration's tool and certainty of evidence with the grading of recommendations assessment, development, and evaluation (GRADE) framework. Follow-up times were into immediate term (≤ six weeks), short term (> six weeks and ≤ three months), medium term (> three and < 12 months), and long term (at 12 months).

Results

24 trials were included, half of these investigated the effectiveness of discectomy compared with non-surgical treatment or epidural steroid injections (1711 participants). Very low to low certainty evidence showed that discectomy, compared with non-surgical treatment, reduced leg pain: the effect size was moderate at immediate term (mean difference −12.1 (95% confidence interval −23.6 to −0.5)) and short term (−11.7 (−18.6 to −4.7)), and small at medium term (−6.5 (−11.0 to −2.1)). Negligible effects were noted at long term (−2.3 (−4.5 to −0.2)). For disability, small, negligible, or no effects were found. A similar effect on leg pain was found when comparing discectomy with epidural steroid injections. For disability, a moderate effect was found at short term, but no effect was observed at medium and long term. The risk of any adverse events was similar between discectomy and non-surgical treatment (risk ratio 1.34 (95% confidence interval 0.91 to 1.98)).

Conclusion

Very low to low certainty evidence suggests that discectomy was superior to non-surgical treatment or epidural steroid injections in reducing leg pain and disability in people with sciatica with a surgical indication, but the benefits declined over time. Discectomy might be an option for people with sciatica who feel that the rapid relief offered by discectomy outweighs the risks and costs associated with surgery.

### Efficacy of epidural injections in managing chronic spinal pain: a best evidence synthesis [^111pMTy3]. Pain Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Epidural injections have been used since 1901 in managing low back pain and sciatica. Spinal pain, disability, health, and economic impact continue to increase, despite numerous modalities of interventions available in managing chronic spinal pain. Thus far, systematic reviews performed to assess the efficacy of epidural injections in managing chronic spinal pain have yielded conflicting results.

Objective

To evaluate and update the clinical utility of the efficacy of epidural injections in managing chronic spinal pain.

Study Design

A systematic review of randomized controlled trials of epidural injections in managing chronic spinal pain.

Methods

In this systematic review, randomized trials with a placebo control or an active-control design were included. The outcome measures were pain relief and functional status improvement. The quality of each individual article was assessed by Cochrane review criteria, as well as the Interventional Pain Management Techniques-Quality Appraisal of Reliability and Risk of Bias Assessment (IPM-QRB). Best evidence synthesis was conducted based on the qualitative level of evidence (Level I to V). Data sources included relevant literature identified through searches of PubMed for a period starting in 1966 through August 2015; Cochrane reviews; and manual searches of the bibliographies of known primary and review articles.

Results

A total of 52 trials met inclusion criteria. Meta-analysis was not feasible. The evidence in managing lumbar disc herniation or radiculitis is Level II for long-term improvement either with caudal, interlaminar, or transforaminal epidural injections with no significant difference among the approaches. The evidence is Level II for long-term management of cervical disc herniation with interlaminar epidural injections. The evidence is Level II to III in managing thoracic disc herniation with an interlaminar approach. The evidence is Level II for caudal and lumbar interlaminar epidural injections with Level III evidence for lumbar transforaminal epidural injections for lumbar spinal stenosis. The evidence is Level III for cervical spinal stenosis management with an interlaminar approach. The evidence is Level II for axial or discogenic pain without facet arthropathy or disc herniation treated with caudal or lumbar interlaminar injections in the lumbar region; whereas it is Level III in the cervical region treated with cervical interlaminar epidural injections. The evidence for post lumbar surgery syndrome is Level II with caudal epidural injections and for post cervical surgery syndrome it is Level III with cervical interlaminar epidural injections.

Limitations

Even though this is a large systematic review with inclusion of a large number of randomized controlled trials, the paucity of high quality randomized trials literature continues to confound the evidence.

Conclusion

This systematic review, with an assessment of the quality of manuscripts and outcome parameters, shows the efficacy of epidural injections in managing a multitude of chronic spinal conditions.

### Efficacy of antibiotic treatment in patients with chronic low back pain and modic changes (the AIM study): double blind, randomised, placebo controlled, multicentre trial [^111KEVUJ]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Methods

Study design

This was a multicentre, randomised, double blind, placebo controlled, parallel group trial with a treatment phase (three months) and a follow-up phase (nine months). The trial was performed in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration and the International Conference on Harmonisation of Good Clinical Practice, reported according to the CONSORT guidelines, and was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov in December 2014 under the identifier: NCT02323412. The Regional Committees for Medical Research Ethics South East Norway (2014/158/REK sør-øst) and the Norwegian Medicines Agency (SLV; reference No 14/01368–11; EudraCT No 2013–004505–14) approved the trial before it started. The Clinical Trial Unit at Oslo University Hospital monitored the trial. All participants gave written informed consent. Methods were unchanged after trial commencement. Funding was granted by governmental organisations (Helse Sør-Øst and Helse Vest), which had no part in the planning, performing, or reporting of the trial. The trial protocol is available at ClinicalTrials.gov.

Participants

We recruited patients from outpatient clinics at six hospitals in Norway from June 2015 to September 2017. Inclusion criteria were age 18–65 years; low back pain for more than six months with intensity of at least 5 on a 0–10 numerical rating scale (mean of current, worst within the preceding two weeks, and usual/mean within the preceding two weeks); lumbar disc herniation on magnetic resonance imaging in the preceding two years; and type 1 or type 2 Modic changes (with height ≥ 10% of vertebral height and diameter > 5 mm) at the herniated disc level. In contrast to the trial we were reassessing, we chose to include patients with type 2 Modic changes because differentiating between type 1 and type 2 Modic changes is of uncertain relevance and might depend on the magnetic field strength of the MRI scanner used. We excluded patients who had surgery for disc herniation in the past year or antibiotic treatment in the past month. Figure S1 in the supplementary appendix contains all eligibility criteria.

### Lumbar stabilisation exercises versus back endurance-resistance exercise training in athletes with chronic low back pain: protocol of a randomised controlled trial [^111wzLFA]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Method

Study design

This study will consist of a 2-arm, prospectively registered randomised controlled trial.

Study setting

The study setting will be UNOPAR University, at the Physical Therapy Clinic, in the Laboratory of functional evaluation and human motor performance (LAFUP), Londrina PR, Brazil.

Eligibility

Male athletes with a minimum age between 18 and 40 years old will be recruited.

Inclusion criteria

Athletes with non-specific CLBP (defined as LBP for more than 12 weeks without a precise clinical diagnostic). Athletes had to participate in level-I (jumping, pivoting, hard cutting like basketball, handball, soccer) or level-II sports (less jumping or hard cutting than level I, like volleyball, racket sports, martial arts, gymnastics) and training or playing five times per week. Athletes must be participating in some official competitions (estate, national or international competition).

Exclusion criteria

Individuals with previous musculoskeletal surgery, disc herniation diagnosis, nerve root entrapment, spondylolysis, spondylolisthesis, lumbar stenosis, hip cartilage damage or labral injury, piriformis syndrome, neurological disease as well as athletes who participated in current physical therapy, pilates or manual therapy treatment were excluded. Athletes who are using analgesics, dietary supplementation and/or anabolic steroids will also be excluded.

Microdiscectomy versus epidural steroid injection in large herniations — In a prospective randomized controlled trial, of the 100 patients included in the study, 50 were assigned to each treatment group, with outcomes assessed at three years; surgically treated patients reported 92%-98% satisfaction versus 42%-56% for the epidural steroid injection group, and 27 patients failed injection and crossed over to surgery. The authors reported that for patients with large disc herniations occupying more than 25% of the spinal canal whose symptoms do not resolve in six weeks, surgery was more effective, though about 50% of patients who have injections will improve.

### Transforaminal endoscopic surgery for symptomatic lumbar disc herniations: a systematic review of the literature [^112E1UHB]. European Spine Journal (2010). Low credibility.

The study design includes a systematic literature review. The objective of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness of transforaminal endoscopic surgery and to compare this with open microdiscectomy in patients with symptomatic lumbar disc herniations. Transforaminal endoscopic techniques for patients with symptomatic lumbar disc herniations have become increasingly popular. The literature has not yet been systematically reviewed. A comprehensive systematic literature search of the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases was performed up to May 2008. Two reviewers independently checked all retrieved titles and abstracts and relevant full text articles for inclusion criteria. Included articles were assessed for quality and outcomes were extracted by the two reviewers independently. One randomized controlled trial, 7 non-randomized controlled trials and 31 observational studies were identified. Studies were heterogeneous regarding patient selection, indications, operation techniques, follow-up period and outcome measures and the methodological quality of these studies was poor. The eight trials did not find any statistically significant differences in leg pain reduction between the transforaminal endoscopic surgery group (89%) and the open microdiscectomy group (87%); overall improvement (84 vs. 78%), re-operation rate (6.8 vs. 4.7%) and complication rate (1.5 vs. 1%), respectively. In conclusion, current evidence on the effectiveness of transforaminal endoscopic surgery is poor and does not provide valid information to either support or refute using this type of surgery in patients with symptomatic lumbar disc herniations. High-quality randomized controlled trials with sufficiently large sample sizes are direly needed to evaluate if transforaminal endoscopic surgery is more effective than open microdiscectomy.

### Implementing the 27 PRISMA 2020 statement items for systematic reviews in the sport and exercise medicine, musculoskeletal rehabilitation and sports science fields: the PERSiST (implementing prisma in exercise, rehabilitation, sport medicine and sporTs science) guidance [^116M284L]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

The most relevant sources of bias differ depending on the study design. Assessing risk of bias requires a careful approach, tailored to the key threats to the internal validity (ie, bias) of the research question the systematic review aims to address. Different tools are appropriate for different study designs, and may include:

The Cochrane ROB 2.0 for assessing bias in randomised controlled trials.
ROBINS-I for assessing bias in non-randomised intervention studies.
PROBAST for assessing bias in prediction modelling studies.
QUIPS for assessing bias in prognostic studies.
QUADAS-II for assessing bias in diagnostic accuracy studies (see PRISMA-DTA Statement).

Example: 'We used the Risk of Bias 2 tool to assess risk of bias for each trial outcome. We assessed risk of bias on the basis of 'assignment to intervention' for all five domains: (1) randomisation process, (2) deviations from intended interventions, (3) missing outcome data, (4) outcome measurement and (5) selection of the reported result. An overall risk of bias judgement was made for each outcome and each time point as either 'low risk', 'some concerns' or 'high risk' of bias.

The assessment was performed independently by two reviewers. The reviewers did not perform risk of bias assessment or data extraction for publications in which they were involved as an author. Disagreements were resolved via consensus or by a third reviewer if necessary'.

Materials and methods

Study design

We used a prospective cohort design by merging data from three randomized trials on the effectiveness of exercise therapy in individuals with non-specific LBP. Patients enrolled in the trials were randomized into an intervention group that received either an 8–12-week, high-intensive or low-intensive isolated lumbar extensor training program using specific training devices, or usual care that mainly consisted of general exercise therapy. Average numbers of treatment sessions varied from 8 to 14, depending on the program. Mean intervention times per treatment session varied from 10 to 15 min (lumbar extensor training), and from 25 to 30 min (regular physiotherapy). An extensive description of the design and results of these trials have been published in recent years.

Subjects

The source population consisted of professional military employees of the Royal Netherlands Army (n = approx. 23,000). In total, 273 predominantly male participants (mean age 39 ± 10.5 years, range 20–56 years, 4 women) were recruited during regular GP consulting hours as well as through advertisement in military media. None of the participants were performing combat-related activities during their follow-up in the trials. Inclusion criteria were: at least 4 weeks of continuous LBP or recurrent (at least three times a week) episodes of LBP; pain localized between posterior iliac crests and angulus inferior scapulae; availability during duty time; and willingness to abandon other treatment interventions for the lower back during the intervention period. Exclusion criteria were: received spinal surgery in the last 2 years; specific treatment for LBP in the last 4 weeks (e.g. physiotherapy, manual therapy); severe LBP which hindered performing maximal isometric strength efforts; specific LBP, defined as herniated disk, ankylosing spondylitis, spondylolisthesis, or relevant neurological diseases. All three trials used comparable methods to collect demographic and clinical information prior to randomization.

Lumbar interlaminar epidural injections — evidence base and trial design — were studied for effectiveness in 53 studies, of which only 13 randomized controlled trials met inclusion criteria; using both Cochrane and IPM‑QRB criteria, 10 studies were rated high and 4 were rated moderate quality. Manchikanti et al conducted 3 of these studies, using an identical protocol with an active control design and a 2‑year follow‑up that compared two groups (local anesthetic only versus local anesthetic with a steroid), and across these three studies a total of 360 patients were evaluated for conditions including lumbar disc herniation and lumbar discogenic pain without facet joint or sacroiliac joint pain.

Lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy — randomized controlled trial of spinal manipulation versus chemonucleolysis (Burton et al): A prospective randomized controlled trial tested whether manipulative treatment provides at least equivalent 12 month outcomes to chemonucleolysis; of the 40 patients, 20 were randomly assigned to manipulation and 20 to chemonucleolysis. Outcomes were assessed at 12 months using the Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire, a pain thermometer (back and leg) and lumbar range of motion, and by 12 months both groups had significant improvements without significant differences between groups. The authors concluded that osteopathic manipulation can be considered a safe and effective option in the absence of clear surgical indications, and due to small sample size the potential Level II study provides Level III therapeutic evidence that spinal manipulation is as effective as chemonucleolysis.

### An update of the systematic assessment of mechanical lumbar disc decompression with nucleoplasty [^111V9KPR]. Pain Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Lumbar disc prolapse, protrusion, and extrusion account for less than 5% of all low back problems, but are the most common causes of nerve root pain and surgical interventions. The primary rationale for any form of surgery for disc prolapse is to relieve nerve root irritation or compression due to herniated disc material. The primary modality of treatment continues to be either open or microdiscectomy, although several alternative techniques are also utilized, including nucleoplasty, automated percutaneous discectomy and laser discectomy. There is a paucity of evidence for all decompression techniques, specifically alternative techniques including nucleoplasty.

Study Design

A systematic review of the literature of mechanical lumbar disc decompression with nucleoplasty.

Objective

To determine the effectiveness and update the effectiveness of mechanical lumbar disc decompression with nucleoplasty.

Methods

The available literature on mechanical lumbar disc decompression with nucleoplasty was reviewed. The quality assessment and clinical relevance criteria utilized were the Cochrane Musculoskeletal Review Group criteria as utilized for interventional techniques for randomized trials and the criteria developed by the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale criteria for observational studies. The level of evidence was classified as good, fair, and limited or poor based on the quality of evidence developed by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF). Data sources included relevant literature identified through searches of PubMed and EMBASE from 1966 to September 2012, and manual searches of the bibliographies of known primary and review articles.

Outcome Measures

Pain relief and functional improvement were the primary outcome measures. Other outcome measures were improvement of psychological status, reduction in opioid intake, and return to work. Short-term effectiveness was defined as one year or less, whereas long-term effectiveness was defined as greater than one year.

Results

For this systematic review, 37 studies were considered for inclusion. Of these, there was one randomized trial and 14 observational studies meeting inclusion criteria for methodological quality assessment. Based on USPSTF criteria, the level of evidence for nucleoplasty is limited to fair in managing radicular pain due to contained disc herniation.

Limitations

A paucity of literature with randomized trials.

Conclusions

This systematic review illustrates limited to fair evidence for nucleoplasty in managing radicular pain due to contained disc herniation.

### An evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy [^115reoZ3]. The Spine Journal (2014). Medium credibility.

Lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy — tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha inhibitors are not suggested to provide benefit in the treatment of lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy; Grade of Recommendation: B. In a randomized trial of adalimumab, of the 61 consecutively assigned patients, 31 received adjuvant treatment with two subcutaneous injections at seven-day intervals and 30 received placebo, with outcomes at six months using Visual Analog Scale (VAS) leg and low back pain, Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), SF-12, work status, drug use and whether patients proceeded to surgery; "Responders" were defined as improvement greater than 30% without surgery and "Low Residual Disease" as VAS scores of 0–20 without surgery and ODI of 20 or less. At week six, one patient in the experimental group and five patients in the placebo group proceeded to surgery, increasing to six and 13 at 24 weeks; this study provides Level I therapeutic evidence that a subcutaneous injection of adalimumab does not result in overall improvement at six weeks or six months relative to placebo. In a randomized infliximab trial, of the 40 patients, 21 were assigned to a 5 mg/kg single infusion and 19 to saline, with outcomes assessed at three months and one year; at 12 weeks and at one year there was no clinically significant difference between groups for back or leg pain, ODI, sick leave, greater than 75% pain reduction, Health-Related Quality of Life, or straight leg raise, and due to small sample size this provides Level II therapeutic evidence that a single intravenous infusion of infliximab, 5 mg/kg, is no better than a placebo at 12 weeks and one year.

Study descriptives

Eventually, 17 articlesfrom 14 studies with in total 2494 participants were included. An overview of extracted data of the included studies can be found in online supplementary material 4. Fifteen of the included articles from 12 studies described randomised controlled trials, while two articles described controlled before-after studies. Most studies were conducted in high-income countries (ie, Western Europe, USA or Australia) and two studies in Chinastudying samples of patients undergoing surgeries to their back (ie, laminectomy, lumbar discectomy, disc surgery and spinal stenosis), upper limbs (ie, anterior shoulder dislocation repair), hips (ie, total hip arthroplasty)and knees (ie, ACL reconstruction and knee arthroplasty). Patient samples consisted of combinations of men and women, and the average age of the study samples ranged from 29 to 70 years, with an average (SD) of 51 (14) years.

Regarding relevant intervention components, five studies used an e/mHealth intervention. Active referral to a case manager was assessed by three studies. Six studies reported the effects of a combined intervention with two components, that is, active referral to a case manager and goal setting (in four studies), goal setting and e/mHealth (one study), and active referral and e/mHealth (one study). The intervention length ranged from 14 daysto 36 months. In 12 studies, the control group received usual care only, while in two studies described in three articles, usual care also included an education programme on postoperative recovery and extra phone meetings.

Regarding risk of bias (figure 2; online supplementary material 5–6), randomised controlled trials showed a low or unclear risk of bias regarding patient randomisation, allocation concealment, blinding of the outcome assessment and selective reporting. All studies showed high or unclear risk of bias regarding blinding of the participants and care providers while four studies had a high risk of bias due to incomplete outcome data. Also, there were other sources of bias indicated such as selection bias and poor intervention compliance. Out of the non-randomised studies, one study showed a high overall risk of biasand one study showed a low overall risk of bias.

### Full endoscopic versus open discectomy for sciatica: randomised controlled non-inferiority trial [^115tDLEg]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Abstract

Objective

To assess whether percutaneous transforaminal endoscopic discectomy (PTED) is non-inferior to conventional open microdiscectomy in reduction of leg pain caused by lumbar disc herniation.

Design

Multicentre randomised controlled trial with non-inferiority design.

Setting

Four hospitals in the Netherlands.

Participants

613 patients aged 18–70 years with at least six weeks of radiating leg pain caused by lumbar disc herniation. The trial included a predetermined set of 125 patients receiving PTED who were the learning curve cases performed by surgeons who did not do PTED before the trial.

Interventions

PTED (n = 179) compared with open microdiscectomy (n = 309).

Main outcome measures

The primary outcome was self-reported leg pain measured by a 0–100 visual analogue scale at 12 months, assuming a non-inferiority margin of 5.0. Secondary outcomes included complications, reoperations, self-reported functional status as measured with the Oswestry Disability Index, visual analogue scale for back pain, health related quality of life, and self-perceived recovery. Outcomes were measured until one year after surgery and were longitudinally analysed according to the intention-to-treat principle. Patients belonging to the PTED learning curve were omitted from the primary analyses.

Results

At 12 months, patients who were randomised to PTED had a statistically significantly lower visual analogue scale score for leg pain (median 7.0, interquartile range 1.0–30.0) compared with patients randomised to open microdiscectomy (16.0, 2.0–53.5) (between group difference of 7.1, 95% confidence interval 2.8 to 11.3). Blood loss was less, length of hospital admission was shorter, and timing of postoperative mobilisation was earlier in the PTED group than in the open microdiscectomy group. Secondary patient reported outcomes such as the Oswestry Disability Index, visual analogue scale for back pain, health related quality of life, and self-perceived recovery, were similarly in favour of PTED. Within one year, nine (5%) in the PTED group compared with 14 (6%) in the open microdiscectomy group had repeated surgery. Per protocol analysis and sensitivity analyses including the patients of the learning curve resulted in similar outcomes to the primary analysis.

Conclusions

PTED was non-inferior to open microdiscectomy in reduction of leg pain. PTED resulted in more favourable results for self-reported leg pain, back pain, functional status, quality of life, and recovery. These differences, however, were small and may not reach clinical relevance. PTED can be considered as an effective alternative to open microdiscectomy in treating sciatica.

### Percutaneous lumbar laser disc decompression: an update of current evidence [^115e4GDX]. Pain Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Since the descriptions by Mixter and Barr of surgical treatment for rupture of the intervertebral disc in 1934, open surgical procedures have become a common practice. Disc herniations are often classified as being contained or non-contained. The results of open surgical discectomy for contained disc herniation have been poor. Consequently, several less invasive techniques have been developed including percutaneous lumbar laser disc decompression.

Study Design

A systematic review of the literature of percutaneous lumbar laser disc decompression.

Objective

The objective of this systematic review is to evaluate and update the clinical effectiveness of percutaneous lumbar laser discectomy in managing radicular pain secondary to contained disc herniation.

Methods

The available literature on lumbar laser disc decompression in managing chronic low back and lower extremity pain was reviewed. Quality assessment and clinical relevance of randomized trials were graded according to the Cochrane Musculoskeletal Review Group criteria for interventional techniques, and observational studies according to the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale criteria. The level of evidence was classified as good, fair, and limited or poor based on the quality of evidence developed by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF). Data sources included relevant literature identified through searches of PubMed and EMBASE from 1966 to September 2012, and manual searches of the bibliographies of known primary and review articles.

Outcome Measures

Pain relief was the primary outcome measure. Other outcome measures were functional improvement, improvement of psychological status, opioid intake, and return-to-work. Short-term effectiveness was defined as effectiveness lasting one year or less, whereas, long-term effectiveness was defined as benefit persisting for greater than one year.

Results

Based on USPSTF criteria, the indicated level of evidence for percutaneous lumbar laser disc decompression is limited for short- and long-term relief.

Limitations

Although laser discectomy has been utilized for many years, there is a paucity of randomized clinical trials.

Conclusion

This systematic review shows limited evidence for percutaneous lumbar laser disc decompression.

### An update of comprehensive evidence-based guidelines for interventional techniques in chronic spinal pain. part II: guidance and recommendations [^113bi5ud]. Pain Physician (2013). Medium credibility.

Lumbar interlaminar epidural injections — spinal stenosis study set — include randomized and observational studies summarized in Table 11 and one new SPORT subgroup analysis that was excluded; there were only 69 patients receiving epidural steroid injection, so results may not be applied to contemporary interventional pain management settings and the study failed to meet inclusion criteria. Across eligible studies, there were 5 randomized trials and one non-randomized study with at least moderate methodologic quality, though none utilized 100 or more patients; two randomized trials were performed under fluoroscopy, with a preliminary report by Manchikanti et al showing positive results with local anesthetic as well as steroids and the other randomized fluoroscopically guided trial showing short-term positive results. In randomized trials without fluoroscopy, one study utilized an intermuscular injection control considered as a placebo, and short-term results were positive with blind epidural for spinal stenosis with a small number of patients in one trial.

### Surgical vs nonoperative treatment for lumbar disk herniation… [^112PSLAP]. JAMA Network (2006). Excellent credibility.

SPORT was conducted at 13 multidisciplinary spine practices in 11 US states. The human subjects committee of each participating institution approved a standardized protocol. All patients provided written informed consent. An independent data and safety monitoring board monitored the study at 6-month intervals.
13. SPORT findings are consistent with clinical experience in that relief of leg pain was the most striking and consistent improvement with surgery. Importantly, all patients in this trial had leg pain with physical examination and imaging findings that confirmed a disk herniation. There was little evidence of harm from either treatment. No patients in either group developed cauda equina syndrome; 95% of surgical patients had no intraoperative complications.

To fully understand the treatment effect of surgery compared with nonoperative treatment, it is worth noting how each group fared. The improvements with surgery in SPORT were similar to those of prior series at 1 year: for the ODI, 31 points vs 34 points in the Stanford series; for the bodily pain scale, 40 points vs 44 in the MLSS; and for sciatica bothersomeness, 10 points vs 11 in the MLSS. The observed improvements with nonoperative treatment in SPORT were greater than those in the MLSS, resulting in the small estimated treatment effect. The nonoperative improvement of 37, 35, and 9 points in bodily pain, physical function, and sciatica bothersomeness, respectively, were much greater than the improvements of 20, 18, and 3 points reported in the MLSS. The greater improvement with nonoperative treatment in SPORT may be related to the large proportion of patients who underwent surgery in this group. The nonoperative treatments used were consistent with published guidelines.

17, 38, 39 Compared with the MLSS, SPORT had lower use of activity restriction, spinal manipulation, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, and braces and corsets, and higher rates of epidural steroid injections and use of narcotic analgesics. This flexible nonoperative protocol had the advantages of individualization that considered patient preferences in the choice of nonoperative treatment and of reflecting current practice among multidisciplinary spine practices. However, we cannot make any conclusion regarding the effect of surgery vs any specific nonoperative treatment. Similarly, we cannot adequately assess the relative efficacy of any differences in surgical technique.

### Surgical vs nonoperative treatment for lumbar disk herniation… [^113BiNjA]. JAMA Network (2006). Excellent credibility.

Context For patients with lumbar disk herniation, the Spine Patient Outcomes Research Trial randomized trial intent-to-treat analysis showed small but not statistically significant differences in favor of diskectomy compared with usual care. However, the large numbers of patients who crossed over between assigned groups precluded any conclusions about the comparative effectiveness of operative therapy vs usual care. In anticipation of these concerns, SPORT was designed to include a concurrent observational cohort study in which identical selection and outcomes assessment occurred, but participants declined randomization. This article reports the 2-year follow-up results for the SPORT intervertebral disk herniation observational cohort. SPORT was conducted in 11 US states at 13 medical centers with multidisciplinary spine practices.

The human subjects committees at each participating institution approved a standardized protocol for both the observational and the randomized cohorts. Patient inclusion and exclusion criteria, study interventions, outcome measures, and follow-up procedures have been reported.
5. Overall, 528 patients received surgery during the first 2 years and 191 remained nonoperative. The baseline characteristics of participants are shown in Table 1, according to whether they actually received surgery during the 2 years of follow-up. A comparison between the SPORT observational and randomized cohorts is also provided. A variety of nonoperative treatments were used during SPORT. In the observational cohort, 92% received education and counseling, 58% received nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, 35% received narcotic analgesic agents, 43% underwent physical therapy, and 38% underwent epidural injections.

The results of SPORT are similar to the Maine Lumbar Spine Study1 and the classic Weber study. 3 The former reported unadjusted treatment effect differences at 1 year of 24 and 22, similar to SPORT's 15. 3 and
25. 1, respectively. However, these unadjusted results overestimate the true effect of surgery because of baseline differences between groups. While there are no validated outcome measures that can be directly compared between SPORT and the Weber study, its 1-year results of 33% more patients with "good" results in the surgical group is similar to SPORT's 21% more patients with major improvement and 26% having more satisfaction with symptoms 1 year after surgery than those who received nonoperative care. In these prior studies, the differences in the outcomes between treatment groups continued to narrow over time, suggesting the importance of ongoing follow-up of the patients in SPORT.

### Operative vs. nonoperative treatment for back pain… [^114kyvWC]. AAFP (2007). Low credibility.

Background: Lumbar disk surgery is performed disproportionately in different regions of the United States, and its effectiveness compared with nonoperative management for patients with herniated disks is unclear. The Spine Patient Outcomes Research Trial followed two cohorts — one randomized and one observational — to compare outcomes for surgical and nonoperative management of herniated disks and other nerve-compressing conditions. The Study: Patients who had received non-operative treatment for disk herniation but whose symptoms had persisted for at least six weeks were enrolled. Eligible participants also had to have physical examination evidence of nerve-root impingement and advanced vertebral imaging showing a herniated disk. Participants were randomized to receive surgery or nonoperative management. Those in the surgery arm had diskectomy with release of the affected nerve root.

The usual-care arm involved a recommended minimum of physical therapy, exercise counseling, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. However, patients could receive other modalities, such as epidural injection, chiropractic therapy, or opioids. Outcome measures were performance on the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey bodily pain and function scales and on the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons' version of a disability index. Patients were followed for two years and surveyed at baseline, six weeks, three and six months, and one and two years. Secondary outcomes included patients' accounts of their improvement, work status, and satisfaction, and a measure of symptom severity. Both groups improved at each follow-up, with a treatment effect favoring surgery. There were no statistically significant differences in the primary outcomes. In the secondary outcomes, there were no statistically significant differences in patient satisfaction or employment status.

On the Sciatica Bothersomeness Index, a treatment effect favored surgery, and there was a small, statistically significant difference favoring surgery in patients' perception of their progress. When crossover treatment was taken into account with an as-treated rather than an intention-to-treat analysis, the results strongly favored surgery at all follow-up times. Conclusion: Patients with persistent symptoms attributable to lumbar disk herniation improved substantially whether they received nonoperative or surgical treatment. In the intent-to-treat analysis, there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups in the global primary outcomes measures, but there were some differences in secondary outcomes favoring surgery. However, an as-treated analysis showed stronger improvement from surgery, suggesting that the study methods led to an underestimation of the surgical benefits.
