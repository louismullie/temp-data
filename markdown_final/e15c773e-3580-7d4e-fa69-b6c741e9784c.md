## Question

Example 5 In space, there are four spheres with radii of 2, 2, 3, and 3. Each sphere is externally tangent to the other three spheres. There is another smaller sphere that is externally tangent to these four spheres. Find the radius of the smaller sphere.

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for the radius of a smaller sphere that is externally tangent to four mutually externally tangent spheres with radii 2, 2, 3, and 3. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the geometric configuration and whether the centers of the four given spheres lie at the vertices of a tetrahedron. Then, I should verify the edge lengths of that tetrahedron using the condition that each pair of spheres is externally tangent. Next, I will set up Descartes' Theorem in 3D (Soddy–Gosset) to relate the curvatures of the five spheres. After that, I need to solve the resulting quadratic equation for the curvature of the smaller sphere and convert it back to a radius. Finally, I should double-check the arithmetic and confirm that the solution is physically reasonable and unique in this context.

> Let me first confirm the geometry. Four mutually externally tangent spheres in 3D space have centers that form a tetrahedron, with edge lengths equal to the sum of the radii of the touching pairs. So the edges are 2+2 = 4, 2+3 = 5, and 3+3 = 6, giving a tetrahedron with edges 4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6, which is consistent with the problem statement.

> Wait, let me verify the 3D version of Descartes' Theorem before I jump ahead. In three dimensions, for five mutually tangent spheres, the Soddy–Gosset relation states that the squares of the curvatures sum to one-third the square of their sum: k1² + k2² + k3² + k4² + k5² = (1/3)(k1 + k2 + k3 + k4 + k5)², where curvature k = 1/r and r is the radius. I should confirm that this is the correct form and that it applies when all tangencies are external, which it does for this configuration.

> I will now examine the curvatures of the given spheres. Radii 2, 2, 3, 3 correspond to curvatures 1/2, 1/2, 1/3, 1/3. Let the unknown smaller sphere have radius r and curvature k = 1/r. Plugging into the 3D Descartes relation, I get (1/2)² + (1/2)² + (1/3)² + (1/3)² + k² = (1/3)(1/2 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/3 + k)². Simplifying the left side gives 1/4 + 1/4 + 1/9 + 1/9 + k² = 1/2 + 2/9 + k² = 13/18 + k². The right side is (1/3)(1 + 2/3 + k)² = (1/3)(5/3 + k)² = (1/3)(25/9 + 10k/3 + k²) = 25/27 + 10k/9 + k²/3. Setting them equal yields 13/18 + k² = 25/27 + 10k/9 + k²/3, which I should rearrange into a quadratic in k.

> Hold on, I should verify the algebra carefully. Subtracting k²/3 from both sides and moving terms gives (2/3)k² − (10/9)k + 13/18 − 25/27 = 0. Converting to a common denominator, 13/18 = 39/54 and 25/27 = 50/54, so the constant term is −11/54. Multiplying through by 54 to clear denominators, I get 36k² − 60k − 11 = 0. Solving this quadratic, the discriminant is 3600 + 1584 = 5184 = 72², so k = (60 ± 72)/72. This gives k = 132/72 = 11/6 or k = −12/72 = −1/6. Since curvature is positive for a real externally tangent sphere, I take k = 11/6, which implies r = 6/11.

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought the smaller sphere might have radius 1/6 because of the −1/6 root, but that would correspond to a sphere with negative curvature, which in this context represents an enclosing sphere rather than a small sphere nestled among the four. I should confirm that the physically relevant solution here is the positive curvature root, yielding r = 6/11, and that this matches the expected scale relative to the given radii, which it does.

> Let me reconsider the uniqueness and reasonableness of the answer. The quadratic yields two mathematical roots, but only the positive curvature corresponds to a smaller sphere externally tangent to all four given spheres; the negative curvature root corresponds to a larger enclosing sphere, which is a different problem. Given the symmetry and the relative sizes, a radius of 6/11 ≈ 0.545 sits sensibly between the smallest given radius of 2 and zero, confirming the solution is geometrically consistent.

---

The radius of the smaller sphere externally tangent to four spheres with radii 2, 2, 3, and 3 is **6/11**. This result is obtained using the 3D version of Descartes' Theorem (Soddy–Gosset theorem), which relates the curvatures of mutually tangent spheres. The curvature of the smaller sphere is **11/6**, so its radius is the reciprocal, **6/11**.

---

## Geometric setup

We have four spheres with radii 2, 2, 3, and 3, each externally tangent to the other three. Their centers form a tetrahedron whose edge lengths are the sums of the radii of the tangent pairs. We seek the radius of a smaller sphere externally tangent to all four.

---

## 3D Descartes' theorem (Soddy–Gosset theorem)

The 3D Descartes' theorem states that for five mutually tangent spheres with curvatures (kᵢ = [1/rᵢ]), the following relation holds:

(k₁ + k₂ + k₃ + k₄ + k₅)² = 3(k₁² + k₂² + k₃² + k₄² + k₅²)

Here, the curvatures are **positive** for externally tangent spheres and **negative** for internally tangent spheres.

---

## Applying the theorem

Let the curvatures of the given spheres be:

k₁ = [1/2], k₂ = [1/2], k₃ = [1/3], k₄ = [1/3]

Let the curvature of the smaller sphere be (k₅ = [1/r]), where (r) is the unknown radius. Substitute into the theorem:

([1/2] + [1/2] + [1/3] + [1/3] + [1/r])² = 3(([1/2])² + ([1/2])² + ([1/3])² + ([1/3])² + ([1/r])²)

Simplify the left side:

(1 + [2/3] + [1/r])² = ([5/3] + [1/r])²

Simplify the right side:

3([1/4] + [1/4] + [1/9] + [1/9] + [1/r²]) = 3([1/2] + [2/9] + [1/r²]) = 3([13/18] + [1/r²]) = [13/6] + [3/r²]

Set the two sides equal:

([5/3] + [1/r])² = [13/6] + [3/r²]

Expand the left side:

[25/9] + [10/(3r)] + [1/r²] = [13/6] + [3/r²]

Rearrange terms:

[25/9] − [13/6] + [10/(3r)] + [1/r²] − [3/r²] = 0

[(50 − 39)/18] + [10/(3r)] − [2/r²] = 0

[11/18] + [10/(3r)] − [2/r²] = 0

Multiply through by (18r²) to clear denominators:

11r² + 60r − 36 = 0

---

## Solving the quadratic equation

Solve the quadratic equation (11r² + 60r − 36 = 0) using the quadratic formula:

r = [(−60 ± √(60² − 4×11×(−36)))/(2×11)] = [(−60 ± √(3600 + 1584))/22] = [(−60 ± √5184)/22] = [(−60 ± 72)/22]

This yields two solutions:

r = [12/22] = [6/11] or r = [−132/22] = −6

Since a radius cannot be negative, the valid solution is **(r = [6/11])**.

---

## Verification

To verify, substitute (r = [6/11]) back into the original equation:

([5/3] + [11/6])² = ([10/6] + [11/6])² = ([21/6])² = ([7/2])² = [49/4]

And:

[13/6] + 3([11/6])² = [13/6] + 3×[121/36] = [13/6] + [121/12] = [26/12] + [121/12] = [147/12] = [49/4]

Both sides equal **[49/4]**, confirming the solution.

---

The radius of the smaller sphere externally tangent to the four given spheres is **6/11**.

Comparison within and between baby lungs of different capacities

The LaPlace equation dictates that expansion of any given sphere increases its wall tension. For a spherical structure of volume (V), however, the tension (T) that develops within its spherical subunits will depend upon the number (n) of such units that comprise their collective volume (V) (Additional file 1: Part 2). We note that when expressed in the same numerical units, a larger sphere that contains the same net volume as a collection of smaller subunits will have a SLM tension that exceeds the wall tensions of its constituent subunits (Fig. 3). More specifically, a simple calculation indicates that for two non-communicating collections (A and B) of identical cumulative volume containing n A and n B numbers of subunits, respectively:

Fig. 3
Comparison of wall tension of two spheres with different composition but the same pressure and cumulative volume. Left panel: Tension increases as a single unit increases its volume from radius r to R, in accordance with the LaPlace equation. Right panel: In a sphere comprised of multiple such subunits, the tighter curvature of each subunit (each of radius r) as opposed to that of their encapsulating SLM (with radius R), helps subunit force balance to be achieved with less wall tension

(Additional file 1: 2)In other words, the same absolute volume contained in a separate sphere comprised of fewer units will have higher SLM subunit tension; therefore, increasing the capacity (subunit numbers) of the hypothetical baby lung will reduce tensions in the individual subunits that comprise it.

### Measurement of gravitational coupling between millimetre-sized masses [^1157XjZb]. Nature (2021). Excellent credibility.

Gravity is the weakest of all known fundamental forces and poses some of the most important open questions to modern physics: it remains resistant to unification within the standard model of physics and its underlying concepts appear to be fundamentally disconnected from quantum theory 1–4. Testing gravity at all scales is therefore an important experimental endeavour 5–7. So far, these tests have mainly involved macroscopic masses at the kilogram scale and beyond 8. Here we show gravitational coupling between two gold spheres of 1 millimetre radius, thereby entering the regime of sub-100-milligram sources of gravity. Periodic modulation of the position of the source mass allows us to perform a spatial mapping of the gravitational force. Both linear and quadratic coupling are observed as a consequence of the nonlinearity of the gravitational potential. Our results extend the parameter space of gravity measurements to small, single source masses and low gravitational field strengths. Further improvements to our methodology will enable the isolation of gravity as a coupling force for objects below the Planck mass. This work opens the way to the unexplored frontier of microscopic source masses, which will enable studies of fundamental interactions 9–11 and provide a path towards exploring the quantum nature of gravity 12–15.

### Establishment of a locally adaptive allele in multidimensional continuous space [^113LKhbg]. G3 (2025). Medium credibility.

Model

A haploid monoecious species distributed at a uniform density ρ in d -dimensional space is considered. Under additive fitness, the following results can be extended to diploid species by substituting ρ with. There exist 2 distinct environments: environment 1 and environment 2. A biallelic locus A/a is assumed, where allele A is advantageous in environment 1 but deleterious in environment 2. The log fitness of alleles A and a is denoted byand 0 in environment 1 andand 0 in environment 2, respectively. Environmental conditions at any location are assumed to remain constant over time. Throughout this study, a large ρ value is assumed to prevent the local fixation of deleterious alleles.

Migration occurs in every generation. In this study, all migration events are short range, and no long-range dispersal is considered. The distance between the offspring position, and parent position, follows a Gaussian distribution with variance

It should be noted that the results may depend on the function of the migration kernel only slightly, provided the moments above the third order ofare small and the continuous approximation holds, as discussed by.

First, we explore local adaptation driven by a new mutation. A target patch with radius R is assumed, wherein the interior and exterior environments were designated as environment 1 and environment 2, respectively (Fig. 1). Depending on d, the patch shape could be a line segment, a circle, or a sphere. Initially, allele a is fixed throughout the space and then an allele A arises by mutation. Let r denote the distance between the mutation origin and the center of the target patch. If, the mutation will occur within the target patch, while if, the mutation will arise in an unsuitable environment. Using this model, the establishment probability of an allele A is investigated. In this study, the establishment probability is defined as the probability that the descendants of an allele reach the target patch, increase in frequency, and are stably maintained at migration-selection balance.

Formation and imaging of binary colloidal crystals

To form DD crystals, we use an aqueous suspension containing two types of similarly sized microspheres with diameters of roughly 400 nm, which have been engineered to have controllable and chemically specific interactions. For the two species 'A' and 'B', our four adjustable parameters are two 'like' attraction strengths, U AA and U BB, one 'unlike' one, U AB = U BA, (defined as positive-valued parameters) and the spheres' diameter ratio, σ A / σ B. The interactions are realized and modulated by grafting various amounts of complementary DNA strands to the two particle species' surfaces, see Methods for details. When two microspheres bearing complementary DNA sequences come near contact, DNA hybridization leads to molecular bridges that pull the spheres together. At sufficiently high DNA densitythe attraction resembles an isotropic, reversible interaction potentialwith a range of about 30 nm. All particle pairs also exhibit a soft repulsion near contact due to the compression of their DNA brushes, having a range of roughly 10 nm. Since both length scales are much shorter than a particle radius, we consider the particles to act nearly as 'sticky' hard spheres, whose packing is determined by the size of their hard cores, but with an additional energy benefit when spheres with complementary DNA are in contact. Temperature provides a convenient means to modulate the colloidal interactions, since DNA bridges dissociate at elevated temperature. To form crystals, we place a binary suspension of 20% total particle volume fraction in a slowly cooling hot water bath. As the temperature falls, the attractive interactions become gradually stronger until crystals form by homogeneous nucleation.

The resulting, typically polyhedralcrystallites are permanently crosslinked by enzymatic ligation, mounted in a high-index mounting medium and imaged on a confocal microscope. The two particle types are stained with different dyes: smaller A spheres in green, and larger B spheres in red, which can be imaged separately. With the particle sizes and mounting medium we use, the crystallites are effectively transparent, and we can observe both their global shape and lattice structure throughout their depth. While confocal microscopy cannot resolve the three-dimensional structure of sub-micron lattices in the depth direction, it can resolve the particle arrangement and spacing in two-dimensional focal plane slices. The resulting images resemble the superposition of two adjacent crystal planes parallel to the focal plane. By matching these patterns to computer-rendered lattice models from different viewing angles, for an ensemble of crystallites and two colour channels, the three-dimensional lattice structures can be reliably inferred.

### Qualitative and quantitative evaluation of blob-based time-of-flight PET image reconstruction in hybrid brain PET / MR imaging [^112obg78]. Molecular Imaging and Biology (2015). Low credibility.

Contrast Recovery Coefficient

Figure 2a shows the quantitative CRC values for three representative sphere sizes (smaller, middle, and larger sphere) based on different reconstruction parameters. As the sphere size increases, so does the CRC values. For the first parameter set and 12 iterations, the maximum CRC is 83 and 47% for the large and small sphere, respectively. Absolute differences between parameter sets are small, approximately 2% but several patterns could be recognized. The CRC decreases with larger radius values, but increases by 5–15% with increasing iterations. Larger radius values result in a CRC decrease of approximately 1–2% due to the fact that the blobs have a larger FWHM, also causing resolution degradation.

It can be observed that the reconstructions are grouped based on the radius representing first, second, and third zero crossings. In addition, the radii representing the first zero crossing have larger differences within the group. This finding is consistent with the errors found by Matej et al. with parameters in the first zero crossing resulting in errors up to 1%, while the maximum error in the third crossing is substantially lower.

Image Roughness and Background Variability

Figure 2b and c shows the calculated quantitative noise metrics; image roughness; and background variability (Eqs. 4 and 5). The BV values appear to decrease with sphere size. For smaller sphere sizes, larger BV variations are observed, substantiating that noise reduction is larger in smaller regions when using parameters from the third zero crossing. In contrast, IR is similar for all sphere sizes since the pixel to pixel variability depends less on sphere size.

For all sphere sizes, the IR increases by 5–15% with iterations. The BV also show a small increase (0.3–3%); however, for large sphere sizes and larger radii (third zero crossing), the BV stays almost constant. After 12 iterations, the largest difference between parameter sets is approximately 15 and 3% for the IR and BV, respectively.

Similar groups are seen in both BV and IR as in the CRC results, representing the first, second, and third zero crossing. The variability within the first group is the largest (∼0.3–1% and ∼5% for BV and IR, respectively), the variability within the last group the smallest (0–0.25% and 1% for the BV and IR, respectively) probably due to larger errors for smaller blobs.

### Vortex knots in tangled quantum eigenfunctions [^111qDhbv]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

Probabilities and complexities of knottedness

As one might expect, the random eigenfunction statistics show that longer knotted vortex curves display a greater complexity of knot types, as measured by the knot determinant |Δ(−1)|. This is represented in Fig. 2 for each of the three systems at fixed energy. These histograms indicate that the distribution of log |Δ(−1)| with respect to vortex length L apparently scales according to a power law. Longer curves are also more likely to be knotted; the probability of a given vortex loop being unknotted decreases exponentially according to L (Fig. 2 insets), as previously studied for random walks modelling polymers. The value of the unknotting exponents is different for each of the three systems, given in the caption.

Each of the model systems studied has a finite spatial extent, namely the side length of the cube and the diameters of the 3-sphere and classically allowed region of the 3DHO. In the latter two cases, this finite size imposes a long-length cutoff S to the Brownian scaling of long vortex lines. In the 3-sphere and 3DHO, loops whose radius of gyration exceeds S are confined, and the Brownian and confined regimes have different knotting probability exponents. Both knotting probability and complexity increase distinctly with length in the confined regime, where long curves are restricted to volumes much smaller than the corresponding Brownian radius of gyration would allow.

In contrast, the cube's periodic boundary conditions allow the vortex lines to have extent greater than the cube's side length, although the Brownian scaling of loop sizes gives way at some S to the lines with nontrivial homology, which do not contribute to the knot count. Figure 2b, c shows that the minimal complexity of knots in the confined regime also scales with L; long vortices are always knotted in these systems, and the knot is usually very complex. By contrast, under periodic boundary conditions (Fig. 2a) even the longest vortex loops can be topologically trivial. In all of these cases, the scaling depends weakly on the energy of the eigenfunction, at least in the ranges of energy considered in the simulations.

### Active colloids as mobile microelectrodes for unified label-free selective cargo transport [^112PyyAr]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Influence of cargo size on loading capacity

As well as the size of the carrier and the applied voltage, the load capacity of the cargo is characterized by a delicate interplay between the size and shape of the carrier relative to the cargo (Fig. 3). In general, devices relying on DEP as a trapping mechanism are most suited to micron-sized objects — as the force scales with the radius cubed — and the extension to the nanoscale requires complex patterning to obtain the necessary high fields without undesirable high voltages. In contrast, the current colloidal setup is optimal for nanotargets, as the smaller particles can penetrate closer to the center of the JP, towards the region of maximum high field strength — as is evidenced by the smaller minimum radii of the area trapped for smaller targets (Fig. 3b). In addition, as larger targets begin to accumulate, they can 'shield' the field intensity, such that particles further back are not exposed to a field of sufficient strength to induce trapping. This 3D shielding may explain the plateau of the area at high voltages, where despite the increased field, the maximum radius at which particles are trapped does not increase — although for smaller particles we do see a continued increase in intensity, indicating trapping in the x 2 direction (i.e. suggesting the formation of more compact multiple layers). This supposition is further supported by the observation that the onset of the plateau occurs at lower voltages as the tracer size increases. The interplay between these geometric constraints and the dielectrophoretic force results in a non-monotonic increase of the trapping area with respect to the target radius, and suggests that for a given target there is an optimal size cargo carrier that can maximize the load carried (Fig. 3a).

### A bimodal distribution of haze in pluto's atmosphere [^112wtbnR]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

As monodispersed fractal aggregates and surface reflection cannot reproduce the observed large backscattering, we consider a bimodal distribution of two haze particle populations with different sizes under scenario (3). Besides the aggregates as described in scenario (1), we include a population of small spheres, which are parameterized with two variables, radius (R s) and number density (n s). Therefore, six free parameters in total are considered in the retrieval. The vertical profiles of these six parameters, as determined by the MCMC, are shown in Fig. 3, and their PDFs at one of the altitudes (22.5 km) are given in Supplementary Fig. 4. Similar to those in scenario (2), we obtain a population of ~1 μm two-dimensional aggregates with ~20 nm monomers across the entire considered altitude region, as well as a population of spheres with radii of ~80 nm. These two radii in the bimodal distribution are similar to those simulated in Titan's atmosphere. Comparison between the modeled observables and observations (Fig. 1) indicates that, under this scenario both the large forward and backward scattering could be explained, along with the given UV extinction. The two types of haze particles have comparable UV extinctions, with each dominating one of the forward and backward scattering in the visible (Fig. 2). Some "apparent" disagreements are seen for the MVIC backscattering observations (Fig. 1b), which are due to their large uncertainties, as the bandpass of the MVIC color filters are much smaller than that of LORRI. The derived backscattering intensities are still mostly within the 1-σ uncertainties.

Seven other particle size distributions were also tested: (4) bimodal distribution of spheres (particles with D f = 3), (5) log-normal distribution of spheres, (6) power-law distribution of spheres, (7) exponential distribution of spheres, (8) log-normal distribution of two-dimensional aggregates (particles with D f = 2), (9) power-law distribution of two-dimensional aggregates, and (10) exponential distribution of two-dimensional aggregates. We quantify the goodness of fit using the maximal probability that can be reached under each scenario as defined in Eq. (20). All of the seven scenarios presented here show goodness of fit far worse than the bimodal distribution of large aggregates and small particles (Supplementary Table 2, Supplementary Fig. 7).

### Empirical models of transverse relaxation for spherical magnetic perturbers [^117Xxjb9]. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (2003). Low credibility.

Ferromagnetic or superparamagnetic particles as MRI contrast agent present many advantages for bringing about soft tissue contrast as compared to single-ion complexes. The classic microscopic outersphere theory that works successfully for small molecules in understanding the transverse relaxation rate 1/T(2) is not valid for these larger and stronger magnetic spheres. We categorize the relaxation behavior of the tissue-sphere system for ferromagnetic spherical perturbers in five diffusion regimes. Over the entire range of perturber size a general understanding of the relaxation mechanisms is described in terms of basic physical features of the system, and, through empiric models, the imaging sequences of spin echo and gradient echo. The models are verified with results of our spectroscopic measurements as well as simulations and experiments in the literature. Normalized models, obtained through proper scaling of the sphere radius and the relaxation rate, can be used to quantitatively estimate 1/T(2) for various combinations of the variables. Effects of diffusion upon image contrast and effects of sphere size change upon relaxation with their possible applications in microvascular dilatation and other areas are then discussed.

2.5.4 coordinates processing and distance measures

Saved DES coordinates were exported from the neuronavigator in the proprietary format Xbrain and converted to mm using a proprietary BrainLab script "Xbrain to points". Spheres with 5 mm radii (Cochereau et al.) were created around each DES coordinate with FSL (Jenkinson et al.) in the same space as the anatomical image used during surgery, then warped to T1 space with ANTs (Avants et al; Tustison et al.) for comparison with the tractography results. Minimum Euclidean distances were calculated between all DES coordinates and all voxels (cortical and subcortical) of the corresponding tractogram in Python v3.8. The DES spheres in each patient's native T1 space were collapsed to their centers of mass (COM) and recreated with the same radii to mitigate deformations resulting from registration.

The following Python packages were used in an automated script in Python v3.8 to measure the minimum Euclidean distances between DES coordinates and tractograms: nibabel v3.2.2 (Brett et al.), numpy v1.22.3 (Harris et al.), scipy v1.4.1 (Virtanen et al.). Distance measures were rounded up to integers (in mm) because increments smaller than a single voxel (1 mm) were not considered meaningful.

### Pore size estimation in axon-mimicking microfibers with diffusion-relaxation MRI [^115CovJD]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

5 Discussion

We evaluated the spherical mean power-law methodand the T 2 -based pore size estimation techniqueusing diffusion-relaxation MRI data acquired in biomimetic phantoms consisting of hollow axon-mimicking microfibers with non-circular cross-sections and different radii distributions. While the T 2 -based pore size estimation technique requires a single high b -value and multiple (at least two) TEs, the spherical mean power-law method relies on a single TE and multiple (at least two) high b -values with very strong diffusion gradients. Notably, the T 2 -based approach has more modest demands on the b- value than the diffusion-based spherical mean power-law technique. However, the T 2 -based estimation approach relies on a calibration step that requires knowledge of the ground-truth radius distribution in specific regions to determine its surface relaxivity.

The linear relationship between the T 2 -based effective radii estimated from the diffusion-relaxation MRI data and the ground truth radius distributions, as depicted in Figures 3–5, highlights the overall agreement between the estimates. However, it is worth noting that the estimation approach assuming a constant surface relaxivity for all phantoms was not accurate for Phantom 3, as evident from Figure 3A. This deviation is attributed to the smaller surface relaxivity estimated for Phantom 3. Consequently, the predicted radius for Phantom 3 was considerably higher, leading to a mismatch between the generated synthetic signal and the measured data, as shown in Figure 3B. The linear correlation coefficient for the estimated effective radii was not statistically significant. However, on removing Phantom 3 from the analysis, the linear correlation coefficient became statistically significant, indicating a strong relationship between the estimated effective radii for the remaining phantoms. The reason behind the discrepancy in surface relaxivity for Phantom 3 remains uncertain. One plausible hypothesis is that, at the time of scanning, Phantom 3 underwent a natural degradation process typical of this type of material, resulting in altered interactions between water molecules and the pore surface. This hypothesis is further supported by the observation that, a few weeks after the MRI acquisitions, the white color of Phantom 3 — unlike the other phantoms — turned to a light white-pink color, indicating a change in its properties. Despite this issue, we decided to include the results of Phantom 3 in our study to provide a comprehensive analysis and present the complete findings.

At any given time, the positions of the four +1/2 defects can also be described by θ i j, which denotes the angle between radii from the vesicle center to each of the six defect pairs, i j. For a tetrahedral configuration, the mean pair angle 〈 θ i j 〉 = 109.5° and for a planer configuration 〈 θ i j 〉 = 120°. It has been demonstrated in an active nematic vesicle that the four +1/2 defects repeatedly oscillate between the tetrahedral and planar configurations and the frequency is set by the activity of the component and the size of the sphere. In contrast, the four defects in the globally jammed vesicle (Fig. 5 a) evolve very slowly and as a consequence, the mean pair angle 〈 θ i j 〉 does not oscillate and stays stable over time (Fig. 5 e). This stable defect configuration is due to the reduction of activity of actin filaments when arrested in a globally jammed state on a sphere. Whether a band or a jammed state form is thus entirely dependent on which way the system chooses to accommodate the fundamental requirement on the total charge. As this four-defect configuration is more likely to form, globally jammed patterns and not bands are the dominant ones at high density and underline the influence a spherical topology can have in shaping collective patterns in this system.

### Improving the sensitivity of cluster-based statistics for functional magnetic resonance imaging data [^117GiDfX]. Human Brain Mapping (2021). Medium credibility.

2.2 Simulation design

The aim of the simulations was to investigate the FA rate control and the sensitivity of different test statistics within the randomization framework in comparison to the current standards in the field. We focused on group‐level analyses comparing two different task conditions. The resting state data were used in two types of simulations: (a) noise‐only simulations using only the resting state data (as performed by Eklund et al. 2016), and (b) simulations in which the resting state data were used as the background signal on top of which we added a stimulus‐evoked signal. When the expected magnitude of the stimulus‐evoked signal was equal in the two task conditions, we could investigate the brain‐level FA rate control of different statistical tests. To investigate the sensitivity profiles of the different statistical tests, we manipulated the (a) between‐condition difference in the expected magnitudes of the evoked signals (denoted as "effect size" in the following), and (b) size of the gray‐matter volume that exhibited this difference (denoted as "spatial extent" in the following). The effect sizes were quantified as the (population‐level) Cohen's d of the between‐condition differences in the signal magnitudes. The values of Cohen's d in our simulation design were 0 (for investigating the brain‐level FA rate control), 0.6, 0.8, 1, and 1.2. The task‐related BOLD signals were added to the resting state data (see Section 2.3) in a cluster of voxels which was defined by a sphere with a radius of 10, 15, or 20 mm centered at MNI coordinate [3–60 30] (see Figure 4). Thus, our simulation design was 5 (effect size) by 3 (spatial extent).

### Nanoscale feedback control of six degrees of freedom of a near-sphere [^114KfqdD]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Manipulating the rotational as well as the translational degrees of freedom of rigid bodies has been a crucial ingredient in diverse areas, from optically controlled micro-robots, navigation, and precision measurements at macroscale to artificial and biological Brownian motors at nanoscale. Here, we demonstrate feedback cooling of all the angular motions of a near-spherical neutral nanoparticle with all the translational motions feedback-cooled to near the ground state. The occupation numbers of the three translational motions are 6 ± 1, 6 ± 1, and 0.69 ± 0.18. A tight, anisotropic optical confinement allows us to clearly observe three angular oscillations and to identify the ratio of two radii to the longest radius with a precision of 0.08%. We develop a thermometry for three angular oscillations and realize feedback cooling of them to temperatures of lower than 0.03K by electrically controlling the electric dipole moment of the nanoparticle.

### Larmor frequency shift from magnetized cylinders with arbitrary orientation distribution [^115eEu8R]. NMR in Biomedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

3 METHODS

3.1 Simulations: validation of modeling

We designed three sets of simulations to validate our theory. We investigated (a) the influence of the size and shape of the mesoscopic Lorentz cavitywhen calculating the mesoscopic averaged Larmor frequency, Equation (8) through Equations (12) and (13), for different microstructural configurations and (b) the accuracy of calculating the MRI Larmor frequency using Equation (21) in a sample with slowly varying magnetic microstructure and run using different inclusion sizes compared with. Finally, we investigated (c) the validity of the proposed mesoscopic kernel, Equation (43), for a distribution of cylinders. All simulations were done in MATLAB (MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA).

3.1.1 Random packing of cylinders or spheres

Non‐overlapping cylinders or spheres were packed in a sample represented by a cubic volume of side length, with radiidrawn from a gamma distribution with mean and standard deviation (SD). The positions(parameterized as in Appendix B.1 for cylinders) were randomly generated from a uniform distribution, and the packing was stopped once the inclusions occupied a chosen volume fraction in the sample. For cylinders, various levels of orientation dispersion were achieved by only generating cylinders within an allowed polar‐angle range, set by a given cut‐offThis generated a uniform distribution of orientations up toThe sample was subsequently discretized on a 3D grid, with a resolution set by the number of grid points. The indicator functionon the discretized grid was then Fourier transformed to yield the indicator functionin k ‐space, which in turn was used to compute the correlation function, Equation (19). We computed the local Larmor frequency, Equation (1), by multiplyingby the dicretized dipole kernel, Equation (3), and Fourier transforming back to image space. The mesoscopic dipole tensor, Equation (18), was computed by integrating the product of the dipole kernel and the correlation function, and dividing the result by the volume fractionof the discretized grid. The external field is normalized so, and chosen to be alongto maximize effect size.

C, The magnetic microstructure has been nulled within, and the frequency is calculated at the point. The frequency is induced by an external field.

3.1.3 Simulation (b). The voxel‐averaged Larmor frequency in a sample with varying microstructure

The purpose of the next simulation was to validate Equation (21) describing the MRI‐measured Larmor frequency when the sample consists of a slowly varying magnetic microstructure, and quantify the error we obtain when (b1) we filter the measured Larmor frequency (as described in Equation 8), (b2) neglect the sampling PSF (as explained in Appendix A.2) and finally (b3) partition the magnetic microstructure in order to compute the macroscopic contribution (cf. Equation 57 in Appendix A.2) to the measured Larmor frequency.

Figure 5 illustrates the sample used to test the error from these three points. We constructed a sample consisting of 27 cubes, denoted, stacked(blue square in Figure 5A). Each cube had side length(see Figure 5) and contained a configuration of cylinders with a randomly chosen axially symmetric orientation dispersion and volume fraction(i.e. different for each cube). Susceptibility variations were introduced by randomly choosing a normalized microscopic susceptibilityfor each cube (in reality, but as we only consider field ratios the absolute magnitude is irrelevant). The sample was further partitioned into smaller cubeswith center points denotedand with side length, i.e. one‐third of the larger cubes(indicated by the orange square in Figure 5A). This construction ensured a sample with a more slowly varying microstructure across, as seen at, since the abrupt edges between the cubesare far away. Thus, every large cubewith a distinct magnetic microstructure contained 27 smaller cubes, and so the entire sample was partitioned into 729 cubesstacked.

### Capturing nematic order on tissue surfaces of arbitrary geometry [^1146mDYU]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

For convenience, we next approximated the aggregate surface by a sphere in order to obtain a regular triangular mesh (see Methods - Surface points and normal vectors). The regular grid with equal spacing between the nematic directors facilitated a more straightforward analysis of the topological charge of the defects (Fig. 3 b). This approximation does not materially change either the location of the topological defects or the wider texture of the nematic director field; regions of high nematic order (on the right of the aggregate in this perspective) and regions of disorder (on the left of the aggregate in this perspective) are similarly located between aggregates and spheres (Fig. 3 a, b).

We investigated defect proliferation on ten multicellular aggregates of different sizes, limiting ourselves to those with radii < 50 μm, since for larger aggregates, high light absorption and scattering of the fluorescence signal occur in deep layers of the z -stack. In the absence of composite defects with charge ± 1, which we did not observe in any of our analyzed aggregates, the topology of the sphere implies the minimal number of defects is four, each with +1/2 charge, for a total charge of +2. Additional defects must come in pairs with charge ± 1/2 in order to meet the topological constraint on the total defect charge. Theoretical models have suggested that the number of defects correlates linearly with the surface area of the sphere in a turbulent regime characterized by additional defects. Accordingly, we plotted the total number of defects against the surface area of the aggregate (Fig. 3 c) with a coarse-graining factor of k cg = 1.2 (see Methods - 3D nematic director on the surface). Our data indicate that the number of defects increases with the aggregate surface area, with a slope of m = 63 × 10 −5 defects/μm 2 of the linear regression, supporting previous theoretical work. Increasing the coarse-graining radius resulted in a reduction of the number of ± 1/2 defect pairs, setting an effective cutoff, in terms of surface area, for observing more than four ± 1/2 defects (Fig. S3a, b in the Supplementary Information - S3 Defect density on spheres). All multicellular aggregates analyzed had, as expected, at least four +1/2 defects and a total topological change of +2.

### Pore size estimation in axon-mimicking microfibers with diffusion-relaxation MRI [^1168FtLy]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

This study aims to evaluate two distinct approaches for fiber radius estimation using diffusion-relaxation MRI data acquired in biomimetic microfiber phantoms that mimic hollow axons. The methods considered are the spherical mean power-law approach and a T 2 -based pore size estimation technique.

Theory and Methods

A general diffusion-relaxation theoretical model for the spherical mean signal from water molecules within a distribution of cylinders with varying radii was introduced, encompassing the evaluated models as particular cases. Additionally, a new numerical approach was presented for estimating effective radii (i.e. MRI-visible mean radii) from the ground truth radii distributions, not reliant on previous theoretical approximations and adaptable to various acquisition sequences. The ground truth radii were obtained from scanning electron microscope images.

Results

Both methods show a linear relationship between effective radii estimated from MRI data and ground-truth radii distributions, although some discrepancies were observed. The spherical mean power-law method overestimated fiber radii. Conversely, the T 2 -based method exhibited higher sensitivity to smaller fiber radii, but faced limitations in accurately estimating the radius in one particular phantom, possibly because of material-specific relaxation changes.

Conclusion

The study demonstrates the feasibility of both techniques to predict pore sizes of hollow microfibers. The T 2 -based technique, unlike the spherical mean power-law method, does not demand ultra-high diffusion gradients, but requires calibration with known radius distributions. This research contributes to the ongoing development and evaluation of neuroimaging techniques for fiber radius estimation, highlights the advantages and limitations of both methods, and provides datasets for reproducible research.

### Interplay between spherical confinement and particle shape on the self-assembly of rounded cubes [^114sSBDR]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Analysis of defects

It is not possible to tile the surface of a sphere with a square grid of squares without introducing topological defects. The cubes in our simulations and experiments were nearly always found to align with a square face towards the spherical shell and will thus also form topological defects. The topological defects are characterized by their winding number, which is 90° or π /2 in this case (the rotational symmetry of a square), see Fig. 2e, f. To obtain the curvature of a sphere a total topological charge of 4 π or at least eight topological defects are required. To automate the analysis of the topological defects on the surface of the SPs, we analyzed the orientation of the nanocubes with respect to their neighbors. The topological defects can be identified by tracing a closed chain of particles and tracking the smallest rotation to rotate a particle to the orientation of the next particle in the chain. This is illustrated in Fig. 2f, the particles marked with yellow arrows form a chain and the yellow arrows show the orientation of the particle. If one starts tracing the orientation at the top left particle and follow the chain until one is back at this particle, the orientation has changed by 90° (π /2). This means that this chain surrounds a topological defect of charge π /2. In Fig. 2, we show one of these topological defects on the surface for α = 0.8. The red particles in Fig. 2f of the main text are the particles for which the chain formed by their neighbors surrounds one of these topological defects. The topological defect is a point on the surface of the sphere that lies between these red particles.

Quantitative imaging metrics — common sources of systematic errors in imaging and analysis include six categories with representative examples: technical issues during acquisition (differences in hardware and software, acquisition protocol, signal-to-noise ratio, and resolution), biased sampling of structure for analysis (comparison of mismatched airways), failure to define an appropriate reference space, issues with segmentation or registration, inaccurate assumptions or simplifications (assuming alveolar airspaces are spheres), and failure to consider spatiotemporal and biological heterogeneity (anatomical or gravitational gradients in tissue density, ventilation, and perfusion).

### Experience of euclidean geometry sculpts the development and dynamics of rodent hippocampal sequential cell assemblies [^114vTRJa]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Euclidean space is the fabric of the world we live in. Whether and how geometric experience shapes our spatial-temporal representations of the world remained unknown. We deprived male rats of experience with crucial features of Euclidean geometry by rearing them inside spheres, and compared activity of large hippocampal neuronal ensembles during navigation and sleep with that of cuboid cage-reared controls. Sphere-rearing from birth permitted emergence of accurate neuronal ensemble spatial codes and preconfigured and plastic time-compressed neuronal sequences. However, sphere-rearing led to diminished individual place cell tuning, more similar neuronal mapping of different track ends/corners, and impaired pattern separation and plasticity of multiple linear tracks, coupled with reduced preconfigured sleep network repertoires. Subsequent experience with multiple linear environments over four days largely reversed these effects. Thus, early-life experience with Euclidean geometry enriches the hippocampal repertoire of preconfigured neuronal patterns selected toward unique representation and discrimination of multiple linear environments.

### Universality in long-distance geometry and quantum complexity [^116ovxd2]. Nature (2023). Excellent credibility.

This implies that we can approximate the operatorwith a total cost of about. This operator agrees with our target operatorat leading order in z, and has an inner-product error of about z 2. This can be improved to z 3 by using the next order in the Suzuki–Trotter expansion, but going to even higher orders becomes prohibitively expensive. It is at this point that we make our heuristic step. In the Euclidean group example, we saw that the complexity geometry has so many degrees of freedom that by making minor deformations of the path we can correct small errors at small extra cost, in a way that is not captured by any finite order of the Suzuki–Trotter expansion, and is instead an emergent feature in the IR. Compared with the SU(2) example in the section ' Berger sphere ', the task of compiling in U(2 N) is complicated by the fact that there are many more directions in which to err; on the other hand, there are correspondingly more directions in which we can wiggle the path to eliminate the error, and as a statistical matter, we expect that to dominate. If the small inner-product errors can be corrected by wiggling the path, then we can synthesizefor z < 1 at cost k n 2 (k). To generateat larger values of z, the triangle inequality (for any) guarantees that the complexity grows no faster than linearly with coefficient k n 2 (k). This argument heuristically shows that the binomial metric is in the same universality class as the infinite-cliff metric, and therefore upper-bounds the critical schedule:The upper-bound equation (17) holds at all but the largest k, where the analysis becomes unreliable. Note also that although the binomial metric does not have a curvature as small as the exponential metric, it is still very moderate ∣ κ ∣ ≤ O (N) compared to the cliff metric. The reasoning that leads to equation (17) is heuristic, because to eliminate error it appeals to a statistical argument. In ref. it is shown that there is a weaker result that can be proved. The study also shows that any unitary that can be reached with a path that in the binomial metric has a lengthcan be approximated to within inner-product error ϵ by a path that in the infinite-cliff metric has a lengthOur conjectures imply that this can be improved from polynomial to linear-with-additive-constant and from approximate to exact.

### Experience of euclidean geometry sculpts the development and dynamics of rodent hippocampal sequential cell assemblies [^113VCFVb]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Finally, extended experience with linear environments over four days largely reversed the effects of sphere-rearing. Interestingly, the effects of this spatial deprivation extended to new, not yet experienced linear contexts, indicating that early-life experience of geometry sculpts the neuronal ensemble rules for representing novel spaces. We hypothesize this rapid shift in sphere-reared rats toward accurate depiction of geometric linearity was facilitated by our very selective deprivation from geometric linearity, which spared animal locomotion and age-dependent network maturation, by the evolutionary and ecological affordancesof linear space for rats, and by the presence of preconfigured preplay. While cubic shapes might not occur frequently in the wild habitat of rodents, spatial features of cubic shapes are ubiquitous in Euclidean world where rodents (and humans) live. Therefore, these spatial features could further configure the hippocampal representation of space via their direct experience in addition to the inferred innate concepts of space. Given the role of hippocampus in representing conceptual spacesand sequencesin adult rodents, our findings on the impact of experience of geometric linearity on hippocampal neurodevelopment might extend to representation of broader conceptual domains later in life. Whether the development of a preconfigured adult hippocampal network repertoire for multiple spatial experiences is influenced by experience specifically within a critical period earlier in life, similar to sensory brain networks, and which spatial features of Euclidean geometry are critical to that development remain to be determined.

### Pore size estimation in axon-mimicking microfibers with diffusion-relaxation MRI [^116vAzqG]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

On comparing the effective radii obtained from the T 2 -based and diffusion-based techniques, Figures 3–5 and 6, it is evident that these methods exhibit different sensitivities to spatial scales. Notably, the T 2 -based approach demonstrates a higher sensitivity to smaller radii, resulting in smaller effective radii than the diffusion-based method. To further support this observation, we refer to Figure C2 in Appendix C, where we present plots of the diffusion and relaxation signals as a function of the radius for the specific acquisition protocols used in this study. Consistently with our findings, these plots highlight that the T 2 -based method has a lower resolution limit for detecting small cylindrical fibers than the diffusion-based method.

Nevertheless, the radii estimated by the spherical mean power-law method showed less variability.

Another contribution of this study is the numerical approach to estimate the effective radius from the underlying radius distribution. This approach offers several advantages as it does not rely on specific theoretical approximations. It can be applied more universally to different acquisition sequences, MRI contrasts, and materials with varying pore sizes. By comparing the generated synthetic signals with the measured data, this numerical approach allows us to assess the ability of the used relaxation or diffusion models to explain the observed data. It is worth noting that previous studies proposed an expression for estimating the effective radius in dMRI based on the assumptions that the dMRI signal from the intra-fiber compartment can be approximated by the wide pulse or Neuman limit and that the diffusion model can be well-approximated by a first-order Taylor expansion, resulting in r eff-SEM = (⟨ r 6 ⟩/ ⟨ r 2 ⟩) 1/4. However, these assumptions only hold for a population of microfibers with radii smaller than 2.5 μm and do not apply to our study. In Figure C1 of Appendix C, we conducted a supplementary analysis revealing that the signals derived from these approximations do not align with those predicted by the van Gelderen model across the entire range of measured radii in the phantoms. As a result, the new numerical approach proposed in this study becomes crucial for accurately determining the effective radius from the radius distribution.

### An improved method for susceptibility and radius quantification of cylindrical objects from MRI [^116RQojt]. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (2015). Low credibility.

A new method is developed to measure the magnetic susceptibilities and radii of small cylinder-like objects at arbitrary orientations accurately. This method for most biological substances only requires a standard gradient echo sequence with one or two echo times, depending on the orientation of an object relative to the main magnetic field. For objects oriented at the magic angle, however, this method is not applicable. As a byproduct of this method, the cross-sectional area as well as signals inside and outside the object can be determined. The uncertainty of each measurement is estimated from the error propagation method. Partial volume, dephasing, and phase aliasing effects are naturally included in the equations of this method. A number of simulations, phantom, and pilot in-vivo human studies are carried out to validate the theory. When the maximal phase value at the boundary of a given cylindrical object is larger than 3 radians, and the phase inside the object is more than 1 radian, the susceptibility can be accurately quantified within 15%. The radius of the object can be determined to subpixel accuracy. This is the case when the signal-to-noise ratio inside the object is about 6:1 or higher and the radius of the object is about one pixel or larger. These conditions are realistic when considering medullary and pial veins for example.

### CELLDOSE: a monte carlo code to assess electron dose distribution – S values for 131I in spheres of various sizes [^116wR9Ap]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Monte Carlo simulation can be particularly suitable for modeling the microscopic distribution of energy received by normal tissues or cancer cells and for evaluating the relative merits of different radiopharmaceuticals. We used a new code, CELLDOSE, to assess electron dose for isolated spheres with radii varying from 2,500 mum down to 0.05 mum, in which (131)I is homogeneously distributed.

Methods

All electron emissions of (131)I were considered, including the whole beta(- 131)I spectrum, 108 internal conversion electrons, and 21 Auger electrons. The Monte Carlo track-structure code used follows all electrons down to an energy threshold E(cutoff) = 7.4 eV.

Results

Calculated S values were in good agreement with published analytic methods, lying in between reported results for all experimental points. Our S values were also close to other published data using a Monte Carlo code. Contrary to the latter published results, our results show that dose distribution inside spheres is not homogeneous, with the dose at the outmost layer being approximately half that at the center. The fraction of electron energy retained within the spheres decreased with decreasing radius (r): 87.1% for r = 2,500 mum, 8.73% for r = 50 mum, and 1.18% for r = 5 mum. Thus, a radioiodine concentration that delivers a dose of 100 Gy to a micrometastasis of 2,500 mum radius would deliver 10 Gy in a cluster of 50 mum and only 1.4 Gy in an isolated cell. The specific contribution from Auger electrons varied from 0.25% for the largest sphere up to 76.8% for the smallest sphere.

Conclusion

The dose to a tumor cell will depend on its position in a metastasis. For the treatment of very small metastases, (131)I may not be the isotope of choice. When trying to kill isolated cells or a small cluster of cells with (131)I, it is important to get the iodine as close as possible to the nucleus to get the enhancement factor from Auger electrons. The Monte Carlo code CELLDOSE can be used to assess the electron map deposit for any isotope.

### Pyrocarbon interposition shoulder arthroplasty: preliminary results from a prospective multicenter study at 2 years of follow-up [^115nFokK]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The concept of free interposition arthroplasty proved successful for small joints of the hand, wrist, and foot, particularly after the use of implants coated with pyrocarbon, which enhanced their tribologic and elastic properties. The present study reports preliminary outcomes of a pyrocarbon-coated interposition shoulder arthroplasty (PISA) implant.

Methods

This was a prospective study of 67 consecutive patients who underwent shoulder PISA at 9 centers. The mean age at surgery was 51 years, with only 12 patients older than 60 years. The indications for surgery were primary glenohumeral arthritis in 42, avascular necrosis in 13, and secondary arthritis in 12 patients.

Results

Revision surgery was performed in 7 patients (10.4%), 2 (3.0%) were lost to follow-up, and the outcome assessments were incomplete in 3 (4.4%). This left 55 patients, aged 49.3 ± 12.0 years, with complete outcomes assessments at a mean follow-up of 26.8 ± 3.4 months. The Constant score improved from 34.1 ± 15.1 preoperatively to 66.1 ± 19.7 postoperatively. The radiographic findings revealed erosion in 6 glenoids and thinning of 3 humeral tuberosities.

Conclusion

In a cohort of young arthritic patients, PISA renders clinical scores and implant survival comparable to those of hemishoulder arthroplasty but remain inferior to those results reported for total shoulder arthroplasty. The study enabled identification of contraindications and potential causes of failure that wererelated to the concept of free interposition and smaller radius of curvature of the sphere. Until long-term results are available, this type of innovative implant should remain to be tested in a few specialized shoulder centers.

### Topologically controlled synthesis of active colloidal bipeds [^117268Fh]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Topological growth control allows to produce a narrow distribution of outgrown colloidal rods with defined and adjustable length. We use an external magnetic field to assemble paramagnetic colloidal spheres into colloidal rods of a chosen length. The rods reside above a metamorphic hexagonal magnetic pattern. The periodic repetition of specific loops of the orientation of an applied external field renders paramagnetic colloidal particles and their assemblies into active bipeds that walk on the pattern. The metamorphic patterns allow the robust and controlled polymerization of single colloids to bipeds of a desired length. The colloids are exposed to this fixed external control loop that causes multiple simultaneous responses: Small bipeds and single colloidal particles interpret the external magnetic loop as an order to walk toward the active zone, where they assemble and polymerize. Outgrown bipeds interpret the same loop as an order to walk away from the active zone. The topological transition occurs solely for the growing biped and nothing is changed in the environment nor in the magnetic control loop. As in many biological systems the decision of a biped that reached its outgrown length to walk away from the reaction site is made internally, not externally.

### Measuring the size of individual particles from three-dimensional imaging experiments [^117BuHAw]. Nature Communications (2012). Medium credibility.

Often experimentalists study particulate samples that are nominally monodisperse. In reality, many samples have a polydispersity of 4–10%. At the level of an individual particle, the consequences of this polydispersity are unknown as it is difficult to measure an individual particle size from images of a dense sample. Here we propose a method to estimate individual particle radii from three-dimensional data of the particle positions. We first validate our method with simulations. We then apply our method to experimental data of colloidal suspensions observed with confocal microscopy. We demonstrate that we can recover the full particle size distribution in situ. Finally, we use our method to study the relationship between homogeneous colloidal crystal nucleation and particle sizes. We show that nucleation occurs in regions that are more monodisperse than average.

### Experience of euclidean geometry sculpts the development and dynamics of rodent hippocampal sequential cell assemblies [^112eZ8eq]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Our findings provided three lines of evidence for the role that early-life physical and visual experience with geometry had in sculpting hippocampal neuronal circuits crucial for spatial representation and memory formation. First, geometric deprivation reduced both the intrinsic repertoire of preconfigured neuronal ensembles and their recruitment as distinct ensembles across multiple future linear tracks, resulting in impaired plasticity for multiple experiences. The relatively reduced neuronal ensemble repertoire in the pre-experience sleep after sphere-rearing likely contributed towards the reduced network performance to discriminate multiple linear environments expressed as deficits in pattern separation. Meanwhile, network competenceof sphere-reared rats to represent a sequential trajectory preplay prior to their very first encounter with a linear track developed a priori. This indicates that innate intrinsic developmental programs and/or experience with various aspects of the external world, other than Euclidean geometry, were sufficient to support the developmental emergence of time-compressed sequential patterns of neuronal firing previously assumed to require prior experience with geometric linearity. These findings suggest that crucial aspects of higher order ensemble representations of space-time emerge according to Kantian apriorismrather than the predicaments of British empiricism. How intrinsic developmental programsand experiences with curved space enable the emergence of network (pre)configuration expressed as preplay for future novel trajectories in linear environmentsremains to be determined.

### A quantum spin-probe molecular microscope [^111KnZnE]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

MRI measurement and structure determination

We now illustrate the entire protocol using a non-trivial example — the rapamycin molecule (C 51 H 79 NO 13). This particular molecule, in the mass range ∼1 kDa, is around three orders of magnitude larger than that considered in proposals for 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopic approaches. In our approach, once a sufficient level of decoupling is assumed, it is possible to simulate the entire structure determination protocol. We apply the sequence to acquire 1 H and 13 C nuclear density data and obtain the molecular coordinates for the two atomic species. The spectral data was sampled at multiple orientations of the background magnetic field as depicted in Fig. 4a (Methods section, 3D imaging protocol), and contains the nuclear density of the target molecule in dipolar-slice space — numerical inversion into cartesian space (Fig. 4b, c) yields the molecular nuclear 3D densities shown in Fig. 5b, c. The 1 H and 13 C atomic positions in the rapamycin molecule are readily observable by inspection of contours of 50 and 75% contrast around 3D density peaks having distinct spherical shapes. The atomic coordinates are reconstructed by thresholding local maxima in the nuclear densities above 90% (crosses, Fig. 5b, c), and estimating the uncertainty in the atomic positions by average of the full width at half maximum (FWHM) in three axial cross-sections of the 3D density peaks. Figure 5d shows the atomic site coordinates with the colour scale conveying the spatial uncertainties (corresponding to the widths of the density peaks) in atomic positions ranging from 0.4 Å to 1.4 Å. We note that these coordinates are derived directly from the density image, without potential energy minimization or other post-processing. Comparison of the reconstructed atomic coordinates to the true molecular coordinates, gives an average statistical variation of 0.5 Å, represented as the radius of the spheres in Fig. 5d. Using this simple data collection strategy, the total acquisition time amounts to ∼175 h under realistic experimental conditions to image the 1 H structure of rapamycin (and twice as long for the 13 C structure). These calculations assumed probe and nuclear target coherence parameters T 2p = 50 ms, T 2n = 50 ms and a detection sequence of total length t = 8 ms, with shot noise limit given by M S = 2000 single shot measurements per slice over 150 slices for each of the 264 B 0 orientations (for details see Methods section, parameters for the molecule example). With the outlined parameters, the protocol provides a hemispherical imaging volume of ∼8 nm in radial extent above the probe–sufficient for imaging proteins across cell membranes (∼4 nm thickness). Where larger imaging volumes are required, it may be possible to augment the protocol with additional external (classical) gradient fields, however, with increasing probe-target distance detection is more limited. The variation in 3D density resolution along the z axis is consistent with the simple constant sampling methodology used in this example, where the frequency sweep steps are constant yet the dipole strength gradient is not. Thus, the results from this rudimentary sampling procedure should serve as an indicator of the upper limit on the total acquisition time and resolution achievable.

AFM mechanical imaging and simulations

AFM results about indentation on single spherical particles exposed from hydrogel matrix level for 0.15 μ-gel (Fig. 2), 1 μ-gel (Fig. 3), and 2.5 μ-gel (Fig. 4). Figure 2 evidences a partially embedded PS sphere residing at the top of hydrogel matrix level. Lateral size of inclusion in Fig. 2a is overestimated because of convolution effect with colloidal probe (R = 2.5 μm). The heterogeneity in Fig. 2b–d depends on AFM tip, after vertical contact, transferring force to the hard inclusion, which is then acting as an apparent new indenter. Deviations from Young's modulus of surrounding matrix are expected and caused by a combination of mismatches of contact area and indenter radius when fitting using standard contact mechanics model (Hertz model in this case). Analysis was performed by dividing the indentation curve in small intervals and fitting them using Hertz model in order to appreciate the variability of apparent Young's modulus. Apparent Young's moduli vs. indentation evaluated at the top of exposed sphere, shown in Fig. 2c–e, can be summarized in three parts: (1) Initial overestimation of Young's modulus due to force transferred to inclusion having non-zero contact area on gel matrix, (2) starting contact area becomes negligible in comparison with new contact area experienced by filler indenting gel: apparent modulus responds depending on radius of probe and filler (see Eq. (3)), (3) at large indentation apparent modulus reach matrix value for filler smaller than probe, or remain overestimated for filler bigger than probe. In the second trend, when filler indenting the gel effect dominates on starting contact area, the apparent modulus is obtained considering the spherical geometry and radius of the filler, as depicted in Eq. (3):where E app, E gel, R tip, and R fil are, respectively, apparent Young's modulus, Young's modulus of surrounding hydrogel, radius of colloidal probe, and radius of spherical filler. The equation trend was confirmed by FEM previously. The behavior for large indentation depends also on the ratio between sizes of probe and filler: for smaller fillers, modulus is reaching matrix value because the probe is dominantly in contact with gel matrix. Also in this case, the contact area between probe and gel is the key in interpretation of effects as long as most of the probe surface area is in contact with hydrogel and filler effect is negligible. For big filler particles, the probe is unable to contact the gel causing a constant overestimation of apparent modulus and following Eq. (3).

### Charge of clustered microparticles measured in spatial plasma afterglows follows the smallest enclosing sphere model [^114v8zZA]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Cluster detection

The technique applied in this paper to determine in situ the size, mass, and cluster configuration of the particles was based on several relations which are discussed and experimentally verified below.

The drag force on a single microparticle is described by the Epstein formula when the mean free path of the atom–atom collisions λ n is much larger than the radius of the particle r p (i.e. the free molecular flow regime), and when the particle speed v s is small compared with the thermal velocity of the gas particles v th, n The coefficient δ accounts for the microscopic mechanism of the collisions between the particles and the gas atoms. For perfect specular reflections δ = 1, whereas for diffuse reflections δ = 1.442 for a thermal nonconducting particle.

The drag force on a cluster consisting of N p particles in the free molecular regime can be quantified using the dynamic shape factor χ ν aswhere d ve is the volume equivalent diameter defined as. In the literature, numerous experiments reported on the dynamical shape factor in the continuum regime χ c –. In order to calculate χ ν from χ c, the adjusted diameter was used, defined as. Using the definition ϕ = d a /(2 r p), χ ν can be expressed by

The drag force acting on clusters depends on their orientation with respect to the flow. To analyze the clusters' orientation, the torque acting on a cylinder in the free molecular flow regime is givenHere, a and l are the radius and length of the cylinder, v c the velocity relative to the flow, β the angle between the long axis of the cylinder and the flow direction, and σ t the tangential momentum accommodation factor.

The relations above are valid in the free molecular flow regime, which is the case for the current experiments. Figure 7 presents the measured vertical velocity of singlets as a function of the gas pressure in the absence of plasma. The other experimental conditions are identical to the ones described at the beginning of the "Methods" section. The error bars in v y are determined by calculating the standard deviation of the mean, and in p by experimental limitations. Furthermore, Fig. 7 shows that the relation that could be obtained for v s using Eq. (1) perfectly matched the experiments using δ = 1.442 and ρ p = 1.61 × 10 3 kg m −3. Therefore, it can be concluded that the drag force was indeed described by the free molecular flow relation given in Eq. (3).

### A colloidal viewpoint on the sausage catastrophe and the finite sphere packing problem [^116ELP7j]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

It is commonly believed that the most efficient way to pack a finite number of equal-sized spheres is by arranging them tightly in a cluster. However, mathematicians have conjectured that a linear arrangement may actually result in the densest packing. Here, our combined experimental and simulation study provides a physical realization of the finite sphere packing problem by studying arrangements of colloids in a flaccid lipid vesicle. We map out a state diagram displaying linear, planar, and cluster conformations of spheres, as well as bistable states which alternate between cluster-plate and plate-linear conformations due to membrane fluctuations. Finally, by systematically analyzing truncated polyhedral packings, we identify clusters of 56 ≤ N ≤ 70 number of spheres, excluding N = 57 and 63, that pack more efficiently than linear arrangements.

RESULTS

SEM Characterization of Phantom Microstructure and Stability

SEM images (Fig. 2 a, phantom A) show that the spheres tend to group together, indicating that the phantom's microstructure is not simply a packing of discrete idealized spheres, but consists of extended clumps of spheres. The mean ± SD of the baseline radii was 5.7 ± 0.7 µm. The CoV of the mean post‐immersion values was 4.2%, and the maximum difference in means between the first post‐immersion time point and subsequent points was 0.46 µm. Averaging over the mean values at each post‐immersion time point gave R o = 5.2 ± 0.2 µm, which was taken as the ground truth outer sphere radius for phantom A (Fig. 2 b). For phantom B, measurements over 1 month gave a CoV of 4.7% and R o = 5.6 ± 0.3 µm. Comparing R o values for the two phantoms at equivalent post‐immersion time points gave a mean difference of 0.4 µm.

### Exploring the colloid-to-polymer transition for ultra-low crosslinked microgels from three to two dimensions [^116N6HzT]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

The microgels have a total radius in the swollen state (light blue circles) of 126 ± 1 nm with R c = 96.1 ± 0.5 nm and 2 σ s = 29.8 ± 0.3 nm. The fuzziness of the shell of the ULC microgels is less pronounced as compared to regularly crosslinked microgels, but still the ULC microgels have the typical fuzzy sphere architecture. Thus, the polymer distribution within ULC microgels is more homogeneous than for microgels synthesized with additional crosslinker. The average mesh size of the polymer network is estimated to be 24 ± 1 nm, which is significatively larger than for regular crosslinked microgels (Supplementary Note 5). This means that even if ULCs have a more homogeneous crosslinker distribution, the absolute number of crosslinks is lower compared to regular crosslinked microgels. The polydispersity is 11.3 ± 0.7%. The ULC microgels collapse to 41 ± 1 nm and the fit shows that the external fuzziness disappears once the temperature is above the VPTT of pNIPAM. For collapsed ULC microgels, the fuzzy sphere model produces the same results as a fit performed with the simple hard sphere model (Supplementary Note 4).

Sizes and polydispersities obtained by SANS agree with the hydrodynamic radii obtained below and above the VPTT by the analysis of dynamic light scattering (DLS) data shown in the Supplementary Note 2, 134 ± 1 nm and 44.8 ± 0.2 nm, respectively. Estimating the amount of crosslinks within the polymeric network is difficult. A possible method is to compare the swelling ratios of the microgels synthesized with and without crosslinker agent. This comparison shows that the ULC microgels contain less crosslinks than microgels with comparable size and synthesized with low amounts of crosslinker agent (Supplementary Note 3).

### Microdosimetry of electron microbeams [^113zQKy3]. Radiation Research (2004). Low credibility.

Track structures of 25, 50 and 80 keV primary electrons, simulated by the detailed-history Monte Carlo method, were analyzed for the frequency distributions of energy deposited in spheres with a diameter of 1 microm, placed in a cylindrically symmetrical array around the projected initial direction of the primary electron. The frequency mean of specific energy, the dose mean of lineal energy, and the parameters of lognormal functions fit to the dose distributions were calculated as a function of beam penetration and radial distance from the projected beam axis. Given these data, the stochastics of dose and radiation quality for micrometer-scale sites targeted by a medium-energy electron microbeam can be predicted as a function of the site's location relative to the beam entry point.

### Charge of clustered microparticles measured in spatial plasma afterglows follows the smallest enclosing sphere model [^115r6kvL]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

The plasma-induced charge of non-spherical microparticles is a crucial parameter in complex plasma physics, aerosol science and astrophysics. Yet, the literature describes this charge by two competing models, neither of which has been experimentally verified or refuted. Here we offer experimental proof that the charge on a two-particle cluster (doublet) in the spatial afterglow of a low-pressure plasma equals the charge that would be obtained by the smallest enclosing sphere and that it should therefore not be based on its geometrical capacitance but rather on the capacitance of its smallest enclosing sphere. To support this conclusion, the size, mass and charge of single particles (singlets) and doublets are measured with high precision. The measured ratio between the plasma-afterglow-induced charges on doublets and singlets is compared to both models and shows perfect agreement with the predicted ratio using the capacitance of the smallest enclosing sphere, while being significantly dissimilar to the predicted ratio based on the particle's geometrical capacitance.

### Controlling dispersion forces between small particles with artificially created random light fields [^113CL7kr]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

which can be shown to be equivalent to equation (11) in ref.in the absence of absorption. In the weak scattering limit

The interaction energy far from resonance is attractive but always much smaller than k B T for realistic power densities, whereas at resonance the polarizability is purely imaginary (at resonance, that is, α 2 < 0), which leads to an effective repulsion. The latter was shown to play a key role in understanding the collective behaviour of optical-trapped neutral atoms. Plasmonic or polaritonic nanoparticles show a high real and imaginary polarizability close to a resonance, but this can lead to a significant increase of the temperature. Non-absorbing semiconductor nanoparticles, with relatively high refractive index, or colloidal dielectric micron-sized particles would offer an attractive laboratory to verify our predictions. Semiconductor particles, for example, silicon (Si) spheres with index of refraction ∼3.5 and radius ∼200 nm, present strong electric and magnetic dipolar resonances in telecom and near-infrared frequencies (that is, at wavelengths 1.2–2 μm) without spectral overlap with quadrupolar and higher-order resonances. Assuming that the scattering by these Si particles can be described by just dipolar electric and magnetic fields, it is possible to obtain an exact closed expression for the interaction potential, equation (3), in terms of the electric and magnetic polarizabilities (see Supplementary Notes 4 and 5). Figure 1d, g illustrates how a monochromatic random illumination induces a pair potential between two identical 230-nm-radius Si nanospheres, which can be tuned from attractive off-resonance (λ ∼2 μm) to strongly repulsive when the external wavelength is tuned near the first Mie's magnetic resonance (λ ∼1.6 μm).

a, b Initial surface reconstruction: a We use a few points in the initial stereo-deflectometry overlap region to estimate the initial radiiand centersof cornea and sclera to construct an initial 2-sphere model. The normalscalculated via deflectometry do not match with the normalsof the initial sphere models. b We optimize the centers and radii of the initial two-sphere model by expanding the evaluation region to the whole measurement area of both cameras (the red part is the overlap region, orange part is covered by one camera only). New estimatesfor radii and centers are obtained by minimizing the angular difference between all pairs ofand(see Eq. (6)). c, d Refinement: c We use the obtained 2-sphere model as an initial guess and calculate a new surface representation via iterative deflectometry normal integration. After this step, the resulting surface parts are not necessarily spherical anymore (in accordance with real human eyes). d When back-traced, the newly obtained normals do not meet at two distinct center points anymore. However, assuming the human eye is rotationally symmetric, the normals still meet along its optical axis, which is updated accordingly and used to calculate the gaze.

### Colloidal crystals with diamond symmetry at optical lengthscales [^1139tnzr]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Structure and incidence of DD crystals

Many DD crystallites we observe have the form of a cuboctahedron having square (100) and triangular (111) faces, shown in Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. 1, and contain order 10 4 microspheres. Crystallites sediment and typically come to rest on a flat facet, aligning the focal plane with the faceting lattice directions. The diamond structure is determined from images that show the expected lattice symmetry, orientation and spacing when the focal plane is parallel to (100) and (111) facets. Moreover, the two different particle species consistently show the same lattice symmetry, orientation and spacing, indicating our crystallites consist of two interpenetrating, identical diamond lattices, see Methods. Other DD crystallites are somewhat less regularly shaped and display prominent faces normal to (211) lattice directions. The lattice here resembles a rectangular array of doublets (foreshortened pairs of spheres), that also closely matches computer-generated models for the DD lattice along the (211) direction, in both colour channels, shown in Fig. 3. A larger set of DD crystal micrographs are displayed in Supplementary Figs 2 and 3. A large number of alternative structures were examined to see if they could explain our images (see Methods for listing), none were even able to qualitatively capture the results, let alone do so with the correct lattice spacings.

We find experimentally that the occurrence of DD crystallites requires the particle diameters to differ slightly (σ A / σ B = 0.96, 0.88 or 0.85, never for σ A / σ B = 1), have strong unlike interactions, U AB ≫ U BB, weak interactions between the larger spheres, U BB > 0, and show no dependence on those between the smaller spheres, U AA. The observations regarding the interactions suggest that contacts between the larger spheres are essential to DD crystal formation and stability, while contacts between the smaller spheres are not. Even under the most favourable conditions, however, the majority (> 80%) of crystallites formed are isostructural to CsCl, as expected theoretically and reported previously for same-sized spheres; the incidence of DD crystals under different conditions is summarized in Supplementary Table 1. Reproducibility was excellent; all dozen experiments satisfying the conditions above, across several different particle formulations yielded DD crystals.

### Colloid science: non-spherical bubbles [^11598Hbx]. Nature (2005). Excellent credibility.

Surface tension gives gas bubbles their perfect spherical shape by minimizing the surface area for a given volume. Here we show that gas bubbles and liquid drops can exist in stable, non-spherical shapes if the surface is covered, or 'armoured', with a close-packed monolayer of particles. When two spherical armoured bubbles are fused, jamming of the particles on the interface supports the unequal stresses that are necessary to stabilize a non-spherical shape.

### An analytic expression for the ultimate intrinsic SNR in a uniform sphere [^114FNyC5]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

The ultimate intrinsic signal-to-noise ratio (UISNR) is normally calculated using electrodynamic simulations with a complete basis of modes. Here, we provide an exact solution for the UISNR at the center of a dielectric sphere and assess how accurately this solution approximates UISNR away from the center.

Methods

We performed a mode analysis to determine which modes contribute to central UISNR - ζ(r→0). We then derived an analytic expression to calculate ζ(r→0) and analyzed its dependence on main magnetic field strength, sample geometry, and electrical properties. We validated the proposed solution against an established method based on dyadic Green's function simulations.

Results

Only one divergence-free mode contributes to ζ(r→0). The UISNR given by the exact solution matched the full simulation results for various parameter settings, whereas calculation speed was approximately 1000 times faster. We showed that the analytic expression can approximate the UISNR with < 5% error at positions as much as 10–20% of the radius away from the center.

Conclusion

The proposed formula enables rapid and direct calculation of UISNR in the central region of a sphere. The resulting UISNR value may be used, for example, as an absolute reference to assess the performance of head coils with spherical phantoms.

### Experimental evidence of tetrahedral symmetry breaking in siOglass under pressure [^112rxj6j]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

The fraction of the large void structure in SiO 2 glass with varying pressure is calculated by defining the void radius larger than 3.6 Å as the > 3.6 Å void radius structure (Fig. 4a). It is interesting to note that the threshold value of 3.6 Å in our SiO 2 glass is consistent with the value used to identify the low-density and high-density structures in terms of the structural parameter g 5 in SiO 2 liquid in a simulation study, which implies the relevance of the void radius analysis in this study to the second shell structures of silicon. The fraction of the > 3.6 Å void radius structure decreases with increasing pressure, and it almost disappears above 3.3 GPa (Fig. 4a). We note that, at the same pressure condition as the disappearance of the > 3.6 Å void radius structure, the volume fraction of cavity in SiO 2 glass reaches that of the random loose packing condition of equal spheres (Fig. 4b). The random loose packing of equal spheres is considered to be 0.555 (ref.) and 0.536 (ref.), which corresponds to the fraction of cavity of 0.445 and 0.464, respectively. The volume fraction of the cavity in SiO 2 glass increases at lower pressures, and it reaches that of the random loose packing limit at ~2.5–3.5 GPa (Fig. 4b). The random loose packing limit is considered to be the lowest limit of mechanically stable random packing arrangement of equal spheres, although the packing condition looser than the random loose packing limit is possible if spheres are strongly bonded as covalent bonding. Therefore, the cavity volume higher than the random loose packing limit in SiO 2 glass below ~2.5–3.5 GPa (Fig. 4b) implies a mechanically unstable structure. In fact, we find that void space formed from silicon atoms (Si void space) anomalously shrinks more than the change of the bulk volume of SiO 2 glass below ~2.3–3.5 GPa (Fig. 4c), which may be related to the anomalous properties of SiO 2 glass at pressures below ~2–3 GPa (refs. –). On the other hand, above 3.5 GPa, Si void space changes equally to the bulk volume change of SiO 2 glass (Fig. 4c), and SiO 2 glass exhibits normal behavior as the elastic properties start to increase with increasing pressure –. These data indicate that anomalous properties of SiO 2 glass is related to the change in the distribution of silicon atoms under pressure.

### Interplay between spherical confinement and particle shape on the self-assembly of rounded cubes [^116vfweD]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Determining the position and orientation of the nanocubes

The locations and orientations of the individual NPs were determined from the 3D reconstructed tomograms (Supplementary Fig. 12). As a first step we apply a 3D Gaussian blur (with a radius of 1.6 pixels) to the reconstructed data to get rid of the noise. The number of particles N and their rough positionswere found by a 3D centroiding algorithm similar to the one used by Crocker and Grier. The pixels in the picture are then divided into regions R i each belonging to a single particle by use of a watershed algorithm. Region R i is a set of pixels R i = {{ I 1, x 1 },{ I 2, x 2 },… { I m, x m }} with intensity I n and position x n for which water flowing along the steepest ascent would flow to a single local intensity maximum associated with particle i. We do not take pixels with an intensity below a threshold of 0.05 (relative to a maximum intensity of 1) into account.

The center of mass, or actually center of intensity, is then measured for all pixels belonging to a single particle to determine the exact position of the particlewhere I tot is the sum of all intensities in R i. To obtain accurate coordinates this and all following steps are performed on the unfiltered data. To determine the orientation, we use the technique described in the literature. We describe the intensity distribution around the center of mass in terms of spherical harmonics. As we know the symmetries of our particles, we know that we only need to look at l = 4 and l = 6. We can then align the particle by maximizing the correlation between the spherical harmonics of the found particle and the same expansion in spherical harmonics of a reference particle by rotating the expansion using Wigner D matrices. In principle, the intensity can be used directly but we found that for the reconstructed tomography images the gradients are more reliable. The details of the algorithm will be discussed in a later publication.

### Fractal modes and multi-beam generation from hybrid microlaser resonators [^1125DFPc]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Fractal modes for three and four microsphere topologies

We observe fractal laser modes in the interstices of a microsphere array that are encompassed by three or more spheres. Owing to the reflectivity of polystyrene or silica spheres at grazing incidence, diffraction losses in the resonator of Fig. 1a are reduced in the vicinity of the sphere/water (gain medium) interface and fractal modes appear. Furthermore, the fractal modes associated with specific microsphere arrangements appear to be unique to that geometry. Both three and four sphere topologies have been examined and, for interstitial regions encompassed by three spheres, four distinct fractal laser modes have been observed. Two of these resemble the Sierpinski Triangle and one matches the prediction of Fresnel diffraction simulations. The ability afforded by microfabrication techniques to position microspheres precisely on a mirror surface allows for a desired fractal mode to be produced and to pattern the requisite sphere arrangement over substantial areas.

A light scattering system devised by Sweet et al. comprising reflecting spheres arranged in the form of a trigonal pyramid, yielded fractal patterns in the light intensity distribution emerging from any of the four optical ports ("basins"). In the present experiments, the top sphere of the ref.pyramid has been removed, and a symmetric resonator is realized in which microsphere ensembles in the form of quasi-triangles, rectangles, etc. are positioned between two mirrors (Fig. 1a). Figure 2 is a representative microscope image of a portion of an array of 200 μm diameter spheres within the resonator of Fig. 1a. Recorded in plan view (oriented toward the bottom mirror) with a 20 × microscope objective, this micrograph was acquired with a single pulse of the pump laser, and the spatial scale at lower right indicates a length of 25 μm. The interstice at upper right (where dashed white circles denote the perimeters of the three bordering spheres) shows a laser fractal mode, and a second, weaker mode is developing in the inter-sphere gap at lower right. The dominant feature of the stronger transverse laser mode comprises two superimposed triangles forming a "Star of David" pattern, lying at the junction of three larger triangles separated azimuthally by 120 o. Another unanticipated aspect of the experimental results reported here is that of coupled fractals, illustrated by the inset to Fig. 2 (lower left). In this case, two of the spheres have been separated intentionally and the extension of laser radiation beyond the 3-sphere interstice is evident.

### Mean-field theory of random close packings of axisymmetric particles [^114hgXn6]. Nature Communications (2013). Medium credibility.

Finding the optimal random packing of non-spherical particles is an open problem with great significance in a broad range of scientific and engineering fields. So far, this search has been performed only empirically on a case-by-case basis, in particular, for shapes like dimers, spherocylinders and ellipsoids of revolution. Here we present a mean-field formalism to estimate the packing density of axisymmetric non-spherical particles. We derive an analytic continuation from the sphere that provides a phase diagram predicting that, for the same coordination number, the density of monodisperse random packings follows the sequence of increasing packing fractions: spheres < oblate ellipsoids < prolate ellipsoids < dimers < spherocylinders. We find the maximal packing densities of 73.1% for spherocylinders and 70.7% for dimers, in good agreement with the largest densities found in simulations. Moreover, we find a packing density of 73.6% for lens-shaped particles, representing the densest random packing of the axisymmetric objects studied so far.

### Distributed spirals: a new class of three-dimensional k-space trajectories [^113S9j7a]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

This work presents a new class of three-dimensional spiral based-trajectories for sampling magnetic resonance data. The distributed spirals trajectory efficiently traverses a cylinder or sphere or intermediate shape in k-space. The trajectory is shown to be nearly as efficient as a conventional stack of spirals trajectory in terms of scan time and signal-to-noise ratio, while reducing coherent aliasing in all three spatial directions and reducing Gibbs ringing due to the nature of collecting data from a sphere in k-space. The trajectory uses a single two-dimensional spiral waveform with the addition of a single orthogonal waveform which is scaled with each repetition, making it relatively easy to implement. Blurring from off-resonance only occurs in two dimensions due to the temporal nature of the sampling.

### Minimum entropy production by microswimmers with internal dissipation [^117VUmjX]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Optimal shape of the active droplet

In the following, we numerically determine the optimal shape of a fluid-filled surface-driven swimmer of the type of a self-propelled droplet. For each axisymmetric shape, we numerically determine the drag coefficients of the passive droplet and the no-slip body using a custom-written boundary element method (based on Green's functions from BEMLIB) and use the theorem to calculate the minimum dissipation by the active droplet. We parameterize the shape as a chain of segments of equal length, linearly rescale it to impose a fixed volume, and then use a numerical optimization procedure to determine the shape with the minimum dissipation.

The resulting shapes obtained for different ratios of the internal to external viscosity (μ i / μ) are shown in Fig. 4 a. Figure 4 b shows the obtained minimum dissipation, relative to that of a spherical shape (13), along with a selection of optimal shapes. As anticipated, with a vanishing internal viscosity, μ i = 0, only external dissipation remains relevant and the optimal shape becomes that of an infinitely thin needle. In the case of equal viscosities, μ i = μ, the optimal shape is close to a prolate spheroid with an aspect ratio of 1.16. The dissipated power is 0.991 that of a spherical droplet, indicating that the advantage over a spherical shape is tiny. On the other hand, if the internal viscosity dominates, the optimal shapes first become oblate and eventually transition to a toroid. The discontinuous topological transition takes place at a viscosity ratio μ i / μ ≈ 4. The propulsion by a toroid rotating inside-out has been studied in the literature for a long time, but only recently a flagellate with a swimming mode using the same principle has been reported.

### Reduced rotational flows enable the translation of surface-rolling microrobots in confined spaces [^115pAB24]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

To unravel the nature of the additional forces acting on the microrollers under confinement, we performed three-dimensional (3D) CFD analyses. Since performing a dynamic simulation of the microrollers is computationally expensive, the fixed spheres having 2a = 10 µm diameter were rotated, translated, or both rotated and translated at different confinement ratios. To validate our finite element simulations, we computed hydrodynamic forces acting on the spheres for two particular cases: rotation and translation (Fig. 4b) at differentaccording to:where σ is the stress tensor, n is the outward-pointing normal vector, and S is the particle surface. In the rotating sphere, the total acting force resulted in + x direction with clockwise rotation of the body, and this force is essentially F P (Eq. 1). In the translating sphere, the total acting force resulted in -x direction with a translation in +x direction, and that force is essentially F D (Eq. 2). Our simulations have shown quantitative agreement with the results from Goldman et al. with channel dimensions of 40 a × 40 a × 40 a (Supplementary Fig. 9a, b). At these dimensions, the sphere was essentially in a semi-infinite fluid; thus, there was no confinement effect. We performed another set of CFD analyses for further validation, where we separately calculated the forces acting on the rotating and translating spheres at their theoretically matching Ω and V at = 0.005. To calculate the theoretical V for Ω, we used the following equation obtained by curve fitting ofwith respect to(R 2 = 0.9995, Supplementary Fig. 9c):

### Dysconnection and cognition in schizophrenia: a spectral dynamic causal modeling study [^115Fk8dh]. Human Brain Mapping (2023). Medium credibility.

2.5.3 Visualization of network dysconnection

Following PEB analysis, we constructed a binarymatrix for each network (containingsubnetworks), where 1's denoted the connections contributing to group difference effects. Then, the nodal degree for each subnetwork was computed as the sum of the corresponding row and column entries in this binary matrix. These degrees were normalized (i.e. divided) by the maximum degree in an n ‐node directed network (i.e. 2 n − 1). For visualization purposes, the normalized degrees were set as the radii of spheres centered on the peak coordinates of the subnetworks in MNI space. The results were illustrated using the BrainNet Viewer toolbox (Xia et al.). Hence, a larger sphere marks further dysconnection of a subnetwork within its pertinent network.

2.6 Cognitive relevance of effective connectivity in

After DCM analysis, we asked whether the EC profile of these seven large‐scale networks could explain the cognitive performance of the SZ patients. Therefore, we used canonical correlation analysis (CCA) (Hotelling,) to identify linear relationships between the strengths of EC parameters and the MCCB scores of the patients, after adjusting for age, gender and medication dosage (as CPZ equivalents). To decrease overfitting, we used an ensemble feature selection method (based on forward selection and backward elimination) to restrict the number of variables compared to the sample size. In the following, we outline the details of this procedure and the fundaments of the CCA model.

2.6.1 Canonical correlation analysis

CCA is a multivariate statistical method that identifies the sources of common variation in two (usually high‐dimensional) sets of variables, such that the identified patterns offer a compact description of many‐to‐many relations. Hence, CCA "opens interpretational opportunities that go beyond techniques that map one‐to‐one relations (e.g. Pearson's correlation) or many‐to‐one relationships (e.g. ordinary multiple regression)" (Wang et al.). Especially, in the era of big data neuroscience, CCA is being efficiently used to chart the links between brain, behavior, cognition, genes and disease (Calhoun & Sui; Correa et al; Mihalik et al; Mohammadi‐Nejad et al; Smith et al; Wang et al; Xia et al; Zhuang et al.).

### Pseudometrically constrained centroidal voronoi tessellations: generating uniform antipodally symmetric points on the unit sphere with a novel acceleration strategy and its applications to diffusion and three-dimensional radial MRI [^113iJ8yw]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

The purpose of this work is to investigate the hypothesis that uniform sampling measurements that are endowed with antipodal symmetry play an important role in image quality when the raw data and image data are related through the Fourier relationship. Currently, it is extremely challenging to generate large and uniform antipodally symmetric point sets suitable for three-dimensional radial MRI. A novel approach is proposed to solve this long-standing problem in a unique and optimal way.

Methods

The proposed method is based on constrained centroidal Voronoi tessellations of the upper hemisphere with a novel pseudometric.

Results

The time complexity of the proposed tessellations was shown to be effectively linear, i.e., on the order of the number of sampling measurements. For small sample size, the proposed method was comparable with the state-of-the-art method (a direct iterative minimization of the electrostatic potential energy of a collection of electrons antipodal-symmetrically distributed on the unit sphere) in terms of the sampling uniformity. For large sample size, in which the state-of-the-art method is infeasible, the reconstructed images from the proposed method has less streak and ringing artifacts, when compared with those of the commonly used methods.

Conclusion

This work proposed a unique and optimal approach to solving a long-standing problem in generating uniform sampling points for three-dimensional radial MRI.

### Cellular exchange imaging (CEXI): evaluation of a diffusion model including water exchange in cells using numerical phantoms of permeable spheres [^114pP3xo]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Biophysical models of diffusion MRI have been developed to characterize microstructure in various tissues, but existing models are not suitable for tissue composed of permeable spherical cells. In this study we introduce Cellular Exchange Imaging (CEXI), a model tailored for permeable spherical cells, and compares its performance to a related Ball & Sphere (BS) model that neglects permeability.

Methods

We generated DW-MRI signals using Monte-Carlo simulations with a PGSE sequence in numerical substrates made of spherical cells and their extracellular space for a range of membrane permeability. From these signals, the properties of the substrates were inferred using both BS and CEXI models.

Results

CEXI outperformed the impermeable model by providing more stable estimates cell size and intracellular volume fraction that were diffusion time-independent. Notably, CEXI accurately estimated the exchange time for low to moderate permeability levels previously reported in other studies (κ < 25 μm/s). However, in highly permeable substrates (κ ≥ 50 μm/s), the estimated parameters were less stable, particularly the diffusion coefficients.

Conclusion

This study highlights the importance of modeling the exchange time to accurately quantify microstructure properties in permeable cellular substrates. Future studies should evaluate CEXI in clinical applications such as lymph nodes, investigate exchange time as a potential biomarker of tumor severity, and develop more appropriate tissue models that account for anisotropic diffusion and highly permeable membranes.

### Larmor frequency shift from magnetized cylinders with arbitrary orientation distribution [^114LPWhu]. NMR in Biomedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

In general, the size of the mesoscopic sphere necessary to achieve a given accuracy depends on the structural universality class of the medium and its correlation length, as demonstrated in Figure 8, showing the scaling of the mean squared difference between the model estimate and ground truth. The observed power law decay can be explained from the decay of the structural correlation functionfrom inclusions residing outside the mesoscopic sphere (as derived in Appendix C). Hereis the microstructural dimension whiledenotes the structural exponent.

In Simulation (b), we computed the MRI Larmor frequencyin a sample with a slowly varying magnetic microstructure. This was done using our full model (Equation 21), and compared with a ground truth calculation (Equation 56). Figure 9 shows that the SD of the ratio between the two field estimates decreases when the voxel width compared with the size of the cylinders increases, and confirms that using the full model (Equation 21) on these particular samples can estimate the ground truth MRI Larmor frequency with high accuracy. For example, assuming a radius around 0.5 μm, voxels should ideally be larger than around 20 μm, which is well below standard clinical resolution, if SD should be below 5%. However, as shown in Simulation (a), the deviation would decrease further for higher volume fractions. In addition, neglecting the mesoscopic contribution and using the elementary dipole field instead of the voxel‐averaged one when computing the macroscopic contribution resulted in substantial deviations from ground truth. This underscores that we cannot replace the mesoscopic Lorentz sphere with an empty void, as for the molecular Lorentz cavity. By doing so, we neglect an important contribution to the MRI Larmor frequency.

In Simulation (c), we tested the accuracy of the mesoscopic dipole tensorfor a population of infinitely long cylinders, Equation (43), compared with explicitly calculatingusing Equation (18). Our model agreed with our analytical solution, Equation (43), and previous results for parallel cylinders. The degree of orientation dispersion was varied to make the effect of structural anisotropy clear.

### A geometrically based method for automated radiosurgery planning [^112CwaT5]. International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology, Physics (2000). Low credibility.

Purpose

A geometrically based method of multiple isocenter linear accelerator radiosurgery treatment planning optimization was developed, based on a target's solid shape.

Methods and Materials

Our method uses an edge detection process to determine the optimal sphere packing arrangement with which to cover the planning target. The sphere packing arrangement is converted into a radiosurgery treatment plan by substituting the isocenter locations and collimator sizes for the spheres.

Results

This method is demonstrated on a set of 5 irregularly shaped phantom targets, as well as a set of 10 clinical example cases ranging from simple to very complex in planning difficulty. Using a prototype implementation of the method and standard dosimetric radiosurgery treatment planning tools, feasible treatment plans were developed for each target. The treatment plans generated for the phantom targets showed excellent dose conformity and acceptable dose homogeneity within the target volume. The algorithm was able to generate a radiosurgery plan conforming to the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) guidelines on radiosurgery for every clinical and phantom target examined.

Conclusions

This automated planning method can serve as a valuable tool to assist treatment planners in rapidly and consistently designing conformal multiple isocenter radiosurgery treatment plans.

### Mathematic analysis of incremental packing density with detachable coils: does that last coil matter much? [^114yujqp]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2012). Low credibility.

Higher packing attenuation of coils in cerebral aneurysms is associated with a decreased recurrence rate. However, geometric relationships suggest that an additional coil may have very little effect on packing attenuation as aneurysm size increases. We mathematically evaluated the relationship between aneurysm size and incremental packing attenuation for coils currently available.

### Microdosimetry of a 25 keV electron microbeam [^115jbCHK]. Radiation Research (2001). Low credibility.

Electron microbeam experiments are planned or under way to explore in part the question regarding whether the bystander effect is a general phenomenon or is restricted to high-LET radiation. Since low-LET radiations scatter more readily compared to high-LET radiations, identifying bystander cells and assessing the potential dose that they may receive will be crucial to the interpretation of radiobiological results. This paper reports on initial calculations of the basic information needed for a stochastic model of the penetration of energetic electrons in tissue-like matter; the model will be used to predict doses delivered to adjacent regions in which bystander cells may reside. Results are presented of calculations of the stochastics of energy deposition by 25 keV electrons slowing down in a homogeneous water medium. Energy deposition distributions were scored for 1-micrometer spheres located at various penetration and radial distances up to 10 micrometer from the point of origin. The energy of 25 keV was selected because experiments are planned for that energy. At 25 keV there is a high probability that the entire electron track will be contained within a typical mammalian cell. Individual tracks are scored because of their primacy; data for higher doses can be obtained by convoluting single-track distributions. The event frequency decreases approximately exponentially after the first micrometer to 1% at about 8 micrometer of penetration. Radially, the 1% contour extends to 3.5 micrometer at a penetration of 5.5 micrometer. The frequency-mean energy deposited decreases from 1.5 to 1 keV/micrometer at a penetration of 3.5 micrometer, then increases back to about 1.5 at a penetration of 6.5 micrometer. The mean energy increases to about 3 keV/micrometer at a radial distance of 8.5 micrometer.

### Prediction of absolute crystal-nucleation rate in hard-sphere colloids [^113ThkdW]. Nature (2001). Excellent credibility.

Crystal nucleation is a much-studied phenomenon, yet the rate at which it occurs remains difficult to predict. Small crystal nuclei form spontaneously in supersaturated solutions, but unless their size exceeds a critical value — the so-called critical nucleus — they will re-dissolve rather than grow. It is this rate-limiting step that has proved difficult to probe experimentally. The crystal nucleation rate depends on Pcrit, the (very small) probability that a critical nucleus forms spontaneously, and on a kinetic factor (kappa) that measures the rate at which critical nuclei subsequently grow. Given the absence of a priori knowledge of either quantity, classical nucleation theory is commonly used to analyse crystal nucleation experiments, with the unconstrained parameters adjusted to fit the observations. This approach yields no 'first principles' prediction of absolute nucleation rates. Here we approach the problem from a different angle, simulating the nucleation process in a suspension of hard colloidal spheres, to obtain quantitative numerical predictions of the crystal nucleation rate. We find large discrepancies between the computed nucleation rates and those deduced from experiments: the best experimental estimates of Pcrit seem to be too large by several orders of magnitude.

### Three-dimensional flat landau levels in an inhomogeneous acoustic crystal [^111wLRnH]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Acoustic lattice design

Next, we design an acoustic diamond lattice to realize the above phenomenon. Figure 3 a shows the acoustic unit cell, which consists of two sphere cavities connected by cylindrical tubes with radii r 1 or r 0. The whole structure is filled with air and covered by hard walls. Here, the two-sphere cavities act as two sublattices (denoted as "A" and "B"; see Fig. 3 c), and the cylindrical tubes control the coupling strengths. We define a dimensionless parameter ξ = r 1 / r 0 which describes the anisotropic strength of couplings. Like the tight-binding model, this acoustic lattice hosts a circular-like nodal ring in its band structure. We numerically find that the square of the radius of the nodal ring is controlled by a single parameter ξ and scales linearly with ξ (Fig. 3 b). Moreover, for different values of ξ, the frequency of the nodal ring remains almost unchanged (the inset to Fig. 3 b). We can straightforwardly engineer PMFs in this acoustic lattice with these nice properties. The supercell of the designed structure is schematically illustrated in Fig. 3 c, where ξ gradually varies along the x 3 direction. This variation makes the radius of the nodal ring linearly dependent on space coordinates, similar to the case in the tight-binding model. We cut part of the top and bottom cavities to tune on-site potential. After precisely controlling h t and h b, the drumhead surface state is almost flat (Fig. 3 e), which is an advantage in the drumhead state measurement.

### Radiofrequency thermal ablation: computer analysis of the size of the thermal injury created by overlapping ablations [^113WmGHU]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to perform a computer analysis of the size of the thermal injury created by overlapping multiple thermal ablation spheres.

Materials and Methods

A computer-assisted design system was used to create three-dimensional models of a spherical tumor, a spherical tissue volume consisting of the tumor plus a 1-cm tumor-free margin, and individual spherical ablations. These volumes were superimposed in real-time three-dimensional space in different geometric relationships. The effect of the size and geometric configuration of the ablation spheres was analyzed with regard to the ability to ablate the required volume of tissue (tumor plus margin) without leaving untreated areas or interstices.

Results

The single-ablation model showed that if a 360-degree 1-cm tumor-free margin is included around the tumor targeted for ablation, radiofrequency ablation devices producing 3-, 4-, and 5-cm ablation spheres can be used to treat 1-, 2-, and 3-cm tumors, respectively. The six-sphere model, in which six ablation spheres are placed in orthogonal planes around the tumor, showed that the largest tumor that may be treated with a 3-cm ablation device is 1.75 cm, whereas 4- and 5-cm ablation spheres can be used to treat tumors measuring 3 and 4.25 cm, respectively. The 14- sphere model showed that addition of eight more spheres to the six-sphere model increased the treatable tumor size to 3, 4.6, or 6.3 cm, depending on the diameter of the ablation sphere used. For treating larger tumors, we found a cylindrical model to be less efficient but easier to control.

Conclusion

Our computer analysis showed that the size of the composite thermal injury created by overlapping multiple thermal ablation spheres is surprisingly small relative to the number of ablations performed. These results emphasize the need for a methodic tumor ablation strategy.

### Uncovering a widely applicable empirical formula for field emission characteristics of metallic nanotips in nanogaps [^115T1Pzd]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Interestingly, the investigation of electron tunneling process between the planar substrate and the non-planar tips (spherical or hyperboloidal geometry) decades ago has already concluded that electron field emission current density in a nanogap is significantly regulated by the two factors including the asymmetry in the geometries of cathode and anode, and the overall image charge potential of space charge with both electrodes. Those effects on the overall image charge potential have been carefully examined in refs. for sphere-plane electrode configuration with nanogaps using the rigorous electrodynamic models under spherical and prolate spheroidal coordinates. It was found that the non-planar geometry of cathode could directly result in the anisotropic distribution of image charge potential spatially surrounding the cathode. Most importantly, the overall image charge potential of sphere-plane system in nanogap was predicted to be less negative near the cathode, compared to that of plane-plane configuration, indicating an increasing of electron transmission barrier height in the former case due to the anticipated geometric asymmetry in electrode pair. Furthermore, the increasing of geometric asymmetry further diminishes the lowering of electron emission barrier height, because the complete multiple-image potential goes to less negative, relative to that of plane-plane geometry. For example, using the exact image charge potential model given in ref.for hyperboloidal tip model (tungsten electrode with R = 10 nm and d = 1, 2, and 3 nm, respectively), for R / d = 10, 5.0, and 3.3, the absolute values are reduced by 1.0%, 1.9%, and 2.9%, compared to those of plane-plane system, respectively. The raising of electron transmission energy barrier height with the increasing of the geometric asymmetry in nanogap for anode-cathode system can reduce the emission current density in comparison with that of plane-plane configuration under the same electrostatic field. This may be the main reason for the presence of the correction factor V MG = C MG V m < V m between experimental field emission curves and the MG FE equation, as shown in Fig. 4a. These insight inspires further theoretical exploration to refine predictions for nanoscale field emission phenomena, where the three-dimensional image charge potential between space charges and the bulk charges in the both electrodes (anode and cathode) should be especially considered.

### Panoramic visual statistics shape retina-wide organization of receptive fields [^114EsVjv]. Nature Neuroscience (2023). High credibility.

Using parametrization, we computed various RF characteristics. We found two sets of pixels corresponding to the center and the surround. Center pixels are the pixels within two standard deviations from the center of the G 1. Surround pixels are the pixels within two standard deviations from the center of the G 2 and that are not center pixels. The center size is the number of pixels in the center set, converted to mm 2 for display. The relative surround strength is the ratio of the absolute value of sum of surround pixels to the absolute value of sum of center pixels. Vertical surround asymmetry is defined aswhere u and l denote the absolute value of sum of pixels in the upper and lower halves of the surround pixels, respectively. The distance between the center and the surround is the distance between the center of mass (COM) of the center pixels and the COM of the surround pixels. The orientation is the angle between the horizontal axis and the line connecting the two COMs. Radial profiles were computed as the average values of the pixels in RF 2D within rings of increasing radii centered on the point P var. The average value of the center or surround pixels across time was taken to be the RF center or surround temporal dynamics, respectively. The R 2 goodness of fit was computed aswhere M = G 1 + G 2 is the RF parametrization. The values of the above RF parameters are reported for a few representative neurons in Extended Data Fig. 4.

Hydrated radii of solutes for permeation tests

The hydrated radii of some molecules that can be found in previous reports, including K +, Cl −, Na +, Mg 2+, Fe(CN) 6 3−, and sucrose were used. For other molecules, we introduced the Connolly accessible area (CAA) for further calculation, which was described by the locus of the center of the solvent molecule (which is considered as a sphere) as it rolls over the van der Waals surface of probe molecules. CAA was calculated using Chem 3D Ultra Software (8.0.3 version, Cambridge-Soft, MA, USA). Energy minimization with MM2 method was performed to generate the structure of well-studied molecules, including glycerol, dextrose, Fe(CN) 6 3−, sucrose, lactose, raffinose and Ru(II). The equivalent spherical radius (CAA radius) of molecule was derived from CAA and then plotted as a function of hydrated radius, which is shown in Supplementary Fig. 9. The favorable linear relationship indicates acceptable calculation results, upon which the hydrated radii of other molecules are obtained and shown in Supplementary Table 4. For the enantiomers used for permeation tests over GCN-CSA membranes, the hydrated radii are also calculated and listed in Supplementary Table 4.

### 2D material programming for 3D shaping [^111M1Xx7]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Cone singularities

The Riemann theorem suggests that our method can form any curved shapes of thin sheets by conformally morphing 2D hydrogels. However, in practice, the accessible Ω r limits accessible 3D configurations. To mitigate this limitation, we introduced the concept of cone singularities (Fig. 3). The idea is to first map a 3D shape on a cone surface (K = 0) and then unfold the cone surface to the 2D plane (without further area distortion) by cutting the surface through cone points, rather than directly mapping a shape to the plane (as shown in Fig. 2). This approach can significantly reduce Ω r, as a 3D shape can be conformally mapped to a cone surface with lower area distortion than to the plane and the cone surface can be isometrically flattened to the plane.

### Three-dimensional flat landau levels in an inhomogeneous acoustic crystal [^114jQwh8]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Experiment

To observe the LLs experimentally, we fabricate two 12-layer samples with stronger PMFs under B = 0.27 a −2, B = 0.18 a −2, and one sample with B = 0 for comparison, as shown in Fig. 4 a–c. Figure 4 a shows the top layer of the sample, and Fig. 4 c shows the experiment setup. The stepping motor controls the mechanical arm, allowing precise field mapping. The strong PMF leads to LLs with wide-space spacing to be measured in a simple pump-and-probe experiment (see the "Methods" subsection "Experimental measurements"). Figure 4 d plots the measured spectrum when the source and the probe are placed at two bulk sites (Supplementary Information Fig. S8). As can be seen, there are pronounced peaks at the corresponding frequencies of the predicted LLs.

### Direct observation of liquid nucleus growth in homogeneous melting of colloidal crystals [^116onvSf]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

Intermediate superheating 0.025≲Δ φ ≲0.05

At intermediate superheating, the nucleus growth behaviour is qualitatively similar to that at weak superheating, but equation 3 (solid curve in Fig. 3c) underestimates the measured growth rate because (i) f may depend on Δ φ, (ii) the long-time D L (Δ φ) in bulk liquid may not accurately reflect D ′(Δ φ) at the solid-liquid interface and (iii) multimers rather than monomers may attach to the nucleus. These effects can be accommodated in equation 3 by adding a prefactor κ (Δ φ) = 1+0.2Δ φ +400Δ φ 2 from the fitting (the dashed curve in Fig. 3c).

Effects of surface tension and nucleus shape

The measured v follows equation 3 only after the early stage of nucleation. At the early stage of nucleation, however, we found that v is strongly affected by the surface tension and the nucleus shape. Small nuclei have large surface-to-volume ratios, hence their surface tension effect is non-negligible. Surface tension should suppress nucleus growth, which is confirmed by the smaller slope at small r in Fig. 3a, b. Using r ✱ = 2 γ /(ρ |Δ μ |) and φ = ρπσ 3 /6, we account for this effect by addingto the exponent of equation 3 to ensure the nucleus growth rate is zero at the critical size r *, that is, with equal chance of growing and shrinking.

Next, we incorporate the influence of a non-spherical nucleus shape into equation 3. For a non-spherical nucleus, we can introduce a shape factorso that both the nucleus volumeand the surface areain equation 1 can be accurately expressed. ξ = 1 for a sphere and < 1 for a non-sphere.

### How heat propagates in liquidHe [^113X1iE8]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

At very low temperature, the response to temperature gradient is dominated by quasi-particles (Fig. 4 b). These are plane waves within a thermal window of the Fermi level which can carry heat. κ / T decreases quadratically with temperature, due to the temperature dependence of ℓ q p.

To identify the collective transport mode leading to the T 1/2 temperature dependence dominant above 0.5 K, let us compare it with two other cases. In crystals, the cubic temperature dependence of phonons at low temperature reflects the temperature dependence of the volume of the Debye sphere when the mean-free-path is saturated to a constant value. In glasses, the asymptotic low-temperature dependence of thermal conductivity is close to quadratic. The slower temperature dependence κ is due to an increase in the mean-free path with cooling. In both cases, the presence of long wavelength carriers leads to a superlinear exponent (between 2 and 3) in the temperature dependence. Our case requires a scenario circumventing the cubic temperature dependence of a Debye sphere.

A collective transmission by the whole Fermi surface will meet this requirement. This would be a sound mode with a wave-vector fixed at twice the Fermi radius (Fig. 4 c). There are two reasons for distinguishing 2 k F as a wave vector. The first is theoretical. The Lindhard function, which quantifies the susceptibility of a fermionic gas to an external perturbation has a singularity at q = 2 k F. The second is experimental. Inelastic X-ray scattering experiments, find that the dispersion of zero sound has a pronounced anomaly near q = 2 k F (see Supplementary Note 5).

The Landauer transmission rate of such a heat-carrying mode depends on its evanescence. The wave is attenuated by the thermal fuzziness of the Fermi surface in the momentum space, which is set by the inverse of the de Broglie thermal length. We can consider the latter,(m * is the effective mass), as a mean free path. The number of involved states is identical to the one used to quantify the quasi-particle contribution. Replacingin Eq. (1) then gives:

### Sphere of arbitrarily polarized exceptional points with a single planar metasurface [^111k1uG6]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Topological properties of arbitrary EP

We previously showed that an EP-induced reflection zero enables us to accumulate a topological phase covering the fullrange by encircling the EP within a rationally chosen two-dimensional parameter space. In the following, we demonstrate that relying on the topological phase accumulated while encircling an EP exhibiting arbitrarily polarized eigenstate (linearly, circularly, and elliptically polarized cases correspond to the first, second, and third column in Fig. 2, respectively), we can manipulate the phase of light on a single polarization channel for any arbitrary polarization with a single metasurface by varying incidence conditions. To observe the EP complex-square-root dependency of the eigenvalue surfaces, we plot the real and imaginary parts of the eigenvalues in the two-dimensional parameter space of, corresponding to the rotation angles of the two metallic nanorods. These two parameters are expected to control the co- and cross-polarization ratio. By sweeping them in the vicinity of the parameters corresponding to the EP with linearly polarized eigenstates, the real and imaginary parts of the eigenvalues of the reflection matrix present two intersecting Riemann surfaces, which coalesce at the EP (See Supplementary Figs. S4 and S5). Furthermore, at the intersecting point, the reflection coefficient ofcomponent is zero (singularity), as shown in Fig. 3a, consistent with the EP nature of this coalescence point. As we previously pointed out, we obtain a phase winding around the EP singularity that realizes a fullphase coverage, of interest for the design of polarization-converting metasurfaces. It should be noted that due to its topological nature, the accumulated phase always coversregardless of the trajectory followed in parameter space, as long as the loop encircles the conversion zero in reflection. EP-induced topological phase can thus be employed for hologram construction by choosing four unit-cell designs sufficiently far away enough from the zero point to have higher efficiency, corresponding to four different rotation angles around the singularity center (indicated by the black triangles in Fig. 3a). EPs with circularly polarized coalesced eigenstates are also realized, as presented in the second column of Fig. 3, where we obtain similar degeneracy of eigenvalues and an equivalent topological phase pattern (Fig. 3b). For completeness, the last column shows an example of EP with elliptically polarized coalesced eigenstates, characterized by. The topological phase still shows the 2winding, as shown in Fig. 3c. It is worth mentioning that, for a fixed geometry, other arbitrarily polarized topological phases can also be realized under different incident conditions. In contrast, the other anti-diagonal channel of the reflection matrix reveals no topological phase, as illustrated in Fig. 3d–f, corresponding to the EPs showing linear, circular, and elliptical polarization, respectively. Overall, this demonstrates that the topological phase accompanying an EP in a two-dimensional parameter space can be designed to act on any arbitrary polarization state and, thus, allows to modulate the wavefront of any polarization. With the detailed four structures around each EP summarized in Fig. 3g (black triangles in Fig. 3a–f), a 2phase variation can be covered and used for wavefront manipulation. The corresponding amplitudes are shown in Fig. 3h. Building on this design versatility and exploiting the 2phase acquired by beams of adequate polarization when encircling EPs with coalesced eigenstate of the same polarization, we can fabricate a single metasurface simultaneously displaying EPs for three different polarizations (linear, circular, and elliptical). In the following section, we illustrate this by spectrally and spatially monitoring the occurrence of zeros in one anti-diagonal Jones matrix component, while the other components are nonzero. In the last section, we combine the full capabilities of our approach to produce one and the same meta-holograms generated thanks to the 2ET phase for three different polarizations (illustration shown in Fig. 3i).

### Designing highly efficient interlocking interactions in anisotropic active particles [^116dk8m9]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

In contrast to synthetic active particles, biological microswimmers often have non-spherical shapes – and simulations have predicted that their collective behavior is strongly influenced by shape. For example, longitudinally-propelled rods self-organize into polar bands instead of clusters as a consequence of the lateral association promoted by their elongated shape –. Clusters of anisotropic active particles may not only display Brownian diffusion, but also directed and spinning motion. In addition, the critical density at which cluster form has been proposed to depend on shape because it strongly influences inter-particle slowing down. For active hexagons, for example, efficient deceleration upon collision results in nucleation of many small clusters at far lower particle densities than would be expected for spheres.

Despite these predictions, there is little experimental work due to the limited availability of active particles with an anisotropic shape. Experiments with transversely-propelled rods revealed that stable doublets already form at particle densities of ≈ 1%and clustering is favored with increasing aspect ratio of the rods. Tori, both horizontally and vertically oriented, were observed to form dynamic unstable clustersand standing disks were found to cluster at about 10%. While more complex shapes have been prepared, it is often challenging to selectively generate sufficient quantities to test their phase behavior and typically not possible to gradually tune their shape to find optimal clustering conditions.

Here, we use 3D micro-fabrication to create active particles with a shape that is continuously tunable between a sphere and a rod, i.e. bent rods, and study their collective behavior at low particle densities. We find that clustering occurs at extremely low surface area fractions (below 0.022%) due to a highly efficient nucleation process that relies on interlocking between the particles. Complementing our experiments with simulations and an analytical model, we find that the self-organization at low particle densities can be captured by a Michaelis-Menten kinetics and thus can be characterized by a single scaling parameter that depends on the particle density and shape only. We demonstrate that the efficiency of the self-organization process is strongly influenced by the concave shape, which affects the interplay between interlocking and stability, and show that the combination of directed motion and steric interactions leads to motility induced clustering. Our insights provide a generic understanding of how phase separation occurs in a whole class of anisotropic particles from spheres to rods as well as a strategy to precisely control the stability of active particles through the shape of their interaction site, thus enabling the rational design of their assembly pathways into functional active materials.

### Thermal variation in gradient response: measurement and modeling [^115MhTkd]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

3.3 Model self‐consistency and conditioning

Figure 4 shows the conditioning, self‐consistency, and prediction error of the thermal model as a function of temperature radius. With training as used in this study, the model is seen to be ill‐conditioned for radii smaller thanC. In this case, few of the temperature states visited during training lie within the temperature radius so that the matrixcontains critically few columns, underdetermining the model. The conditioning settles beyondC, indicating robust over‐determination. Even in the over‐determined regime, the condition number per se is still large. This is to be expected because temperature is naturally correlated between sensor positions, resulting in large first singular values of the training matrix. Under‐determination at low temperature radii is also reflected by exceeding self‐consistency (low) and large prediction error.settles at 1.5–2.0 per mil for all gradient axes and the prediction errors settle at only somewhat larger values. Stable self‐consistency and prediction even at the largest radii indicate validity of the global linear model.

Stable criteria also at the largest temperature radii indicate validity of the global linear model

### Shape-dependent ordering of gold nanocrystals into large-scale superlattices [^116M21QL]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Monte Carlo simulation

Nanocrystals were represented as hard polyhedra in an isochoric ensemble with periodic boundary conditions. Overlaps were detected via the Gilbert-Johnson-Keerthi distance algorithm in code used and tested in prior work. Hard boundaries were implemented by preventing any vertex of the polyhedron from exiting the z -facing sides of the bounding box. Homogeneous nucleation simulations of N = 2,048 polyhedra for Fig. 3a were equilibrate for 50 million Monte Carlo cycles. Heterogeneous simulations of N = 4,096 polyhedra in Fig. 3e were equilibrated for 3 million Monte Carlo cycles. Each Monte Carlo cycle consisted of N randomly selected translation or rotation moves.

Solid-liquid order parameter

Standard solid–liquid order parameters analysed the crystallized fraction of the system during each run. We first defined the bond orientational order parameteras a measurement of the local particle environment, where N b (i) is the number of neighbouring particles within a cutoff distance r cut from particle i. For rhombic dodecahedra, octahedra, and spheres r cut was chosen near the first minimum of the radial distribution function, for cubes analysis required using the first two coordination shells. The correlation between local environments of particles pairs is the scalar product. The number of sufficiently correlated local environments ξ (i) is the number of neighbours whose scalar product exceeds a threshold value d c. We defined solid-like particles as those with ξ exceeding a cutoff ξ c. Neighbouring solid-like particles were then clustered to identify nuclei. To calculate the number of ordered layers in wall simulations, the number of solid particles was normalized by the approximate number of particles in each layer, or N 2/3. This estimate is exact for the simple cubic crystal, and within 10% for the other shapes. As for the order-parameter coloured figures (Fig. 3a), the solid-like particles were coloured yellow, and the liquid particles were coloured from a blue colour map ranging from darkest to lightest using the locally invariant spherical harmonic function(ref.). All parameters are given in Supplementary Table 2.

### Colloidal crystals with diamond symmetry at optical lengthscales [^111DrE9m]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Future optical materials promise to do for photonics what semiconductors did for electronics, but the challenge has long been in creating the structure they require-a regular, three-dimensional array of transparent microspheres arranged like the atoms in a diamond crystal. Here we demonstrate a simple approach for spontaneously growing double-diamond (or B32) crystals that contain a suitable diamond structure, using DNA to direct the self-assembly process. While diamond symmetry crystals have been grown from much smaller nanoparticles, none of those previous methods suffice for the larger particles needed for photonic applications, whose size must be comparable to the wavelength of visible light. Intriguingly, the crystals we observe do not readily form in previously validated simulations; nor have they been predicted theoretically. This finding suggests that other unexpected microstructures may be accessible using this approach and bodes well for future efforts to inexpensively mass-produce metamaterials for an array of photonic applications.

### Defect and structural evolution under high-energy ion irradiation informs battery materials design for extreme environments [^112Qipxr]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Fig. 6
Atomic configurations of P2-Na 2/3 Fe 1/2 Mn 1/2 O 2 and antisite defect positions.

a Before structural relaxation. All Na cations are placed at 2 d sites initially. The blue arrows indicate the moving directions of some Na cations after relaxation. b After structural relaxation. The Na cations with an asterisk (*) are those moving to the new 2b sites. The labeled TM and Na cations are those used to create antisite pairs. The two figures show some additional atoms at simulation box boundaries for visualization purpose (based on periodic boundary conditions). Large yellow spheres: Na; medium brown spheres: Fe; medium purple spheres: Mn; small red spheres: O.

Due to the complex atomic configuration of P2-Na 2/3 Fe 1/2 Mn 1/2 O 2, it is expected that the antisite pair formation energy depends on the local atomic environment of each antisite defect. To ensure that our conclusion is not specific to a certain antisite defect configuration, three Fe–Na antisite pairs (Fe 1 –Na 1, Fe 2 –Na 2, Fe 3 –Na 2) and three Mn–Na antisite pairs (Mn 1 –Na 1, Mn 2 –Na 1, Mn 3 –Na 2) are modeled and the original positions of these cations are shown in Fig. 6b. The calculated antisite pair formation energies are shown in Table 1. Similar to O3 or P2-NaFeO 2, the formation energy of an Fe–Na antisite pair is still high: in the range of 2.73–3.22 eV; the formation energy of a Mn–Na antisite pair is even higher: in the range of 4.04–5.05 eV. The exact cause for the discrepancy between the two types of antisite pairs is unclear. It could be due to different charge states of Fe and Mn cations in P2-Na 2/3 Fe 1/2 Mn 1/2 O 2, or different local atomic environment of these defects, or the actual ionic radii of Fe and Mn are slightly different from the theoretical predictions by Shannon. Nevertheless, the formation energy of an antisite pair in P2-Na 2/3 Fe 1/2 Mn 1/2 O 2 is significantly higher than in O3-LiNiO 2, regardless of the antisite defect type (Table 1). Therefore, our DFT results of antisite pair formation energy as well as the ionic radius difference can be well applied to explain why O3-LiNiO 2 has a better radiation tolerance than P2-Na 2/3 Fe 1/2 Mn 1/2 O 2. The DFT results from the P2-Na 2/3 Fe 1/2 Mn 1/2 O 2 are qualitatively similar as that from the ideal NaFeO 2 (although the magnitudes are different), indicating the ionic radius difference between TM and alkali cations is a key factor for predicting the antisite formation energy and radiation tolerance. This justifies NaFeO 2 can be used as a model system for Na 2/3 Fe 1/2 Mn 1/2 O 2 in terms of radiation tolerance.

### Mathematical description of q-space in spherical coordinates: exact q-ball imaging [^111z2wwp]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Novel methodologies have been recently developed to characterize the microgeometry of neural tissues and porous structures via diffusion MRI data. In line with these previous works, this article provides a detailed mathematical description of q-space in spherical coordinates that helps to highlight the differences and similarities between various related q-space methodologies proposed to date such as q-ball imaging (QBI), diffusion spectrum imaging (DSI), and diffusion orientation transform imaging (DOT). This formulation provides a direct relationship between the orientation distribution function (ODF) and the diffusion data without using any approximation. Under this relationship, the exact ODF can be computed by means of the Radon transform of the radial projection (in q-space) of the diffusion MRI signal. This new methodology, termed exact q-ball imaging (EQBI), was put into practice using an analytical ODF estimation in terms of spherical harmonics that allows obtaining model-free and model-based reconstructions. This work provides a new framework for combining information coming from diffusion data recorded on multiple spherical shells in q-space (hybrid diffusion imaging encoding scheme), which is capable of mapping ODF to a high accuracy. This represents a step toward a more efficient development of diffusion MRI experiments for obtaining better ODF estimates.

### Magic number colloidal clusters as minimum free energy structures [^111QBTbb]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Free energy calculation

Absolute free energy of a colloidal cluster at packing fraction ϕ was calculated with the Einstein crystal methodapplied to hard spheres in hard spherical confinement implemented in a Monte Carlo simulation using harmonic springs, V (r) = λ (r − r 0) 2. Spring anchor points { r 0 } were chosen after minimizing the appearance of near-contacts between spheres via rapid compression of the colloidal cluster to high density and re-expansion to ϕ. The spring constant λ was increased logarithmically in discrete steps over the range 10 −5 to 10 5. Particle swap movessped up diffusion processes. At each step for λ the averaging was performed long enough for relaxation. The calculation for Fig. 5h was repeated five times and averaged to decrease numerical error. Spheres were assigned to a shell s in a cluster of S shells by distance to the center via s = [(R − r)(S − 0.5)/ R]. The average shell thickness in the packing fractions simulated with EDMD was 0.95 σ. Absolute free energy values were reported after subtracting the bulk contribution F 0 (N, ϕ). Starting points for the free energy calculation are equilibrated simulation snapshots and constructed ideal FCC, Mackay, and anti-Mackay cluster. We are aware that the constructed clusters are not equilibrated. For this reason, the free energies are only upper limits in the case of the constructed clusters.

Results

Geometry of neural representation in CA1

The idea that hyperbolic geometry potentially underlies the neural representation of space follows from the construction illustrated in Fig. 1b. Each point in the two-dimensional (2D) plane represents an abstract neural response property, and a disk represents the collection of all the properties for one neuron in CA1. The more two disks overlap, the more similar the response properties of the corresponding two neurons are and, thus, the higher their response correlation. We now assign neurons that have larger disks in the plane to higher positions within the hierarchy (quantified by the z coordinate in the three-dimensional (3D) space) compared to neurons with smaller disks. The x, y coordinates are taken directly as the center positions of their disks. A link from a higher-to-lower-tier neuron is made if the larger disk contains (at least partially) the smaller disk. The resulting construction generates an approximate tree-like structure. The tree-like structure can, in turn, be viewed as a discrete mesh over the underlying hyperbolic geometry. The leaves of the tree correspond to peripheral points, whereas roots of the tree correspond to positions closer to the origin of the hyperbolic geometry (Fig. 1a). We note that, in general, the plane can be of any dimension and is drawn here as 2D mainly for illustrative purposes. In the simplified case of each neuron having only one place field, the plane can be interpreted as physical space and the disks as being the place fields of the neurons. In this setting, the distribution of one-dimensional (1D) place field sizes should follow approximately an exponential distribution:where p (s) is the probability density of place field sizes, and s max is the maximal place field size. The exponent in this distribution is the curvature ζ of the representation (or, equivalently, the size of the hyperbolic geometry with unit curvature). In Fig. 1c, d, we indeed find that an exponential distribution fits the distribution of place field sizes well (P = 0.851, χ 2 goodness-of-fit (GOF) test). A caveat with this analysis, however, is that, strictly speaking, it applies to the case where each neuron has one place field, whereas multiple place fields are observed per neuron in moderately large environments.

### Distinct neural mechanisms for heading retrieval and context recognition in the hippocampus during spatial reorientation [^112Gt76U]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

During disorientation, when navigators lose their bearings, the internal sense of direction becomes unreliable. Lost navigators must then rely on external cues to identify their surroundings and re-establish their sense of direction. This process, known as spatial reorientation, has been extensively studied in the fields of animal behavior and developmental psychology (for review, see ref.). However, despite some exceptions, the neural mechanisms underlying reorientation are largely unknown. The primary objective of the present study is to address this gap in knowledge, with a specific focus on elucidating how various types of external cues are utilized in spatial reorientation and how they may contribute to different stages of this process.

Previous behavioral research on reorientation across various species has consistently revealed a critical role of environmental geometry, the shape of a layout defined by the relative positioning of walls and boundaries. The significance of geometry in reorientation becomes evident through the challenge faced by disoriented navigators in distinguishing between geometrically identical locations within symmetrical environments, such as the opposite corners of a rectangular chamber. This difficulty persists even when non-geometric features are present to disambiguate them –. Non-geometric features include cues such as odors, sounds, landmarks, or other sensory information that navigators use for orientation that do not rely on geometric relationships or spatial configurations of objects.

### Local structure in deeply supercooled liquids exhibits growing lengthscales and dynamical correlations [^116S9Gy1]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

We now consider the interpretation of our findings in the context of some theoretical approaches. The concurrent growth of the structural and dynamic lengthscales at deeper supercooling points towards the increasing role played by structural correlations in the dynamic slowdown, supporting theoretical approaches which imagine a phase transition related to thermodynamics. This is also supported by the measurement of the increasing overlap between local regions of the supercooled liquid. However we emphasise that the relatively small lengthscales we obtain mean that our results should be regarded as consistent with some theoretical interpretations rather than anything conclusive. Concerning the connection to theories related to local structure, our data are compatible with geometric frustration, where a frustrated transition to a state of icosahedra is predicted to be suppressed to deep supercooling. We have now accessed such deeper supercooling and find heightened icosahedral ordering. The link between icosahedral ordering and high overlap consolidates the influence of geometric frustration with approaches which emphasise low configurational entropy. Our work thus provides support for thermodynamic (i.e. structural) theories of the glass transition over approaches which prioritise kinetic aspects.

More generally the use of STED microscopy presents several advantages over confocal microscopy for the study of colloidal systems. While the positions of sub-micron systems can be studied using other microscopy methods when confined to a 2D layeror at lower densities, the key advantage of this approach is that it yields full 3D coordinates at very high densities. This technique provides an enhancement in spatial resolution beyond conventional confocal microscopy, enabling the use of smaller (but otherwise chemically identical) particles. Similar sized particles have previously been studied at comparable densities, but crucially those measurements were performed using techniques that do not yield particle positions. Therefore this approach is compatible with the different methods previously applied to the study of dense colloidal hard spheres, but accesses new state points or new information that could not be obtained previously. One difficulty of measurements of this type is that exceptional mechanical and thermal stability is necessary: mechanical drift of the sample of just a few microns (very common during a conventional confocal microscope measurement but negligible compared to the size of the image) can result in the region of interest leaving the imaged volume, prematurely ending the measurement, while thermal fluctuations can result in the laser excitation and depletion spots misaligning, reducing the effectiveness of the STED mechanism. Nevertheless, this new technique holds great promise in the field of colloid and interface science, allowing for systems to be studied in real space that were previously only accessible using scattering or spectroscopic methods.
