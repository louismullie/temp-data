## Question

Should antibiotics for necrotic tissue be continued after amputation?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether antibiotics should be continued after amputation for necrotic tissue infection, and if so, for how long and under what circumstances. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and whether the amputation achieved source control. Then, I should verify what major guidelines say about duration when all infected tissue has been removed versus when residual infected bone remains. Next, I will examine evidence for shorter courses and the role of bone margin cultures. After that, I need to consider special scenarios like prosthetic joint infection and necrotizing soft tissue infection. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stewardship-minded recommendation and double-check for any exceptions that would change management.

> Let me first confirm the clinical premise: amputation for necrotic tissue is a form of source control, but the need for ongoing antibiotics hinges on whether all infected and necrotic tissue has been adequately excised and whether residual infection persists in bone or soft tissue, so I need to check the operative note and pathology or culture results before deciding on duration [^111Fcscx].

> I will now examine the highest-quality guidance for diabetic foot osteomyelitis, since many necrotic foot infections involve bone. The IWGDF/IDSA 2023 guideline recommends up to 3 weeks of antibiotics after a minor amputation with positive bone margin culture, and about 6 weeks when no bone resection or amputation is performed, with the caveat that durations are conditional and evidence quality is low, so I should be cautious and tailor to clinical response and culture data [^111Fcscx] [^116eW8pN] [^1124DqQF].

> Wait, let me verify the implication for resected infections. If the infected bone has been completely resected or amputated and there is no residual infected bone, the infection can be treated as a soft tissue infection with a shorter course, typically 1–2 weeks, which aligns with the general DFI soft tissue recommendation and the principle that source control permits shorter antimicrobial therapy [^112k9Q94].

> Hold on, I should verify whether shorter durations have supportive data. A pilot randomized trial suggested that 3 weeks after surgical resection may be comparable to 6 weeks for DFO, and observational work has not shown a clear duration threshold for preventing recurrence, which supports the notion that appropriately selected patients can do well with shorter courses after adequate surgery, though I need to ensure the margins are clean and the patient is improving clinically before stopping [^111Fcscx] [^112yxxBK].

> Next, I should review special scenarios. For prosthetic joint infection where amputation leaves residual infected bone or hardware, IDSA recommends completing 4–6 weeks of pathogen-specific therapy, whereas if all infected bone and soft tissue are removed, 24–48 additional hours may suffice, so I need to check the operative field and imaging to distinguish these situations before finalizing duration [^114vTHkP] [^116ofVUe].

> Let me consider necrotizing soft tissue infection separately. Guidelines advise continuing antibiotics until further debridement is no longer necessary, the patient is clinically improved, and fever has resolved for 48–72 hours, and some contemporary reviews suggest that very short post–source control courses, even around 48 hours, may be adequate in selected cases, but I should confirm clinical stability and that serial debridements are complete before stopping [^114qcXkC] [^112FyTjX].

> I should double-check perioperative prophylaxis because it can be confused with treatment. Extended postoperative antibiotic prophylaxis after lower limb amputation reduces surgical site infection compared with 24-hour prophylaxis, but this is prophylaxis, not treatment, and should not be conflated with therapeutic duration for established infection, so I need to separate these indications in the care plan [^115YrqSS] [^112ZKtRn].

> But wait, what if the wound is open and will heal by secondary intention? I need to ensure that antibiotics are continued while there is ongoing infection and then stop when infection resolves, recognizing that wound healing may take longer and does not by itself dictate antibiotic duration, and I should reassess at about 4 weeks if infection appears not to be resolving to look for retained sequestra, inadequate debridement, or vascular insufficiency [^112k9Q94].

> Let me synthesize a practical approach: if the amputation achieved complete excision of infected and necrotic bone with negative or unavailable bone margin cultures, treat as soft tissue infection for 1–2 weeks. If bone margin cultures are positive, treat for up to 3 weeks. If no bone resection was done or residual infected bone remains, treat for about 6 weeks. If prosthetic material or residual infected bone is present after amputation, extend to 4–6 weeks pathogen-specific therapy. And if this was NSTI, continue until clinical improvement and no further debridement is needed, often 48–72 hours after the last debridement, adjusting to patient response and laboratory trends [^111Fcscx] [^112k9Q94] [^114vTHkP] [^114qcXkC].

> I need to ensure I am not overlooking fundamentals that modify duration. Obtain deep tissue or bone cultures when possible to enable de-escalation, reassess perfusion and consider revascularization if ischemia is limiting healing, and avoid unnecessary antibiotics for uninfected ulcers or colonized wounds, as overtreatment increases harm without benefit and violates stewardship principles [^112VzzR1] [^111mDxnS] [^113CkSYW].

> In summary, antibiotics are generally continued after amputation for necrotic tissue infection when residual infection remains, with duration tailored to whether infected bone was completely resected and to culture results, whereas they can be stopped within 24–48 hours if all infected tissue and bone have been removed and there is no sepsis. I should confirm source control at the bedside and with operative and pathology reports before making the final call [^114RiLKR] [^116ofVUe].

Antibiotics are **not routinely continued** after amputation of necrotic tissue if all infected or necrotic material has been removed and there is no residual infection or systemic illness [^116ofVUe]. Antibiotics should be stopped within 24–48 hours post-amputation when surgical margins are clear, there is no residual infection, and the patient is clinically stable [^116ofVUe]. Continue antibiotics only if there is residual infection, positive bone margins, or systemic instability, with duration tailored to clinical response and culture results [^114vTHkP] [^111Fcscx]. Prolonged antibiotics without ongoing infection are unnecessary and increase adverse effects and resistance risk [^112FyTjX] [^113UTJvi].

---

## Indications for continuing antibiotics after amputation

Antibiotics are indicated after amputation **only when any of the following conditions are present**:

- **Residual infection**: Persistent infection at the surgical site or adjacent tissues [^1172D4C9].

- **Positive bone margins**: Histological or microbiological evidence of infection at the amputation margins [^1124DqQF].

- **Systemic instability**: Ongoing sepsis, bacteremia, or systemic inflammatory response [^116ofVUe].

- **Prosthetic joint infection**: Residual infected bone or soft tissue remaining after amputation [^114vTHkP].

---

## Recommended duration of antibiotic therapy

The duration of antibiotic therapy after amputation **varies** based on the presence of residual infection and the clinical scenario:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended duration of antibiotics** |
|-|-|
| No residual infection, clear margins, stable patient | Stop antibiotics within 24–48 hours post-amputation [^116ofVUe] |
| Residual soft tissue infection | 1–2 weeks (adjust based on clinical response) [^112k9Q94] |
| Positive bone margins (osteomyelitis) | Up to 3 weeks after minor amputation [^111Fcscx] |
| Prosthetic joint infection with residual infection | 4–6 weeks of pathogen-specific therapy [^114vTHkP] |
| Systemic instability (sepsis, bacteremia) | Continue until clinical stability and clearance of bacteremia |

---

## Risks associated with unnecessary antibiotic continuation

Continuing antibiotics unnecessarily after amputation **poses several risks**, including:

- **Antibiotic resistance**: Increased risk of multidrug-resistant organisms [^113UTJvi].

- **Adverse effects**: Higher incidence of drug-related complications, including nephrotoxicity, hepatotoxicity, and gastrointestinal disturbances [^notfound].

- **Increased healthcare costs**: Unnecessary prolonged hospitalization and medication expenses [^notfound].

- **Delayed wound healing**: Potential interference with normal wound healing processes [^notfound].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Current clinical guidelines and expert consensus statements emphasize the following principles:

- **Stop antibiotics promptly**: Discontinue antibiotics within 24–48 hours post-amputation if there is no residual infection, clear surgical margins, and the patient is clinically stable [^116ofVUe].

- **Tailor therapy**: Adjust antibiotic duration based on clinical response, culture results, and the presence of residual infection [^111Fcscx].

- **Avoid unnecessary antibiotics**: Prolonged antibiotic therapy without ongoing infection is discouraged due to potential harms and lack of benefit [^11569Y16].

---

## Clinical outcomes associated with different antibiotic durations

Recent studies and clinical experience indicate that **shorter antibiotic courses** (24–48 hours) after amputation with clear margins and no residual infection result in outcomes comparable to longer courses, with no significant difference in infection recurrence or wound healing rates. Conversely, **prolonged antibiotic therapy** without ongoing infection does not improve outcomes and increases the risk of adverse effects and antibiotic resistance [^116ofVUe].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Antibiotics should not be continued after amputation of necrotic tissue unless there is residual infection, positive bone margins, or systemic instability. When indicated, tailor the duration to clinical response and culture results; **unnecessary prolongation** increases adverse effects and resistance without improving outcomes.

### The effects of early antibiotic administration on bacterial culture growth from hand abscesses [^116Puy88]. Hand (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Traditional management of hand abscesses consists of withholding antibiotics prior to drainage to optimize bacterial culture growth and outcome. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of preoperative empiric antibiotics on the rate of culture growth and rate of adverse events in patients with acute hand abscesses.

Methods

We performed a retrospective review of prospectively collected data on 88 consecutive hand abscesses that received empiric antibiotics prior to incision and drainage from 2012 to 2013 at an urban academic institution. We analyzed patient demographics, bacteriology, culture growth results, time to surgery, and frequency of adverse events.

Results

The overall rate of positive culture growth was 90% (n = 79) despite running the antibiotics for a mean of 31 hours prior to debridement. Furthermore, 96% of the isolates were given a susceptible antibiotic during that time. The mean number of debridements was 1.5 per patient, but 4 re-operations were necessary for wound complications. No patients required an amputation or were upgraded to intensive care.

Conclusions

Preoperative empiric antibiotic administration does not appear to greatly reduce bacterial culture growth from hand abscesses. The adverse events are relatively few for simple abscesses treated with pre-surgical antibiotics and decompression within 24 hours.

### The diabetic foot [^112vtt7x]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

Lower extremity complications are common in patients with diabetes and include neuropathy, ulceration, infection, and peripheral arterial disease. Foot infections represent the single most common cause of hospitalization and lower extremity amputation in persons with diabetes. Foot ulceration as a result of diabetic peripheral sensory neuropathy, rigid osseous deformities and soft-tissue contractures, repetitive trauma from unprotected ambulation, and peripheral vascular disease can all lead to a limb- or life-threatening infection. Antibiotic therapy for diabetic soft-tissue and osseous infections is usually inadequate as an isolated form of therapy. The mainstay of treatment involves well-planned surgical procedures, including extensive and properly placed incisions to perform adequate drainage of abscesses and débridement of necrotic soft-tissue and osseous structures from which deep cultures are obtained for specific antibiotic coverage. Initial antibiotic therapy should provide broad-spectrum coverage, and when final culture results are available the regimen should be revised to organism-specific coverage. Detailed and timely evaluation of the vascularity of the limb is paramount, followed by timely vascular reconstruction involving various endovascular and open surgical procedures to restore pulsatile flow to the full extent of the limb.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis for the prevention of infection after major limb amputation [^112ZKtRn]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Major limb amputation is often required by patients with a limited capacity to tolerate post-operative complications. Amputation stump infection is common and may necessitate re-amputation, potentially exposing a vulnerable patient to further serious complications. Effective antibiotic strategies should be employed to reduce wound infection after major amputation.

Methods

Online databases were searched to identify studies regarding reduction in wound infection following major limb amputation. Only four randomised studies were identified comparing antibiotic prophylaxis with control; a further three evaluated the efficacy of specific antibiotics. Study design, end-points and outcome data were recorded. The data were too heterogeneous for formal meta-analysis.

Results

Prophylactic antibiotics significantly reduced rates of stump infection in all studies, and were associated with a reduced rate of re-amputation in one. Where investigated, the type of antibiotic did not affect rates of infection. In non-randomised studies, infection with methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) increased the risk of complications and post-operative death.

Conclusion

It is agreed that prophylactic antibiotics are part of the standard of care for amputation surgery, and this is supported by limited, mostly historical-controlled data. Evolution of the bacterial threat means that future studies should assess the role and type of prophylaxis for patients with existing bacterial colonisation or infection.

Necrotizing fasciitis, including Fournier gangrene — evaluation and treatment — should prioritize urgent surgery and broad empiric antibiotics: prompt surgical consultation is recommended for patients with aggressive infections associated with signs of systemic toxicity or suspicion of necrotizing fasciitis or gas gangrene (strong, low); empiric antibiotic treatment should be broad (eg, vancomycin or linezolid plus piperacillin-tazobactam or plus a carbapenem, or plus ceftriaxone and metronidazole) because the etiology can be polymicrobial or monomicrobial (group A Streptococcus, community-acquired MRSA) (strong, low); and penicillin plus clindamycin is recommended for documented group A streptococcal necrotizing fasciitis (strong, low). Necrotizing SSTIs differ from the milder, superficial infections and these deep infections involve the fascial and/or muscle compartments and are potentially devastating due to major tissue destruction and death.

### Predictors of mortality and limb loss in necrotizing soft tissue infections… [^113LZn6H]. JAMA Network (2005). Excellent credibility.

Interventions Standard current treatment including early and scheduled repeated debridement, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and physiologic and nutritional support was given to all patients. Main Outcome Measures Limb loss and mortality. Results. Conclusions Clostridial infection is consistently associated with poor outcome. This together with the independent predictors mentioned earlier should aid in identifying patients on hospital admission who may benefit from more aggressive and novel therapeutic approaches., or whether surgical management is required. 19, 21, 24–26 However, none of these classifications have been universally adopted and none allow a relatively simple means to classify patients on their initial examination, rendering their clinical utility rather limited.

Furthermore, treatment strategies generally involve the same principles for all NSTI, making these classification schemes less relevant. Patients with NSTI were treated using a standardized approach that included early and scheduled repeated debridements in concert with aggressive physiologic and nutritional support in the intensive care unit. Empirical broad-spectrum antibiotics were given to all patients, with narrowing of the spectrum once the predominant organisms were identified. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy was not routinely used. Treatment variables included information on the timing of surgery and the number of procedures during the hospital stay. Antibiotic treatment strategies were also recorded including use of 1 or multiple antibiotics and the specific antibiotics used.

Lastly, data on the use of additional therapeutic strategies, such as intravenous immunoglobulin and hyperbaric oxygen, were recorded. Information on antimicrobial therapy was available for 155 patients. Of these, 136 patients received combination antimicrobial regimens, most commonly penicillin, clindamycin, and gentamicin. There was no significant association between antimicrobial choices and adverse outcomes. A very small proportion of patients received either intravenous immunoglobulin or hyperbaric oxygen, precluding any assessment of their relationship to outcome. They compared patients with necrotizing fasciitis according to the adequacy of surgical therapy and divided patients into 2 groups. Those who underwent delayed or inadequate preliminary therapy had a mortality rate of 38. 0% vs
4. 2% in those who underwent early and aggressive therapy.

### Appropriate surgical management in skin and soft tissue infections [^116A5Lib]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To present standards and recent technical innovations in the surgical management of skin and soft tissue infections (SSTI).

Recent Findings

SSTI are a frequent cause of presentation in the acute care setting. They can range from simple and uncomplicated to severe and necrotizing infections. Surgical management plays an important role in the treatment of uncomplicated SSTI. Recent evidence indicates that a subgroup of patients (e.g. immunocompromised patients) profits from a postoperative course of antibiotic treatment of 5–7days. In diabetic foot infections (DFI), repeated debridement to remove necrotic tissue and control infection can prevent minor and major amputation. In necrotizing soft tissue infections (NSTI), early and aggressive surgical debridement is paramount. Recent advancements have explored skin-sparing techniques in selective cases.

Summary

The management of SSTIs requires a combination of surgical and antimicrobial strategies tailored to the type and severity of the infection. Further clinical research is necessary in order to define more accurately those collectives in severe SSTI who profit from a less aggressive surgical approach.

Soft-tissue DFI postoperative antibiotic duration — After post-surgical debridement of moderate or severe soft-tissue DFIs, a pilot prospective study found a 10-day duration sufficient, and the guideline makes a conditional recommendation for a 10-day duration of antibiotic therapy following surgical debridement with low certainty of evidence based on only one high-risk-of-bias study; the 2019 guidance had advised a duration of 1–2 weeks for any soft-tissue DFIs. It also notes clinicians frequently monitor serum CRP during DFI therapy, but this practice is supported by low-quality evidence based on only one study.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

Chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI) — infection and surgical wound care considerations note that foot infection, particularly among patients with diabetes, can progress rapidly, and prompt diagnosis and initiation of therapy, including antibiotics and other surgical management, are key to reducing the probability of both amputation and death; patients with CLTI should be promptly evaluated and treated to prevent infections with resistant microorganisms and amputation, and surgical debridement is recommended for foot infections involving abscess, gas, or necrotizing fasciitis. After successful revascularization, most patients with foot gangrene are evaluated for minor amputation with staged or delayed primary closure or surgical reconstruction when feasible. Negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) can be used to achieve wound healing after revascularization and minor amputation when primary or delayed secondary closure is not feasible; studies of NPWT have focused primarily on patients with diabetes with very limited data without diabetes, and for uncomplicated osteomyelitis one can consider treating primarily with antibiotics.

### Diabetic foot disorders. A clinical practice guideline (2006 revision) [^111bnZfc]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2007). Medium credibility.

Osteomyelitis in diabetic foot — diagnosis and management emphasize confirmatory testing, surgical debridement when indicated, and cautious use of local antibiotics. A diagnosis of osteomyelitis requires that both culture and biopsy studies reveal positive findings; resection of infected bone with or without local amputation and concurrent antimicrobial therapy is the most optimal management, though the routine need for surgery has recently been questioned and in some cases medical therapy alone might be warranted. If the affected bone has been completely resected or amputated, the infection may be treated as a soft tissue infection; however, if residual bone is present, the patient will likely require 4 to 8 weeks of antibiotic therapy. Antibiotic impregnated bone cement has been advocated but should only be used if the bone has been thoroughly debrided and the soft tissue envelope is adequate for wound closure, and it is generally recommended that antibiotic beads be removed 2 weeks after placement; gentamycin, tobramycin, or vancomycin are typically used in the beads. An alternative is absorbable bone graft substitutes mixed with antibiotic powder, but studies are lacking as to the efficacy of either modality compared with systemic antimicrobial therapy alone, and if the infection fails to respond to therapy, the patient should be fully reassessed.

### Necrotizing soft-tissue infections: an orthopaedic emergency [^117RG1QC]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2019). Medium credibility.

Necrotizing soft-tissue infections are caused by a variety of bacterial pathogens that may affect patients at any age or health status. This orthopaedic emergency initially presents with nonspecific signs such as erythema and edema. As the disease progresses, classic signs such as bullae, cutaneous anesthesia, ecchymosis, tense edema, and gas can be seen. A high level of suspicion is needed to properly identify and treat in a timely manner. Pain out of proportion to presentation and rapid progression even with appropriate antibiotic treatment should heighten suspicion of a necrotizing soft-tissue infection. The mainstay of management is extensive débridement and decompression of all necrotic tissue and broad-spectrum antibiotics. Débridements are repeated to ensure that disease progression has been halted. Early surgical débridements should take precedent over transfer because of the high rate of limb loss and mortality as a result of surgical delay.

### Clinical guidance for type II necrotizing fasciitis | Group A strep… [^1128zue5]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Necrotizing fasciitis is a rapidly progressive infection that destroys deep soft tissues.
- Diagnosing necrotizing fasciitis can be difficult due to non-specific early symptoms.
- Primary treatment is early and aggressive surgical exploration and debridement of necrotic tissue.
- Serious complications are common and necrotizing fasciitis has a high mortality rate.
- Follow recommended guidelines when caring for patients with necrotizing fasciitis. Medications Corticosteroid therapy has been shown to be a predisposing factor. In the past, retrospective reports linked nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs to necrotizing fasciitis. Prospective studies have not confirmed this linkage. Trauma or surgery While rare, when necrotizing fasciitis occurs it frequently happens after trauma or surgery. The trauma can be:

- Minor or unapparent trauma
- Non-penetrating trauma like bruises and muscle strain
- Penetrating trauma that breaks the skin.

Clinical features Necrotizing fasciitis can affect any part of the body, but most commonly affects extremities, particularly the legs. Treatment Primary treatment of necrotizing fasciitis is
- Early and aggressive surgical exploration
- Debridement of necrotic tissue Surgery is coupled with appropriate broad-spectrum parenteral antibiotic therapy. Surgery and debridement Upon first exploration, extensive incisions that go beyond the area of apparent involvement are usually necessary. The wound should be left open and re-inspected 24 hours later to ensure adequacy of the initial debridement. Antibiotics Antibiotic therapy is based upon Gram stain findings. Once group A strep is confirmed to be the etiology, recommended treatment is high-dose penicillin and clindamycin. Other treatment options Intravenous immunoglobulin may be considered in cases of severe necrotizing fasciitis, although efficacy has not been proven.

Complications Amputations are a common complication of necrotizing fasciitis. As the disease progresses, patients may quickly progress to sepsis, shock, organ failure, and death. Mortality rates In the most recent 5 years, the mortality rate of streptococcal necrotizing fasciitis has been around 15 to 20%. It increases with age of the person affected and the presence of streptococcal toxic shock syndrome.

### Remission in diabetic foot infections: duration of antibiotic therapy and other possible associated factors [^112yxxBK]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Aim

To determine the most appropriate duration of antibiotic therapy for diabetic foot infections (DFIs).

Methods

Using a clinical pathway for adult patients with DFIs (retrospective cohort analysis), we created a cluster-controlled Cox regression model to assess factors related to remission of infection, emphasizing antibiotic-related variables. We excluded total amputations as a result of DFI and DFI episodes with a follow-up time of < 2 months.

Results

Among 1018 DFI episodes in 482 patients, we identified 392 episodes of osteomyelitis, 626 soft tissue infections, 246 large abscesses, 322 episodes of cellulitis and 335 episodes of necrosis; 313 cases involved revascularization. Patients underwent surgical debridement for 824 episodes (81%), of which 596 (59%) required amputation. The median total duration of antibiotic therapy was 20 days. After a median follow-up of 3 years, 251 of the episodes (24.7%) were followed by ≥ 1 additional episode(s). Comparing patients with and without additional episodes, risk of recurrence was lower in those who underwent amputation, had type 1 diabetes, or underwent revascularization. On multivariate analysis including the entire study population, risk of remission was inversely associated with type 1 diabetes (hazard ratio [HR] 0.3, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.2–0.6). Neither duration of antibiotic therapy nor parenteral treatment affected risk of recurrence (HR 1.0, 95% CI 0.99–1.01 for both). Similarly, neither > 3 weeks versus < 3 weeks of therapy, nor > 1 week versus < 1 week of intravenous treatment affected recurrence. In stratified analyses for both soft tissue DFIs or osteomyelitis separately, we did not observe associations of antibiotic duration with microbiological or clinical recurrences of DFI. The HRs were 1.0 (95% CI 0.6–1.8) for an antibiotic duration > 3 weeks overall and 0.6 (95% CI 0.2–1.3) for osteomyelitis cases only. Plotting of duration of antibiotic therapy failed to identify any optimal threshold for preventing recurrences.

Conclusions

Our analysis found no threshold for the optimal duration or route of administration of antibiotic therapy to prevent recurrences of DFI. These limited data might support possibly shorter treatment duration for patients with DFI.

### AAOS clinical practice guideline summary: prevention of surgical site infection after major extremity trauma [^113mx31v]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2023). High credibility.

Soft tissue management — benefits and harms in major extremity trauma are described as favorable for appropriate management. The benefits of appropriate management of the soft tissue injury associated with major extremity trauma far outweigh the potential harms. Soft tissue integrity is essential for appropriate extremity function and protection of the underlying structures. Favorable outcomes of soft tissue injury associated with major extremity trauma allows for significant secondary benefits including decreased initial hospital length of stay and fewer operative interventions. Treatment failure invariably results in additional procedures, rehospitalization, and prolonged antibiotics, delaying rehabilitation and frequently eliminating affected individuals from the workforce, and late amputation after failed limb-salvage is often a very real consideration.

### Necrotizing soft tissue infections: a review [^113GSnmq]. JAMA Surgery (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Necrotizing soft tissue infections (NSTIs) are severe life- and limb-threatening infections with high rates of morbidity and mortality. Unfortunately, there has been minimal improvement in outcomes over time.

Observations

NSTIs are characterized by their heterogeneity in microbiology, risk factors, and anatomical involvement. They often present with nonspecific symptoms, leading to a high rate of delayed diagnosis. Laboratory values and imaging help increase suspicion for NSTI, though ultimately, the diagnosis is clinical. Surgical exploration is warranted when there is high suspicion for NSTI, even if the diagnosis is uncertain. Thus, it is acceptable to have a certain rate of negative exploration. Immediate empirical broad-spectrum antibiotics, further tailored based on tissue culture results, are essential and should be continued at least until surgical debridement is complete and the patient shows signs of clinical improvement. Additional research is needed to determine optimal antibiotic duration. Early surgical debridement is crucial for improved outcomes and should be performed as soon as possible, ideally within 6 hours of presentation. Subsequent debridements should be performed every 12 to 24 hours until the patient is showing signs of clinical improvement and there is no additional necrotic tissue within the wound. There are insufficient data to support the routine use of adjunct treatments such as hyperbaric oxygen therapy and intravenous immunoglobulin. However, clinicians should be aware of multiple ongoing efforts to develop more robust diagnostic and treatment strategies.

Conclusions and Relevance

Given the poor outcomes associated with NSTIs, a review of clinically relevant evidence and guidelines is warranted. This review discusses diagnostic and treatment approaches to NSTI while highlighting future directions and promising developments in NSTI management.

### Diabetic foot infections: current treatment and delaying the 'post-antibiotic era' [^113UTJvi]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Treatment for diabetic foot infections requires properly diagnosing infection, obtaining an appropriate specimen for culture, assessing for any needed surgical procedures and selecting an empiric antibiotic regimen. Therapy will often need to be modified based on results of culture and sensitivity testing. Because of excessive and inappropriate use of antibiotics for treating diabetic foot infections, resistance to the usually employed bacteria has been increasing to alarming levels.

Review

This article reviews recommendations from evidence-based guidelines, informed by results of systematic reviews, on treating diabetic foot infections. Data from the pre-antibiotic era reported rates of mortality of about 9% and of high-level leg amputations of about 70%. Outcomes have greatly improved with appropriate antibiotic therapy. While there are now many oral and parenteral antibiotic agents that have demonstrated efficacy in treating diabetic foot infections, the rate of infection with multidrug-resistant pathogens is growing. This problem requires a multi-focal approach, including providing education to both clinicians and patients, developing robust antimicrobial stewardship programmes and using new diagnostic and therapeutic technologies. Recently, new methods have been developed to find novel antibiotic agents and to resurrect old treatments, like bacteriophages, for treating these difficult infections.

Conclusion

Medical and political leaders have recognized the serious global threat posed by the growing problem of antibiotic resistance. By a multipronged approach that includes exerting administrative pressure on clinicians to do the right thing, investing in new technologies and encouraging the profitable development of new antimicrobials, we may be able to stave off the coming 'post-antibiotic era'.

### Acute hand infections [^111dcXeG]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

The continued emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and the development of only a few new classes of antibiotics over the past 50 years have made the treatment of acute hand infections problematic. Prompt diagnosis and treatment are important, because hand stiffness, contractures, and even amputation can result from missed diagnoses or delayed treatment. The most common site of hand infections is subcutaneous tissue and the most common mechanism is trauma. An immunocompromised state, intravenous drug abuse, diabetes mellitus, and steroid use all predispose to infections.

### IWGDF / IDSA guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of diabetes-related foot infections (IWGDF / IDSA 2023) [^111Fcscx]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2024). High credibility.

Diabetes-related osteomyelitis of the foot (DFO) antibiotic duration — Recommendation 16 states: Consider a duration of up to 3 weeks of antibiotic therapy after minor amputation for diabetes-related osteomyelitis of the foot and positive bone margin culture and 6 weeks for diabetes-related foot osteomyelitis without bone resection or amputation (Conditional; Low). The rationale adds that we suggest administrating antibiotic agents at their upper recommended dosage range and usually for a total duration substantially longer than for soft-tissue infection, and that long-term suppressive antibiotic therapy is generally warranted only for individuals with retained orthopaedic hardware or extensive necrotic bone not amenable to complete debridement. Supporting data note two randomized controlled studies suggesting total duration for non-surgically treated DFO need not be as long as previously proposed, that duration after surgical debridement is likely shorter than for non-surgical treatment, and that in a pilot trial patients receiving either a 3- or 6-week course had similar outcomes and antibiotic-related adverse events.

### Diabetic foot disorders. A clinical practice guideline (2006 revision) [^115tmpmg]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2007). Medium credibility.

Diabetic foot amputation — surgical goals and emergent versus elective approach are specified: Healing with primary intention is prioritized, and in most instances it is advisable to perform an amputation at the most distal level that would allow for primary healing. Creation of a distal stump that will not cause muscle or other dynamic imbalances is emphasized. Although it is usually preferable to perform the amputation in an elective, controlled environment, when infection, necrotizing fasciitis, or gas gangrene are present, an open amputation may need to be done on an emergent basis. When performed under elective and stable conditions, the amputation should be fashioned so that it is curative, meaning the primary incision site can be closed primarily and that no further surgery is anticipated. When performed under emergent conditions, the procedure should usually be done proximal to the level of all necrotic tissue, with additional procedures anticipated to attain a closed wound and a stump that can accommodate shoes, custom inserts, or a prosthesis.

### Diabetic foot disorders. A clinical practice guideline (2006 revision) [^1177MDdr]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2007). Medium credibility.

Diabetic foot ulcer — debridement and wound bed preparation emphasize that debridement of necrotic tissue is an integral component in the treatment of chronic wounds since they will not heal in the presence of unviable tissue, debris, or critical colonization; debridement serves various functions including removal of necrotic tissue and callus, reduction of pressure, wound bed and tracking/tunneling evaluation, and reduction of bacterial burden, and it facilitates drainage and stimulates healing; debridement may be contraindicated in arterial ulcers, and except in avascular cases, adequate debridement must always precede topical agents, dressings, or closure procedures; among debridement methods, only surgical debridement has been proven to be efficacious in clinical trials and is the cornerstone of management, with thorough sharp debridement using a scalpel, tissue nippers, curettes, and curved scissors; excision should extend until healthy, bleeding soft tissue and bone are encountered and any surrounding callus must also be removed, with the main purpose to turn a chronic ulcer into an acute, healing wound; a deep abscess requires hospital admission and immediate incision and drainage, and joint resection or partial amputation is necessary if osteomyelitis, joint infection, or gangrene are present; regular removal of necrotic tissue can expedite healing and increase the probability of full secondary closure, whereas less frequent surgical debridement can reduce healing and increase infection risk; surgical debridement is repeated as often as needed if new necrotic tissue forms, and frequent "maintenance debridement" is commonly required; some clinicians distinguish surgical debridement as operating-room care versus clinic-based sharp debridement; hydrosurgery (Versajet®, Smith & Nephew, Inc, London, UK) is noted as a novel system indicated for surgical debridement of damaged and necrotic tissue in traumatic, ulcerated, and chronic wounds, surgical incisions, and burns.

Use of antibiotics in pediatric acute pancreatitis — adult evidence informing practice: Prophylactic antibiotics are not recommended for use in adult acute pancreatitis, and current adult recommendations are to use antibiotics only for infected necrosis or in hospitalized patients with necrotizing pancreatitis who are not improving clinically without antibiotic use. Infected necrosis should be suspected if the clinical status is worsening with fevers or when gas is present within the collection on imaging. For necrotizing pancreatitis, antibiotics known to penetrate necrotic tissue are recommended, such as carbapenems, quinolones, and metronidazole, and in this setting antibiotic use has been demonstrated to delay surgical interventions and decrease morbidity and mortality.

### Persistent Yersinia pestis antigens in ischemic tissues of a patient with septicemic plague [^116JhVxh]. Human Pathology (2005). Low credibility.

In November 2002, a couple from New Mexico traveled to New York where both had fever and unilateral inguinal adenopathy. The husband was in septic shock when he sought medical care and was admitted to an intensive care unit, where he developed ischemic necrosis of his feet which later required bilateral amputation. Yersinia pestis was grown from his blood. Immunohistochemical assays using anti-Y pestis antibodies demonstrated multiple bacteria and granular antigens in and around vessels of the ischemic amputation tissues obtained 20 days after initiation of antibiotics; however, no evidence of Y pestis was present in viable tissues. Immunohistochemical evidence of Y pestis inside vessels of gangrenous feet in this patient underscores the importance of adequate excision of necrotic or partially necrotic tissues because antibiotics cannot be effectively delivered to necrotic and poorly perfused tissues.

### Diabetic foot infections: state-of-the-art [^1131PbzH]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Foot infections are frequent and potentially devastating complications of diabetes. Unchecked, infection can progress contiguously to involve the deeper soft tissues and ultimately the bone. Foot ulcers in people with diabetes are most often the consequence of one or more of the following: peripheral sensory neuropathy, motor neuropathy and gait disorders, peripheral arterial insufficiency or immunological impairments. Infection develops in over half of foot ulcers and is the factor that most often leads to lower extremity amputation. These amputations are associated with substantial morbidity, reduced quality of life and major financial costs. Most infections can be successfully treated with optimal wound care, antibiotic therapy and surgical procedures. Employing evidence-based guidelines, multidisciplinary teams and institution-specific clinical pathways provides the best approach to guide clinicians through this multifaceted problem. All clinicians regularly seeing people with diabetes should have an understanding of how to prevent, diagnose and treat foot infections, which requires familiarity with the pathophysiology of the problem and the literature supporting currently recommended care.

Objective

To identify the impact of clindamycin use on mortality and amputation rates in patients with necrotizing fasciitis.

Design

Retrospective review.

Setting

Level 1 trauma center, single-center study.

Patients/Participants

All patients from 2008 to 2019 with a diagnosis of necrotizing fasciitis. One hundred ninety patients were included in statistical analysis.

Intervention

Use of clindamycin in the initial antibiotic regimen in the treatment of necrotizing soft tissue infection.

Main Outcome Measurements

Amputation and mortality rates.

Results

Patients who received clindamycin had 2.92 times reduced odds of having an amputation when compared with their counterparts, even when American Society of Anesthesiologist scores, comorbidities, smoking, drug use, alcohol consumption, race, ethnicity, sex, and age were controlled for and regardless of other antibiotics started (P = 0.015). There was no significant difference in mortality rate between those patients who did and did not receive clindamycin as part of their initial antibiotic regimen (8.3% vs. 11.6%, respectively; P = 0.453).

Conclusion

The use of clindamycin in the initial antibiotic regimen for treatment of NSTI was shown to significantly decrease rates of amputation but not mortality.

### Oral versus intravenous antibiotics for residual osteomyelitis after amputation in the diabetic foot [^112AyUHX]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

The standard management for residual osteomyelitis following amputation in a diabetic foot infection includes a prolonged course of intravenous antibiotic agents. The purpose of this analysis was to investigate whether oral antibiotic therapy led to treatment failure more than intravenous antibiotic therapy for this indication. The primary endpoint was treatment failure within one year of the initial amputation, defined by re-operation for residual osteomyelitic infection or a remaining nonhealing wound at the surgical site. All patients received at least 4 weeks of antibiotics and were chosen for oral or intravenous route of administration by infectious disease specialists. Characteristics including age, sex, hemoglobin A1c, BMI, tobacco use, PVD, homelessness and IDSA classification were also assessed for influence on antibiotic success and failure. Of the 65 patients meeting inclusion criteria, treatment failure occurred in 32 and treatment success occurred in 33. Of the treatment failures, 17 (53%) were in the intravenous group, and 15 (47%) were in the oral group. The differences between the modalities of antibiotic administration and their failure rates were not found to be statistically significant (p = .28 (proportional difference: -14%, 95% confidence interval [CI]:-36% to 10%)).

### Diabetic osteomyelitis: oral versus intravenous antibiotics at a single level 1 academic medical trauma center [^111iHUYq]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Residual osteomyelitis is a frequent problem following surgical intervention for diabetic foot infection. The Infectious Disease Society of America guidelines recommend a prolonged course of antibiotics for treatment of residual osteomyelitis. Recent literature suggests oral antibiotic therapy is not inferior to IV therapy. The primary aim of this study was to evaluate treatment success in 128 patients receiving oral versus IV antibiotics for residual osteomyelitis in the diabetic foot after amputation at a Level 1 academic medical trauma center. Treatment success was defined as completion of at least 4 weeks of antibiotic therapy, complete surgical wound healing, and no residual infection requiring further debridement or amputation within 1 year of the initial surgery. Patients with peripheral arterial disease were excluded. A retrospective chart review was performed, and we found no statistically significant difference in treatment success between these two groups (p = .2766). The median time to healing for oral antibiotic treatment was 3.17 months compared to 4.06 months for IV treatment (p = .1045). Furthermore, there was no significant difference in group demographics or comorbidities, aside from more patients in the IV group having coronary artery disease (p = .0416). The type of closure and whether the infection was single or polymicrobial were also not associated with a difference in outcomes between the two treatment arms. The results of the present study suggest oral antibiotics for treatment of residual osteomyelitis are not inferior to IV therapy and may be more efficacious for certain patients regarding cost and ease of administration.

### Current challenges in acute bacterial skin infection management [^115pZHJE]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

There are aspects of skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) that remain unresolved, such as current numbers, classification criteria, how best to define severity and predict the outcome, what diagnostic tests to perform, what new treatment options are available, or what the duration of antibiotic treatment should be. We have reviewed the literature over the last 18months to clarify these issues and provide our opinion.

Recent Findings

SSTIs are common and among the top 10 most frequent infections worldwide. They represent a burden on the healthcare system and have a major impact on the quality of life of patients. Regarding classification, the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) provides a practical guide that distinguishes between uncomplicated and complicated infections, acute and chronic wound infections, and necrotising and nonnecrotizing infections based on skin extension and tissue necrosis. With new microbiological and imaging diagnostic techniques, SSTIs can now be better diagnosed. New PCR techniques are available, and mass spectrometry can be applied to samples collected in liquid transport media. Moreover, new treatment methods such as photodynamic therapy, reactive oxygen, and phages are emerging. SSTI patients can be treated with shorter antibiotic courses if they receive an active drug with good tissue penetration. Antibiotic treatment in necrotizing infections can be shortened to 48h after the last debridement.

Summary

SSTIs remain a challenge regarding rapid and accurate diagnosis and clinical management.

Key points
- Necrotizing fasciitis is a rare, but serious bacterial infection.
- It can develop very quickly into a life-threatening emergency.
- Early symptoms include fever, severe pain, and an infection that spreads quickly.
- People with necrotizing fasciitis need immediate hospital care, antibiotics, and surgery.
- Speak with a healthcare provider if you have concerns about necrotizing fasciitis. Symptoms Necrotizing fasciitis spreads very quickly. Early symptoms can include:

- A red, warm, or swollen area of skin that spreads quickly
- Fever
- Severe pain, including beyond the area that's red, warm, or swollen. Complications Necrotizing fasciitis can lead to
- Organ failure
- Sepsis
- Shock It can also result in life-long complications from loss of limbs or severe scarring due to surgically removing infected tissue. Recent data show how deadly necrotizing fasciitis can be. Even with treatment, up to 1 in 5 people died from the infection.

Testing and diagnosis There are many infections that look similar to necrotizing fasciitis in the early stages, which can make diagnosis difficult. In addition to looking at the injury or infection, healthcare providers can diagnose necrotizing fasciitis with:

- Biopsies
- Bloodwork for signs of infection and muscle damage
- Imaging of the damaged area However, it's important to start treatment as soon as possible. Therefore, healthcare providers may not wait for test results if they think a patient might have necrotizing fasciitis. Treatment and recovery Necrotizing fasciitis is a very serious illness that requires hospital care. Antibiotics and surgery are typically necessary. Antibiotics To try to stop the infection, healthcare providers give antibiotics through an IV, which allows medicine to flow into a vein.

Sometimes, however, antibiotics can't reach all the infected areas because the bacteria have killed too much tissue and reduced blood flow. When this happens, healthcare providers must surgically remove the dead tissue. Surgery Since necrotizing fasciitis can spread rapidly, patients often must get surgery quickly. It's not unusual for someone with necrotizing fasciitis to end up needing multiple surgeries. In serious cases, the patient may need a blood transfusion.

Surgical site infections (SSIs) after operations — initial management and when to use antibiotics — are outlined as follows: surveillance standards mandate 30 days of follow-up for operations without placement of prosthetic material and for 1 year for operations where a prosthesis was inserted; the most important therapy for an SSI is to open the incision, evacuate the infected material, and continue dressing changes until the wound heals by secondary intention; if there is < 5 cm of erythema and induration with minimal systemic signs (temperature < 38.5°C, white blood cell (WBC) count < 12 000 cells/μL, and pulse < 100 beats/minute), antibiotics are unnecessary; patients with temperature > 38.5°C or heart rate > 110 beats/minute or erythema extending beyond the wound margins for > 5 cm may require a short course (eg, 24–48 hours) of antibiotics and opening of the suture line; for intestinal or female genital tract operations with mixed flora, antibiotics considered suitable for treatment of intra-abdominal infection are appropriate, and when MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) risk is present the initial antibiotic should include vancomycin, linezolid, daptomycin, telavancin, or ceftaroline plus piperacillin-tazobactam, a carbapenem, or ceftriaxone and metronidazole for gram-negative and anaerobic coverage; for incision and drainage of superficial abscesses, prophylactic antibiotics are not recommended.

### Diabetic foot disorders. A clinical practice guideline (2006 revision) [^1162fyQt]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2007). Medium credibility.

Diabetic foot infection — surgical, antimicrobial, and wound management is outlined as follows: Life-threatening infections necessitate immediate surgical attention without delay. Polymicrobial infection should be anticipated with gram positive cocci, gram negative rods, and anaerobic organisms predominating; accordingly, empirical antibiotic therapy typically includes broad-spectrum coverage for isolates from each of these three categories, and fully comprehensive empiric coverage is usually unnecessary unless the infection is life-threatening. Hospital therapies are usually initiated with intravenous medications, although most oral fluoroquinolones and oral linezolid have the same bioavailability as parenteral therapy, and current evidence available supports the efficacy of initial parenteral therapy followed by the appropriate oral agent. If recurrent infection develops during therapy, repeat cultures should be obtained to assess for superinfection. Methicillin-resistant staphylococci must be detected early and treated appropriately to avoid further tissue loss or extension of infection. The surgical wound may require repeated surgical debridement; wound care is initiated on day 1 or day 2 postsurgery and may initially involve saline gauze dressing changes, and negative pressure wound therapy (V. A.C. KCI, San Antonio, TX) has been found particularly useful. If the wound fails to show signs of healing, the patient's vascularity, nutritional status, infection control, and wound off-loading must be re-evaluated. Once soft tissue infection is under control and osseous infection management has been initiated, consideration may be given to wound closure or definitive amputation. Osteomyelitis and septic arthritis identified clinically or by imaging require a sampling of bone for microbiologic and histopathologic evaluation.

### Diagnosis and treatment of diabetic foot infections [^1126Tfnr]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: 1. Foot infections in patients with diabetes cause substantial morbidity and frequent visits to health care professionals and may lead to amputation of a lower extremity. 2. Diabetic foot infections require attention to local (foot) and systemic (metabolic) issues and coordinated management, preferably by a multidisciplinary foot-care team (A-II). The team managing these infections should include, or have ready access to, an infectious diseases specialist or a medical microbiologist (B-II). 3. The major predisposing factor to these infections is foot ulceration, which is usually related to peripheral neuropathy. Peripheral vascular disease and various immunological disturbances play a secondary role. 4. Aerobic Gram-positive cocci (especially Staphylococcus aureus) are the predominant pathogens in diabetic foot infections. Patients who have chronic wounds or who have recently received antibiotic therapy may also be infected with Gram-negative rods, and those with foot ischemia or gangrene may have obligate anaerobic pathogens. 5. Wound infections must be diagnosed clinically on the basis of local (and occasionally systemic) signs and symptoms of inflammation. Laboratory (including microbiological) investigations are of limited use for diagnosing infection, except in cases of osteomyelitis (B-II). 6. Send appropriately obtained specimens for culture before starting empirical antibiotic therapy in all cases of infection, except perhaps those that are mild and previously untreated (B-III). Tissue specimens obtained by biopsy, ulcer curettage, or aspiration are preferable to wound swab specimens (A-I). 7. Imaging studies may help diagnose or better define deep, soft-tissue purulent collections and are usually needed to detect pathological findings in bone. Plain radiography may be adequate in many cases, but MRI (in preference to isotope scanning) is more sensitive and specific, especially for detection of soft-tissue lesions (A-I). 8. Infections should be categorized by their severity on the basis of readily assessable clinical and laboratory features (B-II). Most important among these are the specific tissues involved, the adequacy of arterial perfusion, and the presence of systemic toxicity or metabolic instability. Categorization helps determine the degree of risk to the patient and the limb and, thus, the urgency and venue of management. 9. Available evidence does not support treating clinically uninfected ulcers with antibiotic therapy (D-III). Antibiotic therapy is necessary for virtually all infected wounds, but it is often insufficient without appropriate wound care. 10. Select an empirical antibiotic regimen on the basis of the severity of the infection and the likely etiologic agent(s) (B-II). Therapy aimed solely at aerobic Gram-positive cocci may be sufficient for mild-to-moderate infections in patients who have not recently received antibiotic therapy (A-II). Broad-spectrum empirical therapy is not routinely required but is indicated for severe infections, pending culture results and antibiotic susceptibility data (B-III). Take into consideration any recent antibiotic therapy and local antibiotic susceptibility data, especially the prevalence of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) or other resistant organisms. Definitive therapy should be based on both the culture results and susceptibility data and the clinical response to the empirical regimen (C-III). 11. There is only limited evidence with which to make informed choices among the various topical, oral, and parenteral antibiotic agents. Virtually all severe and some moderate infections require parenteral therapy, at least initially (C-III). Highly bioavailable oral antibiotics can be used in most mild and in many moderate infections, including some cases of osteomyelitis (A-II). Topical therapy may be used for some mild superficial infections (B-I). 12. Continue antibiotic therapy until there is evidence that the infection has resolved but not necessarily until a wound has healed. Suggestions for the duration of antibiotic therapy are as follows: for mild infections, 12 weeks usually suffices, but some require an additional 12 weeks; for moderate and severe infections, usually 24 weeks is sufficient, depending on the structures involved, the adequacy of debridement, the type of soft-tissue wound cover, and wound vascularity (A-II); and for osteomyelitis, generally at least 46 weeks is required, but a shorter duration is sufficient if the entire infected bone is removed, and probably a longer duration is needed if infected bone remains (B-II). 13. If an infection in a clinically stable patient fails to respond to 1 antibiotic courses, consider discontinuing all antimicrobials and, after a few days, obtaining optimal culture specimens (C-III). 14. Seek surgical consultation and, when needed, intervention for infections accompanied by a deep abscess, extensive bone or joint involvement, crepitus, substantial necrosis or gangrene, or necrotizing fasciitis (A-II). Evaluating the limb's arterial supply and revascularizing when indicated are particularly important. Surgeons with experience and interest in the field should be recruited by the foot-care team, if possible. 15. Providing optimal wound care, in addition to appropriate antibiotic treatment of the infection, is crucial for healing (A-I). This includes proper wound cleansing, debridement of any callus and necrotic tissue, and, especially, off-loading of pressure. There is insufficient evidence to recommend use of a specific wound dressing or any type of wound healing agents or products for infected foot wounds. 16. Patients with infected wounds require early and careful follow-up observation to ensure that the selected medical and surgical treatment regimens have been appropriate and effective (B-III). 17. Studies have not adequately defined the role of most adjunctive therapies for diabetic foot infections, but systematic reviews suggest that granulocyte colony-stimulating factors and systemic hyperbaric oxygen therapy may help prevent amputations (B-I). These treatments may be useful for severe infections or for those that have not adequately responded to therapy, despite correcting for all amenable local and systemic adverse factors. 18. Spread of infection to bone (osteitis or osteomyelitis) may be difficult to distinguish from noninfectious osteoarthropathy. Clinical examination and imaging tests may suffice, but bone biopsy is valuable for establishing the diagnosis of osteomyelitis, for defining the pathogenic organism(s), and for determining the antibiotic susceptibilities of such organisms (B-II). 19. Although this field has matured, further research is much needed. The committee especially recommends that adequately powered prospective studies be undertaken to elucidate and validate systems for classifying infection, diagnosing osteomyelitis, defining optimal antibiotic regimens in various situations, and clarifying the role of surgery in treating osteomyelitis (A-III).

### Determining the optimal antibiotic duration for skin and soft tissue infections [^112FyTjX]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Optimal duration of therapy in SSTIs - a heterogeneous group of infections - remains unknown. The advances in knowledge of antibiotic duration of treatment in selected SSTIs that can impact clinical practice and published in the last 18 months are reviewed.

Recent Findings

Recent evidence indicates that few patients receive guideline concordant empiric antibiotics and appropriate duration in the United States, although this likely can be extrapolated to other countries. One of the most commonly identified opportunities to improve antibiotic stewardship is duration of therapy more than 10 days. The long-standing debate regarding the significance of abscess size and its impact on clinical response to antibiotics, following proper drainage, is increasingly shifting towards the conclusion that abscess size is not directly associated with cure. In obese patients with SSTI, there is no benefit to longer antibiotic durations for SSTIs in patients with obesity, and it appears that longer antibiotic duration of therapy was associated with increased treatment failure. In diabetic foot infections (DFO), two randomized studies suggest that in the presence of osteomyelitis, the total duration of antibiotic therapy for patients treated nonsurgically does not need to be more than 6weeks. In a prospective, randomized, noninferiority, pilot trial, patients with DFO who underwent surgical debridement and received either a 3-week or 6-week course of antibiotic therapy had similar outcomes and antibiotic-related adverse events. In patients with necrotizing soft tissue infections, successive observational studies clearly suggest that short duration of antibiotic treatment after NSTI source control is as well tolerated and effective as a longer course. It appears that 48h would be enough. The possibility of fixed versus individualized approaches to therapy for common bacterial infections, including SSTIs merits to be considered seriously. Fully individualized therapy may be an ideal approach to maximize the benefits and minimize the harms of antimicrobials. Much more work is needed before this strategy becomes feasible.

Summary

There is increasing evidence that shorter duration of treatment is better in different types of SSTIs. Paradoxically, evaluation of real-life clinical practice indicates that long treatments continue to be commonly given to this population.

### Hyperbaric oxygen therapy in necrotizing soft tissue infections [^115yTKht]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Surgical debridement and antibiotics are the mainstays of therapy for patients with necrotizing soft tissue infections (NSTIs), but hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBO) is often used as an adjunctive measure. Despite this, the efficacy of HBO remains unclear. We hypothesized that HBO would have no effect on mortality or amputation rates.

Methods

We performed a retrospective analysis of our institutional experience from 2005 to 2009. Inclusion criteria were age > 18 y and discharge diagnosis of NSTI. We abstracted baseline demographics, physiology, laboratory values, and operative course from the medical record. The primary endpoint was in-hospital mortality; the secondary endpoint was extremity amputation rate. We compared baseline variables using Mann-Whitney, chi-square, and Fisher's exact test, as appropriate. Significance was set at P < 0.05.

Results

We identified 80 cases over the study period. The cohort was 54% male (n = 43) and 53% white (n = 43), and had a mean age of 55 ± 16 y. There were no significant differences in demographics, physiology, or comorbidities between groups. In-hospital mortality was not different between groups (16% in the HBO group versus 19% in the non-HBO group; P = 0.77). In patients with extremity NSTI, the amputation rate did not differ significantly between patients who did not receive HBO and those who did (17% versus 25%; P = 0.46).

Conclusions

Hyperbaric oxygen therapy does not appear to decrease in-hospital mortality or amputation rate after in patients with NSTI. There may be a role for HBO in treatment of NSTI; nevertheless, consideration of HBO should never delay operative therapy. Further evidence of efficacy is necessary before HBO can be considered the standard of care in NSTI.

### Collagenase santyl [^113fUYJ7]. FDA (2019). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Collagenase Santyl◊Ointment should be applied once daily (or more frequently if the dressing becomes soiled, as from incontinence). When clinically indicated, crosshatching thick eschar with a #10 blade allows Collagenase Santyl◊Ointment more surface contact with necrotic debris. It is also desirable to remove, with forceps and scissors, as much loosened detritus as can be done readily. Use Collagenase Santyl◊Ointment in the following manner:

1 - Prior to application the wound should be cleansed of debris and digested material by gently rubbing with a gauze pad saturated with normal saline solution, or with the desired cleansing agent compatible with Collagenase Santyl◊Ointment (See PRECAUTIONS), followed by a normal saline solution rinse.

2 - Whenever infection is present, it is desirable to use an appropriate topical antibiotic powder. The antibiotic should be applied to the wound prior to the application of Collagenase Santyl◊Ointment. Should the infection not respond, therapy with Collagenase Santyl◊Ointment should be discontinued until remission of the infection.

3 - Collagenase Santyl◊Ointment may be applied directly to the wound or to a sterile gauze pad which is then applied to the wound and properly secured.

4 - Use of Collagenase Santyl◊Ointment should be terminated when debridement of necrotic tissue is complete and granulation tissue is well established.

### Extended-course antibiotic prophylaxis in lower limb amputation: randomized clinical trial [^115YrqSS]. The British Journal of Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

The study ASSIT was published by Panayiotis Souroullas and colleagues in 2022 in the journal Br J Surg. This study is related to the following diseases: Diabetic neuropathy, Chronic limb-threatening ischemia and Nonvertebral osteomyelitis. In the ASSIT study, the trial question was: is extended-course antibiotic prophylaxis superior to short-course antibiotic prophylaxis in patients with lower limb amputation? In the ASSIT study, the study design was: single center, single blinded, RCT. In the ASSIT study, the population was: 152 patients (42 female, 110 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients undergoing minor and major lower limb amputation. The key exclusion criteria were known allergy to chlorhexidine/alcohol/iodophors; severe sepsis secondary to gas gangrene requiring multiple operations and admission to ICU; toe amputations. In the ASSIT study, the interventions were: n = 76 extended-course antibiotic prophylaxis (5-day antibiotic course) n = 76 short-course antibiotic prophylaxis (24-hour antibiotic course). In the ASSIT study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in surgical site infections at 30 days (11.8% vs. 39.5%; ARD -27.7, 95% CI -44.14 to -11.26). In the ASSIT study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in impaired wound healing (22.4% vs. 58%; RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.62) No significant difference in median duration of hospital stay (14 days vs. 15 days; AD -1 days, 95% CI -4.89 to 2.89) Significant decrease in patients who had to return to the theater (6.6% vs. 21%; ARD -14.4, 95% CI -25.36 to -3.44). In the ASSIT study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in death from any cause at 1 year, ICU admission, transfusion of blood products. In the ASSIT study, the conclusion was: in adult patients undergoing minor and major lower limb amputation, extended-course antibiotic prophylaxis were superior to short-course antibiotic prophylaxis with respect to surgical site infections at 30 days.

### Initial antibiotic therapy for postoperative moderate or severe diabetic foot infections: broad versus narrow spectrum, empirical versus targeted [^115qV2vc]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Aim

To retrospectively evaluate clinical and microbiological outcomes after combined surgical and medical therapy for diabetic foot infections (DFIs), stratifying between the empirical versus the targeted nature, and between an empirical broad versus a narrow-spectrum, antibiotic therapy.

Methods

We retrospectively assessed the rate of ultimate therapeutic failures for each of three types of initial postoperative antibiotic therapy: adequate empirical therapy; culture-guided therapy; and empirical inadequate therapy with a switch to targeted treatment based on available microbiological results.

Results

We included data from 332 patients who underwent 716 DFI episodes of surgical debridement, including partial amputations. Clinical failure occurred in 40 of 194 (20.6%) episodes where adequate empirical therapy was given, in 77 of 291 (26.5%) episodes using culture-guided (and correct) therapy from the start, and in 73 of 231 (31.6%) episodes with switching from empirical inadequate therapy to culture-targeted therapy. Equally, a broad-spectrum antibiotic choice could not alter this failure risk. Group comparisons, Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox regression analyses failed to show either statistical superiority or inferiority of any of the initial antibiotic strategies.

Conclusions

In this study, the microbiological adequacy of the initial antibiotic regimen after (surgical) debridement for DFI did not alter therapeutic outcomes. We recommend that clinicians follow the stewardship approach of avoiding antibiotic de-escalation and start with a narrow-spectrum regimen based on the local epidemiology.

### Executive summary: 2012 Infectious Diseases Society of America clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of diabetic foot infections [^112VzzR1]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Foot infections are a common and serious problem in persons with diabetes. Diabetic foot infections (DFIs) typically begin in a wound, most often a neuropathic ulceration. While all wounds are colonized with microorganisms, the presence of infection is defined by ≥ 2 classic findings of inflammation or purulence. Infections are then classified into mild (superficial and limited in size and depth), moderate (deeper or more extensive), or severe (accompanied by systemic signs or metabolic perturbations). This classification system, along with a vascular assessment, helps determine which patients should be hospitalized, which may require special imaging procedures or surgical interventions, and which will require amputation. Most DFIs are polymicrobial, with aerobic gram-positive cocci (GPC), and especially staphylococci, the most common causative organisms. Aerobic gram-negative bacilli are frequently copathogens in infections that are chronic or follow antibiotic treatment, and obligate anaerobes may be copathogens in ischemic or necrotic wounds. Wounds without evidence of soft tissue or bone infection do not require antibiotic therapy. For infected wounds, obtain a post-debridement specimen (preferably of tissue) for aerobic and anaerobic culture. Empiric antibiotic therapy can be narrowly targeted at GPC in many acutely infected patients, but those at risk for infection with antibiotic-resistant organisms or with chronic, previously treated, or severe infections usually require broader spectrum regimens. Imaging is helpful in most DFIs; plain radiographs may be sufficient, but magnetic resonance imaging is far more sensitive and specific. Osteomyelitis occurs in many diabetic patients with a foot wound and can be difficult to diagnose (optimally defined by bone culture and histology) and treat (often requiring surgical debridement or resection, and/or prolonged antibiotic therapy). Most DFIs require some surgical intervention, ranging from minor (debridement) to major (resection, amputation). Wounds must also be properly dressed and off-loaded of pressure, and patients need regular follow-up. An ischemic foot may require revascularization, and some nonresponding patients may benefit from selected adjunctive measures. Employing multidisciplinary foot teams improves outcomes. Clinicians and healthcare organizations should attempt to monitor, and thereby improve, their outcomes and processes in caring for DFIs.

### Long-term suppression of infection in total joint arthroplasty [^1117EBEe]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2003). Low credibility.

Optimal treatment for a chronic infected prosthesis is the removal of infected and necrotic tissue and all the components of the prosthesis with staged revision in conjunction with systemic antibiotics. If this is not possible because of the poor general condition of the patient, because of unacceptable functional results secondary to removal of the prosthesis, or because the patient refuses surgery in an attempt to salvage the infected prosthesis, a reasonable alternative is long-term oral suppressive antibiotic therapy for maintenance of a functioning prosthesis. Prompt recognition with rapid debridement and initiation of antibiotic therapy seems crucial. Our study confirms a favorable outcome of maintenance of functioning prostheses in 86.2% of patients after a mean followup of 5 years. All patients had initial debridement with 4 to 6 weeks of systemic antibiotic therapy. Advanced age did not seem to predict poor outcome. Joint location, duration of symptoms, and the time of onset of infection did not predict success or failure. The overall success rate for Staphylococcus aureus prosthetic joint infection was 69% after a mean followup of 5 years. The ideal regimen and optimal duration of oral suppressive therapy for a favorable outcome is not well-established and needs additional data with prospective multicenter studies.

### Infection after orthopaedic trauma: prevention and treatment [^115FGq6q]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2016). Low credibility.

Trauma to the extremities is disproportionately represented in casualties of recent conflicts, accounting for > 50% of injuries sustained during operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. Infectious complications have been reported in > 25% of those evacuated for trauma, and 50% of such patients were treated in the intensive care unit (ICU). Osteomyelitis has been reported in 9% (14% of intensive care unit patients), and deep-wound infection in 27% of type III open-tibia fractures. Infections complicating extremity trauma are frequently caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria and have been demonstrated to lead to failure of limb salvage, unplanned operative take-backs, late amputations, and decreased likelihood of returning to duty. Invasive fungal infections of extremities have also presented a unique challenge in combat-injured patients, particularly in those with blast injuries with massive transfusion requirements and high injury severity scores. Infection prevention should begin at the time of injury and, although context-specific depending on the level of care, includes appropriate irrigation, surgical debridement, wound care and coverage, fracture fixation, and antibiotic prophylaxis, in addition to basic infection prevention measures. Clinical practice guidelines to address infection prevention after combat trauma (including extremity infection) were developed in 2007 and revised in 2011, with endorsement from the Surgical Infection Society and the Infectious Disease Society of America. Nevertheless, significant challenges remain, including austere environments of care, multiple transitions of care, and lack of coordinated efforts in prevention. Treatment of established infections is optimally multidisciplinary, particularly when deep wounds, bone, and joints are involved. Surgical debridement of overtly infected or necrotic tissue is necessary, with particularly aggressive margins if invasive fungal infection is suspected. Infected nonunion frequently requires the use of prosthetic materials for fixation, potentiating biofilm formation, and complicating medical therapy. Antibiotic therapy should be targeted at results of deep wound and bone cultures. However, this is complicated by frequent contamination of wounds, requiring differentiation between potential pathogens in terms of their virulence and decreased culture recovery in patient who have frequently received previous antibiotics. Lessons learned in infection prevention and treatment of orthopaedic trauma from combat can serve to inform the care of patients injured in natural disasters and noncombat trauma.

### Diabetic foot infection [^1112LV6w]. American Family Physician (2008). Low credibility.

Foot infections are common in patients with diabetes and are associated with high morbidity and risk of lower extremity amputation. Diabetic foot infections are classified as mild, moderate, or severe. Gram-positive bacteria, such as Staphylococcus aureus and beta-hemolytic streptococci, are the most common pathogens in previously untreated mild and moderate infection. Severe, chronic, or previously treated infections are often polymicrobial. The diagnosis of diabetic foot infection is based on the clinical signs and symptoms of local inflammation. Infected wounds should be cultured after debridement. Tissue specimens obtained by scraping the base of the ulcer with a scalpel or by wound or bone biopsy are strongly preferred to wound swabs. Imaging studies are indicated for suspected deep soft tissue purulent collections or osteomyelitis. Optimal management requires aggressive surgical debridement and wound management, effective antibiotic therapy, and correction of metabolic abnormalities (mainly hyperglycemia and arterial insufficiency). Treatment with antibiotics is not required for noninfected ulcers. Mild soft tissue infection can be treated effectively with oral antibiotics, including dicloxacillin, cephalexin, and clindamycin. Severe soft tissue infection can be initially treated intravenously with ciprofloxacin plus clindamycin; piperacillin/tazobactam; or imipenem/cilastatin. The risk of methicillin-resistant S. aureus infection should be considered when choosing a regimen. Antibiotic treatment should last from one to four weeks for soft tissue infection and six to 12 weeks for osteomyelitis and should be followed by culture-guided definitive therapy.
