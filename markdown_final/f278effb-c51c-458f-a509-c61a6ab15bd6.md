## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a step-by-step framework for diagnosing malaria. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about pre-test probability and clinical suspicion. Then, I should select the initial diagnostic modality by healthcare setting. Next, I will review performance characteristics and technical pitfalls of microscopy, RDTs, and molecular tests. After that, I need to outline proper specimen collection and quality steps. I will then interpret results using Bayesian reasoning and address discordant findings. I should also consider special populations, the role of serial testing, and laboratory quality assurance and referral pathways. Finally, I will review newer technologies and cost–stewardship considerations, and close with a concise decision algorithm anchored to guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm how to establish pre-test probability and clinical suspicion, because missing malaria early is a common and dangerous error. I need to ensure we anchor on epidemiologic risk (travel or residence in endemic areas, time since exposure), compatible symptoms (fever, chills, headache), pregnancy status, and prophylaxis adherence, and I should remind myself that WHO recommends parasitological confirmation for all suspected cases and explicitly discourages mass testing or treatment in the absence of clinical suspicion, which keeps us focused on targeted testing rather than screening everyone indiscriminately [^116X7EmR] [^112UwCv2]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — diagnosis is often delayed in non-endemic settings due to low index of suspicion, so I should double-check travel histories and maintain vigilance for imported malaria, as underscored by reviews noting frequent diagnostic delays and misdiagnosis in the U.S. and other non-endemic regions [^112z4N6G] [^112f1MX2] [^111qeRem].

> Next, I should select the initial diagnostic modality based on the healthcare setting, and I need to be explicit about why. In resource-limited endemic settings, RDTs are the most feasible first-line tests because they are rapid and can be deployed at the point of care, aligning with WHO policy and Cochrane syntheses on community-based fever management, though I must remember that their sensitivity can fall in low-transmission contexts and for non-falciparum species [^1155fntD] [^112zjmht] [^112TetDc]. In hospitals and referral centers, especially in non-endemic or urban endemic settings, I should verify that the dual approach — RDT plus microscopy — is standard, since microscopy remains the reference for species identification, parasite quantification, and treatment guidance, and BSH explicitly cautions against relying on RDTs alone [^115PnbHB] [^113rUP4T] [^113goyYe]. For reference laboratories or complex cases, I need to check when to escalate to molecular methods (PCR or LAMP), particularly with discordant results or low parasitemia, understanding that while these are most sensitive, they are not point-of-care and entail greater cost and turnaround time [^114wjnGq] [^113qsuGz].

> Now, I will examine performance characteristics to avoid overinterpreting any single result. Microscopy offers high specificity and good sensitivity with expert readers but can miss very low parasitemia; typical detection limits for thick smears are approximately 4–20 parasites/µL under ideal conditions but higher in the field, and observer skill is pivotal to accuracy, which is why it remains the "gold standard" operationally and for species quantitation [^111YUeF6] [^113rUP4T]. RDTs perform excellently for P. falciparum in many settings, and I initially thought their sensitivity approached 97–100% across the board, but wait, let me verify — those figures come largely from specific contexts such as UK pediatric ED cohorts where P. falciparum sensitivity was indeed 100%, while sensitivity for non-falciparum species is clearly lower; I should correct my earlier overgeneralization and emphasize that vivax and other non-falciparum infections are more frequently missed by many RDTs [^113MdG4U] [^114Ljn8H]. For low-density infections, LAMP and PCR outperform both microscopy and RDTs; LAMP has shown sensitivity around 97% against qPCR with excellent specificity, and PCR can detect down to 0.004 parasites/µL, but both are constrained by infrastructure and time, limiting frontline utility even as they provide crucial adjudication in difficult cases [^114wjnGq] [^111YUeF6].

> I need to ensure proper specimen collection and test procedures because pre-analytic and analytic quality directly determine reliability. Let me double-check BSH guidance: thick films for detection and thin films for species identification and quantification, with Giemsa at pH 7.2 for thin films and Giemsa or Field stain for thick films; two trained observers should examine each slide, and at least 200 high-power fields must be reviewed before declaring a smear negative [^113rUP4T] [^1144D1FA]. If thick films are positive, I should confirm species and quantify parasitemia on thin films, reporting percentage parasitemia or parasites per mL for falciparum or knowlesi, since treatment decisions and severity grading depend on that quantification [^1166mWEx] [^1144D1FA]. For RDTs, I must adhere strictly to manufacturer instructions and, when available, perform RDTs in parallel with films so that a rapid result informs initial management without substituting for species-level microscopy where it matters for therapy [^115PnbHB] [^113qsuGz].

> I will now interpret results using Bayesian reasoning tied to pre-test probability, carefully avoiding false reassurance. A positive RDT in a high-prevalence setting typically confers a high post-test probability of malaria, but I should confirm species and quantify parasitemia by microscopy to tailor treatment and assess severity; treatment for suspected severe falciparum should not be delayed while awaiting microscopy if clinical concern is high [^111YUeF6] [^115pGdWP]. For a negative RDT in a high-prevalence or high-suspicion context, I need to be cautious; the negative predictive value declines as prevalence rises, and although one UK pediatric ED study showed an NPV of 99.8% overall and 100% for falciparum, wait, I should verify applicability — those data reflect a low-prevalence context, so in high-prevalence areas or with non-falciparum suspicion, serial testing and microscopy remain necessary, correcting any tendency to overrely on an initial negative RDT [^113MdG4U] [^112TetDc]. If discordance arises, such as RDT positive but microscopy negative, I should consider persistent HRP2 antigen after recent treatment, very low parasitemia below microscopy detection, or a false positive; conversely, RDT negative with microscopy positive suggests non-falciparum infection, low-density parasitemia, or HRP2/pfhrp2 deletion issues, and I should refer discrepant or positive cases to a reference laboratory for confirmation and speciation as per BSH [^112syaLn] [^111YUeF6].

> Hold on, I should verify special population nuances that change test choice and threshold to act. In pregnancy, microscopy is preferred for species identification and quantification because RDTs may miss low parasitemia and placental sequestration limits peripheral detection; additional placental histology and PCR may be needed near delivery, and undetected infections are associated with adverse outcomes like maternal anemia, so I should keep a lower threshold for molecular testing when suspicion persists [^1147uCNH] [^111kTcwF]. In children, RDT implementation can shorten time to diagnosis and treatment in non-endemic hospitals, but I should still account for slightly lower sensitivity in younger children and maintain backup microscopy, keeping in mind that clinical outcomes hinge on prompt therapy rather than the specific initial test alone [^112N33uk] [^113MdG4U]. For suspected severe malaria, I must not delay parenteral artesunate initiation while arranging urgent RDT and immediate microscopy, aligning with severity criteria from CATMAT to triage and treat decisively [^115pGdWP].

> Let me reconsider the role of serial testing, because I do not want to miss low-density or non-falciparum infections after an initially negative screen. Traditional teaching advised three serial thick/thin films to exclude malaria; in the era of concurrent RDT plus microscopy, most diagnoses are made on the first set, but a small proportion — especially vivax — will be detected only on subsequent samples, so if clinical suspicion remains high, or there was recent antimalarial exposure that can suppress parasitemia, I should repeat testing over 24–48 hours rather than falsely closing the case [^114tUCzt] [^111YUeF6]. I should double-check that guidance is consistent with local transmission patterns; in lower endemicity or after partial treatment, serial testing becomes more important due to intermittent or submicroscopic parasitemia, and that nuance should be communicated to frontline teams [^114wjnGq] [^111qeRem].

> Next, I should review laboratory quality assurance and the referral pathway to prevent analytic errors. BSH 2022 mandates that positive specimens and RDT–film discrepancies be sent to a reference laboratory, which is especially important when species identification is uncertain or when results conflict with the clinical picture; maintaining competency, ongoing training, and internal QC, including blinded slide review, are essential components of a safe diagnostic program [^112syaLn] [^1144D1FA]. I need to ensure staff are aware of lookalikes such as babesiosis when intraerythrocytic parasites are seen but travel history or RDTs do not fit; this is a classic pitfall in non-endemic countries where laboratory experience is limited, as U.S. surveys show very few labs meet full CLSI standards despite 24/7 availability [^116bYaYP] [^117YDD25].

> I will now examine the selective role of newer technologies without overstating their readiness. LAMP provides near-PCR sensitivity and high specificity and can reduce microscopy workload in non-endemic settings when used as a screening step, though it still requires laboratory infrastructure and is not strictly point-of-care; early resource-sparing strategies suggest substantial time savings in training and operations, which is attractive where case volumes are low [^114wjnGq] [^112Wc3ii]. Magneto-optical hemozoin devices like Gazelle show promising field performance near microscopy levels and may be particularly useful where pfhrp2 deletions undermine HRP2-based RDTs, but I should confirm local validation before routine adoption, and I must remember these do not replace species-level confirmation for therapy [^1148ERFa] [^113goyYe]. AI-based microscopy can approach expert performance in some settings and may scale for high-volume slide reading, but it requires rigorous external validation and QA integration before clinical deployment [^1178N2Sa] [^113qsuGz].

> But wait, what about cost-effectiveness and stewardship — do better tests actually improve care if clinicians ignore results? The ACT Consortium synthesis shows RDTs reduce unnecessary ACT use compared with clinical diagnosis, yet antimalarials are still often prescribed to RDT-negative patients and antibiotics surge in their place; thus, test introduction must be paired with adherence and fever management training to realize benefits [^117BECpi] [^117DACaz]. A cost–benefit analysis from Tanzania is a good reminder: testing strategies are only cost-beneficial when clinicians act consistently with results; if they override negative tests, costs can increase by 10–250%, eroding the value of diagnostics [^114AoDPp]. I need to ensure program design ties results to clear treatment pathways and supportive supervision to maintain fidelity at the point of care [^1155fntD].

> To close, I should synthesize a practical decision pathway and double-check it aligns with guidelines. Begin by assessing exposure and symptoms to set pre-test probability and test all suspected cases parasitologically rather than treating presumptively; in community or resource-limited settings, start with an RDT and add microscopy when available; in hospitals, perform RDT plus microscopy simultaneously for rapid triage and definitive species identification and quantification; in pregnancy, favor microscopy and consider molecular methods when suspicion persists; in severe disease, start parenteral artesunate without delay while obtaining urgent diagnostics; if initial tests are negative but suspicion remains, repeat testing over 24–48 hours and consider molecular assays in reference labs; refer all positives and discordant results for expert confirmation, and embed QA, training, and adherence to results to ensure both clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the diagnostic strategy [^116X7EmR] [^115PnbHB] [^115pGdWP] [^114tUCzt] [^112syaLn].

Malaria diagnosis relies on **microscopy as the gold standard** for species identification and parasitemia quantification [^113rUP4T] [^111YUeF6] [^1144D1FA], while **RDTs for rapid screening** are essential in resource-limited settings [^117DACaz] [^114o8ykC]. Molecular methods (PCR, LAMP) offer high sensitivity for low-density or mixed infections [^114wjnGq] [^112Wc3ii] but require specialized resources [^113qsuGz]. WHO recommends **parasitological confirmation for all suspected cases**, with RDTs as the primary tool where microscopy is unavailable [^116X7EmR] [^112zjmht]. Limitations include operator dependence [^113qsuGz], low parasitemia detection [^111YUeF6], and HRP2 deletions [^113goyYe]; emerging technologies like magneto-optical devices and AI-assisted microscopy may improve future diagnostics [^1148ERFa] [^1178N2Sa].

## Microscopy

Microscopy remains the **gold standard** for malaria diagnosis, providing detailed information on parasite species, stage, and density [^111YUeF6] [^113rUP4T]. Thick films are more sensitive for low parasitemia detection [^111YUeF6], while thin films enable accurate species identification and quantification [^113rUP4T] [^1166mWEx]. The British Society for Haematology (BSH) recommends that two trained observers examine thick films, each reviewing at least 200 high-power fields, and that thin films be used for species identification if thick films are positive [^1144D1FA].

---

## Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs)

RDTs detect malaria antigens (HRP2, pLDH, aldolase) [^1136FC2k] and provide results within 15–20 minutes, making them valuable in resource-limited settings [^1144c3aj] [^112zjmht] [^114o8ykC]. HRP2-based RDTs are **highly sensitive for Plasmodium falciparum** but may yield false negatives due to HRP2 gene deletions or low parasitemia [^113goyYe] [^114o8ykC]. They are less sensitive for non-falciparum species, especially Plasmodium vivax, Plasmodium ovale, and Plasmodium malariae [^114Ljn8H] [^114xq69s].

---

## Molecular methods

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) are **highly sensitive and specific** [^111YUeF6], capable of detecting low-density and mixed infections [^114wjnGq] [^116rVCK4]. PCR is the reference standard for detecting asymptomatic and low-density infections [^111YUeF6], whereas LAMP provides a simpler, faster alternative suitable for field settings [^112Wc3ii] [^113qsuGz].

---

## Emerging diagnostic technologies

Emerging technologies, such as magneto-optical devices (e.g. Gazelle) and artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted microscopy, show promise for improving malaria diagnosis [^115uBoof]. Magneto-optical devices detect hemozoin crystals produced by malaria parasites, providing rapid, accurate results without the need for skilled microscopists [^1148ERFa]. AI-assisted microscopy can **automate parasite detection and quantification**, reducing operator dependence and improving accuracy [^1178N2Sa].

---

## WHO recommendations

The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends **parasitological confirmation of all suspected malaria cases** using microscopy or RDTs [^116X7EmR]. RDTs are the primary tool in resource-limited settings where microscopy is unavailable or impractical [^112zjmht]. Molecular methods are recommended for reference laboratories and research settings, particularly to detect low-density or asymptomatic infections [^111qeRem] [^111YUeF6].

---

## Limitations and challenges

Malaria diagnosis faces several challenges, including **operator dependence**, limited sensitivity at low parasitemia, and false negatives due to HRP2 deletions [^113qsuGz] [^111YUeF6] [^113goyYe]. Diagnostic accuracy also varies by species, with non-falciparum infections often underdiagnosed [^114Ljn8H] [^114xq69s]. Emerging technologies and improved training are essential to address these limitations [^117YDD25].

Malaria diagnosis relies on microscopy, RDTs, and molecular methods, each with strengths and limitations [^113qsuGz]. WHO recommends **parasitological confirmation for all suspected cases**, with RDTs as the primary tool in resource-limited settings [^116X7EmR]. Emerging technologies like magneto-optical devices and AI-assisted microscopy may improve future diagnostics [^115uBoof] [^1178N2Sa].

### Malaria rapid diagnostic tests [^114o8ykC]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Global efforts to control malaria are more complex than those for other infectious diseases, in part because of vector transmission, the complex clinical presentation of Plasmodium infections, more than one Plasmodium species causing infection, geographic distribution of vectors and infection, and drug resistance. The World Health Organization's approach to global malaria control focuses on two components: vector control, and diagnosis and treatment of clinical malaria. Although microscopy performed on peripheral blood smears remains the most widely used diagnostic test and the standard against which other tests are measured, rapid expansion of diagnostic testing worldwide will require the use of other diagnostic approaches. This review will focus on the malaria rapid diagnostic test (MRDT) for detecting malaria parasitemia, both in terms of performance characteristics of MRDTs and how they are used under field conditions. The emphasis will be on the performance and use of MRDTs in regions of endemicity, particularly sub-Saharan Africa, where most malaria-related deaths occur.

### Use of loop-mediated isothermal amplification in a resource-saving strategy for primary malaria screening in a non-endemic setting [^112Wc3ii]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2019). Low credibility.

Malaria is traditionally diagnosed by blood smear microscopy, which requires continuous resource-demanding training. In areas with only a few cases of malaria, a simple and rapid test that can reliably exclude malaria could significantly reduce the need for microscopy and training. We evaluated whether loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) for screening malaria parasites could reduce the workload in the diagnosis of malaria.

Loop-mediated isothermal amplification was used to analyze 38 ethylene-diamine-tetraacetic acid (EDTA) blood samples from 23 patients who had previously been tested for malaria by microscopy, antigen-based rapid diagnostic test (antigen-RDT), and in-house real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The samples included blood with low-level parasitaemia and samples with discrepancies between the results of the different methods. Loop-mediated isothermal amplification detected malaria parasites in 27 of 28 samples that were positive according to in-house RT-PCR. There were negative microscopy results in 10 of these and negative antigen-RDT results in 11. The sample with a negative LAMP result and positive in-house RT-PCR result was from a patient who had recently been treated for low-level Plasmodium falciparum malaria parasitaemia.

We found LAMP to be reliable for malaria screening and suitable for replacing microscopy without loss of performance. The low number of LAMP-positive samples needing microscopy can be handled by a limited number of trained microscopists. The time saved on training and documentation was estimated to be 520 working hours.

### First successful field evaluation of new, one-minute haemozoin-based malaria diagnostic device [^1148ERFa]. EClinicalMedicine (2020). Low credibility.

Early and accurate diagnosis of malaria is critical to the success of malaria elimination. However, the mainstay of malaria diagnosis in the field, such as light microscopy and rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs), has limitations due to low parasite density or mutations in diagnostic markers.

- **Methods**: We evaluated an inexpensive, robust, rapid malaria diagnostic device, called Gazelle, that employs magneto-optical detection to identify haemozoin crystals (Hz) produced by all species of human malaria parasites in infected individuals. A beam of polarised light is passed through the lysed diluted blood sample under the influence of high (~0.55T) and low magnetic fields. The difference in light transmission through the sample between the high and low magnetic fields indicates the presence of Hz, suggesting possible malarial infection. A total of 300 febrile patients were screened at the malaria clinic of the Indian Council of Medical Research-National Institute of Research in Tribal Health (ICMR-NIRTH), Jabalpur, India, from August 2018 to November 2018. Malaria diagnosis was done using four diagnostic methods: Gazelle, light microscopy, RDT, and malaria-specific Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). Measures of diagnostic accuracy were compared.

- **Findings**: Out of 300 febrile patients enrolled and tested for the presence of malaria parasites, 262 patient samples were included in the final analysis. The sensitivity and specificity of Gazelle were 98% and 97% in comparison to light microscopy, 82% and 99% to PCR, and 78% and 99% to RDT, respectively.

### Performance evaluation of different strategies based on microscopy techniques, rapid diagnostic test and molecular loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay for the diagnosis of imported malaria [^114wjnGq]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2020). Low credibility.

Malaria is one of the most common tropical diseases encountered in travelers and migrants. It requires an urgent and reliable diagnosis considering its potential severity. In this study, the performance of five diagnostic assays was evaluated in a non-endemic region and compared prospectively to quantitative PCR (qPCR).

A prospective study was conducted at Toulouse Hospital from August 2017 to January 2018 and included all patients with initial Plasmodium screening. Thin and thick blood smears (TnS, TkS), quantitative buffy coat (QBC), rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs), and commercial loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) were independently performed on each blood sample and compared to the qPCR reference standard.

The study encompassed 331 patients, mainly returning from Africa. qPCR detected 73 Plasmodium-positive samples (including 58 falciparum). Individually, LAMP had a 97.3% (71/73) sensitivity, far ahead of TnS (84.9%, 62/73), TkS (86.3%, 63/73), QBC (86.3%, 63/73), and RDT (86.3%, 63/73). RDT demonstrated a high sensitivity for falciparum (98.3%, 57/58) but missed all ovale, malariae, and knowlesi infections. Specificity was excellent for all techniques (99.6–100%).

The most sensitive diagnostic strategies were TnS + RDT (95.9%, 70/73), TnS + LAMP (97.3%, 71/73), and TnS + RDT + LAMP (100%, 73/73), about 10% higher than strategies using exclusively microscopy, TkS + TnS (87.7%, 64/73), or QBC + TnS (87.7%, 64/73). TnS remains necessary for Plasmodium species identification and quantification. Adding sequentially TnS only on LAMP-positive samples increases the accuracy.

### Expert-level automated malaria diagnosis on routine blood films with deep neural networks [^1178N2Sa]. American Journal of Hematology (2020). Low credibility.

Each year, over 200 million cases of malaria globally result in half a million deaths. Accurate malaria diagnosis continues to be challenging. Automated imaging processing approaches to analyze Thick Blood Films (TBF) could provide scalable solutions for urban healthcare providers in the holoendemic malaria regions of sub-Saharan Africa. Although several approaches have been attempted to identify malaria parasites in TBF, none have achieved the negative and positive predictive performance suitable for clinical use in the western sub-Saharan region.

While malaria parasite object detection is an intermediary step in attaining automatic patient diagnosis, training state-of-the-art deep-learning object detectors demands the human-expert, labor-intensive process of labeling a large dataset of digitized TBF. To overcome these challenges and develop a clinically usable system, we present a novel approach that leverages routine clinical-microscopy labels from our quality-controlled malaria clinics. This is used to train a Deep Malaria Convolutional Neural Network classifier (DeepMCNN) for automated malaria diagnosis. Our system also provides total Malaria Parasite (MP) and White Blood Cell (WBC) counts allowing parasitemia estimation in MP/μL, as recommended by the WHO.

The prospective validation of the DeepMCNN achieves sensitivity/specificity of 0.92/0.90 against expert-level malaria diagnosis. Our approach's positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) performance of 0.92/0.90 is clinically usable in our holoendemic settings, particularly in the densely populated metropolis of Ibadan, located in Nigeria, the most populous African country.

### Rapid diagnostic tests for Plasmodium vivax malaria in endemic countries [^114YZgMN]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Low credibility.

Malaria is a life-threatening disease caused by Plasmodium species (Plasmodium spp.), transmitted by the bite of a female Anopheles mosquito. Currently, there are five established Plasmodium spp. that cause malaria in humans. The two most common are Plasmodium falciparum (P. falciparum) and Plasmodium vivax (P. vivax). P. vivax malaria is a relapsing form, which is rarely fatal but can cause serious anaemia in children [White 2018].

There has been an increased focus on P. vivax, as malaria-endemic settings that also have P. falciparum have made progress in P. falciparum control. In the World Health Organization (WHO) regions of the Americas, South-East Asia, and Eastern Mediterranean, P. vivax is the predominant Plasmodium spp. and causes 64%, greater than 30%, and greater than 40% of all malaria cases, respectively, in these regions [WHO 2017a]. People with malaria caused by P. vivax can have relapses due to the dormant liver stage hypnozoites. People can carry hypnozoites ranging from a few weeks to more than 12 months before reporting symptoms again [Campo 2015].

Primaquine is recommended in addition to standard malaria treatment for P. vivax and Plasmodium ovale (P. ovale) to clear these liver stage parasites. Due to this, it is important to have diagnostic tests that are highly sensitive and that can specifically detect P. vivax from other Plasmodium spp.

### Treatment of malaria in the United States: A systematic review [^112z4N6G]. JAMA (2007). Low credibility.

Many US clinicians and laboratory personnel are unfamiliar with the diagnosis and treatment of malaria.

- **Objectives**: The objectives of this study are to examine the evidence base for the management of uncomplicated and severe malaria and to provide clinicians with practical recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of malaria in the United States.

- **Evidence acquisition**: A systematic MEDLINE search was conducted from 1966 to 2006 using the search term 'malaria' with subheadings including congenital, diagnosis, drug therapy, epidemiology, and therapy. Additional references were obtained by searching the bibliographies of pertinent articles and by reviewing articles suggested by experts in the treatment of malaria in North America.

- **Evidence synthesis**: Important measures to reduce morbidity and mortality from malaria in the United States include obtaining a travel history, considering malaria in the differential diagnosis of fever based on that history, and ensuring prompt and accurate diagnosis and treatment. Chloroquine remains the treatment of choice for Plasmodium falciparum acquired in areas without chloroquine-resistant strains. In regions with chloroquine resistance, a combination of atovaquone and proguanil, or quinine plus tetracycline or doxycycline or clindamycin, are the best treatment options. Chloroquine remains the treatment of choice for all other malaria species, with the exception of P. vivax acquired in Indonesia or Papua New Guinea, where atovaquone-proguanil is preferred, with mefloquine or quinine plus tetracycline or doxycycline as alternatives.

### Imported malaria: An update [^112f1MX2]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Evidence suggests that imported malaria presents a significant diagnostic challenge, with initial misdiagnosis rates of 40% or greater. Given that prompt diagnosis and appropriate treatment are the only interventions proven to prevent progression to severe malaria and death, these figures are concerning. This clinical review aims to provide the most up-to-date and practical information on the diagnosis and treatment of imported malaria for emergency health care providers.

- **Common pitfalls**: We highlight common pitfalls, errors, and mistakes in arriving at the correct diagnosis.
- **Key aspects to avoid severe disease progression**: We emphasize three key aspects: rapid diagnosis, prompt initiation of treatment, and appropriate choice of antimalarial treatment.

### The diagnosis and treatment of malaria in pregnancy: Green–top guideline no. 54b [^1147uCNH]. RCOG (2010). High credibility.

For malaria infection in pregnant patients, the RCOG 2010 guidelines recommend obtaining a microscopic diagnosis for species identification and estimation of parasitemia to initiate appropriate antimalarial treatment. It is important to recognize that rapid detection tests may miss low parasitemia, which is more likely in pregnant patients, and these tests are relatively insensitive in P. vivax malaria.

### Rapid diagnostic tests for diagnosing uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria in endemic countries [^1136FC2k]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for Plasmodium falciparum malaria use antibodies to detect either HRP-2 antigen or pLDH antigen, and can improve access to diagnostics in developing countries.

- **Objectives**: To assess the diagnostic accuracy of RDTs for detecting P. falciparum parasitaemia in persons living in endemic areas who present to ambulatory healthcare facilities with symptoms suggestive of malaria by type and brand.

- **Search strategy**: We undertook a comprehensive search of the following databases: Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register; MEDLINE; EMBASE; MEDION; Science Citation Index; Web of Knowledge; African Index Medicus; LILACS; IndMED, up to January 14, 2010.

- **Selection criteria**: Studies comparing RDTs with a reference standard (microscopy or polymerase chain reaction) in blood samples from a random or consecutive series of patients attending ambulatory health facilities with symptoms suggestive of malaria in P. falciparum endemic areas.

- **Data collection and analysis**: For each study, a standard set of data was extracted independently by two authors, using a tailored data extraction form. Comparisons were grouped hierarchically by target antigen, and type and brand of RDT, and combined in meta-analysis where appropriate.

- **Main results**: We identified 74 unique studies as eligible for this review and categorized them according to the antigens they detected. Types 1 to 3 include HRP-2 (from P. falciparum) either by itself or with other antigens. Types 4 and 5 included pLDH (from P. falciparum) either by itself or with other antigens.

### Rapid diagnostic tests versus clinical diagnosis for managing people with fever in malaria endemic settings [^117DACaz]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). High credibility.

We have presented a summary of the risk of bias assessment in Figure 3.

- **Risk of bias summary**: Review authors' judgments about each risk of bias item for each included trial. Green indicates a low risk of bias, red a high risk of bias, and yellow an unclear risk of bias.

- **Allocation**: Only one trial adequately described both sequence generation and allocation concealment to be considered at low risk of selection bias (Ansah 2010 GHA). The remaining six trials were at unclear risk due to inadequate descriptions of allocation concealment.

- **Blinding**: Blinding of participants and health workers to the use of RDTs was not possible; however, blinding of the outcome assessment was possible in all trials but was not described in any of them.

- **Incomplete outcome data**: Attrition bias was at low risk of bias (≤ 3%) in six trials, and in one trial, the attrition rate was high (30%) and unequal in the two arms (Skarbinski 2009 KEN).

- **Selective reporting**: All trials reported outcomes that were pre-specified in the methods sections of their protocols and reports, indicating a low risk of selective reporting.

- **Other potential sources of bias**: Three trials (Ansah 2010 GHA; Skarbinski 2009 KEN; Yeboah-Antwi 2010 ZAM) acknowledged baseline imbalance in the number or quality of the health workers enrolled in the trial, which were adjusted for using different methods.

See Table 1 for a summary of the results and GRADE appraisal of the quality of evidence.

### Adding rapid diagnostic tests to community-based programmes for treating malaria [^112zjmht]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). High credibility.

The intervention encompasses a wide range of activities in home- and community-based management of suspected malaria cases. Winch (2005) categorized interventions for managing malaria or pneumonia in children outside health facilities into seven models, six pertinent to malaria management. These models are differentiated by who assesses the sick child, whether it is the family or a community health worker (CHW), the diagnostic method used (microscopy, rapid diagnostic tests [mRDT], or clinical assessment), who provides the antimalarial medication (CHW or family), and the referral method to the nearest health facility [Winch 2005].

The responsibilities of those involved often include prevention, health promotion specific to malaria, and the identification and management of cases [Sunguya 2017]. Antimalarial providers also include registered or unregistered drug shops offering private services, which vary in diagnostic and case management capacity and training.

The WHO guidelines for managing malaria have significantly advanced since 2006 [WHO 2006; WHO 2010b; WHO 2015; WHO 2021b; WHO 2022]. While artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) continue to be recommended for uncomplicated malaria, there is a growing emphasis on utilizing parasitological testing via RDTs or microscopy before treatment. This strategy aims to enhance care for parasite-positive individuals, pinpoint parasite-negative individuals who may have other conditions so they can receive adequate treatment, and ensure rational use of antimalarials [WHO 2021b; WHO 2022].

Regarding specific circumstances for malaria infection, more specifically with respect to pregnant patients in obstetric care, the RCOG 2010 guidelines recommend obtaining standard microscopy of thick and thin blood films at birth. Additionally, weekly blood films should be conducted for 28 days to screen for malaria in all neonates whose mothers developed malaria during pregnancy.

### Clinical impact of malaria rapid diagnostic testing at a US children's hospital [^112N33uk]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2020). Low credibility.

Children who develop malaria after returning to a setting in which the disease is not endemic are at high risk for critical delays in diagnosis and initiation of antimalarial therapy. We assessed the clinical impact of the implementation of malaria rapid diagnostic testing (RDT) on the management of children with malaria at an urban US children's hospital that serves a large immigrant population.

- **Methods**: This was a retrospective cohort study of all children diagnosed with laboratory-confirmed malaria at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) between 2000 and 2014. RDT using a US Food and Drug Administration-approved immunochromatographic assay was introduced at CHOP on August 1, 2007. We compared clinical management and outcomes of patients with malaria diagnosed before and after RDT introduction.

- **Results**: We analyzed 82 pediatric malaria cases (32 before and 50 after RDT implementation). The majority of these patients had traveled to West Africa (91.5%) and were infected with Plasmodium falciparum (80.5%). The mean time to a positive result decreased from 10.4 to 0.9 hours (P < .001) after the introduction of RDT for patients with P falciparum. The mean time to antimalarial therapy decreased from 13.1 to 6.9 hours (P = 0.023) in hospitalized patients. We found no significant reduction in the mean number of clinical signs of severe malaria between 0 and 48 hours of hospitalization and no difference in the need for exchange transfusion, time to resolution of parasitemia, or length of hospital stay.

### Rapid diagnostic tests for diagnosing uncomplicated non-falciparum or Plasmodium vivax malaria in endemic countries [^114Ljn8H]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

In settings where both *Plasmodium vivax* and *Plasmodium falciparum* infections cause malaria, rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) need to distinguish which species is causing the patients' symptoms, as different treatments are required. Older RDTs incorporated two test lines to distinguish malaria due to *P. falciparum* from malaria due to any other *Plasmodium* species (non-falciparum). These RDTs can be classified according to which antibodies they use:

- **Type 2 rdts**: Use HRP-2 (for *P. falciparum*) and aldolase (all species).
- **Type 3 rdts**: Use HRP-2 (for *P. falciparum*) and pLDH (all species).
- **Type 4 rdts**: Use pLDH (from *P. falciparum*) and pLDH (all species).

More recently, RDTs have been developed to distinguish *P. vivax* parasitaemia by utilizing a pLDH antibody specific to *P. vivax*.

The objective of this study was to assess the diagnostic accuracy of RDTs for detecting non-falciparum or *P. vivax* parasitaemia in people living in malaria-endemic areas who present to ambulatory healthcare facilities with symptoms suggestive of malaria. Furthermore, the study aimed to identify which types and brands of commercial tests best detect non-falciparum and *P. vivax* malaria.

A comprehensive search of various databases was conducted up to 31 December 2013, including the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register, MEDLINE, EMBASE, MEDION, Science Citation Index, Web of Knowledge, African Index Medicus, LILACS, and IndMED.

Studies selected for this analysis compared RDTs with a reference standard (microscopy or polymerase chain reaction) in blood samples from a random or consecutive series of patients.

### How to manage adult patients with malaria in the non-endemic setting [^111qeRem]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2024). High credibility.

The diagnosis and management of malaria in non-endemic countries present a continuing challenge. Plasmodium falciparum, capable of rapidly inducing severe and life-threatening multiorgan disease, is the species most frequently diagnosed in Europe and North America.

- **Objectives**: To summarise the most relevant diagnostic findings and clinical features of malaria observed in non-endemic settings and to provide an update of the key management decision points using three illustrative clinical scenarios of uncomplicated and severe malaria.

- **Sources**: The discussion is based on a relevant literature search spanning the last 20 years. Recommendations are based on available clinical guidelines, including those of the WHO, observational studies conducted in non-endemic settings, and, when available, extrapolation from randomised studies from malaria-endemic settings.

- **Content**: The following topics are covered: diagnosis, including the use of molecular biology; clinical characteristics; management with a specific focus on complicated (severe) and uncomplicated malaria; and areas of resistance to available antimalarial drugs.

- **Implications**: Malaria imported to non-endemic settings, especially P. falciparum malaria, is sometimes initially overlooked, and delayed diagnosis is responsible for preventable deaths every year. This review aims to raise awareness of malaria outside endemic countries and provide clinicians with a practical guide for efficient diagnosis and targeted therapy for the different species involved.

### Rapid diagnostic tests for diagnosing uncomplicated non-falciparum or Plasmodium vivax malaria in endemic countries [^111YUeF6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Microscopic examination of Giemsa-stained thick and thin blood films remains the conventional laboratory method and is still regarded as the 'gold standard'. Microscopic examination provides good sensitivity and specificity, and it allows species and stage differentiation as well as quantification of parasites, all of which are important in assessing the disease severity and prescribing appropriate therapy. Intensive examination is more likely to reveal parasitaemia, so the test is carried out with a fixed number of fields examined. Infections may be missed if slides are not examined carefully.

Very low parasitaemia may be missed even by good quality microscopy; the limit of detection of thick smear microscopy has been estimated at approximately four to 20 asexual parasites per µL. However, under field conditions, a threshold of 50 to 100 asexual parasites per µL is more realistic. False positive results are also possible; if blood slides are not prepared carefully, artefacts may form that can be mistaken for Plasmodium parasites.

The polymerase chain reaction (PCR), a molecular method based on DNA amplification, is the most accurate method of detecting parasites in the blood. Compared to microscopy, PCR is less prone to observer error and more sensitive at low levels of parasitaemia. For PCR, the limit of detection may be as low as 0.004 asexual parasites per µL. However, it remains unclear whether this increased ability to detect low level parasitaemia makes it.

### Accuracy of malaria diagnostic tests performed on non-invasively collected samples: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^113iUq2u]. BMJ Global Health (2021). Low credibility.

In settings where PCR is available, saliva and urine samples may be considered for PCR-based malaria diagnosis only if blood samples cannot be collected, given the lower sensitivity found. The performance of RDT in the urine remains limited, especially its sensitivity. Malaria testing on non-invasively collected specimens still needs substantial improvement, especially for RDT, in order to be considered for widespread use.

### British Society for Haematology guidelines for the laboratory diagnosis of malaria [^116bYaYP]. British Journal of Haematology (2022). High credibility.

Regarding quality improvement for malaria infection, particularly concerning laboratory quality control, the BSH 2022 guidelines recommend ensuring that laboratory personnel are aware of the differential diagnosis of babesiosis. This is especially important when intra-erythrocytic parasites are observed, but travel history and/or rapid diagnostic test results do not indicate a diagnosis of malaria.

### Rapid diagnostic tests versus clinical diagnosis for managing people with fever in malaria endemic settings [^117MDK7b]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

In 2010, the World Health Organization recommended that all patients with suspected malaria be tested for malaria before treatment. In rural African settings, light microscopy is often unavailable. Diagnosis has traditionally relied on detecting fever, and most individuals were given antimalarial drugs presumptively. Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) provide a point-of-care test that may improve management, particularly of people for whom the RDT excludes the diagnosis of malaria.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate whether introducing RDTs into algorithms for diagnosing and treating people with fever improves health outcomes, reduces antimalarial prescribing, and is safe, compared to algorithms using clinical diagnosis.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Infectious Disease Group Specialized Register; CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library); MEDLINE; EMBASE; CINAHL; LILACS; and the metaRegister of Controlled Trials for eligible trials up to 10 January 2014. Researchers in the field were contacted, and the reference lists of all included trials were reviewed to identify any additional trials.

- **Selection criteria**: Individual or cluster randomized trials (RCTs) comparing RDT-supported algorithms and algorithms using clinical diagnosis alone for diagnosing and treating people with fever living in malaria-endemic settings.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors independently applied the inclusion criteria and extracted data. We combined data from individual and cluster RCTs using the generic inverse variance method. All outcomes were presented as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

### Adding rapid diagnostic tests to community-based programmes for treating malaria [^112hMTPw]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). High credibility.

We integrated the risk of bias into a certainty of evidence assessment for each meta-analyzed outcome using the GRADE approach. This resulted in very low-certainty evidence for the primary mortality outcomes due to extremely serious imprecision. However, there was moderate-certainty evidence for the outcome of antimalarial use in microscopy- or PCR-negative people and high-certainty evidence for the outcome of appropriateness of treatment.

- **Antimalarial use and treatment outcomes**: We downgraded the certainty of evidence on antimalarial use in microscopy- or PCR-negative people for serious inconsistency, although heterogeneity was partially explained in the subgroup analysis. We downgraded the certainty of the evidence relating to the number of people treated with an antimalarial by two levels for risk of bias concerns due to lack of blinding and an overall unclear to high risk of bias and for inconsistency. Finally, we downgraded the certainty of evidence on the use of antibiotics following a negative mRDT result by one level to moderate for serious imprecision, with a wide 95% CI including a trivial effect (estimate crosses the small effect threshold), despite the optimal information size being met.

- **Potential biases in the review process**: Strengths of this review include the use of recognized Cochrane methods and tools, the absence of language or publication date filters in the search, and the overall completeness of data. Where appropriately adjusted effect estimates were not available, we adjusted our effect estimates (for binary outcomes) by dividing both the numerator and denominator by the…

### A systematic literature review of microscopy methods reported in malaria clinical trials [^116u8CfT]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Low credibility.

Microscopy of stained blood films is essential for the diagnosis of malaria, differentiation of parasite species, and estimation of parasite density. These assessments are crucial for evaluating antimalarial drug efficacy. The accuracy and comparability of these measures over time and space are vital to discerning the emergence or spread of antimalarial drug resistance. Although evidence-based guidelines for malaria microscopy methods exist, traditional microscopy techniques for parasitological assessments are subject to considerable methodological variations. This review aimed to critically explore how microscopy methods were reported in published malaria studies between 2013 and 2017, focusing on outlining the methodological differences and improving reporting standards in practice.

### Rapid diagnostic testing for Plasmodium vivax and nonfalciparum malaria in endemic areas [^114xq69s]. JAMA (2015). Low credibility.

How sensitive and specific are rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for diagnosing Plasmodium vivax and nonfalciparum malaria in endemic areas?

Vivax-specific RDTs were highly sensitive and specific when compared with microscopy (the gold standard) for detecting P. vivax malaria. RDTs that can only distinguish Plasmodium falciparum from nonfalciparum malaria were less sensitive.

### The impact of introducing malaria rapid diagnostic tests on fever case management: A synthesis of ten studies from the ACT Consortium [^117BECpi]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2017). Low credibility.

Since 2010, the World Health Organization has recommended that all suspected cases of malaria be confirmed with parasite-based diagnosis before treatment. These guidelines represent a paradigm shift away from presumptive antimalarial treatment of fever. Malaria rapid diagnostic tests (mRDTs) are central to implementing this policy, intended to target artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACT) to patients with confirmed malaria and to improve management of patients with nonmalarial fevers. The ACT Consortium conducted ten linked studies, eight in sub-Saharan Africa and two in Afghanistan, to evaluate the impact of mRDT introduction on case management across settings that vary in malaria endemicity and healthcare provider type.

This synthesis includes 562,368 outpatient encounters (study size range 2,400–432,513). mRDTs were associated with significantly lower ACT prescription (range 8–69% versus 20–100%). Prescribing did not always adhere to malaria test results; in several settings, ACTs were prescribed to more than 30% of test-negative patients or to fewer than 80% of test-positive patients. Either an antimalarial or an antibiotic was prescribed for more than 75% of patients across most settings; lower antimalarial prescription for malaria test-negative patients was partly offset by higher antibiotic prescription. Symptomatic management with antipyretics alone was prescribed for fewer than 25% of patients across all scenarios. In community health worker and private retailer settings, mRDTs increased referral of patients to other providers.

### Diagnosis of malaria by magnetic deposition microscopy [^115bNMi6]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2006). Low credibility.

Although malaria contributes to a significant public health burden, its diagnosis heavily relies on non-specific clinical symptoms or blood smear microscopy methods developed in the 1930s. These approaches severely misrepresent the number of infected individuals and the reservoir of parasites in malaria-endemic communities, undermining efforts to control the disease. Limitations of conventional microscopy-based diagnosis include the time required to examine slides, the time required to attain expertise sufficient to diagnose infection accurately, and attrition from the limited number of existing malaria microscopy experts.

Earlier studies described magnetic properties of *Plasmodium falciparum* but did not refine methods to diagnose infection by all four human malaria parasite species. Following specific technical procedures, we show that it is possible to concentrate all four human malaria parasite species, at least 40-fold, on microscope slides using very inexpensive magnets through an approach termed magnetic deposition microscopy. This approach delivered greater sensitivity than a thick smear preparation while maintaining the clarity of a thin smear to simplify species-specific diagnosis.

The magnetic force necessary to concentrate parasites on the slide is focused at a precise position relative to the magnet surface, making it possible to examine a specific region of the slide for parasitized cells. This avoids the time-consuming process of scanning the entire slide surface. These results provide insight regarding new strategies for performing malaria blood smears.

### How hidden can malaria be in pregnant women? Diagnosis by microscopy, placental histology, polymerase chain reaction and detection of histidine-rich protein 2 in plasma [^111kTcwF]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Accurate diagnosis of malaria infection during pregnancy remains challenging due to low parasite densities and placental sequestration of Plasmodium falciparum. The performance of different methods to detect P. falciparum in pregnancy and the clinical relevance of undetected infections were evaluated.

- **Methods**: P. falciparum infections were assessed in 272 Mozambican women at delivery by microscopy, placental histology, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), and detection of histidine-rich protein 2 (HRP2) in plasma by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and a rapid diagnostic test (RDT). Association between infection and delivery outcomes was determined.

- **Results**: Among the 122 women qPCR-positive for P. falciparum in peripheral and/or placental blood samples, 87 (71.3%) did not receive a positive diagnosis by peripheral microscopy, 75 (61.5%) by HRP2 ELISA, and 74 (60.7%) by HRP2 RDT in plasma. Fifty-seven of the 98 qPCR-positive placental infections (58.2%) were not detected by histology. Women who were qPCR-positive but negative in their peripheral blood by microscopy or HRP2 RDT in plasma (n = 62) were at increased risk of anemia compared with negative women (n = 141; odds ratio, 2.03; 95% confidence interval, 1.07–3.83; p = 0.029).

- **Conclusions**: Microscopy, placental histology, and HRP2-based plasma diagnostic methods fail to identify the majority of the P. falciparum infections detected by qPCR in peripheral and placental blood. Undetected infections were associated with maternal anemia, highlighting the urgent need for more accurate malaria diagnostic techniques.

### Adding rapid diagnostic tests to community-based programmes for treating malaria [^114kchFS]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). High credibility.

The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends parasitological testing of all suspected malaria cases using malaria rapid diagnostic tests (mRDTs) or microscopy prior to treatment. Some governments have extended this responsibility to community health workers (CHWs) to reduce malaria morbidity and mortality through prompt and appropriate treatment. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2013.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate community-based management strategies for treating malaria or fever that incorporate both a definitive diagnosis with an mRDT and appropriate antimalarial treatment.

- **Search methods**: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, five other databases, and three trials registers up to 14 September 2021.

- **Selection criteria**: We included individually randomized trials and cluster-randomized controlled trials (cRCTs), controlled before-after studies, and controlled interrupted time series studies in people living in malaria-endemic areas. These studies compared programmes that train CHWs and drug shop vendors to perform mRDTs and provide appropriate treatment versus similar programmes that do not use mRDTs, and versus routine health facility care.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We used standard Cochrane methods. For each dichotomous outcome, we extracted the number of participants with the event and the total number of participants in each group, unless studies presented results at a population level only. Primary outcomes were all-cause mortality, hospitalizations, and number of people receiving an antimalarial within 24 hours.

### Multicenter study to evaluate the OptiMAL test for rapid diagnosis of malaria in U.S. hospitals [^1144c3aj]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2003). Low credibility.

More than 1,000 cases of malaria are diagnosed each year in the United States. However, reported numbers may be artificially low because many clinicians fail to consider the diagnosis during presentation. U.S. hospital laboratory technologists have very limited experience in detecting and identifying malaria parasites, and the reporting of malaria to state health departments is sporadic in many states.

In this study, a rapid malaria diagnostic test, the OptiMAL test (DiaMed; under license from Flow Inc, Portland, Oreg.), was evaluated in six U.S. hospitals and compared with results of microscopy. The OptiMAL test is a 15-minute rapid immunochromatographic test that both identifies and differentiates Plasmodium falciparum from non-P. falciparum malaria parasites based on the detection of parasite lactate dehydrogenase in a drop of patient blood. A total of 216 specimens from patients suspected of having malaria were tested. Results indicated that 43 samples (20%) were positive for malaria parasites by microscopy (32 P. falciparum, 11 non-P. falciparum), while 42 (19%) were positive by OptiMAL (31 P. falciparum, 11 non-P. falciparum). The sensitivity of the OptiMAL test was 98%; its specificity was 100%, with positive and negative predictive values of 100% and 99%, respectively.

Participating hospital physicians and laboratory directors independently reported that the OptiMAL rapid malaria test was accurate, easy to use, and well accepted by those working in their diagnostic laboratories. The overall conclusion was that integration of the OptiMAL rapid malaria test into U.S. hospitals is viable due to its effectiveness and user acceptance.

### Rapid diagnostic tests for diagnosing uncomplicated non-falciparum or Plasmodium vivax malaria in endemic countries [^114YC6DK]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

A diagnostic test that is simple to perform, rapid, and accurate is important in many situations to ensure prompt specific treatment, reduce misdiagnosis of non-malarial illness as malaria, limit the development of drug resistance, and reduce drug wastage. The WHO lists some of the situations where rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) can be particularly useful, such as in remote areas without access to expert microscopy, complex emergencies, and severe malaria where rapid diagnosis is essential to save lives.

The WHO 2010 guidelines recommend chloroquine for P. vivax malaria in areas in which parasites remain sensitive to this drug, although they are currently considering recommending artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) for all P. vivax infections as they are effective. Primaquine may be added to the immediate treatment of P. vivax (and P. ovale) to effect a radical cure and prevent relapse. Therefore, in areas where both P. falciparum and P. vivax are endemic, it is often useful to be able to distinguish between the two species.

### Is serial testing required to diagnose imported malaria in the era of rapid diagnostic tests [^114tUCzt]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2013). Low credibility.

The exclusion of malaria traditionally requires three negative serial thick and thin blood films. However, many clinical laboratories now routinely perform rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) in addition to blood films when malaria is suspected. We sought to determine whether serial testing is necessary in this setting. We examined 388 cases of malaria diagnosed during 1999–2010 at three laboratories in Melbourne, Australia. For each case, we ascertained whether the diagnosis was made on initial or follow-up testing. Nine cases (3.5%) were diagnosed following a negative initial blood film and RDT: seven Plasmodium vivax, one P. ovale, and one P. falciparum. Of four case-patients with P. vivax in which clinical data were available, all had recent exposure to antimalarial medication. Our data suggest that among patients who have not received recent anti-malarial therapy, and when RDTs are performed and blood films are prepared, most malaria diagnoses are made by using the first set of tests.

### Rapid diagnostic tests versus clinical diagnosis for managing people with fever in malaria endemic settings [^1155fntD]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). High credibility.

Why it is important to do this review

The World Health Organization now recommends that all suspected malaria cases receive a parasitological diagnosis prior to treatment, and rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) are the most feasible way of achieving this in rural areas of Africa.

For policymakers seeking to introduce and improve malaria diagnosis in rural settings, this review aims to evaluate the effect of introducing RDTs into clinical algorithms on both the health outcomes for patients and the unnecessary overuse of antimalarials. For health workers in rural areas, this review also aims to evaluate the safety of RDT‐supported algorithms and the potential for patients to be misdiagnosed as non‐malaria and sent home without appropriate treatment.

### Adding rapid diagnostic tests to community-based programmes for treating malaria [^111PzNUc]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). High credibility.

- **Summary of findings**: The effectiveness of the malaria rapid diagnostic test (mRDT) compared to clinical diagnosis in community-based malaria programmes shows promising results. When used in community-based care, mRDTs improve the diagnostic accuracy for malaria, which can lead to better treatment outcomes.

- **Malaria rapid diagnostic test (mRDT) in community-based care versus health facility care**: Utilizing mRDTs in community-based settings provides a viable alternative to health facility care for people with suspected malaria. This approach not only increases access to accurate diagnoses but can also reduce the burden on healthcare facilities.

### Diagnostic performance of rapid diagnostic tests versus blood smears for malaria in US clinical practice [^115jGzoS]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Approximately 4 million US travelers to developing countries are ill enough to seek health care, with 1,500 malaria cases reported in the United States annually. The diagnosis of malaria is frequently delayed because of the time required to prepare malaria blood films and lack of technical expertise. An easy, reliable rapid diagnostic test (RDT) with high sensitivity and negative predictive value (NPV), particularly for *Plasmodium falciparum*, would be clinically useful. The objective of this study was to determine the diagnostic performance of an RDT approved by the US Food and Drug Administration compared with traditional thick and thin blood smears for malaria diagnosis.

- **Methods**: This prospective study tested 852 consecutive blood samples that underwent thick and thin smears and blinded malaria RDTs at three hospital laboratories from 2003 to 2006. Polymerase chain reaction verified positive test results and discordant results.

- **Results**: Malaria was noted in 95 (11%) of the 852 samples. The RDT had superior performance than the standard Giemsa thick blood smear (p = .003). The RDT's sensitivity for all malaria was 97% (92 of 95 samples), compared with 85% (81 of 95) for the blood smear, and the RDT had a superior NPV of 99.6%, compared with 98.2% for the blood smear (p = .001). The *P. falciparum* performance was excellent, with 100% rapid test sensitivity, compared with only 88% (65 of 74) by blood smear (p = .003).

### The impact of response to the results of diagnostic tests for malaria: Cost-benefit analysis [^114AoDPp]. BMJ (2008). Low credibility.

Rapid diagnostic tests for malaria seem cost-effective in standard analyses, but these do not take account of clinicians' responses to test results. This study tested the impact of clinicians' response to rapid diagnostic test or microscopy results on the costs and benefits of testing at different levels of malaria transmission and in different age groups.

- **Design**: Cost-benefit analysis using a decision tree model and clinical data on the effectiveness of diagnostic tests for malaria, their costs, and clinicians' responses to test results.

- **Setting**: Tanzania.

- **Methods**: Data were obtained from a clinical trial of 2,425 patients carried out in three settings of varying transmission.

- **Results**: At moderate and low levels of malaria transmission, rapid diagnostic tests were more cost-beneficial than microscopy, and both more so than presumptive treatment, but only where the response was consistent with the test results. At the levels of prescription of antimalarial drugs to patients with negative tests that have been found in observational studies and trials, neither test method is likely to be cost-beneficial, incurring costs 10–250% higher, depending on transmission rate, than would have been the case with fully consistent responses to all test results. Microscopy becomes more cost-beneficial than rapid diagnostic tests when its sensitivity under operational conditions approaches that of rapid diagnostic tests.

- **Conclusions**: Improving diagnostic methods, including rapid diagnostic tests, can reduce costs and enhance the benefits of effective antimalarial drugs, but only if the response to test results is fully consistent.

### Rapid diagnostic tests versus clinical diagnosis for managing people with fever in malaria endemic settings [^117NuwRC]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

We analysed the data using Review Manager (RevMan). Where we had pooled data, we used the generic inverse variance method, which allows for meta‐analysis of both individually and cluster randomized trials. When we detected moderate levels of heterogeneity, we combined trials using the random‐effects model, which assumes the trials are estimating different, but related, intervention effects.

We assessed the quality of evidence across each outcome measure using the GRADE approach. The quality rating across trials has four levels: high, moderate, low, or very low. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are initially categorized as high quality but can be downgraded after assessment of five criteria: risk of bias, consistency, directness, imprecision, and publication bias.

Where we detected moderate heterogeneity, we performed subgroup analyses by stratifying results by the level of health worker adherence to the rapid diagnostic test (RDT) result, the level of malaria endemicity, and the age group of the targeted population.

### Rapid diagnostic tests for diagnosing uncomplicated non-falciparum or Plasmodium vivax malaria in endemic countries [^113WUweR]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

- **Methods - Criteria for considering studies for this review**:

- **Types of studies**: Studies sampling a consecutive series of patients, or a randomly selected series of patients, were eligible. Where the report did not explicitly state that sampling was consecutive, but we judged that consecutive sampling was most probable, we included the report. We excluded studies if they did not present sufficient data to allow us to extract absolute numbers of true positives, false positives, false negatives, and true negatives. Due to resource constraints, we also excluded studies if the report did not present enough information to allow full assessment of eligibility or if the study was reported only in a non-English language.

- **Participants**: Studies recruiting people living in P. vivax, P. ovale, or P. malariae endemic areas attending ambulatory healthcare settings with symptoms of uncomplicated malaria were eligible.

	- **We excluded studies if participants**:
		- were non-immune people returning from endemic countries or were mainly recent migrant or displaced populations from non-endemic or very low endemicity areas;
		- had been treated for malaria and the test was performed to assess treatment outcome;
		- had symptoms of severe malaria;
		- did not have symptoms of malaria;
		- were recruited through active case finding (for example, door-to-door surveys).

In studies where only a subgroup of participants was eligible for inclusion in the review, we included the study provided that we could extract relevant data specific to that subgroup. If studies included some patients with severe malaria, and we could not extract separate data for the eligible subgroup, they were excluded from the review.

### Update on malaria diagnostics and test utilization [^113qsuGz]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2017). Low credibility.

Malaria is a potentially life-threatening disease requiring rapid diagnosis and treatment. Although microscopic examination of thick and thin blood films remains the gold standard for laboratory diagnosis, rapid antigen tests and nucleic acid amplification methods may also play a useful role in the detection of acute infection.

### Rapid diagnostic tests for diagnosing uncomplicated non-falciparum or Plasmodium vivax malaria in endemic countries [^114WCHEq]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). High credibility.

Data extraction and management

Two review authors independently extracted data and resolved any discrepancies by discussion. In cases of studies where only a subgroup of participants met the review inclusion criteria, data was extracted and presented only for that particular subgroup. Where two versions of one reference standard were used, for example local clinic and expert standard microscopy, or field versus laboratory RDT testing, only the one most likely to yield the highest quality results was included.

For each study, data on the characteristics of the study were systematically extracted, as shown in Appendix 2. Data relating to the sensitivity of the RDT at different levels of parasitaemia (asexual parasites per µL of blood) as presented by the study authors was also extracted. For each comparison of index test with reference test, data on the number of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives was extracted in the form of a two by two table. RDT results are dichotomous; microscopy results were deemed positive at any level of asexual parasitaemia; and PCR results used the cut-off points presented by the study authors. Gametocyte-only parasitaemia was considered negative; where a study was unclear on how they had classed gametocyte-only parasitaemia, it was assumed they used the same classification as this review and the data was included in the study.

Data was extracted for each study using manufacturers' instructions in interpreting the RDT results. P. falciparum malaria only was considered as negative.

### Limited level of accuracy provided by available rapid diagnosis tests for malaria enhances the need for PCR-based reference laboratories [^112XqHnB]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2001). Low credibility.

The rise of imported malaria cases and the high fatality rate in Europe make the search for new and easy diagnostic methods necessary. Rapid diagnosis tests (RDTs) are, in part, developed to cover the lack of diagnostic experience. Unfortunately, our data suggest that the accuracy of RDTs is insufficient and could increase the number of incorrect malaria diagnoses.

### Rapid diagnostic tests compared with malaria microscopy for guiding outpatient treatment of febrile illness in Tanzania: Randomised trial [^115BBGmo]. BMJ (2007). Low credibility.

To compare rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for malaria with routine microscopy in guiding treatment decisions for febrile patients, a randomised trial was conducted in outpatient departments in northeast Tanzania at varying levels of malaria transmission. The study included 2,416 patients for whom a malaria test was requested.

- **Intervention**: Staff received training on rapid diagnostic tests, and patients sent for malaria tests were randomised to receive either a rapid diagnostic test or routine microscopy.

- **Main outcome measure**: The primary focus was the proportion of patients with a negative test prescribed an antimalarial drug.

- **Results**: Out of 7,589 outpatient consultations, 2,425 (32%) had a malaria test requested. Of the 1,204 patients randomised to microscopy, 1,030 (86%) tested negative for malaria; 523 (51%) of these were treated with an antimalarial drug. Among the 1,193 patients randomised to the rapid diagnostic test, 1,005 (84%) tested negative; 540 (54%) of these were treated for malaria (odds ratio 1.13, 95% confidence interval 0.95 to 1.34; P = 0.18). Children aged under 5 with negative rapid diagnostic tests were more likely to be prescribed an antimalarial drug than those with negative slides (P = 0.003). Patients with a negative test by any method were more likely to be prescribed an antibiotic (odds ratio 6.42, 4.72 to 8.75; P < 0.001). More than 90% of prescriptions for antimalarial drugs in low to moderate transmission settings were for patients for whom a test requested by a clinician was negative for malaria.

- **Conclusions**: Although many cases of malaria are missed outside the formal sector, within it, malaria is massively underdiagnosed and often results in incorrect treatment.

### First successful field evaluation of new, one-minute haemozoin-based malaria diagnostic device [^115uBoof]. EClinicalMedicine (2020). Low credibility.

Research in context

- **Evidence before this study**: Microscopy and rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) are widely employed diagnostic tools for malaria in field and resource-poor healthcare settings. However, the diagnosis of malaria by microscopy is often not feasible due to a lack of infrastructure, unavailability of skilled microscopists, and erratic power supply. Furthermore, the performance of RDTs is affected by low-density parasitemia and Pfhrp-2 gene deletion. We searched PubMed for alternative diagnostic tools that can be used in place of or in combination with existing tools for malaria diagnosis in resource-poor settings. Although a number of alternative diagnostic tools were found, none were suitable for field conditions, community health centers (CHC), primary health centers (PHC), or community surveys.

- **Added value of this study**: In the present study, we conducted a successful field evaluation of the magneto-optical device (Gazelle) for the diagnosis of malaria. The performance (sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy) of the device Gazelle was similar to microscopy and RDTs. Furthermore, it is a quick, battery-operated, physically rugged device with a digital interface that can be operated with little training in resource-poor settings with erratic power supply.

- **Implications of all the available evidence**: The device Gazelle may be an important alternative diagnostic tool in areas where Pfhrp-2 deletion is prevalent. Furthermore, it may be an important diagnostic tool in mass surveys and resource-poor settings in the field. The device may be a useful remedy for the lack of skilled microscopists, which compromises malaria diagnosis across the globe.

### First successful field evaluation of new, one-minute haemozoin-based malaria diagnostic device [^113goyYe]. EClinicalMedicine (2020). Low credibility.

Malaria is primarily diagnosed by microscopy and/or rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) at both primary and community health centers in India. Although microscopy is considered the gold standard for malaria diagnosis, its use depends on the availability of a well-functioning light microscope, clean glass slides, immersion oil with appropriate optical properties, fresh filtered reagents for staining, and most importantly, a skilled microscopist. Furthermore, microscopy is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and its accuracy is affected by low parasitemia. Due to ease of handling, RDTs are increasingly used to diagnose malaria in resource-poor settings and field conditions. A total of 276 million RDTs for malaria were sold worldwide in 2017.

RDTs provide qualitative results for malaria and are limited in the number of malaria species they can diagnose. They are also less effective in cases of low parasitemia and infection with P. falciparum lacking histidine-rich protein-2 (Pfhrp2) in malaria-endemic regions. Loop mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is a relatively new technique employing the rapid amplification and detection of DNA. This method has been successfully demonstrated to detect malaria with promising results in comparison to microscopy, RDT, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR), although it is not suitable for field conditions. PCR is a highly sensitive and specific technique that can detect low-level parasitemia, but it is relatively expensive and requires advanced laboratory equipment and technologically skilled execution.

### Malaria: An update for physicians [^1166bmwm]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Malaria remains the most important parasitic infection in humans. There have been significant advances in the treatment of both nonsevere and severe malaria with the advent of artemisinin combination therapies and parenteral artesunate, but the optimum supportive management of severe malaria is unclear. A broadly acceptable therapy for the prevention of relapses in *Plasmodium vivax* infection has not been discovered. Globally, the priority remains to prevent infection in the vulnerable, move toward elimination where feasible, and ensure that effective treatment is available to all. In developed settings, prevention of infection and its early recognition are crucial.

### British society for haematology guidelines for the laboratory diagnosis of malaria [^115PnbHB]. British Journal of Haematology (2022). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for malaria infection, specifically in laboratory settings, the BSH 2022 guidelines recommend not relying solely on rapid diagnostic tests for malarial antigen instead of microscopy. It is advisable to consider rapid diagnostic tests that utilize nucleic-acid detection methods as supplementary tests, particularly when the diagnosis of malaria is made by relatively inexperienced personnel.

### A diagnostic accuracy study to evaluate standard rapid diagnostic test (RDT) alone to safely rule out imported malaria in children presenting to UK emergency departments [^113MdG4U]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2023). High credibility.

Microscopy is the gold standard for malaria diagnosis but relies on trained personnel. Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) are crucial for diagnosis in endemic areas lacking high-quality microscopy. This study aimed to evaluate whether RDT alone could rule out imported malaria in children presenting to UK emergency departments (EDs).

This was a UK-based, multi-center, retrospective diagnostic accuracy study. It included any child under 16 presenting to the ED with a history of fever and travel to a malaria-endemic country between January 1, 2016, and December 31, 2017. The diagnosis used microscopy for malarial parasites as the clinical reference standard and RDT as the index test. The study received UK Health Research Authority approval: 20/HRA/1341.

- **Results**: There were 47 cases of malaria out of 1,414 eligible cases, with a prevalence of 3.3% in a cohort whose median age was 4 years (IQR 2–9), and 43% were female. Cases of Plasmodium falciparum totaled 36 (77% prevalence, 2.5%). The sensitivity of RDT alone to detect malaria infection due to any Plasmodium species was 93.6% (95% CI 82.5–98.7%), specificity 99.4% (95% CI 98.9–99.7%), positive predictive value 84.6% (95% CI 71.9–93.1%), and negative predictive value 99.8% (95% CI 99.4–100.0%). Sensitivity of RDT to detect P. falciparum infection was 100% (90.3–100%), specificity 98.8% (98.1–99.3%), positive predictive value 69.2% (54.9–81.2%, n = 46/52), and negative predictive value 100% (99.7–100%, n = 1,362/1,362).

- **Conclusions**: RDTs were 100% sensitive in detecting P. falciparum malaria. However, they demonstrated lower sensitivity for other malaria species.

### A novel, sensitive assay for high-throughput molecular detection of plasmodia for active screening of malaria for elimination [^116rVCK4]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2013). Low credibility.

Although malaria remains one of the leading infectious diseases in the world, the decline in malaria transmission in some areas makes it possible to consider the elimination of the disease. As countries approach elimination, malaria diagnosis needs to change from diagnosing ill patients to actively detecting infections in all carriers, including asymptomatic and low-parasite-load patients. However, few of the diagnostic methods have both the throughput and the sensitivity required.

We adopted a sandwich RNA hybridization assay to detect genus Plasmodium 18S rRNA directly from whole-blood samples from Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax patients without RNA isolation. We tested the assay with 202 febrile patients from areas where malaria is endemic, using 20 μl of each blood sample in a 96-well plate format with a 2-day enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-like workflow. The results were compared with diagnoses obtained using microscopy, a rapid diagnostic test (RDT), and genus-specific real-time PCR.

Our assay identified all 66 positive samples diagnosed by microscopy, including 49 poorly stored samples that underwent multiple freeze-thaw cycles due to resource limitation. The assay uncovered three false-negative samples by microscopy and four false-negative samples by RDT and agreed completely with real-time PCR diagnosis. There was no negative sample by our assay that would show a positive result when tested with other methods.

The detection limit of our assay for P. falciparum was 0.04 parasites/μl. The assay's simple workflow, high throughput, and sensitivity make it a valuable tool for malaria screening in elimination efforts.

### Rapid diagnostic tests for diagnosing uncomplicated non-falciparum or Plasmodium vivax malaria in endemic countries [^1128emWi]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Malaria is a life-threatening illness caused by protozoan Plasmodium parasites, which are transmitted by many species of Anopheles mosquitoes. In 2008, there were between 190 and 311 million cases of malaria worldwide [WHO 2009b]. The two most common species of parasites that cause malaria are Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax. Falciparum malaria is the most common cause of severe malaria and malaria deaths, and it can also cause other complications, such as anaemia and, in pregnancy, low birthweight babies. Vivax malaria is a relapsing form, which is rarely fatal but can cause serious anaemia in children. Other, less common, Plasmodium species that cause malaria in people include P. malariae and P. ovale. Malaria is a curable disease; therefore, malaria-related morbidity and mortality can be reduced. Early, prompt, and accurate diagnosis followed by appropriate treatment is key to effective disease management [WHO 2003] and is a basic tenet of malaria control policy [WHO 2005; Bell 2006].

People who are exposed repeatedly to Plasmodium infection develop a partial and incomplete immunity. This means that in highly endemic areas, those most at risk are children under the age of five who have not yet had the chance to develop immunity. In less endemic areas, or areas of seasonal or epidemic transmission, older children and adults are also at risk due to less developed immunity. Travellers from non-endemic to endemic countries are at the highest risk because they have no immunity at all.

### Adding rapid diagnostic tests to community-based programmes for treating malaria [^111vMCSP]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). High credibility.

Selective reporting: We judged all studies at low risk of reporting bias as the publications appear to reflect registered details where available.

- **Other potential sources of bias**: Other biases we considered for cRCTs were recruitment after randomization and contamination. For recruitment after randomization, baseline imbalance was minimal, and we therefore assessed all studies as having some concerns. While few studies mentioned the possibility of contamination, the description of the study sites did not suggest a high risk of bias. The exception was Mubi 2011, where the cross-over design naturally lends itself to more potential for bias. It was also unclear how the significant difference in baseline parasite prevalence between groups in Swana 2016 affected this outcome measurement. Not all studies reported on uptake of the mRDTs.

- **Effects of interventions**: All the studies in this comparison were cRCTs; Mubi 2011 was the only study with a cross-over cluster design.

- **All-cause mortality**: Two studies reported deaths (Ansah 2015; Mubi 2011), although the single death reported in Ansah 2015 actually occurred after the study period. Given the very low number of deaths, and the fact that these data were not adjusted for cluster or cross-over designs, meta-analysis was not possible. We do not know whether community use of mRDTs compared to clinical diagnosis affects mortality. In Mubi 2011, four participants died, including three children under five years old.

### Malaria diagnostic practices in U.S. laboratories in 2017 [^117YDD25]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2018). Low credibility.

In the United States, the gold standard for malaria diagnosis is microscopic blood smear examination. Because malaria is not endemic in the United States, diagnostic capabilities may be limited, causing delays in diagnosis and increased morbidity and mortality. A survey of malaria diagnostic practices in U.S. laboratories was conducted from June to July 2017. Members of the American Society for Microbiology's listserv received a questionnaire inquiring about malaria diagnostic test availability, techniques, and reporting. Results were assessed using the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines for malaria diagnostics. After excluding incomplete and duplicate responses, responses representing 175 laboratories were included.

Most labs (99%) received at least one specimen annually for malaria diagnosis, and 31% reported receiving only 1 to 10 specimens. The majority (74%) diagnosed five or fewer cases of malaria per year. Most (90%) performed blood smears on-site. Two-thirds (70%) provided initial blood smear results within 4 hours. Although diagnostic testing for malaria was available 24/7 at 74% (141) of responding laboratories, only 12% (17) met criteria for analysis and reporting of malaria testing, significantly more than reported in a similar survey in 2010 (3%). The majority of laboratories surveyed had the capability for timely diagnosis of malaria; however, few comply with CLSI guidelines. Inexperience may factor into this noncompliance, as many laboratories see few to no cases of malaria per year.

### Adding rapid diagnostic tests to community-based programmes for treating malaria [^111jXxuP]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). High credibility.

- **Results**: Figure 3 presents the study flow diagram. We retrieved 3,060 records through database searching, and there were 2,080 after removal of duplicates. After screening by title and abstract, we excluded 2,011 records and assessed 69 full-text articles for eligibility. We excluded 61 articles, and one study was ongoing. In this review update, we included seven new studies and one study from the original Cochrane Review (Okwundu 2013).

- **Included studies**: Of the eight included studies, six were conducted in Africa: one in Ghana (Ansah 2015), two in Uganda (Cohen 2015; Ndyomugyenyi 2016), one in Tanzania (Mubi 2011), one in the Democratic Republic of Congo (Swana 2016), and one in Senegal (Thiam 2012). The remaining two studies took place in Afghanistan (Leslie 2017) and Myanmar (Ohnmar 2012). All studies that described the setting indicated that it was rural; however, malaria endemicity and transmission intensities varied.

### Detecting malaria hotspots: A comparison of rapid diagnostic test, microscopy, and polymerase chain reaction [^114EUZiQ]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Malaria control strategies need to respond to geographical hotspots of transmission. Detection of hotspots depends on the sensitivity of the diagnostic tool used.

- **Methods**: We conducted cross-sectional surveys in three sites within Kilifi County, Kenya, that had variable transmission intensities. Rapid diagnostic test (RDT), microscopy, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were used to detect asymptomatic parasitemia, and hotspots were detected using the spatial scan statistic.

- **Results**: Eight thousand five hundred eighty-one study participants were surveyed in three sites. There were statistically significant malaria hotspots by RDT, microscopy, and PCR for all sites except by microscopy in one low transmission site. Pooled data analysis of hotspots by PCR overlapped with hotspots by microscopy at a moderate setting but not at two lower transmission settings. However, variations in the degree of overlap were noted when data were analyzed by year. Hotspots by RDT were predictive of PCR/microscopy at the moderate setting, but not at the two low transmission settings. We observed long-term stability of hotspots by PCR and microscopy but not RDT.

- **Conclusion**: Malaria control programs may consider PCR testing to guide asymptomatic malaria hotspot detection once the prevalence of infection falls.

### Rapid diagnostic tests for Plasmodium vivax malaria in endemic countries [^112wZgrK]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). High credibility.

We assessed the certainty of the evidence for comparisons where there were sufficient studies enabling meta-analyses (i.e. quality of evidence or confidence in effect estimates) using the GRADE approach and GRADEpro Guideline Development Tool software (GRADE 2013; GRADEpro GDT 2015). In the context of a systematic review, the ratings of the certainty of the evidence reflect the extent of our confidence that the estimates of test accuracy are correct. As recommended, we rated the certainty of the evidence as either high (not downgraded), moderate (downgraded by one level), low (downgraded by two levels), or very low (downgraded by more than two levels) for four domains: risk of bias, indirectness, inconsistency, and imprecision. For sensitivity and specificity, the certainty of the evidence initially started as high when there were high-quality cross-sectional or cohort studies that enrolled participants with diagnostic uncertainty.

If we found a reason for downgrading the certainty of the evidence, we classified the reason as either serious (downgraded by one level) or very serious (downgraded by two levels). Three review authors discussed judgments and reached a consensus. We applied GRADE in the following way:

- **Risk of bias**: We used QUADAS-2 to assess risk of bias.
- **Indirectness**: We considered indirectness from the perspective of test accuracy. We used QUADAS-2 to assess applicability concerns and looked for important differences between the populations studied, such as variations in transmission intensity.

### Summary of recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of malaria by the Committee to Advise on Tropical Medicine and Travel (CATMAT) [^115pGdWP]. Canada Communicable Disease Report (2014). High credibility.

Regarding classification and risk stratification for malaria infection, specifically with respect to severity grading, CATMAT 2014 guidelines recommend classifying patients as having severe malaria in the presence of one or more of the following criteria:

- **Prostration/impaired consciousness**: Patients exhibit an inability to sit or stand upright without assistance.
- **Multiple convulsions**: Defined by the occurrence of more than two seizures within 24 hours.
- **Respiratory distress**: Includes labored breathing or rapid breathing.
- **Pulmonary edema**: Fluid accumulation in the lungs, resulting in difficulty breathing.
- **Circulatory collapse**: Indicated by a severe drop in blood pressure or inadequate blood supply to vital organs.
- **Abnormal bleeding**: Any form of spontaneous bleeding not related to trauma or injury.
- **Jaundice**: A visible yellowing of the skin or sclera due to elevated bilirubin levels.
- **Hemoglobinuria**: The presence of hemoglobin in urine, typically a dark or red discoloration.

These criteria help in identifying and managing severe malaria cases appropriately.

### Rapid diagnostic tests versus clinical diagnosis for managing people with fever in malaria endemic settings [^112TetDc]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). High credibility.

The included trials were all conducted in first‐level health facilities in rural areas of Africa, where the majority of malaria cases occur and where RDTs offer the only feasible alternative to presumptive treatment of malaria based on clinical symptoms alone. These trials are from settings with a range of levels of malaria endemicity, and the findings could reasonably be applied to other similar African settings.

The main concern of health workers regarding the use of RDTs is the risk of missing malaria cases and sending children home without antimalarials when the result of the RDT is a false negative. Reassuringly, this review found no difference in patient health outcomes when RDTs are introduced, and the trend is in the direction of benefit. However, only one trial adequately evaluated the risk of false negative results by applying the gold standard light microscopy to all fever patients in both treatment arms, and although the result did not reach statistical significance, the trend was towards higher numbers of missed cases when RDTs were used.

The additional trial from Uganda, which reported decreased RDT sensitivity in the setting with the lowest endemicity, adds to this concern. In this setting, of 404 patients with negative RDTs, 30 (7%) had malaria parasites following microscopy analysis. This risk may be considered too high by some patients and health workers unless adequate measures are taken to ensure the safety of these patients.

### Rapid diagnostic tests versus clinical diagnosis for managing people with fever in malaria endemic settings [^112qE2qv]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). High credibility.

The objective of this study is to evaluate whether introducing rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) into algorithms for diagnosing and treating people with fever improves health outcomes, reduces antimalarial prescribing, and is safe compared to algorithms using clinical diagnosis.

### Performance of ultrasensitive rapid diagnostic tests for detecting asymptomatic [^1124Y9X4]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Low credibility.

Proposed interventions for eliminating drug-resistant Plasmodium falciparum malaria include the targeting of asymptomatic carriers through screening and treatment. We report on the diagnostic performance of the recently developed ultrasensitive rapid diagnostic test (uRDT) compared with screening with conventional RDTs (cRDT) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) under field conditions in Cambodia in a total of 2,729 individuals. The P. falciparum positivity by quantitative PCR (qPCR) was 3.8% (26/678) in those screened during active case detection and 0.5% (10/2,051) in the cross-sectional survey. Compared with qPCR, the sensitivity of the uRDTs was 53.8% (95% CI: 33.4–73.4%) when used in active case detection and 60.0% (95% CI: 26.2–87.8%) in the cross-sectional survey. The uRDTs did not show a significant improvement in diagnostic performance over cRDTs when used for active case detection and for a malaria prevalence survey in the context of this low-transmission setting.
