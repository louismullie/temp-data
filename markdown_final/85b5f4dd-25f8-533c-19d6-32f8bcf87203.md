## Question

calcium pyrophosphate

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease (CPPD). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about definitions and nomenclature to anchor the discussion. Then, I should verify the pathophysiology and why crystals matter. Next, I will classify clinical phenotypes and their frequencies. After that, I need to review epidemiology and risk factors. Then, I will appraise diagnostic strategies, including synovial fluid analysis and imaging. I should also examine special populations and mimics, especially seronegative rheumatoid arthritis. Finally, I will outline management principles, prognosis, and unmet needs, making sure each claim is supported by appropriate citations and that I double-check any assumptions along the way.

> Let me first confirm the foundational definitions so I don't propagate confusion. CPPD is best understood as an umbrella term encompassing both asymptomatic calcium pyrophosphate crystal deposition and symptomatic CPPD disease, with the latter including acute CPP crystal arthritis, chronic CPP crystal inflammatory arthritis, and osteoarthritis with CPPD; chondrocalcinosis refers to cartilage calcification detected by imaging or histology, which is supportive but not itself diagnostic of disease, and I should explicitly distinguish CPP (the crystal) from CPPD (the condition/disease) to avoid mislabeling [^03d6f747] [^ef122b94] [^27e8579c].

> Wait, let me verify the pathophysiology before moving on. The core driver is elevated extracellular inorganic pyrophosphate (ePPi) in cartilage, which promotes CPP crystal formation; these crystals activate the NLRP3 inflammasome, triggering IL-1–mediated inflammation and synovitis, and they also contribute to cartilage degeneration and osteoarthritis phenotypes, though causality remains complex and bidirectional in some contexts [^ebe1d3b5] [^5bc87370] [^f29b980e].

> I will now examine the clinical phenotypes and their relative frequencies, but I should double-check the cohort data. In the large international ACR/EULAR cohort used to develop classification criteria, 97.4% had experienced acute CPP crystal arthritis, 53.7% had recurrent acute episodes, 25.6% had persistent inflammatory arthritis, and 7.3% had crowned dens syndrome; importantly, 29% had overlapping phenotypes, which complicates trial design and phenotype-specific management decisions [^dd7a8e14] [^0a171fa5] [^c8a4c726].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about epidemiology without anchoring to prevalence estimates. Radiographic chondrocalcinosis is common in older adults, with estimates around 7–10% in some series, whereas symptomatic CPPD disease is less frequent but likely underrecognized; CPPD is strongly age-associated and may be the most common inflammatory arthritis in people over 60, with rising prevalence as populations age and imaging sensitivity improves [^8c2b4c37] [^ebe1d3b5] [^39f88793].

> Next, I should review risk factors and modifiers, and I need to ensure I separate modifiable from nonmodifiable drivers. Aging and osteoarthritis are the most consistent associations; metabolic contributors include primary hyperparathyroidism, hemochromatosis, hypomagnesemia, and hypophosphatasia; genetic variants such as ANKH polymorphisms have been implicated; medications like loop/thiazide diuretics and PPIs have been linked in observational data; and prior joint trauma increases risk, with CPPD often reflecting a systemic articular predisposition rather than purely local factors [^ebe1d3b5] [^f7eac25e] [^7a3856a3] [^81661170].

> I should confirm the diagnostic gold standard and its limitations. Synovial fluid analysis by compensated polarized light microscopy remains the definitive test, with CPP crystals appearing as weakly positively birefringent, rhomboid crystals; however, sensitivity is imperfect, availability varies, and crystals may be missed, so imaging and clinical context are essential adjuncts, and I must remember to exclude infection even when crystals are present because sepsis can coexist [^ea1f1d1b] [^09e76bd3] [^e935bc67].

> Let me consider imaging next, and I should verify current guideline positions. Conventional radiography can show chondrocalcinosis and is reasonable first-line, but ultrasound has emerged as a highly sensitive and specific modality for detecting CPP deposits, particularly thin hyperechoic bands in hyaline cartilage and sparkling spots in fibrocartilage; CT is valuable for axial disease such as crowned dens syndrome; MRI helps assess synovitis and structural damage; importantly, 2024 EULAR imaging recommendations advise including both symptomatic sites and knee/wrist in imaging protocols and using ultrasound guidance for aspiration when landmarks are challenging [^5f89d986] [^c39681d6] [^adf51816] [^27e8579c] [^0121a51c].

> But wait, what if the presentation mimics seronegative rheumatoid arthritis; I should double-check the overlap data. Chronic CPP crystal inflammatory arthritis can resemble seronegative RA, and in some cohorts, a substantial fraction of patients initially labeled seronegative RA fulfill CPPD classification criteria; hand OA patterns at the MCP and STT joints, along with wrist involvement and less extensive chondrocalcinosis, are clues that favor CPPD over RA, and careful imaging plus synovial fluid when feasible can resolve the differential [^28fec62f] [^da7afb79] [^713d740a].

> I need to ensure management recommendations align with guidelines and the reality of comorbidities. For acute CPP crystal arthritis, NSAIDs with gastroprotection, low-dose colchicine, and intra-articular corticosteroids are first-line; systemic corticosteroids are alternatives when local injection is not feasible; for prophylaxis of recurrent flares, low-dose colchicine, NSAIDs, or low-dose prednisone are reasonable; for chronic inflammatory CPPD, options include NSAIDs, colchicine, low-dose corticosteroids, methotrexate, or hydroxychloroquine; IL-1 blockade may help refractory cases, though high-quality RCT data are limited; importantly, there is no therapy that reliably dissolves CPP crystals, so control of inflammation is the cornerstone [^739deeb1] [^404cac0f] [^31db1e91] [^45a7cdc6] [^007bc72d] [^ebe1d3b5] [^f313ec69].

> Hold on, I should verify prognosis and long-term outcomes so counseling is accurate. Patients with acute CPP crystal arthritis have higher rates of fracture than matched comparators, with hazard ratios around 1.8 in one large cohort, and CPPD is associated with increased arthroplasty rates, suggesting structural progression in some patients; recurrence is common, with about 24% experiencing flares in one series, and risk factors include cancer, CKD, PPIs, warfarin, and chemotherapy exposure [^38aa1b05] [^03d280c6] [^2fd36e62] [^3cf2481b] [^6b67fb4a].

> I should double-check unmet needs and research directions so I don't overstate certainties. Key gaps include the lack of disease-modifying agents that reduce crystal burden, limited high-quality RCTs for chronic management, inconsistent nomenclature hindering research synthesis, and the need for validated outcome measures and patient-reported flare definitions; recent work on patient-reported acute CPP arthritis definitions and OMERACT-driven imaging consensus are steps forward, but prospective, phenotype-stratified studies are still needed to personalize therapy and clarify causality with osteoarthritis [^f1a8baaf] [^19fc3d66] [^8f9dc7dc] [^ef122b94].

> In summary, I need to ensure the clinical message is coherent: CPPD is a common, heterogeneous crystal deposition disorder with age-related prevalence, multiple inflammatory phenotypes, and substantial diagnostic overlap with OA and seronegative RA; definitive diagnosis relies on synovial fluid crystal identification but is complemented by imaging, especially ultrasound; management is anti-inflammatory and phenotype-tailored, with no proven crystal-dissolving therapy; and patients face increased risks of recurrence, structural progression, and fractures, underscoring the need for vigilance and individualized care plans anchored in current guidelines and evolving evidence [^ebe1d3b5] [^5f89d986] [^38aa1b05].

Calcium pyrophosphate deposition (CPPD) disease is a crystal arthropathy caused by **calcium pyrophosphate crystals** in joints and periarticular tissues, presenting as acute arthritis ("pseudogout"), chronic inflammatory arthritis, or osteoarthritis with chondrocalcinosis [^03d6f747]. Diagnosis relies on **synovial fluid analysis** for CPP crystals and imaging (radiography, ultrasound, or CT) for chondrocalcinosis [^ea1f1d1b] [^5f89d986]. Management is **symptom-focused**: NSAIDs, colchicine, or intra-articular corticosteroids for acute flares, and colchicine, low-dose corticosteroids, methotrexate, or hydroxychloroquine for chronic disease [^739deeb1] [^007bc72d]. There is **no therapy to dissolve crystals**, so prevention targets modifiable risks and comorbidities [^ebe1d3b5] [^7a89cff2].

---

## Pathophysiology

- **Crystal formation**: Elevated extracellular inorganic pyrophosphate (ePPi) drives CPP crystal deposition in cartilage and synovium [^ebe1d3b5].
- **Inflammation**: Crystals activate the NLRP3 inflammasome, causing IL-1–mediated inflammation and synovitis [^ebe1d3b5].
- **Structural damage**: Crystals promote cartilage degeneration and osteoarthritis [^ebe1d3b5].

---

## Clinical manifestations

CPPD has **overlapping phenotypes**:

| **Phenotype** | **Clinical features** |
|-|-|
| Acute CPP crystal arthritis ("pseudogout") | - Rapid onset mono/oligoarthritis <br/> - Knee, wrist, MCPs <br/> - Erythema <br/> - Mimics septic/gout flares [^66b2c643] [^e6e1dffb] |
| Chronic CPP crystal inflammatory arthritis | - Persistent oligo/polyarthritis <br/> - Morning stiffness <br/> - Mimics seronegative RA [^b2e45ffa] [^713d740a] |
| Osteoarthritis with CPPD | - OA with chondrocalcinosis <br/> - More inflammatory symptoms <br/> - Atypical joint distribution (radiocarpal, glenohumeral, hindfoot) [^1e60c07b] [^153e96eb] |
| Crowned dens syndrome | - Acute neck pain <br/> - Systemic inflammation <br/> - CT: calcification of transverse ligament/odontoid [^c8a4c726] [^0dd4839b] |

---

## Risk factors

- **Age**: Strongly associated; prevalence rises with aging [^ebe1d3b5].
- **Osteoarthritis**: Common coexisting condition [^ebe1d3b5].
- **Metabolic disorders**: Hyperparathyroidism, hemochromatosis, hypomagnesemia, hypophosphatasia [^f7eac25e].
- **Genetics**: ANKH and osteoprotegerin variants [^ebe1d3b5].
- **Medications**: Loop/thiazide diuretics, PPIs [^e935bc67] [^81661170].

---

## Diagnosis

Definitive diagnosis requires **synovial fluid analysis** for CPP crystals (weakly positively birefringent, rhomboid) [^ea1f1d1b]. Imaging supports the diagnosis: radiography shows chondrocalcinosis; ultrasound detects linear hyperechoic bands in cartilage; CT identifies axial calcifications (e.g. crowned dens) [^5f89d986] [^27e8579c]. The 2023 ACR/EULAR classification uses a **multidomain score** (clinical, imaging, synovial fluid) [^da7afb79].

---

## Management

### Acute flares

- **NSAIDs**: First-line with gastroprotection [^739deeb1].
- **Colchicine**: 0.5–1 mg/day; effective for flares and prophylaxis [^739deeb1] [^45a7cdc6].
- **Intra-articular corticosteroids**: For severe or refractory flares [^404cac0f].
- **Systemic corticosteroids**: Short taper if local injection not feasible [^31db1e91].

---

### Chronic disease

- **Colchicine**: 0.5–1 mg/day for recurrence prevention [^45a7cdc6].
- **Low-dose corticosteroids**: For persistent symptoms [^007bc72d].
- **Methotrexate or hydroxychloroquine**: For refractory cases [^007bc72d].
- **IL-1 inhibitors**: Anakinra for refractory disease (limited evidence) [^f313ec69].

---

## Prognosis and complications

Recurrence is **common**, and flares often involve new joints [^3cf2481b]. Structural progression includes accelerated OA and increased arthroplasty risk [^2fd36e62]. Extra-articular associations include higher fracture risk and possible cardiovascular links [^38aa1b05] [^03d280c6] [^39f88793].

---

## Current research and unmet needs

- **Crystal dissolution**: No therapy dissolves CPP crystals [^ebe1d3b5].
- **Biomarkers**: Needed for early detection and monitoring [^f1a8baaf].
- **Trials**: Larger RCTs to define optimal chronic therapy [^f1a8baaf].
- **Mechanisms**: Clarify crystal–cartilage interactions and OA links [^f1a8baaf].

---

Calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease is a **common crystal arthropathy** with diverse phenotypes; diagnosis hinges on synovial fluid and imaging, and management is symptom-targeted without crystal-clearing therapy. Ongoing research aims to improve detection, prevention, and disease-modifying strategies [^ebe1d3b5].

Calcium pyrophosphate (CPP) crystal deposition (CPPD) is prevalent and can be associated with synovitis and joint damage. The population of elderly persons predominantly affected by CPPD is growing rapidly. Since shortfalls exist in many aspects of CPPD, we conducted an anonymous survey of CPPD unmet needs, prioritized by experts from the Gout, Hyperuricemia and Crystal-Associated Disease Network. We provide our perspectives on the survey results, and we propose several CPPD basic and clinical translational research pathways. Chondrocyte and cartilage culture systems for generating CPP crystals in vitro and transgenic small animal CPPD models are needed to better define CPPD mechanism paradigms and help guide new therapies. CPPD recognition, clinical research, and care would be improved by international consensus on CPPD nomenclature and disease phenotype classification, better exploitation of advanced imaging, and pragmatic new point-of-care crystal analytic approaches for detecting CPP crystals. Clinical impacts of CPP crystals in osteoarthritis and in asymptomatic joints in elderly persons remain major unanswered questions that are rendered more difficult by current inability to therapeutically limit or dissolve the crystal deposits and assess the consequent clinical outcome. Going forward, CPPD clinical research studies should define clinical settings in which articular CPPD does substantial harm and should include analyses of diverse clinical phenotypes and populations. Clinical trials should identify the best therapeutic targets to limit CPP crystal deposition and associated inflammation and should include assessment of intraarticular agents. Our perspective is that such advances in basic and clinical science in CPPD are now within reach and can lead to better treatments for this disorder.

### Features associated with different inflammatory phenotypes of calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease: a study using data from the international American College of Rheumatology / EULAR calcium pyrophosphate deposition classification criteria cohort [^a6d48fae]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

The study has inherent limitations. First, the cohorts were not designed for epidemiological purposes, and selection and reporting biases may have occurred. The reported people therefore do not reflect the whole population of people with CPPD disease in the community. Because some of these patient profiles were used to develop the CPPD classification criteria, the frequency of particular clinical and imaging findings that are highly weighted in the CPPD classification criteria may be particularly high in this cohort. This limitation may have affected the prevalence of certain phenotypes such as OA and CPPD. Noninflammatory arthritis or mechanical joint pain was not an item collected in the case report form and could only be deduced when all inflammatory features were absent. This cohort represents the largest population of people with CPPD meeting the ACR/EULAR CPPD classification criteria. Another limitation is that the investigators did not receive any specific training to standardize readings of imaging techniques, and no centralized reading was organized, which may have induced a variability in reporting the presence of chondrocalcinosis, particularly with advanced techniques such as ultrasound, which is operator dependent. The consensus definitions of imaging evidence of CPP crystal deposition, however, demonstrated good performance characteristics for conventional radiography. Finally, only a preselected group of clinical, imaging, and laboratory variables were collected on these participants, which precludes the identification of a broader range of associations with clinical phenotypes.

This large international cohort, which informed and validated the 2023 ACR/EULAR classification criteria for CPPD disease, provides new insights into the clinical phenotypes encompassed by the disease. Clinical phenotypes overlapped, underscoring the importance of considering how to assess outcomes in future clinical trials that may enroll people with more than one manifestation. Future studies looking into the genetics of the disease, still only superficially explored, should take into account the heterogeneity and specific clinical associations to better understand the pathophysiology of the disease. Clinical trials in CPPD disease will also need to take this heterogeneity of phenotypes into account since some treatments and outcome measures will certainly be more appropriate for some phenotypes than others.

INTRODUCTION

Calcium pyrophosphate deposition (CPPD) disease occurs as a consequence of the pathological presence of calcium pyrophosphate (CPP) crystals inside joints. It is an umbrella term comprising different acute and chronic phenotypes, which often coexist. Acute CPP crystal arthritis presents with severe joint pain and swelling, like gout flares, commonly affecting knees, wrists, and ankles and lasting for several days to weeks. These episodes can be recurrent. A specific phenotype of CPPD disease is crowned dens syndrome (CDS), characterized by acute neck pain, elevated markers of systemic inflammation, and imaging evidence of calcification on computed tomography (CT). Chronic CPP crystal inflammatory arthritis can present with persistent mono, oligo, or polyarthritis. The relative distribution and the clinical characteristics associated with these different phenotypes are not well understood. A recent international initiative led to the development and validation of the American College of Rheumatology (ACR)/EULAR classification criteria of CPPD disease in 2023. 5,7,14 Given the relative paucity of literature on the different presentations of CPPD disease, the objectives of this study were to describe the distribution of the main inflammatory phenotypes of CPPD disease in this cohort and to explore the commonalities and differences in demographic, clinical, and imaging features associated across the different CPPD presentations.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease, more specifically with respect to clinical presentation, EULAR 2011 guidelines recommend to recognize that chronic calcium pyrophosphate crystal inflammatory arthritis presents as chronic oligoarthritis or polyarthritis with inflammatory symptoms and signs and occasional systemic upset (with elevated CRP and ESR). Recognize that superimposed flares with characteristics of crystal inflammation support this diagnosis.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease, more specifically with respect to clinical presentation, EULAR 2011 guidelines recommend to suspect acute crystal inflammation if there is rapid development of severe joint pain, swelling and tenderness reaching its maximum within 6–24 hours, especially with overlying erythema. However, this is not specific for acute calcium pyrophosphate crystal arthritis.

### Calcium pyrophosphate crystal deposition: 2025 update to recent epidemiological findings [^39f88793]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Our objective is to propose an expert opinion focusing on most important and recent developments in calcium pyrophosphate deposition (CPPD) epidemiology. We highlight recent findings published in the past 18months and their potential implications for research and patient care.

Recent Findings

We discuss new understanding of CPPD prevalence through advances in imaging modalities, advances in synovial fluid analyses (SFA), updates on disease phenotypes, and potential sources of misdiagnosis of CPPD. We present recent data regarding extra-articular associations of CPPD, particularly cardiovascular events and osteoporotic fractures. We discuss new therapeutic options. We identify barriers to improving research in CPPD, and tools currently available to overcome certain pitfalls.

Summary

Improved knowledge in the epidemiology of asymptomatic CPPD and symptomatic CPPD disease is crucial to improving recognition of this still underdiagnosed disease, and to understanding patient phenotypes and their outcomes. Future research will require prospective designs to establish the prevalence of CPPD disease phenotypes and to provide more precise data according to each phenotype, both in terms of epidemiological findings and treatment responses, to develop personalized medicine.

### Fractures in patients with acute calcium pyrophosphate crystal arthritis versus matched comparators in a large cohort study [^38aa1b05]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

Calcium pyrophosphate deposition (CPPD) disease was associated with osteopenia in two cross-sectional studies. We compared fracture risks in patients with acute calcium pyrophosphate (CPP) crystal arthritis versus matched comparators.

Methods

We performed a longitudinal cohort study using electronic health record data from a single large academic health system, with data from 1991 to 2023. Patients with one or more episodes of acute CPP crystal arthritis were matched to comparators on the index date (first documentation of "pseudogout" or synovial fluid CPP crystals or matched encounter) and first encounter in the health system. The primary outcome was first fracture at the humerus, wrist, hip, or pelvis. We excluded patients with fracture before the index date. Covariates included demographics, body mass index, smoking, comorbidities, health care use, glucocorticoids, and osteoporosis treatments. We estimated incidence rates and adjusted hazard ratios for fracture. Sensitivity analyses excluded patients prescribed glucocorticoids, patients prescribed osteoporosis treatments, or patients with rheumatoid arthritis and additionally adjusted for chronic kidney disease.

Results

We identified 1,148 patients with acute CPP crystal arthritis matched to 3,730 comparators, with a mean age of 73years. Glucocorticoids and osteoporosis treatments were more frequent in the acute CPP crystal arthritis cohort. Fracture incidence rates were twice as high in the acute CPP crystal arthritis cohort (11.7 per 1,000 person-years) versus comparators (5.5 per 1,000 person-years). After multivariable adjustment, fracture relative risk was twice as high in the acute CPP crystal arthritis cohort (hazard ratio 1.8 [95% confidence interval 1.3–2.3]); results were similar in sensitivity analyses.

Conclusion

In this first published study of fractures and CPPD, fracture risk was nearly doubled in patients with acute CPP crystal arthritis.

### Features associated with different inflammatory phenotypes of calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease: a study using data from the international American College of Rheumatology / EULAR calcium pyrophosphate deposition classification criteria cohort [^0a171fa5]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

The study objective was to examine the disease, demographic, and imaging features associated with different inflammatory phenotypes of calcium pyrophosphate deposition (CPPD) disease, ie, recurrent acute calcium pyrophosphate (CPP) crystal arthritis, chronic CPP crystal inflammatory arthritis, and crowned dens syndrome (CDS).

Methods

Data from an international cohort (assembled from 25 sites in 7 countries for the development and validation of the 2023 CPPD classification criteria from the American College of Rheumatology/EULAR) that met the criteria were included. Three cross-sectional studies were conducted to determine the phenotypic characteristics of recurrent acute CPP crystal arthritis, chronic CPP crystal inflammatory arthritis, and CDS. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to calculate adjusted odds ratio (aOR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) to examine the association between potential risk factors and the inflammatory phenotype.

Results

Among the 618 people included (56% female; mean age [standard deviation] 74.0 [11.9] years), 602 (97.4%) had experienced acute CPP crystal arthritis, 332 (53.7%) had recurrent acute arthritis, 158 (25.6%) had persistent inflammatory arthritis, and 45 (7.3%) had had CDS. Recurrent acute CPP crystal arthritis associated with longer disease duration (aOR 2.88 [95% CI 2.00–4.14]). Chronic CPP crystal inflammatory arthritis was associated with acute wrist arthritis (aOR 2.92 [95% CI 1.81–4.73]), metacarpophalangeal joint osteoarthritis (aOR 1.87 [95% CI 1.17–2.97]), and scapho-trapezo-trapezoid (STT) joint osteoarthritis (aOR 1.83 [95% CI 1.15–2.91]), and it was negatively associated with either metabolic or familial risk for CPPD (aOR 0.60 [95% CI 0.37–0.96]). CDS was associated with male sex (aOR 2.35 [95% CI 1.21–4.59]), STT joint osteoarthritis (aOR 2.71 [95% CI 1.22–6.05]), and more joints affected with chondrocalcinosis (aOR 1.46 [95% CI 1.15–1.85]).

Conclusion

CPPD disease encompasses acute and chronic inflammatory phenotypes, each with specific clinical and imaging features that need to be considered in the diagnostic workup.

### Features associated with different inflammatory phenotypes of calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease: a study using data from the international American College of Rheumatology / EULAR calcium pyrophosphate deposition classification criteria cohort [^713d740a]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Two prior, single‐center cohort studies reported that recurrent flares occurred in approximately 25% of people with an initial episode of acute CPP crystal arthritis. In those cohort studies, cancer/chemotherapy and chronic kidney disease were significantly associated with recurrent flares. Our prevalence of recurrent flares was double that of the prior studies, which may be explained by the way the current cohort was assembled; experts were asked to provide deidentified patient profiles of those with a high probability of having CPPD disease, which may have created selection bias favoring people with more severe or extreme phenotypes of CPPD disease. We also found an association of recurrent acute CPP crystal arthritis with longer disease duration, which was expected because more time after the first flare allows for greater opportunity of recurrent episodes to be experienced.

Approximatively a quarter of people experiencing acute CPP crystal arthritis had chronic CPP crystal inflammatory arthritis (commonly mistaken for seronegative rheumatoid arthritis). Isolated persistent inflammatory arthritis was an uncommon finding in this cohort, potentially reflecting that this phenotype of CPPD disease is underrecognized in the absence of a previous acute episode, or that acute flares are also common in those with the chronic inflammatory phenotype, a possibility that is plausible on theoretical grounds. However, this needs to be evaluated in future studies. A previous study from a large German tertiary center showed that one‐third of people identified as having seronegative rheumatoid arthritis (RA; ie, being negative for the rheumatoid factor and anti‐citrullinated protein anitbodies) were eventually diagnosed with CPPD disease with a "pseudo‐RA" phenotype. In a European cohort of 129 people with chronic symptoms of CPPD disease recruited in referral centers for CPPD disease, the persistent CPP crystal arthritis phenotype was as frequent as the recurrent acute CPP crystal arthritis phenotype. In our study, the persistent CPP crystal arthritis phenotype was associated with radiographic OA in particular hand joints. Specifically, it was associated with OA in the second or third MCP joints and/or the STT joint in best adjusted models. The associations with these specific sites of structural damage were also noted in the German study, and they were more prevalent than in seropositive RA. Persistent CPP crystal arthritis was commonly associated with acute wrist arthritis, which may further explain why this phenotype is commonly misdiagnosed for RA, as such episodes could resemble RA flares. From a diagnostic perspective, these unusual features of hand OA are particularly suggestive of the diagnosis of CPPD disease, especially as people with the persistent CPP crystal arthritis phenotype did not exhibit extensive chondrocalcinosis compared to the other phenotypes. Known metabolic conditions involved in CPPD disease include primary hyperparathyroidism, hereditary haemochromatosis, hypomagnesemia (in particular due to renal magnesium wasting such as in Gitelman disease), familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia, and hypophosphatasia. They often cause extensive CPPD through enhanced CPP crystal formation. Hereditary causes are associated with early and severe cases of familial CPPD disease and are linked to ANKH (and ATP transporter) and osteoprotegerin polymorphisms. In our cohorts, persistent CPP crystal arthritis was negatively associated with known metabolic or genetic (familial) risk factors for CPPD disease, suggesting that these conditions are more commonly responsible for episodes of acute arthritis.

### Calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease [^ebe1d3b5]. The Lancet: Rheumatology (2024). High credibility.

Calcium pyrophosphate deposition (CPPD) disease is a consequence of the immune response to the pathological presence of calcium pyrophosphate (CPP) crystals inside joints, which causes acute or chronic inflammatory arthritis. CPPD is strongly associated with cartilage degradation and osteoarthritis, although the direction of causality is unclear. This clinical presentation is called CPPD with osteoarthritis. Although direct evidence is scarce, CPPD disease might be the most common cause of inflammatory arthritis in older people (aged > 60 years). CPPD is caused by elevated extracellular-pyrophosphate concentrations in the cartilage and causes inflammation by activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Common risk factors for CPPD disease include ageing and previous joint injury. It is uncommonly associated with metabolic conditions (eg, hyperparathyroidism, haemochromatosis, hypomagnesaemia, and hypophosphatasia) and genetic variants (eg, in the ANKH and osteoprotegerin genes). Apart from the detection of CPP crystals in synovial fluid, imaging evidence of CPPD in joints by mainly conventional radiography, and increasingly ultrasonography, has a central role in the diagnosis of CPPD disease. CT is useful in showing calcification in axial joints such as in patients with crowned dens syndrome. To date, no treatment is effective in dissolving CPP crystals, which explains why control of inflammation is currently the main focus of therapeutic strategies. Prednisone might provide the best benefit-risk ratio for the treatment of acute CPP-crystal arthritis, but low-dose colchicine is also effective with a risk of mild diarrhoea. Limited evidence suggests that colchicine, low-dose weekly methotrexate, and hydroxychloroquine might be effective in the prophylaxis of recurrent flares and in the management of persistent CPP-crystal inflammatory arthritis. Additionally, biologics inhibiting IL-1 and IL-6 might have a role in the management of refractory disease.

Purpose Of Review

Calcium pyrophosphate (CPP) crystal disease is a common rheumatologic disorder that has received limited attention from the scientific community. This review is aimed at summarizing current evidence for managing CPP disease (CPPD), focusing on recently reported advances.

Recent Findings

New data from case series indicate that interleukin-1β inhibitors can help patients with refractory forms of CPPD. Methotrexate, formerly a promising agent, failed to demonstrate benefits in a recent trial, but still merits consideration for some patients. No significant advances on crystal dissolution have been achieved to date. Proper characterization of the CPP crystal disease picture is needed, ruling out the possible coexistence of another persistent arthritis unrelated to the CPP deposition.

Summary

Advances on CPP crystal dissolution and establishing definitions of the clinical spectrum of CPPD remain the main challenges for CPP crystal disease management.

### How can ultrasonography help in the management of CPPD? From diagnosis to clinical subset identification [^29b7700d]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Clinical manifestations of calcium pyrophosphate deposition (CPPD) disease are quite heterogeneous, ranging from asymptomatic presentation to severe forms of arthritis. In recent years, imaging, particularly ultrasound (US) has gained a central role for the diagnosis of CPPD. However, many questions are still open. Aim of this review is to present how US could be a key tool in the diagnosis and assessment of CPPD and for the identification of subsets of the disease.

Recent Findings

awareness and research interest around CPPD is increasing in the recent years, as several international taskforces are working on the validation of outcome measures and classification criteria for CPPD, but many pieces of the puzzle are still missing. Recent studies demonstrated that CPPD is an underdiagnosed disease, frequently misdiagnosed as rheumatoid arthritis or polymyalgia rheumatica. US has been increasingly used in the past decade for the diagnosis of CPPD and US definitions have been validated by the OMERACT US working group in the recent years, making of US a valuable tool for diagnosis.

Summary

The most challenging aspects of CPPD are the differential diagnosis with other form of arthritis of the elderly, and the classification of patients in clinical subsets. In this review, we will present the available data for the use of US in the diagnosis of CPPD and we will provide a mainly experienced-based approach to the potential role of the technique in differential diagnosis and phenotypization of patients.

### Calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease is associated with increased risk of fractures: a retrospective cohort study using electronic health record data [^03d280c6]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the risk of fractures in older adults with calcium pyrophosphate deposition (CPPD) disease and osteoarthritis (OA) compared to those with OA alone, and to assess site- and gender-specific fracture risk.

Methods

Using predominantly North American electronic health record data from 2005–2025, we defined CPPD as patients aged ≥ 60 years with ≥ 2 administrative codes for CPPD plus OA, excluding other inflammatory arthritides. Comparators were defined analogously with ≥ 2 OA codes but without CPPD. The primary outcome was any fracture of spine, upper limb, lower limb. We used Cox proportional hazards models 1:1 propensity score-matched for demographics, comorbidities, and medications. Subgroup analyses assessed gender-specific outcomes and site-specific fractures. Sensitivity analyses excluded individuals with prior exposure to glucocorticoids or anti-osteoporosis medications or prior fracture history.

Results

Among 20,176 matched pairs (mean age 73 years, 59% female) with 4015 and 3349 fracture events over 81,291 and 85,802 patient-years, CPPD was associated with 29% increased hazard of any fracture (HR 1.29, 95%CI 1.23, 1.35) which was consistent in males (HR 1.36, 95%CI 1.23, 1.49) and females (HR 1.30, 95%CI 1.23, 1.38). Site-specific analyses similarly showed elevated fracture risks at the upper limb (HR 1.37; 1.28, 1.46), lower limb (HR 1.31; 1.23, 1.39), and spine (HR 1.18; 1.11, 1.26). Results were similar across all sensitivity analyses.

Conclusion

CPPD disease is associated with increased fracture risk across gender and fracture sites. Clinicians should consider screening for bone health in these patients. Future research should clarify underlying mechanisms and refine targeted interventions.

### Systematic review and quality analysis of emerging diagnostic measures for calcium pyrophosphate crystal deposition disease [^e935bc67]. RMD Open (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate crystal deposition (CPPD) in the extracellular matrix of articular hyaline and fibrocartilages, and of certain articular and periarticular connective tissues is very common as an idiopathic disorder in ageing.CPPD also can occur in association with osteoarthritis (OA), certain metabolic disorders (including hyperparathyroidism, haemochromatosis, hypomagnesaemia), and as a heritable disorder, whose common thread may be excessive cartilage extracellular inorganic pyrophosphate (PP i). Contributing factors to the disorder include PP i generation and transport, imbalances in chondrocyte growth factors, and alterations in the connective tissue matrix.

CPPD manifests substantially more often as joint pathology than it does as a symptomatic arthropathy. Recent epidemiological studies suggest growing CPPD prevalence in developed countries, not simply due to increased longevity of the population and particularly high prevalence of OA, but also potentially promoted by iatrogenic factors; these factors include hypomagnesaemia associated with loop and thiazide diuretics and proton pump inhibitors. The original diagnostic criteria for CPPD were proposed by McCartyin 1994. European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) recommendations for diagnosis in 2011 reinforced these criteria, including that the gold standard for diagnosis of CPPD crystal deposition disease, particularly for acute CPP crystal-associated inflammatory arthritis, is identification of CPPD crystals by compensated polarised light microscopic analysis of synovial fluid, in the absence of joint infection or other cause of arthritis. EULAR also seminally highlighted evidence on the utility of ultrasound (U/S) in CPPD diagnosis in 2011. As U/S and other CPPD diagnostic modalities are rapidly emerging since 2011, we systematically reviewed the literature on the diagnostic approach modalities, including the conventional standard of plain radiography. We examined new evidence on high-resolution U/S, dual-energy CT (DECT) and specialised crystal analytic approaches such as Raman spectroscopy. To bring focus onto the most recent developments in CPPD diagnosis, we used the 2011 EULAR systematic review as a starting point, and simply updated 2009–2016 literature findings not cited in 2011 by EULAR. We also performed evidence grading, and assessed unmet needs in the field.

### Development and internal-external cross-validation of a patient-reported definition for acute calcium pyrophosphate crystal arthritis [^19fc3d66]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In recent years, calcium pyrophosphate (CPP) deposition (CPPD) disease has stepped out from the margins of medical research. In 2022, the first consensus-based definitions for imaging features of CPPD were published. In 2023, an American College of Rheumatology (ACR)/European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology (EULAR) task force developed and validated the first classification criteria for CPPD disease. Acute CPP crystal arthritis is by far the most well recognized phenotype of CPPD disease. It was the most prevalent clinical presentation reported in the international cohort of patients assembled to develop and validate the ACR/EULAR classification criteria for CPPD disease. A quarter of patients experienced recurrent episodes of acute CPP crystal inflammatory arthritis during a mean follow-up of 5 years.

Although interventional and observational studies have evaluated the short-term efficacy of different drugs in acute CPP crystal arthritis, there is no high-quality evidence evaluating their effectiveness in preventing recurrences.

One of the issues hampering further research in this field is the lack of validated definitions for clinical states in CPPD disease and monitoring treatment responses. Research in gout faced a similar issue before the development of patient-reported definitions for gout flares in 2012. These definitions have been used in several observation studies and clinical trials to enable a standardized assessment of gout flares.

The diagnosis of acute CPP crystal arthritis can be even more challenging than that of gout flares, and a reliable self-report definition of flares is needed to support future trials and observational research in the field. Therefore, we aimed to develop and validate a patient-reported definition of acute CPP crystal arthritis. The development of a definition for acute CPP crystal arthritis may be the first step to create a broader set of response/remission criteria for CPPD disease.

Arthritis & Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

This is the first study to evaluate the clinical, imaging, and demographic factors associated with different inflammatory phenotypes of CPPD disease in a set of people who met the 2023 ACR/EULAR classification criteria for CPPD disease. The most frequent inflammatory phenotype was acute CPP crystal arthritis, which was recurrent in half of the cases. Recurrence was associated with increasing disease duration. A quarter also experienced persistent CPP crystal inflammatory arthritis, usually at a younger age, and this phenotype was associated with a history of acute wrist arthritis and radiographic features of OA in the second or third MCP and/or STT joint. CDS was an uncommon phenotype, rarely occurred as the sole manifestation, and was associated with more extensive chondrocalcinosis in peripheral joints as well as hand OA in specific joints. There were very few participants with CPPD and OA alone potentially due to hospital‐based recruitment resulting in selection bias.

Study design

The prevalence of acute CPP crystal arthritis, recurrent acute crystal arthritis, persistent CPP inflammatory arthritis, and CDS were explored.

Cross‐sectional study to describe the prevalence of different inflammatory phenotypes of CPPD
Nested cross‐sectional studies examining the characteristics of inflammatory phenotypes of interest

Three separate nested cross‐sectional studies were conducted. The first nested study compared the aforementioned features for people with recurrent acute inflammatory CPP crystal arthritis (time to maximal pain < 24 hours of any joint) compared to those participants with only a single inflammatory episode. The second nested cross‐sectional study examined the features for people with persistent inflammatory CPP crystal arthritis versus those without persistent symptoms. The third nested cross‐sectional study examined the features associated with CDS in people with versus without crowned dens.

Statistical analysis

The prevalence and 95% confidence interval (CI) of acute CPP crystal arthritis, recurrent acute crystal arthritis, persistent CPP inflammatory arthritis, and CDS were calculated. Next, we evaluated the association of clinical features, imaging findings, and metabolic/familial predispositions with each of these three phenotypes using multivariable logistic regression, with adjustment for current age (years) and sex (model 1) and for all covariates (current age [years], gender, symptom duration [> 2 or ≤ 2 years], acute knee arthritis [yes/no], acute wrist arthritis [yes/no], number of acute episodes of acute arthritis [0, 1, or > 1], CDS [yes/no], metabolic or family history of CPPD [yes/no], radiographic MCP joint OA [yes/no], radiographic STT joint OA [yes/no], radiographic wrist OA [yes/no], SLAC wrist [yes/no], and number of joints with chondrocalcinosis) (model 2) in separate models. Unadjusted odds ratios (ORs) and adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and their 95% CIs were calculated. Statistical significance was set at P < 0.05. Statistics were performed using Stata software version MP.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease, more specifically with respect to clinical presentation, EULAR 2011 guidelines recommend to recognize that compared to osteoarthritis without CPPD, osteoarthritis with CPPD may associate with:

- more inflammatory symptoms and signs

- atypical distribution (such as radiocarpal or midcarpal, glenohumeral, hindfoot or midfoot involvement)

- prominent cyst and osteophyte formation on radiographs.

### Calcium crystal deposition diseases-beyond gout [^5bc87370]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2018). Medium credibility.

The most common types of calcium-containing crystals that are associated with joint and periarticular disorders are calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPP) and basic calcium phosphate (BCP) crystals. Several diverse but difficult-to-treat acute and chronic arthropathies and other clinical syndromes are associated with the deposition of these crystals. Although the pathogenic mechanism of calcium crystal deposition is partially understood, much remains to be investigated, as no drug is available to prevent crystal deposition, permit crystal dissolution or specifically target the pathogenic effects that result in the clinical manifestations. In this Review, the main clinical manifestations of CPP and BCP crystal deposition are discussed, along with the biological effects of these crystals, current therapeutic approaches and future directions in therapy.

### Epidemiology of calcium pyrophosphate crystal arthritis and basic calcium phosphate crystal arthropathy [^8dbee961]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Calcium pyrophosphate crystal deposition (CPPD) is common and mainly associates with increasing age and osteoarthritis (OA). Recent studies suggest that CPPD occurs as the result of a generalized articular predisposition and may also associate with low cortical bone mineral density. The epidemiology of basic calcium phosphate (BCP) crystal deposition is poorly understood. Although periarticular BCP crystal deposits occurs at all ages and in both sexes, intra-articular BCP crystal deposition tends to associate with increasing age and OA. Calcium pyrophosphate and BCP crystals frequently coexist in joints with OA.

RESULTS

Participants

Data for 1,020 participants with different rheumatic musculoskeletal diseases were collected. Among them, 618 fulfilled the ACR/EULAR CPPD classification criteria for CPPD disease and were included in this study. Among them 56% were female, and their mean age was 74.0 (standard deviation 11.9) years (Table 1). Nearly all participants had at least one flare of acute CPP crystal arthritis (97.4% [n = 602] [95% CI 95.8%–98.5%]), whereas persistent CPP crystal inflammatory arthritis was less common (25.6% [n = 158] [95% CI 22.2%–29.2%]), and CDS (7.3% [n = 45] [95% CI 5.4%–9.6%]) was the least common. Of the 602 people with acute CPP crystal arthritis, 332 (55.1%) experienced a recurrent flare. Only 9 participants did not have any inflammatory manifestation (1.4% [95% CI 0.7%–2.7%]). Twenty‐nine percent had features of two or more inflammatory phenotypes (Figure 1). CDS was almost always associated with other inflammatory phenotypes, with CDS being the sole manifestation in only 3 participants. There 6 six people with familial history of CPPD disease (1 with persistent inflammatory arthritis, 1 with persistent inflammatory arthritis and recurrent flares, and 4 with recurrent flares) and 8 people with haemochromatosis (6 with acute arthritis alone and 2 with both acute inflammatory arthritis and persistent inflammatory arthritis). There were 72 people with primary hyperparathyroidism or hypercalcemia (2 without inflammatory symptoms, 1 with CDS and acute inflammatory arthritis and persistent inflammatory arthritis, 1 with CDS and acute inflammatory arthritis, 2 with CDS alone, 10 with acute inflammatory arthritis and persistent inflammatory arthritis, and 56 with acute inflammatory arthritis alone), there were 31 with hypomagnesemia alone (19 with acute inflammatory arthritis alone, 9 with acute inflammatory arthritis and persistent inflammatory arthritis, 2 with CDS and acute inflammatory arthritis, and 1 with CDS and persistent inflammatory arthritis and acute inflammatory arthritis), and there were 15 with both hypercalcemia and hypomagnesemia (14 with acute inflammatory arthritis alone and 1 with persistent inflammatory arthritis and acute inflammatory arthritis).

### Update on calcium pyrophosphate deposition [^fc3b5d7b]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2016). Low credibility.

Calcium pyrophosphate crystal deposition (CPPD) associates with ageing, osteoarthritis (OA), uncommon metabolic diseases, mutations and polymorphisms in the ankylosis human gene (ANKH). CPPD is frequently polyarticular, occurs due to a generalised articular predisposition, and the association between CPPD and OA is joint specific, for example CPPD associates with knee OA, but not with hip OA. Other recently identified associations include knee malalignment (knee CC), low cortical BMD and soft-tissue calcification. CPPD is generally asymptomatic. A recent study reported that knees with OA plus CC at the index joint, or at distant joints (in absence of index joint CC), were more likely to have attrition. CPPD can cause acute CPP crystal arthritis, chronic CPP crystal inflammatory arthritis, and is frequently present in joints with OA. Joint aspiration remains the gold standard for diagnosing CPPD, although other promising techniques are emerging. Patients with polyarticular or young onset CPPD should be screened for underlying metabolic abnormalities, however, such testing can be unrewarding. The treatment of CPPD is symptomatic. Acute CPP crystal arthritis is treated with rest, local application of ice-packs, joint aspiration, colchicine and/or intra-articular corticosteroid injection (once infection is excluded). Colchicine, low-dose corticosteroids, hydroxychloroquine and radiosynovectomy are recommended for the treatment of chronic or recurrent acute CPP crystal arthritis. Recent RCTs did not confirm any benefit from methotrexate, and although there is increasing interest in the use of anti-IL1 agents for acute or chronic CPP crystal arthritis, their efficacy has not been formally examined. Unlike gout, currently there are no treatments to eliminate CPP crystal deposits.

Discussion

CPPD is one of the most challenging conditions to assess as the presence of CPP deposition may be associated (or in overlap?) with other arthropathies, making symptom attribution difficult and final diagnosis fallible. The increasing importance of CPPD, particularly in the setting of the ageing population, makes it necessary to establish international consensus on CPPD nomenclature, as a preliminary step to improve research on this field. The results of this SLR further pinpoint how far we are from consistent terminology in CPPD, as over the last two decades the terminology used in the literature is extremely varied, and same labels often refer to different concepts.

The condition's label constitutes one of the most striking controversies. Indeed, its designations as 'chondrocalcinosis' (ie, radiographic deposits) or 'pseudogout' (ie, former term for acute arthritis due to CPPD), have been widely used, whereas the last recognised umbrella term in the EULAR recommendations is 'calcium pyrophosphate deposition' (the current term for all clinical phenotypes of CPPD). The other major confusion concerns the recognition of CPPD as a deposition (covering asymptomatic and symptomatic forms) or as a disease (only symptomatic forms). This confusion is revealed through letter 'D' of the 'CPPD' abbreviation meaning — that sometimes stands for 'deposition' and sometimes for 'disease'. For this reason in this SLR, we decided to adopt the term 'CPPD condition' to refer to all aspects of CPPD (asymptomatic and symptomatic) and to use 'CPPD disease' to refer only to the symptomatic form. A way to avoid confusion and inaccuracies in the literature should agree on a label for the asymptomatic form, because the asymptomatic form is often included under the terminology 'CPPD disease'. Finally, there was also a marked confusion with the abbreviation 'CPPD' that designate either the condition and the crystal, whereas the admitted crystal abbreviation is 'CPP' for 'calcium pyrophosphate'. Regarding crystal labels, confusion has been made in the literature on the use of dihydrate and dehydrate for the name of the crystal: dehydrate is a wording error, and dihydrate is the correct name of the chemical compound according to the PubChem library.

### Calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease: a review of epidemiologic findings [^7a3856a3]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The purpose of this review is to summarize the recent advances in the epidemiology of calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease (CPPD), and to discuss their implications. This review is particularly timely as several epidemiological studies that enhance the understanding of CPPD have been published recently.

Recent Findings

This article will review recent findings on the prevalence of chondrocalcinosis; discuss new data on the associations between bone mineral density and chondrocalcinosis; and between diuretic use, chronic kidney disease 5 and 'pseudogout' (now termed acute calcium pyrophosphate crystal arthritis). It will summarize findings from a large dataset which reported that chondrocalcinosis results from a systemic predisposition, and that the association between chondrocalcinosis and polymorphisms in ANKH gene is independent of age and osteoarthritis. It will also review recent data which suggest that the association between chondrocalcinosis and osteoarthritis may be joint specific, and that chondrocalcinosis associates with radiographic attrition in knees with osteoarthritis.

Summary

The studies reviewed suggest that CPPD occurs due to a generalized predisposition, and that it modifies the radiographic phenotype of osteoarthritis. However, further research is required to confirm if CPPD modifies the clinical phenotype of osteoarthritis.

### Confirming prior and identifying novel correlates of acute calcium pyrophosphate crystal arthritis [^81661170]. Arthritis Care & Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

To investigate previously identified and novel correlates of acute calcium pyrophosphate (CPP) crystal arthritis among well-characterized cases.

Methods

In this case-control study, we identified cases of acute CPP crystal arthritis using a validated algorithm (positive predictive value 81%) applied in the Partners HealthCare electronic health record (EHR). Cases were matched to general patient controls on the year of first EHR encounter and index date. Prespecified potential correlates included sex, race, and comorbidities and medications previously associated with CPP deposition/acute CPP crystal arthritis in the literature. We estimated odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals using conditional logistic regression models adjusted for demographic characteristics, comorbidities, medications prescribed in the past 90days, health care utilization, and multimorbidity score.

Results

We identified 1,697 cases matched to 6,503 controls. Mean ± SD age was 73.7 ± 11.8years, 56.7% were female, 80.8% were White, and 10.3% were Black. All prespecified covariates were more common in cases than controls. Osteoarthritis (OR 3.08), male sex (OR 1.35), rheumatoid arthritis (OR 2.09), gout (OR 2.83), proton pump inhibitors (OR 1.94), loop diuretics (OR 1.60), and thiazides (OR 1.46) were significantly associated with acute CPP crystal arthritis after full adjustment. Black race was associated with lower odds for acute CPP crystal arthritis compared to White race (OR 0.47).

Conclusion

Using a validated algorithm to identify nearly 1,700 patients with acute CPP crystal arthritis, we confirmed important correlates of this acute manifestation of CPP deposition. This is the first study to report higher odds for acute CPP crystal arthritis among males.

Among all the included articles, 266/886 (30.0%) provided a definition for the pathogenic condition. Available definitions were globally mentioning a probable high frequency of CPPD in the elderly, caused by intra-articular and periarticular deposition of calcium pyrophosphate crystals and characterised by heterogeneous presentations. Those sometimes included a list of clinically relevant phenotypes for the condition, like asymptomatic, acute, subacute and chronic forms.

In 405/886 (45.7%) of the included articles, 'CPPD' was used to describe the deposition (both symptomatic and asymptomatic), and in 143/886 (16.1%), 'CPPD' was used to describe symptomatic disease. Those results are detailed in online supplemental table S4.

METHODS

Participants

Rheumatologists from 25 sites in 7 countries (France, Italy, Ireland, New Zealand, The Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and the United States) submitted deidentified participant profiles for the development of the 2023 ACR/EULAR criteria. Participants were identified retrospectively by investigators using patient lists, with investigators filling in the data collection forms through a review of patient medical records or prospectively during face‐to‐face or remote clinic visits during the data collection period, which occurred during the COVID‐19 pandemic. Data collection occurred between June 2020 and November 2021. The details of this study have been published elsewhere. The study was approved by the Health Research Authority (Research Ethics Committee reference/SC/0243) and the local ethics committees at each participating site as appropriate. People with asymptomatic CPPD were ineligible.

### Acute calcium pyrophosphate crystal arthritis is associated with an increased rate of hip and knee joint surgery [^2fd36e62]. Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

Acute calcium pyrophosphate (CPP) crystal arthritis is a distinct manifestation of calcium pyrophosphate crystal deposition (CPPD). No studies have specifically examined whether acute CPP crystal arthritis is associated with progressive structural joint damage. The objective of this retrospective cohort study was to evaluate the relative rate of hip and knee joint arthroplasties as an estimate of structural joint damage accrual, in a population of patients with acute CPP crystal arthritis.

Methods

Data were collected from Waikato District Health Board (WDHB) to identify an acute CPP crystal arthritis cohort with clinical episodes highly characteristic of acute CPP crystal arthritis. Data on hip and knee joint arthroplasties were collected from the New Zealand Orthopaedic Association's Joint Registry. The rate of arthroplasties in the cohort was compared with the age-ethnicity-matched New Zealand population. Additional analysis was performed for age, obesity (BMI) and ethnicity.

Results

The acute CPP crystal arthritis cohort included 99 patients; 63 were male and the median age was 77years (interquartile range, 71–82). The obesity rate was 36% with a median BMI of 28.4kg/m² (interquartile range, 25.8–32.2), comparable to the New Zealand population. The standardized surgical rate ratio in the cohort vs the age-ethnicity-matched New Zealand population was 2.54 (95% CI: 1.39, 4.27).

Conclusion

Our study identified a considerable increase in the rate of hip and knee joint arthroplasties in patients with episodes of acute CPP crystal arthritis. This suggests CPP crystal arthritis may be a chronic condition, leading to progressive joint damage.

Crystal arthritis is the most common type of inflammatory arthritis, and fractures contribute to significant morbidity and mortality, therefore, the relationship between the two is of clinical importance.

Recent Findings

There have been variable findings regarding hyperuricemia, low bone density and risk of fracture. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis of available literature showed a correlation between increased serum uric acid and lower risk of fracture. Less is known about calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease and bone health, although two large studies have suggested an association with osteopenia.

Summary

A systematic review and meta-analysis of available data suggest a correlation between increased serum uric acid and lower risk of fracture. Findings support an association between bone health and crystal arthritis which warrants further study and may have implications for how we treat gout.

### The structural consequences of calcium crystal deposition [^f29b980e]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate and basic calcium phosphate (BCP) crystals are the most common calcium-containing crystals associated with rheumatic disease. Clinical manifestations of calcium crystal deposition include acute or chronic inflammatory and degenerative arthritides and certain forms of periarthritis. The intra-articular presence of BCP crystals correlates with the degree of radiographic degeneration. Calcium crystal deposition contributes directly to joint degeneration. Vascular calcification is caused by the deposition of calcium hydroxyapatite crystals in the arterial intima. These deposits may contribute to local inflammation and promote further calcification, thus aggravating the atherosclerotic process. Calcium crystal deposition results in substantial structural consequence in humans.

Arthritis & Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Reputed to be a rare but specific manifestation of the disease when present, the CDS phenotype was experienced by 7.3% of participants with CPPD disease in our cohort, which was assembled to aid in classification criteria development and therefore may overrepresent rare but highly specific manifestations of CPPD disease. Prevalence of crowned dens features on CT (calcification of the transverse ligament of the atlas) varied between 25% and 60% in case series of people with CPPD disease, but the prevalence of symptoms related to these deposits is unknown. In the COLCHICORT trial, 5% of participants with acute episodes of CPPD disease had CDS, and in the European cohort of people with chronic phenotypes of CPPD, 35 (27%) of 129 had cervical pain, although the exact proportion of participants fulfilling the strict definition of the CDS is unknown. The association of CDS with male sex in our study is not consistent with previous case series, which found either no sex ratio imbalance or a female predominance. In a previous small case series of 12 people with CDS, peripheral imaging evidence of CPPD was inconsistent, whereas in our cohorts, the CDS phenotype was associated with more extensive chondrocalcinosis than the other phenotypes. A French case series of 37 participantsfound the same result and showed that the CDS phenotype exhibited some association with radiographic OA (of STT joints), but this association was less marked than the one with persistent arthritis. However, this more extensive CPPD observed in CDS was not associated with metabolic causes that are known to be associated with extensive chondrocalcinosis, including of the spine like in Gitelman disease. However, this could be due to small sample size.

Basic calcium phosphate (BCP) and calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate crystals are the most common types of pathologic calcium-containing crystals. Although these crystals long have been associated with a variety of rheumatic syndromes, recent evidence implicates BCP crystals in the pathogenesis of breast cancer and atherosclerosis. Although understanding of molecular mechanisms involved in generating these pathologic effects has been advanced significantly in recent years, they still are understood incompletely. Such advances are essential to the ongoing search for effective therapies for crystal-associated diseases.

### Compressive cervical myelopathy due to calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate deposition disease… [^c8ee6c3a]. JAMA Network (1999). Excellent credibility.

Calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate deposition disease is an inflammatory arthropathy that is defined by the deposition of CPPD crystals in articular and periarticular structures. The deposition of CPPD in hyaline cartilage and fibrocartilage leads to the chondrocalcinosis that is characteristic of the disease. It can occur independently or in association with any of a number of inflammatory or endocrine disorders. This form of crystal-induced arthritis tends to affect the peripheral joints, particularly the knees, ankles, shoulders, wrists, and second and third metacarpophalangeal joints, but involvement of the lumbar spine is not uncommon. Cervical spine disease due to CPPD deposition is, however, rare. We report a case of compressive cervical myelopathy due to CPPD deposition disease of the cervical spine in a woman with long-standing rheumatoid arthritis.

We also, from a review of the English-language literature, describe the collective reported clinical experience with CPPD deposition disease of the cervical spine. Fye KH, Weinstein PR, Donald F.

Introduction

Calcium pyrophosphate deposition (CPPD)is a pathogenic condition related to the presence of calcium pyrophosphate (CPP) crystal deposits in articular and periarticular tissues that can be asymptomatic CPPD or symptomatic CPPD disease.

In 2019, a review highlighted the challenges in describing CPPD, despite prior work to standardise this terminology. In 1985, Ryan and McCarty recognised five phenotypes of a general disease called ' calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPPD) crystal deposition disease': 'asymptomatic (lanthanic) calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate crystal deposition', ' pseudo-osteoarthritis', ' pseudogout', ' pseudo rheumatoid arthritis' and ' pseudoneuropathic joints' and also some rare phenotypes. Then, the proposed terminology by the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) in 2011 recognised the term ' calcium pyrophosphate deposition (CPPD)' as the umbrella term for all instances of CPP crystal occurrence, while the cartilage calcification was defined as 'chondrocalcinosis (CC)'. EULAR recognised four phenotypes, abandoning the prefix 'pseudo' to reduce confusion. However, there is ongoing imprecision in differentiating between asymptomatic and symptomatic forms. Thus, clinicians and investigators are currently faced with a variety of terms (eg, calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease, chondrocalcinosis, pseudogout and pyrophosphate arthropathy) that have been used and are still used interchangeably to describe different pathologic features and clinical states of the condition.

### High prevalence of chondrocalcinosis and frequent comorbidity with calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease in patients with seronegative rheumatoid arthritis [^8c2b4c37]. RMD Open (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Calcium pyrophosphate crystal deposition disease (CPPD), a rather common but not well studied disease to date, may present as an acute arthritis or a chronic arthropathy with development of radiographic structural changes, or may present as an often incidental radiographic finding called chondrocalcinosis (CC). The clinical presentation of patients with CPPD is variableand may well resemble other rheumatic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) and even ankylosing spondylitis. In the absence of a decisive test some uncertainty regarding the diagnosis often remains. Some years ago, a EULAR task force tried to standardise the terminology and classification of CPPD. The experts agreed that 'CPPD' should be used as the umbrella term that includes asymptomatic CPPD, acute CPP crystal arthritis, chronic inflammatory polyarthritis associated with CPPD and osteoarthritis (OA) with CPPD. CC defines cartilage calcification, most commonly due to CPPD and detected by imaging or histological examination. A total of 11 key recommendations were agreed on regarding the topics of clinical features, synovial fluid (SF) examination, imaging, comorbidities, and risk factors.

The epidemiology of manifestations and phenotypes of CPPD has not been clarified to date. Although intra-articular CPPD occurs in all ages and both sexes, it is associated with older age, haemochromatosis, hyperparathyroidism, hypophosphatasia and hypomagnesaemia. Whether women are more frequently affected than men is unclear. Rarely, CPPD can be inherited as a monogenic autosomal dominant disease.

The reported prevalence of CPPD depends on the joints studied. In an Italian survey CC was among the five most prevalent musculoskeletal conditions with a prevalence of 0.42%. In other epidemiological studies, CC was found in 7%–10% of knees in combination with hands, wrists, hips and the symphysis pubis, respectively.CPPD seems to predominantly affect knees, but it does also occur in the absence of knee CC. An association of CC with OA has been reported, but hip OA does not associate with CC at the hip or distant joints.CPPD may also manifest at the spine, not only in form of the crowned dens syndrome.

### Update in calcium deposition diseases [^ea0b5bcd]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate and basic calcium phosphate crystals are common components of osteoarthritic synovial fluids and define subsets of patients with inflammatory or rapidly destructive arthritis. Recent literature concerning clinical and etiologic aspects of calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate and basic calcium phosphate crystal arthritis are reviewed.

Recent Findings

Recent literature reminds us of the propensity of calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate deposition disease to mimic other syndromes affecting the elderly. Several new studies reinforce the prevalence and significance of extra-articular calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate deposits, and demonstrate the presence of basic calcium phosphate-like whitlockite crystals in intervertebral discs. Current work serves to increase our appreciation for the complex role of the putative pyrophosphate transporter, ANKH, in healthy and diseased cartilage. The application of newer radiographic techniques to the diagnosis of calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate deposition disease holds promise for easier and more accurate identification of these crystal deposits in vivo. Work demonstrating the efficacy of a crystal poison in an animal model of osteoarthritis provides good evidence for a pathogenic role of calcium crystals in osteoarthritis, and hope for new therapies for these diseases.

Summary

Continued work will further our understanding of these common crystals and their associated clinical syndromes.

Arthritis & Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Data collection

A standardized case report form was completed by the participant's rheumatologist. It ascertained information on the following: demographic data (age, sex); CPPD disease (duration of symptoms [≤ or > 2 years], acute inflammatory arthritis and localization, persistent inflammatory arthritis, CDS); family history of CPPD disease; presence of metabolic predisposition (hypercalcemia, primary hyperparathyroidism, hypomagnesemia, genetic hemochromatosis); results of synovial fluid analysis (presence, absence of CPP crystals); imaging evidence of CPPD (collected as part of routine clinical care, not study protocol); and rheumatologist assessment of radiographic osteoarthritis (OA) specifically at the second or third metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint, wrist, scapho‐trapezo‐trapezoid (STT) joint, or scapholunate advanced collapse (SLAC) wrist (when available). To standardize data collection, recruiting centers were sent definitions of acute inflammatory arthritis (an episode with acute onset or acute worsening of joint pain with swelling and/or warmth that resolves irrespective of treatment), persistent inflammatory arthritis (an ongoing joint swelling with pain and/or warmth in ≥ 1 joint), and CDS (defined by the following clinical [A] and imaging [B] features, both needing to be present):
Clinical features: Acute or subacute onset of severe pain localized to the upper neck with elevated inflammatory markers, limited rotation, and often fever. Mimicking conditions such as polymyalgia rheumatica and meningitis should be excluded.
Imaging features: Conventional CT with calcific deposits, typically linear and less dense than cortical bone, in the transverse retro‐odontoid ligament (transverse ligament of the atlas), often with an appearance of two parallel lines in axial views. Calcifications at the atlanto‐axial joint, alar ligament, and/or in pannus adjacent to the tip of the dens are also characteristic. dual‐energy computed tomography features include a dual‐energy index between 0.016 and 0.036).

From the initial cohort, those that met the classification criteria for CPPD disease according to the 2023 ACR/EULAR classification criteria were included in the current study.

### Diagnostic value of ultrasound in calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^55cb0c0b]. RMD Open (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Calcium pyrophosphate deposition (CPPD) disease is one of the two main crystal-related arthropathies associated with gout and one of the most common inflammatory joint diseases. It involves the formation of chronic or acute calcium pyrophosphate crystals in joints, fibrous cartilage, tendons or bursa/recesses. Recognised risk factors are ageing, osteoarthritis (OA), previous joint trauma/injury, metabolic disease (haemochromatosis, hyperparathyroidism, hypomagnesaemia) and familial predisposition. The clinical presentation can vary, from asymptomatic to chronic or acute arthritis, frequently associated with OA. Since both acute and chronic CPPD disease can mimic with other severe arthritis such as septic arthritis and rheumatoid arthritis (RA), a precise diagnostic is of capital importance.

CPPD is definitively diagnosed by microscopy identification of characteristic calcium pyrophosphate crystals and was retained in the McCarty criteria for diagnosis of CPPD. However, synovial fluid aspiration or synovial biopsy is sometimes difficult to perform, especially with small joints. Therefore, assessment of imaging techniques to diagnose CPPD can be useful. Although X-rays remain widely prescribed by rheumatologists, they are not of great diagnostic value.

Ultrasound (US) has been widely used in daily rheumatology practice for more than 10 years and was recently evaluated in CPPD. However, the role of US in the diagnostic and management of CPPD is not well established. The European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) CPPD task force recommended routine use of US for CPPD diagnosis, and the sensitivity and specificity seemed excellent and possibly better than those of conventional X-rays.

This study aimed therefore to review the published literature for evidence for US as a diagnostic tool in CPPD, with a focus on validity, reproducibility and feasibility.

Regarding diagnostic procedures for calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease, more specifically with respect to synovial fluid analysis, EULAR 2011 guidelines recommend to perform synovial fluid analysis to identify characteristic calcium pyrophosphate crystals (parallelepipedic, predominantly intracellular crystals with absent or weak positive birefringence) for definitive diagnosis of CPPD. Recognize that characteristic calcium pyrophosphate crystals are occasionally observed in biopsied tissue.

### Calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate crystal deposition disease: imaging perspectives [^a7a4281f]. Current Problems in Diagnostic Radiology (2000). Low credibility.

Calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPPD) crystal deposition disease is widespread in elderly persons and has various clinical presentations that can be confounding to clinicians. It is characterized by acute, subacute, or chronic joint inflammation and deposition of CPPD crystals in hyaline cartilage, fibrocartilage, and other soft tissue structures. We have learned a great deal about imaging findings of CPPD crystal deposition disease. New facts about the disorder and clues to radiologic diagnosis continue to be revealed. This article will provide a review of imaging characteristics of this disease with emphasis on some recent findings. The nomenclature, epidemiology, classification, and pathophysiology will be explained. A discussion of the clinical manifestations and treatment will be followed by a review of the characteristic imaging features.

### Application of the 2023 ACR / EULAR classification criteria for calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease in a seronegative rheumatoid arthritis cohort [^da7afb79]. RMD Open (2024). Medium credibility.

The 2023 ACR/EULAR Classification Criteria for calcium pyrophosphate deposition (CPPD) disease were recently approved. These criteria used an adjusted domain scoring system including demographic, clinical and radiological characteristics, and synovial fluid crystal analysis. Their development was driven by the necessity to address diagnostic challenges arising from variable clinical presentations and the complexity of analysing synovial fluid seeking for CPP crystals, with their primary purpose being to identify patients eligible for inclusion in research studies. Differential diagnosis of CPPD-disease mostly involves rheumatoid arthritis (RA) for chronic-CPP crystal inflammatory arthritis, gout for acute-CPP crystal arthritis and osteoarthritis (OA) with CPPD (often identified incidentally). Particularly, discerning between chronic-CPP crystal arthritis and seronegative-RA can be challenging due to overlapping joint involvement, seronegativity, potential treatment responses and occasional coexistence.

We performed a retrospective cross-sectional analysis within a real-world clinical setting. Our objectives were to evaluate the proportion of patients diagnosed with seronegative-RA who fulfilled the CPPD-disease classification criteria, and to identify demographic and clinical differences among them based on whether they met or not the criteria. The cohort included all patients from an RA clinic who were visited during September to December 2022. Data were collected retrospectively from medical records, including demographic, clinical, serological biomarkers and imaging variables (conventional X-ray and/or ultrasound). The classification criteria were subsequently applied. Statistical analysis included χ² tests and t-tests to assess group differences.

We identified 364 RA patients, and excluded those positive for RF and/or anti-citrullinated protein antibodies. The final cohort included 96 patients, 24.4% of the initial sample. Of these, 74.7% were female, with a mean age at symptom onset of 59.3 (± 16.4) years and average disease duration of 8.35 years.

The substance is a salt of phosphoric acid and calcium, both occurring naturally and being already constituents of foods, whether intentionally added or naturally occurring.

The intake of phosphorous as a whole is not affected.

Phosphorous and calcium are ubiquitously present in foods. The difference in production of calcium acid pyrophosphates compared to the notified way of manufacturing in GRN 420 improves safety since it reduces the amount of aluminium added to foods. Additionally, transparency for the consumer increases since the omission of aluminium in the production does not form aluminium phosphates likewise in the manufacturing described in GRN 420.

### Calcium crystals in osteoarthritis [^1aefb804]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2002). Low credibility.

Osteoarthritis is the most common form of arthritis in adults and its incidence increases with age. More than 50% of people aged 65 and older have radiographic changes of knee osteoarthritis. Calcium crystals, including calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate and basic calcium phosphate crystals, are also common in the elderly. Not surprisingly, osteoarthritis and crystal arthropathy frequently coexist. The question of a role for calcium crystals in causing or worsening osteoarthritis has been pondered for many years. Progress in understanding the interrelationships between calcium crystals and osteoarthritis has been slowed by our limited knowledge of the pathogenesis of both osteoarthritis and calcium crystal-induced arthritis and our limited ability to accurately detect calcium crystals. Nonetheless, there are good data from clinical and laboratory studies supporting an important role for calcium crystals in osteoarthritis.

### The significance of intracellular versus extracellular calcium pyrophosphate crystals in diagnosing calcium pyrophosphate crystal arthritis [^2cf12c10]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Acute and chronic calcium pyrophosphate (CPP) crystal arthritis is characterized by the presence of synovial CPP crystals within a clinically inflamed joint. CPP crystals may be situated intracellularly or extracellularly; however, the clinical significance of their location remains understudied. The objective of this retrospective cohort study was to assess the relevance of the CPP crystal location in diagnosing acute/chronic CPP crystal arthritis.

Methods

Data were collected from Waikato District Health Board to identify a study population with synovial fluid samples positive for CPP crystals. The cohort was stratified into 2 groups based on crystal location: intracellular and extracellular. The proportions of acute/chronic CPP crystal arthritis cases were compared between these groups. Acute/chronic CPP crystal arthritis was diagnosed when synovial CPP crystals were present, with objective evidence of joint inflammation and no other alternative diagnosis. Further analysis was made with respect to demographics, other laboratory results, and cartilage calcification.

Results

This study included 134 patients: 108 with intracellular CPP crystals and 26 with extracellular CPP crystals. Acute/chronic CPP crystal arthritis was diagnosed in 85% of cases in the intracellular and 50% in the extracellular group (P < 0.001). Following exclusion of septic arthritis cases, acute/chronic CPP crystal arthritis was diagnosed in 97% of patients in the intracellular group and in 62% of those in the extracellular group (P < 0.001).

Conclusion

The presence of intracellular CPP crystals is more strongly associated with acute/chronic CPP crystal arthritis than with extracellular CPP crystals alone.

### High prevalence of chondrocalcinosis and frequent comorbidity with calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease in patients with seronegative rheumatoid arthritis [^86224ffb]. RMD Open (2022). Medium credibility.

The 2010 ACR/EULAR classification criteria for RA also stress, next to the presence of an erosion which, in our study, was more often found in seropositive RA than in CPPD (48% vs 30%), that other inflammatory rheumatic diseases should have been excluded. In a clinical situation with a symmetric arthritis of the hands and or wrists and a radiograph showing CC this is clearly not so easy — especially if the onset was not sudden and did not have the character of an acute attack.

The differences in treatment found in our study are consistent with current strategies in the management of CPPD but there is no evidence for the treatment of this 'common but neglected form of arthritis' by commonly administered agents such as NSAIDs, corticosteroids and colchicine. Nevertheless, there is limited evidence for an effect of the anti-interleukin (IL)-1 bDMARD anakinra. Although the effect of an anti-IL-1 agent may argue in favour of an autoinflammatory disease, it is stressed that anakinra is also approved for the treatment of RA.

In summary, our data show for the first time that the comorbidity of CPPD and the prevalence of CC is more frequent in seronegative than in seropositive RA. The clinical similarity between these two diseases makes correct diagnoses difficult. More studies with innovative imaging techniques may change this. Prospective cohort studies and randomised clinical trials are urgently needed to provide an evidence basis for the management of this rather prevalent rheumatic disease in the elderly. The recent framework paper by the Outcome Measures in Rheumatology working group to develop core sets for short-term and long-term studies in CPPDmay well be a good step forward in this direction.

### Imaging features of calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease: consensus definitions from an international multidisciplinary working group [^8f9dc7dc]. Arthritis Care & Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

To develop definitions for imaging features being considered as potential classification criteria for calcium pyrophosphate deposition (CPPD) disease, additional to clinical and laboratory criteria, and to compile example images of CPPD on different imaging modalities.

Methods

The American College of Rheumatology and European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology CPPD classification criteria Imaging Advisory Group (IAG) and Steering Committee drafted definitions of imaging features that are characteristic of CPPD on conventional radiography (CR), conventional computed tomography (CT), dual-energy CT (DECT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). An anonymous expert survey was undertaken by a 35-member Combined Expert Committee, including all IAG members. The IAG and 5 external musculoskeletal radiologists with expertise in CPPD convened virtually to further refine item definitions and voted on example images illustrating CR, CT, and DECT item definitions, with ≥ 90% agreement required to deem them acceptable.

Results

The Combined Expert Committee survey indicated consensus on all CR definitions. The IAG and external radiologists reached consensus on CT and DECT item definitions, which specify that calcium pyrophosphate deposits appear less dense than cortical bone. The group developed an MRI definition and acknowledged limitations of this modality for CPPD. Ten example images for CPPD were voted acceptable (4 CR, 4 CT, and 2 DECT), and 3 images of basic calcium phosphate deposition were voted acceptable to serve as contrast against imaging features of CPPD.

Conclusion

An international group of rheumatologists and musculoskeletal radiologists defined imaging features characteristic of CPPD on CR, CT, and DECT and assembled a set of example images as a reference for future clinical research studies.

Nearly 75% of patients with CPPD disease and none of disease controls had ≥ 4 joints with CPPD in an extended US scanning protocol of 20 joints.
Knees, wrists and hips should always be included in US scanning protocols for CPPD; the US assessment of other joints should be considered in specific circumstances.
A reduced six-joint US scanning protocol showed excellent accuracy (both sensitivity and specificity > 90%) and good feasibility for the diagnosis of CPPD disease.

### Section 43.-chondrocalcinosis and pseudogout… [^1dcb9a96]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Chondrocalcinosis may be defined as the presence of calcium-containing salts in fibrocartilage and hyaline cartilage of one or more joints. 1–3 These salts include calcium pyrophosphate, calcium hydroxyapatite, and calcium orthophosphate. The term pseudogout refers to the acute and/or chronic inflammatory synovitis associated with the appearance of calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate crystals in the joint fluid, usually in conjunction with cartilage calcification. In this sense, pseudogout is a crystal-induced arthritis. Most attacks of pseudogout occur in elderly individuals in whom chondrocalcinosis often coexists with severe osteoarthritis. Chondrocalcinosis has also been encountered with increased frequency in patients with hyperparathyroidism, alkaptonuria, hemochromatosis, Wilson's disease, acromegaly, and perhaps in gout as well. 4 In addition, familial polyarticular chondrocalcinosis has been observed.

### Acute calcium pyrophosphate crystal arthritis flare rate and risk factors for recurrence [^3cf2481b]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

Little is known about acute calcium pyrophosphate (CPP) crystal arthritis flare rates and risk factors for recurrence. We characterized flares and determined the rate and predictors of acute CPP crystal arthritis flares in an academic medical center cohort.

Methods

We performed a retrospective cohort study among a random sample of patients with acute CPP crystal arthritis identified in the Partners HealthCare electronic medical record, 1991–2017. Flare was defined as self-limited, acute-onset synovitis with synovial fluid CPP crystals and/or chondrocalcinosis, not better explained by another cause. We calculated incidence rates (IR) for acute CPP crystal arthritis flare among all subjects and by sex. We estimated HR for recurrent flare using univariate Cox models that accounted for within-person correlated data.

Results

We identified 70 patients with acute CPP crystal arthritis with a total of 111 flares. Recurrent flares occurred in 24% of patients; half of flares occurred in a previously unaffected joint. The acute CPP crystal arthritis flare rate was 11.4 per 100 person-years overall (95% CI 8.2–15.4), 14.2 in women (95% CI 9.6–0.1), and 7.1 in men (95% CI 3.4–13.0). Cancer (HR 2.98, 95% CI 1.33–6.68) and chronic kidney disease (HR 2.92, 95% CI 1.10–7.76) were associated with a higher rate for recurrent flare.

Conclusion

Recurrent flares occurred in about one-fourth of patients with acute CPP crystal arthritis and often occurred in previously unaffected joints. The acute CPP crystal arthritis flare rate was twice as high in women as in men.

### Extracellular matrix changes regulate calcium crystal formation in articular cartilage [^2f7f3c12]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The pathologic matrix mineralization seen in calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate and basic calcium phosphate deposition diseases identifies a subset of osteoarthritis patients with an unusual joint distribution and rapid progression of disease. Several factors contribute to pathologic matrix mineralization, including changes in the extracellular matrix of articular cartilage. The factors contributing to extracellular matrix changes that promote crystal formation are important and not well understood. Better characterization of these factors will enhance the understanding of the pathogenesis of pathologic matrix mineralization and may identify potential targets for novel therapeutic interventions.

Recent Findings

Histologic studies of cartilage from patients affected by calcium crystal arthritis show changes in the pericellular matrix of articular chondrocytes. The amounts and types of collagens, proteoglycans, and calcium-binding proteins are altered. The mechanisms by which these changes occur remain poorly understood. Recent work, however, has implicated alterations in the chondrocyte phenotype and post-translational matrix-modulating enzymes such as the transglutaminases.

Summary

Changes in extracellular matrix are associated with the pathologic matrix mineralization seen in calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate and basic calcium phosphate crystal deposition diseases. The literature on growth plate cartilage provides observations and mechanisms through which extracellular matrix contributes to normal matrix mineralization, and has served as a model on which to base studies in articular cartilage. More studies are warranted to enhance the understanding of how changes in extracellular matrix contribute to crystal deposition diseases.

### Severe calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate deposition disease of the metacarpophalangeal joints [^894d926f]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

This case report highlights a 77-year-old woman with chronic CPPD on low-dose prednisone therapy due to contraindications for first-line therapy, who has a significant burden of chondrocalcinosis in her knees, wrists and MCP joints leading to a false-diagnosis of RA initially. Treating chronic arthritides in the setting of multiple comorbidities is both common and challenging. Alternative medical and non-medical strategies are not well established. Further research is necessary to investigate the benefits of novel selective therapies in the management of chronic CPPD. In addition, it is important to recognise that any acute CPPD attack may be a harbinger of often a more 'critical' systemic process.

Learning points

Calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease (CPPD) is a disease of the joints caused by calcium pyrophosphate deposition.
It is rare to see chondrocalcinosis in all metacarpophalangeal joints.
An acute CPPD attack may be a response to an underlying infection.
Comorbidities such as end-stage renal disease limit options for therapy and make treatment a challenge.
New therapies have yet to be validated, but interleukin-1β inhibitors may be a promising future therapy.

### 2022 EULAR recommendations for screening and prophylaxis of chronic and opportunistic infections in adults with autoimmune inflammatory rheumatic diseases [^94f3a1bb]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2023). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease, more specifically with respect to screening for chronic infections, EULAR 2023 guidelines recommend to consider screening for chronic HCV infection before initiating conventional synthetic, biological, or targeted synthetic DMARDs, immunosuppressants, or corticosteroids (according to dose and duration). Screen for chronic HCV infection in patients with elevated ALT or known risk factors.

### Nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic management of CPP crystal arthritis and BCP arthropathy and periarticular syndromes [^9ec154e1]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Calcium crystal arthritis is often unrecognized, poorly managed, and few effective therapies are available. The most common types of calcium crystals causing musculoskeletal syndromes are calcium pyrophosphate (CPP) and basic calcium phosphate (BCP). Associated syndromes have different clinical presentations and divergent management strategies. Acute CPP arthritis is treated similarly to acute gouty arthritis, whereas chronic CPP and BCP arthropathy may respond to strategies used for osteoarthritis. Calcific tendonitis is treated with a variety of interventions designed to dissolve BCP crystals. A better understanding of the causes and larger well-planned trials of current therapies will lead to improved care.

### Clinical implications of pathogenic calcium crystals [^cca0fa17]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The role of intraarticular calcifications has been challenged over the past years, with respect to cartilage destruction, especially in osteoarthritis.

Recent Findings

Main themes reviewed in this article will discuss prevalence of articular cartilage calcifications, mechanisms of cartilage calcifications, and mostly the pathogenic role of both calcium pyrophosphate and basic calcium phosphate crystals.

Summary

A direct pathogenic role of both calcium crystals has been depicted, in cartilage as a crystal-induced stress, or via acute or chronic crystal-induced synovitis.

### Imaging features of crystal-induced arthropathy [^459cf6c0]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

Crystal-induced arthropathies constitute a spectrum of inflammatory arthritides that is induced by cellular reaction to crystal deposition in and around joints. A variety of microcrystals may be deposited and can induce an inflammatory response. The three most common types of crystal-induced arthropathy are gout, calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate deposition disease, and calcium hydroxyapatite deposition disease. Each has a characteristic clinical presentation, crystal type that may be aspirated from affected tissues, and radiographic appearance. Each of these entities may occur as a primary abnormality or secondary to an underlying disorder. Sometimes these diseases may coexist in the same joint or individual. Imaging frequently plays a crucial role in the diagnosis of crystal-induced arthropathies and may help to monitor disease progression and treatment response.

### Systematic literature review on calcium pyrophosphate deposition (CPPD) nomenclature: condition elements and clinical States – A gout, hyperuricaemia and crystal-associated disease network (G-CAN) consensus project [^a1bcbe8f]. RMD Open (2025). Medium credibility.

Future analysis will be performed to evaluate the impact of the 2011 EULAR recommendations for CPPD terminology and diagnosis on the variability of the terminology.

Based on the findings from this SLR, experts in CPPD from the G-CAN membership will be invited to participate in Delphi exercises, to reach agreement on condition's state labels and definitions for use in technical and scientific communications. Subsequently, this group will develop an easily understandable statement describing CPPD in a language that can be used in conversations with the lay public, media, non-governmental organisations, funders, healthcare providers and other stakeholders (common language definition).

To conclude, contemporary CPPD nomenclature is characterised by large heterogeneity and a lack of precision in the labels used to describe all aspects of the condition. The development of agreed nomenclature would positively impact both research quality and clinical practice. The current work provides the basis for agreement regarding the labels and definitions of this condition.

### Systematic literature review on calcium pyrophosphate deposition (CPPD) nomenclature: condition elements and clinical States – A gout, hyperuricaemia and crystal-associated disease network (G-CAN) consensus project [^845ee756]. RMD Open (2025). Medium credibility.

For each article, the title, journal, first author, publication year, study type, the clinical state of the condition (if symptomatic or not), the diagnostic criteria used (McCarty criteria, synovial fluid analysis, imaging, histology, expert opinion) and the imaging applied, if available (conventional radiology, ultrasonography, CT, dual-energy CT, MRI, others), were recorded (see online supplemental table S2).

The data about pathogenic condition and pathogenic crystal names and abbreviations, imaging condition elements and clinical condition states were recorded according to an a priori list, generated by the authors before the start of the SLR and updated during data collection if appropriate.

Extracted labels were recorded verbatim, according to the following concepts:

Pathogenic condition: name, abbreviation and abbreviation meaning
Pathogenic crystal: name and abbreviation
Crystal deposition elements: the macroscopic deposition of pathogenic crystal in tissues, the microscopic deposition of pathogenic crystal in tissues and the presence of pathogenic crystal in synovial fluid analysis (SFA).
Imaging condition elements: evidence of pathogenic crystal deposition on conventional X-ray, on US, on CT, on MRI and on DECT; imaging evidence of structural cartilage damage due to pathogenic crystal deposits.
Asymptomatic evidence of pathogenic crystal deposition: on SFA, on conventional radiography, on US and on CT scan.
Symptomatic condition states: mono, oligo, polyarticular or periarticular nature of inflammation triggered by the presence of pathogenic crystals; acute peripheral articular inflammation triggered by the presence of pathogenic crystals; recurrent acute peripheral articular inflammation triggered by the presence of pathogenic crystals; persistent peripheral articular inflammation triggered by the presence of pathogenic crystals; skin and subcutaneous involvement with evidence of crystal deposits composed of calcium pyrophosphate; cervical spinal involvement with evidence of crystal deposits composed of calcium pyrophosphate; lumbar spinal involvement with evidence of crystal deposits composed of calcium pyrophosphate; symptomatic osteoarthritis (OA) related to crystal deposits composed of calcium pyrophosphate.

For this project, a condition state was defined as a clinically meaningful cluster based on rheumatology clinical practice experience, given the lack of consensus.

Patient and public involvement

Patients or the public were not involved in the design, conduct, reporting or dissemination plans of this SLR as it was not deemed appropriate. The project includes a second step for the development of lay terms for the condition that will include a large number of patients and stakeholders.

Assessment of the risk of bias

Given the descriptive nature of the data, there is no need to assess bias; therefore, no results will be presented on this issue.

Symptomatic condition states

Regarding pathogenic condition states, the acute peripheral form was described in 243/886 (27.4%) articles, the recurrent acute peripheral form in 46/886 (5.2%) and the persistent peripheral form in 88/886 (9.9%). Skin and subcutaneous involvement was described in 13/886 (1.5%), cervical spinal involvement in 162/886 (18.3%) and lumbar spinal involvement in 18/886 (2.0%). Finally, symptomatic OA related to crystal deposits composed of calcium pyrophosphate was described in 119/886 (13.4%).

The most used labels to describe one episode of acute peripheral articular inflammation were 'pseudogout' in 113/243 (46.5%) articles, ' acute CPP crystal arthritis' in 52/243 (21.4%) and ' acute pseudogout' in 22/243 (9.1%). The recurrence of an acute peripheral articular inflammation was also described as 'pseudogout' in 16/46 (34.8), ' acute recurrent CPP arthritis' in 4/46 (8.7) and ' pseudo-rheumatoid arthritis' in 3/46 (6.5). To describe a persistent peripheral articular inflammation, ' chronic CPP crystal arthritis' was found in 27/88 (30.7%), followed by ' pseudo-rheumatoid arthritis' in 25/88 (28.4%) and chronic arthritis in 15/88 (17.0%). For skin and subcutaneous involvement with evidence of pathogenic crystal deposits, ' tophaceous pseudogout' was used in 25/49 (51.0%), ' tophaceous CPPD' in 5/49 (10.2%), and ' tumorous CPPD' in 4/49 (8.2%). For spinal involvement, at the cervical level, labels were mainly ' crowned dens syndrome' in 122/162 (75.3%), followed by ' cervical cord compression/myelopathy' in 24/162 (14.8%) and ' cervical axial pain' in 20/162 (12.3%). At the lumbar level, labels were mainly ' lumbar axial pain' in 7/18 (38.9%), ' radiculopathy' in 6/18 (33.3%) and ' cauda equina syndrome' in 3/18 (16.7%). Finally, the most common labels used to identify symptomatic OA related to pathogenic crystal deposits were ' CPPD-related/associated OA' in 37/119 (31.1%), ' pseudo-osteoarthritis' in 25/119 (21.0%) and ' CPP crystal deposits with OA' in 15/119 (12.6%).

### Performance of hand radiographs in predicting the diagnosis in patients with early arthritis [^11867f6b]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the ability of baseline hand radiographs to predict the diagnosis 2 years later in a cohort of patients with early arthritis.

Methods

A total of 258 patients with arthritis onset within the previous year were evaluated. At baseline, all patients underwent a standardized evaluation including laboratory tests and radiographs. Hand radiographs were read by a blinded observer who used a standardized procedure for detecting features of crystal deposition diseases and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). After 30 ± 11.3 months, the final diagnosis was established by a panel of rheumatologists. All radiographs were evaluated.

Results

Significant associations were found between radiographic features and a clinical diagnosis of RA, calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPPD) arthritis, and hydroxyapatite arthritis. No radiographic abnormalities suggesting psoriatic arthritis or gout were seen. The sensitivities of hand radiographs for diagnosing CPPD or hydroxyapatite arthritis ranged from 80% to 100%. Baseline hand radiographs suggested the final diagnosis in 31/258 patients, including 21 (22.5%) of the 93 patients with RA, 10 of the 11 (91%) patients with CPPD or hydroxyapatite deposition disease, and none of the patients with other disorders. Sensitivity was 29%, specificity 86.5%, positive predictive value 61%, and negative predictive value 63%.

Conclusion

In our cohort of patients with recent arthritis, the overall performance of hand radiographs in predicting a diagnosis 2 years later was modest. However, they had an excellent diagnostic value for calcium deposition diseases.

### Development and internal-external cross-validation of a patient-reported definition for acute calcium pyrophosphate crystal arthritis [^7ba38b0c]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To develop and validate a patient-reported definition of acute calcium pyrophosphate (CPP) crystal arthritis in people with crystal-proven CPP deposition (CPPD) disease.

Methods

Consecutive patients with crystal-proven CPPD disease from seven centres across four countries were enrolled in a cross-sectional study. In each centre, patient-reported outcomes on the features of acute CPP crystal arthritis were collected. The expert opinion of an independent rheumatologist was the reference standard. We developed definitions based on multivariable logistic regression model with backward selection of predictors and classification and regression tree (CART) approaches.

Results

Two hundred and forty-six patients [mean age 73.2years (s.d. 10.7), 65.9% female] were enrolled. At the time of the assessment, acute CPP crystal arthritis was diagnosed in 96/246 (39.0%) participants. Patient-reported joint warmth, patient-reported joint swelling, time from pain onset to peak, and self-reported acute CPP crystal inflammatory arthritis were included in the multivariable logistic model. This model had good discrimination (optimism-adjusted c-index: 0.92; 95% CI: 0.89, 0.95) and calibration (optimism-adjusted calibration slope: 0.95; 95% CI: 0.71, 1.19; optimism-adjusted calibration-in-the-large: 0.005; 95% CI: -0.37, 0.37) in the internal validation. Probability threshold ≥ 0.53 had sensitivity of 0.83 (95% CI: 0.74, 0.90) and specificity of 0.86 (95% CI: 0.79, 0.91). Performances were similar in the internal-external cross-validation. The CART identified patient-reported acute CPP crystal inflammatory arthritis, followed by joint swelling and joint warmth as the most informative variables for ascertaining acute CPP crystal arthritis [sensitivity 0.83 (95% CI: 0.72, 0.91) and specificity 0.83 (95% CI: 0.74, 0.90)].

Conclusion

We developed and initially validated easy-to-use patient-reported definitions for acute CPP crystal arthritis for use in clinical trials and observational research in CPPD.

### High prevalence of chondrocalcinosis and frequent comorbidity with calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease in patients with seronegative rheumatoid arthritis [^5412e8b2]. RMD Open (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this study based on a large real life data set using diagnoses made by senior rheumatologists in a tertiary care centre we found clinically relevant similarities but also some important differences in patients with CPPD and RA. However, there is no clinical feature that can precisely differentiate between these diseases and SF is very often not available to detect specific crystals. Nevertheless, and of clinical importance, co-occurrence of CPPD, CC and RA was frequently diagnosed. Indeed, more than every fourth patient primarily diagnosed with seronegative RA fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for CPPD and that was clearly different in patients with seropositive RA, gout and PMR. In addition, for the first time, we show a significant difference between seropositive and seronegative RA in the prevalence of CC on hand radiographs.

Overall CPPD was diagnosed about 9 years later than RA but the onset of CPPD did not differ between patients with and without RA suggesting an independent development of the two. However, patients with both, CPPD and RA, had developed RA about 10 years later as compared with patients with RA only. Before we discuss the issue of ascertainment which is of course critical here we review some clinical data of our patient groups for comparison with earlier studies.

### Modulation of chondrocyte production of extracellular inorganic pyrophosphate [^2d299404]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Extracellular inorganic pyrophosphate (ePPi) both inhibits and promotes different forms of pathologic mineralization. Basic calcium phosphate (BCP) deposition results from depressed levels of ePPi while excess levels of ePPi leads to calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate crystal deposition (CPPD) disease. These crystals are also often identified in patients with osteoarthritis, the most prevalent form of arthritis causing significant morbidity.

Recent Studies

The two primary hypotheses for generation of ePPi, export of inorganic pyrophosphate through the multipass transmembrane protein ANK and generation of ePPi by ectoenzyme activity, continue to be supported and better understood through animal models and study of families with CPPD deposition disease.

Summary

As the pathophysiology of crystal formation in both articular cartilage and synovial fluid is better understood, the opportunity for prevention and treatment of pathologic mineralization increases. In particular, a more complex understanding of the ank gene, ectoenzyme PC-1, and the transglutaminase enzyme family may eventually translate into therapeutic application for both BCP deposition and CPPD deposition disease.

### Diagnosis and clinical manifestations of calcium pyrophosphate and basic calcium phosphate crystal deposition diseases [^a959f96a]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Basic calcium phosphate and pyrophosphate calcium crystals are the 2 main calcium-containing crystals that can deposit in all skeletal tissues. These calcium crystals give rise to numerous manifestations, including acute inflammatory attacks that can mimic alarming and threatening differential diagnoses, osteoarthritis-like lesions, destructive arthropathies, and calcific tendinitis. Awareness of uncommon localizations and manifestations such as intraspinal deposition (eg, crowned dens syndrome, tendinitis of longus colli muscle, massive cervical myelopathy compression) prevents inappropriate procedures and cares. Coupling plain radiography, ultrasonography, computed tomography, and synovial fluid analysis allow accurate diagnosis by directly or indirectly identifying the GRAAL of microcrystal-related symptoms.

### Severe calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate deposition disease of the metacarpophalangeal joints [^9fc500b3]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Background

Calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease (CPPD) is often difficult to distinguish from other joint pathologies based on clinical findings alone, which makes it an important disease to consider in the setting of joint pain. The pathogenesis of CPPD has not been fully elucidated but the formation of calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPP) crystals in the pericellular matrix of cartilage has been found to be a primary first step.CPPD is classically defined as having three distinct phenotypes including: acute (self-limited synovitis, formerly known as pseudogout), chronic (lasting several months) and asymptomatic CPPD. In the chronic form of CPPD, destruction occurs over time resulting in degenerative changes and osteoarthritis of the affected joints. The incidence of CPPD is known to increase with age and may be idiopathic, but known risk factors include a family history of CPPD and known polymorphisms in the ANKH gene (which encodes a transmembrane inorganic pyrophosphate shuttle protein), osteoarthritis (OA), chronic kidney disease (CKD), hyperparathyroidism, hypomagnesaemia and haemochromatosis. Symptoms may include pain, warmth and swelling of affected joints especially in acute attacks. Acute attacks of CPPD may last for weeks to months. However, many cases of CPPD are asymptomatic. CPPD is a systemic disease commonly resulting in a polyarticular pattern. Typical areas affected include joints of the knees, wrists, shoulders or hips. Any combination of these joints may be involved, and less often, CPPD can be monoarticular. Rarely, CPP crystals will deposit in intervertebral discs.

### Familial calcium crystal diseases: what have we learned? [^05114490]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2001). Low credibility.

The spectrum of heterotopic calcification or ossification is expanding because of the reports of several kindreds with calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease, apatite deposition disease, and others with less common syndromes associated with extracellular matrix calcification, such as fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva and related syndromes. Genomic DNA studies in both humans and mice provide a shortcut to understanding the genetic basis of promotion and prevention of ECM calcification. Mutation in the COL2A1 gene has been identified in one family with spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia and calcium pyrophosphate and apatite crystalline deposits. In another kindred with precocious osteoarthritis without spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia, the phenotype was linked to markers of chromosome 8. In four other kindreds, the phenotypes were linked to an area of chromosome 5p. Two genes located in this region, which are expressed in articular cartilage, are being investigated as possible calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease genes. The results of linkage studies in three kindreds with articular/periarticular ADD with the COL2A1 gene were noninformative. Two different mouse mutations, the ank/ank and the ttw/ttw mice, are associated with intra-articular and ligament apatite deposits caused by a decrease in extracellular pyrophosphate concentrations, mimicking human arthritis caused by apatite deposition disease. Mutations in the matrix GLA protein, both in mice and in humans, are also associated with vascular and articular calcification. These mouse mutations provide cutting-edge information in the investigation of the mechanisms of apatite deposition in humans.

### Severe calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate deposition disease of the metacarpophalangeal joints [^10b9a2a3]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

We report a case of calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease (CPPD) with an unusual presentation of severe chondrocalcinosis with atypical large burden deposited in the metacarpophalangeal joints as well as more typical deposition in wrists and knees as demonstrated on plain radiographs. A 77-year-old African-American woman 1-year status post parathyroidectomy for hyperparathyroidism initially presented to the rheumatology clinic to treat suspected rheumatoid arthritis given her pattern of joint involvement but was found to have CPPD. The patient's history is notable for end-stage renal disease which complicates medical management. This case illustrates radiographic findings of CPPD and explores the challenges of treating CPPD in the setting of comorbid conditions.

### Clinical features and risk of recurrence of acute calcium pyrophosphate crystal arthritis [^6b67fb4a]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

It is unclear whether attack recurrence rates are similar between acute calcium pyrophosphate (CPP) crystal arthritis and gout. This study compared the clinical features and recurrence rates of both conditions.

Methods

In this retrospective study, we reviewed 106 patients with acute CPP crystal arthritis (based on the presence of CPP crystals and/or chondrocalcinosis) and 173 patients with gout (based on the presence of monosodium urate crystals). We analysed clinical variables and compared them between the two conditions. We identified factors associated with the recurrence of acute CPP crystal arthritis.

Results

Patients with acute CPP crystal arthritis were older (76.5 vs. 62 years, p < 0.001) and female (69.8% vs. 6.9%, p < 0.001); they had a lower body mass index (22.3 vs. 23.7, p = 0.002), lower renal insufficiency rate (27.4% vs. 41.6%, p = 0.016), and higher rate of preceding infection (22.6% vs. 11.0%, p = 0.009) than those with acute gout. Recurrence rates were similar between the groups (19.1% vs. 22.9%, p = 0.562). Use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) [hazard ratio (HR), 5.625; 95% CI, 1.672–18.925; p = 0.005] and warfarin (HR, 7.301; 95% CI, 1.930–27.622; p = 0.003) or exposure to chemotherapy (HR, 5.663; 95% CI, 1.180–27.169; p = 0.03) were associated with acute CPP crystal arthritis recurrence.

Conclusions

Acute CPP crystal arthritis was more common than acute gout in older women with preserved renal function. Physicians should be aware of the association between recurrence and PPI, warfarin, or chemotherapy use in these patients.

### Diagnosis of calcium pyrophosphate crystal deposition disease by ultrasonography: how many and which sites should be scanned? [^e2db28b6]. Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Calcium pyrophosphate deposition (CPPD) disease is a crystal arthropathy caused by the deposition of calcium pyrophosphate (CPP) crystals in and around the joint. It is a common symptomatic arthropathy with a reported population prevalence ranging from 0.4% (i.e. those with a symptomatic CPPD disease) to 13.2% (i.e. those with radiographic evidence of chondrocalcinosis). Moreover, CPPD disease is both a frequent primary cause of hospitalization and a common complication in people admitted to hospitals with another illness.

The gold standard for the diagnosis of CPPD disease is the identification of CPP crystals in the synovial fluid (SF) by compensated polarized light microscopy, or occasionally, in biopsied tissues. However, synovial fluid aspiration and/or analysis may not be always feasible (e.g. if small joints are affected or during inter-critical phases). Moreover, the absence of CPP crystal at synovial fluid analysis does not preclude a diagnosis of CPPD disease, as some studies have highlighted its suboptimal sensitivity in the detection of CPP crystals when compared with histology. Therefore, imaging techniques have a key role in clinical practice and in research, especially when laboratory evidence of CPP crystals is lacking. In the last decade, ultrasonography (US) has emerged as one of the most valid, accurate and reliable tools for the diagnosis of CPPD disease. However, the development of internationally accepted protocols for US imaging in CPPD remains one of the most important research priorities according to a recent survey carried out by the Gout, Hyperuricemia and Crystal-Associated Disease Network (G-CAN). This research priority has been emphasized in the ACR/EULAR classification criteria for CPPD disease, where both the imaging evidence of CPPD in symptomatic joints and the number of peripheral joints with evidence of CPPD on any imaging modality regardless of symptoms were considered in the criteria, but a clear guidance on which imaging modalities to use and how many joints to image was not given. Obviously, the more peripheral joints are imaged the greater the chance to identify imaging evidence of CPPD. However, an extensive imaging protocol is cost, time and labour intensive and burdens both physicians and patients. On the other hand, a reduced scanning protocol would increase the feasibility and the efficiency of US in clinical practice and in research. Thus, the main aim of this study was to assess the optimal number and sites to be scanned in order to maximize the accuracy of US for diagnosing CPPD disease.

### Calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate deposition disease (pseudogout) after total knee arthroplasty [^71b2be2b]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2007). Low credibility.

The authors report a case of calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate deposition disease (pseudogout) presenting in the early period after primary total knee arthroplasty. The patient's symptoms resolved with conservative management including colchicine and indomethacin. The presentation of pseudogout resembles septic arthritis and should be included in the differential diagnosis to prevent unnecessary surgery in these patients.

Methods

Study population

Consecutive patients aged ≥ 18 years, with a crystal-proven CPPD disease, who were seen for routine or urgent CPPD care, without applying any further selection criteria, and age- (± 2 years) and sex-matched controls with musculoskeletal rheumatic disease without CPP crystals at synovial fluid analysis were prospectively enrolled in this cross-sectional study. Synovial fluid analysis should have been performed no later than 6 months before the enrolment date. Participants were enrolled at the Rheumatology Unit of the Polytechnic University of Marche (Ancona, Italy) and the Department of Rheumatology of the Luigi Sacco University Hospital (Milan, Italy) from January 2021 to November 2022.

Patients with CPPD disease and another coexisting inflammatory arthritis were excluded. Participants were required to not have undergone joint injections in the last 3 months prior to the enrolment date and to not have previous major trauma, fracture or surgery of the joints included in the scanning protocol.

Clinical assessment

The following clinical and laboratory data were registered in all patients: age, sex, BMI, synovial fluid analysis results and disease duration. In addition, aetiology [i.e. idiopathic, or secondary (familiar or associated with metabolic conditions)] and clinical presentation according to 2011 EULAR recommendations were recorded in patients with CPPD disease.

Sonographic assessment

Four rheumatologists (E.C. E.F. G.F. and S.S.) carried out the US examinations: E.F. and G.F. had > 20 years of experience in the use of musculoskeletal US; E.C. and S.S. had 6 and 5 years of experience in this subject, respectively. All of them were members of the OMERACT US working group — CPPD Task Force. The sonographers were blinded to clinical and laboratory data. Moreover, patients were asked not to share clinical and laboratory information with the sonographers. US examinations were conducted using a My Lab Class C system (Esaote SpA, Genoa, Italy), equipped with two broadband linear transducers (8–13 and 6–18 MHz) and with a Samsung RS85 prestige (Samsung, Seoul, South Korea), equipped with two broadband linear transducers (2–14 and 4–18 MHz).

### Development and internal-external cross-validation of a patient-reported definition for acute calcium pyrophosphate crystal arthritis [^7da662ee]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Objective

To develop and validate a patient-reported definition of acute calcium pyrophosphate (CPP) crystal arthritis in people with crystal-proven CPP deposition (CPPD) disease.

Methods

Consecutive patients with crystal-proven CPPD disease from seven centres across four countries were enrolled in a cross-sectional study. In each centre, patient-reported outcomes on the features of acute CPP crystal arthritis were collected. The expert opinion of an independent rheumatologist was the reference standard. We developed definitions based on multivariable logistic regression model with backward selection of predictors and classification and regression tree (CART) approaches.

Results

Two hundred and forty-six patients [mean age 73.2 years (. 10.7), 65.9% female] were enrolled. At the time of the assessment, acute CPP crystal arthritis was diagnosed in 96/246 (39.0%) participants.

Patient-reported joint warmth, patient-reported joint swelling, time from pain onset to peak, and self-reported acute CPP crystal inflammatory arthritis were included in the multivariable logistic model. This model had good discrimination (optimism-adjusted c-index: 0.92; 95% CI: 0.89, 0.95) and calibration (optimism-adjusted calibration slope: 0.95; 95% CI: 0.71, 1.19; optimism-adjusted calibration-in-the-large: 0.005; 95% CI: −0.37, 0.37) in the internal validation. Probability threshold ≥ 0.53 had sensitivity of 0.83 (95% CI: 0.74, 0.90) and specificity of 0.86 (95% CI: 0.79, 0.91). Performances were similar in the internal–external cross-validation. The CART identified patient-reported acute CPP crystal inflammatory arthritis, followed by joint swelling and joint warmth as the most informative variables for ascertaining acute CPP crystal arthritis [sensitivity 0.83 (95% CI: 0.72, 0.91) and specificity 0.83 (95% CI: 0.74, 0.90)].

Conclusion

We developed and initially validated easy-to-use patient-reported definitions for acute CPP crystal arthritis for use in clinical trials and observational research in CPPD.
