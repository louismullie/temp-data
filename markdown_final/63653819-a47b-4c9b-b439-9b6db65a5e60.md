## Question

impact of covid on white blood cell count and netrophils

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how COVID-19 affects white blood cell counts and neutrophils, including quantitative changes, timing, mechanisms, prognostic value, comparisons with other respiratory viruses, special populations, and practical clinical recommendations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about baseline WBC patterns and how specific they are for COVID-19. Then, I should verify neutrophil-specific changes by severity and over time. Next, I will examine the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio as a composite marker and check for any pitfalls in threshold interpretation. After that, I need to review temporal dynamics, functional and morphological neutrophil abnormalities, and mechanistic pathways. I will then correlate these laboratory findings with clinical outcomes, compare them to influenza and non-COVID pneumonias, consider special populations and confounders, and finally synthesize clinical recommendations and a bottom-line summary.

> Let me first confirm the baseline WBC landscape in COVID-19, because I need to ensure we do not overinterpret nonspecific signals. Early in infection, most patients have normal or decreased WBC counts, with leukopenia seen in roughly 20–40% and leukocytosis in a smaller subset; critically, total WBC changes alone are nonspecific and cannot diagnose COVID-19, especially in emergency settings where overlaps with other illnesses are common [^111Wbtu2] [^114yFZ2F] [^116jQ9jy] [^117Bzj16].

> Now, focusing on neutrophils specifically, I need to check whether neutrophilia is universal or linked to severity. Meta-analytic data show neutrophil counts and percentages are significantly higher in severe versus non-severe COVID-19, and Cochrane analyses indicate that predefined increases in neutrophil count have moderate sensitivity with high specificity for predicting deterioration; however, this pattern emerges with advancing disease and is not a uniform feature of mild presentations, so I should avoid premature conclusions at admission [^1125XPUS] [^115kXKmL] [^1157cNce].

> Wait, let me verify the role of the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, because it integrates innate and adaptive signals. On admission, higher NLR is consistently associated with severe disease and mortality across meta-analyses and multivariable models, and even pediatric data show NLR correlates with severity, although absolute changes can be smaller in children; that said, NLR should augment rather than replace clinical judgment [^116b8UVA] [^117FJBQb] [^112n3gT4] [^114Fb6VY]. Hold on, I should correct a potential misstatement I initially considered: I almost cited an NLR threshold of 83 predicting death with > 90% accuracy, but on review that 83 value pertains to an IL-6 cutoff, not NLR, so using 83 for NLR would be incorrect; likewise, I started to equate an NLR of 2.74 with a 2.74-fold mortality risk, but the 2.74 figure in the meta-analysis is the mortality risk ratio for elevated versus normal NLR across varied study cutoffs, not a universal NLR threshold, so I should not over-specify a single NLR cut-point [^112R6z5Y] [^116b8UVA].

> Next, I need to examine temporal dynamics, because timing influences interpretation. Early disease often features lymphopenia with normal or mildly elevated neutrophils and overall WBC in the normal-to-low range; later, particularly beyond day 7 from symptom onset, progressive neutrophilia and deeper lymphopenia emerge in those who deteriorate, which amplifies the NLR and can serve as a warning trajectory on serial CBCs, especially when a rising absolute neutrophil count follows an initially quiescent phase [^112C7rRN] [^114g4Z3V] [^111FVEMz] [^114yFZ2F].

> I will now examine qualitative changes, because quantity alone does not capture neutrophil dysregulation. Peripheral smears and analyzer flags can reveal abnormal nuclear shapes, hypogranulation, and left-shifted or immature granulocytes, reflecting perturbed granulopoiesis under inflammatory stress; in parallel, circulating markers of NETosis, such as citrullinated histone H3 and cell-free DNA, rise with severity and correlate with respiratory support needs and short-term outcomes, reinforcing a mechanistic link to immunothrombosis [^111Wbtu2] [^112ZqqB1] [^111FVEMz].

> Let me think about the upstream mechanisms, and I should confirm whether they align with a myeloid-driven immunopathology. Deep immune profiling shows that classical monocytes drive hypercytokinemia and that hyperactivated neutrophils contribute to tissue injury via NET formation; distinct alterations in hematopoietic signals, including elevated IL-3 and suppressed Flt-3L, plausibly tilt bone marrow output toward myelopoiesis at the expense of lymphopoiesis, helping to explain high NLR in severe disease; within the lung, monocyte-neutrophil crosstalk fuels vascular inflammation and immunothrombosis, which are more pronounced in COVID-19 than influenza [^116wWGoc] [^1145vTCd] [^115ABgMb] [^112ZqqB1].

> Next, I should review prognostic performance against clinical outcomes to ensure clinical utility. Compared with total WBC, absolute neutrophil count and especially NLR better capture risk of progression and ICU admission, though neutrophil increase thresholds trade sensitivity for specificity; Cochrane estimates show that defining neutrophil elevation between roughly 4.7–10 × 10⁹/L yields specific but variably sensitive prediction of deterioration, while WBC decrease alone performs poorly as a prognostic signal; integrating NLR with CRP and platelets further improves discrimination in multivariable models [^115kXKmL] [^113QvZ3S] [^117FJBQb] [^1137f4pk].

> But wait, what if these neutrophil signatures merely reflect generic severe viral pneumonia rather than COVID-19 specifically. Hold on, I should verify comparative data. Histopathology and multi-omic studies indicate that vascular neutrophil recruitment and NET-driven immunothrombosis are more prominent in severe COVID-19 than in influenza pneumonia, though overlaps exist; clinically, early COVID-19 tends to show higher neutrophil counts and lower lymphocytes than influenza B, yet these differences lack diagnostic specificity at the individual level, and immune signatures can nonetheless distinguish COVID-19 from other non-SARS-CoV-2 critical pneumonias in research settings [^115ABgMb] [^114yFZ2F] [^114Vr4vR] [^113QvZ3S].

> I need to ensure I account for special populations and confounders. In children, neutrophil changes are typically less pronounced, but higher NLR still associates with hospitalization risk, and eosinopenia and atypical lymphocytes are common; in settings with HIV or tuberculosis, deeper lymphopenia and exaggerated inflammation complicate interpretation and underscore that neither neutrophilia nor lymphopenia is specific to COVID-19; corticosteroids can modify neutrophil kinetics and distribution, potentially confounding single time-point interpretation, so I should always anchor lab trends to treatment context [^112n3gT4] [^116jQ9jy].

> I should double-check post-acute consequences, because persistent neutrophil activation may carry prognostic meaning beyond the acute phase. Individuals with post-COVID interstitial changes at 3–6 months exhibit a sustained neutrophil-associated immune signature, including NET-related pathways in blood and airway, and some fail to fully normalize radiologic and functional metrics even at 12 months, suggesting enduring neutrophil-driven inflammation in a subset [^114fspB6].

> Next, I will translate this into practical clinical steps, keeping in mind evidence limitations and the need for serial assessment. On admission, obtain a CBC with differential and calculate NLR as part of a broader risk assessment, recognizing that higher NLR indicates greater risk but lacks a universally validated single cutoff; track absolute neutrophil count and NLR over time, as a rising neutrophil trajectory after day 7 should prompt closer monitoring; request a manual differential and morphology review when flags or left shift appear; integrate NLR with CRP, platelets, and D-dimer to improve prognostic accuracy and to anticipate thromboinflammatory complications; while routine WBC parameters support risk stratification, they should not be used to diagnose COVID-19 in place of virologic testing or guideline-based criteria [^111FVEMz] [^117FJBQb] [^113f1NYB] [^113v9gSh] [^117Bzj16].

> Let me reconsider any lingering ambiguities before I synthesize. Neutrophilia is a marker of severity and not a prerequisite for COVID-19 diagnosis, WBC totals are often normal or low early, NLR is robust but threshold-agnostic across studies, morphological and functional neutrophil abnormalities including NETosis link to immunothrombosis, and comparative data with influenza show greater vascular neutrophil activation in COVID-19 while acknowledging overlap and nonspecificity in routine counts [^111Wbtu2] [^1125XPUS] [^112ZqqB1] [^115ABgMb] [^116jQ9jy].

> Final synthesis: COVID-19 produces a time- and severity-dependent hematologic pattern characterized by early normal-to-low WBC with lymphopenia and later emergence of neutrophilia in deteriorating cases, which drives a higher NLR that correlates with severity and mortality; concomitant qualitative neutrophil abnormalities and NETosis underpin immunothrombosis and organ injury, are more pronounced than in influenza, and can persist in those with post-acute pulmonary sequelae; clinically, serial ANC and NLR tracking, integrated with inflammatory and coagulation markers and contextualized by therapies, provides meaningful prognostic information while avoiding overreliance on any single cutoff or on WBC metrics for diagnosis [^112C7rRN] [^116b8UVA] [^112ZqqB1] [^114fspB6] [^115kXKmL] [^114Vr4vR] [^117Bzj16].

COVID-19 causes **lymphopenia with neutrophilia** [^111Wbtu2] [^114Vr4vR] and an elevated neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) [^1125XPUS], especially in severe disease [^116b8UVA]. Neutrophilia and **high NLR** are linked to worse outcomes, including ARDS, ICU admission, and mortality [^1125XPUS] [^116b8UVA] [^113f1NYB]. Neutrophil activation and **NETs** drive hyperinflammation, immunothrombosis, and organ damage [^112ZqqB1] [^115ABgMb] [^112LjGgp]. Leukocytosis is less common and nonspecific, while neutropenia is rare and usually transient [^111Wbtu2] [^113zzsx5]. These changes reflect innate immune dysregulation and help stratify risk and guide management [^116wWGoc].

---

## Changes in white blood cell count

COVID-19 alters WBC counts; **lymphopenia** is a hallmark, and neutrophilia occurs in severe disease [^111Wbtu2] [^114Vr4vR] [^1125XPUS].

- **Leukopenia**: Occurs in 20–40% of patients, reflecting immune suppression or redistribution [^116pEhjg] [^111Wbtu2].
- **Leukocytosis**: Less common (3–24%) and often indicates secondary bacterial infection or severe inflammation [^117Bzj16] [^111Wbtu2].
- **Lymphopenia**: Present in 30–75%, especially in severe/critical illness, and correlates with worse outcomes [^111Wbtu2] [^114Vr4vR] [^1125XPUS].

---

## Neutrophil count and activation

Neutrophils are central to COVID-19 pathogenesis; **neutrophilia** and activation correlate with severity.

- **Neutrophilia**: Common in severe/critical cases [^1125XPUS] and associated with ARDS, ICU admission, and mortality [^114Vr4vR] [^114Fb6VY].
- **Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR)**: Elevated NLR is a strong predictor of severity and mortality [^1125XPUS] [^116b8UVA] [^114Fb6VY] [^112R6z5Y].
- **Neutrophil activation**: Excessive activation [^116wWGoc] and NETs drive hyperinflammation, immunothrombosis, and organ damage [^112ZqqB1] [^115ABgMb].

---

## Mechanisms underlying neutrophil changes

Neutrophil changes reflect **innate immune dysregulation** and hyperinflammation.

- **Cytokine storm**: Elevated IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α promote neutrophil recruitment and activation [^116wWGoc] [^112ZqqB1].
- **NET formation**: NETs contribute to endothelial injury, microvascular thrombosis, and organ dysfunction [^112ZqqB1] [^115ABgMb] [^112LjGgp].
- **Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs)**: Neutrophilic MDSCs expand in severe disease, contributing to immunosuppression and dysregulation [^11539ui6].

---

## Clinical implications and prognostic significance

Neutrophil changes have prognostic value and guide management: neutrophilia and **high NLR** predict severe disease, ARDS, ICU admission, and mortality [^1125XPUS] [^116b8UVA] [^114Fb6VY]. Serial CBC with differential and NLR aid risk stratification by identifying high-risk patients and guiding escalation [^111FVEMz] [^113v9gSh]. Neutrophil activation and NETs are potential therapeutic targets to mitigate hyperinflammation and thrombosis [^112ZqqB1] [^112LjGgp].

## Comparison with other viral infections

COVID-19 shows **distinct neutrophil patterns** compared with other viral infections.

| **Parameter** | **COVID-19** | **Influenza** | **SARS/MERS** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Neutrophilia | Common in severe cases [^1125XPUS] [^114Vr4vR] | Less prominent [^113JKKAj] | Variable |
| NLR | Elevated, strong prognostic marker [^1125XPUS] [^116b8UVA] | Less pronounced [^113JKKAj] | Variable |
| NETs | Prominent, linked to thrombosis [^112ZqqB1] [^115ABgMb] | Less prominent | Variable |

---

## Long-term hematological effects

COVID-19 can cause **persistent neutrophil activation** and immune dysregulation after recovery. Ongoing activation and NETs may contribute to long COVID and pulmonary sequelae [^114fspB6], while **immune dysregulation** reflects sustained innate and adaptive changes that may underlie chronic symptoms and complications [^114fspB6] [^113vZ9Y8].

---

COVID-19 causes **lymphopenia with neutrophilia**, with neutrophil activation and NETs driving hyperinflammation, immunothrombosis, and organ damage. Neutrophilia and high NLR predict severe outcomes and are useful for risk stratification and management.

### Vascular neutrophilic inflammation and immunothrombosis distinguish severe COVID-19 from influenza pneumonia [^115ABgMb]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2021). Low credibility.

Infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can lead to severe pneumonia, thrombotic complications, and non-pulmonary organ failure. Recent studies suggest that intravascular neutrophil activation and subsequent immune cell-triggered immunothrombosis serve as a central pathomechanism linking the heterogeneous clinical picture of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We sought to determine whether immunothrombosis is a pathognomonic factor in COVID-19 or a general feature of viral pneumonia, as well as to better understand its upstream regulation.

By comparing histopathological specimens of SARS-CoV-2 with influenza-affected lungs, we show that vascular neutrophil recruitment, NETosis, and subsequent immunothrombosis are typical features of severe COVID-19, but less prominent in influenza pneumonia. Activated neutrophils were typically found in association with monocytes. To explore this further, we combined clinical data of COVID-19 cases with comprehensive immune cell phenotyping and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid scRNA-seq data. We show that a HLADR low CD9 low monocyte population expands in severe COVID-19, releasing neutrophil chemokines in the lungs, which might explain neutrophil expansion and pulmonary recruitment in the late stages of severe COVID-19.

Our data underline an innate immune cell axis causing vascular inflammation and immunothrombosis in severe SARS-CoV-2 infection.

### Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio on admission to predict the severity and mortality of COVID-19 patients: A meta-analysis [^116b8UVA]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), an inflammatory marker, was suggested to be predictive of severity and mortality in COVID-19 patients. Here, we investigated whether NLR levels on admission could predict the severity and mortality of COVID-19 patients.

- **Methods**: A literature search was conducted on 23 July 2020 to retrieve all published articles, including grey literature and preprints, investigating the association between on-admission NLR values and severity or mortality in COVID-19 patients. A meta-analysis was performed to determine the overall standardized mean difference (SMD) in NLR values and the pooled risk ratio (RR) for severity and mortality with the 95% Confidence Interval (95% CI).

- **Results**: A total of 38 articles, including 5,699 patients with severity outcomes and 6,033 patients with mortality outcomes, were included. The meta-analysis showed that severe and non-survivors of COVID-19 had higher on-admission NLR levels than non-severe and survivors (SMD 0.88; 95% CI 0.72–1.04; I² = 75.52% and 1.87; 95% CI 1.25–2.49; I² = 97.81%, respectively). Regardless of the different NLR cut-off values, the pooled mortality RR in patients with elevated vs. normal NLR levels was 2.74 (95% CI 0.98–7.66).

- **Conclusion**: High NLR levels on admission were associated with severe COVID-19 and mortality. Further studies need to focus on determining the optimal cut-off value for NLR before clinical use.

### Circulating markers of neutrophil extracellular traps are of prognostic value in patients with COVID-19 [^112ZqqB1]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2021). High credibility.

The full spectrum of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection ranges from asymptomatic to acute respiratory distress syndrome, characterized by hyperinflammation and thrombotic microangiopathy. The pathogenic mechanisms are poorly understood, but emerging evidence suggests that excessive neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation plays a key role in COVID-19 disease progression. We evaluate if circulating markers of NETs are associated with COVID-19 disease severity and clinical outcome, as well as with markers of inflammation, in vivo coagulation, and fibrinolysis.

One hundred six patients with COVID-19 with moderate to severe disease were enrolled shortly after hospital admission and followed for 4 months. Acute and convalescent plasma samples, as well as plasma samples from 30 healthy individuals, were assessed for markers of NET formation: citrullinated histone H3, cell-free DNA, and NE (neutrophil elastase). We found that all plasma levels of NET markers were elevated in patients with COVID-19 relative to healthy controls, they were associated with respiratory support requirement and short-term mortality, and declined to those found in healthy individuals 4 months post-infection.

The levels of the NET markers also correlated with white blood cells, neutrophils, inflammatory cytokines, and C-reactive protein, as well as with markers of in vivo coagulation, fibrinolysis, and endothelial damage. Our findings suggest a role of NETs in COVID-19 disease progression, implicating their contribution to immunothrombosis.

### Hematological abnormalities in COVID-19: A narrative review [^111Wbtu2]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2021). Low credibility.

- **White blood cell abnormalities in COVID-19**: Twenty to 40% of COVID-19 patients have leucopenia, and 3–24% have leukocytosis. Lymphopenia (lymphocyte count ≤ 1,100 cells/μL) was seen in 30–75% of COVID-19 patients. A meta-analysis performed by Huan and Pranata found a strong association between lymphopenia and severe COVID-19. CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes are predominantly reduced in the COVID-19 patients requiring ICU care. There was increased expression of PD-1 and Tim-3 in surviving T cells, suggesting functional exhaustion. Neutrophilia has been reported in severe COVID-19 patients. An elevated neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio was identified as a marker for in-hospital mortality and severe COVID-19 disease. Reactive lymphocytes have been described in many viral infections including COVID-19. Reactive lymphocyte and antibody-secreting lymphocytes identified based on automated hematology analyzer scattergrams were shown to rise toward the second week of infection. Although not many studies have commented on changes in eosinophil counts in COVID-19, Zhang et al. found 52.9% of COVID-19 patients to have reduced eosinophils count.

- **Neutrophil and platelet morphological changes**: Zini et al. found morphological changes in neutrophils, such as abnormal shape of the nucleus and cytoplasmic granulation, and in platelets, including hyperchromatic forms. Apoptotic and immature granulocytes were observed in the peripheral blood smear and may be due to the perturbation of normal granulopoiesis. The cytokine storm and hyperinflammation were proposed as possible causal factors for these changes.

### A systematic meta-analysis of immune signatures in patients with COVID-19 [^1125XPUS]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2021). Low credibility.

- **Neutrophils, monocytes, eosinophils, basophils, and COVID-19 severity**: About 124 studies on the evaluation of neutrophils, monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils cells between severe and non-severe COVID-19 patients were included. As shown in Figure S5, the neutrophil cell count and neutrophil cell ratio in the severe group were significantly higher than those in the non-severe group with standardized mean differences (SMDs) of 0.72 (95% CI, 0.61–0.82; p < 0.01; Figure S5a) and 0.62 (95% CI, 0.35–0.88; p < 0.01; Figure S5b), respectively. The monocyte cell ratio and eosinophil cell count were significantly lower in severe patients compared to non-severe patients with SMDs of −0.36 (95% CI, −0.51 to −0.21; p < 0.01; Figure S5c) and −0.45 (95% CI, −0.59 to −0.31; p < 0.01; Figure S5d), while the monocyte cell count and basophil cell count were comparable between the two groups with SMDs of −0.06 (95% CI, −0.15 to 0.04; p = 0.24; Figure S5e) and −0.14 (95% CI, −0.43 to 0.15; p = 0.34; Figure S5f), respectively.

- **Sub-analysis of only peer-reviewed studies**: The sub-analysis considering only peer-reviewed studies for each immune mediator was performed, and the results were presented in Table 2, but without obvious difference from those of all the included literature analyzed.

### Delayed, transient and self-resolving neutropenia following COVID-19 pneumonia [^113zzsx5]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

A novel coronavirus, identified as SARS-CoV-2, spread throughout the world in 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to many discoveries and clinical manifestations. A young patient is presented with new, self-resolving neutropenia, emerging weeks following a prolonged hospital stay for COVID-19 pneumonia. Workup included analysis for underlying infection, nutritional abnormalities, malignancy, medication, and toxin exposure, all of which were negative. From 2020 to the present, few reports have described neutropenia associated with a recent COVID-19 infection. In particular, no reports have described a delayed presentation of neutropenia. The authors propose that the significant inflammatory response associated with COVID-19 likely led to this patient's postviral neutropenia. Furthermore, in young healthy patients, bone marrow biopsy may be deferred and a watchful-waiting approach may be adopted to assess for neutropenia resolution.

### Differential white blood cell count in the COVID-19: A cross-sectional study of 148 patients [^112zJpTH]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2020). Low credibility.

SARS-CoV-2 infection alters various blood parameters, which may indicate disease severity and thus help in better clinical management.

- **Aim**: To study the association between various hematological parameters and the disease severity of COVID-19. Additionally, to analyze the effects of hypertension and diabetes on the neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and neutrophil-monocyte ratio (NMR) in patients suffering from COVID-19.

- **Materials and methods**: The study was a cross-sectional study involving 148 laboratory-confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The patients were divided into three groups based on disease severity. Various hematological parameters were analyzed. The effects of hypertension and diabetes on NLR and NMR in COVID-19 patients were evaluated.

- **Results**: Of the 148 patients, 78.4%, 8.1%, and 13.5% were in the mild, moderate, and severe groups, respectively. The mean age was 42.63 ± 16.04 years (IQR: 29, 54.75; Range: 7–74). A total of 58.8% of patients were male, while the rest (42.2%) were female. The mean total leukocyte count (TLC, cells/mm³), neutrophil (%), lymphocyte (%), monocyte (%), eosinophil (%), NLR, and NMR among mild, moderate, and severe COVID-19 cases were statistically significant (p < 0.05). Basophil (%) and lymphocyte-monocyte ratio (LMR) were statistically insignificant among the three groups. Lymphocyte (%), monocyte (%), and eosinophil (%) were negatively correlated with disease severity. Among diabetics, both NLR and NMR were statistically significant (p < 0.05). However, among hypertensive cases, only the NLR was statistically significant.

### Dysregulation of the immune response affects the outcome of critical COVID-19 patients [^113agowb]. Journal of Medical Virology (2020). Low credibility.

Critical cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are associated with a high risk of mortality. It remains unclear why patients with the same critical condition have different outcomes. We aimed to explore relevant factors that may affect the prognosis of critical COVID-19 patients. Six critical COVID-19 inpatients were included in our study. The six patients were divided into two groups based on whether they had a good or poor prognosis.

We collected peripheral blood samples at admission and the time point of exacerbation to compare differences in the phenotypes and functions of major populations of immune cells between the groups. On admission, compared to patients with poor prognoses, those with good prognoses had significantly higher counts of monocytes (p < 0.05), macrophages (p < 0.05), higher frequency of CD3 + CD4 + CD45RO + CXCR3 + subsets (p < 0.05), higher frequency of CD14 + CD11C + HLA-DR + subset of dendritic cells (p < 0.05), and a lower count of neutrophils (p < 0.05).

At the time point of exacerbation, the proportions of naïve CD4 + T cells (p < 0.05), Tregs, and Th2 cells in the poor prognosis group were relatively higher than those in the good prognosis group, and CD4 + memory T cells were relatively lower (p < 0.05). According to our results, the poor prognosis group showed a worse immune response than the good prognosis group at the time of admission and at exacerbation. Dysregulation of the immune response affects the outcome of critical COVID-19 patients.

### Whole blood immunophenotyping uncovers immature neutrophil-to-VD2 T-cell ratio as an early marker for severe COVID-19 [^112gWUAM]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) first appeared in Wuhan, China, in late 2019. It is a novel pathogen responsible for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. COVID-19 patients experience a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations ranging from low-grade fever and mild respiratory symptoms to more severe forms, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which requires supplemental oxygen provision and, in some cases, intubation and mechanical ventilation. The majority of critical COVID-19 cases are associated with coagulopathy, with a high prevalence of thromboembolic events in patients under mechanical ventilation, leading to the inclusion of anticoagulation therapies in the standard of care for severe COVID-19 cases. While the strong inflammatory response to COVID-19 is proposed to be associated with COVID-19-related coagulopathy, it remains unclear how SARS-CoV-2 infection affects the activation of immune cells and their contribution to the severity of disease outcomes in patients.

Previous clinical studies reported associations with clinical blood counts, while others specifically assessed T-cell subsets for activation and exhaustion markers. Since strong evidence points to a cytokine storm as the culprit for disease severity, various groups have investigated cytokine-secreting pathogenic T-cells and inflammatory monocytes that could have triggered this phenomenon. In addition, flow cytometry analysis in COVID-19 patients has also shown a polarization towards the Th17 subtype.

### Monocyte-driven atypical cytokine storm and aberrant neutrophil activation as key mediators of COVID-19 disease severity [^116wWGoc]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Epidemiological and clinical reports indicate that SARS-CoV-2 virulence hinges upon the triggering of an aberrant host immune response more than on direct virus-induced cellular damage. To elucidate the immunopathology underlying COVID-19 severity, we perform cytokine and multiplex immune profiling in COVID-19 patients. We show that hypercytokinemia in COVID-19 differs from the interferon-gamma-driven cytokine storm in macrophage activation syndrome and is more pronounced in critical versus mild-moderate COVID-19.

Systems modelling of cytokine levels paired with deep-immune profiling shows that classical monocytes drive this hyper-inflammatory phenotype and that a reduction in T-lymphocytes correlates with disease severity, with CD8+ cells being disproportionately affected. Antigen presenting machinery expression is also reduced in critical disease. Furthermore, we report that neutrophils contribute to disease severity and local tissue damage by amplification of hypercytokinemia and the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps. Together, our findings suggest a myeloid-driven immunopathology, in which hyperactivated neutrophils and an ineffective adaptive immune system act as mediators of COVID-19 disease severity.

### Eosinophil responses during COVID-19 infections and coronavirus vaccination [^113Dcv2Y]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). High credibility.

Eosinophils are circulating and tissue-resident leukocytes with potent pro-inflammatory effects in numerous diseases. Recently, they have been identified to perform various functions, including immunoregulation and antiviral activity. Eosinophil levels can vary dramatically in several clinical settings, especially after eosinophil-targeted therapy, which selectively depletes these cells.

- **Key COVID-19-related questions concerning eosinophils**: There are important considerations for recommended prevention and care. First, do patients with eosinophilia-associated diseases experience an altered course of COVID-19? Second, do patients with eosinopenia, now intentionally induced by biological drugs, have unique COVID-19 susceptibility and/or disease course? Eosinopenia is associated with acute respiratory deterioration during infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, the causative agent of COVID-19. Third, do eosinophils contribute to lung pathology during COVID-19, and could they contribute to immunopotentiation associated with emerging COVID-19 vaccines?

This paper addresses these timely questions and projects considerations during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

### Temporal changes of haematological and radiological findings of the COVID-19 infection-a review of literature [^112C7rRN]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

With time progression, peripheral blood results reflect worsening lymphopenia and more significant elevations in CRP and LDH, as well as increased neutrophil counts. Temporal changes also show a decrease in the frequency of GGO, in contrast to increasing consolidation and crazy paving patterns on chest CT imaging. The lesion distribution in early-phase disease already appears extensive and continues to cause more lung involvement over time. These findings suggest a positive correlation between temporal progression, disease severity, and the reported blood and radiology results. Awareness of these trends in blood results and imaging changes may assist clinicians in making ICU admission decisions when resources are limited.

### Neutrophilic myeloid-derived suppressor cells and severity in SARS-CoV-2 infection [^11539ui6]. Laboratory Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

While we strive to live with SARS-CoV-2, defining the immune response that leads to recovery rather than severe disease remains highly important. COVID-19 has been associated with inflammation and a profoundly suppressed immune response.

- **Objective**: To study myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), which are potent immunosuppressive cells, in SARS-CoV-2 infection.

- **Results**: Patients with severe and critical COVID-19 showed higher frequencies of neutrophilic (PMN)-MDSCs than patients with moderate illness and control individuals (P = 0.005). Severe disease in individuals older and younger than 60 years was associated with distinct PMN-MDSC frequencies, being predominantly higher in patients of 60 years of age and younger (P = 0.004). However, both age groups showed comparable inflammatory markers. In our analysis for the prediction of poor outcome during hospitalization, MDSCs were not associated with an increased risk of death. Still, patients older than 60 years (odds ratio [OR] = 5.625; p = 0.02) with preexisting medical conditions (OR = 2.818; p = 0.003) showed more severe disease and worse outcomes. Among the immunological parameters, increased C-reactive protein (OR = 1.015; p = 0.04) and lymphopenia (OR = 5.958; p = 0.04) strongly identified patients with poor prognosis.

- **Conclusion**: PMN-MDSCs are associated with disease severity in COVID-19; however, MDSC levels do not predict an increased risk of death during hospitalization.

### Eosinopenia and elevated C-reactive protein facilitate triage of COVID-19 patients in fever clinic: A retrospective case-control study [^116pEhjg]. EClinicalMedicine (2020). Low credibility.

Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is currently a pandemic affecting over 200 countries. Many cities have established designated fever clinics to triage suspected COVID-19 patients from other patients with similar symptoms. However, given the limited availability of the nucleic acid test, as well as the long waiting time for both the test and radiographic examination, the quarantine or therapeutic decisions for a large number of mixed patients were often not made in time. We aimed to identify simple and quickly available laboratory biomarkers to facilitate effective triage at the fever clinics for sorting suspected COVID-19 patients from those with COVID-19-like symptoms.

- **Methods**: We collected clinical, etiological, and laboratory data of 989 patients who visited the Fever Clinic at Wuhan Union Hospital, Wuhan, China, from Jan 31 to Feb 21. Based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) nucleic acid testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection, they were divided into two groups: SARS-CoV-2-positive patients as cases and SARS-CoV-2-negative patients as controls. We compared the clinical features and laboratory findings of the two groups, analyzed the diagnostic performance of several laboratory parameters in predicting SARS-CoV-2 infection, and made relevant comparisons to the China diagnosis guideline of having a normal or decreased number of leukocytes (≤ 9.5 × 10⁹/L) or lymphopenia (< 1.1 × 10⁹/L).

- **Findings**: Normal or decreased number of leukocytes (≤ 9.5 × 10⁹/L), lymphopenia (< 1.1 × 10⁹/L), eosinopenia (< 0.02 × 10⁹/L) were noted among the patients.

### Temporal changes of haematological and radiological findings of the COVID-19 infection-a review of literature [^113xoZJT]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Further reviews can be conducted to address the limitations of this review, especially as numerous studies on COVID-19 patients from countries outside China have been published. More studies in outpatient, primary care, or community settings are needed to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the spectrum of clinical severity. Efforts should also focus on conducting similar studies in different patient populations, such as pediatric and adolescent groups.

Studies are necessary to differentiate between the laboratory and radiological manifestations of COVID-19 compared to other viruses in the same family, like SARS and MERS, as well as with other types of viral pneumonia, including influenza, parainfluenza, adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, human metapneumovirus, and mycoplasma pneumonia.

### Eosinopenia and elevated C-reactive protein facilitate triage of COVID-19 patients in fever clinic: A retrospective case-control study [^112mL3xB]. EClinicalMedicine (2020). Low credibility.

The WHO interim guidance for COVID-19 defines suspected cases based on two criteria:

1. **Clinical features**: Respiratory-infection symptoms that cannot be fully explained by other etiologies.
2. **Epidemiological features**: Affected geographic regions, travel history, or close contact with a confirmed or probable case.

In the WHO interim guidance, laboratory evidence was not required to define a suspected case. Different countries may have their own guidelines. In China, the Guidelines of the National Health Commission for COVID-19 (6th edition) were followed during this study. According to these guidelines, suspected COVID-19 cases would have the following features:

- **Recent travel history** to Wuhan City or Hubei Province or close contact with a confirmed or probable case.
- **Fever and/or respiratory symptoms**.
- **Laboratory findings** of normal or decreased number of leukocytes and/or lymphopenia.
- **Radiographic evidence** showing pneumonia.

Suspected cases were defined if they met the following criteria:

- Criterion (1) plus any two of (2), (3), (4) or three of (2), (3), (4) at the same time.

For simplicity, the two parameters listed as "normal or decreased number of leukocytes and/or lymphopenia" were referred to as one term, "Guideline", for the following analyses.

### Mechanisms involved in the development of thrombocytopenia in patients with COVID-19 [^114ujTju]. Thrombosis Research (2020). Low credibility.

Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Emerging genetic and clinical evidence suggests similarities between COVID-19 patients and those with severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome. Hematological changes such as lymphopenia and thrombocytopenia are not rare in COVID-19 patients, and a smaller population of these patients had leukopenia. Thrombocytopenia was detected in 5–41.7% of the patients with COVID-19. Analyzing the dynamic decrease in platelet counts may be useful in the prognosis of patients with COVID-19. However, the mechanisms underlying the development of thrombocytopenia remain to be elucidated. This review summarizes the hematological changes in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 and possible underlying mechanisms of thrombocytopenia development.

### Accuracy of routine laboratory tests to predict mortality and deterioration to severe or critical Covid-19 in people with SARS-CoV-2 [^114KVi5L]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Low credibility.

Seven studies (393 cases/1443 non-cases) assessed both the increase in LDH and decrease in lymphocyte count. The median specificity was 66% (IQR 49% to 69%). LDH was the reference test. The relative diagnostic odds ratio (RDOR) was 2.22 (P < 0.0001, 95% CI 1.5154 to 3.2625), indicating that a decrease in lymphocyte count had higher test accuracy compared to an increase in LDH.

- **CRP increase and NLR increase, d-dimer increase and NLR increase, LDH increase and NLR increase, lymphocyte count decrease and NLR increase**: These were not compared in a direct comparison due to fewer than four studies being available for analysis.

For the combined outcome, there were not enough studies available to perform comparisons.

Due to a scarcity of data at the time of writing, we did not investigate whether prognostic accuracy varied according to specific measurement or test, reference standard, baseline severity, timing of outcome verification, sample type, study design, and setting, including prevalence of the target condition. Moreover, we were not able to assess the difference in test accuracy using likelihood ratio tests for comparisons of models with and without covariate terms, because fewer than 10 primary studies were available for the direct comparisons. We did not have enough data available to investigate the following sources of heterogeneity: measurement technique or test type, reference standard, timing of outcome verification, sample type, study design, and setting, including prevalence of the target condition. Furthermore, there were insufficient data available to perform sensitivity analyses considering the impact of unpublished studies.

### Interleukin-6, procalcitonin and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio: Potential immune-inflammatory parameters to identify severe and fatal forms of COVID-19 [^112R6z5Y]. Cytokine (2021). Low credibility.

Accumulating evidence supports that the viral-induced hyper-inflammatory immune response plays a central role in COVID-19 pathogenesis. It might be involved in the progression to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multi-organ failure leading to death. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of immune-inflammatory biomarkers in COVID-19 and determine optimal thresholds for assessing severe and fatal forms of this disease.

A total of 153 patients with confirmed COVID-19 were included in this study and classified into non-severe and severe groups. Plasmatic levels of interleukin 6 (IL-6), C-reactive protein (CRP), soluble-IL2 receptor (IL-2Rα), procalcitonin (PCT), and ferritin were measured using a chemiluminescence assay. A complete blood count was performed using the Convergys 3X® hematology analyzer.

Our results demonstrated that peripheral blood levels of IL-6, PCT, CRP, ferritin, IL-2Rα, white blood cell count (WBC), neutrophil count (NEU), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and derived neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (d-NLR) were significantly higher in severe forms of COVID-19.

- **ROC curve analysis**: IL-6 was identified as the most accurate inflammatory biomarker. The calculated cutoff for IL-6 (42 pg/ml) could correctly classify more than 90% of patients regarding their risk of severity (area under the ROC curve (AUROC) = 0.972). The threshold value of 83 pg/ml was highly predictive of progression to death (AUROC = 0.94, OR = 184) following a median of 3 days.

Additionally, IL-6 was positively correlated with other inflammatory markers. The kinetic analysis highlighted its val…

### Effects of tuberculosis and/or HIV-1 infection on COVID-19 presentation and immune response in Africa [^116jQ9jy]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

We have provided one of the first accounts of the clinical presentation and laboratory features of COVID-19 in an African setting, which has high prevalence of both non-communicable and communicable diseases, such as HIV-1 and tuberculosis. An important conclusion is that the triple occurrence of SARS-CoV-2, HIV-1, and tuberculosis is not uncommon. Clinical features may be dominated by either SARS-CoV-2 or tuberculosis; although overall radiographic severity may be modulated, lymphopenia is exacerbated, and some markers of inflammation are even more elevated in such patients. Notably, forty percent of patients with coincident COVID-19 and tuberculosis died.

Our study benefitted from the inclusion of participants admitted to the same hospital during the surge in COVID-19 admissions who were subsequently assigned alternative diagnoses with negative virological and serological tests for SARS-CoV-2. A limitation is that this is not a formal control group (or reported as such), and we cannot exclude that such tests were false negatives under the circumstances. In addition, their ordinal score, which is dominated by the need for and type of respiratory support, was lower. It could be argued that differences in biomarkers may relate to severity and may not be specific to SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, the existence of this group allowed us to compare blood markers used to characterize and prognosticate SARS-CoV-2 infection. We found that neither raised total white count, neutrophilia, nor lymphopenia can be inferred as specific for COVID-19.

### Hematological findings and complications of COVID-19 [^113f1NYB]. American Journal of Hematology (2020). Low credibility.

COVID-19 is a systemic infection with a significant impact on the hematopoietic system and hemostasis. Lymphopenia may be considered a cardinal laboratory finding with prognostic potential. The neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio and peak platelet/lymphocyte ratio may also have prognostic value in determining severe cases. During the disease course, longitudinal evaluation of lymphocyte count dynamics and inflammatory indices, including LDH, CRP, and IL-6, may help identify cases with a dismal prognosis and prompt intervention to improve outcomes. Biomarkers, such as high serum procalcitonin and ferritin, have also emerged as poor prognostic factors.

Furthermore, blood hypercoagulability is common among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Elevated D-Dimer levels are consistently reported, and their gradual increase during the disease course is particularly associated with disease worsening. Other coagulation abnormalities, such as PT and aPTT prolongation and fibrin degradation products increase, with severe thrombocytopenia, lead to life-threatening disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), which necessitates continuous vigilance and prompt intervention. Therefore, COVID-19 infected patients, whether hospitalized or ambulatory, are at high risk for venous thromboembolism, and early and prolonged pharmacological thromboprophylaxis with low molecular weight heparin is highly recommended. Lastly, the need for ensuring blood donations during the pandemic is also highlighted.

### A systematic review of clinical and laboratory parameters associated with increased severity among COVID-19 patients [^113jkBib]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2021). Low credibility.

Corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been an extremely difficult pandemic to contain and it has affected more than 148 countries worldwide. The main aim of this systematic review is to provide a comprehensive summary of clinical and laboratory parameters that are associated with and indicative of increased severity among COVID-19 patients.

- **Material and methods**: All the available data from high-quality research articles relevant to the epidemiology, demographics, trends in hospitalization and outcomes, clinical signs and symptoms, diagnostic methods, and treatment methods of COVID-19 were retrieved and evaluated for inclusion.

- **Results**: As per our review, the mean age of patients in the severe group was 59.3 years compared to 46.5 years in the non-severe group. COVID-19 was more severe among men than women. Clinical presentation was variable among different studies, and dyspnea was the factor indicating severe disease. Laboratory parameters associated with increased severity were lymphopenia 11 × 10⁹/L, procalcitonin > 0.5 ng/mL, D-dimer > 2 mcg/mL, aspartate transaminase elevation > 150 U/L, and LDH > 250 U/L.

- **Conclusion**: This systematic review suggests that COVID-19 is a disease with varied clinical presentation and laboratory parameters. The most common clinical symptoms were fever, cough, and dyspnea. The laboratory parameters associated with severe disease were lymphopenia, elevated LDH, D-dimer, and procalcitonin.

### Hematological abnormalities in COVID-19: A narrative review [^115b7KoX]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2021). Low credibility.

Lymphocytopenia is significantly more common in patients with severe COVID-19. Non-survivors had a lower lymphocyte count and higher prothrombin time than survivors. Antibody synthesizing lymphocytes, as a percentage of total lymphocytes, were also shown to be predictive of severe disease. D-dimer level is the most useful and consistent marker for identifying COVID-19 disease severity. Yao et al. found a D-dimer level of > 2.14 mg/L to predict hospital mortality, with a sensitivity of 88.2% and specificity of 71.3%.

### Comparison of blood counts and markers of inflammation and coagulation in patients with and without COVID-19 presenting to the emergency department in Seattle, WA [^113QvZ3S]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2021). Low credibility.

We compared complete blood count (CBC) with differential and markers of inflammation and coagulation in patients with and without coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) presenting to emergency departments in Seattle, WA.

- **Methods**: We reviewed laboratory values for 1 week following each COVID-19 test for adult patients who received a standard severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test before April 13, 2020. Results were compared by COVID-19 status and clinical course.

- **Results**: In total, 1,027 patients met inclusion criteria. Patients with COVID-19 (n = 155) had lower leukocytes (P < .0001), lymphocytes (P < .0001), and platelets (P < .0001), and higher hemoglobin (P = 0.0140) than those without, but absolute differences were small. Serum albumin was lower in patients with COVID-19 (P < .0001), and serum albumin, neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and red cell distribution width (RDW) were each associated with disease severity. NLR did not differ between patients with COVID-19 and those without (P = 0.8012).

- **Conclusions**: Patients with COVID-19 had modestly lower leukocyte, lymphocyte, and platelet counts and higher hemoglobin values than patients without COVID-19. The NLR, serum albumin, and RDW varied with disease severity, regardless of COVID-19 status.

### The value of clinical parameters in predicting the severity of COVID-19 [^117FJBQb]. Journal of Medical Virology (2020). Low credibility.

To study the relationship between clinical indexes and the severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and to explore its role in predicting the severity of COVID-19, clinical data of 443 patients with COVID-19 admitted to our hospital were retrospectively analyzed. Patients were divided into nonsevere group (n = 304) and severe group (n = 139) according to their condition. Clinical indicators were compared between different groups. The differences in sex, age, the proportion of patients with combined heart disease, leukocyte, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), neutrophil, lymphocyte, platelet, D-dimer, C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin, lactate dehydrogenase, and albumin on admission between the two groups were statistically significant (p < 0.05).

Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that NLR and CRP were independent risk factors for severe COVID-19. Platelets were independent protective factors for severe COVID-19. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis demonstrated that the area under the curve for NLR, platelet, CRP, and combination was 0.737, 0.634, 0.734, and 0.774, respectively. NLR, CRP, and platelets can effectively assess the severity of COVID-19, among which NLR is the best predictor of severe COVID-19. The combination of these three clinical indicators can further predict severe COVID-19.

### Distinguishing between COVID-19 and influenza during the early stages by measurement of peripheral blood parameters [^113JKKAj]. Journal of Medical Virology (2021). Low credibility.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection. This study aims to examine the changes in peripheral blood parameters during the early stages of COVID-19 and influenza. We analyzed the peripheral blood parameters of 169 COVID-19 patients and 131 influenza patients during the early-onset stage. Results from the patients with COVID-19 were compared with those from healthy controls and influenza patients. In addition, results from patients with common and severe COVID-19 were further compared.

There were significant differences between COVID-19 and influenza patients in terms of age, white blood cell count, platelet count, percentage of neutrophils, percentage of lymphocytes, percentage of monocytes, percentage of eosinophils, percentage of basophils, neutrophil count, and monocyte count. Two parameters (monocyte count and percentage of basophils) were combined to clarify the diagnostic efficacy of COVID-19 and influenza, and the area under the curve was found to be 0.772.

Comparison of peripheral blood parameters from common COVID-19, severe COVID-19, and influenza patients revealed many differences during the early disease stages. The diagnostic formula developed by this study will be of benefit for physicians in differentiating COVID-19 and influenza.

### Comparison of clinical characteristics and peripheral blood tests of COVID-19 and influenza B patients [^114yFZ2F]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2023). High credibility.

Blood cell analysis is one of the most commonly used primary screening tools in clinical practice, where leukocytes, neutrophils, and lymphocytes can promptly reflect disease pathology and immune status. In this study, more than 95% of patients in both groups had normal or low white blood cell counts on the day of clinic visit. The leukocyte and neutrophil counts were higher in patients with COVID-19 than in those with influenza B, whereas the lymphocyte count was lower. This result is consistent with the diagnostic reference standards for both diseases and is identical to the results of clinical studies. Additionally, we found that red blood cells plummeted in COVID-19 patients. Early cases of COVID-19 also showed reduced bone marrow hematopoietic cell counts.

### Covid-19 and hematopoietic cell transplantation center-specific survival analysis: Can we adjust for the impact of the pandemic? Recommendations of the Covid-19 Task Force of the 2020 Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplantation Research Center Outcomes Forum [^1141g5xx]. Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (2021). Low credibility.

Covid-19 has significantly impacted the practice of hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) and likely affected outcomes of HCT recipients. Early reports document substantially higher case fatality rates for HCT recipients than those faced by the general population. Currently, we do not have a clear picture of how much of this threat is present within the first year after HCT and how infection rates and outcomes vary with time after HCT. These factors are important because center-specific survival estimates for reporting purposes focus on 1-year post-HCT mortality.

Transplantation centers have dramatically changed their practices in response to the pandemic. At many centers, quality assurance processes and procedures were disrupted, and these changes likely affected team performance. Centers have been affected unevenly by the pandemic through time, location, and Covid-19 burdens. Assessment of center-specific survival depends on the ability to adjust for risk factors, such as Covid-19, that are outside center control using consistent methods so that team performance based on controllable risk factors can be ascertained.

The Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplantation Research (CIBMTR) convened a working group for the 2020 Center Outcomes Forum to assess the impact of Covid-19 on both patient-specific risks and center-specific performance. This committee reviewed the factors at play and developed recommendations for a process to determine whether adjustments in the methodology to assess center-specific performance are needed.

### A comprehensive SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 review, part 2: Host extracellular to systemic effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection [^1158jTxi]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2024). Low credibility.

**Immune adaptations and changes**: The immune system includes the innate and adaptive immune systems. The innate system involves nonspecific responses to injury and includes cell populations such as monocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, basophils, and eosinophils. The adaptive immune system involves a specific response to pathogen infection and includes cell populations such as T and B cells. The two arms of the immune system communicate, interact, and support each other in responding to injury, aided by humoral circulating factors such as cytokines and chemokines, that provide information and context to immune cells on how, where, and what to respond to, as well as the magnitude of the response. In turn, there are various feedback loops that provide guidance and direction to the immune system, both innate and adaptive, with SARS-CoV-2 activating both the innate and adaptive immune systems.

### Distinct clinical and immunological profiles of patients with evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in sub-Saharan Africa [^1145vTCd]. Nature Communications (2021). Low credibility.

Some of the major features of severe COVID-19 are lymphopenia and neutrophilia in the systemic circulation. As such, the neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio has been shown to have prognostic value, predicting those at high risk of severe disease or death. However, the mechanisms behind lymphopenia and neutrophilia during COVID-19 are still not well understood.

Interestingly, in our study, concentrations of IL-3 and Flt-3L were distinctively altered in severe COVID-19 participants compared to non-COVID-19 SARI participants. Specifically, in severe COVID-19 participants, IL-3 was detected at very high levels in the nasal lining fluid, while Flt-3L was repressed in serum. IL-3 and Flt-3L are key cytokines involved in haematopoiesis of leukocytes. IL-3 induces expansion and generation of myeloid cells, while Flt-3L binds to Flt-3 and activates common lymphoid progenitor cells to increase the number of lymphocytes. Alterations in these cytokines in mouse models are associated with dysregulated haematopoiesis and altered leukocyte cellularity. Therefore, it is plausible that high levels of IL-3 and repressed levels of Flt-3L could contribute to the high neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio and altered leukocyte numbers observed in severe COVID-19 patients.

Due to the high HIV prevalence in our setting, we conducted an exploratory analysis of the impact of HIV co-infection on COVID-19. While data from the United Kingdom and South Africa suggests an increased risk of mortality in HIV-infected COVID-19 patients, a systematic review and data from the United States did not demonstrate this association…

### Role of platelet-to-lymphocyte count ratio (PLR), as a prognostic indicator in COVID-19: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^115v1kEK]. Journal of Medical Virology (2022). Low credibility.

Prognostic predictors are of paramount interest for prompt intervention and optimal utilization of the healthcare system in the ongoing context of the COVID-19 pandemic. The platelet-to-lymphocyte count ratio (PLR) has emerged as a potential tool for risk stratification of critically ill patients with sepsis. This systematic review explores the utility of PLR as a prognostic predictor for COVID-19 patients.

We screened electronic databases until May 15, 2021, after enrolling in PROSPERO (CRD42021220269). Studies evaluating the association between PLR on admission and outcomes in terms of mortality and severity among COVID-19 patients were included. We retrieved 32 studies, with a total of 2,768 and 3,262 COVID-19 patients for mortality and disease severity outcomes, respectively. Deceased and critically ill patients had higher PLR levels on admission in comparison to survivors and non-severe patients (mean differences [MD] = 66.10; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 47.75–84.44; p < 0.00001 and MD = 86.74; 95% CI: 67.7–105.7; p < 0.00001, respectively).

A higher level of PLR on admission in COVID-19 patients is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. However, the evidence remains of low quality, highlighting the need for further studies regarding the cut-off value of PLR.

### Characteristics of inflammatory factors and lymphocyte subsets in patients with severe COVID-19 [^117KHhxf]. Journal of Medical Virology (2020). Low credibility.

It had been reported that COVID-19 mostly affected men because immune genes are more expressed on the X chromosome. Female patients had lower levels of inflammatory factors, while CD4+ T cells were higher with a better immune response than in male patients with COVID-19. However, in our patients, except for TNF-α, most of the levels of inflammatory factors and the lymphocyte subsets were not significantly different between male and female patients. The differences in the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection between men and women need further study.

Although studies have provided evidence that cytokine storms and immunopathology can occur during pathogenic human coronavirus infections, we do not yet have a sufficient understanding of the specific factors responsible for exuberant inflammatory responses. Nonetheless, therapeutic interventions targeting these proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines could prove beneficial in ameliorating undesirable inflammatory responses.

- **Therapeutic interventions**: Corticosteroids are generally used to suppress inflammatory conditions. High-dose corticosteroids were the mainstay of immunomodulatory therapy during the SARS and MERS epidemics. Corticosteroid administration often leads to early improvements in terms of reduced fever, resolution of radiographic lung infiltrates, and better oxygenation. However, some studies have shown no beneficial effect of corticosteroids, while others have demonstrated adverse outcomes following corticosteroid therapy. Some experts believed there is no clinical data to indicate that a net benefit is derived from corticosteroids in treatment.

### Immunological imprint of COVID-19 on human peripheral blood leukocyte populations [^113vZ9Y8]. Allergy (2021). Low credibility.

Similarly, several studies have investigated the effects of a primary SARS-CoV-2 infection on leukocyte populations in the body in general, and on T and B lymphocyte subsets in particular. Also, the SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell response has been investigated by several research groups.

Notably, memory CD4+ T cells have been suggested to mediate protective immunity against the previously circulating CoV-strains, SARS-CoV, and MERS. CD8+ memory T cell responses have been observed in SARS-CoV convalescent patients years after primary infection. However, regarding infection with the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, recent reports have revealed conflicting results. One study analyzing PB lymphocyte subsets in 44 patients pointed toward reduced T memory and T regulatory cell populations in severe COVID-19-infected patients, suggesting that immune dysregulation potentially leads to aggravated inflammatory responses in patients.

In contrast, another study provided evidence for segregation between memory T cells from patients with acute severe or acute moderate COVID-19 disease and the development of memory T cells from recently convalescent individuals (42–58 days after infection) and healthy controls. The latter study found only very moderate changes in a group of 40 COVID-19 convalescent patients who underwent a mild COVID-19 disease course (49–64 days after disease onset).

### Prognostic value of leukocytosis and lymphopenia for coronavirus disease severity [^114JDbo8]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2020). Low credibility.

The incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), has spread rapidly globally; as of March 29, 2020, approximately 670,000 cases had been confirmed worldwide. COVID-19 is typically a pulmonary infection that can range from mild illness to acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiple organ failure. However, other symptoms such as myalgias and anorexia have been noted. Although many ongoing studies are investigating the measurement of proinflammatory cytokines and other biomarkers as a way to prognosticate infection severity, we investigated the use of two easily obtained predictors: lymphopenia and leukocytosis.

### Prognostic value of leukocytosis and lymphopenia for coronavirus disease severity [^111Ge6pq]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2020). Low credibility.

Pooled data across early studies validate a significant correlation between elevated leukocyte count and decreased lymphocyte count among patients with severe cases of COVID-19 compared with those with mild cases. Why lymphopenia is associated with severe illness remains unclear. It has been hypothesized that this association could result from direct lymphocyte infection, destruction of lymphatic tissue, inflammation leading to lymphocyte apoptosis, or inhibition of lymphocytes by metabolic disorders such as lactic acidosis. Lymphopenia as a marker of severity does not seem to be specific to COVID-19; it has been used to prognosticate other viral pneumonias such as influenza. Neutrophilia may be more specific to severe disease than leukocytosis, but neutrophil count was not uniformly reported across the studies included in our analysis.

Despite our findings regarding clinical characteristics of severe COVID-19, our study had several limitations. First, our literature search found an expected paucity of data surrounding this topic because published characterizations of patients with COVID-19 remain minimal. More COVID-19 data from other nations and patient populations will aid in the comparison and validation of our clinical findings. Second, we noted significant heterogeneity in both the leukocyte and lymphocyte analyses. This phenomenon probably resulted from the small sample size, limited and early data, and skewed representation of the patient population. Third, the definitions of severe cases were somewhat inconsistent across these studies.

### Covid-19 and immunomodulation in IBD [^1157cNce]. Gut (2020). Low credibility.

Various recent studies described the immune cell dysregulation in COVID-19 by using peripheral blood mononuclear cells. A study in 286 patients with severe COVID-19 demonstrated that affected individuals exhibit lower lymphocyte counts, higher neutrophil counts, and an elevated neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio, as well as decreased percentages of monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils. Neutrophilia has been suggested as a risk factor for developing ARDS and progression from ARDS to death in COVID-19. Additionally, a reduction in NK cell percentages was noted in COVID-19, while B cells were within the lower level of the normal range. Lymphocytopenia was a hallmark finding in patients with severe COVID-19 cases and was present in 83.2% of the patients on admission.

Both CD4+ and, to a lesser extent, CD8+ T-cell numbers were reduced in severe COVID-19 cases, although the CD4+/CD8+ T-cell ratio remained normal. Moreover, within the CD4+ T-cell subset, decreased numbers of effector memory T cells (CD45RO+) and regulatory T cells (CD25+CD127 low) were noted, while the percentage of naive T cells (CD45RA+) increased. The higher naïve/memory T-cell ratio in severe as compared with mild COVID-19 cases suggested marked immune cell alteration in these patients. Moreover, the suppression of regulatory T cells in severe cases indicated insufficient counterregulation of proinflammatory immune responses that may further aggravate hyperinflammation and tissue injury. With regard to B-cell activation, total levels of IgA, IgG, and IgM were similar between severe and mild COVID-19 cases, suggesting no major general differences in humoral immunity.

### Distinct immunological signatures discriminate severe COVID-19 from non-SARS-CoV-2-driven critical pneumonia [^114Vr4vR]. Immunity (2021). High credibility.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has affected more than 150 million people worldwide and resulted in over 3 million deaths as of April 2021. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent. Most individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 are either asymptomatic or experience mild, self-limiting symptoms such as fever, cough, and shortness of breath. However, approximately 8% of COVID-19 patients progress to severe complications, including pneumonia, respiratory failure, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), often requiring admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) and mechanical ventilation. Despite some clinical similarities to other severe respiratory infections that cause multi-organ failure, COVID-19 presents unique challenges. Currently, the in-ICU mortality rate remains at approximately 50%. There is an urgent need to understand how mild and severe SARS-CoV-2 infections differ and how they are distinct from other causes of severe respiratory syndromes.

Although the factors underpinning severe COVID-19 are not yet fully understood, evidence suggests that extreme respiratory distress in these patients is primarily driven by immunopathology. Multiple studies have demonstrated differences in immune cell populations in the peripheral blood of COVID-19 patients compared with healthy individuals. In particular, a marked lymphopenia is observed, accompanied by changes in lymphocyte activation and exhaustion phenotypes.

### Immunological imprint of COVID-19 on human peripheral blood leukocyte populations [^115ArJCM]. Allergy (2021). Low credibility.

SARS-CoV-2 has triggered a pandemic that is now claiming many lives. Several studies have investigated cellular immune responses in COVID-19-infected patients during disease, but little is known regarding a possible protracted impact of COVID-19 on the adaptive and innate immune system in COVID-19 convalescent patients.

- **Methods**: We used multiparametric flow cytometry to analyze whole peripheral blood samples and determined SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody levels against the S-protein, its RBD-subunit, and viral nucleocapsid in a cohort of COVID-19 convalescent patients who had mild disease approximately 10 weeks after infection (n = 109) and healthy control subjects (n = 98). Furthermore, we correlated immunological changes with clinical and demographic parameters.

- **Results**: Even ten weeks after disease, COVID-19 convalescent patients had fewer neutrophils, while their cytotoxic CD8 + T cells were activated, reflected as higher HLA-DR and CD38 expression. Multiparametric regression analyses showed that in COVID-19-infected patients, both CD3 + CD4 + and CD3 + CD8 + effector memory cells were higher, while CD25 + Foxp3 + T regulatory cells were lower. In addition, both transitional B cell and plasmablast levels were significantly elevated in COVID-19-infected patients. Fever (duration, level) correlated with numbers of central memory CD4 + T cells and anti-S and anti-RBD but not anti-NC antibody levels. Moreover, a "young immunological age", as determined by numbers of CD3 + CD45RA + CD62L + CD31 + recent thymic emigrants, was associated with a loss of sense of taste and/or smell.

### Accuracy of routine laboratory tests to predict mortality and deterioration to severe or critical COVID-19 in people with SARS-CoV-2 [^113ctwUk]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Low credibility.

For deterioration (4 studies), cut‐off values for lymphocyte count increase ranged from 3.2 to 4.8 x 10⁹ cells/L. Sensitivity in all four studies was 0%, as they did not include any true positive cases at the reported cut‐off value. Specificity ranged from 98% to 100%. The summary estimate of sensitivity was 7% (95% CI 0% to 83%) at a specificity of 99%, which was identical for the first quartile, median, and third quartile.

### Pragmatic recommendations for the use of diagnostic testing and prognostic models in hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 in low- and middle-income countries [^113v9gSh]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2021). Low credibility.

A variety of laboratory investigations may aid in the diagnosis and management of COVID-19. Some markers may predict disease severity and progression to ARDS, thromboembolic complications, or multi-organ failure. The U.S. NIH COVID-19 treatment guidelines suggest performing the following laboratory tests as part of the initial evaluation of patients with severe and critical COVID-19 disease: a complete blood count with differential, metabolic profile, and liver and renal function tests. It also advises measuring the levels of inflammatory markers, such as C-reactive protein (CRP), D-dimer, and ferritin for their prognostic values, though not part of the standard care. The WHO interim guidelines on the management of COVID-19 disease (May 27, 2020, September 11, 2020), however, do not provide guidance on specific laboratory testing in COVID-19 patients. This section attempts to address this discrepancy with a focus on resource-constrained LMIC settings.

- **Search results**: MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science were searched through the end of September 2020. The search used combinations of MeSH terms and free-text words, including "COVID-19", "coronavirus", "SARS-CoV-2", and "laboratory findings" or "laboratory abnormalities". Few of the studies originated from LMICs. The search identified two useful systematic reviews and meta-analyses but did not identify any randomized clinical studies.

- **Evidence**:
	- **Hematology**: Lymphopenia, leukocytosis, neutrophilia, and low hemoglobin predict progression toward severe COVID-19. White blood cell (WBC) and neutrophil counts predict similar outcomes.

### Temporal changes of haematological and radiological findings of the COVID-19 infection-a review of literature [^114g4Z3V]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Out of the 16 publications that reported clinical laboratory findings, 12 reported blood investigations conducted on or before the seventh day since symptom onset (date of onset, DOO ≤ 7 days). Lymphocyte counts were reported in all 12 of the studies; 9 reported neutrophil counts, 9 reported CRP levels, and 9 reported LDH levels. Blood investigations conducted after the seventh day since symptom onset (DOO > 7 days) were reported in 5 studies: 3 reported lymphocyte counts, 2 reported neutrophil counts, 3 reported CRP levels, and 2 reported LDH levels.

Furthermore, we compared the haematological and radiological findings between patients with severe and non-severe outcomes and analyzed the temporal changes of blood investigations in patients stratified by the severity of patients' outcomes.

Lymphopenia was evident in most studies, regardless of the number of days since the onset of symptoms. The mean lymphocyte count was lower for patients with DOO > 7 days compared to patients with DOO ≤ 7 days, 0.42 ± 0.30 versus 1.0 ± 0.49. For patients with DOO > 7 days, the median ranged from 0.5 to 0.9 × 10⁹/L (mean range 0.62–1.1 × 10⁹/L), with all but one study reporting medians suggestive of lymphopenia.

### Clinical significance of CBC and WBC morphology in the diagnosis and clinical course of COVID-19 infection [^111FVEMz]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2021). Low credibility.

To investigate the clinical significance of numeric and morphologic peripheral blood (PB) changes in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-positive patients in predicting the outcome, as well as to compare these changes between critically ill COVID-19-positive and COVID-19-negative patients.

- **Methods**: The study included 90 COVID-19-positive (51 intensive care unit [ICU] and 39 non-ICU) patients and 30 COVID-19-negative ICU patients. We collected CBC parameters (both standard and research) and PB morphologic findings, which were independently scored by two hematopathologists.

- **Results**: All patients with COVID-19 demonstrated striking numeric and morphologic WBC changes, which were different between mild and severe disease states. More severe disease was associated with significant neutrophilia and lymphopenia, which was intensified in critically ill patients. Abnormal WBC morphology, most pronounced in monocytes and lymphocytes, was associated with more mild disease; the changes were lost with disease progression. Between COVID-19-positive and COVID-19-negative ICU patients, significant differences in morphology-associated research parameters were indicative of changes due to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 virus, including higher RNA content in monocytes, lower RNA content in lymphocytes, and smaller hypogranular neutrophils.

- **Conclusions**: Hospitalized patients with COVID-19 should undergo a comprehensive daily CBC with manual WBC differential to monitor for numerical and morphologic changes predictive of poor outcome and signs of disease progression.

### Accuracy of routine laboratory tests to predict mortality and deterioration to severe or critical COVID-19 in people with SARS-CoV-2 [^115kXKmL]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). High credibility.

White blood cell count decrease was assessed for the target conditions: mortality and deterioration.

- **Mortality (5 studies)**: Four studies used a cut-off value of 4 x 10⁹ cells/L, and one study used 5.025 x 10⁹ cells/L. Sensitivity ranged from 0% to 40%, and specificity from 39% to 97%. At a fixed specificity of 68% (Q1), 83% (median), and 87% (Q3), the summary estimates of sensitivity were 9% (95% CI 6% to 14%), 9% (95% CI 6% to 14%), and 9% (95% CI 6% to 14%), respectively.

- **Deterioration (6 studies)**: The cut-off values ranged from 3.5 to 4 x 10⁹ cells/L. Sensitivity ranged from 0% to 43%; two studies reported a sensitivity of 0%. Specificity ranged from 37% to 91%. Meta-analysis yielded a sensitivity of 15% (95% CI 6% to 33%), 12% (95% CI 5% to 26%), and 8% (95% CI) at a fixed specificity of 83% (Q1), 85% (median), and 88% (Q3), respectively.

Neutrophil count increase was evaluated for deterioration in 5 studies. Cut-off values to define neutrophil count increase ranged between 4.7 and 10 x 10⁹ cells/L. Sensitivity varied from 17% to 62%, and specificity from 70% to 93%. The median specificity in these studies was 89%, with an interquartile range from 88% to 93%. The summary estimates of sensitivity corresponding to these specificities were: 62% (95% CI 46% to 75%) at a specificity of 88%, 49% (95% CI 37% to 62%) at a specificity of 89%, and 41% (95% CI 28% to 55%) at a specificity of 93%.

### Early decrease in blood lymphocyte count is associated with poor prognosis in COVID-19 patients: a retrospective cohort study [^116C8498]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is the most severe infectious disease outbreak this century, causing millions of infections and deaths worldwide. While the pandemic has primarily abated in many regions, seasonal epidemics and periodic pandemics remain a constant threat and cause significant mortality. COVID-19 infection can still cause many complications, some of which may deteriorate and even result in death, especially in high-risk patients. Therefore, early identification of high-risk patients is crucial to ensure prompt and appropriate treatment for COVID-19 patients.

Dysregulation of the immune system is directly linked to disease severity in COVID-19 patients. Immunocompromised individuals are at increased risk for COVID-19-associated mortality due to immunologic deficits that limit the virus's clearance. Zhao et al. reported that neutrophilia, lymphocytopenia, low CD4+ T cells, and decreased C3 could predict the mortality of COVID-19 patients. A meta-analysis reported that lymphocyte count reduction correlated with illness severity in COVID-19 patients. Although several studies have investigated the relationship between lymphocyte count and severity in COVID-19 patients, there is still limited information on the dynamic changes in lymphocyte count over time in COVID-19 patients, which is more important for determining patients' conditions. In the present study, we aim to investigate the trends of lymphocyte count during the progression of the disease in COVID-19 patients.

### Clinical utility of haematological inflammatory biomarkers in predicting 30-day mortality in hospitalised adult patients with COVID-19 [^1137f4pk]. British Journal of Haematology (2023). High credibility.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a multisystem disease affecting the respiratory, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, neurological, immunological, and haematological systems. The most important indices that have been studied are platelet (PLT) indices, in addition to the PLT count and red blood cell distribution width (RDW). This retrospective study included 95 patients with COVID-19 and was conducted at the Hospital Isolation, Scientific and Medical Research Centre, and Clinical Pathology Department at Zagazig University Hospitals, Egypt over a period of six months from March to August 2021.

All patients on admission underwent a full blood count, which included white blood cell (WBC) count, haemoglobin, RDW, PLT count and its indices, as well as the PLT-to-WBC ratio (PWR) and PLT-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), which were calculated for all the study patients. There were significant linear correlations for higher levels of the PLR, PWR, and RDW with mortality rate (p = 0.03, p < 0.001, and p < 0.001, respectively). Moreover, on multivariable analysis, the RDW, PLT count, and PWR levels were independent prognostic predictors for mortality with a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.25 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.09–1.44, p = 0.002), 1.00 (95% CI 0.99–1.00, p = 0.03), and 2.3 (95% CI 1.21–4.48, p = 0.01), respectively. The RDW and PLT indices are accessible predictors that can be valuable prognostic factors for survival assessment and risk stratification of COVID-19.

### Predictors of COVID-19 severity: A literature review [^116QZMpk]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2021). Low credibility.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a rapidly evolving global emergency that continues to strain healthcare systems. Emerging research describes a plethora of patient factors — including demographic, clinical, immunologic, hematological, biochemical, and radiographic findings — that may be of utility to clinicians to predict COVID-19 severity and mortality. We present a synthesis of the literature pertaining to factors predictive of COVID-19 clinical course and outcomes.

Findings associated with increased disease severity and/or mortality include age greater than 55 years, multiple pre-existing comorbidities, hypoxia, specific computed tomography findings indicative of extensive lung involvement, diverse laboratory test abnormalities, and biomarkers of end-organ dysfunction. Hypothesis-driven research is critical to identify the key evidence-based prognostic factors that will inform the design of intervention studies to improve the outcomes of patients with COVID-19 and to appropriately allocate scarce resources.

### Routine laboratory testing to determine if a patient has COVID-19 [^117Bzj16]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Low credibility.

Fifteen studies (1262 cases/5318 non-cases) reported on white blood cell count increase. The cut-off values for an increase in white blood cell count varied from 9.5 x 10⁹ cells/L to 11.2 x 10⁹ cells/L, with the exception of one study that used a cut-off value of 6.4 x 10⁹ cells/L. The median prevalence of COVID-19 in the 12 single-gate studies that reported on white blood cell count increase was 36% (IQR 25% to 50%).

Summary ROC plot of tests: 1: white blood cell count (WBC) increase; 2: WBC decrease.

Sensitivity in the 15 included studies ranged from 0% to 73%. Fourteen studies had a sensitivity within the range of 0% to 13%, while one study reported a sensitivity of 73%. This outlier was also the only study that used the lower cut-off of 6.4 x 10⁹ cells/L. Specificity ranged from 54% to 96%. The median specificity was 85%, with the interquartile range from 78% (Q1) to 92% (Q3).

The summary estimate of sensitivity according to the HSROC model, corresponding with a specificity of 78%, was 12% (95% CI 4% to 31%). The summary estimate of sensitivity corresponding with the median specificity of 85% was 6% (95% CI 2% to 17%), and the summary estimate of sensitivity corresponding with a specificity of 92% was 2% (95% CI 0% to 8%).

### Predicting disease severity and outcome in COVID-19 patients: A review of multiple biomarkers [^116B9DEw]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

An abundance of clinical reports focused on specific laboratory parameters have been reported on coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19), but a systematic analysis synthesizing these findings has not been performed.

- **Objective**: To review and summarize the available literature on the predictive role of various biomarkers in COVID-19 patients.

- **Data sources**: A literature search was performed using databases including PubMed, medRxiv, and bioRxiv. A total of 72 papers were reviewed, including 54 peer-reviewed papers and 18 non-peer-reviewed preprints.

- **Conclusions**: Although the markers are considered nonspecific, acute-phase reactants, including C-reactive protein (CRP), ferritin, serum amyloid A (SAA), and procalcitonin, were reported as sensitive markers of acute COVID-19 disease. Significantly elevated white blood cell count; marked lymphopenia; decreased CD3, CD4, or CD8 T-lymphocyte counts; high neutrophil count; thrombocytopenia; and markedly elevated inflammatory biomarkers were associated with severe disease and the risk of developing sepsis with rapid progression.

Trends observed by serial laboratory measurements during hospitalization, including progressive decrease of lymphocyte count, thrombocytopenia, elevated CRP, procalcitonin, increased liver enzymes, decreased renal function, and coagulation derangements were more common in critically ill patient groups and associated with a high incidence of clinical complications. Elevated interleukin 6 level and markedly increased SAA were most often reported in severely and critically ill patients.

### Early predictors of mortality for moderate to severely ill patients with Covid-19 [^1149Yio9]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Determining the factors affecting the mortality and clinical conditions of patients with Covid-19 is indispensable in developing patient treatment algorithms. We aimed to determine the parameters that can predict the mortality of moderate to severely ill patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19.

- **Methods**: Moderate to severely ill Covid-19 patients older than 18 years were included. Mild Covid-19 patients and those with negative polymerase chain reaction test results were excluded from the study. The primary outcome of the study was the 30-day mortality rate, and we aimed to determine the factors affecting mortality in moderate to severely ill Covid-19 patients.

- **Results**: 168 patient results were analyzed. The median age of the patients was 59.5 (48.3 to 76) years, and 90 (53.6%) were male. According to multivariate regression analysis results, the presence of any comorbid disease (p = 0.027, HR = 26.11 (95% CI: 1.45 to 471.31)), elevated C-reactive protein levels (CRP) (p < 0.001, HR = 1.24 (95% CI: 1.11 to 1.38)), and presence of dyspnea (p = 0.026, HR = 4.26 (95% CI: 1.19 to 15.28)) were found to significantly increase mortality, while high pulse O2 saturation level (p < 0.001, HR = 0.90 (95% CI: 0.82 to 0.99)) was found to decrease it. When receiver operating characteristic curve was created for laboratory tests, it was determined that white blood cell counts, neutrophil counts, CRP levels, and neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio predicted mortality, while lymphocyte levels did not.

- **Conclusion**: Dyspnea, the presence of any comorbid disease, elevated CRP levels, and low O2 saturation levels were significant predictors of mortality in moderate to severely ill Covid-19 patients.

### Hematological abnormalities in COVID-19: A narrative review [^112KVoKz]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2021). Low credibility.

COVID-19 is caused by SARS-CoV-2. It is currently a pandemic, and as of December 2, 2020, there have been more than 64 million cases worldwide and less than 1.5 million deaths. Moreover, this has significantly impacted healthcare systems, socioeconomic aspects, and the livelihoods of many.

Common symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, dry cough, and tiredness. A subset of patients develops a more severe form of the disease, characterized by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), as well as hematological, neurological, cardiac, and renal complications.

- **Hematological abnormalities**: Many hematological findings have been reported in COVID-19 patients. This review summarizes the reported hematological abnormalities, such as changes in platelet, white blood cell, and hemoglobin levels, and coagulation/fibrinolytic alterations. It explores their patho-mechanisms and discusses management strategies.

- **Effect on patients and drug toxicities**: The effect of COVID-19 in patients with hematological abnormalities and recognized hematological drug toxicities of therapies for COVID-19 are also outlined.

### Gohibic [^111231ZL]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

COVID-19 is caused by a virus called a coronavirus. You can get COVID-19 through contact with another person who has the virus. COVID-19 illnesses have ranged from very mild (including some with no reported symptoms) to severe, including illness resulting in death. While information so far suggests that most COVID-19 illness is mild, serious illness can happen and may cause some of your other medical conditions to become worse. People of all ages with severe, long-lasting (chronic) medical conditions like heart disease, lung disease, and diabetes, for example, seem to be at higher risk of being hospitalized for COVID-19.

- **What are the symptoms of COVID-19**: The symptoms of COVID-19 may include fever, cough, and shortness of breath, which can appear 2 to 14 days after exposure. Serious illness, including breathing problems, can occur and may cause your other medical conditions to become worse.

- **What is Gohibic**: Gohibic is an investigational medicine used for the treatment of COVID-19 in hospitalized adults when initiated within 48 hours of receiving invasive mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Gohibic is investigational because it is still being studied. Gohibic is not FDA-approved to treat COVID-19.

### Complete blood count in children with COVID-19: A predictor of disease severity [^112n3gT4]. Clinical Pediatrics (2025). Low credibility.

Blood count abnormalities are frequent in patients with severe COVID-19, but there is still a lack of information regarding pediatric complete blood count (CBC) results. This study aims to correlate CBC values in the emergency room for children aged 0 to 10 years with COVID-19 and the clinical severity of the disease. A retrospective cohort study was performed on children with COVID-19 who had CBC, C-reactive protein (CRP), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), neutrophil-to-monocyte ratio (NMR), lymphocyte-to-neutrophil ratio (LNR), lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (LMR), monocyte-to-neutrophil ratio (MNR), and monocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio (MLR) collected at the emergency room.

Demographic data from 93 children with a median age of 19 months (range 0.3–126 months), comprising 60.2% males, were included. The main changes in the CBC were atypical lymphocytes (51.6%) and eosinopenia (49.5%). Among 69 hospitalized children, 21 were considered severe cases. There was no association between age, gender, and CRP value with clinical severity. However, the presence of underlying disease was five times higher (odds ratio [OR] = 5.08) in patients who required hospitalization, and a higher NLR value was 54% more likely to occur (OR = 1.54). Eosinopenia was three times more frequent in inpatients meeting disease severity criteria (OR = 3.05).

In conclusion, children younger than 10 years old with COVID-19 experienced changes in CBC results collected in the emergency room, particularly atypical lymphocytes and eosinopenia. The presence of a comorbidity or a higher NLR increases the likelihood of hospitalization.

### Early decrease in blood lymphocyte count is associated with poor prognosis in COVID-19 patients: A retrospective cohort study [^116TG2K5]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). High credibility.

In the early stage, lymphocyte count can dynamically reflect the pathophysiological changes in COVID-19 patients. An early decrease in lymphocyte count is associated with mortality in COVID-19 patients. This finding may indicate that COVID-19 patients with decreased lymphocytes after admission need more attention.

### Serum VEGF-A levels on admission in COVID-19 patients correlate with SP-D and neutrophils, reflecting disease severity: A prospective study [^116kM7HF]. Cytokine (2024). High credibility.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in significant global morbidity and mortality. This study aimed to investigate the clinical significance of serum vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) in COVID-19 patients and its association with disease severity and pulmonary injury.

- **Methods**: We prospectively collected data from 71 hospitalized COVID-19 patients between June 2020 and January 2021. Patients were classified as either mild or severe based on their oxygen requirements during hospitalization. Serum VEGF-A levels were measured using an ELISA kit.

- **Results**: In comparison to mild cases, significantly elevated serum VEGF-A levels were observed in severe COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, VEGF-A levels exhibited a positive correlation with white blood cell count, neutrophil count, and lymphocyte count. Notably, serum surfactant protein-D (SP-D), an indicator of alveolar epithelial cell damage, was significantly higher in patients with elevated VEGF-A levels.

- **Conclusion**: These results suggest that elevated serum VEGF-A levels could serve as a prognostic biomarker for COVID-19 as it is indicative of alveolar epithelial cell injury caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Additionally, we observed a correlation between VEGF-A and neutrophil activation, which plays a role in the immune response during endothelial cell injury, indicating a potential involvement of angiogenesis in disease progression. Further research is needed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms.

### Biological mechanisms of COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome [^112LjGgp]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

What have we learned from other COVID-19 studies? Immunophenotyping of neutrophils, lymphocytes, and monocytes has demonstrated that the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, especially with a reduction in CD8+ T cells, is a marker of COVID-19 severity. Increased plasmablasts are also prognostic of organ failure. There is considerable heterogeneity in peripheral T-cell activation, ranging from robust to absent.

We also know that vascular injury and thromboses of pulmonary capillaries, small and even larger vessels, are features of severe COVID-19 ARDS, more so than in influenza-induced ARDS or classical ARDS. There is also evidence that patients with severe COVID-19 ARDS have higher pulmonary dead space, decreased lung perfusion, and elevated circulating D-dimer. There are several candidate mechanisms to account for the lung and systemic vascular injury, including neutrophil extracellular traps and hyperfibrinolysis that contribute to the elevated D-dimer.

### Increased age, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and white blood cells count are associated with higher COVID-19 mortality [^114Fb6VY]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) caused by the highly pathogenic SARS-CoV-2, was first reported from Wuhan, China, in December 2019. The present study assessed possible associations between one-month mortality and demographic data, SpO2, underlying diseases, and laboratory findings in COVID-19 patients. Since recent studies on COVID-19 have focused on the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) as an independent risk factor for in-hospital death and a significant prognostic biomarker of outcomes in critically ill patients, we assessed the predictive potential of this factor in terms of one-month mortality.

- **Methods**: Patients admitted to Imam Reza Hospital, affiliated with Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran, from March to June 2020, with positive RT-PCR results for SARS-CoV-2, were included in this study. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox proportional hazard model were used to respectively estimate one-month mortality since admission and determine factors associated with one-month mortality.

- **Results**: In this retrospective cohort study, 219 patients were included (137 men and 82 women, with a mean age of 58.2 ± 16 and 57 ± 17.3 years old, respectively). Hypertension, ischemic heart disease, and diabetes were the most common comorbidities. Among these patients, 63 were admitted to the ICU and 31 deaths occurred during the one-month follow-up. Regarding mean peripheral capillary oxygen saturation (SpO2), 142 patients had SpO2 ≤ 90%. Based on our analysis, older age and increased neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio were significant predictors of mortality.

### A persistent neutrophil-associated immune signature characterizes post-COVID-19 pulmonary sequelae [^114fspB6]. Science Translational Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Interstitial lung disease and associated fibrosis occur in a proportion of individuals who have recovered from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection through unknown mechanisms. We studied individuals with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) after recovery from acute illness. Individuals with evidence of interstitial lung changes at 3 to 6 months after recovery had an up-regulated neutrophil-associated immune signature, including increased chemokines, proteases, and markers of neutrophil extracellular traps that were detectable in the blood. Similar pathways were enriched in the upper airway with a concomitant increase in antiviral type I interferon signaling. Interaction analysis of the peripheral phosphoproteome identified enriched kinases critical for neutrophil inflammatory pathways. Evaluation of these individuals at 12 months after recovery indicated that a subset had not yet achieved full normalization of radiological and functional changes. These data provide insight into mechanisms driving the development of pulmonary sequelae during and after COVID-19 and provide a rational basis for the development of targeted approaches to prevent long-term complications.
