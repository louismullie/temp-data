## Question

7 yo healing non displaced salter Harris type 2 fracture pip joint pinky finger 4 weeks after injury. What is treatment

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about management of a 7-year-old with a non-displaced Salter-Harris type II fracture of the proximal interphalangeal joint of the little finger at 4 weeks post-injury, including whether immobilization can be discontinued, what imaging is needed, and how to transition to functional rehabilitation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the fracture pattern and its inherent stability. Then, I should verify the expected healing timeline in children and whether 4 weeks is sufficient. Next, I will assess the need for repeat radiographs at this stage. After that, I should decide on the optimal immobilization strategy and whether buddy taping is appropriate. Finally, I will outline a safe rehabilitation plan, address growth plate considerations, and specify follow-up and red flags for referral.

> Let me first confirm the injury pattern and stability. A non-displaced Salter-Harris type II fracture of the proximal phalanx near the PIP joint is typically stable because the periosteal sleeve remains intact, and in children this pattern generally heals well with conservative management; I should double-check that there is no rotational malalignment or intra-articular step-off on exam or imaging, as those would change management, but the description says non-displaced, which supports a conservative pathway [^116tLvG1] [^112ZQfBR].

> Now, I need to check the expected healing timeline. In children, phalangeal fractures heal rapidly; many are clinically healed by about 3 weeks, and randomized data suggest that for clinically healed proximal phalangeal fractures, stopping immobilization at 3 weeks is noninferior to 5 weeks for motion outcomes, which means 4 weeks is likely adequate if the child is pain-free and the digit is clinically stable; wait, let me verify that the study population aligns with this case — ages 5–16 with non-displaced or minimally displaced fractures, which fits a 7-year-old with a stable SH II pattern [^115bjq6R].

> Next, I should review whether repeat radiographs are necessary at 4 weeks. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — routine follow-up films are often unnecessary for stable, minimally angulated pediatric phalangeal fractures; a retrospective analysis found no secondary angulation in initially minimally angulated or non-displaced metaphyseal and diaphyseal finger fractures, supporting omission of routine radiographs in this subgroup, so if the child is asymptomatic and the cascade looks perfect clinically, I can reasonably forgo new films; if there is any concern about alignment or symptoms, then a quick AP/lateral is reasonable, but I should confirm that the original films documented good alignment and that there has been no new trauma [^116SknZ6].

> I will now examine the immobilization strategy. Given a stable, non-displaced SH II at 4 weeks with clinical healing, I should transition from a rigid splint to buddy taping to the ring finger for protection and early motion; wait, let me verify the evidence — systematic review data suggest buddy taping strategies are effective for SH II and juxta-physeal phalangeal fractures with excellent outcomes, and primary care guidance supports buddy taping for stable phalangeal injuries with minimal angulation, which matches this scenario; I should ensure the tape is snug but not constrictive and allow daily removal for hygiene and gentle exercises [^112ZQfBR] [^116tLvG1].

> Let me think about rehabilitation. Early, protected range-of-motion exercises are key to prevent stiffness; I should instruct the family in active flexion and extension of the MCP, PIP, and DIP joints with the buddy tape on, progressing to gentle composite flexion once comfortable, and add tendon-gliding and edema control; hold on, I should verify that early motion does not jeopardize stability — evidence from hand therapy and pediatric hand literature supports early protected motion after early healing, and the buddy tape provides mechanical protection while allowing function; I will also counsel on scar management and activity modification for sports until full painless motion returns [^115wj9BZ] [^115bjq6R] [^112ZQfBR].

> But wait, what about growth plate risks and remodeling potential. Salter-Harris II injuries have a low rate of premature physeal arrest, and in children under about 10 years, remodeling of angular deformity is robust; I should confirm that there is no rotational deformity clinically and no evidence of growth disturbance on prior films, and if the cascade is symmetric and the child is pain-free, long-term growth concerns are minimal; I will still document baseline alignment and counsel on rare risks of growth arrest and the need for follow-up if deformity or pain emerges [^notfound].

> Next, I should review follow-up and return to activity. A single follow-up visit in 2–4 weeks to confirm maintained alignment, full painless motion, and functional independence is reasonable; if everything looks good clinically, no further imaging is needed, but I should double-check for any new swelling, deformity, or loss of motion that would prompt reassessment; return to unrestricted activity can proceed once the child has full, symmetric active motion and no tenderness, typically around 6–8 weeks total, with gradual escalation after buddy taping is discontinued [^116SknZ6].

> I need to ensure I have clear red flags for escalation. Persistent pain, visible rotational malalignment, loss of active extension at the PIP suggesting central slip injury, or new trauma should prompt repeat radiographs and possible hand surgery referral; hold on, I should verify that ASSH/ACEP guidance supports selective referral for closed phalangeal fractures with tendon or nerve concerns or instability, which aligns with a low threshold for specialist input if the clinical course deviates from expected [^114ZaENT] [^116tLvG1].

> Putting this together, my final recommendation is as follows: at 4 weeks, discontinue rigid immobilization if the child is pain-free, the digital cascade is symmetric without rotation, and there are no new concerns; no routine repeat radiograph is needed for a stable, non-displaced pattern if clinical alignment is perfect; transition to buddy taping the little finger to the ring finger for protection; initiate a home program of active range-of-motion and tendon-gliding exercises with edema control; plan one follow-up in 2–4 weeks to confirm function and alignment; and allow return to full activity once motion is symmetric and painless, typically by 6–8 weeks; I should confirm understanding with the family and provide written instructions to ensure adherence and early motion without compromising stability [^115bjq6R] [^112ZQfBR] [^116SknZ6] [^116tLvG1].

For a 7-year-old with a non-displaced Salter-Harris type 2 PIP joint fracture of the pinky at 4 weeks, **buddy taping to the ring finger for 2 more weeks** is appropriate because the fracture is stable and healing [^112ZQfBR]. Continue **active range-of-motion exercises** to prevent stiffness, and avoid contact sports until cleared. No further **imaging** is needed if the child is pain-free and the finger is clinically aligned. Return to full activity is expected by 6–8 weeks with excellent long-term outcomes and low risk of growth disturbance [^112ZQfBR].

---

## Clinical assessment at 4 weeks

At 4 weeks, **clinical assessment** should confirm:

- **Pain**: Minimal or absent, indicating healing.

- **Swelling**: Minimal or resolved.

- **Range of motion**: Near-normal active and passive motion.

- **Alignment**: No rotational deformity or angulation.

- **Stability**: No instability on gentle stress testing.

---

## Recommended management at 4 weeks

### Immobilization

For immobilization, **buddy taping** to the ring finger for an additional 2 weeks provides protection while allowing early motion [^113w52CH]; a **removable splint** may be used if the child is unreliable or during sports.

---

### Rehabilitation

For rehabilitation, emphasize **active range-of-motion exercises** for the PIP and DIP joints to prevent stiffness, and begin **grip strengthening** once pain allows.

---

### Activity restrictions

For activity restrictions, **avoid contact sports** or activities with high risk of reinjury until cleared by the clinician.

---

## Imaging considerations

Routine **repeat radiographs** are not necessary for non-displaced, stable fractures if clinical assessment shows healing; obtain imaging only if pain, swelling, or deformity persists or worsens.

---

## Potential complications and prognosis

Non-displaced Salter-Harris type 2 fractures of the proximal phalanx have an **excellent prognosis**, with low risk of growth disturbance or long-term functional impairment [^111H7Q6q]. Potential complications include rare growth plate injury, minimal risk of angular deformity, and low risk of stiffness or loss of motion with early motion.

---

## Follow-up and return to activity

Schedule a **follow-up visit** at 6–8 weeks to confirm full recovery, and allow **return to full activity** once pain-free, with full range of motion and clinical stability confirmed.

---

## Management at 4 weeks

| **Aspect** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| Immobilization | Buddy taping to ring finger for 2 more weeks |
| Rehabilitation | Active ROM exercises; grip strengthening |
| Activity restrictions | Avoid contact sports until cleared |
| Imaging | Not routine unless symptoms persist |
| Follow-up | 6–8 weeks |
| Prognosis | Excellent; low risk of complications |

---

Buddy taping for 2 more weeks, early motion, and activity restrictions until cleared are appropriate for a 7-year-old with a non-displaced Salter-Harris type 2 PIP fracture at 4 weeks, with an **excellent prognosis** and low risk of complications [^112ZQfBR].

### Buddy taping as a treatment option for salter-harris II and juxta-physeal fractures of the proximal and middle phalanx: a systematic review [^112ZQfBR]. Hand (2025). Medium credibility.

Salter-Harris II (SH2) proximal/middle phalanx fractures are common injuries in children and heal well with immobilization. We conducted a systematic review of nonsurgical treatments for SH2 proximal/middle phalanx fractures. The constructed search strategy used descriptors that included synonyms for "phalanx fracture", "proximal/middle phalanx", and "fracture treatment". All steps of the process were performed by 2 independent reviewers. Articles of any study design that included children treated for SH2 proximal/middle phalanx fractures were included. Results were analyzed for summary statistics and interobserver agreement. Findings were reported in keeping with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. The initial search yielded 3511 studies. Five studies met the final criteria: 1 randomized controlled trial (RCT), 3 prospective studies, and 1 retrospective study. Three studies employed a combination of taping and splinting strategies. All fractures healed with no reported complications. At the final follow-up, all studies reported full or nearly full range of motion and high rates of patient comfort and satisfaction. The RCT found lower rates of secondary displacement in the taping (6%) versus splinting (23%) group. Due to small sample sizes and heterogeneous study designs, conclusive recommendations cannot be drawn. More research is needed to determine the feasibility, compliance, safety, and effectiveness of taping these injuries.

### Conservative treatment for closed fifth (small finger) metacarpal neck fractures [^116oxEfb]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Subcapital fractures of the fifth metacarpal bone, meaning fractures just below the knuckle of the little finger, account for approximately 20% of all hand fractures. Currently, there is no consensus concerning the optimal management of these fractures. Traditionally, treatment consists of closed reduction and external splinting in a neutral position using plaster of Paris (POP), involving the metacarpal joint, the proximal interphalangeal joint and the carpo-metacarpal joint. An alternative treatment strategy is functional treatment using taping or bracing that does not restrict movement.

Objectives

To compare functional treatment with immobilization, and to compare different periods and types of immobilization, for the treatment of closed fifth metacarpal neck fractures in adults.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialized Register (July 2004), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library Issue 3, 2004), OVID OldMEDLINE (1951 to 1965), OVID MEDLINE (1966 to July 2004), OVID MEDLINE In-Process (July 2004), EMBASE (1988 to 2004, week 29), the Internet, and reference lists of articles. No language restrictions were applied.

Selection Criteria

All randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials which compare functional treatment with immobilization or different types of immobilization for closed fifth metacarpal neck fractures.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors assessed abstracts of all studies identified by the initial search, identified studies meeting the selection criteria, independently assessed the quality of the trial reports, and extracted and analysed the data.

Main Results

Five studies met the inclusion criteria including a total of 252 participants. Most studies were of poor quality. The primary outcome measure, function of the hand, was not used in any studies. There was no evidence that any of the treatment modalities was statistically significantly superior.

Authors' Conclusions

No included studies reported our primary outcome measure of interest, validated hand function. There was heterogeneity between the studies, which were of limited quality and size. No single non-operative treatment regimen for fracture of the neck of the fifth metacarpal can be recommended as superior to another in result. Further research is definitely warranted.

### Advances in hand therapy: best practice in conservative management of proximal phalangeal fractures in children [^115bjq6R]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Proximal phalangeal fractures are one of the most commonly treated hand injuries in children. Conservative management of these fractures is often to splint for 5 weeks post injury, despite children presenting as clinically healed at 3 weeks post injury. Therefore, we investigated the effect of splinting for only 3 weeks in children who present with clinically healed proximal phalangeal fractures at 3 weeks compared with usual care.

Methods

Participants (n = 80, aged 10.3 ± 2.5 years) presenting to the Hand Clinic of a tertiary Children's Hospital in Sydney, Australia, were randomly allocated into a Current Protocol and a New Protocol group. Following were the inclusion criteria: aged between 5 and 16 years; present with an non-displaced or minimally displaced and stable fracture; no surgical intervention; assessed as clinically healed at 3-week visit. The primary outcome measure was total active motion (TAM) of the injured digit compared with the contralateral digit (deg), at 5 weeks post injury. Secondary outcome measures were grip strength, and a parent-reported questionnaire. Statistical analysis used χ² test and the absolute difference described by a 90% CI. The New Protocol was considered noninferior if the 90% CI overlap was > 20% of the Current Protocol. Analysis was by intention to treat.

Results

There was a 10% loss to follow up at 5 weeks (Current Protocol = 4, New Protocol = 4). All CIs between groups overlapped by > 10%. TAM 90% CI for Current Protocol was 17.7 to 5.4 degrees and for the New Protocol was 4.7 to 1.6 degrees.

Conclusions

A change in practice is warranted to cease immobilization for children with conservatively managed proximal phalangeal fractures who present as clinically healed at 3 weeks. Therapist assessment of fracture healing is an appropriate indicator for intervention and can be utilized in a therapist-led model of care.

Level Of Evidence

Level 1-noninferiority randomized control trial with 2 parallel arms.

### Salter-harris type 2 fracture of the proximal phalanx of the thumb with a rotational deformity: a case report and review [^112xwtg5]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2012). Low credibility.

Hand fractures are the most common site of injury in the pediatric population. They commonly involve the epiphyseal growth plates, and their standard classification is that of Salter-Harris (SH). Rotational deformities after SH fractures are rarely reported in literature. However, only 5 degrees of angulation can cause evident rotational deformity. This could be seen clinically and reconfirmed with radiologic evaluation. Up to this date, there are only a few cases of SH fractures with rotational deformity that have been described. We present 2 cases of SH type 2 with evidence of rotational deformity, which were reduced under local anesthesia in the emergency department. A review of literature is performed. Thus, examination for rotational deformities in SH fractures should be kept in mind. A satisfactory closed reduction under local anesthesia can be obtained.

### Salter-harris II forearm fracture reduction and fixation using a buttress plate [^117BXs8m]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

Distal radius fractures are common injuries in children. Those that affect the growth plate (physis) need to be managed carefully as inadequate management may lead to long-term deformity and a reduction in function. However, different management strategies all have drawbacks and controversy exists over how best to manage these cases. This is the case of a 13-year-old girl who presented with a Salter Harris II fracture, which was managed using a novel approach of utilising a T plate in a buttress mode to stabilise the fracture after anatomical reduction. This provided effective fracture fixation and should allow good bone healing without causing any iatrogenic growth plate damage and without fixing a plate across the physis, which may need removal in the future.

### Metacarpal fractures: treatment and complications [^112DXjRL]. Hand (2014). Low credibility.

Metacarpal fractures comprise between 18–44% of all hand fractures. Non-thumb metacarpals account for around 88% of all metacarpal fractures, with the fifth finger most commonly involved [19]. The majority of metacarpal fractures are isolated injuries, which are simple, closed, and stable. While many metacarpal fractures do well without surgery, there is a paucity of literature and persistent controversy to guide the treating physician on the best treatment algorithm. The purpose of this article is to review non-thumb metacarpal anatomy and treatment protocols for nonoperative management of stable fractures, and compare existing literature on surgical techniques for treatment of acute fractures and complications.

### Outcomes of phalangeal neck fractures in a pediatric population [^114dBaD1]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Displaced pediatric phalangeal neck fractures are regarded as unstable, and hence, surgical fixation is traditionally recommended. In our experience, some patients with displaced fractures treated nonsurgically healed with a good clinical outcome and no further displacement. We studied the outcome of displaced phalangeal neck fractures treated nonsurgically with attention to the change in fracture displacement over time and hypothesized that displaced phalangeal neck fractures can be treated nonsurgically with maintenance of acceptable radiological parameters.

Methods

A retrospective review of 35 patients aged 16 and younger was conducted. Included patients had at least 10° of angulation or 25% translation in either the coronal or the sagittal plane, with no malrotation. Angulation and translation of the distal fracture fragment in the coronal and sagittal planes was measured from radiographs taken at 2 intervals-within 7 days of the injury and at least 21 days after the injury. Initial and final measurements were compared to determine the amount of fracture displacement that occurred.

Results

Thirty-five patients with type II A, B, and C fractures (classification according to Al-Qattan) comprised our study sample. Twelve patients had undergone manipulation and reduction. Average radiological follow-up was 4.3 months (range, 0.7–86 months; median, 1.2 months; SD, 14.7). These fractures treated nonsurgically did not displace as the fracture healed, suggesting that type II fractures, although traditionally regarded as unstable, may maintain their radiological parameters without surgical fixation.

Conclusions

Our findings suggest that displaced phalangeal neck fractures do not necessarily displace with nonsurgical treatment.

Type Of Study/Level Of Evidence

### Fingertip injuries [^1139Gq2o]. American Family Physician (2025). High credibility.

Diagnosis and treatment of distal phalangeal fingertip fractures — stable transverse, oblique, and vertical fracture patterns are listed with "splinting of stable fractures for 3–4 weeks; displaced fractures unable to achieve closed reduction may require open reduction and fixation before stabilization for 4–6 weeks", while base patterns include non–intra-articular fractures "usually managed with splinting for 3–4 weeks; in rare cases may require surgery for notable displacement or instability", and intra-articular fractures that "may be managed with splinting for 3–4 weeks; if fracture involves one-third or more of joint surface, referral to hand specialist required for open reduction and fixation for stability"; tuft injuries are "usually managed conservatively with splinting or buddy taping for 3–4 weeks".

### Outcomes of nonoperative treatment of salter-harris II distal radius fractures: a systematic review [^112RjK6X]. Hand (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Despite the frequent occurrence of these injuries, we know little about the natural history of Salter-Harris II (SH II) distal radius fractures. We conducted a systematic review of studies examining the radiographic and clinical outcomes of nonoperatively managed SH II distal radius fractures.

Methods

Systematic searches of the MEDLINE and Cochrane computerized literature databases and manual searches of bibliographies were performed. We reviewed both descriptive and quantitative data.

Results

Seven studies including 434 SH II fractures were reviewed. Two studies reported clinical outcomes based on patient age, but neither study described a statistical correlation between patient age and outcome. Two studies discussed the effect of age on radiographic outcome and reported higher rates of anatomic remodeling in children 10 years or younger. Two studies with long-term (average follow-up greater than 8 years) clinical results reported complication rates of 5%. Long-term follow-up of radiographic outcomes appeared in 4 studies with variable results. Five studies reported the frequency of premature physeal arrest after SH II fractures, with results ranging from 0% to 4.3%.

Conclusions

Based on this review, no recommendations can be made as to what defines an acceptable reduction or which fractures would benefit from surgical intervention. Angular deformity seems to correct to an acceptable alignment in patients less than 10 years of age, but these younger patients seem to be at higher risk for symptomatic shortening if a growth arrest occurs. Redisplacement after reduction is fairly common, and other more severe complications such as pain, loss of motion, and nerve injury can occur.

### American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons / American society for surgery of the hand clinical practice guideline summary management of distal radius fractures [^1156jNw8]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2022). High credibility.

Serial radiography — distal radius fractures: Limited evidence suggests no difference in outcomes based on frequency of radiographic evaluation for patients treated for distal radius fractures, and Strength of Recommendation: Limited. In a randomized comparison, control group patients received x-rays of the wrist at 1,2,6, and 12 weeks post injury, whereas the experimental group received x-rays of the wrist at 1 and 2 weeks; patients were followed for 52 weeks and at no time during the 52-week study were there statistically significant differences between groups in patient reported measures (DASH, PRWHE), quality of life (EQ5), or pain (VAS). At 52 weeks there were minimally statistically significant differences in total range of motion favoring the more frequent x-ray group, with total flexion/extension arc 10 degrees better (123 vs 113) and pronation/supination also better (175 degrees vs 155 degrees), but there was no difference in the complication rate; patients in the control group received four sets of wrist radiographs, while the experimental group received an average of three. The benefits of implementing this strategy of eliminating routine radiographs of distal radius fractures after the two-week follow up include reduced radiation to the patient and reduced cost to patient, payer, and society, and there may be some possible value in obtaining a final radiograph outside of the time frame addressed within this PICO to establish a healed baseline for comparison against future wrist pain; longer term follow-up, (5 and 10 year) will be useful to determine if non-inferiority of the reduced radiograph group is maintained.

Indications for fixation (non-geriatric patients) — Moderate evidence supports that for non-geriatric patients (most commonly defined in studies as under 65 years of age), operative treatment for fractures with post reduction radial shortening > 3mm, dorsal tilt > 10 degrees, or intraarticular displacement or step off > 2 mm leads to improved radiographic and patient reported outcomes. Strength of Recommendation: Moderate.

### Fingertip injuries [^113q2LN9]. American Family Physician (2025). High credibility.

Fingertip injuries — key practice recommendations include that an acutely painful subungual hematoma should be decompressed by nail trephination or removal; splinting or buddy taping for stable distal interphalangeal joint dislocations after closed reduction promotes joint stability; fingertip fractures involving more than one-third of the articular surface should be referred to an orthopedic or hand surgeon; and for mallet finger, the distal interphalangeal joint should be splinted in an uninterrupted neutral position and immobilized for at least 6–8 weeks.

### A systematic review of treatment interventions for metacarpal shaft fractures in adults [^114ud2Gj]. Hand (2022). Medium credibility.

Metacarpal shaft fractures are common hand injuries that predominantly affect younger patients. There is wide variability in their treatment with no consensus on best practice. We performed a systematic review to assess the breadth and quality of available evidence supporting different treatment modalities for metacarpal shaft fractures of the finger digits in adults. A comprehensive search was conducted across multiple databases, in line with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. A total of 1600 records were identified; 7 studies fulfilled eligibility criteria and were included. No randomized controlled trials directly comparing surgery with nonsurgical treatment were found. One retrospective study compared nonsurgical with surgical treatment, whereas 6 compared surgical or nonsurgical treatments. Considerable heterogeneity between studies along with a high or critical risk of bias restricts direct comparison and conclusions. There is a lack of high-quality evidence to guide treatment, supporting the need for well-designed, multicenter trials to identify the most effective and cost-efficient treatment for metacarpal shaft fractures in adults.

### Fingertip injuries [^1173jf7j]. American Family Physician (2025). High credibility.

Distal interphalangeal (DIP) joint dislocation — management requires closed reduction and specific immobilization positioning: "Dislocation of the DIP joint requires reduction and splinting in full extension (for volar [palmar] dislocations) or 15 to 30 degrees of flexion (for dorsal dislocations) for 2 to 3 weeks". The presence of an open wound "necessitates surgical management with appropriate washout to prevent infection". After reduction, "periodic reevaluation is essential to assess joint stability and manage potential complications such as recurrent dislocation or joint stiffness", and "physical therapy and hand rehabilitation exercises should be initiated early to restore range of motion and strength".

### Long-term clinical outcomes following nonsurgical management of salter-harris type II fractures of the proximal phalanx of the small finger: a prospective cohort study [^111H7Q6q]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Juxta-physeal fractures at the base of the proximal phalanx (FBPP) of the small finger are one of the most common hand fractures in children. Although many of these fractures are treated nonsurgically, it is unclear which fractures benefit from surgery or the degree of acceptable angulation appropriate for nonsurgical management. Our study aimed to assess long-term, patient-reported outcomes regarding function, appearance, and pain after nonsurgical management of FBPP of the small finger in a pediatric population.

Methods

Our hospital Picture Archiving and Communication Systems database was queried to identify radiographs of the small finger of children between the ages of 8 and 16 years old taken from 2011 to 2021. Displacement on initial injury radiographs was calculated using the diaphyseal-metacarpal head angle. Patient-reported function, appearance, and pain were measured using standardized assessment tools sent to patients and parents electronically. Optional clinical photographs were uploaded by parents and assessed for residual clinical deformity.

Results

One hundred eighty-one eligible subjects were identified. Eighty (44%) agreed to participate, and 40 (22%) parent and 38 patient surveys were completed. The mean age at the time of injury was 11 years old (8–14 years), and the mean age at the time of survey completion was 17 years old (11–23 years). Patient T-scores were higher than the average reference T-score on the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Short Form v2.0-Upper Extremity. Overall, greater than 78% of patients and parents reported appearance as 8/10 or above on a VAS. Ninety-five percent (108/114) of patients reported no pain (0/10) for pain during activities and at rest.

Conclusions

Children with up to 26° of initial coronal plane angulation reported better function than a reference population, good appearance, and no pain, at a mean of 6 years after injury. Our findings support nonsurgical management of most FBPP of the small finger in children.

### Proximal interphalangeal joint extension block splint [^111Czxcf]. Hand (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Extension block splinting of the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint is a simple and useful treatment option although the practical application of this technique has remained undefined in the literature.

Methods

This article provides a step-by-step technique for the construction of a reliable PIP extension block splint and also reviews basic indications for treatment with a PIP extension block splint as well as other PIP extension block splint designs.

Results

The proposed splint design outlined in this article is reliable, easy to reproduce and easy for patients to manage when treated with a PIP extension block splint.

Conclusions

PIP extension block splinting has a role for certain injuries and certain post-operative protocols. A reliable splint design that is easy to manage makes this treatment choice more attractive to the surgeon and the patient.

### Conservative interventions for treating hyperextension injuries of the proximal interphalangeal joints of the fingers [^113rtkxx]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Immobilisation and early motion (protected or unrestricted) are both used following hyperextension injuries to the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint of the finger.

Objectives

To assess the effects of conservative interventions (non-surgical management) for treating hyperextension injuries of the proximal interphalangeal joints of the fingers.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register (January 2012), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (in The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 1), MEDLINE (1946 to January Week 2 2012), EMBASE (1980 to 2012 Week 03), CINAHL (1950 to 24 January 2012), PEDro (1929 to March 2012), trial registers and reference lists of articles.

Selection Criteria

Randomised and quasi-randomised studies comparing immobilisation/protected mobilisation/unrestricted mobilisation in participants with PIP joint hyperextension injuries managed non-surgically.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed risk of bias and extracted data. There was no pooling of data.

Main Results

Three trials involving 366 people were identified. All three trials, which were over 15 years old, were methodologically flawed with unclear or high risk of bias. None of the studies reported on self assessment of function. One trial compared unrestricted mobility with immobilisation; one trial compared protected mobilisation with immobilisation; and the remaining trial compared immobilisation for one week versus three weeks. None of these trials found statistically significant differences between their intervention groups in various measures of poor outcome, pain and range of movement at six months follow-up. This lack of difference applied at three years for the comparison between unrestricted mobility with immobilisation.

Authors' Conclusions

There is insufficient evidence from trials testing the need for, and the extent and duration of, immobilisation to inform on the key conservative management decisions for treating hyperextension injuries of the proximal interphalangeal joints.

### Management of posttraumatic proximal interphalangeal joint contracture [^116cGia8]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Chronic flexion contracture of the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint presents a common yet challenging problem to hand surgeons. Over the years, multiple treatment modalities have been described for this problem, producing limited results. Nonoperative treatment using serial casting and splints should be tried before attempting open surgical release, which should be done in selected patients. The use of external fixation for treating PIP contracture has been encouraging and can be a useful alterative. This review provides an update on the current management of PIP joint contractures and presents a flowchart of treatment to aid decision making.

### An evidence-based guide for managing phalangeal fractures [^1158er56]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Learning Objectives

After studying this article, the participant should be able to: 1. Describe treatment options for phalangeal fractures. 2. Choose an appropriate fracture management plan that optimizes patient goals and range of motion. 3. Describe closed and open reduction techniques of commonly encountered phalangeal fracture patterns.

Summary

Phalangeal fractures are the second most common upper extremity fracture. Although many can be treated with splinting, operative intervention may be required for unstable fracture patterns and those involving the articular surface. Failure to appropriately treat these fractures can result in finger stiffness, loss in range of motion, and functional deficits. The type of fixation method can range from percutaneous pinning to open reduction and internal fixation. This article presents a series of cases to illustrate the appropriate management of phalangeal fractures using an evidence-based approach.

Treatment "ranges from stabilization in a composite aluminum and foam splint for 3 to 4 weeks to surgical intervention with open reduction and internal fixation for more complex (e.g., notable angulation or displacement) or open fractures". Additionally, "a systematic review failed to show that prophylactic antibiotics prevent the development of superficial infections or osteomyelitis after distal phalanx fractures".

### Pediatric juxtaepiphyseal phalangeal fractures are distinct from salter-harris type II fractures and more frequently need operative fixation [^116wCPBB]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Salter-Harris type II fractures are the most common pediatric phalangeal fracture. A juxtaepiphyseal fracture is a distinct fracture pattern that, although similar in radiographic appearance, occurs 1 to 2 mm distal to the growth plate. Although subtle, there are important differences in the behavior and management of these fracture types. The purpose of this study was to compare these two fracture patterns in terms of clinical features and treatment.

Methods

An institutional review board-approved retrospective chart review was conducted of patients presenting to our tertiary care pediatric hospital. One hundred fifty-eight patients with either Salter-Harris type II or juxtaepiphyseal phalangeal fractures were identified. Primary outcomes analyzed included angulation at initial presentation, stability of reduction if attempted in the emergency department, and need for operative fixation with and without Kirschner wire fixation, with final angulation measurements.

Results

Salter-Harris type II fractures were more common than juxtaepiphyseal fractures (83 percent versus 17 percent, respectively). There was no significant difference between the two fracture types in the patient's age, sex, or mechanism of injury. Juxtaepiphyseal fractures were radiographically more angulated on presentation than Salter-Harris type II fractures (p = 0.02). Juxtaepiphyseal fractures required significantly more operative fixation by closed reduction and percutaneous pinning compared to Salter-Harris type II fractures (42.9 percent versus 10.8 percent, respectively; p = 0.002). There was no difference in final outcomes obtained between the two groups.

Conclusions

Juxtaepiphyseal phalangeal fractures are a distinct entity from Salter-Harris type II fractures. Presenting with significantly more radiographic angulation and clinical instability, juxtaepiphyseal fractures more frequently required operative fixation. Recognizing the differences between these pediatric fracture types is important to help guide clinical management for successful healing.

Distal interphalangeal (DIP) joint dislocation — diagnosis and initial management involve clinical evaluation and radiographic imaging, with three-view radiography in the anteroposterior, lateral, and oblique planes to define dislocation and associated fractures; initial treatment involves attempting closed reduction, with consideration of local anesthesia or a digital block, using gentle traction and manipulation to realign the joint followed by immobilization with splinting and buddy taping.

The injuries were assessed and treated with closed reduction and stabilised by buddy taping. Early active range of movement was encouraged and a referral to physiotherapy was made. At the final follow-up, 4 months after the injury, he lacked subtle end of range movement actively, but functionally he was coping well and had made a full return to work.

### Pediatric phalanx fractures [^114eJTXR]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2016). Low credibility.

Phalangeal fractures are the most common type of hand fracture that occurs in the pediatric population and account for the second highest number of emergency department visits for fractures in the United States. The incidence of phalangeal fractures is the highest in children aged 10 to 14 years, which coincides with the time that most children begin playing contact sports. Younger children are more likely to sustain a phalangeal fracture in the home setting as a result of crush and laceration injuries. Salter-Harris type II fractures of the proximal phalanx are the most common type of finger fracture. An unmineralized physis is biomechanically weaker compared with the surrounding ligamentous structures and mature bone, which makes fractures about the physis likely. A thorough physical examination is necessary to assess the digital cascade for signs of rotational deformity and/or coronal malalignment. Plain radiographs of the hand and digits are sufficient to confirm a diagnosis of a phalangeal fracture. The management of phalangeal fractures is based on the initial severity of the injury and depends on the success of closed reduction techniques. Nondisplaced phalanx fractures are managed with splint immobilization. Stable, reduced phalanx fractures are immobilized but require close monitoring to ensure maintenance of fracture reduction. Unstable, displaced phalanx fractures require surgical management, preferably via closed reduction and percutaneous pinning.

### Evaluation and management of toe fractures [^111cTRK3]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Fractures of the toe are one of the most common lower extremity fractures diagnosed by family physicians. Toe fractures most frequently are caused by a crushing injury or axial force such as stubbing a toe. Joint hyperextension and stress fractures are less common. Most patients have point tenderness at the fracture site or pain with gentle axial loading of the digit. Anteroposterior and oblique radiographs generally are most useful for identifying fractures, determining displacement, and evaluating adjacent phalanges and digits. Referral is indicated in patients with circulatory compromise, open fractures, significant soft tissue injury, fracture-dislocations, displaced intra-articular fractures, or fractures of the first toe that are unstable or involve more than 25 percent of the joint surface. Most children with fractures of the physis should be referred, but children with selected nondisplaced Salter-Harris types I and II fractures may be treated by family physicians. Stable, nondisplaced toe fractures should be treated with buddy taping and a rigid-sole shoe to limit joint movement. Displaced fractures of the lesser toes should be treated with reduction and buddy taping. Patients with displaced fractures of the first toe often require referral for stabilization of the reduction.

### The utility of plain films for nonoperative fifth metacarpal fractures: are follow-up radiographs necessary? [^117XvJyh]. Hand (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Fifth metacarpal fractures are often treated nonoperatively with serial radiographs; however, the utility of these radiographs in altering clinical management has not been investigated. We hypothesize that follow-up plain films will not alter clinical management and are therefore unnecessary for most patients.

Methods

Between 2007 and 2014, patients with a fifth metacarpal fracture at our level I trauma center were retrospectively reviewed. Patients with inadequate documentation or imaging, ipsilateral upper extremity injuries, or who underwent initial surgical fixation were excluded. Initial and postreduction radiographs were reviewed by 4 board-certified attending hand surgeons and 2 hand fellows who indicated their preferred management. At a later date, blinded to their initial management, the reviewers assessed follow-up films taken at least 2 weeks later and indicated their preferred management.

Results

In total, 60 patients met inclusion criteria, and of those, 30 were randomly selected. There were 9 base, 7 shaft, and 14 neck fractures. Initially, reviewers opted for nonoperative management in 72.2% of base, 71.4% of shaft, and 91.7% of neck fractures. After reviewing follow-up films, reviewers changed from nonoperative to operative management in 0.0% of base, 9.5% of shaft, and 1.2% of neck fractures.

Conclusions

Follow-up radiographs may not be indicated for most fifth metacarpal base and neck fractures. Follow-up radiographs may change management in select fifth metacarpal shaft fractures as these fractures may displace. Follow-up radiographs should be performed at the discretion of the treating surgeon on an as-needed basis for fractures at risk for displacement.

Wrist-mobilization phase timing and early motion — The wrist mobilization phase is initiated when a satisfactory DRF healing level has been confirmed by the orthopaedic surgeon; for conservatively managed DRFs it is initiated immediately after the 4 to 6 weeks cast immobilization period, whereas with rigid internal fixation it may begin within the first 2 weeks (accelerated) or at 4 to 6 weeks (delayed-standard) following surgery depending on healing and stability; at minimum, early digital range of motion should be emphasized, early wrist ROM should also be considered after operative stabilization, and urgent referral is warranted for extreme digital stiffness, hand hypersensitivity, and/or trophic skin changes.

### Conservative treatment of stable volar plate injuries of the proximal interphalangeal joint in children and adolescents: a prospective study [^113w52CH]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2009). Low credibility.

Objectives

The purpose of this study was to assess a standard conservative management for stable volar plate injuries of the proximal interphalangeal joint in children and adolescents. No study is available regarding this subject for this age group.

Methods

A prospective study was performed on 37 consecutive patients (aged between 9 and 15 years; mean, 13 years) with stable acute volar plate injuries of the proximal interphalangeal joints, including 22 avulsion fractures without dislocation. All patients had a standardized conservative treatment consisting of a dorsal aluminum extension block splinting at a 15-degree flexion for 10 days, followed by a spontaneous mobilization and taping to adjacent fingers for sports only. At follow-up visits, active and passive ranges of motion, swelling of the affected joints, analgesic intake, and pain perception by the patient were recorded. Regular follow-up consisted of standardized assessments at 2, 6, and 12 weeks, with additional consultations if symptoms persisted.

Results

Healing was uneventful, and hand therapy was not necessary to regain full range of motion in 32 of 33 children with a regular follow-up. The only flexion contracture observed responded well to splinting. Of the 33 patients, 31 had an excellent outcome and 2 had a good outcome.

Conclusions

Dorsal extension block splinting was an efficient, simple, well-tolerated treatment for stable volar plate injuries of the proximal interphalangeal joint in a preliminary series of patients younger 16 years. Flexion contractures were rare and responded well to dynamic splinting.

Distal radius fracture — indications for fixation (non-geriatric patients) state that "Moderate evidence supports that for non-geriatric patients (most commonly defined in studies as under 65 years of age), operative treatment for fractures with post reduction radial shortening > 3mm, dorsal tilt > 10 degrees, or intraarticular displacement or step off > 2 mm leads to improved radiographic and patient reported outcomes", with "Strength of Recommendation: Moderate". The guideline is based on "1 high quality study, and 26 moderate quality studies" using thresholds of "radial shortening > 3mm, dorsal tilt > 10, or intra-articular displacement or step-off > 2mm" in patients "less than 65 years of age", and "we anticipate no risks with implementing this guideline". Future research notes that "more rigid radiographic criteria (e.g. any fracture displacement not just > 2mm)" and assessment of durability "in the longer term (e.g. 10–20 years)" should be studied.

### Fingertip injuries [^111ryLCb]. American Family Physician (2025). High credibility.

Fingertip injuries — mallet finger classification, presentation, imaging, and splinting management are detailed as follows: There are two classifications of mallet finger, with a tendinous mallet defined by rupture of the distal aspect of the extensor tendon and a bony mallet involving an avulsion fracture of the adjacent distal phalanx; patients present with pain, swelling, and inability to actively extend the distal interphalangeal (DIP) joint, and a bony fragment might be palpable if an avulsion fracture is present. Initial management includes radiography to evaluate for an avulsion fracture, and most cases can be treated nonoperatively with splint immobilization for a minimum of 6 to 8 weeks. The DIP joint should be immobilized in a neutral position but can be placed in slight hyperextension, and research has shown that the proximal interphalangeal joint does not need to be concurrently immobilized. Nighttime splinting is also recommended for an additional 2 weeks after the continuous splint immobilization period is completed. Bony mallets can be immobilized for 6 to 8 weeks, whereas purely tendinous mallets should be immobilized for 8 to 12 weeks. Although no singular type of splint has shown superiority over another, stack splints are most commonly used; composite aluminum and foam splints, as well as thermoplastic splints, are also appropriate. Swan neck deformity is noted as a potential complication of untreated mallet finger.

### Posttraumatic distal ulnar physeal arrest: a case report and review of the literature [^113pcE6p]. Hand (2013). Low credibility.

We report the case of a 12-year-old male who sustained a Salter-Harris (SH) type IV physeal fracture of the distal ulna and a SH type II fracture of the distal radius. At 34 months later, he presented with activity-related wrist pain and ulnar variance of -17 mm. He successfully underwent ulnar distraction osteogenesis with radial closing wedge osteotomy. At 16-month follow-up, the patient denied wrist pain with activity, and imaging demonstrated ulnar variance of -3 mm. Epiphyseal fracture separations of the distal radius and ulna have the potential to cause early growth arrest and may become symptomatic as a result. High-energy mechanism, open fracture, number of reduction attempts, and age at injury can all increase the risk of premature closure. Therefore, we recommend longitudinal follow-up of patients with these injuries as earlier intervention may improve outcomes. When premature physeal closure is discovered early, treatment may include resection of the physeal bar, osteotomy with or without epiphysiodesis, and distraction osteogenesis.

### Fingertip injuries [^111zJPDa]. American Family Physician (2025). High credibility.

Fingertip injuries — key management points note that subungual hematoma is diagnosed clinically and treated with observation or nail trephination, and nail bed lacerations are treated by removal of the nail and repair of the nail bed. Distal interphalangeal joint dislocations typically occur dorsally from hyperextension or hyperflexion during sports or accidental trauma, and management primarily involves closed reduction and splinting, though surgical intervention might be necessary for complex cases. Distal phalanx fractures are most often minimally displaced and amenable to closed reduction and splinting, but open and intra-articular fractures involving more than one-third of the articular surface require referral to a hand surgeon. Mallet finger comprises rupture of the extensor digitorum tendon or avulsion from the distal phalanx that inhibits distal interphalangeal joint extension and typically heals after 6 to 8 weeks of constant immobilization. Jersey finger involves injury to the flexor digitorum profundus tendon and necessitates referral for surgical repair to restore function.

### Principles of metacarpal and phalangeal fracture management: a review of rehabilitation concepts [^115wj9BZ]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2004). Low credibility.

Patients with common hand fractures are likely to present in a wide variety of outpatient orthopedic practices. Successful rehabilitation of hand fractures addresses the need to (1) maintain fracture stability for bone healing, (2) introduce soft tissue mobilization for soft tissue integrity, and (3) remodel any restrictive scar from injury or surgery. It is important to recognize the intimate relationship of these 3 tissues (bone, soft tissue, and scar) when treating hand fractures. Fracture terminology precisely defines fracture type, location, and management strategy for hand fractures. These terms are reviewed, with emphasis on their operational definitions, as they relate to the course of therapy. The progression of motion protocols is dependent on the type of fracture healing, either primary or secondary, which in turn is determined by the method of fracture fixation. Current closed- and open-fixation methods for metacarpal and phalangeal fractures are addressed for each fracture location. The potential soft tissue problems that are often associated with each type of fracture are explained, with preventative methods of splinting and treatment. A comprehensive literature review is provided to compare evidence for practice in managing the variety of fracture patterns associated with metacarpal and phalangeal fractures, following closed- and open-fixation techniques. Emphasis is placed on initial hand positioning to protect the fracture reduction, exercise to maintain or regain joint range of motion, and specific tendon-gliding exercises to prevent restrictive adhesions, all of which are necessary to assure return of function post fracture.

### Pinckney fracture: do not underestimate trauma of the distal phalanx of the hallux [^115y7BBa]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

In most cases, the fracture is not severely displaced, and the reduction is easy or even unnecessary, requiring only comfort measurements such as syndactyly or partial weight bearing.

In some cases, such as late presentation and severe displacement, the fracture can be unstable and require a provisional Kirschner wire fixation to maintain the reduction. In other cases, soft-tissue interposition (eg, germinal matrix) dictates surgical exploration.

Treatment with antibiotics is required and the need for an initial intravenous therapy depends mainly on the clinical presentation. Patients with delayed treatment and infection signs require intraoperative cultures and benefit from initial intravenous antibiotic treatment. On the other side, for patients with early diagnosis a period of 5–7 days of oral antibiotics and close follow-up is accepted(typically, a first-generation cephalosporin or clindamycin). Immobilisation in a postoperative/hard-soled shoe for 4 weeks is recommended.

Learning points

Our case highlights the importance of being rigorous on radiographic evaluation. A true lateral and anteroposterior views are imperative for the correct diagnosis, especially in the presence of an occasional subtle presentation. When in doubt, compare with the contralateral foot.
Early recognition is the key for a favourable outcome. Identifying these cases as open fractures with a regimen of antibiotics lowers the risk of cellulitis and osteomyelitis.
Despite a negative radiographic evaluation, facing a nail outside the eponychium or a nail laceration, we should suspect of a physeal fracture; an open fracture must be assumed unless proven otherwise. When in doubt, treat it as an open injury.

### Six-week radiographic follow-up does not change management for nonoperatively treated extraarticular metacarpal shaft fractures [^113ntG8M]. Hand (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Metacarpal fractures are common and account for over 30% of all hand fractures. Previous literature has shown similar outcomes between operative and nonoperative management of metacarpal shaft fractures. There is little information regarding the natural history of conservatively managed metacarpal shaft fractures and changes in management based on follow-up radiographs.

Methods

A retrospective chart review was performed on all patients who presented to a single institution with an extraarticular metacarpal shaft or base fracture between 2015 and 2019.

Results

Thirty-one patients with 37 metacarpal fractures were included for review: average age 41 years, male 48%, right hand dominant 91%, and average follow-up duration 7.3 weeks. At follow-up, a change of 2.4° in angulation (P = 0.0005) and a change in shortening of 0.1 mm (P = 0.0386) were noted over the 6-week time interval. No fractures had malrotation at presentation, and none developed malrotation during the follow-up period.

Conclusions

Recent systematic reviews and meta-analysis have suggested that metacarpal fractures treated nonoperatively had similar outcomes to surgical fixation at 12 months of follow-up. We found that extraarticular metacarpal shaft fractures that do not meet operative indications at the initial visit should be expected to heal reliably with minimal change in angulation and shortening over time. The transition to removable brace or no brace at the 2-week follow-up is likely sufficient, and additional follow-up is not necessary and will reduce cost.

### Iatrogenic irreducible pediatric salter-harris II middle phalanx base fracture with dorsal dislocation of the proximal interphalangeal joint: a case report [^1129j3qA]. Hand (2025). Medium credibility.

Pediatric phalangeal Salter-Harris (SH)-type fracture dislocations are rare injuries that often require open reduction and stabilization. We present a case of a 14-year-old male who sustained an iatrogenic irreducible SH II dorsal fracture dislocation of the small-finger proximal interphalangeal joint (PIPJ) after an attempted closed reduction of a small-finger PIPJ dislocation by a community emergency medicine physician. Following the reduction attempt, the epiphysis was noted on radiographs to be rotated approximately 90° with persistent dorsal dislocation and an associated SH II fracture of the base of the middle phalanx. The patient was sent to our trauma center for further evaluation by our on-call hand surgeon and required open reduction and pinning of the fracture dislocation. To our knowledge, this pattern of iatrogenic PIPJ fracture dislocation has not been previously described in the literature. We outline the case presentation, treatment method, and learning points for both the on-call hand surgeon as well as the community emergency medicine physicians in this report.

### Implementation of the amsterdam pediatric wrist rules [^114QgPVG]. Pediatric Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Reduction in radiographs and clinically relevant missed fractures

The absolute reduction in radiographs was 19% (99% vs. 80%; chi-square test, P < 0.001) (Table 3). Eight fractures were missed following the recommendation of the Amsterdam Pediatric Wrist Rules (4.4%, Table 4). Only one of these patients received no wrist radiograph and this patient was contacted by phone after a week. The 12-year-old boy still complained about his wrist and he was invited to the outpatient clinic. A radiograph of the wrist was performed, which showed a Salter-Harris type II fracture (Online Resource 1). The patient was treated with a below-elbow plaster for 3 weeks, after which he had no residual complaints. This fracture was considered clinically relevant, since it was treated with a below-elbow plaster for 3 weeks. Among the seven other fractures, three fractures were judged clinically relevant (1.7%). Two fractures were epiphysiolysis fractures of the distal radius (Salter-Harris type II), which were both treated with a below-elbow plaster (Online Resources 2 and 3). One of these fractures, which occurred in a 10-year-old girl, was displaced and underwent closed reduction (Online Resource 3). The third clinically relevant fracture was a greenstick fracture with 8° of dorsal angulation (Online Resource 4). That 13-year-old boy was treated with a below-elbow plaster for 3 weeks. During immobilization, the angulation did not deteriorate. In all seven patients, the physicians had ignored the recommendation of the Amsterdam Pediatric Wrist Rules, which was to not perform a wrist radiograph. After implementation, the Amsterdam Pediatric Wrist Rules correctly identified 98% of all clinically relevant fractures (Table 5).

### Nonarticular base and shaft fractures of children's fingers: are follow-up X-rays needed? Retrospective study of conservatively treated proximal and middle phalangeal fractures [^116SknZ6]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Phalangeal fractures of the hand are common in children, and most extra-articular fractures can be treated with nonoperative management. Minimally or nondisplaced fractures may simply be immobilized, whereas displaced fractures need closed reduction before immobilization. Although few of these fractures displace secondarily, most schemes currently recommend follow-up x-rays after initial diagnosis. Our primary objective was to identify subgroups of finger fractures that are stable, thus requiring no radiographic monitoring.

Methods

This study was designed as a retrospective, single-center analysis of conservatively treated pediatric finger fractures of the proximal and middle phalanges. We included patients up to 16 years with base or shaft fractures of the index to little fingers who underwent nonoperative treatment and standardized follow-up controls in our pediatric hand surgery outpatients' clinic between 2010 and 2016. Fracture angular deformity in x-rays taken at diagnosis and after 1 and 3 weeks were reassessed blinded, and a statistical analysis was conducted to identify fracture types that are prone to secondary angular deformity.

Results

A total of 478 patients were eligible; 113 were lost due to missing final radiographic controls. Overall, 365 patients were analyzed; they had a mean age of 9.7 years (range, 1 to 16), and 33.4% required a primary closed reduction. A secondary angular deformity occurred in 2.2% (8/365) of all finger fractures. No secondary angulation occurred in primary minimally and nondisplaced fractures, but 6.6% (8/122) of the reduced fractures showed a subsequent loss of reduction.

Conclusions

Minimally angulated (< 10 degrees) and nondisplaced metaphyseal and diaphyseal fractures of proximal and middle phalanges of the index to little fingers are stable and therefore do not need radiographic follow-ups. However, initially angulated fractures requiring closed reduction bear a risk of subsequent loss of reduction.

Learning Objectives

After studying this article, the participant should be able to: 1. Understand the indications for metacarpal fixation. 2. Understand the rationale for various surgical treatment options, based on high-level evidence where available. 3. Describe selected operative techniques and their postoperative management.

Background

Metacarpal fractures are extremely common, constituting one in five fractures that present to the emergency department. Although many metacarpal fractures can be treated nonoperatively, some require surgery. The purpose of this CME article is to present a practical, up-to-date guide to the management of these common injuries.

Methods

A review of nonoperative management, surgical indications, and selected surgical techniques is provided. The authors reviewed the literature related to the treatment of metacarpal fractures, and the highest level evidence available to help guide decision-making is presented.

Conclusions

Metacarpal fractures can often be treated nonoperatively, although some fractures will benefit from surgical treatment. Although there is some high-level evidence to guide decision-making, there are many clinical scenarios for which there is little high-quality applicable research. As a general principle, the treatment option that achieves the desired reduction and degree of fixation, allows early motion, and minimizes soft-tissue injury should be preferred.

### Pediatric finger fractures: which ones turn ugly? [^113NdLas]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2012). Low credibility.

The majority of pediatric finger fractures can be treated by closed means with expected excellent outcomes. However, a subset of fractures can turn "ugly", with complications such as growth arrest, malunion, and joint dysfunction if not recognized and treated appropriately. The present paper discusses several fractures in a child's fingers that can cause substantial problems if not recognized promptly, highlighting important themes in the evaluation and treatment of a child's injured finger.

### Short term outcomes following open reduction internal fixation surgery for a distal radius fracture: 2 week versus 4 week immobilization. A retrospective analysis [^114YvySB]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

A distal radius fracture (DRF) is defined as a fracture occurring in the distal radius within 3 cm of the radio-carpal joint.DRF are one of the most common fractures that occur in adults, accounting for approximately 15% of all fractures. The incidence is increasing with an aging population. It is predicted that wrist fractures will increase by 25% in the next 4 years in people aged over 50. A large percentage of the annual health cost is utilized by DRF patients; as a result of the initial assessment and investigation, surgery, treatment materials, therapy costs and time at work lost. The determination of the most efficient and effective care available is of benefit to the patient and health provider combined.

Surgery offers an obvious increased potential risk of infection and soft tissue damage, therefore internal or external fixation is reserved for more complex injuries. Fracture fixation using a VLP is currently the most common surgical treatment for this population. Studies by McCamley et al, Wigg et al, Wilcke et al.and Rozental et al.have compared VLP to other fixation methods (external fixation, k wires, non-locking plates and bridging external fixation). These studies indicate that earlier function is obtained if a VLP is used surgically.

Early movement post surgery is beneficial in prevention of adherence of the tendons to the metal work or skin, reducing joint adhesions and finger stiffness, reducing neural tightness, and preventing unnecessary muscle atrophy. It has been shown that patients with finger stiffness (following a DRF) have a greater pain intensity score and disability than those without stiffness. Motion will aid reduction of swelling and stiffness that is a result of oedema. This enables the patient to experience a return of motion to the hand; improved motion will allow functional gains.

Therapy that is begun too early post surgery may disrupt the inflammatory phase and early proliferative phase of healing. Proliferation of the repair material peaks at approximately 2 to 3 weeks post surgery, this is when the bulk of the scar tissue is formed. Beginning motion around this time will allow the collagen to respond favorably to the mechanical stress applied to it. Delaying motion for longer than this period may result in adherence of the soft tissues and joint stiffness. The optimum period to begin therapy post fracture and fracture fixation remains inconclusive, despite several small studies.-

### Adequate union rates for the treatment of acute proximal fifth metatarsal fractures [^112tsHUe]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2021). Medium credibility.

Outcome measures

Tuberosity avulsion fractures (zone 1):

For zone 1, 711 fractures were included from 19 studies, of which 531 (74.7%) fractures were managed conservatively and 180 (25.3%) were managed surgically. Conservatively treated fractures were non-displaced in 267 (50.3%) cases, displaced in 77 (14.5%) cases, and unrecorded for 187 (35.1%) cases. Surgically treated fractures were displaced in 167 (92.8%) and non-displaced in 13 (7.2%). An overview of the pooled patient characteristics and pooled treatment outcomes is shown in Table 2. Overall, conservative treatment showed a lower pooled bone healing rate and pooled mean time to union compared to surgical treatment of 91.0% versus 96.1% and 8.5 weeks versus 7.6 weeks, respectively (Table 2). Pooled results from secondary outcome measures can be seen in Table 2. The effect of displacement on bone healing outcome showed that displaced tuberosity avulsion fractures had similar pooled bone union rates when treated surgically and conservatively (Table 3).

Distal radius fracture (DRF) interventions — initial protection and timing of mobilization are outlined as follows: nonoperatively managed individuals with DRF are typically immobilized in a cast for 4 to 6 weeks before they initiate wrist mobilization exercises; following DRF surgery (ie, open reduction internal fixation, external fixation, or percutaneous pinning), the early protective immobilization period is variable (ie, a few days to several weeks) depending on fracture healing and stability, as well as surgeon's preference; timing for initiating wrist exercises after surgery is not universally agreed upon and typically starts when the physician verifies that a satisfactory healing level has been attained via radiographic evidence and exercise loading can be safely imposed across the fracture site; once proper healing has occurred, 3 rehabilitation approaches have been proposed: SupT with advice for an iHEP, an iHEP alone, or no therapy.

Indications for fixation (geriatric patients) — distal radius fractures: Strong evidence suggests that operative treatment for geriatric patients (most commonly defined in studies as 65 years of age and older) does not lead to improved long-term patient reported outcomes compared to non-operative treatment, with Strength of Recommendation: Strong. Evidence description states evidence from two or more "High" quality studies with consistent findings for recommending for or against the intervention. The guideline draws on 2 high quality studies and 11 moderate quality studies comparing operative and nonoperative treatment in those > 65 years of age. Some studies demonstrated improvements in patient reported outcomes in the short term (usually less than 3 mo.), but studies consistently showed no difference in patient reported outcomes in the long-term (1 year or greater) despite improvements in radiographic parameters. Age is used as a proxy for functional demand; a high functioning patient with high functional demands, despite having an age greater than 65, may benefit from operative fixation, whereas there may be low functioning younger patients with low functional demands, despite having an age less than 65, that may benefit from non-operative treatment. Recommendations are principally based upon literature studying distal radius fracture as an isolated injury, and this clinical practice guideline uses age greater than 65 as this is what is used in the literature.

### Extra-articular fractures of the proximal phalanges of the fingers: a comparison of 2 methods of functional, conservative treatment [^116GXGgb]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose

For nonsurgical treatment of fractures of the proximal phalanges of the triphalangeal fingers, different dynamic casts have been described. The main principle behind these casts is advancement and tightening of the extensor hood, caused by a combination of blocking the metacarpophalangeal joints in flexion and actively flexing the proximal interphalangeal joints. In contrast to established treatment protocols using functional forearm casts, the Lucerne cast allows for free mobilization of the wrist joint. The purpose of the current multicenter study was to compare the results of conservative, functional treatment using 2 different methods, either a forearm cast or a Lucerne cast.

Methods

Over a 2-year-period, a prospective, randomized, multicenter study was conducted at 4 hospitals in Switzerland. Clinical and radiological results of 66 consecutive patients having 75 extra-articular fractures of the proximal phalanges were recorded through a minimum follow-up of 3 months. Intra-articular and physeal fractures, pathological fractures, open fractures, concomitant injuries of the tendons or collateral ligaments, and accidents more than 7 days before presentation were excluded from the study.

Results

Radiographically, there were no statistically significant differences between the 2 groups in terms of palmar apex angulation and radial or ulnar angulation. There were no differences in total active range of finger motion. Wrist joint motion at the time of cast removal was statistically superior in patients treated with Lucerne cast. However, there were no significant differences in wrist joint motion at 12 weeks of follow-up.

Conclusions

The clinical and radiological results achieved with the Lucerne cast are comparable to those of established treatment. Well-reduced, minimally angulated, or nonangulated fractures of the proximal phalanges of the fingers can be effectively treated using functional casts without immobilizing the wrist.

### Operative fractures of the phalangeal head and neck in children-does open reduction affect outcomes? [^1118BxFC]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2023). Medium credibility.

Hand fractures are common in the pediatric population, comprising an estimated 15% of fractures seen in the emergency department, and of these fractures, most occur in the phalanges.–10 percent to 15% of pediatric phalangeal fractures are phalangeal head or neck sub-types.–

Pediatric phalangeal neck fractures are described as inherently unstable with poor remodeling potential because they occur at the distal end of the phalanges, away from the physis. Al-Qattan originally described and developed a classification and treatment algorithm for phalangeal neck fractures, with Type I being nondisplaced, Type II displaced with bony contact, and Type III displaced without any bony contact (Fig. 1). He recommended pin fixation for unstable, displaced Type II and all Type III fractures, with a strong preference for open reduction. Most displaced phalangeal head and neck fractures in children are treated with closed reduction and percutaneous pinning (CRPP), but if healing and early callus render closed reduction impossible, these fractures require anatomic reduction with either open or percutaneous osteoclasis and percutaneous pinning. Additional indications for open reduction include failure of conservative treatment, unsuccessful closed reduction, and delayed presentation with impending malunion.

Phalangeal head and neck fractures occur in a vascular watershed area of the bone, and disruptions of the blood supply are a concern for both closed versus open pinning procedures. Fortunately, avascular necrosis (AVN) is a rare complication following a phalangeal neck fracture. Risk factors for AVN include open fractures, Al-Qattan type III fractures, open reduction of closed fractures, and multiple unskilled attempts at closed reduction. The rate of AVN following either open or closed treatment of these pediatric fractures is currently unknown. We hypothesize that subjects with open injuries would display higher rates of osteonecrosis and poorer postsurgical outcomes than subjects with closed injuries requiring open reduction or those treated with CRPP.

### Evaluation of a diagnostic-therapeutic algorithm for finger epiphyseal growth plate stress injuries in adolescent climbers [^111YYSW7]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Finger epiphyseal growth plate stress injuries are the most frequent sport-specific injuries in adolescent climbers. Definitive diagnostic and therapeutic guidelines are pending.

Purpose

To evaluate a diagnostic-therapeutic algorithm for finger epiphyseal growth plate stress injuries in adolescent climbers.

Study Design

Case series; Level of evidence, 4.

Methods

On the basis of previous work on diagnostics and treatment of finger epiphyseal growth plate stress injuries (EGPIs) in adolescent climbers, we developed a new algorithm for management of these injuries, which was implemented into our clinical work. During a 4-year period, we performed a prospective multicentered analysis of our patients treated according to the algorithm. Climbing-specific background was evaluated (training years, climbing level, training methods, etc); injuries were analyzed (Salter-Harris classification and UIAA MedCom score [Union Internationale des Associations d'Alpinisme]); and treatments and outcomes were recorded: union, time to return to climbing, VAS (visual analog scale), QuickDASH (shortened version of the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand), and a climbing-specific outcome score.

Results

Within the observation period, 27 patients with 37 independent EGPIs of the fingers were recorded (mean ± SD age, 14.7 ± 1.5 years; 19 male, 8 female; 66.7% competitive athletes). Regarding maturity at time of injury, the mean age at injury did not differ by sex. Average UIAA climbing level was 9.5 ± 0.8, with 6 ± 4.6 years of climbing or bouldering and 14 ± 9.1 hours of weekly climbing-specific training volume. Among the 37 injuries there were 7 epiphyseal strains, 2 Salter-Harris I fractures, and 28 Salter-Harris III fractures (UIAA 1, n = 7; UIAA 2, n = 30). Thirty-six injuries developed through repetitive stress, while 1 had an acute onset. Twenty-eight injuries were treated nonoperatively and 9 surgically. Osseous union was achieved in all cases, and there were no recurrences. The time between the start of treatment and the return to sport was 40.1 ± 65.2 days. The climbing-specific outcome score was excellent in 34 patients and good in 3. VAS decreased from 2.3 ± 0.6 to 0.1 ± 0.4 after treatment and QuickDASH from 48.1 ± 7.9 to 28.5 ± 3.3.

Conclusion

The proposed management algorithm led to osseous union in all cases. Effective treatment of EGPIs of the fingers may include nonsurgical or surgical intervention, depending on the time course and severity of the injury. Further awareness of EGPI is important to help prevent these injuries in the future.

### Pediatric phalanx fractures: unique challenges and pitfalls [^1168ASxM]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2006). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

The hand is the most frequently injured part of the body in children. Most pediatric hand fractures can be treated by nonoperative means with good results. However, a subset of fractures requires prompt recognition and surgical intervention. We will review several pediatric phalangeal fracture types that must be recognized and treated appropriately to minimize complications and disability. These injuries defy the general conception that pediatric fractures universally do well with minimal intervention. This paper highlights two important concepts: (1) phalangeal fractures in children can differ considerably from other pediatric fractures, and (2) phalangeal fractures in children can be very different from those in adults. Tolerance of displacement may be small in juxtaarticular or intraarticular fractures and healing is rapid in phalangeal fractures, allowing displaced fractures to develop into malunions in a short period of time, with resultant deformity and dysfunction. Careful clinical examination of any suspected phalanx fracture in children is essential to appropriate treatment of these potentially problematic injuries, including adequate radiographic evaluation with multiple views of the suspected fracture site and thorough examination of possible open injuries.

### Common finger fractures and dislocations [^116tLvG1]. American Family Physician (2022). Medium credibility.

Finger fractures and dislocations are commonly seen in the primary care setting. Patients typically present with a deformity, swelling, and bruising with loss of function. Anteroposterior, lateral, and oblique radiography should be performed to identify fractures and distinguish uncomplicated injuries from those requiring referral. Uncomplicated distal phalanx fractures, caused by a crush injury to the end of the finger, require splinting of the distal interphalangeal joint for four to six weeks. Uncomplicated dorsal avulsion fractures (mallet finger) of the distal interphalangeal joint, caused by forced flexion against resistance, require strict splint immobilization for eight weeks. Flexor digitorum profundus fractures are caused by forceful extension of the distal interphalangeal joint when in a flexed position, resulting in an avulsion fracture at the volar base of the distal phalanx, and usually require surgery. Uncomplicated middle and proximal phalanx fractures, typically caused by a direct blow, can be treated with buddy splinting if there is minimal angulation (less than 10 degrees); however, larger angulations, displacement, and malrotation often require reduction or surgery. Dorsal proximal interphalangeal joint dislocations require reduction and buddy splinting in slight flexion with an extension-block splint. Volar proximal interphalangeal joint dislocations require reduction and splinting in full extension for four to six weeks. Distal interphalangeal joint dislocations require reduction and splinting in full extension (for volar dislocations) or 15 to 30 degrees of flexion (for dorsal dislocations) for two to three weeks. Dorsal metacarpophalangeal joint dislocations are managed with reduction and splitting, but referral to an orthopedic specialist is required if the dislocation is not easily reduced. Volar metacarpophalangeal dislocations are rare and warrant referral.

Fixation technique — distal radius fractures: Strong evidence suggests no significant difference in radiographic or patient reported outcomes between fixation techniques for complete articular or unstable distal radius fractures, although volar locking plates lead to earlier recovery of function in the short term (3 months). Strength of Recommendation: Strong. Description notes evidence from two or more high-quality studies. The guideline is based upon 6 high quality studies; early in recovery the 2 studies that compared volar locked plating showed more rapid functional recovery, but at longer term follow up there were no significant differences in radiographic or patient reported outcomes, and among studies with results at 12 months or longer there was no difference in patient reported outcomes at final follow-up.

### Staged external fixation for chronic fracture-dislocation of the proximal interphalangeal joint: outcomes of patients with a minimum 2-year follow-up [^113SwrMw]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose

To introduce a new surgical strategy for chronic fracture-dislocations of the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint with 2-staged external fixation. We also assessed the results of this method in all of our patients with at least 2 years of follow-up.

Methods

We used the procedure in 6 cases. For the first step, we applied mini external fixators for 1 week before surgery to apply traction to the PIP joint with sufficient force to stretch the dislocated joint components. The second procedure was surgical release of the PIP joint and an attempt at percutaneous reduction and fixation. This was not possible in 4 cases, and we performed an open reduction and corrective osteotomy. Postoperative early rehabilitation was achieved under controlled movement using an external fixator that allowed PIP joint flexion and extension.

Results

At long-term follow-up (mean, 3.5 y), the range of movement of PIP joints had increased by 76°, and that of distal interphalangeal joints by 35°. Osteochondral remodeling likely occurred not only while the joint was protected with the dynamic external fixator during a 12-week period (range, 8–14 wk), but also after removal.

Conclusions

Preoperative traction softens the PIP joint, facilitating both surgery and rehabilitation. Postoperative early exercise with controlled movement, while maintaining concentric reduction with the external fixator, may accelerate osteochondral repair of the injured PIP joint.

### Non-operative management of metacarpal II-IV fractures: a retrospective study from a tertiary hand unit [^117GN5Hn]. Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive & Aesthetic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Metacarpal fractures produce significant hand disability, and non-operative management of these fractures can produce satisfactory functional outcomes with few complications. However, most studies assessing non-operative outcomes of metacarpal fractures revolves around metacarpals I and V, which possess different anatomy. Therefore, further investigation into outcomes after non-operative treatment of metacarpals II-IV is required to inform management decisions and allow modification of the rehabilitation protocols to specific fracture patterns. All records for 76 non-operative patients presenting with fractures of metacarpals II-IV to our tertiary centre in the year 2019 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were treated with thermoplastic splinting or fibreglass casting with a rehabilitative exercise programme. Range of motion (ROM) of the Metacarpophalangeal (MCPJ), Proximal Interphalangeal (PIPJ), and Distal Interphalangeal joints (DIPJ), return to work time, and complications were assessed at 12 weeks post-treatment. Mean return to work time was 5.4 weeks, and patients did not report any serious adverse events; the main complication reported was tenderness on palpation (20%). The MCPJ exhibited the poorest ROM (9° flexion reduction relative to the healthy hand). Metacarpal II fractures were associated with significantly worse MCPJ flexion than metacarpal III (p = 0.022) and metacarpal IV (p = 0.049) fractures. Fractures of the metacarpal base were associated with superior MCPJ flexion (p = 0.004) but longer return to work time (p = 0.042) than head fractures. Spiral fractures were associated with shorter return to work time (p = 0.043) and superior ROM results (p = 0.041). In conclusion, outcomes of the non-operative treatment of metacarpal II-IV fractures are highly dependent on the location and pattern of the fracture, and this should be considered during clinical decision making.

### Fixation of hand fractures with bicortical screws [^116hjjE9]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose

Traditionally a compression lag screw technique has been described when screw fixation alone is used to fix phalangeal or metacarpal fractures. The purpose of this retrospective case review was to determine whether there is any disadvantage to using a bicortical screw technique instead of the compression screw technique.

Methods

Thirty-seven fractures of the phalanges and metacarpals in 36 patients had open reduction and internal fixation. Fixation was achieved with minifragment, self-tapping screws only, which were applied with bicortical fixation rather than a lag technique. Data were obtained through medical record and radiographic review. Intraoperative and immediate postoperative x-rays were compared with final x-rays. Fracture healing, confirmed radiographically, was used to determine whether the bicortical screw technique was adequate for fixation.

Results

All fractures healed by an average of 7 weeks (range, 4–10 wk) without loss of fixation or malunion.

Conclusions

Based on this experience we believe bicortical fixation is a straightforward technique and provides adequate fracture stability and healing.

### Surgical approaches to the proximal interphalangeal joint [^117Y75oz]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

The proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint may be affected by many conditions such as arthropathy, fractures, dislocations, and malunions. Whereas some of these conditions may be treated nonsurgically, many require open surgical intervention. Open interventions include implant arthroplasty or arthrodesis for arthropathy, open reduction internal fixation, or hemi-hamate arthroplasty for dorsal fracture-dislocations. Volar plate arthroplasty and corrective osteotomy for malunion about the PIP joint are also surgeries that may be required. The traditional approach to the PIP joint has been dorsal, which damages the delicate extensor apparatus with subsequent development of an extensor lag. This has led surgeons to explore volar and lateral approaches to the PIP joint. In this article, we describe each of these surgical approaches, discuss their advantages and disadvantages, and provide some guidance on which approach to choose based on the surgery that is to be performed.

### Pediatric and adolescent forearm fractures: current controversies and treatment recommendations [^116rmadF]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2016). Low credibility.

Pediatric and adolescent forearm fractures continue to present treatment challenges. Despite high-level evidence to the contrary, traditional guidelines for nonsurgical treatment have been challenged in favor of surgical intervention, but it is unclear if this results in improved outcomes. Recent evidence suggests that certain open fractures in children may be successfully treated nonsurgically. Good results have been achieved with closed reduction and appropriate casting and clinical follow-up. Further research investigating functional outcomes into adulthood is needed.

Material and methods

The preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses statement (PRISMA) was used as a guideline for the present study. The study protocol was prospectively registered in the PROSPERO registry for systematic reviews with registry number: CRD42019122682.

Search strategy

Studies from the earliest record (June 1902), until January 2019 were retrieved from EMBASE (Ovid), MEDLINE via PubMed, CINAHL, and Web of Science. The search strategy can be reviewed in the supplementary materials 2.

Eligibility criteria and study selection

All randomized controlled trials (RCTs), controlled non-randomized trials, prospective-, and retrospective cohorts, comparative studies and case series that investigated conservative and/or surgical treatment of the acute proximal fifth metatarsal fracture types as proposed by Lawrence and Botte (see Fig. 1) were included. Case series were only included if they included 10 or more participants per treatment or fracture group. Furthermore, papers written in English, French, German and Dutch were eligible for inclusion. The exclusion criteria are listed in Table 1. Fracture acuteness was defined by each article's respective author. Additionally, Torg 1 fractures were included as acute fractures. No patient age, demographic or publication date restrictions were applied. Moreover, backward citation searching was used to find additional eligible articles. Authors were contacted by email if results were unclear for multiple anatomical locations or if results were combined between acute and stress fractures to enable separated datasets. If no response was recorded following two reminder emails, the respective author's paper was thereafter excluded. Two authors (Q.R. and J.D.) independently screened titles and abstracts, and full-text articles with predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria as stated above, using Covidence. Disagreement was resolved by an attempt to reach consensus. If no consensus was reached a third reviewer (N.H.) was decisive.

### A comparison of casting versus splinting for nonoperative treatment of pediatric phalangeal neck fractures [^114ajexX]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Phalangeal neck fractures account for 13% of pediatric finger fractures. Al Qattan type I (undisplaced) fractures are treated nonoperatively. There is increasing evidence that Type 2 (displaced) fractures achieve remarkable fracture remodeling with nonoperative treatment and patients frequently make a full functional recovery. The options available for nonoperative management of these fractures are either a plaster cast or a removable splint. We hypothesized that there would be no significant difference in radiologic outcome in pediatric phalangeal neck fractures (Types I and II) treated with splint or cast immobilization.

Methods

This is a retrospective study of patients aged 18 and below with phalangeal neck fractures treated nonoperatively from 2008 to 2017. Radiographs were compared at < 1 week and > 3 weeks after injury. Translation and angulation in coronal and sagittal planes were measured and compared using Student t tests. Baseline variables were compared using χ or Fisher exact tests.

Results

There were 47 patients with phalangeal neck fractures treated nonoperatively during the study period. There were 9 type I and 38 type II fractures. The mean age was 10 years with 40 males and 7 females. Fractures occurred in 33 dominant and 14 nondominant hands and involved 29 proximal and 18 middle phalanges. Nineteen children were treated in casts and 28 with removable splints. The mean duration of follow-up was similar between the 2 groups. The most affected phalanx was the proximal phalanx of the small finger and the most common fracture pattern was type IIA. There was no significant difference in clinical and radiologic outcomes between children who were treated in casts and those treated in removable splints.

Conclusion

There was no difference in the clinical and radiologic outcomes in pediatric phalangeal neck fractures treated with cast or splint immobilization. Splinting has the added benefits of increased comfort and hygiene and we routinely offer splinting as a viable alternative in the nonoperative treatment of Al Qattan type I and type II phalangeal fractures.

### Surgical management of proximal interphalangeal joint repetitive stress epiphyseal fracture nonunion in elite sport climbers [^116TT2if]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Repetitive stress fracture of the middle phalanx epiphysis is an injury specific to elite adolescent sport climbers. As sport climbing becomes increasingly popular in younger age groups, an increased number of these injuries have been reported in recent years. To date, treatment of these fractures has been nonsurgical, with strict rest and physiotherapy prescribed until fracture union. However, when these patients present in a delayed fashion with an established nonunion, nonsurgical treatment may fail, leading to disabling chronic pain and/or digital deformity in some cases. In this article, we present 2 cases of surgical treatment for finger middle phalanx repetitive stress epiphyseal fracture nonunion, using a percutaneous spot drilling epiphysiodesis technique.

### Remodeling of salter-harris type II epiphyseal plate injury of the distal radius [^116xpYEF]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2004). Low credibility.

The authors studied the relation between residual angulation at the time of healing and final orientation of the distal radius as well as the clinical outcome in patients after Salter-Harris type II epiphyseal plate injury of the distal radius. Eighty-five patients were reviewed with a median follow-up of 8.5 years. Anteroposterior and lateral radiographs were taken at follow-up. The mobility of both wrists and forearms was examined, together with grip strength. Pain with activities and sports was evaluated. At follow-up, 73 patients (86%) were anatomically normal on radiographs; the remaining 12 patients had an incomplete remodeling of the volar and/or radial inclination of the distal radius. Premature closure of the growth plate in the distal radius or ulna did not occur in any of these children. Complete remodeling was seen in children aged up to 10 years in all but one patient. Remodeling after Salter-Harris type II epiphyseal plate injury occurs in all age groups, but the potential is greater in children up to 10 years of age. The incomplete remodeling does not seem to have any substantial long-term negative effect on mobility of the wrist and grip strength.

Outcome and follow-up

The early management of this lesion, after discharge, required a close follow-up and a course of oral antibiotics. During the follow-up, the patient presented no clinical or radiographic signs of osteomyelitis which is considered the major complication, especially on the delayed treated lesions.

At the last outpatient follow-up, 1-year postinjury, the patient did not present any signs of early physeal arrest, neither pain with weight-bearing nor compromised normal function (figure 5).

### Tendon and ligament injuries of the finger and thumb in athletes: a narrative review [^114SzK2E]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Early immobilisation is the primary conservative treatment for central slip injuries. Splinting regimens should involve PIP joint extension for a period of 6 weeks to allow for healing of the central slip to the middle phalanx, followed by another 6 weeks of nighttime splinting. Compared with operative management in a cohort of 33 adult patients treated within 6 weeks of injury, this 12-week splinting regimen achieved satisfactory results (> 80% of normal flexion at PIP joint and/or 'summated flexion') in 75% of patients undergoing conservative treatment compared with 35% undergoing operative management. Operative management is required for central slip injuries with accompanying PIP joint dorsal lip fracture fragments with > 2 mm of displacement, ventral (palmar) lip fractures involving > 50% of the articular surface, associated volar dislocations with or without fractures or open laceration of the central slip. If a central slip injury is left untreated, the patient runs a risk of developing a boutonnière deformity (figure 1). Splinting should allow for daily DIP joint flexion exercises, which may help prevent and treat boutonnière deformities by promoting dorsal positioning of the lateral bands. Persistent boutonnière deformity may necessitate repair of the central slip and/or adjusting the positions of the lateral bands.

Flexor digitorum profundus injury

Injury to the flexor digitorum profundus (FDP) or 'Jersey finger' occurs when a sudden forced extension is applied to a flexed DIP joint (eg, finger catches an opponent's jersey), resulting in avulsion from its insertion in the distal phalanx (figure 2). The fourth finger is affected 62% of the time, which may be explained by the weaker FDP tendon insertion in the distal phalanx of the fourth finger compared with the third finger.FDP injury results in an inability to flex the DIP joint with a tendency to be slightly extended in comparison to other unaffected digits at a resting position. This injury may be further assessed by performing the distal forearm squeeze test (figure 3, online supplemental video 2). Concurrent flexor digitorum superficialis tendon injury is rare, however, if suspected, an ultrasound may be useful to diagnose this injury, which may impact management (eg, surgical planning).

### A percutaneous triple K-wire fixation technique for nascent malunion of proximal interphalangeal joint fracture-dislocation: a case series with an assessment of functional outcome [^116tPwcL]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Fracture-dislocations of the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint are difficult to manage. In the case of a 2- to 4-week delay in definitive treatment, a nascent malunion may result. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of the percutaneous triple K-wire technique for treatment of the PIP joint nascent malunion.

Methods

We treated 13 patients with nascent malunion of PIP joint fracture-dislocations using the percutaneous triple K-wire fixation technique based on the principle of soft callus manipulation to achieve congruity and reduction in the joint. The study included cases where the percentage of articular involvement exceeded 40% and in whom there was a minimum follow-up of 12 months. At the final follow-up, we measured the range of motion at the PIP joint. The Ishida and Ikuta scores were determined.

Results

The mean period between injury and surgery was 17.2 days. The average follow-up time was 14.2 months. The mean active arc of motion before surgery in the PIP joint was 15 degrees and that at the final follow-up was 83 degrees. Seven patients achieved excellent outcomes according to the Ishida and Ikuta scores. The final postoperative range of motion at the PIP joint was comparable with that reported in the literature for patients who underwent different procedures.

Conclusions

This procedure can be considered a viable alternative to open reduction and plating, hemihamate arthroplasty, and ligamentotaxis with distraction, particularly in the presence of nascent malunion.

### Fractures of the fifth metatarsal in children and adolescents [^1124sP2U]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

Fractures of the fifth metatarsal are the most common metatarsal fractures in children. Their treatment is based on the adult literature. The purpose of our study was to identify the different types of fifth metatarsal fractures, to determine the mean time to healing, and to examine whether current adult recommendations can be extrapolated to children and adolescents.

Methods

A total of 103 patients met the inclusion criteria. The fractures were classified according to location. Type I represented an apophyseal injury. Type II represented tubercle fractures with intra-articular extension. Type III injuries represented Jones fracture. Metatarsal neck and shaft fractures were included separately.

Results

Apophyseal fractures did well with a short-leg walking cast for 3 to 6 weeks. Displaced intraarticular fractures had a significant delay in healing versus nondisplaced ones. Jones fractures had delays in healing if not treated surgically. Neck and shaft fractures did well with casting.

Conclusions

Most fractures of the fifth metatarsal in the pediatric population do well clinically after a course of walking cast, unless the fracture is an intra-articular displaced fracture type or the fracture occurs in the proximal diaphyseal area. Fixation of Jones fractures in active adolescents should be considered to allow faster return to regular activities and prevent refracture. We recommend non-weight bearing casts for all angulated or displaced intra-articular injuries to avoid delays in healing and angulation. From our series, it is evident that most pediatric fifth metatarsal fractures behave as those found in adults and can be treated similarly.

### Effects of fusion angle on functional results following non-operative treatment for fracture of the neck of the fifth metacarpal [^112NakMT]. Injury (2008). Low credibility.

Aim

To investigate in fractures of the fifth metacarpal neck whether there is any difference in functional results of non-operative treatments with dorsal angulation either below or above 30 degrees.

Methods

After closed reduction, fractures were treated with plaster splints for 5 weeks. Cases were divided into two groups, with dorsal angulation either below (group 1) or above (group 2) 30 degrees, according to oblique radiography, and were evaluated at 6 months. Grip strength, range of passive joint movement and distance from fingertip to distal crease were measured and compared. A scoring system assessed function, and occupational adequacy, patient satisfaction and presence of pain were recorded.

Results

Functional outcome was good or very good in both groups and occupational adequacy was not reduced in any case. Full patient satisfaction was achieved except for one person in group 1 and two people in group 2, regarding cosmetic results. There was no statistically significant difference between the two hands in either group except for one man from group 2, who had mild pain during coercive use of the injured hand.

Conclusions

With non-operative treatment of fractures of the neck of the fifth metacarpal, similar results were achieved with dorsal angulation either above or below 30 degrees. A dorsal angulation less than 45 degrees may be treated conservatively.

The American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons and the American Society for Surgery of the Hand released updated Clinical Practice Guidelines in 2020 on the evaluation and treatment of acute distal radius fractures. Following a rigorous methodology designed and implemented through the AAOS, 7 guidelines based upon the best available evidence were released to assist surgeons and physicians managing distal radius fractures. These guidelines can serve as a reference for surgeons when managing patients with distal radius fractures. We review the evidence behind each guideline and highlight the practical implications of each guideline on care.

### Percutaneous reduction and fixation of displaced phalangeal neck fractures in children [^113S9WcU]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Several methods have been reported for fixation of displaced phalangeal neck fractures in children. The purpose of this study is to present a technique for the closed reduction and percutaneous fixation of displaced phalangeal neck fractures and the clinical results of 4 patients treated by this method.

Methods

Four consecutive patients with displaced phalangeal neck fractures were treated with closed reduction and single intramedullary Kirschner wire placed percutaneously with a novel technique.

Results

The average age at injury was 5 years 9 months (range, 23 mo to 10 y). Three patients were male and 1 was female. Two patients had fractures of the proximal phalangeal neck, whereas the other 2 had fractures of the middle phalangeal neck. After an average follow-up of 18 weeks, all patients had nearly full pain-free flexion and extension of the affected digit.

Conclusions

The described technique is a simple, reproducible and effective treatment for displaced phalangeal neck fractures in children.

### Boutonniere versus pseudoboutonniere deformities: pathoanatomy, diagnosis, and treatment [^111U5w5E]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Finger injuries involving the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint are common, particularly among athletes. Injury severity is often underappreciated at initial presentation and may be dismissed broadly as a "jammed finger" injury. Delayed diagnosis and treatment of certain injuries can have an important impact on the patient's chance of regaining full function. Central slip and PIP volar plate injuries are frequently encountered injuries that, if left untreated, can lead to the permanent loss of function of the proximal interphalangeal joint. Despite the differing mechanisms of these 2 pathologies, volar plate hyperextension injuries often present with a PIP joint flexion contracture and mild distal interphalangeal joint hyperextension deformity. This is similar to a boutonniere deformity seen after an injury to the central slip, and thus, has been referred to as a "pseudo-boutonnière" deformity. Distinguishing these 2 diagnoses is important, as treatment differs, and highlights the importance of thoroughly understanding the anatomy and relevant clinical applications when evaluating PIP joint injuries.

### Functional treatment of physeal and periphyseal injuries of the metacarpal and proximal phalangeal bones [^114t9tRo]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2001). Low credibility.

Background/Purpose

Hand fractures are common injuries in infants. Complications are rare because of potent remodeling dimension and rapid healing of growing bone. There is limited remodeling capacity for angular and rotational deformity so displaced fractures often require open reduction and internal fixation.

Methods

The authors present a splint system for a protected reduction and mobilization program of displaced proximal phalanx and metacarpal fractures. The custom-molded 2-component thermoplastic splint allows motion of the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) and distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints. It has been developed to allow bone healing and recovery of motion at the same time. In this study, the authors evaluated the clinical and radiologic results of a series of 11 consecutive infants with displaced metacarpal fractures and 13 displaced proximal phalanx fractures who received functional treatment.

Results

Fracture consolidation and full active motion was achieved simultaneously in 4 weeks in 21 children; 2 infants required physiotherapy, and 1 child was lost to follow-up. No further growth abnormality was seen within a 12-month observation period.

Conclusion

When there is no damage of soft tissue the functional mobilization program can lead to good results treating displaced physeal and periphyseal hand injuries of proximal phalanx and metacarpal fractures. J Pediatr Surg 36:611–615.

### A novel splint for proximal interphalangeal joint contractures: a case report [^1176hfWR]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2012). Low credibility.

Proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint contractures are notoriously difficult to treat. Best results are obtained with early mobilization and splinting, though a high level of adherence is critical for a good outcome. A new roll-on splint that aims to increase motion with minimal difficulty was used. The patient described here with moderate PIP joint contractures (30°-60°) was treated successfully using this splint. The splint design and therapy protocol are described. The patient was treated for 12 weeks with good adherence to therapy and splinting. Total active motion increased by 87% in the index finger and 108% in the ring finger. Grip, pinch, and tip-pinch strengths increased. The Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand score improved from 26.7% to 2.5%. At 3 months, the patient returned to work. Though this case illustrates some of the advantages and disadvantages of the new splint, further study is necessary to evaluate the splint and compare it with other existing forms of treatment for PIP joint contractures.

### General approach to finger… [^1166yQyC]. AAFP (2012). Low credibility.

MANAGEMENT Management of finger injuries begins with closed reduction of the fracture or dislocation, if indicated. Stability of the reduction is assessed by gentle active flexion of the involved finger; the joint should be stable through flexion and extension. Rotation is assessed after a finger fracture by active flexion; there should be no digital overlap. All fingernail beds should point toward the thenar eminence. Stabilization is often achieved with splinting. Postreduction radiography can be used to assess alignment. If there is instability or significant rotation, referral to a hand surgeon is required. Reduction of a dorsal PIP dislocation should be attempted at the time of injury, if possible, by applying traction and volar pressure on the middle phalanx at the PIP joint. Successful relocation produces immediate relief of discomfort and resolution of the deformity. Reduction is often successful without anesthesia.

A local joint block can be considered if significant pain impedes reduction. The possibility of concomitant fracture or soft tissue injury must be considered, especially if relocation is unsuccessful. Radiography should be performed before further reduction attempts. Traditional treatment following reduction of uncomplicated dorsal PIP joint dislocations is splinting for one to two weeks followed by buddy taping for another one to two weeks. The benefits of early range of motion following relocation of a dorsal PIP dislocation are debated. A study showed an increase in range of motion and intrinsic muscle strength following four weeks of splinting with daily active exercise compared with immobilization alone. can be accompanied by avulsion of the central slip extensor mechanism of the PIP. Central slip injury can lead to the inability to extend the finger at the PIP joint and hyperflexion or boutonnière deformity over time.

11 These injuries should be splinted for six weeks in full PIP extension to avoid chronic deformity at the PIP joint. Fractures Several types of fractures can involve the phalanx or the intra-articular surface. Failure to identify and appropriately treat these fractures can lead to long-term reduced function and disability. Treatment of a mallet fracture includes splinting the DIP joint in extension for eight weeks. It is imperative that extension is maintained at all times during treatment because any flexion can affect healing and may extend the treatment period. Radiography must be performed following splint application to confirm congruity of the fracture fragment with the distal phalanx in the joint space.

### Acute finger injuries: part I. tendons and ligaments… [^112VQQrh]. AAFP (2006). Low credibility.

4, 7, 10 Bony avulsion fractures are present in one third of patients with mallet finger. 11, 12 If no avulsion fracture is present on radiographs, the DIP joint should be splinted in a neutral or slight hyper-extension position for six weeks. 13; the PIP joint should remain mobile. A Cochrane review 14, 15 confirmed that all available splints achieve similar results. Furthermore, the use of surgical wires did not improve clinical outcomes. 14, 15 Figure 3 describes different types of splints. 15 showed that patient compliance is the most important factor in the success of splint treatments. The distal phalanx should be supported during splint changes. 16 This is difficult to achieve alone, and the patient may need to return to the physician's office for splint changes. Necrosis of the skin can occur if the DIP joint is overextended during splinting.

If the skin blanches, the DIP joint is overextended. Allowing the skin to "breathe" for 10 to 20 minutes between splint changes minimizes the risk of maceration. Patients may continue to participate in athletic events during the splinting period, and physicians should follow up with patients every two weeks to ensure compliance. After six weeks of splinting, the joint should be reexamined. If active extension is present, splinting can be limited to when the patient is sleeping and during athletic events for another six weeks. can be used to treat PIP injuries, except for the stack splint, which is used only for DIP injuries. As with mallet finger, extension of the PIP joint must be maintained continuously. If full passive extension is not possible, the physician should refer the patient to an orthopedic or hand surgeon.

Patients with PIP joint injuries may continue to participate in athletic events during the splinting period, although some sports are difficult to play with a fully-extended PIP joint. Splinting duration is the same as with mallet finger. starting at 30 degrees of flexion 7, 22 for two to four weeks, depending on injury severity; buddy taping should follow. Increasing the extension of a dorsal aluminum splint weekly will progressively increase range of motion. 22 In less severe injuries, the injured joint should be buddy taped.
