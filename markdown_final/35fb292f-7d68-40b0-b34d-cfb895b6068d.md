## Question

Which medications are used to treat vertigo?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which medications are used to treat vertigo. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying that treatment is diagnosis-specific, not "one drug fits all". Then, I should verify diagnostic priorities and first-line nonpharmacologic maneuvers. Next, I will examine vestibular suppressants for short-term control, including their risks in older adults. After that, I need to review etiology-specific pharmacotherapy for BPPV, Ménière's disease, vestibular neuritis, and vestibular migraine, and cross-check the strength of evidence. Finally, I will integrate duration limits, safety monitoring, and the role of vestibular rehabilitation into a practical decision framework [^1119ZDtn] [^113nn1Ln] [^113gwVdV] [^11166QYo].

> Let me first confirm the core principle: vertigo treatment is condition-specific, and medications that suppress vestibular function are not universally indicated and may be harmful if misapplied. Wait, let me verify BPPV first — guidelines emphasize canalith repositioning maneuvers as first-line and specifically recommend against routine vestibular suppressants, while Ménière's guidelines allow a limited course of suppressants for acute attacks, neuritis guidance suggests shared decision-making regarding early corticosteroids, and vestibular migraine care aligns with migraine-directed acute and preventive strategies amid low-certainty data [^1119ZDtn] [^113tBP8i] [^116QTGJX] [^113nn1Ln] [^113gwVdV] [^114WD9Ms] [^111XjhXC].

> I will now examine diagnostic priorities because they determine whether medications are appropriate at all. Hold on, I should verify that bedside maneuvers are front and center: the Dix-Hallpike maneuver is recommended to diagnose posterior canal BPPV, canalith repositioning should be performed when positive, and routine vestibular testing is discouraged in straightforward BPPV cases; in parallel, careful bedside neuro-otologic exams such as HINTS help distinguish peripheral from central causes before prescribing symptomatic drugs that could mask red flags [^114FPKMQ] [^116QTGJX] [^112SULQL] [^1132xzrG].

> Next, I should review vestibular suppressants for acute symptom control, but I need to ensure I do not overstate benefits. Antihistamines and benzodiazepines can reduce short-term vertigo severity in acute settings, yet high-quality meta-analytic data suggest uncertain benefits beyond the first hours and risks of sedation, while benzodiazepines may be inferior to antihistamines for functional outcomes and carry dependence and fall risks, especially in older adults; observational data show a markedly higher hazard of injurious falls after vestibular suppressant prescriptions in patients with dizziness, underscoring the need to limit use and duration [^116RAx4B] [^113r4nZ9] [^115WCNzR] [^114AdY7k].

> Let me check BPPV specifically, because this is where mistakes often occur. The AAO-HNSF guideline explicitly recommends canalith repositioning and recommends against routine suppressants, and a recent meta-analysis in BPPV shows no meaningful benefit of vestibular suppressants on symptom resolution at follow-up compared with placebo or no treatment, whereas canalith repositioning clearly outperforms suppressants, so chronic or even routine short courses here are guideline-discordant and can delay central compensation [^1119ZDtn] [^116vfEaJ] [^116QTGJX].

> For vestibular neuritis, I should confirm the time window and balance benefits and risks. The GRACE-3 emergency medicine guidance supports shared decision-making regarding corticosteroids within 72 hours of onset, given mixed evidence; vestibular suppressants should be used only briefly, typically no more than 48 to 72 hours, to avoid hindering compensation; prompt vestibular rehabilitation accelerates recovery of gaze and postural stability, so I need to stress early mobilization and targeted therapy rather than prolonged symptomatic drugs [^113gwVdV] [^11166QYo].

> Now, Ménière's disease — wait, I almost said "betahistine reduces attacks", but I should double-check the certainty. The 2020 AAO-HNSF Ménière's guideline allows a limited course of vestibular suppressants for acute vertigo attacks, yet Cochrane reviews indicate that the long-term efficacy of systemic pharmacologic therapies such as betahistine and diuretics remains uncertain due to low-certainty evidence; therefore, patients should be counseled about the limited evidence base, individualized trialing of therapies, and the importance of nonpharmacologic measures and hearing care while reserving suppressants strictly for severe, acute episodes [^113nn1Ln] [^116nXy64] [^1139pRce] [^113tQafn].

> For vestibular migraine, I should confirm both acute and preventive strategies and the certainty of evidence. The acute treatment paradigm mirrors migraine care with agents such as triptans and NSAIDs, and antiemetics for nausea, but high-quality systematic reviews find few and small trials with low to very low certainty, and even for triptans results remain inconclusive; for prevention, diverse classes are used pragmatically, yet prophylaxis evidence is similarly low-certainty, so I must emphasize individualized selection, slow titration, comorbidity alignment, and avoidance of chronic vestibular suppressants [^114WD9Ms] [^111XjhXC] [^1167gv57] [^1118N2ez] [^1143CGi8] [^111Z5n8e].

> I need to ensure nonpharmacologic therapy is not an afterthought, because it is often the mainstay across etiologies other than BPPV maneuvers. Targeted, supervised vestibular rehabilitation improves symptoms and function in unilateral and bilateral peripheral hypofunction across acute, subacute, and chronic phases, with scalable options including digital and supported home programs; dosing should be tailored to deficits and progressed to drive adaptation, with cessation when goals are reached or a plateau occurs [^11166QYo] [^114LEAy6] [^112vHZqU] [^113vP8aK].

> Older adults require special caution, and I should double-check the magnitude of harm. The Beers-aligned concern is supported by large claims analyses showing that vestibular suppressant prescriptions after dizziness diagnoses are associated with substantially increased hazards of injurious falls, so in those over 65 I should preferentially avoid suppressants, prioritize etiologic treatment and rehabilitation, and use the lowest effective doses for the shortest possible time only if absolutely necessary [^113r4nZ9] [^115WCNzR].

> Duration and safety monitoring deserve explicit guardrails, and I should verify consistency with guidelines. For non-BPPV acute vertigo, if vestibular suppressants are used, employ the minimum effective dose for hours to a few days, avoid benzodiazepines where possible due to dependence and falls, reserve antiemetics for significant nausea, and reassess promptly to transition off suppressants to allow central compensation and engage rehabilitation, while in BPPV avoid suppressants entirely and proceed with repositioning and follow-up reassessment within about one month per guideline algorithms [^116RAx4B] [^1119ZDtn] [^111Ar3eC].

> Synthesizing all of this, I should conclude clearly yet cautiously: medications for vertigo are adjuncts tailored to etiology — no routine suppressants in BPPV where canalith repositioning is definitive; consider a brief, time-limited suppressant course for severe Ménière's attacks while acknowledging uncertain long-term benefits of agents like betahistine and diuretics; in vestibular neuritis, weigh early corticosteroids through shared decision-making and limit suppressants to 48–72 hours; in vestibular migraine, use standard migraine-directed acute and preventive therapies recognizing the low-certainty evidence and avoid chronic suppressants; across conditions, emphasize early vestibular rehabilitation and heightened fall-risk mitigation, especially in older adults [^116QTGJX] [^116vfEaJ] [^113nn1Ln] [^116nXy64] [^113gwVdV] [^114WD9Ms] [^11166QYo] [^113r4nZ9].

Vertigo treatment is **diagnosis-specific** [^113teZZ9], with BPPV managed with canalith repositioning, not medications [^116QTGJX] [^1119ZDtn]. For acute vertigo, **short-term vestibular suppressants** (meclizine, dimenhydrinate, benzodiazepines) are used briefly for severe symptoms, but not long term due to sedation and fall risk [^116RAx4B] [^113r4nZ9]. Ménière's disease may use betahistine, diuretics, or intratympanic steroids for attack control [^113nn1Ln] [^116nXy64]. Vestibular migraine is treated with triptans for acute attacks and beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, or antiepileptics for prevention [^111XjhXC] [^1118N2ez]. Vestibular suppressants are **not recommended for BPPV or chronic vertigo**, and all medications should be tailored to the cause and patient factors [^116vfEaJ].

## Medications for acute vertigo

Acute vertigo is often managed with vestibular suppressants that depress vestibular function to provide symptomatic relief [^116RAx4B]. These agents are typically **used short-term** because they are sedating and may delay central compensation [^111RQgEF].

| **Medication class** | **Examples** | **Indications** | **Mechanism of action** | **Side effects** |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| Antihistamines | - Meclizine <br/> - Dimenhydrinate <br/> - Promethazine | - Acute vertigo <br/> - Motion sickness | Histamine H1 receptor antagonists; vestibular suppression | - Sedation [^111i59ub] <br/> - Dry mouth <br/> - Drowsiness <br/> - Fall risk |
| Benzodiazepines | - Diazepam <br/> - Lorazepam <br/> - Clonazepam | Severe acute vertigo | GABA-A receptor agonists; CNS depression | - Sedation [^116RAx4B] <br/> - Dependence <br/> - Cognitive impairment <br/> - Fall risk [^113r4nZ9] |
| Antiemetics | - Prochlorperazine <br/> - Metoclopramide | Nausea and vomiting associated with vertigo [^11666Df3] | Dopamine receptor antagonists | - Extrapyramidal symptoms <br/> - Sedation <br/> - Drowsiness |

## Medications for chronic vertigo

Chronic vertigo requires **long-term, cause-specific management** [^1132xzrG]. The following medications are commonly used:

---

### Ménière's disease

- **Betahistine**: Histamine analog that improves microcirculation in the inner ear, reducing frequency and severity of vertigo attacks.
- **Diuretics (e.g. hydrochlorothiazide)**: Reduce endolymphatic fluid pressure, decreasing vertigo episodes.
- **Intratympanic corticosteroids**: Used for refractory cases to reduce inflammation and vertigo frequency [^112Dzatm].

---

### Vestibular migraine

- **Triptans (e.g. sumatriptan)**: Effective for acute attacks.
- **Beta-blockers (e.g. propranolol)**: Preventive therapy to reduce attack frequency [^1118N2ez].
- **Calcium channel blockers (e.g. verapamil)**: Preventive therapy [^114BJqGp].
- **Antiepileptics (e.g. topiramate)**: Preventive therapy [^1143CGi8].

---

## Medications not recommended for vertigo

Certain medications are explicitly **not recommended** for specific vertigo conditions. Vestibular suppressants (antihistamines, benzodiazepines) are not recommended in **BPPV** because they do not address the underlying cause and may delay recovery [^1119ZDtn] [^116vfEaJ]. In **chronic vertigo**, long-term use of vestibular suppressants is discouraged due to sedation, cognitive impairment, and increased fall risk [^113r4nZ9] [^111i59ub].

---

## Special considerations for elderly patients

Elderly patients require careful consideration due to **increased susceptibility to side effects**:

- **Increased fall risk**: Sedative medications significantly increase fall risk in elderly patients [^111i59ub] [^113r4nZ9].
- **Cognitive impairment**: Benzodiazepines and antihistamines can cause significant cognitive impairment [^116RAx4B].
- **Alternative therapies**: Vestibular rehabilitation and non-sedating medications are preferred [^11166QYo].

---

## Emerging pharmacological treatments

Recent research has explored **new pharmacological treatments**, including **aminopyridines**, which may restore normal pacemaker activity in cerebellar nuclei for certain vestibular disorders [^111TBqZ1]; **botulinum toxin** has also been investigated for vestibular migraine, though evidence is limited [^114BJqGp] [^113q8Z72].

## Summary of medications for vertigo

| **Condition** | **Recommended medications** | **Not recommended medications** |
|-|-|-|
| BPPV | - Canalith repositioning maneuvers [^116QTGJX] | Vestibular suppressants [^1119ZDtn] |
| Ménière's disease | - Betahistine <br/> - Diuretics <br/> - Intratympanic corticosteroids | Long-term vestibular suppressants |
| Vestibular migraine | - Triptans <br/> - Beta-blockers <br/> - Calcium channel blockers <br/> - Antiepileptics [^1118N2ez] | Long-term vestibular suppressants [^116RAx4B] |
| Acute vertigo | - Antihistamines <br/> - Benzodiazepines <br/> - Antiemetics (short-term) [^116RAx4B] | Long-term use of vestibular suppressants [^113r4nZ9] |

---

Medications for vertigo should be tailored to the underlying cause, with acute vertigo managed by short-term vestibular suppressants [^116RAx4B] and chronic vertigo managed by condition-specific medications. Long-term use of **vestibular suppressants** is discouraged due to side effects and fall risk, especially in elderly patients [^113r4nZ9] [^111i59ub].

### Vestibular suppressant utilization and subsequent falls among patients 65 years and older with dizziness in the United States [^113r4nZ9]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2025). High credibility.

Falls pose a significant public health threat to older adults. Due to potential fall risks, guidelines recommend against the routine prescription of several medications commonly used for vestibular suppression, including meclizine and benzodiazepines.

- **Aims**: We aimed to determine the factors associated with vestibular suppressant utilization among patients with dizziness aged 65 years and older, and subsequent falls.

- **Methods and results**: A retrospective longitudinal database of US commercial insurance and Medicare beneficiaries was used to study medical claims data from January 1, 2006, through December 31, 2015. Of 190,348 individuals aged 65 years and older who presented with dizziness, 60,658 (32%) filled a vestibular suppressant prescription (27% anti-emetics, 73% anxiolytics), of which 20,448 were women (34%) within a month after their dizziness diagnosis. Of those individuals using suppressants, 8% experienced a fall resulting in a medical encounter within 60 days of filling the prescription. After adjusting for sociodemographics and comorbidity, individuals with dizziness who received vestibular suppressants were more likely to experience recorded fall incidents (hazard ratio (HR) 3.33, confidence interval (CI) 1.93–5.72, p < 0.0001) than those who did not receive vestibular suppressants.

- **Conclusions**: Although vestibular suppressants may provide immediate relief from symptoms during an acute vestibular crisis, their use is incongruent with guideline-concordant care for most vestibular diagnoses and is also potentially counterproductive and injurious. Multi-faceted interventions are recommended to…

### Efficacy of benzodiazepines or antihistamines for patients with acute vertigo: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^116RAx4B]. JAMA Neurology (2022). High credibility.

Acute vertigo can be disabling. Antihistamines and benzodiazepines are frequently prescribed as "vestibular suppressants", but their efficacy is unclear. This study aims to assess the efficacy of antihistamines and benzodiazepines in treating acute vertigo from any underlying cause.

A comprehensive search was conducted in the PubMed, CENTRAL, EMBASE, CINAHL, Scopus, and ClinicalTrials.gov databases from inception until January 14, 2019, without language restrictions. Additionally, bibliographies of included studies and relevant reviews were screened.

- **Study selection**: Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) were included, comparing antihistamine or benzodiazepine use with another comparator, placebo, or no intervention for patients experiencing acute vertigo for 2 weeks or less. Studies involving healthy volunteers, prophylactic treatment, or induced vertigo were excluded, as were studies comparing two medications from the same class.

- **Data extraction and synthesis**: Data were extracted and the risk of bias was assessed by two authors independently for each study, following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The data were pooled using a random-effects model.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: The predefined primary outcome was the change in 10- or 100-point vertigo or dizziness visual analog scale (VAS) scores at 2 hours after treatment. Secondary outcomes included change in nausea VAS scores at 2 hours, use of rescue medication at 2 hours, and improvement or resolution of vertigo at 1 week or 1 month.

Of the 27 trials identified, the systematic review and meta-analysis provide a detailed assessment of available evidence for clinicians considering vestibular suppressants for acute vertigo management.

### Vestibular migraine treatment: a comprehensive practical review [^114BJqGp]. Brain (2022). Low credibility.

The evidence from studies included in this review is of almost universally low quality, making interpretation complex; however, this does not necessarily imply a lack of treatment effect. Treatment recommendations summarize the available evidence both in terms of efficacy and side-effect profile. It seems prudent to highlight that, as for any condition, one should not treat 'vestibular migraine' but rather the patient. An individualized approach may be necessary, considering clinical and demographic features as well as psychological variables that commonly coexist in this (and any other) chronic disorder. The sometimes violent and almost always disconcerting and incapacitating loss of control associated with unpredictable vertiginous attacks renders this latter point of particular importance. An individualized treatment approach that utilizes available evidence to fit the particular person can maximize patient acceptance of treatment and the chance of a positive response.

- **Treatment options for management of vestibular migraine based on efficacy and side-effect profile data**:

	- **All patients**:
		Abortive treatment — use less than 10 days per month
		Simple analgesics/NSAIDs/triptans for headache
		Vestibular sedatives (cyclizine, prochlorperazine, cinnarizine) for vertigo
		Consider prochlorperazine, cyclizine, cinnarizine, or domperidone for nausea

	- **Preventative treatment**:
		Best efficacy evidence and lower rates of serio

### Pharmacological interventions for acute attacks of vestibular migraine [^114WD9Ms]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). High credibility.

Vestibular migraine is a form of migraine where one of the main features is recurrent attacks of vertigo. These episodes are often associated with other features of migraine, including headache and sensitivity to light or sound. The unpredictable and severe attacks of vertigo can lead to a considerable reduction in quality of life. The condition is estimated to affect just under 1% of the population, although many people remain undiagnosed. A number of pharmacological interventions have been used or proposed to be used at the time of a vestibular migraine attack to help reduce the severity or resolve the symptoms. These are predominantly based on treatments that are in use for headache migraine, with the belief that the underlying pathophysiology of these conditions is similar.

- **Objectives**: To assess the benefits and harms of pharmacological interventions used to relieve acute attacks of vestibular migraine.

- **Search methods**: The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP, and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 23 September 2022.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs in adults with definite or probable vestibular migraine, comparing triptans, ergot alkaloids, dopamine antagonists, antihistamines, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, gepants (CGRP receptor antagonists), magnesium, paracetamol, or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.

### Clinical practice guideline: Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (update) [^114FPKMQ]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for dizziness and vertigo, specifically in relation to the Dix-Hallpike maneuver, the AAO-HNSF 2017 guidelines recommend performing the Dix-Hallpike maneuver. This involves bringing the patient from an upright to a supine position with the head turned 45 degrees to one side and the neck extended 20 degrees, with the affected ear facing down. This procedure aims to elicit provoked vertigo associated with torsional, upbeating nystagmus for diagnosing posterior semicircular canal benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. If the initial maneuver is negative, repeat the maneuver with the opposite ear facing down.

### Pharmacological interventions for acute attacks of vestibular migraine [^116PFmJJ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). High credibility.

Balance disorders can be difficult to diagnose and treat. There are few specific diagnostic tests, a variety of related disorders, and a limited number of interventions known to be effective. To determine which topics within this area should be addressed with new or updated systematic reviews, we conducted a scoping and prioritization process involving stakeholders. Vestibular migraine was ranked as one of the highest priority topics during this process, along with persistent postural‐perceptual dizziness and Ménière's disease.

The impact of vestibular migraine is considerable, with 40% of sufferers reporting sickness from work and over 70% reporting the impact of their symptoms on daily activities as either moderate or severe. At present, there are no national or international guidelines to inform the management of this condition. Therefore, up-to-date, reliable evidence syntheses are required to help patients and healthcare professionals determine the benefits and harms of different interventions used for the condition.

### Clinical practice guideline: Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (update) executive summary [^115fLLun]. Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

The American Academy of Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery Foundation has published a supplement to this issue of Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery featuring the "Clinical Practice Guideline: Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (Update)". To assist in implementing the guideline recommendations, this article summarizes the rationale, purpose, and key action statements.

The 14 recommendations developed emphasize:

- **Diagnostic accuracy and efficiency**: Focus on improving the precision of diagnostic processes.
- **Reducing inappropriate use of vestibular suppressant medications**: Aim to decrease reliance on unnecessary medications.
- **Decreasing inappropriate use of ancillary testing**: Encourage reduction of unwarranted tests.
- **Increasing appropriate therapeutic repositioning maneuvers**: Promote the use of correct clinical maneuvers for treatment.

An updated guideline is needed due to new clinical trials, new systematic reviews, and the lack of consumer participation in the initial guideline development group.

### Vestibular migraine treatment: a comprehensive practical review [^112mMVLH]. Brain (2022). Low credibility.

Vestibular migraine is an underdiagnosed but increasingly recognized neurological condition that causes episodic vertigo associated with other features of migraine. It is now thought to be the most common cause of spontaneous (non-positional) episodic vertigo, affecting up to 1% of the population. A meta-analysis of preventative treatments for vestibular migraine was published in 2021, but the authors were unable to establish a preferred treatment strategy due to low quality of evidence and heterogeneity of study design and outcome reporting. Therefore, there remains a clinical need for pragmatic management guidelines specific to vestibular migraine using the available evidence.

Here, we provide a practical review utilizing a systematic qualitative assessment of the evidence for abortive and preventative interventions in adults. The overall evidence base for vestibular migraine treatment is of low quality. Nevertheless, we provide practical treatment recommendations based on the available evidence and our experience to help guide clinicians treating patients with vestibular migraine. We also discuss how future clinical trials could be designed to improve the quality of evidence in this condition.

### Internet-based vestibular rehabilitation with and without physiotherapy support for adults aged 50 and older with a chronic vestibular syndrome in general practice: three-armed randomised controlled trial [^113vP8aK]. BMJ (2019). High credibility.

Vestibular symptoms, such as vertigo and dizziness, are common in general practice. Each year, 5% of the general population experiences vertigo symptoms. The prevalence, frequency, and severity of vertigo generally increase with age. Four out of five people with vertigo report that it severely affects their daily functioning. Vertigo also represents a substantial economic burden due to absenteeism, high use of healthcare services, and an increased risk of falling. More than 80% of patients experiencing vertigo in the Netherlands, United Kingdom, and United States are primarily treated by their general practitioner or primary care doctor and are never referred to a medical specialist for their symptoms.

In the International Classification of Vestibular Disorders, developed by the leading international Bárány Society for neuro-otology, four types of vestibular symptoms are identified: vertigo, dizziness, vestibulovisual symptoms, and postural symptoms. No vestibular symptom is considered pathognomonic in its links to underlying vestibular disease, and the same patient often experiences more than one vestibular symptom. Peripheral vestibular dysfunction due to disorders such as benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, vestibular neuritis, vestibular migraine, or Meniere's disease is the most important cause of vestibular symptoms. Each peripheral vestibular disorder has a distinct initial treatment, and they all have a substantial potential to result in chronic vestibular symptoms. When a vestibular disorder damages the peripheral vestibular system, an innate repair mechanism may occur, though it was not fully covered in this text.

### VA/DoD clinical practice guideline for the management of concussion-mild traumatic brain injury [^112mqjze]. VA/DoD (2016). High credibility.

For patients exhibiting post-concussion vestibular dysfunction and acute mTBI, the DoD/VA 2016 guidelines suggest considering a short-term trial of specific vestibular, visual, and proprioceptive therapeutic exercises. This is to assess the individual patient's responsiveness to treatment, particularly in those with a history of mTBI presenting with functional impairments such as dizziness, disequilibrium, and spatial disorientation symptoms. It is advisable to avoid offering a prolonged course of therapy if there is no observable improvement in the patient.

### Dizziness: Approach to evaluation and management [^113teZZ9]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Dizziness is a common yet imprecise symptom. It was traditionally divided into four categories based on the patient's history: vertigo, presyncope, disequilibrium, and light-headedness. However, the distinction between these symptoms is of limited clinical usefulness. Patients have difficulty describing the quality of their symptoms but can more consistently identify the timing and triggers.

Episodic vertigo triggered by head motion may be due to benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. Vertigo with unilateral hearing loss suggests Meniere disease. Episodic vertigo not associated with any trigger may be a symptom of vestibular neuritis. Evaluation focuses on determining whether the etiology is peripheral or central.

- **Peripheral etiologies**: Usually benign.
- **Central etiologies**: Often require urgent treatment.

The HINTS (head-impulse, nystagmus, test of skew) examination can help distinguish peripheral from central etiologies. The physical examination includes orthostatic blood pressure measurement, a full cardiac and neurologic examination, assessment for nystagmus, and the Dix-Hallpike maneuver. Laboratory testing and imaging are not required and are usually not helpful.

- **Treatment options**:
	- Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo can be treated with a canalith repositioning procedure (e.g. Epley maneuver).
	- Treatment of Meniere disease includes salt restriction and diuretics.
	- Symptoms of vestibular neuritis are relieved with vestibular suppressant medications and vestibular rehabilitation.

### Vestibular assessment: a practical approach [^1141ejLA]. Occupational Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

This paper presents an evidence-based introduction to assessing and managing the dizzy patient. It is based on a literature review highlighting best practices and the clinical experience of the author. Dizziness is common, often chronic, and largely untreated, resulting in significant personal and economic loss. Serious pathological causes of dizziness can be quickly and effectively screened by a simple ocular motor examination, distinguishing these from peripheral vestibular lesions. A triage approach is proposed, differentiating dizziness into either acute onset, intermittent episodes, or continuous symptoms, along with management strategies for the most common causes of dizziness. Vestibular suppressant medication should be restricted to the acute phase of a vestibular episode. Vestibular rehabilitation therapy is the most effective treatment for continuous or chronic dizziness.

### Pharmacological agents for the prevention of vestibular migraine [^115vADeC]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). High credibility.

Vestibular migraine is a common cause of episodic vertigo. Many preventive treatments have been proposed for this condition, including calcium antagonists, beta-blockers, antidepressants, anticonvulsants, selective 5-HT1 agonists, serotonin antagonists, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of pharmacological agents for the prevention of vestibular migraine.

- **Search methods**: The Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group (CENTDG) Trials Search Co-ordinator searched the CENTDG Trials Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2015, Issue 5); PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was June 5, 2015.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in adults (over 18 years) with a diagnosis of vestibular migraine or probable vestibular migraine according to the Bárány Society/International Headache Society (IHS) criteria, treated in any setting, comparing pharmacological treatments used in the prevention of vestibular migraine, including beta-blockers, calcium antagonists, anticonvulsants, antidepressants, serotonin antagonists, and NSAIDs against placebo or no treatment.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We used the standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration.

- **Main results**: Our literature search identified 558 reports; however, only 11 were sufficiently relevant for further assessment. We excluded two studies because they… (content may continue).

### Systemic pharmacological interventions for Ménière's disease [^116nXy64]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). High credibility.

Ménière's disease is a condition characterized by episodes of vertigo, hearing loss, and tinnitus. Various pharmacological treatments, such as betahistine, diuretics, antiviral medications, and corticosteroids, have been utilized in managing this condition. However, the underlying cause of Ménière's disease and the mechanisms by which these treatments may work remain unknown. The efficacy of these interventions in preventing vertigo attacks and associated symptoms is unclear.

The objective of this review is to evaluate the benefits and harms of systemic pharmacological interventions versus placebo or no treatment in individuals with Ménière's disease.

- **Search methods**: The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist conducted a search in multiple databases, including the Cochrane ENT Register, Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov, ICTRP, and additional sources, for both published and unpublished trials as of 14 September 2022.

- **Selection criteria**: The review included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs in adults with definite or probable Ménière's disease, comparing treatments such as betahistine, diuretics, antihistamines, antivirals, or systemic corticosteroids against placebo or no treatment. Studies with a follow-up period of less than three months, or those with a cross-over design (unless data from the first phase of the study could be identified), were excluded.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Standard Cochrane methods were employed. The primary outcomes focused on the improvement in vertigo, assessed as a dichotomous outcome.

### Neurological update: Dizziness [^112Z76aN]. Journal of Neurology (2020). Low credibility.

The diagnosis and management of vertigo remain a challenge for clinicians, including those in general neurology. In recent years, there have been advances in understanding established vestibular syndromes and the development of treatments for existing vestibular diagnoses. This update reviews how our understanding of previously "unexplained" dizziness in the elderly is changing. It explores novel insights into the pathophysiology of vestibular migraine and its relationship to the newly coined term 'persistent postural perceptual dizziness'. Finally, it discusses how a simple bedside oculomotor assessment may help identify vestibular presentations of stroke.

### Clinical practice guideline: Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (update) [^117AP6bq]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). High credibility.

This update of a 2008 guideline from the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation provides evidence-based recommendations for benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), defined as a disorder of the inner ear characterized by repeated episodes of positional vertigo. Changes from the prior guideline include the addition of a consumer advocate to the update group, new evidence from two clinical practice guidelines, 20 systematic reviews, and 27 randomized controlled trials. There is also an enhanced emphasis on patient education and shared decision-making, a new algorithm to clarify action statement relationships, and new and expanded recommendations for the diagnosis and management of BPPV.

The primary purposes of this guideline are to improve the quality of care and outcomes for BPPV by enhancing the accurate and efficient diagnosis of BPPV, reducing the inappropriate use of vestibular suppressant medications, decreasing the inappropriate use of ancillary testing such as radiographic imaging, and increasing the use of appropriate therapeutic repositioning maneuvers.

The guideline is intended for all clinicians who are likely to diagnose and manage patients with BPPV and applies to any setting in which BPPV would be identified, monitored, or managed. The target patient for the guideline is aged ≥ 18 years with a suspected or potential diagnosis of BPPV. The primary outcome considered in this guideline is the resolution of the symptoms associated with BPPV, while secondary outcomes include an increased rate of accurate diagnoses of BPPV and a more efficient management approach.

### Vestibular migraine: A critical review of treatment trials [^1125mSJc]. Journal of Neurology (2009). Low credibility.

Vestibular migraine (VM), also known as migraine-associated vertigo, is a common cause of dizziness in adults. We performed a comprehensive literature search regarding treatment for VM or migraine-associated vertigo during the period of 1990–2008, using, individually or in combination, the search terms VM, migraine-associated vertigo, migraine-associated dizziness, migrainous vertigo, migraine and vertigo, migraine and disequilibrium, and headache and vertigo. We found nine publications that address treatment strategies for VM. One small randomized clinical trial found some benefit from the use of zolmitriptan for abortive treatment of VM. The other eight observational studies showed marginal improvement with migraine prophylactic medications such as nortriptyline, verapamil, or metoprolol. Until more specific treatment options become available, patients with VM need to be managed with similar prophylactic and abortive strategies as those used for migraine in adults.

### Vestibular suppressant utilization and subsequent falls among patients 65 years and older with dizziness in the United States [^115WCNzR]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2025). High credibility.

Both implementation and de-implementation efforts are essential in managing care for patients with dizziness. Implementation efforts include achieving an accurate diagnosis and initiating the correct, etiologically based therapy to address the underlying disease, which is ultimately more patient-centered than managing symptoms with vestibular suppressants. Although the AGS Beer's criteria underscore the risks of vestibular suppression among individuals over age 65, other interventions may also be effective. Since we observed that vestibular suppressants are associated with fall risk for individuals with dizziness, de-implementation efforts are also warranted. De-implementation focuses on reducing low-value care, especially treatments that are harmful or lack evidence of effectiveness.

De-implementation strategies may be most effective when employing multi-component interventions that engage both clinicians and patients in reducing overuse. Clinicians may benefit from education, feedback, and clinical decision support. For instance, disseminating diagnosis-based clinical practice guidelines, such as those for BPPV, has been shown to reduce inappropriate prescribing. Following the 2008 BPPV guideline publication, research by Dunlap et al. noted a drop in antivertigo or anti-emetic prescriptions during adult ambulatory visits from 50% in 2007–2009 to 16% in 2013–2015. However, many patients initially presenting with dizziness receive non-specific diagnoses, and no guideline exists for managing acute vertigo, which leaves clinicians without a clear course of action.

### Ondansetron or promethazine: Which one is better for the treatment of acute peripheral vertigo [^11666Df3]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2018). Low credibility.

Vertigo is a common and annoying complaint requiring emergent treatment. There are various treatment options for this condition, each with different outcomes and side effects.

- **Objectives**: Assessment and comparison of the effectiveness of ondansetron and promethazine in the treatment of acute peripheral vertigo.

- **Materials and methods**: This clinical trial was conducted in an academic hospital in the north of Iran in 2017. A total of 170 eligible patients were randomly allocated into two groups. Group A received intramuscular (IM) promethazine, and group B received intravenous (IV) ondansetron, using quadripartite blocks. The severity of vertigo, nausea, blood pressure, heart rate, side effects, the need for re-administration, and the time to become asymptomatic were assessed before the injections, 30 minutes after, and 2 hours after the injections.

- **Results**: Excellent improvement in vertigo occurred in both groups (P < 0.05). Heart rates were reduced in both groups, but the changes were insignificant (P > 0.05). The ondansetron-treated group showed a greater need for re-administration of the medication (50.6% vs. 27.1%). The relief score was significantly higher in the ondansetron-treated group compared with the group that received promethazine.

### Systemic pharmacological interventions for Ménière's disease [^1139pRce]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). High credibility.

Ménière's disease is a condition that causes recurring episodes of vertigo, which are associated with hearing loss and tinnitus. Various pharmacological interventions have been utilized in managing this condition, including betahistine, diuretics, antiviral medications, and corticosteroids. The exact cause of Ménière's disease remains unknown, as does the mechanism by which these treatments may work. The efficacy of these interventions in preventing vertigo attacks and their associated symptoms is currently unclear.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the benefits and harms of systemic pharmacological interventions versus placebo or no treatment in people with Ménière's disease.

- **Search methods**: The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Register, Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov, ICTRP, and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 14 September 2022.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs in adults with definite or probable Ménière's disease, comparing betahistine, diuretics, antihistamines, antivirals, or systemic corticosteroids with either placebo or no treatment. We excluded studies with follow-up of less than three months or with a crossover design, unless data from the first phase of the study could be identified.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were improvement in vertigo (assessed as a dichotomous outcome - improved or not improved).

### Vestibular migraine treatment: A comprehensive practical review [^113q8Z72]. Brain (2022). Low credibility.

Botulinum toxin seems to be more effective for treating headache symptoms rather than vestibular symptoms in vestibular migraine (VM). No clear benefit for vestibular outcomes was observed when the toxin was administered alongside preventative medication in a non-randomized study. Although a positive effect on vestibular symptoms remains possible, additional research is necessary to confirm this.

### Pharmacological interventions for prophylaxis of vestibular migraine [^111Z5n8e]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Low credibility.

Balance disorders can be difficult to diagnose and treat. There are few specific diagnostic tests, a variety of related disorders, and a limited number of interventions that are known to be effective. To determine which topics within this area should be addressed with new or updated systematic reviews, we conducted a scoping and prioritization process involving stakeholders. Vestibular migraine was ranked as one of the highest priority topics during this process, along with persistent postural-perceptual dizziness and Ménière's disease.

The impact of vestibular migraine is considerable, with 40% of sufferers reporting sickness from work, and over 70% reporting the impact of their symptoms on daily activities as either moderate or severe. At present, there are no national or international guidelines to inform the management of this condition. Therefore, up-to-date, reliable evidence syntheses are required to help patients and healthcare professionals determine the benefits and harms of different interventions used for the condition.

### Pharmacological interventions for prophylaxis of vestibular migraine [^1143CGi8]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Low credibility.

We assessed all the evidence in this review as either low or very low certainty, using the GRADE approach. This indicates that our confidence in the estimates of effect is low and that additional data from future studies are likely to change these estimates.

Imprecision in the effect estimates was a major contributor to the low certainty of the evidence. The studies included in this review were all relatively small, ranging from 27 to 130 participants, and often the confidence intervals for any effect were wide, sometimes spanning from a beneficial effect to a harmful effect from the intervention.

We had concerns over the risk of bias for the studies included in the review. The studies conducted by Lepcha in 2014 and Yuan in 2016 were open-label, meaning participants and study personnel were aware of the treatment allocation, leading to a high risk of performance bias and detection bias. There were also additional concerns in other domains for both of these studies. We considered the largest study, Bayer 2019, at low risk of bias for most domains. However, due to considerable dropout during the trial, we assessed it at high risk of attrition bias. Additionally, we had concerns over the possibility of selective reporting bias, as outcomes were not reported at the intended final follow-up point.

As described above, we also had concerns over the methods used to assess some outcomes. The certainty of the evidence was reduced for indirectness if the outcome had been assessed using an unvalidated scale, or if the outcome reported did not align with the intended assessment.

### Pharmacological interventions for acute attacks of vestibular migraine [^116oiaRr]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). High credibility.

At least two review authors independently extracted outcome data from each study using a standardized data collection form. Any discrepancies in the data extracted by the two authors were checked against the original reports. Differences were resolved through discussion and consensus, with recourse to a third author where necessary.

We included key characteristics of the studies, including the following information:

- **Study design**: Duration, number of study centers and location, study setting, and dates of the study.
- **Information on participants**: Number randomized, participants lost to follow-up or withdrawn, the number analyzed, participants' age, gender, features of the condition (e.g. probable or definite vestibular migraine), diagnostic criteria used, inclusion and exclusion criteria for the individual studies.
- **Details of the intervention**: Comparator, concomitant treatments, or excluded medications.
- **Outcomes specified and reported by the study authors**: Including the time points for these outcomes.
- **Funding for the study and conflicts of interest**: Any such information provided by the study authors.
- **Information required to assess the risk of bias**: This also includes information to enable GRADE assessment of the evidence.

Once the extracted data were checked and any discrepancies were resolved, a single author transferred the information to Review Manager 5 (RevMan 2020).

The primary effect of interest for this review was the effect of treatment assignment, reflecting outcomes for those assigned to the intervention.

### Pharmacotherapy of vestibular and ocular motor disorders, including nystagmus [^116616L6]. Journal of Neurology (2011). Low credibility.

We review pharmacological treatments for peripheral and central vestibular disorders and ocular motor disorders that impair vision, especially pathological nystagmus. The prerequisites for successful pharmacotherapy of vertigo, dizziness, and abnormal eye movements are the "4 D's": correct diagnosis, correct drug, appropriate dosage, and sufficient duration.

There are seven groups of drugs (the "7 A's") that can be used: antiemetics; anti-inflammatory, anti-Ménière's, and anti-migrainous medications; anti-depressants, anti-convulsants, and aminopyridines. Recovery from acute vestibular neuritis can be promoted by treatment with oral corticosteroids. Betahistine may reduce the frequency of attacks of Ménière's disease. The aminopyridines constitute a novel treatment approach for downbeat and upbeat nystagmus, as well as episodic ataxia type 2 (EA 2); these drugs may restore normal "pacemaker" activity to the Purkinje cells that govern vestibular and cerebellar nuclei.

A limited number of trials indicate that baclofen improves periodic alternating nystagmus, and that gabapentin and memantine improve acquired pendular and infantile (congenital) nystagmus. Preliminary reports suggest the suppression of square-wave saccadic intrusions by memantine, and ocular flutter by beta-blockers. Thus, although progress has been made in the treatment of vestibular neuritis, some forms of pathological nystagmus, and EA 2, controlled, masked trials are still needed to evaluate treatments for many vestibular and ocular motor disorders, including betahistine for Ménière's disease.

### Antidepressants and dizziness [^1126mbMY]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2006). Low credibility.

Despite several pieces of evidence supporting a close relationship between dizziness and anxiety symptoms, the role of antidepressants in the treatment of such conditions remains poorly explored. The high prevalence of dizziness during serotonin reuptake inhibitors discontinuation syndrome and the few reports suggesting the efficacy of antidepressants in treating some vestibular disorders justify careful investigation. Neurophysiologic studies suggest possible focuses of investigation on the mechanisms of drug action. Psychophysiologic studies also suggest a possible role of antidepressant drugs in improving balance control and cognitive functioning. Controlled studies involving antidepressants with selective action in different neurotransmitter systems are necessary to elucidate the complex pathophysiologic mechanisms involving emotional and balance control. For future research, special attention must be paid to the methodology of balance evaluation and the interaction between posture control and cognitive functioning.

### Migraine-associated dizziness: Patient characteristics and management options [^116icNQv]. Otology & Neurotology (2002). Low credibility.

To determine patient characteristics and the effectiveness of therapy for migraine-associated dizziness, a retrospective chart review was conducted at a tertiary referral center. Patients were identified through a code query of billing records for a diagnosis of migraine-associated vertigo or disequilibrium, based on the International Headache Society criteria.

There were 81 patients (61 women, 20 men) with an average age of 36.6 years (range, 8–71 years). All except four patients were evaluated between 1995 and 1999. Follow-up data were obtained from chart reviews, with a mean follow-up time of 54.5 weeks (range, 4 to 456 weeks).

- **Intervention**: One or more treatment methods, including dietary manipulation, medication (tricyclic antidepressants, beta-blockers, or calcium-channel blockers), and neurology consultation, were applied sequentially as necessary.

- **Main outcome measure**: Response to therapy was defined as greater than a 75% reduction in symptom recurrence rate.

Overall, 72% of patients experienced resolution or a dramatic reduction of their attacks of vertigo or disequilibrium. Of the 13 patients treated with the introduction of dietary manipulation alone, 100% received significant relief. Among the 31 patients treated with dietary manipulation and the addition of medication, 77% experienced significant relief. In the final group of 37 patients treated with another medication or a neurology consultation, 57% received substantial relief. Of the responders, the majority (> 95%) experienced an equal reduction in both vertigo and disequilibrium symptoms.

### Systemic pharmacological interventions for Ménière's disease [^117Mzj1b]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Low credibility.

It is important to review balance disorders because they can be difficult to diagnose and treat. There are few specific diagnostic tests, a variety of related disorders with similar symptoms, and a limited number of interventions known to be effective. To determine which topics within this area should be addressed with new or updated systematic reviews, we conducted a scoping and prioritization process involving stakeholders. Ménière's disease was ranked as one of the highest priority topics during this process, along with vestibular migraine and persistent postural perceptual dizziness.

Although Ménière's disease is relatively uncommon, its significant impact on quality of life highlights the importance of identifying effective interventions to alleviate symptoms. There is considerable variation in the management of Ménière's disease on both a national and international scale, with a lack of consensus about appropriate first-line and subsequent therapies.

This review is part of a suite of six that consider different interventions for Ménière's disease. Through these reviews, we hope to provide a thorough summary of the efficacy (benefits and harms) of the different treatment options to support people with Ménière's disease and healthcare professionals in making decisions about their care.

### Non-pharmacological interventions for prophylaxis of vestibular migraine [^113wDvdM]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). High credibility.

Vestibular migraine is a form of migraine where one of the main features is recurrent attacks of vertigo. These episodes are often associated with other features of migraine, including headache and sensitivity to light or sound. These unpredictable and severe attacks of vertigo can lead to a considerable reduction in quality of life. The condition is estimated to affect just under 1% of the population, although many people remain undiagnosed. A number of interventions have been used or proposed as prophylaxis for this condition, to help reduce the frequency of attacks. Many of these interventions include dietary, lifestyle, or behavioral changes, rather than medication.

- **Objectives**: To assess the benefits and harms of non-pharmacological treatments used for prophylaxis of vestibular migraine.

- **Search methods**: The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Register, Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov, ICTRP, and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 23 September 2022.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs in adults with definite or probable vestibular migraine, comparing dietary modifications, sleep improvement techniques, vitamin and mineral supplements, herbal supplements, talking therapies, mind-body interventions, or vestibular rehabilitation with either placebo or no treatment. We excluded studies with a cross-over design unless data from the first phase was available.

### Pharmacological interventions for acute attacks of vestibular migraine [^111XjhXC]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). High credibility.

Vestibular migraine is a form of migraine characterized by recurrent attacks of vertigo. These episodes are often associated with other migraine symptoms, including headache and sensitivity to light or sound. The unpredictable and severe attacks of vertigo can significantly reduce quality of life. The condition is estimated to affect just under 1% of the population, although many people remain undiagnosed. Various pharmacological interventions have been used, or proposed for use, during a vestibular migraine attack to help reduce severity or resolve symptoms. These treatments are predominantly based on those used for headache migraines, under the belief that the underlying pathophysiology of these conditions is similar.

The objective of this study is to assess the benefits and harms of pharmacological interventions used to relieve acute attacks of vestibular migraine.

The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist conducted a comprehensive search in several databases, including the Cochrane ENT Register, CENTRAL, Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov, ICTRP, and additional sources for both published and unpublished trials. The search was conducted on 23 September 2022.

The selection criteria included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs in adults with definite or probable vestibular migraine. These trials compared various pharmacological treatments such as triptans, ergot alkaloids, dopamine antagonists, antihistamines, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, gepants (CGRP receptor antagonists), magnesium, paracetamol, or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).

### Pharmacological interventions for acute attacks of vestibular migraine [^1167gv57]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). High credibility.

We did not identify any randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing interventions (as listed in Types of Interventions) to either placebo or no treatment; therefore, we lack information on the efficacy or harms of other medications used to treat acute attacks of vestibular migraine.

Both studies used the same method to assess symptom improvement. The change in a four-point scale of symptom severity was converted to a dichotomous outcome, where "improvement" meant a change from severity levels of 3 or 2 down to 0 or 1. We could not find information on whether this scale has been validated for use in this context. It is noted that some individuals may regard a change in symptoms from 'severe' to 'moderate' as improvement. Further research is needed to identify the best ways to measure symptoms of vestibular migraine and assess what changes in symptoms are meaningful and important to people with this condition.

For the outcome of 'improvement in vertigo', individuals with 'mild' attacks of vestibular migraine were not included. Only attacks classified as moderate or severe were assessed for improvement. Additionally, one of the included studies allowed participants to treat up to three attacks of vestibular migraine with the same medication (NCT02447991). Consequently, people who experienced more frequent attacks of vestibular migraine contributed more outcome data to the analysis than those who experienced only one attack over the course of the trial. The overall effect of these study features suggests that the outcome data may be skewed towards the effectiveness of the interventions.

### Vertigo and motion sickness. Part II: Pharmacologic treatment [^111RQgEF]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2006). Low credibility.

Vertigo is a sensation of movement when no actual movement is occurring. It is often accompanied by visceral autonomic symptoms, including pallor, diaphoresis, nausea, and vomiting. Vertigo is similar to motion sickness in that both may be caused by vestibular stimulation that does not match an internal model of expected environmental stimuli. A functioning vestibular system is necessary for the perception of motion sickness; for this reason, many of the same drugs are used to treat both conditions.

The investigation of drugs that treat motion sickness is helpful in discovering medications that may treat vertigo caused by diseases of the vestibular system. In this article, the pharmacologic agents available for the treatment of vertigo are discussed, along with those agents that are still under study.

The LCG 2017 guidelines address specific circumstances related to dizziness and vertigo, with a particular focus on patients experiencing post-concussion vestibular dysfunction and acute mTBI. These guidelines recommend performing a canalith repositioning maneuver in patients with benign positional vertigo if the Dix-Hallpike maneuver is positive. For both subjective and objective benign positional vertigo, the Epley maneuver should be performed in patients with a positive Dix-Hallpike maneuver. In other cases, it is advised to refer the patient to an otolaryngologist or a healthcare professional certified in vestibular therapy.

### Systemic pharmacological interventions for Ménière's disease [^113tQafn]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). High credibility.

- **Primary outcomes**: Improvement in vertigo measured as a dichotomous outcome (improved/not improved), according to self‐report, or according to a change of a specified score (as described by the study authors) on a vertigo rating scale.

- **Change in vertigo**: Measured as a continuous outcome, to identify the extent of change in vertigo symptoms.

- **Serious adverse events**: Including any event that causes death, is life‐threatening, requires hospitalization, results in disability or permanent damage, or in congenital abnormality. Measured as the number of participants who experienced at least one serious adverse event during the follow‐up period.

Vertigo symptoms comprise a variety of different features, including the frequency of episodes, duration of episodes, and severity/intensity of the episodes. Where possible, we included data for vertigo outcomes that encompassed all of these three aspects (frequency, duration, and severity/intensity of symptoms). However, we anticipated that these data may not be available from all studies; therefore, we extracted data on the frequency of vertigo episodes as an alternative measure for these outcomes.

Ménière's disease (MD) is a clinical condition defined by spontaneous vertigo attacks, each lasting between 20 minutes to 12 hours, with documented low- to mid-frequency sensorineural hearing loss in the affected ear before, during, or after one of the episodes of vertigo. It also presents with fluctuating aural symptoms, such as hearing loss, tinnitus, or ear fullness, in the affected ear. Although the underlying etiology of MD is not completely clear, it has been associated with increases in inner ear fluid volume, ultimately resulting in episodic ear symptoms like vertigo, fluctuating hearing loss, tinnitus, and aural fullness. Physical examination findings are often unremarkable, and audiometric testing may or may not show low- to mid-frequency sensorineural hearing loss. Imaging, if performed, is typically normal.

The goals of MD treatment are to prevent or reduce vertigo severity and frequency, relieve or prevent hearing loss, tinnitus, and aural fullness, and improve quality of life. Treatment approaches to MD are varied and typically include modifications of lifestyle factors, such as diet, as well as medical, surgical, or combination therapies.

The primary purpose of this clinical practice guideline is to improve the quality of the diagnostic workup and treatment outcomes of MD. To achieve this purpose, the goals of this guideline are to use the best available published scientific and/or clinical evidence to enhance diagnostic accuracy and appropriate therapeutic interventions, both medical and surgical, while reducing unindicated diagnostic testing and/or imaging.

### Best practice assessment and management of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo in older adults [^116zyYkQ]. Age and Ageing (2025). Low credibility.

- **Other barriers: Complications**: Nausea, vomiting, and a sense of imbalance are common side effects, which occur in 13.8% of patients post-BPPV treatment and can last up to 24 hours. Canal conversion, which involves moving otoconia typically from the posterior into the horizontal canal, occurs in 6% of cases. These patients experience additional symptoms and require further maneuvers. An otolithic (or postural) crisis is a sudden and severe sensation of imbalance at the end of a repositioning maneuver. It occurs in up to 10% of maneuvers to treat posterior canal BPPV, resulting from the otoconia passing from the canal into the utricle. Despite these issues, 95% of patients report that they would elect to have treatment again if BPPV recurred.

- **Solution**: Discuss the patient's concerns, informing them of the short-lived side effects, the risks of declining treatment, and the benefits of accepting treatment, as well as any plans to manage side effects should they occur. Consider rescheduling the appointment if the patient would prefer to have someone with them for reassurance. If possible, consider treatment in their home if they prefer. If there is anxiety around nausea and vomiting, an anti-emetic can be administered before the maneuver. Provide reassurance that there is time to rest and lie still after the treatment. Familiarize the patient with the movements involved by demonstration. Often, patients have assumptions about the test being physically taxing or risky; understanding the condition can help address their fears. To prevent falls during an otolithic crisis, the clinician(s) should support the patient.

### Pharmacological interventions for prophylaxis of vestibular migraine [^1118N2ez]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). High credibility.

Improvement in vertigo is measured as a dichotomous outcome (improved/not improved), according to self-report, or according to a change of a specified score on a vertigo rating scale, as described by the study authors. Change in vertigo is measured as a continuous outcome to identify the extent of change in vertigo symptoms.

- **Serious adverse events**: Any event that caused death, was life-threatening, required hospitalisation, resulted in disability or permanent damage, or led to congenital abnormality is included. It is measured as the number of participants who experienced at least one serious adverse event during the follow-up period.

Vertigo symptoms comprise a variety of different features, including the frequency of episodes, duration of episodes, and severity/intensity of episodes. Where possible, we included data for the vertigo outcomes that encompassed all of these three aspects (frequency, duration, and severity/intensity of symptoms). However, we anticipated that these data may not be available from all studies. If they were unavailable, then we extracted data on the frequency of vertigo episodes as an alternative measure for these outcomes.

### Pharmacotherapy of vestibular and ocular motor disorders, including nystagmus [^111TBqZ1]. Journal of Neurology (2011). Low credibility.

We review pharmacological treatments for peripheral and central vestibular disorders and ocular motor disorders that impair vision, especially pathological nystagmus. The prerequisites for successful pharmacotherapy of vertigo, dizziness, and abnormal eye movements are the "4 D's": correct diagnosis, correct drug, appropriate dosage, and sufficient duration.

- **The 7 A's of pharmacological treatment**: There are seven groups of drugs that can be used: antiemetics; anti-inflammatory, anti-Ménière's, and anti-migrainous medications; antidepressants, anticonvulsants, and aminopyridines.

A recovery from acute vestibular neuritis can be promoted by treatment with oral corticosteroids. Betahistine may reduce the frequency of attacks of Ménière's disease. The aminopyridines constitute a novel treatment approach for downbeat and upbeat nystagmus, as well as episodic ataxia type 2 (EA 2); these drugs may restore normal "pacemaker" activity to the Purkinje cells that govern vestibular and cerebellar nuclei.

A limited number of trials indicate that baclofen improves periodic alternating nystagmus, and that gabapentin and memantine improve acquired pendular and infantile (congenital) nystagmus. Preliminary reports suggest the suppression of square-wave saccadic intrusions by memantine and ocular flutter by beta-blockers.

Thus, although progress has been made in the treatment of vestibular neuritis, some forms of pathological nystagmus, and EA 2, controlled, masked trials are still needed to evaluate treatments for many vestibular and ocular motor disorders, including betahistine for Ménière's disease.

### Dizziness: Evaluation and management [^1132xzrG]. American Family Physician (2023). Low credibility.

Dizziness is a common but often diagnostically challenging condition. Clinicians should focus on the timing of events and triggers of dizziness to develop a differential diagnosis because it is difficult for patients to provide quality reports of their symptoms. The differential diagnosis is broad and includes both peripheral and central causes. Peripheral etiologies can cause significant morbidity but are generally less concerning, whereas central etiologies are more urgent.

The physical examination may include orthostatic blood pressure measurement, a full cardiac and neurologic examination, assessment for nystagmus, the Dix-Hallpike maneuver (for patients with triggered dizziness), and the HINTS (head-impulse, nystagmus, test of skew) examination when indicated. Laboratory testing and imaging are usually not required but can be helpful.

The treatment for dizziness is dependent on the etiology of the symptoms. Canalith repositioning procedures (e.g. Epley maneuver) are the most useful in treating benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. Vestibular rehabilitation is beneficial in treating many peripheral and central etiologies. Other etiologies of dizziness require specific treatment to address the cause. Pharmacologic intervention is limited because it often affects the ability of the central nervous system to compensate for dizziness.

### Vestibular migraine treatment: A comprehensive practical review [^111ieCyk]. Brain (2022). Low credibility.

Tricyclics and serotonin–noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors

Despite being one of the more commonly used preventative treatments for migraine headache, there have been no dedicated studies on antidepressant medications in vestibular migraine (VM). They have only been examined in small, multiple-treatment-arm studies. Amitriptyline and other tricyclics, along with venlafaxine, are thought to modulate endogenous pain mechanisms by inhibiting the reuptake of serotonin and noradrenaline. There were two studies involving amitriptyline, one of nortriptyline, and three of venlafaxine.

A retrospective before-and-after analysis of 13 patients treated with amitriptyline 25 mg daily found post-treatment improvements in vestibular symptoms (VAS 6.4–2.6, P = 0.001) and headache symptoms (VAS 7.5–2.8, P < 0.001) after 3 months. In a second study, amitriptyline 10 mg daily was given for 5 weeks to 24 patients, and despite the low dose and short duration of treatment, there were reductions in mean monthly vertigo frequency (17.5–5.4, no significance testing reported) and subjective vertigo and headache symptoms on a VAS. Side effects were common despite the low dose: xerostomia was reported in 67%, and daytime somnolence in 61%. The rate of loss to follow-up and treatment non-adherence was also high in this study (only 16 of 24 patients were analyzed), although this was also seen with other treatments. This may thus be better explained by methodological issues rather than amitriptyline being less well tolerated than other medications.

### Meclizine use and subsequent falls among patients with dizziness [^111i59ub]. JAMA Otolaryngology — Head & Neck Surgery (2025). Low credibility.

Among adults who present with dizziness, there is a critical need to identify and deimplement low-value and guideline-discordant care to mitigate the risk of falls over time. Meclizine, an antihistamine with anticholinergic properties, is the most used antiemetic vestibular suppressant in the US.

The objective of this study was to determine the factors associated with meclizine use and subsequent falls among patients aged 18 to 64 years and those aged 65 years or older with dizziness.

This cohort study assessed US commercial and Medicare Advantage claims among 805,454 adults (aged ≥ 18 years) with new diagnoses of dizziness between 2006 and 2015. Data were analyzed from July 2024 to February 2025. The exposure variable was the prescription of meclizine within 30 days of a new dizziness diagnosis.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: The main outcome measure was falls resulting in medical evaluation. Fall outcomes were attributed to meclizine use if they occurred within 60 days of a meclizine prescription. Associations of falls and meclizine with presentation setting, diagnoses, and sociodemographic characteristics were estimated with multivariable analyses.

The results showed that of the 805,454 individuals with dizziness (502,055 women [62%]; median age, 52 years [range, 18–87 years]), 8% received a meclizine prescription. Among those prescribed meclizine, 5,792 (9% overall; 10% [2,189/21,700] aged 18–64 years and 9% [3,603/40,138] aged ≥ 65 years) experienced an injurious fall. When adjusting for sociodemographics and clinical factors, a filled meclizine prescription was associated with subsequent falls.

### Intravenous lorazepam versus dimenhydrinate for treatment of vertigo in the emergency department: a randomized clinical trial [^114AdY7k]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2000). Low credibility.

To determine whether lorazepam is more effective than dimenhydrinate in relieving the symptom of vertigo in the emergency department setting, a prospective, randomized, double-blind trial was conducted in the ED of a county-owned, university-affiliated hospital. All adult patients who presented between January 24, 1998, and May 23, 1999, with the symptom of vertigo were eligible for inclusion.

The intervention involved varying the intravenous treatment between lorazepam, 2 mg, and dimenhydrinate, 50 mg. All patients received intravenous infusion of Ringer's lactate solution at a rate of 100 mL/h. Adequacy of randomization to the two treatment groups was assessed by comparing the patients' relevant baseline history, physical examination, and symptoms.

The predetermined primary outcome measurement was the patient's sensation of "vertigo with ambulation" one and two hours after treatment. Secondary outcome measurements included vertigo while lying, sitting, and turning the head, ability to ambulate as judged by the enrolling physician, and sensation of nausea and drowsiness one and two hours after treatment. It was also assessed whether the patient was "ready to go home" per patient report or physician assessment two hours after treatment. All patient symptoms were reported on 10-point scales. Outcome measurements were compared between the two treatment groups with a two-way repeated-measures analysis of variance, Student's t test, Mann-Whitney U, and chi-squared test as appropriate.

### Vestibular suppressants for benign paroxysmal positional vertigo: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^116vfEaJ]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is a common cause of acute dizziness. Medication use for its treatment remains common despite guideline recommendations against their use.

The objective was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of vestibular suppressants in patients with BPPV compared to placebo, no treatment, or canalith repositioning maneuvers (CRMs). We searched MEDLINE, Cochrane, EMBASE, and ClinicalTrials.gov from inception until March 25, 2022, for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing antihistamines, phenothiazines, anticholinergics, and/or benzodiazepines to placebo, no treatment, or a CRM.

Five RCTs, enrolling 296 patients, were included in the quantitative analysis. We found that vestibular suppressants may have no effect on symptom resolution at the point of longest follow-up (14–31 days in four studies) when evaluated as a continuous outcome (standardized mean difference -0.03 points, 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.53 to 0.47). Conversely, CRMs may improve symptom resolution at the point of longest follow-up as a dichotomous outcome when compared to vestibular suppressants (relative risk [RR] 0.63, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.78).

- **Vestibular suppressants had an uncertain effect on symptom resolution within 24h**: (mean difference [MD] 5 points, 95% CI -16.92 to 26.94).

- **Repeat emergency department (ED)/clinic visits**: (RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.12 to 1.15).

- **Patient satisfaction**: (MD 0 points, 95% CI -1.02 to 1.02).

- **Quality of life**: (MD -1.2 points, 95% CI -2.96 to 0.56).

### Medical management of Ménière's disease [^114hT57k]. The Laryngoscope (2008). Low credibility.

Ménière's disease (MD) is poorly understood in terms of its etiology, pathophysiology, clinical course, and treatment. Due to the absence of controlled clinical studies, empiric treatments with varying degrees of success have been utilized. This paper reviews the medical management of MD.

- **Study design**: Literature review.

- **Results**: Due to a lack of well-controlled studies, the medical management of MD remains empirical, focusing mainly on lifestyle changes, pharmacotherapy, and office-based procedures. The introduction of transtympanic therapies represents a significant therapeutic advancement that has largely replaced surgical intervention. The paper reviews a treatment algorithm for acute and chronic medical management.

- **Conclusions**: Despite the absence of a complete understanding of MD, medical management or its natural history leads to control of vertigo in the majority of patients. Basic research is needed to understand its pathophysiology so that targeted therapies can be developed and tested in well-controlled clinical trials.

### Neurological update: Dizziness [^114qC28H]. Journal of Neurology (2020). Low credibility.

The diagnosis and management of vertigo remain a challenge for clinicians, including those in general neurology. In recent years, there have been advances in the understanding of established vestibular syndromes and the development of treatments for existing vestibular diagnoses. In this update, I will review how our understanding of previously "unexplained" dizziness in the elderly is changing. I will explore novel insights into the pathophysiology of vestibular migraine and its relationship to the newly coined term 'persistent postural perceptual dizziness'. Finally, I will discuss how a simple bedside oculomotor assessment may help identify vestibular presentations of stroke.
