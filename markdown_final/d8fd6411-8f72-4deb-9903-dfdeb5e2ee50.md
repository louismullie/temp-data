## Question

What alternative options can we use to help with delirium and sleep in older adults?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about alternative options to help with delirium and sleep in older adults, while integrating the best available evidence and guidelines into a coherent plan, including any needed self-corrections and explicit citations before punctuation marks.

> Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether the clinical priority is prevention versus treatment of delirium and how sleep disturbance fits in as a risk factor, symptom, or co-target, because that choice changes the strategy across settings like ICU, general wards, postoperative care, ED, and long-term care.

> Then, I should verify that multicomponent non-pharmacological bundles are the foundation since they repeatedly reduce incident delirium, while single-agent pharmacologic prevention generally fails and can cause harm, so these bundles must be implemented early and with high fidelity [^111RGXB3] [^112XBQmC].

> Next, I need to check sleep-specific, targeted non-pharmacological interventions because sleep hygiene, circadian support, and behavioral therapies can improve sleep quality without the falls and cognitive adverse effects seen with sedative-hypnotics in older adults [^117UAEAq] [^117NTnch].

> After that, I will examine pharmacologic options with caution, distinguishing evidence for prevention versus treatment of delirium and for sleep improvement alone, and I must explicitly reconcile conflicting guidance around melatonin and the role of dexmedetomidine in ICU sedation strategies that also impact delirium risk [^114MhgKe] [^113Z3nxD].

> Then, I should tailor the approach by setting, because ICU sedation choices and environmental controls differ from ward-based HELP protocols or ED boarding strategies, and long-term care has its own evidence limitations and outcome priorities [^116ECGtU] [^114rXdWh].

> Finally, I need to ensure we systematically address modifiable risk factors, monitor using validated tools, and acknowledge evidence gaps while delivering a practical synthesis that prioritizes benefit and minimizes harm, especially around antipsychotic and benzodiazepine use in older adults [^113sm8N1] [^115vYGeR].

> Let me first confirm the clinical framing so I do not jump to conclusions: the initial decision point is prevention versus treatment and whether sleep disturbance is a target for risk reduction, symptom control, or both, and across settings the core principle is to start with multicomponent non-pharmacological care and reserve medications for specific indications or safety needs [^117VLSVn] [^114rXdWh].

> I will now examine the evidence for multicomponent bundles like HELP and ICU ABCDEF, because pooled trials and guideline consensus show consistent reductions in incident delirium on the order of 40–50%, even if effects on duration and other outcomes are less certain, and I should confirm that adherence and implementation support are necessary to sustain these benefits [^111RGXB3] [^112XBQmC].

> Wait, let me verify the essential elements to prioritize within these bundles since sleep, orientation, mobilization, pain control, hydration, and sensory optimization are the recurrent drivers of benefit, and environmental controls such as noise and light reduction, earplugs, and day–night light cues are repeatedly recommended though the lighting evidence is mixed in ICU [^116qowXL] [^116ECGtU].

> Hold on, I should double-check the role of environmental and design changes because emerging data suggest dynamic lighting and multicomponent room redesign may reduce delirium and improve melatonin rhythms, but these are early, small studies and should augment, not replace, core bundle elements like reorientation and early mobilization [^115zRLET] [^115vYGeR].

> Let me consider sleep-focused, non-pharmacological care when there is no active delirium: mindfulness-based interventions and CBT-I improve subjective sleep in older adults with durable effects and without dependency risk, while physical activity–based programs can also improve objective sleep metrics, and I need to ensure daytime light exposure and clustering of nocturnal care to preserve circadian rhythms [^117NTnch] [^117UAEAq].

> I should confirm that sensory strategies like earplugs and eye shades can reduce ICU delirium risk and improve perceived sleep despite bias concerns in source studies, so they are reasonable low-risk components within a multicomponent sleep hygiene plan, especially in noisy environments [^117E1jTo].

> Now, regarding pharmacologic prevention, I initially thought melatonin might be helpful because several older meta-analyses and small perioperative studies suggested benefit, but wait, let me verify against higher-quality and more recent evidence and guidelines that now recommend avoiding melatonin or ramelteon for delirium prevention due to lack of efficacy, with RCTs in medical inpatients showing no prevention or sleep benefit, and a recent ICU feasibility trial not designed to test efficacy yet underscoring uncertainty, so I should correct my initial impression and not recommend routine melatonin prophylaxis for delirium prevention outside of research or specific ICU protocols [^113Z3nxD] [^111fgcjX].

> Next, I should review sedation choices that influence delirium prevention in ICU care: dexmedetomidine likely reduces delirium compared with benzodiazepines and may be favored when light sedation and delirium reduction are priorities, while benzodiazepines increase delirium risk outside of alcohol withdrawal, so sedation strategies should minimize benzodiazepines whenever possible [^114MhgKe].

> But wait, what if the goal is sleep improvement rather than delirium prevention: I need to ensure that benzodiazepines and non-benzodiazepine hypnotics like zolpidem and temazepam are avoided in older adults due to falls and cognitive adverse effects, that melatonin may improve subjective sleep but not objective measures in hospitalized or MCI populations, and that choosing behavioral approaches remains the safer front line for chronic sleep complaints [^113oPVxR] [^112jhbe2].

> For active delirium, I should confirm that antipsychotics are reserved for severe agitation posing safety risks and used at the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration, that prophylactic antipsychotics like haloperidol are ineffective and potentially harmful, and that dexmedetomidine is an appropriate sedative for ventilated ICU patients with delirium when safety and light sedation targets are paramount, while benzodiazepines remain exceptions for alcohol or sedative withdrawal [^117VLSVn] [^115vYGeR].

> Let me tailor by setting so recommendations fit practice: in the ICU, implement ABCDEF with noise and light reduction, earplugs and eye shades, minimize nighttime care interruptions, and favor dexmedetomidine-based light sedation over benzodiazepines, noting the 2025 SCCM suggestion to consider melatonin contrasts with APA 2025 guidance to avoid it for delirium, which requires local protocol alignment and outcome monitoring if trialed [^116ECGtU] [^1144qJVN] [^1119LTCD].

> On general medical wards and in postoperative care, I should ensure HELP-style multicomponent prevention with aggressive pain assessment, early mobilization, hydration, reorientation, and sleep hygiene, recognizing that opioid-sparing multimodal analgesia and daytime activation are critical to protect sleep and cognition in older adults [^114rXdWh].

> In the ED, I need to check that routine delirium screening, non-pharmacologic prevention during boarding, family presence, reorientation, and sleep protection are emphasized, while avoiding prophylactic haloperidol and being cautious with any sedative use, acknowledging limited ED-specific trial data [^1128d7bQ].

> In long-term care, I should verify that evidence is sparse and heterogeneous for delirium prevention and treatment, so I will prioritize non-pharmacological sleep and circadian strategies, minimize disruptive nighttime care, and focus on core outcomes that matter to residents and caregivers when evaluating interventions [^113qaZuU].

> I need to ensure modifiable risk factors are systematically identified and treated: review and deprescribe anticholinergic and sedative medications when feasible, treat pain effectively, maintain hydration and nutrition, optimize hearing and vision with aids at the bedside, mobilize daily, prevent and treat infection, and manage bowel and bladder function to reduce precipitating factors for delirium and sleep disruption [^116qowXL] [^114rXdWh].

> Next, I should review monitoring strategies so that prevention and treatment efforts are trackable: use validated tools like the CAM or 4AT for incidence, MDAS for severity, and track adherence to bundle elements along with clinical outcomes such as falls, length of stay, and discharge disposition, aligning with emerging core outcome sets to improve comparability across programs [^113sm8N1] [^1126VjxV].

> Hold on, I should verify key controversies and gaps before closing: single-component non-pharmacologic interventions often fail in ICU when isolated, light therapy has mixed or negative evidence in ICU, technology-assisted delivery of multicomponent prevention looks feasible but needs stronger trials, and melatonin's role remains unsettled across settings with high-quality guidelines currently advising against its routine use for delirium prevention or treatment [^113HYmvi] [^1135zand] [^116F3AZp] [^113Z3nxD].

> Final synthesis, and let me double-check for internal consistency before I conclude: prioritize immediate implementation of multicomponent non-pharmacological bundles emphasizing sleep hygiene, reorientation, mobilization, pain control, hydration, and sensory optimization; optimize the sleep environment using earplugs, eye shades, and noise and light reduction while preserving day–night cues; avoid preventive pharmacologic therapy for delirium except for sedation strategies that favor dexmedetomidine in the ICU when appropriate; reserve antipsychotics for short-term control of dangerous agitation; for primary sleep problems without delirium, use mindfulness, CBT-I, and daytime activation rather than sedative-hypnotics; and do not use melatonin routinely for delirium prevention or treatment given current higher-quality evidence and guidelines, while transparently monitoring outcomes if institutions choose to pilot it under ICU-focused protocols [^112XBQmC] [^117E1jTo] [^114MhgKe] [^117VLSVn] [^113Z3nxD].

---

Non-pharmacological interventions are the first-line alternatives for delirium and sleep issues in older adults [^117VLSVn], with **multicomponent bundles** [^111RGXB3] (e.g. HELP [^114rXdWh], ABCDEF [^116JQaJs]) reducing delirium incidence by 30–53% [^112XBQmC] and improving sleep [^notfound]. CBT-I [^117UAEAq] and mindfulness meditation [^117NTnch] improve **sleep quality** and reduce **daytime impairment** [^1152rbXk]. Environmental strategies — noise/light reduction [^116ECGtU], earplugs/eye masks [^117E1jTo] [^117GHy7u], and consistent routines — support **sleep** and lower **delirium risk**.

Melatonin may help sleep [^116xiMe1] but is **not recommended for delirium prevention or treatment** [^1119LTCD] [^113Z3nxD]. Dexmedetomidine is **preferred over benzodiazepines** for ICU sedation when delirium reduction is prioritized [^112kweSC] [^114MhgKe]. Avoid benzodiazepines and anticholinergics due to delirium risk [^115vYGeR]; use antipsychotics only for severe agitation threatening safety [^1128d7bQ].

## Non-pharmacological interventions

### Multicomponent interventions

- **Hospital Elder Life Program (HELP)**: Multidisciplinary program addressing sleep hygiene, cognitive impairment, immobility, sensory impairment, and dehydration; reduces delirium incidence and improves sleep quality [^113Pmrgt] [^114rXdWh].

- **ABCDEF bundle**: ICU-focused bundle (Assess pain, Both spontaneous awakening/breathing trials, Choice of sedation, Delirium monitoring, Early mobility, Family engagement) reduces delirium and improves sleep [^115vYGeR] [^112XBQmC].

- **Environmental modifications**: Noise and light reduction [^116ECGtU], earplugs, eye masks [^117E1jTo], and consistent routines improve sleep and reduce delirium [^117GHy7u].

---

### Cognitive and behavioral interventions

- **Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I)**: Effective for sleep quality, duration, and efficiency in older adults [^117UAEAq] [^1152rbXk].

- **Mindfulness meditation**: Improves sleep quality and reduces daytime impairment [^117NTnch].

- **Sleep hygiene education**: Regular sleep schedules, reduced caffeine/alcohol, and bedtime routines improve sleep [^1152rbXk].

---

### Physical activity and mobility

Regular physical activity improves **sleep quality** [^1152rbXk] and reduces **delirium risk** [^112XBQmC], while **early mobilization** reduces delirium incidence and improves sleep among hospitalized older adults [^114rXdWh] [^116qowXL].

---

## Pharmacological alternatives

### Melatonin and melatonin receptor agonists

Melatonin may improve sleep quality in older adults [^116xiMe1], but evidence for delirium prevention or treatment is mixed [^112jhbe2] [^111fgcjX]; the APA 2025 **recommends against melatonin or ramelteon for delirium prevention or treatment** [^1119LTCD] [^113Z3nxD]. Ramelteon likewise shows **mixed evidence** for delirium prevention [^114AaYkU] and is **not recommended for delirium treatment** [^1119LTCD].

---

### Sedative alternatives

Dexmedetomidine is **preferred over benzodiazepines** for ICU sedation when delirium reduction is prioritized [^112kweSC] [^114MhgKe]. Clinicians should **avoid benzodiazepines and anticholinergics** because they increase delirium risk in older adults [^115vYGeR] [^1128d7bQ].

## Summary of evidence

| **Outcome** | **Multicomponent non-pharmacological bundles** | **CBT-I** | **Mindfulness meditation** | **Melatonin** | **Dexmedetomidine** |
|-|-|-|-|-|-|
| Delirium prevention | Strong evidence | Limited evidence | Limited evidence | Mixed evidence | Moderate evidence |
| Delirium treatment | Limited evidence | Limited evidence | Limited evidence | Not recommended | Limited evidence |
| Sleep improvement | Strong evidence | Strong evidence | Moderate evidence | Moderate evidence | Limited evidence |

Non-pharmacological interventions are the **preferred first-line approach** [^117VLSVn] for delirium and sleep disturbances in older adults, with multicomponent bundles [^112XBQmC], CBT-I [^117UAEAq], mindfulness [^117NTnch], and environmental modifications [^116ECGtU] showing benefit. Melatonin may help sleep [^116xiMe1] but is **not recommended for delirium** [^113Z3nxD]; dexmedetomidine is **preferred over benzodiazepines** [^112kweSC] when delirium reduction is a priority [^114MhgKe].

### World delirium awareness and quality survey in 2023-a worldwide point prevalence study [^115vYGeR]. Age and Ageing (2024). High credibility.

Multicomponent, non-pharmacological, bundled interventions such as the ABCDEF bundle or the HELP program have repeatedly demonstrated effectiveness in the reduction or prevention of delirium. Yet, their adoption into practice is limited and often short-lived, dependent on individual champions of evidence. Pain management, mobilisation, and adequate fluids were the top three reported non-pharmacological interventions to manage delirium; these are each essential components of multicomponent, non-pharmacological, bundled interventions. It is revealing that other essential components, such as re-orientation, were reported less than 75% of the time; this finding informs future projects and studies implementing delirium prevention interventions into routine clinical practice. Existing resources and learnings from previous implementation studies could further the chances of successful practice change.

Use of pharmacologics to prevent delirium is not supported by evidence, specifically benzodiazepines, haloperidol, or quetiapine. Several studies have shown that benzodiazepines increase the risk of delirium, and their use to sedate or treat agitation should be avoided. A study in a palliative care population reported increased delirium symptom profiles in the intention-to-treat arms for haloperidol and risperidone. For pharmacological management, both haloperidol and quetiapine are recommended in some guidelines for the reduction of hyperactive delirium symptoms (i.e. agitation) to maintain patient safety. Other guidelines, such as the Australian Clinical Standards, strongly recommend the avoidance of pharmacological intervention.

### Mindfulness meditation and improvement in sleep quality and daytime impairment among older adults with sleep disturbances: A randomized clinical trial [^117NTnch]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2015). High credibility.

The importance of this study lies in addressing sleep disturbances, which are prevalent among older adults and often go untreated. Treatment options remain limited, highlighting the need for community-accessible programs to improve sleep.

The objective of the study was to determine the efficacy of a mind-body medicine intervention, called mindfulness meditation, in promoting sleep quality among older adults with moderate sleep disturbances.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: A randomized clinical trial with two parallel groups was conducted from January 1 to December 31, 2012, at a medical research center. The study involved older adults with moderate sleep disturbances, with a mean (SD) age of 66.3 (7.4) years, using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) > 5 as a criterion.

- **Interventions**: Participants were randomized to a standardized mindful awareness practices (MAPs) intervention (n = 24) or a sleep hygiene education (SHE) intervention (n = 25). Both groups received a six-week intervention, with sessions lasting two hours per week, and assigned homework.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: The study was powered to detect between-group differences in moderate sleep disturbances as measured by the PSQI at postintervention. Secondary outcomes were related to sleep-related daytime impairment and included validated measures of insomnia symptoms, depression, anxiety, stress, fatigue, and inflammatory signaling via nuclear factor (NF)-κB.

- **Results**: Using an intent-to-treat analysis, participants in the MAPs group showed significant improvement relative to those in the SHE group on the PSQI. For the MAPs intervention, the mean (SD) PSQIs were 10.2 (1.7) at baseline and 7.4 (1.9) at post-intervention.

### Non-pharmacological interventions targeting sleep quality in older adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1152rbXk]. Aging & Mental Health (2023). Low credibility.

This review aimed to examine the available evidence about non-pharmacological interventions (NPIs) aimed at improving sleep quality in older adults without insomnia or dementia.

- **Methods**: Studies on NPIs targeting older adults' sleep were searched in the PsycInfo, PubMed, and Scopus databases, with no restriction on publication year up to September 2021. Studies on NPIs for older adults with no diagnosed sleep disorders were included, while those on pharmacological therapies and/or concerning pathological samples were excluded. The risk of bias was assessed using tools based on Joanna Briggs' criteria. The data extracted were meta-analyzed using random effects models for subgroups of NPIs.

- **Results**: Of the 1,893 records identified, 31 studies on NPIs (N = 2,224; range of mean ages: 60–78 years) were analyzed. All NPIs improved self-reported sleep quality, albeit to a different extent (physical activity: d = .97, 95% CI = .62, 1.32; psychological/psychoeducational, or NPIs that combined more than one sleep-targeting activity: d range: .21 to .97). Only the NPIs based on physical activity improved objectively-measured sleep, d = .31 (.04, .57). The methodological quality of most studies was limited. The most often used NPIs targeting sleep rely on physical activity and sensory stimulation with promising results on sleep quality for the former. More data are needed on psychological/psychoeducational NPIs and combined interventions to test their effectiveness. The methodological weaknesses of the available studies suggest their findings should be interpreted with caution.

### Pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions to prevent delirium in critically ill patients: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^114MhgKe]. Intensive Care Medicine (2021). High credibility.

To compare the effects of prevention interventions on delirium occurrence in critically ill adults, a comprehensive review was conducted. MEDLINE, Embase, PsychINFO, CINAHL, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Prospero, and the WHO international clinical trial registry were searched from inception to April 8, 2021. Randomized controlled trials involving pharmacological, sedation, non-pharmacological, and multi-component interventions for adult critically ill patients were included.

- **Methods**: Conventional pairwise meta-analyses and NMA within Bayesian random effects modeling were performed. We determined surface under the cumulative ranking curve values and mean rank. Reviewer pairs independently extracted data and assessed bias using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool and evidence certainty with GRADE. The primary outcome was delirium occurrence, while secondary outcomes included durations of delirium and mechanical ventilation, length of stay, mortality, and adverse effects.

- **Results**: Eighty trials met the eligibility criteria: 67.5% were pharmacological, 31.3% non-pharmacological, and 1.2% mixed pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions. For delirium occurrence, 11 pharmacological interventions (38 trials, N = 11,993) connected to the evidence network. Compared to placebo, dexmedetomidine (21/22 alpha 2 agonist trials were dexmedetomidine) probably reduces delirium occurrence (odds ratio (OR) 0.43, 95% Credible Interval (CrI) 0.21–0.85; moderate certainty). Compared to benzodiazepines, dexmedetomidine (OR 0.21, 95% CrI 0.08–0.51; low certainty) and sedation interruption (OR 0.21, 95% CrI 0.06–0.69; very low certainty) showed potential benefits.

### The efficacy of earplugs as a sleep hygiene strategy for reducing delirium in the ICU: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^117E1jTo]. Critical Care Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted to assess the efficacy of earplugs as an ICU strategy for reducing delirium.

- **Data sources**: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched using the terms "intensive care", "critical care", "earplugs", "sleep", "sleep disorders", and "delirium".

- **Study selection**: Intervention studies, both randomized and nonrandomized, assessing the efficacy of earplugs as a sleep hygiene strategy in patients admitted to a critical care environment were included. Studies were excluded if they included only healthy volunteers, did not report any outcomes of interest, did not contain an intervention group of interest, were crossover studies, or were only published in abstract form.

- **Data extraction**: Nine studies, published between 2009 and 2015 and including 1,455 participants, fulfilled the eligibility criteria and were included in the systematic review. The studies involved earplugs as an isolated intervention (n = 3), as part of a bundle with eye shades (n = 2), or alongside eye shades and additional sleep noise abatement strategies (n = 4). All studies demonstrated a high risk of bias.

- **Data synthesis**: Five studies, comprising 832 participants, reported on incident delirium. Earplug placement was associated with a relative risk of delirium of 0.59 (95% CI, 0.44–0.78), with no significant heterogeneity between studies (I, 39%; p = 0.16). Hospital mortality was reported in four studies (n = 481), with a relative risk of 0.77 (95% CI, 0.54–1.11; I, 0%; p < 0.001).

Compliance with earplug placement was noted, but further details were not provided in the document.

### Effectiveness of multicomponent nonpharmacological delirium interventions: A meta-analysis [^111RGXB3]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Delirium, an acute disorder with high morbidity and mortality, is often preventable through multicomponent nonpharmacological strategies. The efficacy of these strategies for preventing subsequent adverse outcomes has been limited to small studies at the time of writing.

- **Objective**: To evaluate available evidence on multicomponent nonpharmacological delirium interventions in reducing incident delirium and preventing poor outcomes associated with delirium.

- **Data sources**: PubMed, Google Scholar, ScienceDirect, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews from January 1, 1999, to December 31, 2013.

- **Study selection**: Studies examining the following outcomes were included: delirium incidence, falls, length of stay, rate of discharge to a long-term care institution (institutionalization), and change in functional or cognitive status.

- **Data extraction and synthesis**: Two experienced physician reviewers independently and blindly abstracted data on outcome measures using a standardized approach. The reviewers conducted quality ratings based on the Cochrane risk-of-bias criteria for each study.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Fourteen interventional studies were identified. The results for outcomes of delirium incidence, falls, length of stay, and institutionalization were pooled for the meta-analysis; however, heterogeneity limited our meta-analysis of the results for change in functional or cognitive status. Overall, 11 studies demonstrated significant reductions in delirium incidence (odds ratio [OR], 0.47; 95% CI, 0.38–0.58). Four randomized or matched trials reduced delirium incidence by 44%.

### A roadmap to advance delirium research: Recommendations from the NIDUS scientific think tank [^116JQaJs]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2020). Low credibility.

Given the complex, heterogeneous, and multifactorial causation of delirium, it is not surprising that single drug or non-pharmacologic intervention strategies have not demonstrated effectiveness for delirium prevention or treatment. Multicomponent non-pharmacologic strategies, such as the Hospital Elder Life Program (HELP, hospitalelderlifeprogram.org) or the ICU Liberation ABCDEF bundle, have demonstrated at least partial effectiveness, with more than 50% reduction in delirium across multiple studies. These strategies should be further evaluated to determine minimum elements, doses required, and optimal implementation strategies.

- **Prevention and treatment of delirium**: Novel approaches worth evaluating include new non-pharmacologic strategies, with recent examples including prehabilitation prior to elective surgery and the use of decision-support technology to facilitate management. In terms of pharmacologic approaches, further evaluation of intriguing drugs should be advanced, including dexmedetomidine, caffeine, acetaminophen, melatonin and agonists, and other sleep enhancement approaches.

Future treatment targets will arise out of pathophysiological research, and it is likely that treatments will need to be multicomponent. An evidence-based, multicomponent bundle that encompasses both non-pharmacological and pharmacological interventions targeted to proven risk factors and pathophysiologic pathways should be considered. Consideration of sequential approaches, targeting multiple biologic targets, is essential.

### A software to prevent delirium in hospitalised older adults: development and feasibility assessment [^116F3AZp]. Age and Ageing (2020). Low credibility.

Non-pharmacological interventions to prevent delirium are useful in hospitalised older adults; however, they are poorly implemented in clinical practice. We aimed to develop software for bedside use by hospitalised older adults to improve their access to these interventions.

- **Methods**: A transdisciplinary team composed of healthcare professionals, designers, engineers, and older adults participated in the development of the software. Scrum methodology was used to coordinate the work of the team, and the software was evaluated in a feasibility study.

- **Results**: A software for touchscreen mobile devices that supports Android 5.0 or later was produced, including modules for time-spatial re-orientation, cognitive stimulation, early mobilisation, sensorial support use promotion, sleep hygiene, and pain management optimisation. Horizontal disposition, use of colour contrast, and large interaction areas were used to improve accessibility. The software's usability and accessibility were evaluated in 34 older adults (average age 73.2 ± 9.1 years), showing that 91.1% of them accessed all the software functions without previous instructions. The clinical feasibility assessment showed that 83.3% of the 30 enrolled hospitalised patients (76 ± 8 years) completed the 5-day protocol of software usage during hospitalisation. Software use was associated with a decreased trend in delirium incidence from 5 of 32 (15.6%) at baseline to 2 of 30 (6.6%) after its implementation.

- **Conclusion**: A highly accessible and implementable software was designed to improve access to non-pharmacological interventions.

### The American Psychiatric Association practice guideline for the prevention and treatment of delirium [^113inEu8]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2025). High credibility.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for ICU delirium and specifically with respect to physical restraints, the APA 2025 guidelines recommend not to use physical restraints in patients with delirium, except when there is an imminent risk of injury to self or others. This should happen only after reviewing factors that may contribute to racial, ethnic, and other biases in decisions about restraint. Restraint use should be frequently monitored, with repeated reassessment of the ongoing risks and benefits compared to less restrictive interventions.

### Effect of a multimodal lifestyle intervention on sleep and cognitive function in older adults with probable mild cognitive impairment and poor sleep: A randomized clinical trial [^111EhSTU]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2020). Low credibility.

Poor sleep is common among older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and may contribute to further cognitive decline. Whether a multimodal lifestyle intervention that combines bright light therapy (BLT), physical activity (PA), and good sleep hygiene can improve sleep in older adults with MCI and poor sleep is unknown.

- **Objective**: To assess the effect of a multimodal lifestyle intervention on sleep in older adults with probable MCI and poor sleep.

- **Methods**: This was a 24-week proof-of-concept randomized trial involving 96 community-dwelling older adults aged 65–85 years with probable MCI (5 on the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index [PSQI]). Participants were allocated to either a multimodal lifestyle intervention (INT) or education plus attentional control (CON). INT participants received four once-weekly general sleep hygiene education classes, followed by 20 weeks of individually-timed BLT and individually-tailored PA promotion. Our primary outcome was sleep efficiency measured using the MotionWatch8© (MW8). Secondary outcomes included MW8-measured sleep duration, fragmentation index, wake-after-sleep-onset, latency, and PSQI-measured subjective sleep quality.

- **Results**: There were no significant between-group differences in MW8-measured sleep efficiency at 24 weeks (estimated mean difference [INT - CON]: 1.18%; 95% CI [-0.99, 3.34]) or any other objective estimate of sleep. However, INT participants reported significantly better subjective sleep quality at 24 weeks (estimated mean difference: -1.39).

### Clinical practice guidelines for the prevention and management of pain, agitation/sedation, delirium, immobility, and sleep disruption in adult patients in the ICU [^112PD5hT]. Critical Care Medicine (2018). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of ICU delirium, specifically concerning the management of sleep disturbances, the SCCM 2018 guidelines recommend nonpharmacological interventions. However, there is insufficient evidence to support the use of an adaptive mode of ventilation at night to improve sleep in critically ill adult patients in the ICU.

### Reporting of outcomes and measures in studies of interventions to prevent and/or treat delirium in older adults resident in long-term care: A systematic review [^113qaZuU]. Age and Ageing (2022). High credibility.

To inform the development of a core outcome set, we evaluated outcomes, definitions, measures, and measurement time points in clinical trials of interventions to prevent and/or treat delirium in older adults resident in long-term care (LTC).

- **Data sources**: We searched electronic databases, systematic review repositories, and trial registries from 1980 to December 10, 2021.

- **Study selection and data extraction**: We included randomized, quasi-randomized, and non-randomized intervention studies. We extracted data on study characteristics, outcomes, and measurement features. We assessed outcome reporting quality using the MOMENT study scoring system and categorized outcomes using the Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials taxonomy.

- **Data synthesis**: We identified 18 studies recruiting 5,639 participants. All evaluated non-pharmacological interventions; most (16 studies, 89%) addressed delirium prevention. We identified 12 delirium-specific outcomes (mean [SD] 2.4 [1.5] per study), with delirium incidence (14 studies, 78%) and severity (6 studies, 33%) being the most common. We found heterogeneity in the description of outcomes and measurement time points. The Confusion Assessment Method (three versions) was the most common measure used to ascertain delirium incidence (7 of 14 studies, 50%). We identified 25 non-delirium specific outcomes (mean [SD] 4.0 [2.3] per study), with hospital admission being the most commonly reported (9 studies, 50%).

In conclusion, we identified few studies of interventions for the prevention or treatment of delirium in older adults resident in LTC.

### Melatonin for the prevention of postoperative delirium in older adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115r1GTv]. BMC Geriatrics (2019). Low credibility.

Older surgical patients are at high risk of developing postoperative delirium. Non-pharmacological strategies are recommended for delirium prevention; however, no pharmacological agents have compelling evidence to decrease the incidence of delirium. The purpose of this study was to assess whether perioperative melatonin decreases the incidence of delirium in older adults undergoing surgical procedures.

- **Methods**: A systematic search using PubMed/Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and references of identified articles published in English between January 1990 and October 2017 was performed. Two independent reviewers screened titles and abstracts, then extracted data following a full-text review of included articles with consensus generation and bias assessment. Studies reporting outcomes for melatonin or ramelteon use to prevent delirium in postoperative hospitalized patients (mean age ≥ 50 years) were eligible for inclusion. Data were pooled using a fixed-effects model to generate a forest plot and obtain a summary odds ratio for the outcome of interest (delirium incidence). Cochran's Q and I² values were used to investigate heterogeneity.

- **Results**: Of 335 records screened, 6 studies were selected for the qualitative analysis and 6 were included in the meta-analysis (n = 1155). The mean age of patients in included studies ranged from 59 to 84 years. Patients in intervention groups typically received melatonin or ramelteon at daily doses of two to eight milligrams around cardiothoracic, orthopedic, or hepatic surgeries for one to nine days, starting on the evening before surgery.

### Prevention and treatment of traumatic brain injury-related delirium: A systematic review [^113B1Wxj]. Journal of Neurology (2023). Low credibility.

Our systematic review examines the effectiveness and safety of non-pharmacologic and pharmacologic interventions in preventing or treating traumatic brain injury (TBI)-related delirium in acute care.

- **Methods**: We searched four electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL/CDSR, and PsycINFO) to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-experimental, and observational studies. Eligible studies included adults with TBI, at least one comparator group, and delirium as an outcome, and took place in acute care. Two reviewers independently completed all study screening, data abstraction, and risk of bias assessment using the Cochrane risk of bias 2 tool for RCTs or risk of bias in non-randomized studies-of interventions tool for observational studies. We implemented the PROGRESS-Plus framework to describe social determinants of health (SDoH) reporting.

- **Results**: We identified 20,022 citations, reviewed 301 in full text, and included eight studies in the descriptive synthesis. The mean age of study participants ranged from 32 to 62 years. In 12.5% of included studies, SDoH were reported. Included studies had moderate-to-high risk of bias. Studies compared reorientation programs and an intervention bundle to usual care, but these interventions were not better than usual care in treating TBI-related delirium. Individual studies found that rosuvastatin and aripiprazole were more efficacious than placebo, and dexmedetomidine was more efficacious than propofol and haloperidol for preventing TBI-related delirium. No studies reported safety as the primary outcome.

### Postoperative use of sleep aids and delirium in older adults after major surgery: A retrospective cohort study [^114AaYkU]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2024). Low credibility.

Sleep aids are commonly prescribed to treat sleep disturbance, a modifiable risk factor for postoperative delirium in older patients. The use of melatonin receptor agonists in the postoperative period has been increasing. However, the comparative safety of melatonin receptor agonists, zolpidem, and temazepam remains uncertain.

- **Methods**: This retrospective study included 22,083 patients aged 65 years and older who initiated melatonin receptor agonists, zolpidem, or temazepam after major surgery in the Premier Healthcare Database from 2009 to 2018. We performed propensity score-based overlap weighting and estimated the risk ratio (RR) and risk difference (RD) of postoperative delirium as the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes included a composite of delirium or new antipsychotic initiation, pneumonia, and in-hospital mortality.

- **Results**: The mean age of the study population was 78 years (SD, 7), and 50% were female. There was no significant difference in the risk of postoperative delirium among patients treated with melatonin receptor agonists (3.4%, reference group), zolpidem (2.9%; RR [95% CI], 0.9 [0.7–1.2]; RD [95% CI] per 100 persons, -0.3 [-1.1 to 0.6]), and temazepam (3.1%; RR [95% CI], 0.9 [0.7–1.1]; RD [95% CI] per 100 persons, -0.5 [-1.2 to 0.3]). The risks of delirium or new antipsychotic initiation, pneumonia, and in-hospital mortality were also similar among all groups.

- **Conclusions**: Melatonin receptor agonists were not associated with a lower risk of postoperative delirium and other adverse outcomes compared to zolpidem and temazepam in older adults after major surgery.

### Can we improve delirium prevention and treatment in the emergency department? A systematic review [^111HKg2N]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2022). Low credibility.

Though it is recommended that pharmacologic management of delirium is reserved for those at immediate risk of harming themselves or others, antipsychotic medications and sedatives are commonly used to treat delirium in the ED setting. Unfortunately, neither the potential benefits nor harms of these pharmacological strategies are rigorously based on any ED research. Haloperidol was found to be ineffective in preventing delirium in ED patients at high risk for delirium. This is consistent with previous meta‐analyses that discourage the use of haloperidol for delirium treatment or prevention in non‐ED settings, and thus our systematic review does not support the safety or effectiveness of prophylactic haloperidol to prevent delirium.

Melatonin was the only other medication identified in our systematic review to prevent delirium in older ED patients. The finding that low‐dose melatonin could potentially prevent delirium is consistent with prior studies by Hatta et al. and a meta‐analysis by Campbell et al. Further research is needed to explore whether this would be helpful for ED patients arriving during daylight hours, or those boarding overnight in the ED. With these caveats, our review raises the question of using melatonin for patients at risk of delirium who have to board in the ED overnight. Compelling research from the inpatient and ICU settings suggest that multifactorial programs can prevent delirium. These include the Hospital Elder Life Program implemented in inpatient units, and the ABCDEF bundle in ICUs. We identified four non‐RCT studies on multifactorial programs.

### Low-dose melatonin for prevention of delirium in critically ill patients: A multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled feasibility trial [^111fgcjX]. Chest (2025). High credibility.

Delirium is a common and serious syndrome of acute brain dysfunction associated with negative outcomes. Melatonin may have a role in delirium prevention for critically ill adults based on data from noncritically ill patient populations. Our objective was to assess the feasibility of a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled trial testing the hypothesis that low-dose melatonin prevents delirium in adults who are critically ill.

- **Research question**: Does low-dose melatonin prevent delirium in critically ill adults?

- **Study design and methods**: We conducted this 3-arm feasibility trial in 3 tertiary academic ICUs. Included participants were ≥ 18 years of age, confirmed free of delirium at enrollment, and anticipated to require a > 48-hour ICU stay. We randomized participants to nightly melatonin 0.5 mg, 2 mg, or placebo. Feasibility outcomes were protocol adherence and recruitment rates. Our primary feasibility target was ≥ 85% (± 5% margin of error) of drug doses administered as per protocol. Secondary objectives were to explore adverse drug effects, melatonin pharmacokinetics, and clinical outcomes.

- **Results**: We screened 2,259 patients and excluded 1,863 patients (82.5%), resulting in 396 eligible patients, of whom 71 provided consent, for a recruitment rate of 0.8 patients/mo/site. Median age was 60.5 years (interquartile range [IQR], 48–67 years), and median admission Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score was 7 (IQR, 3–10). Percentage drug administration protocol adherence per patient was a median of 100% (IQR, 92.3%-100%) or a mean of 88.7% (SD, 24.4%).

### SIGN 157: Risk reduction and management of delirium [^116qowXL]. SIGN (2019). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for ICU delirium, more specifically with respect to non-pharmacological prevention, SIGN 2019 guidelines recommend considering the following components as part of the care for patients at risk of delirium:

- **Orientation and sensory aids**: Ensure patients have their glasses and hearing aids.
- **Promoting sleep hygiene**: Encourage practices that support restful sleep.
- **Early mobilization**: Facilitate early physical activity and mobility.
- **Pain control**: Manage and alleviate pain effectively.
- **Postoperative care**: Focus on prevention, early identification, and treatment of postoperative complications.
- **Hydration and nutrition**: Maintain optimal hydration and nutritional status.
- **Regulation of bodily functions**: Ensure regular bladder and bowel function.
- **Supplementary oxygen**: Provide additional oxygen if appropriate.

### Modification in ICU design may affect delirium and circadian melatonin: A proof of concept pilot study [^115zRLET]. Critical Care Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

Nonpharmacologic delirium management is recommended by guidelines, yet studies on the impact of ICU design remain limited. This study primarily aimed to determine whether a multicomponent change in room design can prevent ICU delirium. Additionally, the influence of lighting conditions on serum melatonin levels was assessed.

- **Design**: Prospective observational cohort pilot study.

- **Setting**: The new design concept was implemented in two two-bed ICU rooms of a university hospital. The design included modifications focused on stress relief and featured a new dynamic lighting system.

- **Patients**: The study involved seventy-four adult patients who were critically ill, on mechanical ventilation, and had an expected ICU stay of at least 48 hours. These patients were treated in either modified or standard rooms.

- **Interventions**: None.

- **Measurements and main results**: The clinical examination incorporated a prospective assessment of sedation depth, delirium, and pain every 8 hours using validated scores. Blood samples for serum melatonin profiles were collected every 4 hours for a maximum of three 24-hour periods. Analysis included all seventy-four patients, where 76% (n = 28) of patients in standard rooms developed delirium compared to 46% (n = 17) in modified rooms (p = 0.017). Patients in standard rooms exhibited 2.3 times higher delirium severity (odds ratio = 2.292; 95% CI, 1.582–3.321; p < 0.0001). Light intensity, evaluated by circadian effective irradiance, significantly influenced serum melatonin levels (p < 0.0001).

### Can we improve delirium prevention and treatment in the emergency department? A systematic review [^116rQ4fg]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2022). Low credibility.

Pharmacological

- **Positive study**: Al-Alma et al. examined the impact of melatonin compared to placebo on the prevention of delirium among older adults admitted to the internal medicine unit from the emergency department. They provided patients with 0.5 mg melatonin at night, preventing delirium with a Number Needed to Treat (NNT) of 6. Two patients (2/72 = 2.8%) who received melatonin reported side effects, describing nightmares; however, the overall risk of bias was high.

- **Negative study**: Schrijver et al. evaluated the use of haloperidol compared to placebo on the prevention of delirium among high-risk older adults (age ≥ 70) hospitalized from the emergency department. They identified a high-risk population using the Veiligheidsmanagementsysteem (VMS) delirium risk assessment tool and randomized them to 1 mg prophylactic haloperidol or placebo. The study did not reach the target sample size, and the results did not show any significant reduction in incident delirium.

### Cognitive behavioural interventions for sleep problems in adults aged 60+ [^117UAEAq]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). High credibility.

The prevalence of sleep problems in adulthood increases with age. While not all sleep changes are pathological in later life, severe disturbances may lead to depression, cognitive impairments, deterioration of quality of life, significant stresses for carers, and increased healthcare costs. The most common treatment for sleep disorders, particularly insomnia, is pharmacological. The efficacy of non-drug interventions has been suggested to be slower than pharmacological methods, but with no risk of drug-related tolerance or dependency. Cognitive and behavioural treatments for sleep problems aim to improve sleep by changing poor sleep habits, promoting better sleep hygiene practices, and challenging negative thoughts, attitudes, and beliefs about sleep.

- **Objectives**: To assess the efficacy of cognitive-behavioural interventions in improving sleep quality, duration, and efficiency amongst older adults (aged 60 and above).

- **Search strategy**: The following databases were searched: MEDLINE (1966 - October 2001); EMBASE (1980 - January 2002); CINAHL (1982 - January 2002); PsychINFO (1887 to 2002); The Cochrane Library (Issue 1, 2002); National Research Register (NRR [2002]). Bibliographies of existing reviews in the area, as well as all trial reports obtained, were searched. Experts in the field were consulted.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials of cognitive behavioural treatments for primary insomnia where 80% or more of participants were over 60. Participants must have been screened to exclude those with dementia and/or depression.

### Review of postoperative delirium in geriatric patients after hip fracture treatment [^1161fJ6X]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2022). Low credibility.

In 2015, the American Geriatrics Society published a best practice statement on postoperative delirium in older adults. This statement highlights three key non-pharmacologic components to prevent and treat postoperative delirium:

- **Formal education programs**: Implement programs for healthcare systems and hospitals.
- **Non-pharmacologic interventions**: Implement multicomponent interventions to prevent postoperative delirium in high-risk patients under the supervision of an interdisciplinary team.
- **Interdisciplinary team interventions**: Deliver multicomponent interventions once a patient has been diagnosed with postoperative delirium.

The statement also indicates that there is insufficient evidence regarding the use of delirium units for treatment. Multicomponent interventions specifically target minimizing delirium risk, such as reducing the time to surgery, sensory enhancements (e.g. visual aids, hearing aids), mobility enhancement, cognitive stimulation, nutritional and fluid repletion enhancement, sleep enhancement, and environmental familiarity.

Table 2 provides insights into non-pharmacologic and pharmacologic approaches to clinically managing postoperative delirium. Non-pharmacologic interventions for prevention have shown to reduce the incidence of delirium by 27–100%. Despite the reduction in incidence, one study found that mortality, length of stay, functional status, and disposition remained similar in both the intervention and non-intervention groups. Other studies identified similar outcomes.

### Non-pharmacological interventions in the prevention of delirium [^116tsQU1]. Age and Ageing (2009). Low credibility.

Delirium is a serious and common disorder, especially among older people in inpatient units. Numerous modifiable or manageable delirium risk factors have been identified; as a result, there is now a widespread notion that many cases of delirium can be prevented. In this review, published data evaluating non-pharmacological interventions for delirium prevention were assessed in relation to their efficacy. Currently, most published studies are based on direct targeting of risk factors and/or the introduction of educational programs to increase staff knowledge and awareness.

However, there continues to be a dearth of randomized controlled trials evaluating non-pharmacological interventions, partly because of the inherent difficulties associated with delirium research in general and with the evaluation of non-pharmacological interventions in particular. Instead, many of the available studies have been observational or non-randomized in nature. Nevertheless, the majority of these support a role for non-pharmacological interventions in delirium prevention. While more research is certainly needed, the majority of available data are based on best practice protocols, guidelines, and interventions. Hence, a consistent and concerted effort is now justified to introduce non-pharmacological prevention strategies across units to help tackle the increasingly prevalent delirium among older people.

### A systematic review of non-pharmacological interventions to improve nighttime sleep among residents of long-term care settings [^113oPVxR]. BMC Geriatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Both benzodiazepines and non-benzodiazepine receptor agonist hypnotics have been associated with an increased risk of falls and fractures in older adults. These challenges reinforce the need to consider non-pharmacological approaches within the unique physical environment and institutional milieu of long-term care facilities. The potential for sleep or circadian rhythm disturbances is linked to an increased vulnerability to environmental challenges in these facilities.

For some residents, a non-stimulating environment may lead to excessive daytime and early evening napping, exacerbating sleep disturbances. Others may experience an over-stimulating nighttime environment due to light and noise or exposure to disruptive behaviors, including pain, discomfort, repetitive vocalizations, and wandering. Staff routines, such as nighttime incontinence care, are also disruptive to sleep maintenance.

The problems associated with existing pharmacological treatments, coupled with institutional environments that can further disrupt sleep, mean that non-pharmacological interventions should be considered to help prevent or manage sleep disturbances. Consistent with the recommendations of the American Geriatrics Society and the National Institute on Aging, the objective of this systematic review is to identify and evaluate the literature documenting the outcomes associated with non-pharmacological interventions to improve nighttime sleep among long-term care residents.

### Delirium in older persons: Advances in diagnosis and treatment [^1126VjxV]. JAMA (2017). Low credibility.

- **Importance**: Delirium is defined as an acute disorder of attention and cognition. It is a common, serious, and often fatal condition among older patients. Although often underrecognized, delirium has serious adverse effects on the individual's function and quality of life, as well as broad societal effects with substantial health care costs.

- **Objective**: To summarize the state of the art in the diagnosis and treatment of delirium and to highlight critical areas for future research to advance the field.

- **Evidence review**: A search of Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library was conducted for the past six years, from January 1, 2011, until March 16, 2017, using a combination of controlled vocabulary and keyword terms. Since delirium is more prevalent in older adults, the focus was on studies in elderly populations. Studies based solely in the intensive care unit (ICU) and non-English-language articles were excluded.

- **Findings**: Of 127 articles included, 25 were clinical trials, 42 cohort studies, 5 systematic reviews and meta-analyses, and 55 were other categories. A total of 11,616 patients were represented in the treatment studies. Advances in diagnosis have included the development of brief screening tools with high sensitivity and specificity, such as the 3-Minute Diagnostic Assessment, 4 A's Test, and proxy-based measures such as the Family Confusion Assessment Method. Measures of severity, such as the Confusion Assessment Method-Severity Score, can aid in monitoring response to treatment, risk stratification, and assessing prognosis. Nonpharmacologic approaches focused on risk factors.

### Melatonin and sleep in preventing hospitalized delirium: A randomized clinical trial [^112jhbe2]. The American Journal of Medicine (2018). High credibility.

Studies suggest that melatonin may prevent delirium, a condition of acute brain dysfunction occurring in 20%-30% of hospitalized older adults that is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. We examined the effect of melatonin on delirium prevention in hospitalized older adults while measuring sleep parameters as a possible underlying mechanism.

This was a randomized clinical trial measuring the impact of 3 mg of melatonin nightly on incident delirium and both objective and subjective sleep in inpatients aged ≥ 65 years, admitted to internal medicine wards (non-intensive care units). Delirium incidence was measured by bedside nurses using the confusion assessment method. Objective sleep measurements, including nighttime sleep duration, total sleep time per 24 hours, and sleep fragmentation as determined by average sleep bout length, were obtained via actigraphy. Subjective sleep quality was measured using the Richards Campbell Sleep Questionnaire.

Delirium occurred in 22.2% (8/36) of subjects who received melatonin compared to 9.1% (3/33) who received placebo (P = 0.19). Melatonin did not significantly change objective or subjective sleep measurements. Nighttime sleep duration and total sleep time did not differ between subjects who became delirious and those who did not. However, delirious subjects experienced more sleep fragmentation (sleep bout length 7.0 ± 3.0 vs 9.5 ± 5.3 min; p = 0.03).

Melatonin given as a nightly dose of 3 mg did not prevent delirium in non-intensive care unit hospitalized patients or improve subjective or objective sleep.

### Ocular light exposure interventions for sleep, circadian rhythms, rest-activity cycles, mood, and cognitive function in older adults: An overview of Cochrane and non-Cochrane systematic reviews [^116Maifn]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). High credibility.

The global population is rapidly ageing, with the number of people over 60 years old projected to almost double from 12% to 22% between 2015 and 2050. Due to their predisposition to age‐related pathologies, older adults are particularly vulnerable to sleep disturbances, mood disorders, and cognitive decline. These challenges are usually interconnected and can severely impact an ageing individual's daily functioning, quality of life (QoL), and health span. Addressing these challenges is essential for enhancing the well‐being of older adults. Therefore, non‐pharmacological interventions, including ocular light exposure interventions, have become a topic of growing academic and clinical interest as a therapeutic approach.

Over the last two decades, the importance of light for human health and well‐being has become increasingly evident. Light exposure regulates circadian rhythms and sleep‐wake cycles, which are crucial for maintaining overall health. In contrast, 'suboptimal' light exposure has been linked to poor health outcomes, including mood disorders, cognitive decline, fatigue, and sleep disorders. Achieving 'optimal' light exposure levels provides many benefits, including improved sleep quality, circadian rhythm, mood, and cognitive function.

The circadian rhythm is fundamental to nearly every cellular, physiological, and behavioural process in the human body. This makes circadian rhythms not just a peripheral concern, but central to maintaining health and preventing disease. The disruption of these daily rhythms has been implicated in various health conditions.

### The effectiveness of non-pharmacological interventions in reducing the incidence and duration of delirium in critically ill patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113HYmvi]. Intensive Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

To evaluate the effect of non-pharmacological interventions versus standard care on the incidence and duration of delirium in critically ill patients, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis. We searched electronic and grey literature for randomized clinical trials up to March 2018. Two reviewers independently screened, selected, and extracted data. Meta-analysis was undertaken using random effects modeling.

We identified 15 trials involving 2,812 participants. Eleven trials reported the incidence of delirium. Pooled data from four trials of bright light therapy showed no significant effect between groups (n = 829 participants, RR 0.45, 99% CI 0.10–2.13, P = 0.19, very low-quality evidence). Seven trials of various individual interventions also failed to report any significant effects. A total of eight trials reported the duration of delirium. Pooled data from two trials of multicomponent physical therapy showed no significant effect [n = 404 participants, MD (days) -0.65, 99% CI -2.73 to 1.44, P = 0.42, low-quality of evidence]. Four trials of various individual interventions also reported no significant effects. Notably, a trial of family voice reorientation showed a beneficial effect [n = 30, MD (days) -1.30, 99% CI -2.41 to -0.19, P = 0.003, very low-quality evidence].

The evidence does not support the use of non-pharmacological interventions in reducing the incidence and duration of delirium in critically ill patients. Future research should consider well-designed and well-described multicomponent interventions and include adequately defined outcome measures.

### Methodologic innovation in creating clinical practice guidelines: Insights from the 2018 Society of Critical Care Medicine pain, agitation/sedation, delirium, immobility, and sleep disruption guideline effort [^117Mytvg]. Critical Care Medicine (2018). High credibility.

To describe novel guideline development strategies, the Society of Critical Care Medicine's 2018 clinical practice guidelines for pain, agitation/sedation, delirium, immobility/rehabilitation, and sleep disruption in critically ill adults were created and implemented. The approach involved critical illness survivors from start to finish and utilized the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation methodology for making recommendations. This method identified evidence gaps and developed communication strategies to mitigate challenges.

- **Setting/subjects**: Thirty-two experts from five countries participated across five topic-specific sections. This group included four methodologists, two medical librarians, four critical illness survivors, and two Society of Critical Care Medicine support staff.

- **Interventions**: Unique approaches included critical illness survivor involvement to ensure patient-centered questions and recommendations. Qualitative and semiquantitative approaches were used for developing descriptive statements by following a three-step approach to generating final recommendations. Systematic identification of evidence gaps was also integral.

- **Measurements and main results**: Critical illness survivors contributed to prioritizing topics, questions, outcomes, evidence interpretation, recommendation formulation, and article review. Their involvement ensured that their values and preferences were considered in the guidelines. Descriptive statements were formulated using comprehensive literature reviews supported by qualitative and semiquantitative approaches.

### Non-pharmacological interventions for sleep disturbances in people with dementia [^116yQhoC]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). High credibility.

Sleep disturbances occur frequently in people with dementia, with a reported prevalence of up to 40%. Common problems include an increased number and duration of awakenings, as well as an increased percentage of light sleep. These disturbances are associated with several issues for individuals with dementia, their relatives, and carers. For people with dementia, sleep disturbances may lead to the worsening of cognitive symptoms and challenging behaviors, such as restlessness or wandering, and further harms like accidental falls. They are also associated with significant carer distress and have been reported as a factor contributing to the institutionalization of individuals with dementia.

Given the unsatisfactory results from pharmacological approaches, there is a need to synthesize research evidence on non-pharmacological strategies to improve sleep for people with dementia. Since interventions are often complex, consisting of more than one active component and are implemented in complex contexts, identifying effective intervention components can be challenging.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the benefits and harms of non-pharmacological interventions on sleep disturbances in people with dementia compared to usual care, no treatment, other non-pharmacological interventions, or any drug treatment intended to improve sleep, and to describe the components and processes of any complex intervention included.

- **Search methods**: We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search was conducted on 13 January 2022.

- **Selection criteria**: We included individually or cluster-randomized controlled trials.

### Melatonin for the prevention of postoperative delirium in older adults: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^1138PUgR]. BMC Geriatrics (2019). Low credibility.

Currently, there is a very small body of literature examining the use of melatonin for the prevention of postoperative delirium in older adults. In conjunction with clinician input, the exhaustive literature search was driven by a health sciences librarian who is highly experienced in systematic reviews. While the body of literature is small at this time, the findings of this meta-analysis suggest that perioperative melatonin administration may significantly reduce the incidence of delirium in older adults undergoing surgical procedures — a common, yet detrimental, complication of surgery in this population.

The odds ratio was highly sensitive to the removal of the one study that did not have results in favor of melatonin reducing the risk of delirium, resulting in a reduction of the odds ratio from 0.63 to 0.31, and heterogeneity to zero. One possible explanation for the negative results in this particular study may be due to discrepancies among the two study groups related to prior delirium. Even though statistics were not reported for the baseline characteristics, the group receiving melatonin appeared to have a greater percentage of patients with a history of delirium (23.7% versus 17.2% in the placebo group), which is a well-established risk factor for developing delirium.

Additionally, the authors of the de Jonghe study noted that there was an increased probability of type 2 error, as they had a large number of patients who were excluded post-randomization (withdrawal of consent, delirium at admission, loss to follow-up, etc). Only 378 patient data were analyzed.

### Can we improve delirium prevention and treatment in the emergency department? A systematic review [^1128d7bQ]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2022). High credibility.

Delirium is a disturbance of attention, awareness, and a change in baseline cognition. Delirium is common in the emergency department (ED), especially in older adults. Between 6% and 38% of older adults in the ED have incident delirium, defined as new development of delirium after arrival, or prevalent delirium, defined as those who present to the ED with delirium. Importantly, ED delirium is associated with increases in the length of hospital stay and mortality and decreases in independence and cognitive function. Due to the prevalence of delirium in the ED setting and the associated morbidity and mortality, there is growing support for ED-based strategies to improve identification, management, and prevention of delirium. Among accredited level 1 and level 2 geriatric EDs, 90% of level 1 and 40% of level 2 geriatric EDs reported protocols for delirium screening. In addition, many have implemented strategies to decrease delirium incidence.

The authors previously synthesized seven Cochrane systematic reviews that summarized delirium prevention or treatment trials across a variety of healthcare settings. Multifactorial interventions, including individualized care, an educational component, reorientation, and early mobilization, often effectively reduce the incidence of delirium in the inpatient setting. Since 2012, four Cochrane reviews have summarized pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic delirium interventions in both the hospital setting and long-term care. The generalizability of pharmacological and nonpharmacological interventions to the ED setting remains critical for improving outcomes in this context.

### A focused update to the clinical practice guidelines for the prevention and management of pain, anxiety, agitation/sedation, delirium, immobility, and sleep disruption in adult patients in the ICU [^112kweSC]. Critical Care Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for ICU delirium, especially concerning sedation management, the SCCM 2025 guidelines recommend considering dexmedetomidine over propofol for sedation in mechanically ventilated adult patients admitted to the ICU. This is particularly recommended when light sedation and/or a reduction in delirium are of the highest priorities.

### Enhancing sleep quality for nursing home residents with dementia: a pragmatic randomized controlled trial of an evidence-based frontline huddling program [^111n8kSt]. BMC Geriatrics (2021). High credibility.

Due to imperfect correlations between actigraphic sleep data and self- or other ratings of resident sleep, four supplementary sleep measurements will be collected from staff to triangulate the primary sleep outcome data:

- **Sleep via staff rating**: A clinical, global impression of resident sleep change at the end of each 7-night actigraph sleep measurement period and at the end of each week of the 6-week sleep intervention period.

- **Staff-identified sleep-related concerns**: Huddle facilitators lead the huddle team to identify and track up to 2 additional symptoms or behaviors of concern potentially related to sleep (e.g. nighttime agitation, pain), measured on the same schedule as the 'sleep via staff rating'.
- **Inter-resident sleep variability**: Medical record data to be collected at the end of the 22-week trial measurement period on the following:
	1. Changes in any sedating medications and/or dosages
	2. Incidents of delirium
	3. Any urinary tract infections
	4. Doses of any sedating medications, including as-needed ones

- **Sleep from the Minimum Data Set (MDS)**: Two MDS items pertaining to sleep will be included:
	1. "Trouble falling or staying asleep or sleeping too much"
	2. "Over the past 5 days, has pain made it hard for you to sleep at night?"

Our secondary outcomes will come from the nursing homes' MDS 3.0. Every Medicare-certified nursing home is required to complete an MDS assessment for every resident at admission, quarterly, and at discharge, in addition to whenever the resident's status changes. We will be using the MDS to collect details about…

### Melatonin for the prevention of postoperative delirium in older adults: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^112pBfBZ]. BMC Geriatrics (2019). Low credibility.

Given that limited pharmacological interventions are available to prevent postoperative delirium at this time, the role of melatonin is worthy of investigation. The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to assess whether perioperative melatonin administration affects the incidence of delirium in older adults undergoing surgical procedures.

### Melatonin for the prevention of postoperative delirium in older adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1147SVa4]. BMC Geriatrics (2019). Low credibility.

An experienced health sciences librarian developed a comprehensive search strategy with clinical input from the lead authors. An electronic search was systematically conducted in four bibliographic databases: PubMed/Medline (NLM); Embase (Elsevier); PsycINFO (Ebsco); and CINAHL (Ebsco) in November 2017. Additionally, the reference lists of obtained articles and relevant systematic reviews were screened, and searches in pertinent websites were conducted to identify further studies that reported melatonin use perioperatively in hospitalized adults from January 1990 to October 2017. This timeframe was selected to coincide with the development of the Beers Criteria, which was initially published in 1991 and categorized potentially inappropriate medications for older adults, including agents that may cause or exacerbate delirium. A combination of controlled vocabulary and keywords was used to search the databases. To identify delirium, terms such as emergence delirium, perioperative delirium, postoperative delirium, organic brain syndrome, and acute confusion were used; while synonymous terms for melatonin such as ramelteon and melatonin receptor agonist were used to make the search as comprehensive as possible. The search strategy for NLM, which was used to develop search strategies for subsequent databases, is summarized in a figure not included in this text. The protocol for this study has not been previously published.

- **Study selection**: All identified studies were title screened to identify studies that appeared to address our study aim.

### Melatonin does not reduce delirium severity in hospitalized older adults: Results of a randomized placebo-controlled trial [^111irzzG]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2024). High credibility.

Delirium is common in older inpatients, causing distress, cognitive decline, and death. Therapies are unsatisfactory, limited by lack of efficacy and adverse effects. There is an urgent need for effective delirium treatment. The sleep-wake cycle is disturbed in delirium: endogenous melatonin is perturbed, but exogenous melatonin is a safe and effective medication for sleep disorders. This study aims to determine the effect of oral melatonin 5 mg immediate release (IR) nightly for five nights on the severity of delirium in older (≥ 65 years) medical inpatients.

- **Methods**: This was a double-blinded, randomized controlled trial in general internal medicine units of a tertiary teaching hospital. Older inpatients with Confusion Assessment Method positive, hyperactive or mixed delirium within 48 hours of admission or onset of in-hospital delirium were included. The primary outcome was the change in delirium severity measured with the Memorial Delirium Assessment Scale (MDAS). A previous pilot trial showed 120 participants randomized 1:1 to melatonin or placebo would provide 90% power to demonstrate a 3-point reduction in the MDAS.

- **Results**: One hundred and twenty participants were randomized, 61 to melatonin 5 mg and 59 to placebo. The medication was well tolerated. The mean MDAS improvement was 4.9 (SD 7.6) in the melatonin group and 5.4 (SD 7.2) in the placebo group, p-value 0.42, indicating a non-significant difference. A post-hoc analysis showed the length of stay (LOS) was shorter in the intervention group (median 9 days [Interquartile Range (IQR) 4, 12] vs. placebo group 10 [IQR 6, 16]).

### Novel applications of sleep pharmacology as delirium therapeutics [^116xiMe1]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2025). Low credibility.

Sleep-wake and circadian disruption (SCD) is a core feature of delirium. It has been hypothesized that SCD contributes to delirium pathogenesis; therefore, interventions that prevent or reverse SCD represent an array of promising opportunities in relation to delirium. This review explores the relationship between sleep-wake/circadian physiology and delirium pathophysiology with a focus on neurotransmitter systems.

- **Pharmacological approaches**: Across potential targets aimed at preventing or treating delirium, three broad approaches are considered:

	- **Sleep preservation**: Pharmacological mechanisms that contribute to physiological sleep may preserve or restore next-day cognition in patients with or at risk for delirium (e.g. alpha 2 agonists, dopamine 2 antagonists, serotonin 2 A antagonists, dual orexin receptor antagonists, or GHB agonists).

	- **Wakefulness promotion**: Pharmacological mechanisms that promote wakefulness during the day may combat hypoactive delirium (e.g. adenosine 2 A antagonists, dopamine transporter antagonists, orexin agonists, histamine 3 antagonists).

	- **Circadian interventions**: Melatonergic and other circadian interventions could strengthen the phase or amplitude of circadian rhythms and ensure appropriately entrained timing in patients with or at risk for delirium (e.g. as informed by a person's preexisting circadian phase).

### Clinical practice guidelines for the prevention and management of pain, agitation/sedation, delirium, immobility, and sleep disruption in adult patients in the ICU [^114ACkjw]. Critical Care Medicine (2018). High credibility.

The objective of this study is to update and expand the 2013 clinical practice guidelines for the management of pain, agitation, and delirium in adult patients in the ICU.

- **Design**: Thirty-two international experts, four methodologists, and four critical illness survivors met virtually at least monthly. All section groups gathered face-to-face at annual Society of Critical Care Medicine congresses. Virtual connections were included for those unable to attend. A formal conflict of interest policy was developed a priori and enforced throughout the process. Teleconferences and electronic discussions among subgroups and the whole panel were part of the guidelines' development. A general content review was completed face-to-face by all panel members in January 2017.

- **Methods**: Content experts, methodologists, and ICU survivors were represented in each of the five sections of the guidelines: pain, agitation/sedation, delirium, immobility (mobilization/rehabilitation), and sleep (disruption). Each section created Population, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcome and nonactionable descriptive questions based on perceived clinical relevance. The guideline group then voted on their ranking, and patients prioritized their importance. For each Population, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcome question, sections searched the best available evidence, determined its quality, and formulated recommendations as "strong", "conditional", or "good" practice statements based on Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation principles. Additionally, evidence gaps and clinical caveats were explicitly identified.

### Environmental factors and risk of delirium in geriatric patients: An observational study [^115d8YqN]. BMC Geriatrics (2018). Low credibility.

These associations between environmental factors and delirium are supported by studies showing that non-pharmacological, mainly environmental intervention programs are effective in preventing delirium. Since delirium is common, has poor prognosis, and substantial economic impact, there seems to be a large potential for both health-related and economic benefits through focus on hospital environment and implementation of non-pharmacological delirium intervention programs. Such interventions also seem to have benefits beyond delirium prevention. In addition to a 44% reduction in delirium incidence, a meta-analysis from 2015 reports a 64% reduction in fall rates and a trend towards reduced length of stay and institutionalization rates in the intervention groups.

We found no association between ward-transfers and incident delirium. A possible explanation is that all ward-transfers are done in a predictable way at daytime. Another explanation may be that the geriatric ward provides a multicomponent intervention program against delirium that may outweigh the potentially negative effect of ward-transfers. If so, this effect could also have influenced the associations between the other exposure variables and incident delirium. The lack of association between time spent in the ED and incident delirium might reflect that the ED in our hospital emphasizes initial examination and short stay before transfer to a relevant ward, thereby providing less insult to vulnerable patients than the ED as described by Bo et al.

### The effects of melatonin versus placebo on delirium in hip fracture patients: Study protocol of a randomised, placebo-controlled, double blind trial [^114f3sGT]. BMC Geriatrics (2011). Low credibility.

With an ageing population, older individuals constitute a larger portion of the hospital demographic. The incidence of delirium is notably high in this group, and experiencing delirium has significant short- and long-term consequences, necessitating preventive measures. During episodes of delirium, a disruption in the sleep-wake cycle is commonly observed. Melatonin is instrumental in regulating this cycle, suggesting that alterations in melatonin metabolism may play a critical role in the development of delirium. This article aims to outline the design of a randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial currently underway, investigating the effects of melatonin compared to placebo on delirium in older postoperative hip fracture patients.

- **Methods/design**: Acutely hospitalised patients aged 65 years or older, admitted for surgical repair of hip fracture, are randomised (n = 452) into either a treatment or placebo group. Prophylactic treatment involves oral administration of melatonin (3 mg) at 21:00 hours over five consecutive days. The primary outcome is the incidence of delirium, diagnosed using the Confusion Assessment Method, within eight days of initiating study medication. Secondary outcomes include delirium severity, assessed by the Delirium Rating Scale; duration of delirium; variations in delirium subtypes; differences in total hospital stay length; total dosage of antipsychotics and/or benzodiazepines used during delirium; and in-hospital complications. A twelve-month follow-up visit will assess cognitive function.

### Moderate dose melatonin for the abatement and treatment of delirium in elderly general medical inpatients: Study protocol of a placebo controlled, randomised, double blind trial [^1166f1Eh]. BMC Geriatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Delirium is a frequent, costly, and morbid problem. No agent has been shown to modify the natural history of the condition, and treatments have significant side effects. Prophylactic melatonin in low doses has been shown to prevent delirium from developing. This trial aims to determine the feasibility of assessing if melatonin, at a moderate dose, effectively treats the symptoms of delirium and modifies the natural history, including abating symptoms after treatment cessation.

- **Methods/design**: Elderly patients (≥ 70 years of age) admitted to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with delirium, and not requiring surgery, will be identified from the practice of the investigators and through referral by other general medical unit staff. To facilitate this, other staff will be briefed on the project by investigators. Patients will be recruited with suitable informed and documented consent (person responsible) by the study investigators. They will receive orally either 5 mg melatonin (18 patients) or placebo (18 patients) nightly for 5 nights (or until discharged).

- **Treatment assessment**: During treatment, participants will be assessed by study staff using a validated scale of delirium severity (the Memorial Delirium Assessment Scale) and a validated measure of delirium state (Confusion Assessment Method) to determine if melatonin decreases the severity or the duration of delirium. Assessment will continue for a further two days after treatment has ceased to determine if the treatment causes persisting abatement of symptoms and to assess for adverse events.

### Preventing delirium in an acute hospital using a non-pharmacological intervention [^114Cq14q]. Age and Ageing (2012). Low credibility.

Delirium is a clinical syndrome associated with multiple short and long-term complications; therefore, prevention is an essential part of its management. This study was designed to assess the efficacy of a multicomponent intervention in delirium prevention.

- **Methods**: A total of 287 hospitalized patients at intermediate or high risk of developing delirium were randomized to receive a non-pharmacological intervention delivered by family members (144 patients) or standard management (143 patients). The primary efficacy outcome was the occurrence of delirium at any time during the course of hospitalization. Three validated observers performed the event adjudication using the confusion assessment method screening instrument.

- **Results**: There were no significant differences in the baseline characteristics between the two groups. The primary outcome occurred in 5.6% of the patients in the intervention group and in 13.3% of the patients in the control group (relative risk: 0.41; confidence interval: 0.19–0.92; P = 0.027).

- **Conclusion**: The results of this study show that there is a benefit in the non-pharmacological prevention of delirium using family members compared to the standard management of patients at risk of developing this condition.

### Melatonin for the prevention of postoperative delirium in older adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113PpZqG]. BMC Geriatrics (2019). Low credibility.

Currently, where there is no supported pharmacological intervention to prevent delirium incidence in older surgical patients, this meta-analysis suggests that melatonin may become that first agent. The odds of developing delirium in patients who received melatonin agonists perioperatively were 37% less (p = 0.006) than those who received a placebo or no treatment at all. Although optimal dosing remains an unanswered question, the potential benefits, low cost, and benign side effect profile make melatonin an attractive option to use in older adults undergoing surgical procedures to reduce delirium incidence.

### Core outcome set for studies evaluating interventions to prevent or treat delirium in long-term care older residents: International key stakeholder informed consensus study [^113sm8N1]. Age and Ageing (2024). High credibility.

Delirium is characterized by fluctuating mental status with marked inattention and other cognitive disturbances. In older adults, delirium is associated with serious negative outcomes including neurocognitive disturbance, cognitive decline, decreased functional status, and adverse events such as falls and death. Moderate certainty evidence supports the use of multicomponent interventions to prevent delirium in acute hospital settings, with a reported reduction in the incidence of delirium by 43%. However, there is no evidence for the effectiveness of pharmacological interventions to treat delirium in non-acute hospital settings.

Despite its widespread prevalence and substantial impact on healthcare systems, there is limited evidence for effective prevention, and none for effective treatment, of delirium in older adults in other settings. A review of delirium prevention in long-term care identified only three trials meeting the criteria for inclusion, with only one providing evidence of a reduced incidence of delirium in those who received the intervention.

The lack of consensus on which outcomes to select when conducting trials to evaluate an intervention complicates evidence synthesis necessary for clinical recommendations. A 2019 delirium think tank established the need for core outcome sets (COS) for studies of interventions to prevent and/or treat delirium as a research priority. Core outcome sets are an agreed-upon minimum set of outcomes to be measured and reported in all studies related to a specific health condition.

### Melatonin for the prevention of postoperative delirium in older adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112639Qh]. BMC Geriatrics (2019). Low credibility.

Delirium is characterized by an acute disturbance in attention with an altered level of consciousness or disorganized thinking that is not better explained by a pre-existing neurocognitive or medical condition, substance intoxication or withdrawal, or medication side effect. Patients who develop delirium in the hospital are at a significantly greater risk of other negative outcomes, including the development of dementia, institutionalization, and one-year mortality. One study in postoperative cardiac patients suggested that reduced cognition as a result of postoperative delirium had still not fully recovered, even a year following surgery.

While the incidence of delirium in the hospitalized general medicine population is estimated to be 11–14%, older adults and post-surgical patients are at much greater risk, with an estimated incidence of 20–29% in geriatric medicine patients and 11–51% in surgical patients. Additionally, approximately 56% of hospitalized patients with a history of dementia will develop delirium.

Melatonin is a natural hormone produced by the pineal gland in the brain and is known to be involved in sleep-wake cycle regulation. It has been studied for a variety of uses, including but not limited to insomnia, jet lag, circadian rhythm disorders in the blind, shift work, and more recently, delirium prevention. Recent studies suggest that preoperative cerebrospinal fluid melatonin concentrations may be correlated with delirium risk following hip fracture surgery and that melatonin secretion rapidly declines with age.

### A systematic review of non-pharmacological interventions to improve nighttime sleep among residents of long-term care settings [^111fiXqA]. BMC Geriatrics (2018). Low credibility.

The risks of bias for randomized clinical trials and all other quantitative studies are summarized in tables. Among the 30 RCTs, most studies had a low (n = 11) or unclear (n = 15) risk of selection bias. A majority (n = 28) had a low risk of reporting bias because there was clarity in the reporting of all pre-specified outcomes. Most studies were at low risk for detection (n = 21) and attrition (n = 19) bias. However, only seven studies were deemed at low risk for incomplete outcome data for periods longer than six weeks because most studies only reported data in the immediate post-intervention period. Regarding performance bias, nine studies were at high risk because it was not possible to blind anyone to the intervention.

For the 24 non-RCTs, most (n = 20) studies met at least 12 of the 17 criteria deemed most important for quality appraisal. Many studies, however, did not describe the statistical power of the study (n = 19), mention piloting of the intervention (n = 13), use valid or reliable measures (n = 8), or overstated study conclusions (n = 13). Few studies presented the ethical considerations of the study procedures or intervention (n = 19).

### Sleep and delirium in adults who are critically ill: A contemporary review [^116JZvRc]. Chest (2020). Low credibility.

Sleep is important to health and well-being, and studies in healthy adults have demonstrated that sleep deprivation impacts respiratory, immune, and cognitive function. Historically, because of the nature of critical illness, sleep has not been considered a priority for patient care in the ICU. More recently, research has demonstrated that sleep is markedly abnormal in patients who are critically ill. In addition, there is often disruption of circadian rhythms.

Delirium is a syndrome of acute alteration in mental status that occurs in the setting of contributing factors such as serious illness, medication, and drug or alcohol intoxication or withdrawal. Delirium is a frequent occurrence in critical illness, and research has demonstrated several adverse outcomes associated with delirium, including persistent cognitive impairment and increased mortality. Sleep deprivation and delirium share many common symptoms. The similarity in symptoms between sleep disruption and delirium has prompted experts to draw links between the two and question both the relationship and its direction. In addition, the inclusion of sleep disturbance in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition, in its constellation of symptoms used in diagnosing delirium has increased awareness of the link between sleep and delirium.

This paper will review the literature on sleep in critical illness and the potential mechanisms and pathways that may connect sleep and delirium.

### Non-pharmacologic multicomponent interventions preventing delirium in hospitalized people [^112XBQmC]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2020). High credibility.

Delirium is a common neurobehavioral complication in hospitalized patients, with a high prevalence in various clinical settings. Prevention of delirium is critical due to its frequent occurrence and associated poor outcomes. Our objective was to evaluate the efficacy of multicomponent interventions in preventing incident delirium in hospitalized patients at risk.

- **Design**: Systematic review and meta-analysis.
- **Setting**: Hospital.
- **Participants**: We included a study if it was a randomized controlled trial evaluating the effects of coordinated non-pharmacologic multicomponent interventions in the prevention of delirium.
- **Measurements**: We performed a systematic literature search in PubMed and CENTRAL (PROSPERO: CRD42019138981; last update May 24, 2019). The quality of included studies was assessed using the criteria established by the Cochrane Collaboration. We extracted measured outcomes for delirium incidence, duration of delirium, length of hospital stay, falls during hospital stay, discharge to institutional care, and inpatient mortality.

In total, we screened 1,027 eligible records and included eight studies with 2,105 patients in the review. We found evidence of an effect, namely a reduction, of multicomponent interventions on the incidence of delirium (risk ratio = .53; 95% confidence interval = .41-.69; I² = 0). We detected no clear evidence of an effect for delirium duration, length of hospital stay, accidental falls, and mortality. Subgroup analyses did not result in findings of substantial effect modifiers.
