## Question

explain tingling in polycythemia vera

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about tingling in polycythemia vera, including its mechanism, prevalence, differential diagnosis, and management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how tingling is described in the literature and whether it is a recognized symptom of PV. Then, I should verify the pathophysiology, especially the roles of hyperviscosity, microvascular ischemia, and iron deficiency. Next, I will quantify prevalence and consider confounders. After that, I need to distinguish tingling from related entities like erythromelalgia and aquagenic pruritus. Finally, I will align management with guideline-based strategies and note any caveats or exceptions that could change practice.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entity. Tingling in PV is best characterized as distal paresthesia, often grouped with microvascular symptoms such as erythromelalgia, visual disturbances, and headaches, which are repeatedly cited in PV reviews and guidelines as part of the disease phenotype, indicating that paresthesia is a recognized manifestation rather than an anomaly [^79425700] [^bda30e99] [^03031eac].

> Now, I need to check the mechanism. The dominant mechanism is hyperviscosity from erythrocytosis causing sluggish microcirculatory flow, endothelial dysfunction, and ischemia of small nerve fibers, which produces tingling or paresthesia; this is reinforced by the fact that microvascular symptoms improve with hematocrit control and antiplatelet therapy, supporting a hemorheologic basis [^79425700] [^bda30e99] [^68773a3e].

> Wait, let me verify a potential confounder: iron deficiency. Repeated phlebotomy can worsen iron deficiency, which itself causes neuromuscular symptoms including paresthesia; thus, tingling may reflect both hyperviscosity and iron deficiency, and this dual contribution complicates attribution unless iron status is assessed and managed thoughtfully [^43162484] [^952d5f09].

> I should confirm prevalence. In a cohort of 117 MPN patients, tingling was endorsed by 16.8% overall and was significantly more frequent in PV than in other MPNs, suggesting a real disease-specific signal; however, this is a single-center, cross-sectional study, so I should be cautious about overgeneralizing and note that larger cohorts emphasize pruritus and erythromelalgia more than isolated paresthesia, which may reflect ascertainment differences [^524fe6e2] [^79425700].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about etiology without distinguishing overlapping entities. Erythromelalgia presents with burning pain and erythema of distal extremities and is a classic microvascular manifestation of PV, whereas aquagenic pruritus is an itch or stinging/burning sensation triggered by water; tingling is more nonspecific and may coexist with or be distinct from these, so I need to ask about triggers, visible changes, and pain quality to separate them at the bedside [^79425700] [^89033294] [^bbc80508].

> Next, I should review management that targets the mechanism. Universal therapy includes therapeutic phlebotomy to maintain hematocrit less than 45% and low-dose aspirin to mitigate platelet activation and microvascular ischemia; these measures reduce thrombotic risk and often alleviate microvascular symptoms, including paresthesias, when hyperviscosity is the driver [^79425700] [^8e426a71] [^6bb28eb7].

> I need to ensure I address iron deficiency when present. If iron deficiency is contributing to paresthesia, cautious iron repletion can be considered, but I should double-check counts because iron replacement can exacerbate erythrocytosis and increase phlebotomy needs; in such cases, guidelines advise balancing symptom relief against hematocrit control and considering cytoreduction if iron therapy destabilizes hematocrit [^43162484] [^d4d94283].

> Let me consider cytoreductive therapy for persistent symptoms. In high-risk patients or in low-risk patients with refractory symptoms or poor hematocrit control, hydroxyurea or interferon are recommended; interferon may be particularly helpful for pruritus and some microvascular symptoms, and ropeginterferon has supportive randomized data showing sustained hematologic and symptom benefits, though I should confirm that paresthesia-specific outcomes are limited and inferential [^627f60a4] [^08faede6] [^f772d390].

> But wait, what if tingling persists despite optimal hematocrit and antiplatelet therapy and iron repletion is not feasible or does not help? I should reconsider alternative diagnoses such as peripheral neuropathy from other causes, medication effects, or compressive etiologies, and I may trial symptom-directed agents like gabapentin or pregabalin for neuropathic paresthesia, recognizing that this is extrapolated from pruritus management guidance and not PV-specific evidence [^afe2cede].

> In summary, tingling in PV reflects microvascular ischemia from hyperviscosity, with possible contributions from iron deficiency; it is a recognized but less specific symptom than erythromelalgia or aquagenic pruritus, improves with hematocrit control and antiplatelet therapy, and warrants assessment of iron status and escalation to cytoreduction if symptoms persist or hematocrit remains uncontrolled, with vigilance for alternative etiologies if refractory [^79425700] [^bda30e99] [^43162484].

---

Tingling in polycythemia vera (PV) is most often due to **hyperviscosity-related microvascular ischemia** [^79425700] of peripheral nerves, causing distal paresthesias, especially in the hands and feet [^bda30e99]. This reflects **sluggish capillary flow** from elevated hematocrit and is typically accompanied by other microvascular symptoms such as erythromelalgia, headaches, and visual disturbances [^68773a3e]. Tingling may also arise from **iron deficiency neuropathy** due to repeated phlebotomy [^43162484], and less commonly from JAK2-driven neuropathic changes or thrombotic complications [^notfound]. Management centers on **phlebotomy to maintain hematocrit < 45%** [^79425700], low-dose aspirin [^8e426a71], and cytoreduction if symptoms persist or risk is high [^f772d390]; iron repletion is used cautiously only when clearly indicated, as it can worsen erythrocytosis [^d4d94283].

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms

Several **interconnected mechanisms** underlie tingling in PV:

- **Hyperviscosity and microvascular ischemia**: Elevated hematocrit increases blood viscosity, impairs microcirculatory flow, and causes ischemia of peripheral nerves, leading to paresthesias [^bda30e99].

- **Iron deficiency neuropathy**: Repeated phlebotomy can cause iron deficiency, contributing to neuropathic symptoms including tingling [^43162484].

- **JAK2 mutation-related neuropathic changes**: Constitutive JAK2 signaling may directly affect neuronal function, though this is less well established.

- **Thrombotic complications**: Microthrombi can cause focal ischemia and tingling, though this is less common.

---

## Clinical presentation and associated symptoms

Tingling in PV typically presents as **distal paresthesias** in the hands and feet, often coexisting with other microvascular symptoms:

| **Symptom** | **Frequency** |
|-|-|
| Erythromelalgia (burning pain, redness) | 5–20% [^notfound] |
| Headaches | 14% [^79425700] |
| Visual disturbances | 14% [^79425700] |
| Pruritus (aquagenic) | 33–69% [^89033294] |
| Fatigue | Common [^79425700] |

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

When evaluating tingling in PV, consider:

- **Confirm PV diagnosis**: Document erythrocytosis, low EPO, and JAK2 mutation [^0cf93e50].

- **Assess iron status**: Ferritin, transferrin saturation, and MCV to evaluate for iron deficiency [^43162484].

- **Exclude other causes**: Rule out diabetic neuropathy, vitamin B12 deficiency, and other peripheral neuropathies.

- **Neurological assessment**: Perform a focused exam to localize and characterize the neuropathy.

---

## Management strategies

Effective management targets both **hematologic control** and **symptom relief**:

- **Phlebotomy**: Maintain hematocrit < 45% to reduce viscosity and improve microcirculation [^79425700].

- **Low-dose aspirin**: 75–100 mg daily to reduce thrombotic risk and improve microvascular symptoms [^8e426a71].

- **Cytoreductive therapy**: Hydroxyurea or interferon for high-risk patients or persistent symptoms [^627f60a4].

- **Iron supplementation**: Use cautiously only if iron deficiency is documented and hematocrit is closely monitored [^d4d94283].

- **Adjunctive therapies**: Gabapentin or pregabalin may help neuropathic symptoms in refractory cases [^afe2cede].

---

## Prognostic implications

Tingling itself is not an independent prognostic marker, but its presence signals active microvascular disease and may correlate with **increased thrombotic risk** if hematocrit remains uncontrolled [^68773a3e]. Persistent tingling despite therapy should prompt reassessment of hematocrit control and consideration of cytoreduction [^3ff29592].

---

Tingling in PV is primarily due to **hyperviscosity-related microvascular ischemia**, with contributions from iron deficiency and possibly JAK2-driven neuropathic changes. It is a common, often early manifestation that responds to hematocrit control, antiplatelet therapy, and judicious cytoreduction, with iron repletion reserved for documented deficiency.

Polycythemia vera (PV) is an orphan haematological disease and one of the most common myeloproliferative diseases, with the incidence rate of about 0.4–2.8 cases per 100000 population per year. In patients, proliferation of all three haematopoietic lineages is observed, typically with the development of erythrocytosis. As a rule, PV occurs in patients aged 60–70 years, slightly more often in men. The main clinical signs of PV are weakness, significant burning sensation in fingers and palms due to the increased blood viscosity and microcirculation disorders, discomfort in the left hypochondrium due to splenomegaly at the background of extramedullary haematopoietic sites development, as well as gross vascular complications (thrombosis) of various localisation. Our clinical case represents a rare cardiac manifestation of the PV in a young man.

### Omalizumab alleviates pruritus in myeloproliferative neoplasms [^89033294]. Haematologica (2023). Medium credibility.

Chronic pruritus is common in patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN), particularly in polycythemia vera (PV). Pruritus is typically of aquagenic character, where an intense pruritus is evoked by skin contact with water, but may also include a stinging, burning, or tingling sensation. In contrast to urticarial disease, aquagenic pruritus is typically not associated with visible skin changes. It is most commonly localized centrally on the body: thorax, abdomen, back and proximal extremities. Pruritus in MPN may also be more generalized and be triggered by other factors than water contact. Pruritus is prevalent in PV, where 31–69% of patients suffer from chronic pruritus, and 15% report aquagenic pruritus of unbearable intensity. Pruritus also occurs in other subtypes of MPN but the prevalence and severity is not as well characterized. Chronic pruritus in MPN may result in a substantially compromised quality of life and lead to anxiety and depressive symptoms, as well as water-avoiding behaviors with negative effects on personal hygiene and social interaction.

Several treatment options have been reported to alleviate MPN-related pruritus, including hydroxyurea, interferons, ruxolitinib, normalization of hematocrit by venesection, antihistamines, SSRI (paroxetine and fluoxetine), narrowband UV-B light, psoralen UV-A light (PUVA), and alkalization of bathing water. Interferons are described to have better effect against pruritus than hydroxyurea with a reported efficacy of 81%.JAK2 inhibition with ruxolitinib has also been reported to reduce pruritus. Interestingly, SSRI has been shown to alleviate symptoms in eight of ten described patients. Despite numerous alternatives, MPN-related pruritis refractory to current treatments remains a clinical challenge. In addition, pruritus may occur in younger individuals with low risk of thrombosis, where cytoreduction is not otherwise indicated, or in patients with intolerance to available cytoreductive therapies. Therefore, there is a great clinical need to find novel approaches to alleviate refractory MPN-related pruritus.

### Aquagenic pruritus in polycythemia vera: characteristics and influence on quality of life in 441 patients [^bbc80508]. American Journal of Hematology (2013). Low credibility.

Aquagenic pruritus (AP) is a symptom typical for polycythemia vera, but very little is known about its exact frequency, characteristics, influence on quality of life, and proper treatment. Therefore, we investigated these aspects in a large cohort of German patients with polycythemia vera using a patient directed questionnaire. Our analysis revealed that 301 of 441 analyzed patients suffered from AP. In 64.8%, AP occurred on average 2.9 years prior to diagnosis of polycythemia vera. Only in 15.4% did this lead to a hematological investigation. AP occurs primarily on the trunk and proximal parts of the extremities. Most patients complain about itching (71.8%), the remainder about tickling, stinging, or burning sensations. Forty-four patients (14.6%) classified the pruritus as "unbearable". Patients with AP reported reduced global health status and higher fatigue, pain, and dyspnea. Only 24% of patients received pruritus specific treatment for pruritus consisting mostly of histamine antagonists, which ameliorated symptoms in about half of the patients. In 5.6% of patients, polycythemia vera directed therapy (phlebotomy/cytoreduction) resolved the symptoms. In summary, AP is a serious symptom in patients with polycythemia vera, which until recently was difficult to treat. The advent of the novel JAK2 inhibitors, however, may open new ways for therapy.

### Prevalence of physical problems detected by the distress thermometer and problem list in patients with myeloproliferative disorders [^524fe6e2]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2017). Low credibility.

Background: Patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) can have a severe physical symptom burden over an extended disease trajectory that contributes to decreased quality of life. Few studies, however, have characterized which patients most frequently consider physical symptoms a problem. This study describes the physical symptoms of patients with MPNs and the relationship of these symptoms to patient characteristics. Methods: Patients with MPNs (N = 117) completed questionnaires in a dedicated academic medical center MPN clinic. Patients reported demographics (age, race/ethnicity, sex, marital status, employment status), disease characteristics (MPN type, time with MPN), and whether they were bothered by any of 22 variables in the "Physical Problems" list in the Distress Thermometer and Problem List (DT&PL). Results: The median number of physical problems endorsed by patients was 2 (median, 2.26; SD, 3.18), with a range from 0 to 20. Two-fifths endorsed no physical problems, one-fifth endorsed 1 problem, and two-fifths endorsed ≥ 2 problems, with fatigue (35.5%), sleep (27.1%), pain (21.5%), dry skin/pruritus (18.7%), and memory/concentration (16.8%) being the most commonly reported. Non-Caucasian participants reported more problems with sleep (P = 0.050), pain (P = 0.016), and tingling (P = 0.026). Patients with polycythemia vera (PV) reported more issues with tingling (P = 0.046) and sexual problems (P = 0.032). Conclusions: Patients with MPNs are more likely to report physical symptom bother than to report no bother with multiple physical problems on the DT&PL. Patients of minority race/ethnicity and those with PV, however, showed heightened prevalence of physical problems-characteristics which may be used to triage patients for more intensive symptom management.

### Polycythemia vera treatment algorithm 2018 [^bda30e99]. Blood Cancer Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Polycythemia vera (PV) is currently classified by the World Health Organization (WHO) classification system under the major category of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN). Although the WHO MPN category includes seven subcategories, the term "MPN" usually refers to the three JAK2 mutation-enriched clinicopathologic entities: PV, essential thrombocythemia (ET) and primary myelofibrosis (PMF). PV and its sister diseases constitute stem cell-derived clonal myeloproliferation that is characterized by three mutually-exclusive "driver" mutations: JAK2, CALR, and MPL, with respective distribution frequency of ~99, 0, and 0% for PV, 55, 22, and 3% for ET and 65, 20 and 7% for PMF. The most frequent MPN-associated JAK2 mutation is the exon 14 JAK2 V617F, which is responsible for almost all the JAK2 mutations in ET and PMF, and 97% of those seen in PV; the remainder 3% of JAK2 mutations in PV are spread across exons 12, 13, and 14.

Diagnosis of PV often requires the presence of a JAK2 mutation, in addition to documentation of increased hemoglobin/hematocrit, to a threshold level established by the 2016 World Health Organization (WHO) revised criteria (> 16.5 g/dL/49% for males and > 16 g/dL/48% for females). In addition, bone marrow morphologic assessment is encouraged, in order to distinguish PV from JAK2 -mutated ET - and obtain cytogenetic information, which has recently been shown to be prognostically relevant –. Clinical features in PV include mild-to-moderate degree of splenomegaly, mild-to-moderate degree of constitutional symptoms, including fatigue and pruritus, symptoms of hyperviscosity, leukocytosis, thrombocytosis, microvascular symptoms (e.g. headaches, lightheadedness, visual disturbances, atypical chest pain, erythromelalgia, paresthesia), thrombotic and bleeding complications, and risk of leukemic transformation or fibrotic progression.

### Polycythemia vera: an appraisal of the biology and management 10 years after the discovery of JAK2 V617F [^03031eac]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2015). Low credibility.

The disease polycythemia vera can be associated with DVT, night sweats, ↑ RBCs, generalized pruritus, ↓ serum EPO, ↑ hematocrit, nosebleed, erythromelalgia, central vein thrombosis, iron deficiency, tinnitus, bone pain, gastrointestinal bleeding, VTE, ICH, easy bruising, paresthesia, ↑ blood hemoglobin, ashkenazi Jews, gout, skin erythema, fever, digital ischemia, difficulty concentrating, abdominal discomfort, ↑ platelet count, fatigue, sweating, visual disturbances, ↑ blood neutrophil count, JAK2 gene mutation, superficial vein thrombosis, splenomegaly, chest pain, TIA, weight loss, stroke, dizziness, blurred vision, splanchnic vein thrombosis, early satiety, abdominal pain, headache, hypertension, aquagenic pruritus, confusion and acquired vWD.

### Cyanotic congenital heart disease (CCHD) with symptomatic erythrocytosis [^40080130]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Secondary erythrocytosis of cyanotic congenital heart disease (CCHD) is pathologically different from primary erythrocytosis of polycythemia vera (PV). An association between elevated hematocrit and thrombosis has been established in PV patients, and treatment guidelines recommend maintaining hematocrit < 45%. Although an association between elevated hematocrit and thrombosis has not been established in CCHD and secondary erythrocytosis, the current clinical practice is to phlebotomize these patients to hematocrit < 65%. We report a 21-year-old woman with CCHD who presented with symptomatic erythrocytosis with numbness and tingling with hemoglobin 25.2 g/dl and hematocrit 75.8%. Her symptoms resolved with IV hydration. Other factors, including dehydration and iron deficiency, may precipitate hyperviscosity symptoms. The treatment is volume replacement and low-dose iron therapy, not phlebotomy. Repeated phlebotomy causes iron deficiency with microcytic erythrocytes, which increases the whole blood viscosity and, therefore, can potentially accentuate rather than decrease the risk for a cerebrovascular accident.

### Polycythemia vera: historical oversights, diagnostic details, and therapeutic views [^93817c5b]. Leukemia (2021). Medium credibility.

Management of pruritus

Pruritus is a particularly vexing symptom associated with PV and is often exacerbated by contact with water. In a large cohort of 441 German patients with PV, patient-directed questionnaire revealed that 68% of the patients were affected by aquagenic pruritus, in the majority occurring before formal diagnosis of PV; pruritus manifested in different forms including itching, tickling, stinging, or burning sensations and its severity was labeled unbearable in 15% of the cases. In a review of the literature spanning the period 1965–2009, application of a variety of treatment modalities, including antihistamines, antidepressants, IFN-α, phlebotomy, phototherapy, iron supplements, and myelosuppressive medications, was documented with mixed efficacy results. In the low-risk disease setting, we first consider non-drug measures, such as avoidance of precipitating conditions, dry skin, and temperature control of one's environment and water used for bathing. In general, treatment responses to antihistamines have been both unpredictable and variable. More favorable responses have been reported with use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and narrow-band ultraviolet B phototherapy. In high-risk disease setting, both JAK2 inhibitors and IFN-a have shown therapeutic activity, which is not shared by HU.

### Impact of ELN clinical signs and symptoms on the thrombotic risk in polycythemia vera patients treated with front-line hydroxyurea [^68773a3e]. Leukemia (2025). Medium credibility.

In absence of a unified definition of "relevant" CVRF, the ANOVA test was used to identify the combination of CVRFs most strongly correlated with the risk of thrombosis. Five predefined CVRFs, namely active smoking, hypertension, overweight (BMI ≥ 25), diabetes, and dyslipidemia, were included in the analysis.

In summary, CSSs were defined as follows: (1) persistent/progressive leukocytosis: 100% increase if white blood cells (WBC) < 10 × 10 9 /L or 50% increase if WBC ≥ 10, or WBC > 15 × 10 9 /L before HU start; (2) extreme thrombocytosis: PLT > 1000 × 10 9 /L at HU start; (3) progressive splenomegaly: increase by more than 5 cm below costal margin (BCM) in the year before HU start; (4) inadequate HCT control: ≥ 6 PHLs/year or HCT ≥ 50% at two evaluations within 1 year before HU start or PHL intolerance; (5) "relevant" CVRFs: co-occurrence of active smoking, hypertension and overweight (with or without the presence of diabetes and/or dyslipidemia); (6) severe itching.

In patients at low thrombotic risk who did not receive cytoreduction during follow-up, the presence of CSSs was assessed at least 2 years after diagnosis to ensure the most accurate assessment of the criteria for inadequate hematocrit control.

The presence and severity of itching at the start of HU were assessed during clinical visits. In recent years, the 10-item Myeloproliferative Neoplasm Symptom Assessment Form Total Symptom Score (MPN10-TSS) has been used and "severe" itching was considered with a score ≥ 5 according to ELN definition. Alternatively, the itching score was considered ≥ 5 if refractory to specific medication (e.g. antihistamines).

Additional reasons to start hydroxyurea were defined as follows: spleen palpable at 2–5 cm below costal margin, mild leukocytosis or thrombocytosis (WBC > 11 × 10 9 /L or PLT > 450 × 10 9 /L but not meeting the definition of persistent/progressive or extreme), presence of microvascular disturbances despite appropriate phlebotomies and antiplatelet drug therapy (including vascular headaches, dizziness, visual disturbances, burning pain sensation in the palms of the hands and soles of the feet, distal paresthesia and acrocyanosis), ≥ 3 PHLs in the 12 months before HU start.

### Dysregulated iron metabolism in polycythemia vera: etiology and consequences [^43162484]. Leukemia (2018). Low credibility.

Iron metabolism in polycythemia vera

Because anemia is the best recognized indicator of iron deficiency, the diagnosis of iron deficiency in the context of PV, and thus without anemia, requires the identification of ferritin, transferrin saturation, and MCV below the lower limit of normal. In addition, symptoms associated with iron deficiency, including fatigue, global weakness, and neuromuscular disturbances, may overlap with those of PV such that attributing symptoms to a single underlying cause may be challenging. Furthermore, glossitis, cheilosis, koilonychias, restless leg syndrome, and Pica have all been reported in PV patients, and support the diagnosis of iron deficiency in this context. Decisions regarding the management of iron deficiency in PV are complex. On one hand, it is compelling to attempt symptom relief with iron supplementation and, on the other hand, attaining iron deficiency is an intended consequence of therapeutic phlebotomy which limits the degree of erythrocytosis. Although symptoms of iron deficiency rarely result in discontinuing therapeutic phlebotomy, initiating cytoreductive therapy may be warranted to enable HCT control with less intensive phlebotomy especially since iron supplementation often leads to worsening of erythrocytosis, requiring an increase in the frequency of phlebotomies and/or the institution of cytoreductive therapy.

### Upadacitinib as a treatment for chronic pruritus secondary to polycythemia vera after failure with dupilumab [^7cbadc98]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

CP, characterized by itching lasting for > 6 weeks, may be organized into the following 4 categories: dermatologic, systemic, neuropathic, and/or psychogenic causes. PCV is a myeloproliferative disorder due to a janus kinase (JAK) 2 mutation, which is associated with increased hematocrit levels. This case demonstrates the successful use of upadacitinib in treating CP secondary to PCV.

Pruritus is a symptom that is classically associated with PCV. In a study assessing the prevalence of pruritus in patients with PCV, 17% of the 397 patients required specific treatment of the PCV-associated itching. Although pruritus in patients with PCV is often exacerbated by skin contact with water (eg, showers and baths), our patient denied worsening pruritus in these settings. The recommended screening tests for CP of unknown origin were negative in our patient. In this case, the previous diagnosis of PCV suggested a systemic etiological cause of CP.

### Combination therapy with ruxolitinib and pegylated interferon alfa-2a in newly diagnosed patients with polycythemia vera [^2e12afdf]. Blood Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

The prevalence of all AEs, including disease-related and study drug-unrelated events, observed in ≥ 10% of the patients and all grade 3 to 4 AEs are presented in Table 2. The AEs routinely asked for are reported in "Methods". Only a few grade 3 to 4 events were observed. Of note, 1 thromboembolic event, a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction, occurred during the study. The patient had PBCR at the time. Only 1 patient had a grade 3 infection, which included pneumonia and an upper airway infection which required intravenous antibiotics. Shortly thereafter the patient dropped out due to progression to post-PV myelofibrosis. Grade 1 depressive symptoms were reported in 9 (36%) and grade 2 in 4 (16%) of patients; however, no clinical depression was diagnosed, and no psychiatric treatment was needed. These symptoms were mostly intermittent. No patients had to discontinue treatment due to psychiatric symptoms. Grade 1 to 2 anemia was frequent and handled by dose adjustment (Table 2; Figure 1). Notably, 17 patients (68%) grade reported grade 1 to 2 sensory neuropathy at any time point; 9 of these reported the symptom at 3 or fewer time points without symptoms at the final evaluation.

Patient–reported quality-of-life outcomes

During the 2 years of treatment, we observed a reduction in TSS from baseline; however, this was only significant at 2 of the visits: 14 days and 21 months (Figure 2). The following items of the TSS were significantly reduced at more than half of the time points, compared with baseline: abdominal discomfort (P < .001), night sweats (P < .001), itching (P < .05), and bone pain (P < .001). None of the items increased significantly during the study (supplemental Figure 3).

Materials and methods

Study population

This retrospective study was approved by the Institutional review board by the Local Ethics Committee at University of Florence and Policlinico Gemelli, Catholic University, Rome. The study was conducted in accordance with the ethical guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki. Study patients were selected from respective institutional databases provided they were confirmed according to the 2016 WHO criteria for PV diagnosis and written, informed consent was obtained from all living subjects; treatment approaches were in accordance with standard of care at the time of initial diagnosis. Diagnostic criteria for leukemic and myelofibrotic transformation were revised according to the 2016 WHO classification and international working group for MPN research and treatment (IWG-MRT) criteria, respectively. JAK2 exon 12 mutated PV patients were excluded, and all patients were annotated for JAK2 V617F VAF, determined within 3 years from diagnosis, according to previous published methods. Bone marrow biopsies were internally reviewed to adhere to current criteria and in those without an evaluable bone marrow histology, PV diagnosis relied on the presence of both elevated hemoglobin levels (i.e. > 16.5/16.0 g/dl in males and females, respectively), presence of JAK2 V617F mutation and low serum erythropoietin, according to the latest WHO criteria. Arterial thrombosis included ischemic stroke, transient ischemic attack, retinal artery occlusion, coronary arterial disease, and peripheral arterial disease, whereas venous thrombosis included cerebral venous thrombosis, deep vein thrombosis of the limbs, pulmonary embolism and superficial vein thrombosis. All reported thrombotic events were objectively identified by imaging, serological biomarkers and/or electrocardiogram. Thrombotic events were considered as post diagnosis if occurring at least 4 weeks after PV diagnosis whereas thrombotic events before diagnosis included all events that occurred at any time prior to diagnosis. Microcirculatory symptoms included dizziness, headaches, visual disturbances, erythromelalgia, distal paresthesia and acrocyanosis. Major bleedings were defined based on International Society on Thrombosis and Hemostasis (ISTH) definition as: gastrointestinal, internal organ, intraarticular, cerebrovascular, retroperitoneal bleed or any bleeding requiring medical and/or surgical intervention, hospitalization and/or resulting in death.

### Dysregulated iron metabolism in polycythemia vera: etiology and consequences [^952d5f09]. Leukemia (2018). Low credibility.

In total, the target HCT goal of < 45% is associated with a decrease in cardiovascular complications. However, controlling HCT has not been clearly shown to decrease symptom burden or the risk of disease progression. In fact, repeated phlebotomy may exacerbate iron deficiency-related symptoms and has been associated with worsening of disease-related symptoms such as pruritus. Furthermore, a high phlebotomy requirement (> 4 per year) is associated with increased risk of thrombosis, but whether this is due to worsening iron deficiency, other consequences of phlebotomy, or to the underlying disease remains poorly understood. High phlebotomy requirements often indicate the need for initiating cytoreductive therapy which may reverse symptoms of iron deficiency possibly by decreasing the frequency of phlebotomy.

### Diagnosis and treatment of polycythemia vera: a review [^79425700]. JAMA (2025). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Polycythemia vera (PV), a myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by an increased red blood cell mass and increased risk of thrombosis, affects approximately 65 000 people in the US, with an annual incidence of 0.5 to 4.0 cases per 100 000 persons.

Observations

Erythrocytosis (hemoglobin > 16.5 mg/dL in men or > 16.0 mg/dL in women) is a required diagnostic criterion, although thrombocytosis (53%) and leukocytosis (49%) are common. Patients may have pruritus (33%), erythromelalgia (5.3%), transient visual changes (14%), and splenomegaly (36%) with abdominal discomfort. More than 95% of patients have a JAK2 gene variant, which helps distinguish PV from secondary causes of erythrocytosis, such as tobacco smoking or sleep apnea. Among 7 cohorts (1545 individuals), the median survival from diagnosis was 14.1 to 27.6 years. Prior to or at the time of PV diagnosis, arterial thrombosis occurred in 16% of patients and 7% had venous thrombotic events, which could involve unusual sites, such as splanchnic veins. PV is also associated with an increased bleeding risk, especially in patients with acquired von Willebrand disease, which can occur with extreme thrombocytosis (platelet count, ≥ 1000×109/L). All patients with PV should receive therapeutic phlebotomy (goal hematocrit, < 45%) and low-dose aspirin (if no contraindications). Patients who are at higher risk of thrombosis include those aged 60 years or older or with a prior thrombosis. These patients and those with persistent PV symptoms may benefit from cytoreductive therapy with hydroxyurea or interferon to lower thrombosis risk and decrease symptoms. Ruxolitinib is a Janus kinase inhibitor that can alleviate pruritus and decrease splenomegaly in patients who are intolerant of or resistant to hydroxyurea. About 12.7% of patients with PV develop myelofibrosis and 6.8% develop acute myeloid leukemia.

Conclusions and Relevance

PV is a myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by erythrocytosis and is almost universally associated with a JAK2 gene variant. PV is associated with an increased risk of arterial and venous thrombosis, hemorrhage, myelofibrosis, and acute myeloid leukemia. To decrease the risk of thrombosis, all patients with PV should be treated with aspirin and therapeutic phlebotomy to maintain a hematocrit of less than 45%. Cytoreductive therapies, such as hydroxyurea or interferon, are recommended for patients at high risk of thrombosis.

Polycythaemia vera is a challenging disease to study given its low prevalence and prolonged time-to-event for important clinical endpoints such as thrombosis, progression, and mortality. Although researchers in this space often rise to meet these challenges, there is considerable room for improvement in the analysis of retrospective data, the development of risk-stratification tools, and the design of randomised controlled trials. In this Viewpoint, we review the evidence behind the contemporary approach to risk stratification and treatment of polycythaemia vera. Frameworks for using data more efficiently, constructing more nuanced prognostic models, and overcoming challenges in clinical trial design are discussed.

Myeloproliferative neoplasms

The myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) are a group of diseases in which there is an increased proliferation of one or more subtypes of myeloid cells. Those associated with stroke are polycythemia vera (PV) and essential thrombocythemia (ET). The Janus kinase JAK2 exon 14 V617F mutation is present in more than 95% of patients with PV and in approximately 50% of those with ET. Other mutually exclusive driver mutations are found in the genes MPL, CALR, and JAK2 exon 12. The incidence of MPN increases exponentially after the age of 60. MPN are chronic diseases with years of survival, estimated at 14 years for PV and 20 years for ET.

Thrombotic complications are frequent in MPN. A recent large study found that the 5-year risk of vascular disease ranged from 0.5 to 7.7% in patients with MPNs, with adjusted HRs which were 1.3–3.7-fold higher than in the general population Stroke can be the first clinical manifestation of an underlying MPN. In the National Inpatient Sample, a total of 552,422 hospitalizations involved patients with a diagnosis of ET, 20,650 of which were due to stroke (0.04%). Clinical hints suggesting MPN as the cause of stroke are multiple or recurrent territorial infarcts, often with large vessel occlusion. Transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) in the context of MPN are usually multiple and may be typical or atypical (isolated dysarthria, diplopia or unsteadiness, hearing loss, transient focal deficits with prominent headache, and very brief or sequential deficits). Erythromelalgia (a burning or painful sensation of the fingers, palms, and sometimes also of the toes and soles accompanied by a red-cyanotic skin discoloration of the affected areas) and splenomegaly are suggestive systemic findings. World Health Organization 2016 diagnostic laboratory criteria for PV require sustained (> 1 month) increased hemoglobin or hematocrit values (hemoglobin > 16.5 g/dL in men, > 16.0 g/dL in women; hematocrit > 49% in men, > 48% in women) with subnormal erythropoietin levels and the absence of a secondary cause of erythrocytosis. ET sustained high platelet counts (> 450,000/µL) (> 1 month) in the absence of a secondary cause of thrombocytosis. The JAK2 V617F mutation is present in the majority of stroke patients. In half of the patients, there is an additional stroke risk factor, such as atherosclerosis, dissection, or atrial fibrillation. Female gender, atrial fibrillation, stroke, higher comorbidity score, and age 80 or more are independent predictors of mortality in stroke associated with ET.

### Polycythemia vera: historical oversights, diagnostic details, and therapeutic views [^e665d3d6]. Leukemia (2021). Medium credibility.

Polycythemia vera (PV) is a relatively indolent myeloid neoplasm with median survival that exceeds 35 years in young patients, but its natural history might be interrupted by thrombotic, fibrotic, or leukemic events, with respective 20-year rates of 26%, 16%, and 4%. Current treatment strategies in PV have not been shown to prolong survival or lessen the risk of leukemic or fibrotic progression and instead are directed at preventing thrombotic complications. In the latter regard, two risk categories are considered: high (age > 60 years or thrombosis history) and low (absence of both risk factors). All patients require phlebotomy to keep hematocrit below 45% and once-daily low-dose aspirin, in the absence of contraindications. Cytoreductive therapy is recommended for high-risk or symptomatic low-risk disease; our first-line drug of choice in this regard is hydroxyurea but we consider pegylated interferon as an alternative in certain situations, including in young women of reproductive age, in patients manifesting intolerance or resistance to hydroxyurea therapy, and in situations where treatment is indicated for curbing phlebotomy requirement rather than preventing thrombosis. Additional treatment options include busulfan and ruxolitinib; the former is preferred in older patients and the latter in the presence of symptoms reminiscent of post-PV myelofibrosis or protracted pruritus. Our drug choices reflect our appreciation for long-term track record of safety, evidence for reduction of thrombosis risk, and broader suppression of myeloproliferation. Controlled studies are needed to clarify the added value of twice- vs once-daily aspirin dosing and direct oral anticoagulants. In this invited review, we discuss our current approach to diagnosis, prognostication, and treatment of PV in general, as well as during specific situations, including pregnancy and splanchnic vein thrombosis.

### Upadacitinib as a treatment for chronic pruritus secondary to polycythemia vera after failure with dupilumab [^e27d804a]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic pruritus (CP) is defined as an itching sensation lasting for > 6 weeks. It can considerably negatively impact quality of life to degrees comparable with chronic pain. The prevalence of CP in the United States has not been well established; however, pruritus has been found to result in at least 7 million ambulatory care visits in the United States. Due to the complex and multifactorial mechanism of CP, it may be difficult to treat. There are no Food and Drug Administration–approved treatments specifically for CP. Here, we report the case of CP due to polycythemia vera (PCV) that initially improved but ultimately failed when treated with dupilumab, which later successfully responded to upadacitinib.

Polycythaemia vera (PV) is a Philadelphia‐negative myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) characterized by primary erythrocytosis and deregulated Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription signalling (Vannucchi, 2014). Most patients with PV experience a broad symptom burden that may include fatigue/tiredness, itching, muscle aches and sweating (Emanuel et al, 2012; Vannucchi et al, 2015). The biomolecular underpinnings of PV‐related symptoms have not been fully elucidated. However, elevated serum inflammatory cytokine levels have been reported in MPN patients (Barbui et al, 2011; Vaidya et al, 2012; Pourcelot et al, 2014) and may contribute to the severity of symptoms, including itching and night sweats (Tefferi et al, 2011; Squires et al, 2013). Other common aspects of the PV disease state, including blood hyperviscosity (Barbui et al, 2013) and splenomegaly (Mesa et al, 2007), may also play a role in the symptom profile of some patients. The overall PV‐related symptom burden, as measured by the MPN Symptom Assessment Form total symptom score (MPN‐SAF TSS), as well as the severity of individual symptoms, including fatigue (Emanuel et al, 2012; Abelsson et al, 2013) and itching (Siegel et al, 2013), have been associated with reduced quality of life in patients with PV.

Discussion

This report of the RELIEF trial primary results indicates that for patients with generally well‐controlled PV receiving a stable dose of HC, a change in treatment to ruxolitinib monotherapy was associated with a positive trend in symptom improvement compared with those continuing on HC, although this trend was not statistically significant. At Week 16, median changes from baseline in all individual TSS‐C symptom scores favoured ruxolitinib and were still improving at Week 48. Itching was the symptom with the most pronounced improvements observed with ruxolitinib at Week 16. Patients who crossed over to ruxolitinib after randomization to HC experienced improvements in all individual TSS‐C symptom scores within 8 weeks of ruxolitinib treatment; symptom scores stabilised or continued to improve with 48 weeks of treatment. However, data on long‐term and crossover treatment with ruxolitinib were limited by small patient populations. Patient‐reported improvements in symptom severity were better with ruxolitinib compared with HC; a greater proportion of patients receiving ruxolitinib reported that their symptoms were "very much improved" or "much improved".

### JAK inhibitors for myeloproliferative neoplasms: clarifying facts from myths [^e9a6ed23]. Blood (2012). Low credibility.

On November 16, 2011, the Food and Drug Administration approved ruxolitinib (a JAK1 and JAK2 inhibitor) for use in the treatment of high and intermediate risk myelofibrosis. This is welcome news for those patients in whom such therapy is indicated and treatment benefit outweighs attendant risk. The question is who are these patients, what should they expect in terms of both short-term effects and long-term impact, and why would they choose ruxolitinib over other JAK inhibitors that are freely available for use in a research setting. Ruxolitinib and most other JAK inhibitors exert a salutary effect on constitutional symptoms and splenomegaly but have yet to produce histopathologic or cytogenetic remissions, reverse bone marrow fibrosis, or improve survival over best supportive care. Furthermore, the palliative value of JAK inhibitors is diminished by notable side effects, including anemia, thrombocytopenia, gastrointestinal disturbances, metabolic abnormalities, peripheral neuropathy, and hyperacute relapse of symptoms during treatment discontinuation. Therefore, risk-benefit balance favors use of currently available JAK inhibitors in only a select group of patients with myelofibrosis, and their potential value in polycythemia vera, outside of special circumstances (eg, intractable pruritus), is undermined by the absence of evidence for a disease-modifying effect and presence of arguably superior alternatives.

### Risk factors for arterial versus venous thrombosis in polycythemia vera: a single center experience in 587 patients [^adebb2d8]. Blood Cancer Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Polycythemia vera (PV) is a myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) characterized by clonal erythrocytosis resulting from constitutive activation of the Janus Kinase and Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription (JAK-STAT) signal transduction pathway. The diagnosis of PV is based on the 2016 World Health Organization (WHO) criteria utilizing a composite assessment of clinical and laboratory features. PV is associated with burdensome symptoms, reduced quality of life and thrombohemorrhagic complications with potential for myelofibrotic and/or leukemic transformation. Thrombotic complications are a major cause of morbidity and mortality with a reported incidence of 12–39%. Patients suffer from large vessel arterial and venous thrombosis, as well as microcirculatory symptoms such as dizziness, headaches, visual disturbances, erythromelalgia, distal paresthesia and acrocyanosis. In the European Collaboration on Low-Dose Aspirin in Polycythemia Vera (ECLAP) prospective study, age older than 65 years and prior thrombotic events were identified as risk factors for cardiovascular events among PV patients. Importantly, arterial and venous thrombosis are two biologically different processes with distinct risk factors. The International Working Group on Myeloproliferative Neoplasms Research and Treatment (IWG-MRT) identified prior arterial events and hypertension as risk factors for arterial thrombosis and prior venous events and age ≥ 65 years as risk factors for venous thrombosis in PV. In this single center study, we sought to validate the findings of the IWG-MRT based on WHO 2016 PV diagnostic criteria, as well as identify additional risk factors for arterial versus venous thrombosis, including possible associations with the most frequent "non-driver" mutations: Tet methylcytosine dioxygenase 2 (TET2) (22%) and Additional sex combs like-1 (ASXL1) (12%).

Pruritus

Pruritus is common in PV, occurring in up to 85% of patients (Mesa et al, 2017). Pruritus can predate or accompany the diagnosis of PV (Le Gall‐Ianotto et al, 2017). It can occur spontaneously or be precipitated by water or changes in temperature and can have a significant negative impact on quality of life, affecting sleep, participation in social activities and bathing (Siegel et al, 2013). The intensity of pruritus varies but can be severe causing emotional depression, anxiety and even suicide ideation.

The pathogenesis of pruritus in PV is not clear. Mechanisms involving basophils (Pieri et al, 2009) and mast cells (Ishii et al, 2009) have been postulated. It can also be associated with the iron deficiency that commonly results from frequent venesection therapy. Pruritus has been found to be correlated with granulocyte JAK2 V617F homozygosity and allele burden (Vannucchi et al, 2007; Gangat et al, 2008). The mechanism for this association is unclear though it may relate to cytokine levels.

The management of pruritus is challenging. Symptoms can improve or resolve with control of blood counts, using venesection alone or with cytoreductive therapy (Le Gall‐Ianotto et al, 2017). Improvement in pruritus has been reported with hydroxycarbamide (Sharon et al, 1986), interferon (although this drug can also worsen pruritus) (Lengfelder et al, 2000), busulfan and 32 P (Jackson et al, 1987). Trials of ruxolitinib in PV have shown this agent to be effective in controlling pruritus in patients who have failed to respond to hydroxycarbamide (Vannucchi, 2015; Mesa et al, 2017; Passamonti et al, 2017). In those who are severely iron deficient as a result of venesection, pruritus may improve with iron replacement, if this is possible, but iron replacement must be undertaken with extreme caution and close supervision of blood counts.

### Dysregulated iron metabolism in polycythemia vera: etiology and consequences [^39d6fc0f]. Leukemia (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocytosis (ET), and primary myelofibrosis (MF) are the classical BCR-ABL negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs). These blood cancers represent a heterogeneous group of clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorders with constitutively activated physiologic signal-transduction pathways. PV is characterized by erythrocytosis, bone marrow erythroid and megakaryocytic hyperplasia, fatigue, aquagenic pruritus, microvascular symptoms, and symptomatic splenomegaly. Complications of PV include a significantly increased risk of arterial and venous thrombosis (41%) and the potential for evolution to MF (10–20%) and MPN-blast phase (3–10%), significantly reducing survival. Most patients with PV present with iron deficiency at diagnosis, even prior to the onset of therapeutic phlebotomy, the mainstay of treatment. Iron deficiency is often exacerbated by repeated phlebotomies, a desired effect thought to limit the accelerated erythropoiesis by restricting a necessary component of hemoglobin synthesis. This can lead to symptoms such as cognitive impairment and fatigue, even in the absence of anemia. Recent studies demonstrate that available therapies might improve PV-related symptoms in part by reversing iron deficiency. The genesis of iron deficiency in PV and its effect on disease manifestations and natural history have been explored to a limited extent. In this review, we focus on what is known about iron metabolism and erythropoiesis in PV. In addition, we build on recent advances in understanding the regulation of iron metabolism to enhance our understanding of PV pathophysiology and ultimately propose alternative therapeutic options.

### The efficacy and safety of continued hydroxycarbamide therapy versus switching to ruxolitinib in patients with polycythaemia vera: a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, symptom study (RELIEF) [^30b4dcc0]. British Journal of Haematology (2017). Low credibility.

The safety and tolerability profile of ruxolitinib observed in RELIEF was consistent with that reported in previous phase 2 and 3 studies of patients intolerant of or resistant to HC (Verstovsek et al, 2014; Vannucchi et al, 2015). Adverse events were generally grades 1 or 2, with few patients (7·4%) discontinuing ruxolitinib treatment because of an adverse event.

In conclusion, treatment with ruxolitinib was associated with a nonsignificant trend towards improvements in TSS‐C compared with HC in patients who had generally well‐controlled PV with a stable dose of HC but still reported disease‐associated symptoms. A statistically significant improvement in itching was observed with ruxolitinib compared with HC, trends towards improvements with ruxolitinib were observed in all other symptoms, and patients with stable screening‐to‐baseline TSS‐C were less likely to report responses to treatment with HC. The large proportion of patients achieving the primary endpoint while continuing to receive a stable HC dose was unexpected and may have implications for the design of future clinical trials.

### Current pain management strategies for patients with erythromelalgia: a critical review [^840b229c]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of EM is based on evaluation of the symptom profile and exclusion of other differential diagnosis. This may include myeloproliferative disorders, connective tissue diseases, malignancy, and peripheral neuropathy. Diagnoses that present with similar features include complex regional pain syndrome and Fabry disease. There are some differences in patients with complex regional pain syndrome. In the majority of cases, there is unilateral limb involvement and cold stimuli will usually worsen the pain. As for Fabry disease, it is an X-linked lysosomal storage disorder due to α-galactosidase deficiency secondary to GLA gene mutation. Pain is an early symptom localized to the hands and feet with hyperalgesia or allodynia. This may be triggered by extremes of temperature. Laboratory testing for α-galactosidase can be conducted to rule out Fabry disease. There are also reports of EM symptoms secondary to drugs, and cessation of the offending agent has been reported to be associated with resolution of symptoms (Table 1). For secondary EM, documented associations include myeloproliferative diseases such as polycythemia vera, idiopathic thrombocytosis, or other conditions such as diabetes mellitus (Table 2). This has clinical significance as treatment of the underlying disease process may reduce EM symptomatology. Targeted specific therapy based on the pathophysiology of EM may be more effective, for example, aspirin may be more effective in patients with EM and polycythemia vera.

Management of pruritus

Pruritus, sometimes aquagenic, is one of the most annoying, but not necessarily life-threatening complications of PV. In fact, in a recent large international study of 1545 patients with PV, presence of pruritus was independently associated with longer survival. Among 441 German patients with PV, 301 (68%) reported pruritus (severe and unbearable in 15%), occurring in the majority prior to the diagnosis of PV. In our own experience involving 418 patients seen at the Mayo Clinic, pruritus at diagnosis was documented in 31% and was associated with a lower rate of arterial thrombosis and higher JAK2 V617F allele burden. The latter observation was confirmed by others as well. Treatment options for PV-associated pruritus include antihistamines, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), danazol, IFN-α, narrow-band ultraviolet B phototherapy, photochemotherapy with psoralen and ultraviolet A light (PUVA), and JAK2or mTOR inhibitors. Amongst these, we recommend initial therapy with antihistamines and SSRIs, followed by IFN-α therapy for more severe and refractory cases, and reserve treatment with JAK2 inhibitors for high-risk patients with IFN-α-resistant pruritus.

Management during pregnancy

There are few published data on the occurrence and outcome of pregnancy in PV patients –. Therefore, our recommendations in this regard are mostly extrapolated from the experience in ET, which is consistent with the management strategy outlined in the limited series of anecdotal reports on PV. As is the case with ET, there appears to be increased miscarriage rates but otherwise mostly uneventful course and successful outcome –. Accordingly, we do not consider pregnancy to be contraindicated in women with PV and advise conservative management with once-daily aspirin therapy and phlebotomy to be adequate in "low risk" women, while we recommend the addition of pegylated IFN- α for high-risk disease. In addition, patients should be closely monitored for pregnancy-induced hypertension.

### The efficacy and safety of continued hydroxycarbamide therapy versus switching to ruxolitinib in patients with polycythaemia vera: a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, symptom study (RELIEF) [^5a53d488]. British Journal of Haematology (2017). Low credibility.

The randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, phase 3b RELIEF trial evaluated polycythaemia vera (PV)-related symptoms in patients who were well controlled with a stable dose of hydroxycarbamide (also termed hydroxyurea) but reported PV-related symptoms. Patients were randomized 1:1 to ruxolitinib 10 mg BID (n = 54) or hydroxycarbamide (prerandomization dose/schedule; n = 56); crossover to ruxolitinib was permitted after Week 16. The primary endpoint, ≥ 50% improvement from baseline in myeloproliferative neoplasm -symptom assessment form total symptom score cytokine symptom cluster (TSS-C; sum of tiredness, itching, muscle aches, night sweats, and sweats while awake) at Week 16, was achieved by 43·4% vs. 29·6% of ruxolitinib- and hydroxycarbamide-treated patients, respectively (odds ratio, 1·82; 95% confidence interval, 0·82–4·04; P = 0·139). The primary endpoint was achieved by 34% of a subgroup who maintained their hydroxycarbamide dose from baseline to Weeks 13–16. In a post hoc analysis, the primary endpoint was achieved by more patients with stable screening-to-baseline TSS-C scores (ratio ≤ 2) receiving ruxolitinib than hydroxycarbamide (47·4% vs. 25·0%; P = 0·0346). Ruxolitinib treatment after unblinding was associated with continued symptom score improvements. Adverse events were primarily grades 1/2 with no unexpected safety signals. Ruxolitinib was associated with a nonsignificant trend towards improved PV-related symptoms versus hydroxycarbamide, although an unexpectedly large proportion of patients who maintained their hydroxycarbamide dose reported symptom improvement.

### Combination therapy with ruxolitinib and pegylated interferon alfa-2a in newly diagnosed patients with polycythemia vera [^7965f16c]. Blood Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

We observed a high rate of anemia; 68% and 20% had grade 1 or 2 anemia, respectively. Anemia was managed by reduction of doses and no grade 3 to 4 anemia was observed. In comparison, only 13% in the Ropeg-α2b group and 24% in the HU group of the CONTINUATION-PV trial had grade 1 to 2 anemia; 7% of RUX treated in the MAJIC trial had grade 3 anemia, while grade 1 to 2 were not reported. In the end, most patients were treated with lower doses of the drugs than the starting point.

One case of follicular lymphoma was observed which led to discontinuation of RUX due to a report showing an increased risk of aggressive lymphoma in patients with MF being treated with RUX. However, later reports have not been able to cooperate with this finding and this event is most likely unrelated to the treatment.

Surprisingly, 68% of our patients reported sensory neuropathy; however, more than half only reported this symptom at 3 or fewer time points and not at the final evaluation. Our data does not suggest that these symptoms worsened during the treatment. There are no prior studies to suggest that Peg-IFN-α2a or RUX induce neuropathy, including the COMBI I study. Indeed, chronic neuropathy may be a much-overlooked symptom in the elderly population, that is unraveled when patients are being asked regularly about it like in this study. However, this issue needs further investigation.

There was a difference in the frequencies of grade 1 to 2 AEs compared with COMBI I. In this study, in which safety was the primary objective, we routinely asked the patient to grade several AEs (described in "Methods"); this was not done in COMBI I study. This will inadvertently result in more AEs not necessarily related to the study drugs. Taken together, we do not believe that the toxicity profile of this treatment should raise concern.

### Polycythemia vera: historical oversights, diagnostic details, and therapeutic views [^a738971f]. Leukemia (2021). Medium credibility.

New drugs in the horizon

PTG-300 (hepcidin mimetic)

PTG-300 (Rusfertide) is a hepcidin mimetic whose mechanism of action includes restriction of iron availability (i.e. negative iron regulation) for red blood cell production. In other words, it recapitulates iron deficiency at the cellular level, without depleting iron stores. The drug is administered by weekly subcutaneous injection at escalating doses of 10, 20, 40, 60, and 80 mg, adjusted to maintain hematocrit < 45%. The most recent (2020) EHA presentation abstract included 35 patients including 16 with low-risk disease. PTG-300 therapy resulted in significant reduction of phlebotomy need; among 13 patients treated for at least 28 weeks, 10 remained phlebotomy free and concomitant iron deficiency was reversed in most instances, associated with improvement in symptoms. Reported side effects of PTG-300 included transient low-grade injection site reactions. Of note, PTG-300 did not appear to affect leukocyte or platelet count. We are not certain about the prospect of PTG-300 within the therapeutic program for PV for a number of reasons; first, high-risk patients require broader myelosuppression to prevent thrombotic complications and such treatment is often more than adequate to control the hematocrit as well; second, in low-risk patients, hematocrit control is easily achieved with drug-free phlebotomy and if an alternative to phlebotomy is needed, for one reason or another, peg-IFN offers a more attractive option since it also controls thrombocytosis, leukocytosis, splenomegaly, and certain symptoms such as aquagenic pruritus. Also, peg-IFN has a much longer track record of safety.

### Polycythemia vera treatment algorithm 2018 [^38171ea1]. Blood Cancer Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Recently reported mature survival data have confirmed the favorable prognosis in polycythemia vera (PV), with an estimated median survival of 24 years, in patients younger than age 60 years old. Currently available drugs for PV have not been shown to prolong survival or alter the natural history of the disease and are instead indicated primarily for prevention of thrombosis. Unfortunately, study endpoints that are being utilized in currently ongoing clinical trials in PV do not necessarily target clinically or biologically relevant outcomes, such as thrombosis, survival, or morphologic remission, and are instead focused on components of disease palliation. Even more discouraging has been the lack of critical appraisal from "opinion leaders", on the added value of newly approved drugs. Keeping these issues in mind, at present, we continue to advocate conservative management in low-risk PV (phlebotomy combined with once- or twice-daily aspirin therapy) and include cytoreductive therapy in "high-risk" patients; in the latter regard, our first, second, and third line drugs of choice are hydroxyurea, pegylated interferon-α and busulfan, respectively. In addition, it is reasonable to consider JAK2 inhibitor therapy, in the presence of protracted pruritus or markedly enlarged splenomegaly shown to be refractory to the aforementioned drugs.

### Do all patients with polycythemia vera or essential thrombocythemia need cytoreduction? [^bacd8a16]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2018). Low credibility.

Polycythemia vera (PV) and essential thrombocythemia (ET) are Philadelphia chromosome-negative chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), characterized by expansion of normal blood counts, bleeding, thrombosis, and the potential for transformation to myelofibrosis (MF) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The primary goals of treatment for MPNs are to reduce the risk of thrombosis, alleviate systemic symptom burden (eg, fatigue, pruritus, microvascular symptoms, and symptomatic splenomegaly), and to prevent transformation to MF/AML. Preventing transformation is clearly important, but not expected with current therapies. Currently, cytoreduction is advised based on vascular risk assessments, which include age and thrombosis history, as well as molecular profile in ET. Traditionally, cytoreduction has been advised only in patients with high vascular risk. Recently, a large prospective study evaluated the safety and efficacy of cytoreduction in patients with ET with less-than-high-risk vascular profiles. A larger question in the MPN field is whether cytoreduction is advisable for all patients with ET and PV, regardless of risk. This article reviews existing data on cytoreduction, evaluating hydroxyurea, interferons, and ruxolitinib in ET and PV. This review evaluates whether evidence supports a more liberal strategy of cytoreduction for all patients with ET and PV.

### Polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia: 2013 update on diagnosis, risk-stratification, and management [^407d028b]. American Journal of Hematology (2013). Low credibility.

Disease Overview

Polycythemia Vera (PV) and essential thrombocythemia (ET) are myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) primarily characterized by erythrocytosis and thrombocytosis, respectively. Other disease features include leukocytosis, splenomegaly, thrombohemorrhagic complications, vasomotor disturbances, pruritus and a small risk of disease progression into acute myeloid leukemia or myelofibrosis.

Diagnosis

Almost all patients with PV harbor a JAK2 mutation. When PV is suspected, the presence of a JAK2 mutation highly suggests the diagnosis and its absence, combined with normal or increased serum erythropoietin level, excludes the diagnosis. Differential diagnosis of ET should include reactive thrombocytosis, chronic myeloid leukemia, prefibrotic myelofibrosis and RARS-T (refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts associated with marked thrombocytosis). A JAK2 mutation is found in 50–70% of patients with ET, myelofibrosis or RARS-T and is capable of distinguishing reactive from clonal thrombocytosis.

Risk Stratification

Current risk stratification in PV and ET is designed to estimate the likelihood of thrombotic complications: high-risk is defined by the presence of age > 60 years or presence of thrombosis history; low-risk is defined by the absence of both of these two risk factors. Recent data considers JAK2V617F and cardiovascular (CV) risk factors as additional risk factors for thrombosis. Presence of extreme thrombocytosis (platelet count > 1,000 × 10(9) /L) might be associated with acquired von Willebrand syndrome (AvWS) and, therefore, risk of bleeding. Risk factors for shortened survival in both PV and ET include advanced age, leukocytosis, and history of thrombosis.

Risk-Adapted Therapy

Survival is near-normal in ET and reasonably long in PV. The 10-year risk of leukemic/fibrotic transformation is < 1%/1% in ET and < 3%/10% in PV. In contrast, the risk of thrombosis exceeds 20%. The main goal of therapy is therefore to prevent thrombohemorrhagic complications. In low risk patients, this is effectively and safely accomplished by the use of low-dose aspirin in both PV and ET and phlebotomy (hematocrit target of < 45%) in PV. In high risk patients, treatment with hydroxyurea is additionally recommended, although not mandated in older patients without JAK2V617F or CV risk factors. Treatment with busulfan or interferon-α is usually effective in hydroxyurea failures. Screening for clinically significant AvWS is recommended before administrating aspirin in the presence of extreme thrombocytosis.

Methods

Patients

Eligible patients were ≥ 18 years of age, diagnosed with PV according to the World Health Organization criteria (Tefferi & Vardiman, 2008), treated with HC monotherapy for ≥ 12 weeks before enrolment, had received a stable dose of HC for ≥ 4 weeks before enrolment and had cytokine‐related symptoms defined as a score ≥ 8 (maximum, 50) on the MPN‐SAF TSS cytokine symptom cluster (TSS‐C) (Vannucchi et al, 2015). The TSS‐C is the sum of individual scores for tiredness, itching, muscle aches, night sweats and sweats while awake, each rated on a scale of 0 (absent) to 10 (worst imaginable). The requirement for TSS‐C score ≥ 8 (i.e., mean score ≥ 1·6 on each of the 5 individual components) was implemented to ensure that patients had an adequate symptom score at baseline to assess meaningful changes in the primary endpoint. The TSS clusters were identified using an empirical statistical factor analysis of baseline MPN‐SAF scores from the phase 3 RESPONSE trial (Vannucchi et al, 2015). This analysis divided the 14 individual MPN‐SAF symptoms into 3 symptom clusters independent of presumed pathophysiological mechanisms. From a clinical perspective, the 3 symptom clusters agreed well with 3 presumptive pathophysiological mechanisms associated with PV‐related symptoms (cytokines, hyperviscosity and splenomegaly). Eligible patients had ≤ 2 phlebotomies in the 6 months before screening or no palpable splenomegaly; therefore, the TSS‐C was chosen to define patient eligibility and the primary endpoint. Eligible patients also had haematocrit values between 35% and 48% before randomization; had recovered from all phlebotomy‐associated adverse events, with ≥ 1 week elapsed between the last phlebotomy and baseline; and had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0–2 at baseline. Patients with inadequate liver or renal function, platelet count < 100 × 10 9 /l, neutrophil count < 1 × 10 9 /l, or peripheral blood blast count > 0% at screening were not eligible.

### Light-related cutaneous symptoms of erythropoietic protoporphyria and associations with light sensitivity measurements [^3ce785c5]. JAMA Dermatology (2023). High credibility.

Importance

Erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP) is a rare and underdiagnosed genetic disease characterized by painful sensitivity to light. A better understanding and characterization of its light-induced cutaneous symptoms may aid in the identification of EPP in patients.

Objectives

To describe the cutaneous symptoms of erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP) and to determine if these symptoms are associated with the degree of light sensitivity.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This was a cross-sectional study of adolescent and adult (≥ 15 years) patients with EPP across the US conducted by a single academic hospital via a remotely administered survey, measurements of light sensitivity by light dosimetry and by text message symptom assessments. Data analyses were conducted from November 2020 to April 2022.

Exposures

Sunlight exposure.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Self-reported symptoms and association with measured light sensitivity.

Results

The study sample consisted of 35 patients with EPP (mean [SD] age, 39.1 (15.5) years; 21 [60%] female; 14 [40%] male; 35 [100%] White individuals). The patients' median [range] skin tone was 3.0 (1.0–8.0), based on self-reporting from 1 (lightest) to 12 (darkest). A total of 24 participants completed the light dosimeter measurements. Phototoxic reactions were characterized by pain (97%; 34 patients), burning (97%; 34), tingling (97%; 34), pruritus (83%; 29), allodynia (89%; 31), improvement of symptoms with cold (89%; 31), achiness (24%; 12), fatigue (46%; 16), mild swelling (83%; 29), severe swelling (63%; 22), erythema (51%; 18), petechiae (40%; 14), skin cracking (43%; 15), scabbing (46%; 16), scarring (66%; 23), and other chronic skin changes (40%; 14). Patients with EPP reported that their hands, feet, and face were most sensitive to light and that their shoulders and legs were least sensitive; 25.7% (9 patient) reported no chronic skin changes, and 5.7% (2 patients) reported never having had any visible symptoms. None of these findings varied with the degree of light sensitivity except that lower overall light sensitivity was associated with lower ranked sensitivity of the neck and arms.

Conclusions and Relevance

The findings of this cross-sectional study suggest that patients with EPP have distinctive cutaneous symptoms that may aid in identification of this underdiagnosed disease. Characteristic EPP symptoms include light-induced cutaneous burning pain and occasional swelling, particularly over the hands, with a prodrome of pruritus and paresthesias. Minimal skin changes or the absence of visible skin changes during reactions to light, including lack of erythema, do not exclude an EPP diagnosis nor suggest low EPP disease burden.

### A randomized phase 3 trial of interferon-α vs hydroxyurea in polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia [^a882f1a2]. Blood (2022). Medium credibility.

Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to HU or PEG within strata defined by disease type (ET/PV) using block randomization. PEG (provided by Roche/Genentech Pharmaceuticals, Nutley, NJ) was self-administered by subcutaneous injection at 45 μg weekly and titrated in 45-μg increments monthly to a maximum of 180 μg weekly. HU was initiated at 500 mg twice daily. Dose modification occurred when criteria for hematologic complete response (CR) were not met or dose-limiting toxicity occurred. Guidance and direction for dosing and escalations for both agents were provided in the protocol; the dosing protocol guidelines are included in the supplemental Appendix.

An intention-to-treat (ITT) evaluation was performed at 12, 24, and 36 months. Patients achieving at least a hematologic partial response (PR) remained on treatment, and length of therapy was determined by time of entrance into the study. The last subject to enter the study could receive therapy for at most 12 months, and the first subjects could receive therapy for up to 64 months. All patients were included in response assessments. The primary endpoint was the comparison of CR rates (as defined by European LeukemiaNet [ELN] criteria to after 12 months of therapy).CR was defined as a platelet count < 400 × 10 9 /L, hematocrit < 45% without phlebotomy for patients with PV only, white blood cell count < 10 × 10 9 /L, resolution of splenomegaly, and resolution of disease-related symptoms (microvascular disturbances, headache, and pruritus). Responses were assessed by a central review committee blinded to treatment. Splenomegaly was assessed by ultrasound measurement of the craniocaudal axis (splenomegaly defined as > 13 cm). Patients completed the Myeloproliferative Neoplasm Symptom Assessment Form, the European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-C30, and 5 exploratory questions to assess PEG-related side effects on a serial basis at baseline and 3, 6, 9, and 12 months.

### Therapeutic options for patients with polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia refractory / resistant to hydroxyurea [^b13882dd]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2014). Low credibility.

Hydroxyurea (HU) has traditionally been the first-line treatment for patients with polycythemia vera (PV) or essential thrombocythemia (ET) at high risk for vascular complications. However, approximately 20–25% of patients develop resistance or intolerance to HU and must be treated with second-line therapies. Resistance is associated with disease transformation and reduced survival. However, given the dearth of large-scale controlled clinical trials in this patient population, there is no clear consensus on how to best treat patients who develop resistance or intolerance to HU. Herein, we review current literature on treatment options for patients with HU-refractory/resistant PV or ET and provide recommendations for treating these patients.

### Narrative review: thrombocytosis, polycythemia vera, and JAK2 mutations: the phenotypic mimicry of chronic myeloproliferation [^eeb18c3c]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

The myeloproliferative disorders polycythemia vera, essential thrombocytosis, and primary myelofibrosis are clonal disorders arising in a pluripotent hematopoietic stem cell, causing an unregulated increase in the number of erythrocytes, leukocytes, or platelets, alone or in combination; eventual marrow dominance by the progeny of the involved stem cell; and a tendency to arterial or venous thrombosis, marrow fibrosis, splenomegaly, or transformation to acute leukemia, albeit at widely varying frequencies. The discovery of an activating mutation (V617F) in the gene for JAK2 (Janus kinase 2), a tyrosine kinase utilized by hematopoietic cell receptors for erythropoietin, thrombopoietin, and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, provided an explanation for the shared clinical features of these 3 disorders. Constitutive JAK2 activation provides a growth and survival advantage to the hematopoietic cells of the affected clone. Because signaling by the mutated kinase utilizes normal pathways, the result is overproduction of morphologically normal blood cells, an often indolent course, and (in essential thrombocytosis) usually a normal life span. Because the erythropoietin, thrombopoietin, and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptors are all constitutively activated, polycythemia vera is the potential ultimate clinical phenotype of the JAK2 V617F mutation and, as a corollary, is the most common of the 3 disorders. The number of cells expressing the JAK2 V617F mutation (the allele burden) seems to correlate with the clinical phenotype. Preliminary results of clinical trials with agents that inhibit the mutated kinase indicate a reduction in splenomegaly and alleviation of night sweats, fatigue, and pruritus.

### Dysregulated iron metabolism in polycythemia vera: etiology and consequences [^2f6f2777]. Leukemia (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Patients with PV present with iron deficiency despite expanded erythropoiesis and recurrent therapeutic phlebotomy induces further degrees of iron deficiency. Significant progress has been made in defining the molecular basis of PV as well as physiological and pathological regulation of iron metabolism. Furthermore, together with newly delineated molecular mechanisms involved in the iron restriction response, this knowledge enables a more nuanced evaluation of aberrant erythroid regulation of iron metabolism and iron sensing which regulate erythropoiesis in PV. Understanding the dysregulation of iron metabolism in PV may enable the development of novel therapeutics. In the interim, exploring chemical means of inducing erythropoiesis-targeted iron restriction may benefit PV patients requiring repeat therapeutic phlebotomy.

### Survival and prognosis among 1545 patients with contemporary polycythemia vera: an international study [^d6536868]. Leukemia (2013). Low credibility.

Discussion

A number of novel observations and important confirmations are born out of this study. We show, for the first time, the prognostic relevance of karyotype, which is in line with the experience in most myeloid malignancies, including primary (PMF) and post-PV MF. The reason why this was not evident in previous PV studies might be related to inadequate sample size and follow-up time. Unlike the case with PMF, the number of patients with cytogenetic abnormalities was too small to further query differential prognostic effect associated with specific cytogenetic abnormalities. Regardless, our findings signify the potential value of obtaining cytogenetic information in patients with PV and warrant additional studies to determine if the acquisition of an abnormal karyotype carries a similar significance. It also points out the need to examine the prognostic contribution of submicroscopic genetic changes, as has been the case in PMF.

Another novel observation from this study was the association between pruritus and superior survival. This might simply reflect a lead-time bias stemming from symptom-driven earlier diagnosis. However, it is also possible that pruritus in PV is a marker of an underlying favorable biology, as suggested by its previously reported association with a lower incidence of arterial thrombosis. Regardless, considering the negative effect on quality of life, the particular observation is consoling for patients with pruritus. The only other disease variable that was associated with good prognosis was thrombocytosis, although its significance was less pronounced in the presence of cytogenetic information. It is to be recalled that extreme thrombocytosis in WHO-defined ET was associated with a lower incidence of arterial thrombosis. Taken together, these observations should serve to lessen the pressure to take therapeutic action in patients with PV or ET, based simply on platelet count.

### Treatment of polycythemia vera… [^f5980474]. AAFP (2003). Low credibility.

Polycythemia vera is one of three chronic myeloproliferative disorders, along with essential thrombocythemia and myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia. The incidence of PV is 2. 3 per 100, 000 patients, and the median age at diagnosis is 60 years. Tefferi recommends treatment options for PV. Polycythemia describes an increase in red blood cell mass. The increase in red blood cell mass may be caused by an actual increase in red blood cell mass or a spurious laboratory value. True polycythemia is classified as either primary or secondary. Primary polycythemia is caused by a myeloproliferation and is not mediated by excess erythropoietin. In contrast, secondary polycythemia can be caused by an external source, such as "smoker's polycythemia, " or an internal disorder, such as renal cancer. Erythropoietin levels in secondary polycythemias vary depending on the etiology.

PV can have life-threatening complications, including stroke and evolution into either myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia or acute leukemia. Treatment is directed according to patient risk stratification. Frequent phlebotomy and chemotherapy are the cornerstones of treatment. Hematocrit levels should be maintained below 45 percent in white men and 42 percent in women and blacks. Chemotherapy using hydroxyurea, busulfan, or pipobroman is indicated for high-risk patients. Interferon-alfa is another chemotherapeutic option for reducing red blood cell burden and treating PV-associated pruritus. Non-life–threatening sequelae include microvascular complications and aquagenic pruritus.

Microvascular complications may appear clinically as headache, light-headed-ness, transient neurologic abnormality, transient ocular disturbance, tinnitus, atypical chest pain, paresthesias, and erythromelalgia. Low-dose aspirin can be used to treat these disorders. Aquagenic pruritus is a generalized body itching often brought on by a hot bath. Treatment options include either selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or interferon-alfa.

### Ropeginterferon alfa-2b versus standard therapy for polycythaemia vera (PROUD-PV and CONTINUATION-PV): a randomised, non-inferiority, phase 3 trial and its extension study [^08faede6]. The Lancet: Haematology (2020). High credibility.

Background

The PROUD-PV and CONTINUATION-PV trials aimed to compare the novel monopegylated interferon ropeginterferon alfa-2b with hydroxyurea, the standard therapy for patients with polycythaemia vera, over 3 years of treatment.

Methods

PROUD-PV and its extension study, CONTINUATION-PV, were phase 3, randomised, controlled, open-label, trials done in 48 clinics in Europe. Patients were eligible if 18 years or older with early stage polycythaemia vera (no history of cytoreductive treatment or less than 3 years of previous hydroxyurea treatment) diagnosed by WHO's 2008 criteria. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to ropeginterferon alfa-2b (subcutaneously every 2 weeks, starting at 100 μg) or hydroxyurea (orally starting at 500 mg/day). After 1 year, patients could opt to enter the extension part of the trial, CONTINUATION-PV. The primary endpoint in PROUD-PV was non-inferiority of ropeginterferon alfa-2b versus hydroxyurea regarding complete haematological response with normal spleen size (longitudinal diameter of ≤ 12 cm for women and ≤ 13 cm for men) at 12 months; in CONTINUATION-PV, the coprimary endpoints were complete haematological response with normalisation of spleen size and with improved disease burden (ie, splenomegaly, microvascular disturbances, pruritus, and headache). We present the final results of PROUD-PV and an interim analysis at 36 months of the CONTINUATION-PV study (per statistical analysis plan). Analyses for safety and efficacy were per-protocol. The trials were registered on EudraCT, 2012-005259-18 (PROUD-PV) and 2014-001357-17 (CONTINUATION-PV, which is ongoing).

Findings

Patients were recruited from Sept 17, 2013 to March 13, 2015 with 306 enrolled. 257 patients were randomly assigned, 127 were treated in each group (three patients withdrew consent in the hydroxyurea group), and 171 rolled over to the CONTINUATION-PV trial. Median follow-up was 182·1 weeks (IQR 166·3–201·7) in the ropeginterferon alfa-2b and 164·5 weeks (144·4–169·3) in the standard therapy group. In PROUD-PV, 26 (21%) of 122 patients in the ropeginterferon alfa-2b group and 34 (28%) of 123 patients in the standard therapy group met the composite primary endpoint of complete haematological response with normal spleen size. In CONTINUATION-PV, complete haematological response with improved disease burden was met in 50 (53%) of 95 patients in the ropeginterferon alfa-2b group versus 28 (38%) of 74 patients in the hydroxyurea group, p = 0·044 at 36 months. Complete haematological response without the spleen criterion in the ropeginterferon alfa-2b group versus standard therapy group were: 53 (43%) of 123 patients versus 57 (46%) of 125 patients, p = 0·63 at 12 months (PROUD-PV), and 67 (71%) of 95 patients versus 38 (51%) of 74 patients, p = 0·012 at 36 months (CONTINUATION-PV). The most frequently reported grade 3 and grade 4 treatment-related adverse events were increased γ-glutamyltransferase (seven [6%] of 127 patients) and increased alanine aminotransferase (four [3%] of 127 patients) in the ropeginterferon alfa-2b group, and leucopenia (six [5%] of 127 patients) and thrombocytopenia (five [4%] of 127 patients) in the standard therapy group. Treatment-related serious adverse events occurred in three (2%) of 127 patients in the ropeginterferon alfa-2b group and five (4%) of 127 patients in the hydroxyurea group. One treatment-related death was reported in the standard therapy group (acute leukaemia).

Interpretation

In patients with early polycythaemia vera, who predominantly presented without splenomegaly, ropeginterferon alfa-2b was effective in inducing haematological responses; non-inferiority to hydroxyurea regarding haematological response and normal spleen size was not shown at 12 months. However, response to ropeginterferon alfa-2b continued to increase over time with improved responses compared with hydroxyurea at 36 months. Considering the high and durable haematological and molecular responses and its good tolerability, ropeginterferon alfa-2b offers a valuable and safe long-term treatment option with features distinct from hydroxyurea.

### Upadacitinib as a treatment for chronic pruritus secondary to polycythemia vera after failure with dupilumab [^24fab169]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

The underlying cause of CP must be addressed first, and numerous treatment modalities for PCV are available. However, there are limited data from randomized controlled trials evaluating the comparative efficacy of treatments for CP. First-line therapy for CP includes conservative treatment with topical emollients and cleansers. Additional topical therapies include capsaicin, menthol, and glucocorticoids. Systemic therapies, including antidepressants (paroxetine or mirtazapine) or anticonvulsants (pregabalin or gabapentin), may be used if topical agents are unsuccessful. Phototherapy has also been demonstrated to improve pruritus secondary to various underlying disorders. Monoclonal antibodies, such as dupilumab, have been used successfully in various cases of CP. No previous reports have attempted to use dupilumab in CP secondary to PCV.

Upadacitinib is a small-molecule JAK inhibitor with increased selectivity for JAK1 receptors. It is currently approved for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, AD, psoriatic arthritis, ulcerative colitis, and ankylosing spondylitis after failing initial treatment with disease-targeted agents. It may also be used off-label by clinicians for other conditions after appropriate treatment modalities have failed. For conditions such as AD in which pruritus is often a chief complaint, upadacitinib has been found to be effective in improving symptoms. In a clinical trial of 167 patients across 8 countries with moderate-to-severe AD, all doses of upadacitinib (7.5, 15, and 30 mg oral once a day) reduced pruritus in the participants over a 16-week period. Our patient had no primary rash or evidence of active AD throughout the period that she experienced CP.

In our patient, a trial of upadacitinib was initiated after treatment with dupilumab briefly improved but ultimately failed in alleviating her symptoms. Although peginterferon alfa-2a successfully treated the primary hematologic manifestations of PCV, it did not alleviate the associated pruritus after a prolonged period of treatment. Off-label use of upadacitinib proved effective in relieving the pruritus by reducing her iNRS from 6/10 to 0/10 over the course of 8 months. The only adverse event that occurred was acneiform lesions on the face, which has been documented in other studies with upadacitinib use. Moreover, this is suggestive of the mechanism of JAK receptor inhibition possibly playing a role in selectively targeting pruritic symptoms associated with PCV. To our knowledge, this is the first report of upadacitinib improving CP secondary to PCV.

### Clinical outcomes under hydroxyurea treatment in polycythemia vera: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^da9b162e]. Haematologica (2019). Medium credibility.

In contrast, annual incidence of evolution into MF, as predicted by meta-regression, increases steeply after five years of follow up. Therefore, in the 0–5/5–10 years of observation periods, the average annual rate of MF evolution was 1.0% and 5.7%, respectively. Mortality followed a similar pattern as MF, although the divergence between the two meta-regression models was much less remarkable, with an overlap in 95%CI. We retrieved an incidence of second cancer of 1.7% patients per year. However, this may not be a reliable estimate given the limited number of events and the very large between-study heterogeneity for this outcome.

The first major strength of our work is the remarkable sample size we were able to put together, which allowed us to obtain robust estimates for the most relevant outcomes in PV. However, a possible limitation of our analysis is that most reports did not specifically address our study questions, and consequently the relative estimates are based on raw frequency data extracted from descriptive tables or text. Furthermore, we cannot exclude bias in reporting events in individual studies, since most of these were not specifically designed to answer our primary questions. On the other hand, the fact that the studies did not address our question makes publication bias in favor of certain results very unlikely.

### Polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia: 2012 update on diagnosis, risk stratification, and management [^8c7bc11a]. American Journal of Hematology (2012). Low credibility.

Disease Overview

Polycythemia vera (PV) and essential thrombocythemia (ET) are myeloproliferative neoplasms primarily characterized by erythrocytosis and thrombocytosis, respectively. Other disease features include leukocytosis, splenomegaly, thrombohemorrhagic complications, vasomotor disturbances, pruritus, and a small risk of disease progression into acute myeloid leukemia or myelofibrosis.

Diagnosis

Almost all patients with PV harbor a JAK2 mutation. When PV is suspected, the presence of a JAK2 mutation confirms the diagnosis and its absence, combined with normal or increased serum erythropoietin level, excludes the diagnosis. Differential diagnosis of ET had to include chronic myelogenous leukemia and prefibrotic myelofibrosis. A JAK2 mutation is found in approximately 60% of patients with ET.

Risk Stratification

Current risk stratification in PV and ET is designed to estimate the likelihood of thrombotic complications: high-risk is defined by the presence of age > 60 years or presence of thrombosis history; low-risk is defined by the absence of both of these two risk factors. Presence of extreme thrombocytosis (platelet count > 1,000 × 10(9)/L) might be associated with acquired von Willebrand syndrome (AvWS) and, therefore, risk of bleeding. Risk factors for shortened survival in both PV and ET include advanced age, leukocytosis, and history of thrombosis.

Risk-Adapted Therapy

Survival is near-normal in ET and reasonably long in PV. The 10-year risk of leukemic/fibrotic transformation is < 1%/1% in ET and < 3%/10% in PV. In contrast, the risk of thrombosis exceeds 20%. The main goal of therapy is therefore to prevent thrombohemorrhagic complications and this is effectively and safely accomplished by the use of low-dose aspirin (PV and ET), phlebotomy (PV) and hydroxyurea (high risk PV and ET). Treatment with busulfan or interferon-α is usually effective in hydroxyurea failures. Screening for clinically significant AvWS is recommended before administrating aspirin in the presence of extreme thrombocytosis.

### Excessive wrinkling of the palms after brief water immersion [^b8680b45]. JAAD Case Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

Question 2: What disorder is this condition most likely associated with?
A. Polycythemia vera (PcV)
B. Myelodysplastic syndrome
C. Bernard-Soulier syndrome (BSS)
D. Cystic fibrosis (CF)
E. Hepatitis C

Answers:
A. PcV – Incorrect. Aquagenic pruritus is a characteristic symptom found in many patients with PcV. A recent study found that about two-thirds of patients with PcV had aquagenic pruritus.
B. Myelodysplastic syndrome – Incorrect. Myelodysplastic syndrome is reported to be associated with aquagenic pruritus and may precede the diagnosis by several years.
C. BSS – Incorrect. BSS is a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the GPIbα, GPIbβ, and GPIX genes. BSS has been associated with prolonged bleeding as well as aquagenic urticaria.
D. CF – Correct. AAK is often reported to be associated with CF, as a large number of patients with AAK exhibit mutations of the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. In fact, AAK is proposed as a possible sign of CF, with an estimation that between 44% and 80% of patients with CF has AAK. Our patient, however, did not have a known history of CF. Interestingly, AAK can be found in 10% to 25% of asymptomatic, heterozygous carriers of the CFTR gene mutation.
E. Hepatitis C – Incorrect. Hepatitis C is reported to be associated with aquagenic pruritus, not with AAK.

### Aquagenic pruritus in essential thrombocythemia is associated with a higher risk of thrombosis [^ddbb51f8]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Thromboses and phenotypic evolutions (leukemia, myelofibrosis) are the most frequent complications in polycythemia vera (PV) and essential thrombocythemia (ET). Aquagenic pruritus (AP) is not only PV symptom, but is also present in ET. The presence of pruritus in PV is associated with a lower risk of arterial thrombosis.

Aims

To date, no equivalent study has been done to analyse the impact of AP for ET patients.

Materials & Methods

We used the data from our cohort of patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms seen in our institution (OBENE database, NCT02897297). We collect information at diagnosis, presence or not of AP and all types of complications during their follow-up. To avoid masked PV, all JAK2 positive cases were tested isotopic red mass cell if appropriate.

Results

Among 396 ET patients, presence of AP was found in 42 (10.6%). ET patients with AP were more proliferative, more symptomatic at diagnosis and more difficult to treat. Furthermore, they presented increased risk of thromboses (30.9 versus 17%, P = 0.03; OR = 2.2 [1.01;4.66]) and phenotypic evolutions (33.3 versus 13.3%, P = 0.0007; OR = 3.2 [1.44;6.77]), during follow-up.

Discussion

Aquagenic pruritus is classically associated to PV. But we confirmed here that AP is also present in ET and characterizes patients with higher risk of morbidity (thrombotic events and phenotypic evolutions).

Conclusions

The systematic determination of the presence of AP in ET patients should permit us to better identify these high-risk patients for better management and follow-up.

### Safety and efficacy of CYT387, a JAK1 and JAK2 inhibitor, in myelofibrosis [^15184149]. Leukemia (2013). Low credibility.

JAK-STAT is a rational drug target in myelofibrosis (MF) given its association with JAK2 / MPL mutations and aberrant inflammatory cytokine expression. We conducted a Phase 1/2 trial of CYT387, a potent JAK1/2 inhibitor, in patients with high- or intermediate-risk primary or post-polycythemia vera/essential thrombocythemia MF. Pre-planned safety and efficacy analysis has been completed for the initial 60 patients. In the dose-escalation phase (n = 21), the maximum-tolerated dose was 300 mg/day based on reversible grade 3 headache and asymptomatic hyperlipasemia. Twenty-one and 18 additional patients were accrued at two biologically effective doses, 300 mg/day and 150 mg/day, respectively. Anemia and spleen responses, per International Working Group criteria, were 59% and 48%, respectively. Among 33 patients who were red cell-transfused in the month prior to study entry, 70% achieved a minimum 12-week period without transfusions (range 4.7– > 18.3 months). Most patients experienced constitutional symptoms improvement. Grade 3/4 adverse reactions included thrombocytopenia (32%), hyperlipasemia (5%), elevated liver transaminases (3%) and headache (3%). New-onset treatment-related peripheral neuropathy was observed in 22% of patients (sensory symptoms, grade 1). CYT387 is well tolerated and produces significant anemia, spleen and symptom responses in MF patients. Plasma cytokine and gene expression studies suggested a broad anticytokine drug effect.

### Polycythemia vera… [^2db19650]. AAFP (2004). Low credibility.

Polycythemia vera is a chronic myeloproliferative disorder characterized by an increased red blood cell mass, or erythrocytosis, which leads to hyperviscosity and an increased risk of thrombosis. Patients may present with complaints of pruritus after bathing, burning pains in the distal extremities, gastrointestinal disturbances, or nonspecific complaints such as weakness, headaches, or dizziness. Other patients are diagnosed after an incidental finding of an elevated hemoglobin and/or hematocrit level on a complete blood count. 3 PV also should be suspected in patients with portal venous thrombosis and splenomegaly with or without thrombocytosis and leukocytosis. Other signs and symptoms are listed in Table 1. 1, 4 In making the diagnosis of PV, the physician must first exclude a secondary erythrocytosis.

5, 6 Once a secondary cause is ruled out, the diagnosis of PV is made using a combination of major and minor criteria defined by the Polycythemia Vera Study Group. Although new diagnostic modalities have been developed, these criteria remain the standard method to diagnose PV.
8. 8–10 A patient with PV could have low oxygen saturation levels, because it is possible to have both PV and an unrelated hypoxic disorder. 1 Palpable splenomegaly is an important physical finding and major criterion. However, palpation is only 58 percent sensitive for diagnosis 11. Reduction of platelet counts with anagrelide has been proposed as a treatment option for PV, as with other myeloproliferative disorders, but this option has not been thoroughly studied. 1, 4 Because PV is rare, high-quality evidence supporting treatment is lacking.

Pruritus, particularly after bathing is a common symptom and various treatment options are available. Symptoms such as transient neurologic disturbances may respond to low-dose aspirin therapy. Erythromelalgia is rare, occurring in approximately 3 percent of patients with PV. Low-dose aspirin typically is used, with myelosuppressive therapy reserved for those patients who do not respond. 1.

### Aspirin in essential thrombocythemia. for whom? What formulation? What regimen? [^59e5835f]. Haematologica (2023). Medium credibility.

Aspirin as an antiplatelet and antithrombotic drug

Aspirin acetylates a serine residue at position 529 of cyclo-oxygenase-1 (COX-1), thus irreversibly inhibiting its metabolic pathway, which is responsible for the production of the platelet agonist and vasoconstrictive molecule TxA2. Virtually complete inhibition of TxA2 synthesis throughout the 24-hour interval between doses is necessary to prevent thrombotic events. Aspirin is widely used as an antithrombotic drug for the treatment of acute coronary syndromes and cerebrovascular accidents and for their secondary prevention. Although the net clinical benefit of aspirin in primary prevention of coronary and cerebrovascular disorders in the general population is unclear, it is well established in patients with polycythemia vera. The very good antithrombotic efficacy of aspirin, despite its very selective pharmacodynamics, is explained by the fact that TxA2 contributes to the amplification of platelet activation by almost any platelet agonist and is essential for the full aggregation response of platelets.

### JAK2 unmutated erythrocytosis: current diagnostic approach and therapeutic views [^205af582]. Leukemia (2021). Medium credibility.

Case 2: Secondary erythrocytosis associated with cerebrovascular malformations

A 17-year-old Caucasian male, a high school student from Missouri was referred for evaluation of unexplained erythrocytosis. He reported a myriad of symptoms including nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, weight loss, fatigue, headaches, cold hands and feet with numbness and tingling, hyperhidrosis, palpitations, and pruritus. He was a non-smoker without illicit drug or hormone use. Family history was unremarkable. On physical examination, no cutaneous, abdominal or neurological abnormalities were noted. A review of serial blood counts showed a consistent elevation in Hgb > 16.5 g/dl, with peak Hgb/Hct of 18.3 g/dl/52.4% and normal leukocyte and platelet counts. PV was excluded with a negative JAK2V617F /exon 12 mutation screen and elevated EPO at 22.6 mIU/mL (normal range; 2.6–18.5 mIU/mL). Bone marrow aspirate/biopsy was without features of a MPN. Hereditary erythrocytosis evaluation did not reveal high-affinity Hgb variants or mutations in 2,3-Bisphosphoglycerate Mutase (BPGM) (exons 1–4), EPOR (exon 8), or oxygen‐sensing pathway proteins, including hypoxia-inducible factor 2 α (HIF2A) encoded by endothelial PASS domain protein 1 (EPAS1) (exons 9 and 12), prolyl hydroxylase 2 (PHD2) encoded by egl-9 family hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (EGLN1) (exons 1–5), von Hippel Lindau (VHL) (three coding exons and intron/exon boundaries). Chest/abdominal imaging, arterial blood gas, transthoracic echocardiogram with shunt study, urinary catecholamines/metanephrines were unremarkable. Interestingly, MRI brain/spine revealed multiple cerebrovascular malformations; both developmental venous anomalies and cavernous hemangiomas in the frontal and temporal regions. Accordingly, the cerebrovascular malformations were hypothesized to be a plausible link to the patient's erythrocytosis. Surgical intervention was not feasible due to the presence of multiple anomalies. He was initiated on phlebotomies with marked improvement in symptoms; thereafter, need for periodic phlebotomies was determined by symptoms rather than a target Hct value. This previously published case underscores the importance of a systematic diagnostic approach to JAK2 unmutated erythrocytosis.

### The JAK2V617 mutation induces constitutive activation and agonist hypersensitivity in basophils from patients with polycythemia vera [^0fa059ac]. Haematologica (2009). Low credibility.

Background

The JAK2V617F mutation has been associated with constitutive and enhanced activation of neutrophils, while no information is available concerning other leukocyte subtypes.

Design and Methods

We evaluated correlations between JAK2V617F mutation and the count of circulating basophils, the number of activated CD63(+) basophils, their response in vitro to agonists as well as the effects of a JAK2 inhibitor.

Results

We found that basophil count was increased in patients with JAK2V617F -positive myeloproliferative neoplasms, particularly in those with polycythemia vera, and was correlated with the V617F burden. The burden of V617F allele was similar in neutrophils and basophils from patients with polycythemia vera, while total JAK2 mRNA content was remarkably greater in the basophils; however, the content of JAK2 protein in basophils was not increased. The number of CD63(+) basophils was higher in patients with polycythemia vera than in healthy subjects or patients with essential thrombocythemia or primary myelofibrosis and was correlated with the V617F burden. Ultrastructurally, basophils from patients with polycythemia vera contained an increased number of granules, most of which were empty suggesting cell degranulation in vivo. Ex vivo experiments revealed that basophils from patients with polycythemia vera were hypersensitive to the priming effect of interleukin-3 and to f-MLP-induced activation; pre-treatment with a JAK2 inhibitor reduced polycythemia vera basophil activation. Finally, we found that the number of circulating CD63(+) basophils was significantly greater in patients suffering from aquagenic pruritus, who also showed a higher V617F allele burden.

Conclusions

These data indicate that the number of constitutively activated and hypersensitive circulating basophils is increased in polycythemia vera, underscoring a role of JAK2V617F in these cells' abnormal function and, putatively, in the pathogenesis of pruritus.
