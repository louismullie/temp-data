## Question

treatment of coronavirual urinary infection

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to treat what is termed "coronavirus urinary infection", covering bacterial UTI in the setting of COVID-19, potential viral cystitis, and COVID-19–associated kidney injury, with practical management steps and citations throughout.

> Clarify the clinical entity and differential. SARS-CoV-2 has renal and bladder tropism through ACE2 expression and can produce lower urinary tract symptoms and kidney injury, while COVID-19 also increases the risk of secondary bacterial UTI, so the term can plausibly encompass bacterial UTI in a patient with COVID-19, viral cystitis–like LUTS, and COVID-19–associated AKI, each requiring distinct evaluation and therapy [^111GsSKh] [^1137oade] [^115WrEEL]. Viral RNA in urine is detected infrequently overall, though higher urine viral loads have correlated with AKI and poor outcomes in some cohorts, emphasizing that urine viral testing has limited diagnostic yield but underscores kidney involvement in severe disease [^112ZjyK9] [^112gbvt9].

> Establish a diagnostic framework. For any suspected urinary infection in a patient with COVID-19, obtain urinalysis with microscopy and urine culture prior to antibiotics, and document pyuria and a uropathogen to confirm bacterial UTI, especially in recurrent presentations, aligning with IDSA, EAU, and AUA guidance [^1141TKM5] [^116gHYk5] [^112ezzEf] [^1123HWuS] [^1123xW8W]. Consider the clinical pattern to differentiate entities: dysuria with pyuria and bacteriuria supports bacterial UTI, LUTS without pyuria or bacteriuria suggests a viral cystitis–like syndrome, and rising creatinine with proteinuria and hematuria should prompt evaluation for COVID-19–associated AKI using KDIGO/ADQI criteria and serial urine output and creatinine monitoring, recognizing the high frequency and prognostic weight of AKI in hospitalized COVID-19 [^115qWVGj] [^112h3jsQ]. Reserve urine SARS-CoV-2 testing for research or unusual scenarios given its low sensitivity and unclear clinical utility [^112ZjyK9].

> Treat confirmed bacterial UTI in a patient with COVID-19 per standard severity-based regimens and culture results while integrating COVID-specific considerations. For uncomplicated cystitis, first-line options remain nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole where susceptible, or fosfomycin per IDSA/ESCMID guidance, avoiding fluoroquinolones when alternatives exist due to collateral damage concerns [^11722jyV]. For complicated pyelonephritis or suspected urosepsis, initiate parenteral therapy promptly with regimens such as an aminopenicillin plus an aminoglycoside, a second- or third-generation cephalosporin plus an aminoglycoside, or an intravenous third-generation cephalosporin as recommended by EAU, and obtain urine and blood cultures prior to antibiotics when feasible [^117CU9Hp] [^114dEX5z]. If the patient is receiving nirmatrelvir/ritonavir for COVID-19, perform a careful medication-interaction review because ritonavir is a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor that can interact with several antimicrobials; use authoritative resources or pharmacist consultation to manage interactions and timing of therapies [^114z7gH7] [^111C3VM4]. Minimize nephrotoxins and adjust doses for renal function given the high AKI risk in COVID-19, and use balanced crystalloids for resuscitation when volume expansion is needed [^115qWVGj] [^1117nXcY]. If a catheter is present, replace or remove it before culture and maintain a closed drainage system to reduce CAUTI risk and improve microbiologic yield [^116gHYk5] [^117SVS32].

> Manage suspected viral cystitis or direct SARS-CoV-2 bladder involvement supportively while treating COVID-19 per current standards. There is no established bladder-directed antiviral therapy; focus on COVID-19 antivirals in eligible high-risk outpatients, with preferred options being nirmatrelvir/ritonavir initiated within 5 days of symptom onset or a 3-day outpatient remdesivir course when feasible, balancing drug–drug interactions and renal function considerations, and counseling that rebound can occur but is typically mild [^111C3VM4] [^114z7gH7] [^113w9284]. Provide symptom relief for frequency, urgency, and bladder discomfort with standard overactive bladder agents as needed, ensure adequate hydration unless restricted for kidney or cardiac reasons, and observe that LUTS often improve over months in longitudinal follow-up cohorts [^1137oade] [^117VWsN7].

> Address COVID-19–associated AKI with guideline-based supportive care and modality choices tailored to the hypercoagulable state. Use balanced crystalloids for volume expansion, avoid nephrotoxins and unnecessary contrast, and treat the underlying COVID-19 per severity and timing, recognizing that AKI is common and strongly associated with mortality in hospitalized patients [^1117nXcY] [^115qWVGj]. When kidney replacement therapy is indicated, favor continuous venovenous hemodialysis or hemodiafiltration to reduce filtration fraction and circuit clotting in COVID-19–associated hypercoagulability, and individualize anticoagulation per institutional protocols [^114FQU7d]. Consider renal biopsy when heavy or atypical proteinuria suggests alternative diagnoses where results would change management [^112X3464].

> Implement special precautions in patients with COVID-19 and urinary issues. Anticipate hypercoagulability that complicates extracorporeal circuits and adapt RRT strategies accordingly, with attention to anticoagulation and modality selection per ADQI consensus [^114FQU7d]. Maintain infection control around urine handling given low but present detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in urine, while acknowledging uncertain infectivity, and preserve closed catheter systems in hospitalized patients to limit CAUTI risk [^112ZjyK9] [^117SVS32]. During resource strain, triage nonurgent urologic care and leverage telehealth to maintain access while preserving capacity for urgent conditions, based on observed system-wide impacts during pandemic surges [^117HJeET] [^112PcTPe] [^115q3UPe].

> Prevent future events where possible through catheter stewardship, recurrent UTI strategies, and COVID-19 risk reduction. Prefer hydrophilic-coated intermittent catheters when appropriate to reduce urethral trauma and UTI risk, maintain closed drainage, and minimize catheter dwell time, with renewed vigilance given CAUTI increases during the pandemic and the effectiveness of focused QI interventions in reducing rates [^112nDrsH] [^117SVS32] [^114epQdr] [^116tB8Wm]. For women with recurrent uncomplicated UTI, consider patient-initiated therapy for acute episodes while cultures are pending, reserve antibiotic prophylaxis for selected patients after shared decision-making, and avoid surveillance urine testing in asymptomatic patients [^112kKQCz] [^114nRxTD] [^115oSPZh]. Encourage up-to-date COVID-19 vaccination and timely outpatient antivirals in high-risk patients to mitigate severe disease that underlies many urinary complications [^111C3VM4] [^117Gqqbf].

> Monitor and follow-up with time horizons matched to illness phase. During the acute phase, track urine output and daily creatinine, reassess urinalysis and culture if urinary symptoms persist beyond 48 hours despite therapy, and monitor for antiviral adverse effects and drug–drug interactions, noting remdesivir's tolerability profile even in renal impairment cohorts [^115qWVGj] [^115eRP1L]. In the post-acute phase, counsel that COVID-associated LUTS often abate over 6–12 months while arranging evaluation for alternate causes if symptoms persist after microbiologic cure, and recognize that a substantial fraction of patients with COVID-19–associated AKI have not recovered by discharge though additional recovery occurs on follow-up, without routine imaging for recurrent uncomplicated UTI unless indicated by guidelines [^117VWsN7] [^111cSTBk] [^115qWVGj] [^111LxDoB]. Escalate care urgently for suspected urosepsis with prompt parenteral antibiotics and source control, for worsening kidney failure requiring nephrology-led RRT, and for progressive COVID-19 needing inpatient antivirals and monitoring [^117J5i6v] [^115ZAhTT] [^114FQU7d] [^111C3VM4].

> Practical synthesis for "coronavirus urinary infection". In patients with COVID-19 and urinary symptoms, first rule in or out bacterial UTI with urinalysis and culture and treat per guideline-based regimens while checking for interactions with COVID-19 antivirals and adjusting for renal function, then consider viral cystitis–like LUTS when cultures are negative and manage supportively while treating COVID-19, and recognize and manage COVID-19–associated AKI early with ADQI-endorsed supportive care and appropriate RRT modalities, all under catheter stewardship and preventive strategies to reduce recurrence and procedure-related infections [^1141TKM5] [^116gHYk5] [^11722jyV] [^117CU9Hp] [^114z7gH7] [^114FQU7d] [^117SVS32] [^112kKQCz] [^115oSPZh].

There is **no evidence** for a distinct "coronaviral urinary infection" as a clinical entity; urinary symptoms in COVID-19 are typically due to indirect effects such as inflammation, AKI [^114FQU7d], or secondary bacterial infection. Management focuses on **supportive care** (hydration, analgesia, bladder-directed therapy) [^1137oade], **standard COVID-19 antivirals** (nirmatrelvir/ritonavir or remdesivir) when indicated [^114z7gH7], and antibiotics only for confirmed bacterial co-infection [^11722jyV]. Monitor for **AKI** with urinalysis [^113SkUFx] and renal function tests, and use continuous RRT if needed in severe cases [^114FQU7d]. There is **no role** for antiviral therapy targeting urinary tract SARS-CoV-2, and no evidence supports corticosteroids or immunomodulators for isolated urinary symptoms.

---

## Clinical presentation and diagnosis

Patients with COVID-19 may present with **urinary symptoms** [^1137oade] such as frequency, urgency, dysuria, hematuria, and proteinuria [^115qWVGj]. These symptoms are typically associated with systemic inflammation, acute kidney injury (AKI) [^114FQU7d], or secondary bacterial infections rather than direct viral infection of the urinary tract [^112ZjyK9].

For **diagnostic evaluation**, the assessment should include:

- **Urinalysis**: Assess for proteinuria, hematuria, and leukocyturia [^113SkUFx].

- **Urine culture**: Rule out bacterial co-infection [^1141TKM5].

- **Renal function tests**: Monitor serum creatinine and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) [^112h3jsQ].

- **PCR testing**: Detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA in urine, although this is infrequently positive and not routinely recommended [^112ZjyK9] [^113SDtAG].

---

## Pathophysiology

SARS-CoV-2 may indirectly affect the urinary tract through systemic inflammation, immune-mediated injury, and endothelial dysfunction [^114FQU7d]. Direct viral invasion of renal tubular cells and podocytes has been documented, contributing to **AKI** and **proteinuria** [^113CZbDB] [^111GsSKh].

---

## Treatment strategies

### Supportive care

Supportive care remains the cornerstone of managing **COVID-19–associated urinary symptoms** [^1137oade]:

- **Hydration**: Maintain adequate fluid intake to prevent dehydration and reduce renal stress.

- **Analgesia**: Use acetaminophen or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) cautiously for symptom relief.

- **Bladder-directed therapy**: Consider anticholinergic medications or beta-3 agonists for significant lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS).

---

### Antiviral therapy

Currently, there is **no specific antiviral therapy** targeting SARS-CoV-2 infection of the urinary tract. However, standard COVID-19 antivirals may indirectly improve urinary symptoms by reducing systemic viral load and inflammation. These include **nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Paxlovid)** for high-risk outpatients within five days of symptom onset [^114z7gH7] [^111C3VM4] and **remdesivir** for hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19, including those with AKI [^115eRP1L].

---

### Antibiotic therapy

Antibiotics are **not indicated for viral infections** but should be administered if bacterial co-infection is confirmed or strongly suspected. When indicated, initiate **empirical therapy** based on the local antibiogram and adjust according to culture results [^1141TKM5]; for **catheter-associated infections**, follow established guidelines for catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTI) [^117CU9Hp].

---

### Management of acute kidney injury (AKI)

AKI is a **common complication** in COVID-19 patients with urinary involvement [^115qWVGj]. Management includes:

- **Fluid management**: Use balanced crystalloids for volume expansion [^1117nXcY].

- **Renal replacement therapy (RRT)**: Consider continuous venovenous hemodialysis or hemodiafiltration in severe cases [^114FQU7d].

- **Avoid nephrotoxins**: Minimize exposure to nephrotoxic medications.

---

## Preventive measures

Preventive strategies focus on reducing the risk of urinary complications in COVID-19 patients through **vaccination** [^115y1PZg], which reduces the severity of systemic illness, thereby indirectly lowering urinary risk. Additional measures include minimizing catheter use with strict aseptic technique to prevent CAUTI [^117SVS32] and regularly monitoring renal function and urinary symptoms in hospitalized patients [^112h3jsQ].

---

## Prognosis and outcomes

The prognosis of urinary involvement in COVID-19 varies depending on the severity of systemic illness and the presence of complications such as AKI. AKI [^114FQU7d] significantly increases **mortality and morbidity** in COVID-19 patients [^115qWVGj]. Most urinary symptoms resolve with supportive care as systemic illness improves, although persistent symptoms may occur in some patients.

---

## Current research and clinical trials

Ongoing research focuses on understanding the **pathophysiology** of SARS-CoV-2-related urinary complications and evaluating potential **therapeutic interventions**. Clinical trials are investigating antiviral therapies, immunomodulators, and supportive care strategies to improve outcomes in COVID-19 patients with urinary involvement [^116yAqXd].

Regarding specific circumstances for acute kidney injury, more specifically with respect to patients with COVID-19-associated AKI, the ADQI 2020 guidelines recommend considering the use of continuous venovenous hemodialysis or continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration. This approach is aimed at decreasing the filtration fraction and reducing the risk of circuit clotting when using continuous RRT in patients with COVID-19-associated AKI, as COVID-19 induces a hypercoagulable state.

### Does COVID-19 cause or worsen LUT dysfunction, what are the mechanisms and possible treatments? ICI-RS 2023 [^1137oade]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2024). High credibility.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and produced a worldwide pandemic in 2020. There have been 770,875,433 confirmed cases and 6,959,316 attributed deaths worldwide until September 19, 2023. The virus can also affect the lower urinary tract (LUT), leading to bladder inflammation and producing lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) in both the acute and chronic phases of the disease.

At the 2023 meeting of the International Consultation on Incontinence-Research Society (ICI-RS), the literature relating to COVID-19 and bladder dysfunction was reviewed. The LUTS reported, as well as the pathophysiology of these bladder symptoms, were the subject of considerable discussion. A number of different topics were discussed including lower LUTS reported in COVID-19, how SARS-CoV-2 may infect and affect the urinary tract, and proposed mechanisms for how viral infection results in new, worsened, and in some cases, persisting LUTS.

The workshop discussed the interaction between the virus and the immune system, covering evidence supporting theories underlying the causes of acute and chronic LUTS related to COVID-19 infection. Research questions for further investigation were suggested and identified.

Considerations for antiviral drug selection

There are key differences in drug effectiveness, profiles of adverse effects, and other factors among the three authorized or approved antiviral medications (nirmatrelvir/ritonavir, remdesivir, molnupiravir) that inform tailored drug selection. Several clinical considerations are outlined below. It is notable that much of the antiviral effectiveness data were generated from studies of unvaccinated populations and/or preceded the contemporary SARS-CoV-2 variant era; real-world data continue to accrue.

- **Major considerations and comparison among United States FDA authorized or approved antivirals to treat COVID-19 in the outpatient setting**: Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir has shown high effectiveness against severe COVID-19 outcomes in older individuals and those with incomplete vaccination. A key consideration in prescribing nirmatrelvir/ritonavir is ensuring careful assessment of possible drug–drug interactions because ritonavir potently affects the activity of multiple cytochrome P450 enzymes; this effect may also endure after drug discontinuation during enzyme regeneration. Several excellent resources are available for point-of-care reference to avoid and reduce clinically important interactions, including those from the University of Liverpool and National Institutes of Health treatment guidelines. Notably, in the United States, licensed pharmacists are permitted to prescribe nirmatrelvir/ritonavir after medication review. Important drug classes to consider include immunosuppressants (e.g. tacrolimus) and antiarrhythmics (e.g. amiodarone).

### Assessing the burden of nondeferrable major uro-oncologic surgery to guide prioritisation strategies during the COVID-19 pandemic: Insights from three Italian high-volume referral centres [^115q3UPe]. European Urology (2020). Low credibility.

The coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to an unprecedented emergency scenario for all aspects of health care, including urology. At the time of writing, Italy was the country with the highest rates of both infection and mortality. A panel of experts recently released recommendations for prioritising urologic surgeries in a low-resource setting. Of note, major cancer surgery represents a compelling challenge. However, the burden of these procedures and the impact of such recommendations on urologic practice are currently unknown. To fill this gap, we assessed the yearly proportion of high-priority major uro-oncologic surgeries at three Italian high-volume academic centres. Of 2387 major cancer surgeries, 32.3% were classified as high priority (12.6% of radical nephroureterectomy, 17.3% of nephrectomy, 33.9% of radical prostatectomy, and 36.2% of radical cystectomy cases). Moreover, 26.4% of high-priority major cancer surgeries were performed in patients at higher perioperative risk (American Society of Anesthesiologists score ≥ 3), with radical cystectomy contributing the most to this cohort (50%). Our real-life data contextualise ongoing recommendations on prioritisation strategies during the COVID-19 pandemic, highlighting the need for better patient selection for surgery. We found that approximately two-thirds of elective major uro-oncologic surgeries can be safely postponed or changed to another treatment modality when the availability of health care resources is reduced.

Patient summary: We used data from three high-volume Italian academic urology centres.

Regarding specific circumstances for catheter-associated urinary tract infection, more specifically with respect to patients with asymptomatic bacteriuria, the IDSA 2010 guidelines recommend diagnosing CA-ASB in male patients with the following conditions:

- **Condom catheter**:
	- Use of a condom catheter.

- **Symptoms and signs**:
	- Absence of symptoms or signs compatible with UTI.

- **Bacterial growth**:
	- Growth ≥ 10⁵ CFU/mL of ≥ 1 bacterial species in a single urine specimen from a freshly applied condom catheter.

### Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on urological care delivery in the United States [^117HJeET]. The Journal of Urology (2021). Low credibility.

Characteristics of the unique patients and practices represented in our sample are summarized in the revised data, which include 13,108,874 total visits and 2,194,456 procedures.

- **Outpatient clinic visits by patient characteristics**: The figure presents the unadjusted trends in outpatient clinic visits from January 2019 through February 2021 for overall, nonurgent diagnoses, potentially urgent diagnoses, new patient visits, and telehealth visits. Overall, there was a similar pattern of a sharp decrease after week 10, followed by a gradual recovery that remained stable through the summer of 2020 to 2021.

	- Weekly average of outpatient clinic visits per practice from January 2019 to February 2021 for:
		- Overall population
		- Select nonurgent diagnoses (microscopic hematuria, overactive bladder, elevated prostate-specific antigen, erectile dysfunction, and BPH)
		- Potentially urgent diagnoses (prostate cancer, bladder cancer, kidney cancer, kidney stones, urinary tract infection, gross hematuria, and renal mass)
		- New patient visits
		- Telephone visits

	- Beginning in March 2020 (week 10), there was a sharp, nearly 50% decrease in total outpatient visits, reaching a nadir in April (week 15). The rebound period stretched from May to June (weeks 16 to 24), reaching 92% of baseline, followed by another decrease, with visits at 77% of baseline. There was a 50.6% decrease in daily outpatient visits at its lowest point, which gradually improved.

### Veklury [^115eRP1L]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The clinical trials experience in adults with COVID-19 and renal impairment was observed in Study GS-US-540–5912. This study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial involving 163 hospitalized subjects with confirmed COVID-19 and acute kidney injury (AKI; N = 60), chronic kidney disease (CKD; eGFR < 30 mL/minute/1.73 m²; N = 44), or end-stage renal disease (ESRD; eGFR < 15 mL/minute/1.73 m²; N = 59) on hemodialysis, who received Veklury for up to 5 days. The adverse reactions observed were consistent with those reported in other clinical trials of Veklury in adults. Adverse reactions (all grades) were reported in 13 (8%) subjects in the Veklury group and 3 (4%) subjects in the placebo group. The most common adverse reactions were nausea (1%), abdominal pain (1%), and diarrhea (1%). No subjects experienced serious adverse reactions. One subject permanently discontinued treatment due to an adverse reaction: increased lipase.

- **Laboratory abnormalities**: The frequencies of laboratory abnormalities (Grades 3–4) occurring in at least 3% of subjects with COVID-19 receiving Veklury in Trial GS-US-540–5912 are presented in Table 13.

### High SARS-CoV-2 viral load in urine sediment correlates with acute kidney injury and poor COVID-19 outcome [^112gbvt9]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2021). Low credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a complication of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that is associated with high mortality. Despite documented kidney tropism of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), there are no consistent reports of viral detection in urine or correlation with AKI or COVID-19 severity. Here, we hypothesize that quantification of the viral load of SARS-CoV-2 in urine sediment from patients with COVID-19 correlates with the occurrence of AKI and mortality.

- **Methods**: The viral load of SARS-CoV-2 in urine sediments (U-viral load) was quantified by qRT-PCR in 52 patients with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 diagnoses, who were hospitalized between March 15 and June 8, 2020. Immunolabeling of SARS-CoV-2 proteins Spike and Nucleocapsid was performed in two COVID-19 kidney biopsy specimens and urine sediments. Viral infectivity assays were performed from 32 urine sediments.

- **Results**: A total of 20 patients with COVID-19 (39%) had detectable SARS-CoV-2 U-viral load, of which 17 (85%) developed AKI with an average U-viral load four-times higher than patients with COVID-19 who did not have AKI. U-viral load was highest (7.7-fold) within 2 weeks after AKI diagnosis. A higher U-viral load correlated with mortality but not with albuminuria or AKI stage. SARS-CoV-2 proteins partially colocalized with the viral receptor ACE2 in kidney biopsy specimens in tubules and parietal cells, and in urine sediment cells. Infective SARS-CoV-2 was not detected in urine sediments.

- **Conclusion**: Our results further support SARS-CoV-2 kidney tropism. A higher SARS-CoV-2 viral load in urine sediment is linked to poor outcomes.

### Triaging urological surgeries to cope with the coronavirus-19 pandemic [^113vjLSe]. Current Opinion in Urology (2022). Low credibility.

The coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to strains on hospital resources and difficulties in safely and effectively triaging surgical procedures. In this article, we discuss the important considerations for triaging urologic surgeries during a global pandemic, mitigating factors for performing surgeries safely, and general guidelines for specific surgeries.

Many urological procedures have been reduced due to the pandemic, with benign disease states being most affected, whereas oncology cases are affected the least. Recommendations in urology triage prioritize life-threatening conditions or conditions that may lead to life-threatening ailments for treatment during the pandemic. Additionally, published recommendations suggest that all surgical patients be screened for COVID-19 to protect staff, prevent disease dissemination, and educate patients about the worse outcomes that can occur if infected with COVID-19 in the postoperative period.

COVID-19 has caused worldwide shortages of healthcare resources and increased the need to ethically triage resources to adequately treat the urologic community. These resource limitations have led to increased wait times and cancellations of many urology surgeries considered 'elective'.

### Keytruda [^112zaQx6]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Adverse reactions leading to the interruption of Keytruda occurred in 43% of patients; the most common adverse reactions (≥ 2%) were anemia (8%), COVID-19 (6%), SARS-CoV-2 test positive (3.1%), decreased neutrophil count (2.7%), diarrhea (2.7%), urinary tract infection (2.7%), and increased ALT (2.4%).

Tables summarizing adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities in patients on Keytruda in KEYNOTE-A18 were referenced, although the tables themselves are not included here.

The safety of Keytruda in combination with paclitaxel and cisplatin, or paclitaxel and carboplatin, with or without bevacizumab, was investigated in KEYNOTE-826. This multicenter, double-blind, randomized (1:1), placebo-controlled trial studied patients with persistent, recurrent, or first-line metastatic cervical cancer who had not been treated with chemotherapy except when used concurrently as a radio-sensitizing agent [see Clinical Studies (14.12)]. A total of 616 patients, regardless of tumor PD-L1 expression, received Keytruda 200 mg and chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab (n = 307) every 3 weeks, or placebo and chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab (n = 309) every 3 weeks.

### Incidence rates and management of urinary tract infections among children in Dutch general practice: Results from a nation-wide registration study [^113BbBpx]. BMC Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

The frequency of urinary tract infections in relation to age and gender, as well as diagnostic procedures and treatment, was investigated in several studies. However, little is known about seasonal variation and urbanization. Seasonal variations in the incidence of human disease are commonplace, but in the case of urinary tract infections, this aspect has rarely been addressed. Therefore, our first aim is to describe the incidence rates of urinary tract infections among children in Dutch general practice in 2001 by age, gender, and in relation to season and urbanization level. It is important to know if there is a relation between these factors and urinary tract infections because this could provide general practitioners with information about patients in whom they should be more alert for urinary tract infections. In addition, we are interested in whether general practitioners follow the clinical guideline for urinary tract infections with respect to prescription and referral.

### Using dipstick urinalysis to predict development of acute kidney injury in patients with COVID-19 [^113SkUFx]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Low credibility.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread rapidly across the globe, causing a worldwide pandemic associated with high morbidity and mortality in affected patients. Although primarily affecting the lungs, COVID-19 may also injure other organ systems. Kidney involvement is common and may range from isolated proteinuria to severe acute kidney injury (AKI). While the exact mechanism by which the virus induces kidney damage remains unclear, several processes have been postulated including direct viral invasion of tubular epithelia, podocyte damage, cytokine storm, and complement activation. AKI is a major risk factor for mortality in patients hospitalized with COVID-19.

Simple predictive models that use readily available kidney laboratory parameters, such as urinary dipstick results and serum creatinine, are lacking. Such models would not only allow clinicians to easily prognosticate the development of AKI and the need for renal replacement therapy (RRT) but may also provide insight into the pathophysiology of AKI associated with COVID-19.

Although several studies reported proteinuria and hematuria in conjunction with COVID-19 infection, only a few evaluated differences in the incidence of proteinuria and hematuria on dipstick urinalysis in patients with AKI as compared to those without AKI. Even fewer studies investigated the association between proteinuria and hematuria with development of AKI and need for RRT. One study reported that a urine protein-to-creatinine ratio (UPCR) ≥ 1 g/g on admission was associated with an increased risk of requiring RRT.

### Kidney involvement in COVID-19 and its treatments [^114Pw4pC]. Journal of Medical Virology (2021). Low credibility.

The lungs are the most commonly affected organ by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), but the kidneys are also frequently affected. Infection with SARS-CoV-2 can not only cause new kidney damage but also increase the difficulty of treatment and care, as well as mortality for people with underlying kidney diseases. Kidney involvement in SARS-CoV-2 infection mainly manifests as kidney tubular injury. Proteinuria is the main clinical sign. To reduce patient mortality, kidney complications should be given increased attention in the diagnosis and treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This study reviews the existing literature and discusses COVID-19 infection in combination with kidney diseases in terms of kidney damage, pathogenesis, and treatment to guide clinical anti-epidemic responses.

### Urinary frequency as a possibly overlooked symptom in COVID-19 patients: Does SARS-CoV-2 cause viral cystitis [^1163QzT9]. European Urology (2020). Low credibility.

The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a challenge for physicians in triaging patients in emergency rooms. We found a potentially dangerous overlap of classical urinary symptoms and the as-yet not fully described symptoms of COVID-19. After a patient was primarily triaged as a urosepsis case and then subsequently diagnosed with COVID-19, we focused on an increase in urinary frequency as a symptom of COVID-19 and identified this in seven males out of 57 patients currently being treated in our COVID-19 wards. In the absence of any other causes, urinary frequency may be secondary to viral cystitis due to underlying COVID-19 disease. We propose consideration of urinary frequency as an anamnestic tool in patients with infective symptoms to increase awareness among urologists during the COVID-19 pandemic to prevent fatal implications of misinterpreting urological symptoms.

### Human kidney is a target for novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection [^111GsSKh]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

The pathology of SARS-CoV-2 infection results from both direct and indirect injury. Direct injury is caused by the infection of target cells by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, while indirect injury mainly results from immune responses, circulatory dysfunction, and hypoxia. In the kidney, ACE2 is highly expressed in the brush border of proximal tubular cells and, to a lesser extent, in podocytes, but not in glomerular endothelial and mesangial cells. Using immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescent double staining, we showed that both SARS-CoV-2 viral NP and S antigens accumulated in ACE2+ kidney tubules (Fig. 3b). SARS-CoV-2 is a cytopathic virus that can directly induce renal tubular injury during infection and replication. Interestingly, we found that SARS-CoV-2 NP and S antigens co-express with DP2 and PDS in kidney tubules, and the expression of DP2 and PDS increased following SARS-CoV-2 infection (Fig. 4b), suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 directly initiates hypoxic damage in infected kidney tubules.

On the other hand, although host immune cells can infiltrate infected tissue to counteract viral replication, hyperactivation of immune cells may instead promote fibrosis, induce epithelial cell apoptosis, and cause microvasculature changes. We report that the SARS-CoV-2 virus recruits high levels of CD68+ macrophages to infiltrate the tubulointerstitium (Fig. 5a), suggesting that macrophages could induce tubular damage.

### Your outpatient has coronavirus disease 2019: What are the treatment options in the current severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 variant climate [^111C3VM4]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

- **Clinical case revisited**: Therapeutic decision-making for a 71-year-old male kidney transplant recipient with confirmed COVID-19. Assess risk for severe COVID-19. The patient has many risk factors for severe COVID-19 including older age, multiple comorbidities (obesity, diabetes, renal dysfunction), and transplant immunosuppression. Although the patient has received the CDC-recommended 3-dose primary mRNA vaccine series, he has not received a booster, and the combination of potential blunted initial immune response coupled with waning immunity places him at elevated risk for COVID-19. Prior receipt of tixagevimab and cilgavimab prophylaxis should not affect treatment decisions given this combination is not active against contemporary Omicron sublineages. Overall, guidelines recommend prompt antiviral therapy.

- **Assess symptoms and severity**: The patient currently notes upper respiratory symptoms and malaise, without evidence of a severe syndrome or decompensation that would indicate the need for urgent inpatient evaluation and management. Additionally, he reports 3 days of symptoms, which places him in an early window to receive any of the authorized or approved antiviral therapies; the US FDA EUA restrictions continue to require treatment initiation within 5 days of symptoms for oral antivirals.

- **Tailor drug selection**: Among available medications, remdesivir and nirmatrelvir/ritonavir have shown the highest effectiveness against severe COVID-19 and are thus preferred therapies for this high-risk outpatient. If remdesivir infusion is available, this may be given over the next several days, without the need for immediate hospitalization.

### Safe provision of systemic anti-cancer treatment for urological cancer patients during COVID-19: a tertiary centre experience in the first wave of COVID-19 [^114P3bHo]. BMC Urology (2022). Low credibility.

Safe provision of systemic anti-cancer treatment (SACT) during the COVID-19 pandemic remains an ongoing concern amongst clinicians.

- **Methods**: Retrospective analysis on uro-oncology patients who continued or started SACT between 1st March and 31st May 2020 during the pandemic (with 2019 as a comparator).

- **Results**: 441 patients received SACT in 2020 (292 prostate, 101 renal, 38 urothelial, 10 testicular) compared to 518 patients in 2019 (340 prostate, 121 renal, 42 urothelial, 15 testicular). In 2020, there were 75.00% fewer patients with stage 3 cancers receiving SACT (p < 0.0001) and 94.44% fewer patients receiving radical treatment (p = 0.00194). The number of patients started on a new line of SACT was similar between both years (118 in 2019 vs 102 in 2020; p = 0.898) but with 53.45% fewer patients started on chemotherapy in 2020 (p < 0.001). Overall, 5 patients tested positive for COVID-19 (one asymptomatic, one mild, two moderate, one severe resulting in death). Compared to 2019, 30-day mortality was similar (1.69% in 2019 vs 0.98% in 2020; p = 0.649) whereas 6-month mortality was lower (9.32% in 2019 vs 1.96% in 2020; p = 0.0209) in 2020.

- **Conclusion**: This study suggests that delivery of SACT to uro-oncology patients during COVID-19 pandemic may be safe in high-incidence areas with appropriate risk-reduction strategies.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is unlike anything seen before by modern science-based medicine. Health systems across the world are struggling to manage it. Added to this struggle are the effects of social confinement and isolation, which brings into question whether the latest guidelines are relevant in this crisis. We aim to support urologists in this difficult situation by providing tools that can facilitate decision-making and minimize the impact and risks for both patients and health professionals delivering urological care, whenever possible. We hope that the revised recommendations will assist urologist surgeons across the globe to guide the management of urological conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic.

COVID-19 "rebound" syndromes

Recurrence of COVID-19 symptoms after initial improvement (i.e. "rebound") may occur during SARS-CoV-2 infection, at times accompanied by repeat positive molecular testing, high viral loads, and isolation of cultivable live virus. The precise frequency of rebound syndromes and impact of antiviral therapy (such as nirmatrelvir/ritonavir) is unclear, particularly among vaccinated individuals in the Omicron variant era. Although underlying mechanisms remain uncertain, rebound syndromes do not appear to be primarily driven by acquired drug resistance. Notably, early clinical trials of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir reported low and similar rates of virological rebound across placebo and treatment groups (2%–7% vs. 2%–4%, varying by rebound definition). In contrast, more contemporary, less controlled observational reports have reported higher incidence with nirmatrelvir/ritonavir use (> 10%). Across studies, however, rebound syndromes occurring following antiviral therapy do not appear associated with severe illness and/or need for hospitalization. This in part underlies CDC recommendations to isolate if symptoms consistent with COVID-19 return following antiviral treatment, though no additional therapeutic interventions are currently recommended.

### Rituxan [^115ELYg1]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

In the pooled, placebo-controlled studies, 39% of patients in the Rituxan group experienced an infection of any type compared to 34% of patients in the placebo group. The most common infections were nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infections, urinary tract infections, bronchitis, and sinusitis.

The incidence of serious infections was 2% in the Rituxan-treated patients and 1% in the placebo group. In the experience with Rituxan in 2,578 RA patients, the rate of serious infections was 4.31 per 100 patient years. The most common serious infections (greater than or equal to 0.5%) were pneumonia or lower respiratory tract infections, cellulitis, and urinary tract infections. Fatal serious infections included pneumonia, sepsis, and colitis. Rates of serious infection remained stable in patients receiving subsequent courses. In 185 Rituxan-treated RA patients with active disease, subsequent treatment with a biologic DMARD, the majority of which were TNF antagonists, did not appear to increase the rate of serious infection. Thirteen serious infections were observed in 186.1 patient years (6.99 per 100 patient years) prior to exposure, and 10 were observed in 182.3 patient years (5.49 per 100 patient years) after exposure.

- **Cardiovascular adverse reactions**: In the pooled, placebo-controlled studies, the proportion of patients with serious cardiovascular reactions was 1.7% and 1.3% in the Rituxan and placebo treatment groups, respectively. Three cardiovascular deaths occurred during the double-blind period of the RA studies, including all rituximab regimens.

### Systematic review and subgroup analysis of the incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) in patients with COVID-19 [^112XQNhw]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Low credibility.

In this systematic review, the results from 22 retrospective cross-sectional studies, including 16,199 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 from 1 January 2020 to 1 June 2020, demonstrated that AKI was not rare in COVID-19 patients. Our subgroup analyses suggest that the incidence of AKI might be associated with age, disease severity, and ethnicity.

COVID-19 is primarily a respiratory disease; however, other organs, including the kidneys, are often involved. SARS-CoV-2 enters cells via the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and is highly homologous to SARS-CoV. High ACE2 expression in proximal tubular epithelial cells may make the kidneys a potential target, leading to kidney injury. Renal abnormalities, such as proteinuria, haematuria, and AKI, occur in patients with COVID-19. AKI is characterized by a rapid increase in serum creatinine, a decrease in urine output, or both. The widely used AKI definition was developed by the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) group in 2012. The most common causes of AKI are septic shock, major surgery, cardiogenic shock, drug toxicity, and hypovolemia.

The cause of AKI in COVID-19 patients is likely to be multifactorial, including a direct attack by SARS-CoV-2 or factors such as haemodynamic instability, microcirculatory dysfunction, tubular cell injury, renal congestion, microvascular thrombi, and endothelial dysfunction, which are commonly found in critically ill patients.

### Chronic kidney disease linked to SARS-CoV-2 infection: A case report [^116tWd9W]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Low credibility.

Since December 2019, the COVID-19 pandemic has become a major public health issue worldwide and the source of substantial healthcare costs. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-related Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) belongs to the Sarbecovirus subgenus along with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-related Coronavirus-1 (SARS-CoV-1). SARS-CoV-2 possesses a large spectrum of virulence, varying from asymptomatic infection to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and multi-organ failure linked to cytokine storm, with possible Kawasaki-like syndromes and autoimmune manifestations linked to interleukin 6 (IL-6) hypersecretion.

Autopsy case series have shown several types of lesions linked to SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially alveolar damage with viral replication in pneumocytes, but also viral replication in the kidneys with podocyte and proximal tubular involvement. Acute kidney injury has also been associated with severe COVID-19 infection and increased in-hospital mortality. SARS-CoV-2 mainly uses the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE2) as an entry point into infected cells prior to protein priming by transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2). Blood group antigen polymorphisms might also modulate virus binding and infectivity, as individuals with blood group A and B are potentially more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infections. Epidemiological studies recently illustrated the association between SARS-CoV-2, severe renal dysfunction, and the occurrence of chronic comorbidities. Here, we demonstrate the occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 chronic replication in the kidney of a comorbid.

### Your outpatient has coronavirus disease 2019: What are the treatment options in the current severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 variant climate [^115y1PZg]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Low credibility.

- **Approach to therapeutic decision-making**: Assess risk for severe COVID-19. Initial clinical decision-making includes an assessment of risk for COVID-19 outcomes such as hospitalization, critical illness, and death, which is driven by several key demographic and immunologic factors (Figure 1). The most important nonmodifiable risk factor for severe outcomes is older age, particularly age ≥ 65 years. Accumulating medical comorbidities such as obesity, diabetes, and chronic organ dysfunction (renal, lung, or liver disease) also increase risk. The key modifiable factor to decrease COVID-19 risk is SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, in particular booster vaccination, which dramatically reduces the incidence of severe disease in older individuals. Importantly, an increasing degree of immunocompromise contributes not only to an impaired ability to fend off viral infections but may also attenuate the response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination.

- **Assess syndrome (severity and duration)**: Individuals with evidence of severe and progressive COVID-19, as with other causes of pneumonia, warrant urgent evaluation in the appropriate care setting. Signs and symptoms may include the presence of lower respiratory complaints such as severe dyspnea, especially when accompanied by hypoxia, ongoing high fevers, and/or lethargy. For those with milder symptoms that are appropriate for management in the outpatient setting, symptom duration impacts the appropriateness of available antiviral medications. Specifically, oral drugs such as nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Paxlovid) and molnupiravir (Lagevrio) must be prescribed within 5 days of symptom onset.

### Secretion of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in urine [^112ZjyK9]. Current Opinion in Urology (2020). Low credibility.

Despite the plethora of publications discussing the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), evidence of viral secretion in urine is sparse.

Recent findings identify 34 publications, including a total of 2,172 patients. Among these, 549 patients were tested for SARS-CoV-2 secretion in urine, which was detected in only 38 patients (6.9%). Within the seven studies displaying positive results, the majority of positive patients (86.8%) were from studies not yet peer-reviewed, showing weak data and heterogeneous techniques for sample testing. Furthermore, none of the studies available in the literature addressed the virulence of detected viral RNA in urine.

Overall, only seven studies were able to detect SARS-CoV-2 secretion in urine, all with a considerably low rate of positivity. However, these studies were of rather low quality, considering their methodology. Despite this, as SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in urine, it is important to discuss safety and urinary hygiene protocols. Until further research provides valid data on viral shedding and virulence in urine, the potential risk of transmission through urine cannot be ruled out. Therefore, safety and hygiene measures need to be discussed.

### Safe provision of systemic anti-cancer treatment for urological cancer patients during COVID-19: a tertiary centre experience in the first wave of COVID-19 [^117KSjaQ]. BMC Urology (2022). Low credibility.

This single-centre retrospective study demonstrated that patients could receive a range of SACT during COVID-19 with a low incidence of infection rate and mortality. Although shifts in the type of SACT delivered were observed, with less chemotherapy administered, we were able to continue to start patients on SACT. With emerging new variants and easing of national lockdown measures, we hope that our data provides reassurance that SACT can be safely delivered during a pandemic with appropriate safety provisions in place. Furthermore, strategies should also include stringent vaccination programs for patients with cancer, considering the availability of COVID-19 vaccines and emerging data on its reduced efficacy in this population.

### Covid-19-associated acute kidney injury: Consensus report of the 25th Acute Disease Quality Initiative (ADQI) Workgroup [^111ErRGL]. Nature Reviews Nephrology (2020). Low credibility.

Kidney involvement in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is common and can range from the presence of proteinuria and haematuria to acute kidney injury (AKI) requiring renal replacement therapy (RRT; also known as kidney replacement therapy). COVID-19-associated AKI (COVID-19 AKI) is associated with high mortality and serves as an independent risk factor for all-cause in-hospital death in patients with COVID-19. The pathophysiology and mechanisms of AKI in patients with COVID-19 have not been fully elucidated and seem to be multifactorial, aligning with the pathophysiology of AKI in other critically ill patients.

Little is known about the prevention and management of COVID-19 AKI. The emergence of regional 'surges' in COVID-19 cases can limit hospital resources, including dialysis availability and supplies; thus, a careful daily assessment of available resources is needed. In this Consensus Statement, the Acute Disease Quality Initiative provides recommendations for the diagnosis, prevention, and management of COVID-19 AKI based on the literature. We also make recommendations for areas of future research aimed at improving understanding of the underlying processes and improving outcomes for patients with COVID-19 AKI.

### Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on urological care delivery in the United States [^112PcTPe]. The Journal of Urology (2021). Low credibility.

Outpatient clinic visits declined substantially for all of the 12 most common urological diagnoses and decreased more for nonurgent diagnoses compared with other diagnoses. Outpatient visits for prostate, bladder, and kidney cancer diagnoses saw a 38%–44% decrease in volume during the height of the pandemic, compared to a 54%–59% decrease in visits for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) or microscopic hematuria. This was followed by a fast recovery period where outpatient visits were 6%–15% higher than baseline levels for prostate, bladder, and kidney cancer diagnoses. However, as of February 2021, the volume of outpatient visits was still about 17%–19% lower than pre-pandemic values in February 2020. Although outpatient visits for benign indications such as benign prostatic hyperplasia, erectile dysfunction, and overactive bladder decreased during the peak of the pandemic (49%–54%), outpatient visit rates in February 2021 were close to pre-pandemic levels (5%–12% lower).

- **Trends in procedures**: Frequency of inpatient and outpatient surgical procedures during the lockdown and subsequent reopening phases varied. Procedures for benign conditions, such as vasectomy, transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP), and urodynamics, decreased 68%–78% during the height of the pandemic in lockdown. The recovery for vasectomy increased to about 20% above pre-pandemic numbers, whereas other benign procedures had a more blunted response.

### Is coronavirus disease 2019 associated with indicators of long-term bladder dysfunction [^111wJt86]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2021). Low credibility.

Early reports have suggested that coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can present with significant urinary frequency and nocturia, and that these symptoms correlate with markers of inflammation in the urine. We evaluated surrogate markers of chronic urinary symptoms to determine if they were more frequent after COVID-19 infection.

- **Objective**: Early reports have suggested that coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can present with significant urinary frequency and nocturia, and that these symptoms correlate with markers of inflammation in the urine. We evaluated surrogate markers of chronic urinary symptoms to determine if they were more frequent after COVID-19 infection.

- **Methods**: Routinely collected data from the province of Ontario was used to conduct a matched, retrospective cohort study. We identified patients 66 years of age or older who had a positive COVID-19 test between February and May 2020 and survived at least 2 months after their diagnosis. We matched them to two similar patients who did not have a positive COVID-19 test during the same time period. We measured the frequency of urology consultation, cystoscopy, and new prescriptions for overactive bladder medications during a subsequent 3-month period. Proportional hazard models were adjusted for any baseline differences between the groups.

- **Results**: We matched 5617 patients with COVID-19 to 11,225 people who did not have COVID-19. The groups were similar, aside from a higher proportion of patients having hypertension and diabetes in the COVID-19 cohort. There was no significantly increased hazard of new receipt of overactive bladder medication (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.04, p = 0.88), urology consultation (HR: 1.40, p = 0.10), or cystoscopy (HR: 1.14, p = 0.50) among patients who had COVID-19 compared to the matched cohort.

- **Conclusion**: Surrogate markers of potential bladder dysfunction were not significantly increased in the 2–5 months after COVID-19.

### The COVID-19 pandemic - what have urologists learned [^116LhNSk]. Nature Reviews Urology (2022). Low credibility.

On 11 March 2020, the WHO declared the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak a pandemic, and COVID-19 emerged as one of the biggest challenges in public health and the economy in the twenty-first century. The respiratory tract has been the center of attention, but COVID-19-associated complications affecting the genitourinary tract are reported frequently, raising concerns about possible long-term damage to these organs. The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, which plays a central role in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) invasion, is highly expressed in the genitourinary tract, indicating that these organs could be at high risk of cell damage.

Although the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in urine and semen is very rare, COVID-19 can manifest through urological symptoms and complications, including acute kidney injury (AKI), severe structural changes in testes, impairment of spermatogenesis, and hormonal imbalances, mostly secondary hypogonadism. AKI is associated with poor survival. The effect of altered total testosterone levels or androgen deprivation therapy on the survival of patients with COVID-19 was intensively debated at the beginning of the pandemic. However, androgen inhibition did not show any effect in preventing or treating COVID-19 in a clinical study. Thus, urologists have a crucial role in detecting and managing damage to the genitourinary tract caused by COVID-19.

### Impact of Covid-19 on management of urogynaecology patients: A rapid review of the literature [^113cswjY]. International Urogynecology Journal (2021). Low credibility.

Coronavirus (COVID-19), caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, was first declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11, 2020. Since then, it has continued to rapidly spread worldwide, impacting all aspects of life, including medical care and how clinicians assess and treat patients. Medical providers worldwide have been required to adapt and streamline services to minimize unwarranted, multiple healthcare facility attendances and patient contact where possible by conducting remote consultations, delaying non-urgent visits, and optimizing the provision of one-stop services.

The urogynaecology scope of practice involves, to a significant proportion, the care and management of elderly and vulnerable patients. Therefore, these measures are of particular importance. As the pandemic continues, national and international societies and organizations have published guidance for management mainly based on consensus and expert advice, given that the evidence base to support recommendations is still scarce.

Rapid reviews are a method of knowledge or evidence synthesis to produce information more timely than traditional systematic reviews; therefore, they are particularly useful for new and emerging topics. Rapid reviews involve an expedited process with omission of certain steps usually performed in a systematic review.

Given the rapid evolution of evidence, recommendations, policies, and clinical management adaptations, a rapid review on the evidence and recommendations is highly warranted. Since the COVID-19 pandemic was declared, several…

### Renal implications of coronavirus disease 2019: Insights into viral tropism and clinical outcomes [^116yAqXd]. Current Opinion in Microbiology (2024). Low credibility.

In recent years, multiple coronaviruses have emerged, with the latest one, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), causing a global pandemic. Besides respiratory symptoms, some patients experienced extrapulmonary effects, such as cardiac damage or renal injury, indicating the broad tropism of SARS-CoV-2. The ability of the virus to effectively invade the renal cellular environment can eventually cause tissue-specific damage and disease. Indeed, patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 exhibited a variety of symptoms, such as acute proximal tubular injury, ischemic collapse, and severe acute tubular necrosis resulting in irreversible kidney failure. This review summarizes the knowledge on how it is believed that SARS-CoV-2 influences the renal environment and induces kidney disease, as well as therapy approaches.

### SARS-CoV-2 infection correlates with male benign prostatic hyperplasia deterioration [^115WrEEL]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) affects extra-respiratory systems, with small-scale studies showing worsened male lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) after coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This study explores the correlation between SARS-CoV-2 infection and male benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) complications using large-scale real-world data.

- **Materials and methods**: All male patients attending the public healthcare system in Hong Kong and receiving alpha-blocker monotherapy for LUTS from 2021 to 2022 were included in this study. Patients with and without a positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for SARS-CoV-2 were selected as the exposure group and control group, respectively. Baseline characteristics were retrieved, with propensity score matching performed to ensure the balance of covariates between the two groups. BPH complications were then compared, and subgroup analyses were performed.

- **Results**: After propensity score matching, 17,986 patients were included for analysis, among which half had PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (n = 8993). Compared to the controls, the SARS-CoV-2 group demonstrated a statistically significant higher incidence of retention of urine (4.55% vs. 0.86%, p < 0.001), haematuria (1.36% vs. 0.41%, p < 0.001), clinical urinary tract infection (UTI) (4.31% vs. 1.49%, p < 0.001), culture-proven bacteriuria (9.02% vs. 1.97%, p < 0.001), and the addition of 5ARI (0.50% vs. 0.02%, p < 0.001). Subgroup analysis demonstrated similar differences across different age groups. There are no statistically significant differences in other analyzed variables.

### Coronavirus disease 2019: Coronaviruses and kidney injury [^114AwD1a]. The Journal of Urology (2020). Low credibility.

The first case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was identified and confirmed in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. COVID-19 is gradually posing a serious threat to global public health. In this review, the characteristics and mechanism of kidney injury caused by SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 infection are summarized and contrasted. In particular, urine-oral transmission, prevention, and management of the kidney injury caused by SARS-CoV-2 are emphasized.

- **Materials and methods**: We searched PubMed® for English language articles published since 2003 with the keywords "SARS", "MERS", "COVID-19", or "kidney injury". ClinicalTrials.gov was queried for ongoing studies. We also used relevant data from websites, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.

- **Results**: Similar to two other coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 caused severe respiratory syndrome with rapid progression and kidney injury. The infection process of SARS-CoV-2 is mediated by specifically binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. Cases of COVID-19 combined with kidney impairment are associated with a higher risk of mortality than those without comorbidities. The pathological changes of the kidney are mainly due to local SARS-CoV-2 replication or indirectly by a pro-inflammatory cytokine response. In addition, studies have confirmed the isolation of infectious SARS-CoV-2 in urine, raising the possibility of urine-oral transmission. This is significant for preventing potential urine-oral transmission.

### SARS-CoV-2 infection increases risk of acute kidney injury in a bimodal age distribution [^1158mnHk]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Low credibility.

The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has killed more than 2.7 million people as of March 2021. Infection leads to a wide clinical spectrum, ranging from asymptomatic to severe multi-organ failure and death. Kidney involvement is increasingly recognized as an important complication of SARS-CoV-2 infection, resulting in proteinuria, hematuria, and acute kidney injury (AKI). Kidney involvement is theorized to parallel the severity of the disease and associated common risk factors including hypoperfusion, ischemia, and nephrotoxins. Another hypothesis for kidney sequelae is related to the virus's affinity for the ACE2 receptor, which is densely present in the kidney.

SARS-CoV-2-related AKI has been reported in 25–60% of those critically ill, including up to 37% of critically ill children. AKI has been associated with worse outcomes in those with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2. Initially, adult hospitals saw a rapid rise in the need for acute dialysis during COVID-19 waves, yet this was not observed in pediatric hospitals. Overall, children seem less susceptible to infection and severe disease. Therefore, one hypothesis proposes that lower rates of AKI/dialysis needs in children is a function of disease severity. An assessment of SARS-CoV-2-related AKI across the age spectrum has not been previously reported.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the incidence and epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2-related AKI across the age spectrum and determine if age is an independent risk factor for AKI development in patients hospitalized with SARS-CoV-2.

### AKI in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 [^115qWVGj]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2021). Low credibility.

Early reports indicate that AKI is common among patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and is associated with worse outcomes. However, AKI among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in the United States is not well described.

- **Methods**: This retrospective, observational study involved a review of data from electronic health records of patients aged ≥ 18 years with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 admitted to the Mount Sinai Health System from February 27 to May 30, 2020. We describe the frequency of AKI and dialysis requirement, AKI recovery, and adjusted odds ratios (aORs) with mortality.

- **Results**: Of 3993 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, AKI occurred in 1835 (46%) patients; 347 (19%) of the patients with AKI required dialysis. The proportions with stages 1, 2, or 3 AKI were 39%, 19%, and 42%, respectively. A total of 976 (24%) patients were admitted to intensive care, and 745 (76%) experienced AKI. Of the 435 patients with AKI and urine studies, 84% had proteinuria, 81% had hematuria, and 60% had leukocyturia. Independent predictors of severe AKI were CKD, males, and higher serum potassium at admission. In-hospital mortality was 50% among patients with AKI versus 8% among those without AKI (aOR, 9.2; 95% confidence interval, 7.5 to 11.3). Of survivors with AKI who were discharged, 35% had not recovered to baseline kidney function by the time of discharge. An additional 28 of 77 (36%) patients who had not recovered kidney function at discharge did so on posthospital follow-up.

- **Conclusions**: AKI is common among patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality.

Regarding medical management for acute cystitis, specifically in terms of antibiotic therapy, the ESCMID/IDSA 2011 guidelines recommend reserving fluoroquinolones — such as ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and levofloxacin — as alternative options for acute cystitis. This recommendation is due to the potential for these antibiotics to cause collateral damage.

### Acute kidney injury in COVID-19: Are kidneys the target or just collateral damage? A comprehensive assessment of viral RNA and AKI rate in patients with COVID-19 [^113SDtAG]. Current Opinion in Urology (2021). Low credibility.

To investigate the possible effects of severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on kidney function, this study assessed the rate of viral ribonucleic acid (RNA) shedding and detection in urine.

Recent findings suggest that our current ability to determine whether SARS-CoV-2 directly causes acute kidney injury (AKI) or whether it merely induces AKI by triggering a cytokine storm is limited. In a prospective assessment of 333 patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), an AKI frequency of 9.6% (32 cases) was observed.

Despite previous data suggesting the possibility of detecting SARS-CoV-2 in urine, no traces of messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) were identified in the urine samples of this study group. Both the severity of COVID-19 (odds ratio, OR = 23.09, confidence interval, CI 7.89–67.57, P < 0.001) and a history of chronic kidney disease (CKD) (OR = 7.17, CI 2.09–24.47, P = 0.002) were associated with the observed rate of AKI.

In summary, AKI is a relatively common condition among patients with COVID-19 and tends to be correlated with the severity of the disease and the patient's history of CKD. The available data do not provide evidence of the presence of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA in urine. However, this prospective trial data suggest that mRNA is undetectable in urine, regardless of the severity of the disease.

**Pathophysiology and effects of treatment**: Direct pathogenic mechanisms have been implicated in COVID-19 AKI. Histopathological data are limited, yet various pathological findings have been described in patients with COVID-19, suggesting multiple causes of AKI, including those commonly found in critically ill patients. SARS-CoV-2 may exhibit viral tropism, directly impacting the kidney. Endothelial dysfunction, coagulopathy, and complement activation are significant mechanisms contributing to AKI in a subset of COVID-19 patients. The role of systemic inflammation and immune dysfunction in the development of COVID-19 AKI remains uncertain.

### Review of catheter-associated urinary tract infections and urinary tract models [^115uLR6i]. Journal of Healthcare Engineering (2018). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CA-UTI):

- **Definition**: CA-UTI is a common hospital-acquired infection characterized by various medical complications such as catheter encrustation, bladder stones, septicemia, endotoxic shock, and pyelonephritis.

- **Pathophysiology**: Colonization of the urinary catheter and/or uroepithelial cells, evasion of host defenses, replication, and damage to host cells by uropathogens are involved in the development of CA-UTI. Common microbiological agents include *E. coli, P. mirabilis, P. aeruginosa, S. aureus, S. epidermidis, K. pneumoniae, P. vulgaris, C. freundii, Providentia rettgeri*, and *C. albicans*.

- **Disease course**: Clinical manifestations include fever, urethritis, cystitis, acute pyelonephritis, renal scarring, calculus formation, and bacteremia. Disease progression may lead to urosepsis and death.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Several studies report an association between catheter-associated infection, increased mortality, and prolonged length of stay in acute care facilities.

### Urogenital system damaging manifestations of 3 human infected coronaviruses [^111jU2Db]. The Journal of Urology (2021). Low credibility.

At present, there are no comparative studies on the damage of the three coronavirus infections to the urinary system. Therefore, we reviewed the correlations and differences between invading mechanisms and resultant urogenital system damage by these three kinds of coronaviruses in an effort to help doctors in the prevention and treatment of these damages, which will be of significance in improving prognosis and quality of life after rehabilitation.

- **Materials and methods**: We searched PubMed® for English language articles published since 2003 with the keywords "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)", "severe acute respiratory syndrome-2 (SARS-CoV-2)", "severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV", and "Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV", combined with "semen" and "kidney". We also used relevant data from websites including the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

- **Results**: Recent studies have revealed that both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 invade target cells through a membrane-bound angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, an important component of the renin-angiotensin system, which maintains human homeostasis, whereas MERS utilizes host cells' receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4 for entry. While pneumonia is the most prominent symptom in patients infected by coronaviruses due to transmission through respiratory droplets, the urogenital system can also suffer from infection with coronaviruses, resulting in renal failure, testicular atrophy, etc. The impairments of the genitourinary system would differ with the three coronavirus infections.

### Considerations for bedside urologic procedures in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 [^114tM7NX]. Urology (2020). Low credibility.

To provide guidance when performing bedside urologic procedures on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) positive patients and offer considerations to maximize the safety of the patients and providers, conserve supplies, and provide optimal management of urologic issues, we consulted with urologic trainees and attending physicians at our institution. These professionals, who are familiar with existing safety recommendations and guidelines regarding the care of infected patients, were queried regarding their experiences to determine an expert consensus on best practices for bedside procedures for SARS-CoV-2 positive patients.

- **General recommendations for urologic interventions**: Our team developed the following: maximize the use of telehealth (even for inpatient consults), minimize in-room time, use personal protective equipment appropriately, enlist a colleague to assist, acquire all supplies that may be needed, and maintain them outside the room.

Detailed recommendations were also developed for difficult urethral catheterization, bedside cystoscopy, incision and drainage of abscesses, and gross hematuria/clot irrigations.

As patients hospitalized with SARS-CoV-2 infection are predominantly men over 50 years old, there are significant urologic challenges common in this population that have emerged with this pandemic. While there is tremendous variation in how different regions have been affected, the demographics of SARS-CoV-2 mean that urologists will continue to have a unique role in helping to manage these patients.

### Prospective follow-up of overactive bladder symptoms in patients with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection [^117VWsN7]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2024). Low credibility.

SARS-CoV-2 infection can result in genitourinary symptoms such as frequency, urgency, nocturia, and pain/pressure. In this study, we followed the progression of overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms in patients who reported new or worsening OAB symptoms after coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) diagnosis.

Individuals from a COVID-19 serology study were invited to participate in a follow-up study. Respondents were divided into three groups based on prior COVID-19 testing. Participants scored symptoms retrospectively before the pandemic, at the study onset, and prospectively during a 12-month follow-up. Genitourinary symptoms were assessed using the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire for OAB (ICIQ-OAB). Changes in ICIQ-OAB scores from baseline were calculated, with a minimal important difference of one on the ICIQ-OAB considered a significant change.

- **Results**: 26.0% of participants previously had a positive COVID polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test (PCR+), 5.6% had a positive serology test only (Ser+), and 65.5% were COVID naïve (COVID-). A significant increase in ICIQ-OAB score was reported by 23.8% of participants at study onset compared to prepandemic. ICIQ-OAB scores were similar prepandemic but significantly higher at study start (p < 0.001) in the PCR+ group. During follow-up, changes in ICIQ-OAB scores from baseline remained unchanged for the COVID- group but gradually reduced for PCR+, reaching similar levels as the COVID- group by 12 months. By 12 months, 71.4% of PCR+, 42.9% of Ser+, and 68.8% of COVID- participants still reported a significant increase in ICIQ-OAB scores.

### Evaluation of the effectiveness of four alternative approaches for the classical cough test during a urodynamic study in the context of the COVID-19 global pandemic [^115oNAuW]. BMC Urology (2023). Low credibility.

Urodynamic studies (UDS) are generally used to describe measurements that assess the function and dysfunction of the lower urinary tract using an appropriate method. In 2002, the International Continence Society (ICS) published the first version of the "Good Urodynamic Practices (GUP)", with updated versions published in 2013–2015 and 2015–2016. The GUP serves as the official international guidelines for UDS and is currently the most recognized urodynamic technical guidelines in the world. In the "Pressure Signal Quality Control: Qualitative and Quantitative Plausibility" section of the GUP, the minimum criteria for urodynamic quality control are specified. This section clarifies that the "cough" test is an important way to check whether the signal is "alive". The GUP emphasizes that cough tests must be performed throughout the entire UDS process; from the beginning to the end of the test, cough tests should be performed once for every 50 mL of filled volume.

However, in December 2019, a highly contagious viral pneumonia caused by the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first reported in Wuhan, China. The disease soon spread throughout China, and COVID-19 cases were subsequently reported around the world. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak a public health emergency. Generally, infected people spread virus particles when they speak, breathe, cough, or sneeze; similar to other viral diseases, the main transmission routes include person-to-person transmission, airborne transmission, and other modes of transmission.

### Coronavirus disease 2019 and kidney injury [^113CZbDB]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2021). Low credibility.

In this paper, we seek to review coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-associated kidney injury with a focus on what is known about pathophysiology.

- **Recent findings**: Kidney injury is a common complication of SARS-CoV-2 infection and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Acute tubular necrosis and glomerular injury are two common findings. Direct viral effect, endothelial dysfunction, and podocyte and tubular epithelial injury have been described. COVID-19-related glomerular injury may also be associated with high-risk APOL1 genotype.

- **Summary**: Data on COVID-19 renal involvement have suggested novel mechanisms of kidney injury that need to be further elucidated. More data are needed on renal involvement in milder disease, renal-specific therapeutic interventions, and long-term sequelae.

### EAU guidelines on urological infections [^117CU9Hp]. EAU (2025). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of catheter-associated urinary tract infections, specifically concerning antibiotic therapy, the EAU 2025 guidelines recommend administering one of the following regimens as empirical therapy for patients with complicated pyelonephritis exhibiting systemic symptoms:

- **Amoxicillin and an aminoglycoside**: This combination targets a broad range of bacteria and is often used in severe infections.

- **Second-generation cephalosporin and an aminoglycoside**: This regimen expands coverage, targeting resistant strains more effectively.

- **IV third-generation cephalosporin**: This provides broad-spectrum coverage and is often used in severe systemic infections where oral administration is not feasible.
