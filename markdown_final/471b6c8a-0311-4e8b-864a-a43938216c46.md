## Question

if a person has chronic intermittent LLQ pain with nausea/vomiting, heavy alcoholic should i get imaging. labs generally wnl in ers crp, cbc, cmp except slightly elevated alk phos

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking if they should get imaging for chronic, intermittent left lower quadrant pain with nausea/vomiting, heavy alcohol use, and labs that are generally normal except for mildly elevated alkaline phosphatase. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical presentation and differential for LLQ pain. Then, I should verify what current imaging guidelines recommend for LLQ pain. Next, I will review how much weight to give normal inflammatory labs in this context. After that, I need to consider how heavy alcohol use and a slightly elevated alkaline phosphatase shift pretest probability and imaging choice. I will then apply risk stratification and determine the most appropriate initial modality. Finally, I should anticipate counterarguments about over-imaging and close with a specific recommendation anchored to guideline-grade evidence, ensuring that I double-check each assertion against authoritative sources like the ACR Appropriateness Criteria before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame: LLQ pain with chronic, intermittent pattern plus vomiting broadens the differential beyond diverticular disease to include colitis, epiploic appendagitis, ureteral calculi, gynecologic pathology, and occasionally referred processes; the normal CRP/CBC reduces but does not eliminate acute inflammation, and the mild alkaline phosphatase elevation in a heavy alcohol user raises a parallel consideration for hepatobiliary or pancreatic disease, though the pain is left-sided, which tempers that suspicion; epiploic appendagitis is a classic mimicker of diverticulitis with frequently normal labs, so I should keep it on the list to avoid anchoring too early [^1147mvFJ] [^112pgiSH].

> Wait, let me verify guideline direction for LLQ pain before I jump ahead: the ACR Appropriateness Criteria 2023 for left lower quadrant pain recommend CT of the abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast as the initial imaging test for suspected diverticulitis and its complications and, by extension, as the first-line modality to evaluate LLQ pain because of its broad diagnostic yield for alternative etiologies in that quadrant, which seems directly applicable here given the persistent symptoms and vomiting despite normal labs [^115deDqE].

> Hold on, I should double-check the role of laboratory results so I don't over-interpret normal values: decision-making based solely on clinical and laboratory evaluation risks missed urgent conditions, and studies show normal WBC and CRP can be seen in significant pathology, especially early or intermittently active disease; thus, the normal inflammatory markers in this case cannot safely exclude diverticulitis, colitis, epiploic appendagitis, or other surgical processes, reinforcing the need to image when concern persists [^113NoZTN] [^112pgiSH].

> Now, regarding the alcohol use and mildly elevated alkaline phosphatase, I initially thought, "Should I start with a right upper quadrant ultrasound to evaluate biliary obstruction or cholestasis", but wait, I should verify whether the symptom localization should drive the initial test; RUQ ultrasound is indeed first-line for RUQ pain or suspected biliary colic/cholecystitis, yet this patient's primary complaint is LLQ pain with vomiting, so a comprehensive CT A/P with IV contrast remains the most appropriate first study, with hepatobiliary ultrasound reserved if RUQ symptoms or cholestatic pattern strengthen later, and I should remember that pancreatitis requires typical pain or enzymes ≥ 3× ULN or imaging findings, none of which are present between flares here [^116LQFvF] [^115XDdSy].

> Next, I should review risk stratification principles to ensure I am not over-imaging: persistent or progressive abdominal pain with vomiting and any red flag, such as an abnormal liver enzyme signal or heavy alcohol use, warrants diagnostic imaging when history, exam, and labs do not yield a clear diagnosis, which fits this scenario given ongoing concern for organic pathology despite normal CRP and CBC [^117PDmzo].

> I will now examine the modality choice more granularly: CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast best surveys the colon, mesentery, urinary tract, and adjacent organs for diverticulitis, colitis, epiploic appendagitis, obstruction, abscess, or mass; ultrasound would have limited sensitivity for LLQ etiologies; MRI is a reasonable alternative if CT is contraindicated, and if stone disease becomes the leading concern, a noncontrast CT could be used, although that is not the dominant hypothesis given the symptom complex and location [^115deDqE] [^113KcCn9] [^1146XbnY].

> But wait, what about "Choosing Wisely" cautions against over-imaging functional pain; I need to ensure we are not misapplying those recommendations: avoiding repeated CT in functional abdominal pain applies after organic disease is reasonably excluded, which is not yet the case here given red flags and no established functional diagnosis; additionally, in patients with prior diverticulitis and chronic symptoms, expert guidance supports re-evaluating with imaging to exclude ongoing inflammation before labeling symptoms as visceral hypersensitivity, which aligns with proceeding to CT in this presentation [^116VMBCk] [^111oYCq8].

> Let me consolidate and make sure nothing is missing: LLQ pain with vomiting, heavy alcohol use, and a slight alk phos elevation warrants imaging because clinical and lab assessment alone may miss urgent pathology; the highest-yield, guideline-endorsed initial study is CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast; if CT is negative and symptoms persist, I should pivot to targeted evaluations, including hepatobiliary ultrasound if cholestatic symptoms emerge and consideration of lower endoscopy or functional etiologies as appropriate, but the first step remains a contrast-enhanced CT to define or exclude diverticular disease, epiploic appendagitis, colitis, obstruction, abscess, or mass [^115deDqE] [^113NoZTN] [^117PDmzo].

> Final recommendation: Yes, imaging is indicated, and the appropriate initial modality is CT of the abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast, given ACR recommendations for LLQ pain, the limited negative predictive value of normal inflammatory labs in intermittent disease, and the patient's risk profile; this approach will detect or exclude urgent pathologies and guide further management, after which, if negative, a stepwise evaluation for biliary, pancreatic, or functional causes can proceed based on evolving clinical features [^115deDqE] [^113NoZTN] [^117PDmzo].

Imaging is **indicated** for chronic intermittent LLQ pain with nausea/vomiting in a heavy alcohol user, even with normal labs except mildly elevated alk phos. CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast is the **first-line test** to evaluate for diverticulitis, colitis, malignancy, or pancreatitis [^115deDqE], as labs can be normal in early or chronic disease [^113NoZTN] [^112pgiSH]. Imaging is especially important in heavy alcohol use because it increases risk for pancreatitis, hepatic/biliary disease, and malignancy, and early CT improves diagnostic certainty and guides management [^116WvLTW] [^113NoZTN].

---

## Clinical significance of chronic intermittent LLQ pain with nausea/vomiting

Chronic intermittent LLQ pain with nausea/vomiting warrants a **broad differential**, including:

- **Diverticulitis**: Common in the LLQ; can be chronic/intermittent [^1147mvFJ].
- **Colitis**: Infectious, inflammatory, or ischemic [^111nuCMr].
- **Malignancy**: Colorectal cancer or other neoplasms [^1159b7iC].
- **Pancreatitis**: Chronic or recurrent, especially with alcohol use.
- **Functional disorders**: IBS or other functional GI disorders [^116VMBCk].

---

## Impact of heavy alcohol use on abdominal pathology

Heavy alcohol use **increases the risk** of acute and chronic pancreatitis, which may present with intermittent pain and normal early labs; hepatic and biliary disease (alcoholic hepatitis, cirrhosis, cholangitis, biliary obstruction); and gastrointestinal malignancy, including colorectal and pancreatic cancer. Given these risks, imaging is **warranted** to exclude serious pathology [^111nuCMr].

---

## Clinical significance of mildly elevated alkaline phosphatase

A mildly elevated alkaline phosphatase may **indicate** hepatobiliary or pancreatic disease, including biliary obstruction from stones, strictures, or malignancy; cholestatic liver disease such as primary sclerosing cholangitis or alcoholic liver disease; and pancreatic disease such as chronic pancreatitis or pancreatic malignancy. Even mild elevations can indicate **significant disease**, especially with alcohol use.

---

## Role of imaging in chronic intermittent LLQ pain

Imaging is **essential** to identify or rule out serious pathology when labs are normal [^113NoZTN]:

- **CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast**: First-line for LLQ pain [^115deDqE]; evaluates diverticulitis, colitis, malignancy, and pancreatitis [^111nuCMr].
- **MRI abdomen**: Alternative when CT is contraindicated or inconclusive [^112TdBTm].
- **Ultrasound**: Limited for LLQ pain but useful for hepatobiliary disease [^115XDdSy].

---

## Evidence supporting imaging in this clinical scenario

Evidence supports **imaging** for chronic intermittent LLQ pain with normal labs:

- **ACR guidelines**: Recommend CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast for LLQ pain, including suspected diverticulitis or complications [^115deDqE] [^1147mvFJ].
- **Early CT**: Improves diagnostic certainty and guides management in abdominal pain [^116WvLTW] [^113NoZTN].
- **Alcohol-related disease**: Imaging is critical to detect pancreatitis, hepatic/biliary disease, and malignancy [^113p99NM] [^1124zXSb] [^1159b7iC].

---

## Potential risks and benefits of imaging

### Benefits

Imaging provides an **accurate diagnosis** by identifying serious pathology that labs may miss and informs management [^113NoZTN]. Early detection can **improve outcomes** by preventing complications.

---

### Risks

Imaging **carries risks**, including radiation exposure with CT, contrast-related allergic or nephrotoxic reactions, and financial cost [^113NoZTN]. Despite these risks, **benefits outweigh harms** in this scenario [^117PDmzo].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Clinical guidelines **support imaging** in this context [^111nuCMr]. The **ACR appropriateness criteria** recommend CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast for LLQ pain [^115deDqE], and the **AGA guidelines** advise imaging for chronic symptoms after diverticulitis to exclude ongoing inflammation or complications [^111oYCq8].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

Imaging is **indicated** for chronic intermittent LLQ pain with nausea/vomiting in a heavy alcohol user, even when labs are normal aside from a mildly elevated alkaline phosphatase. CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast is the **first-line test** [^115deDqE] to evaluate for diverticulitis, colitis, malignancy, or pancreatitis, as labs can be normal in early or chronic disease [^113p99NM]. Imaging is especially important in heavy alcohol use, which increases the risk of pancreatitis, hepatobiliary disease, and malignancy; early CT improves diagnostic certainty [^113NoZTN] and guides management [^116WvLTW].

### A randomized, controlled trial of routine early abdominal computed tomography in patients presenting with non-specific acute abdominal pain [^116WvLTW]. Clinical Radiology (2007). Low credibility.

The aim was to compare the effect of an initial early computed tomography (CT) examination versus standard practice (SP) on the length of hospital stay, diagnostic accuracy, and mortality of adults presenting with acute abdominal pain.

- **Materials and methods**: Two hundred and five adults presenting with acute abdominal pain were randomized to undergo an early CT examination or SP, which comprised supine abdominal and erect chest radiography. One hundred and ninety-eight patients (99 in each arm) were included in the analysis. The primary endpoint was the duration of inpatient stay; secondary endpoints were diagnostic certainty and mortality.

- **Results**: There was no significant difference in the length of hospital stay between the two arms (p = 0.20). At randomization, 36% (35 of 96) of CT patients and 49% (48 of 98) of SP patients were correctly diagnosed; 24 hours after randomization, the correct diagnosis had been established in 84% of CT patients and 73% of SP patients. This refinement in diagnostic certainty was significantly better in the CT group (p < 0.001). There was no difference in mortality between the two trial arms (p = 0.31).

- **Conclusion**: Early abdominal CT in patients with acute abdominal pain improves diagnostic certainty but does not reduce the length of hospital stay and six-month mortality.

### Imaging strategies for detection of urgent conditions in patients with acute abdominal pain: Diagnostic accuracy study [^113NoZTN]. BMJ (2009). Low credibility.

Acute abdominal pain accounts for 5–10% of visits to the emergency department. Rapid and accurate detection of urgent conditions is vital for managing patients and ensuring efficient throughput of patients. Decision-making based solely on clinical and laboratory evaluation can result in unnecessary interventions or delayed treatment of urgent conditions. Several forms of imaging, particularly ultrasonography and computed tomography (CT), assist in clinical decision-making. Imaging has been shown to positively affect the accuracy of clinical diagnosis, lead to changes in management decisions, and increase the level of diagnostic certainty in patients with acute abdominal pain. The use of early CT in patients with abdominal pain has been shown to reduce the number of serious diagnoses missed.

Over the years, diagnostic imaging in the emergency department has increased hospital costs, and CT has become a growing source of radiation exposure in adult patients. This calls for a rational, evidence-based approach to imaging in patients with abdominal pain. The American College of Radiology has provided guidelines for imaging in such patients, with specific locations of abdominal tenderness. This differentiation in imaging using patient-tailored guidelines may not sufficiently cover the wide spectrum of clinical presentations of abdominal pain.

An optimal imaging strategy in patients with abdominal pain would lead to timely identification of urgent conditions.

### Thoracic imaging tests for the diagnosis of COVID-19 [^114bgKcP]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Low credibility.

With respect to the three versions of this review, the sensitivity estimates of chest CT appear to remain similar across all versions, while the specificity estimates of chest CT appear to increase with each update. With the number of chest CT studies included in this review, sensitivity and specificity estimates appear to be stable and have narrow confidence intervals. This may suggest that pooled sensitivity and specificity estimates of chest CT will not notably differ in future updates of this review.

- **Strengths and weaknesses of the review**: Our search strategy was broad and allowed for the identification of a wide range of articles about COVID‐19 diagnosis. The review authors screened records, extracted data, and assessed study methodology independently and in duplicate. Although we are relatively confident in the accuracy and completeness of our findings, please inform us should errors be found so that we can address them in a future update. Furthermore, compared to our initial review (Salameh 2020a), as well as the first update of our review (Islam 2020), this update includes a greater number of studies that evaluated accuracy estimates of imaging tests in the diagnosis of suspected COVID‐19 participants.

We included studies that involved only symptomatic participants, as well as studies that had a mixed population (i.e. symptomatic and asymptomatic participants). Thus, there may be situations when asymptomatic individuals are suspected of having COVID‐19, such as if they have infected contacts or other risk factors.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for adrenal incidentaloma, specifically with respect to diagnostic imaging, the ENSAT/ESE 2023 guidelines recommend providing an individualized approach for adrenal masses not falling into the specified categories (tumor size ≥ 4 cm with unenhanced HUs of 11–20; tumor size > 20; or tumor size < 4 cm with a heterogeneous appearance). It is advised to discuss such cases in a multidisciplinary team meeting, acknowledging that the likelihood of malignancy remains low. In most cases, obtaining immediate additional imaging according to the center's expertise and availability is preferable. Interval imaging, through non-contrast CT or MRI, should be obtained in 6–12 months if the tumor is still considered an indeterminate mass and surgery is not performed.

### Diagnostic options for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) [^11573woZ]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2020). Low credibility.

Because lung abnormalities may appear ahead of clinical manifestations and positive NAAT, some studies have recommended that early chest computerized tomography (CT) be used to screen suspected cases of COVID-19. Furthermore, pneumonia manifests with chest CT imaging and suggests the evolution and prognosis of COVID-19. Nevertheless, due to the highly contagious nature of SARS-CoV-2 and the risk of transporting critically ill patients, the choice to conduct a chest CT scan in patients with suspected or established COVID-19 is made infrequently. In addition, lung ultrasonography may have great utility in managing COVID-19 pneumonia due to its safety, repeatability, absence of radiation, low cost, and point-of-care use. For cases in which pulmonary ultrasound is not sufficient to answer clinical questions, a chest CT is needed.

In summary, combining assessment of imaging features with clinical and laboratory findings could facilitate early diagnosis of COVID-19. Here, we have systematically summarized the various diagnostic methods for SARS-CoV-2. More importantly, this work offers practical options for diagnosing COVID-19. Our experience may help clinicians make better decisions in the effort to become victorious over SARS-CoV-2.

### The diagnosis of SARS-CoV2 pneumonia: A review of laboratory and radiological testing results [^113b4L4r]. Journal of Medical Virology (2020). Low credibility.

The rapid emergence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has necessitated the implementation of diverse pandemic control strategies throughout the world. To effectively control the spread of this disease, it is essential that it be diagnosed at an early stage so that patients can be reliably quarantined, thereby slowing disease spread. At present, the diagnosis of this infectious form of coronavirus pneumonia largely depends on a combination of laboratory testing and imaging analyses, which exhibit variable diagnostic efficacy.

In this report, we reviewed prior literature pertaining to the diagnosis of different forms of pneumonia caused by coronaviruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome, and SARS-CoV-2. We assessed two different potential diagnostic approaches. We found that computed tomography was associated with a higher rate of diagnostic accuracy than real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (P = 0.0041) and chest radiography (P = 0.0100). Even so, it is important for clinicians to utilize a combination of laboratory and radiological testing where possible to ensure this virus is reliably and quickly detected. This approach allows for timely treatment and isolation of patients, effectively curbing the further progression of this pandemic.

### Multimodality imaging in evaluation of cardiovascular complications in patients with COVID-19: JACC scientific expert panel [^112wP2g9]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2020). Low credibility.

The standard evaluation and management of patients with suspected or confirmed cardiovascular complications of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), present challenges. Routine history, physical examination, laboratory testing, electrocardiography, and plain X-ray imaging may be sufficient for such patients. However, given the overlap between COVID-19 and typical cardiovascular diagnoses such as heart failure and acute myocardial infarction, there often arises a need for advanced imaging techniques to assist in differential diagnosis and management.

This document provides guidance in several common scenarios among patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection and possible cardiovascular involvement, including chest discomfort with electrocardiographic changes, acute hemodynamic instability, newly recognized left ventricular dysfunction, and imaging during the subacute/chronic phase of COVID-19. For each scenario, the role of biomarker testing is considered to guide imaging decision-making. The document provides differential diagnostic considerations and offers general suggestions regarding the application of various advanced imaging techniques.

### Thoracic imaging tests for the diagnosis of COVID-19 [^11785TBV]. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of infection by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) presents major challenges. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing is used to diagnose an infection, but its utility as a reference standard is constrained by sampling errors, limited sensitivity (71% to 98%), and dependence on the timing of specimen collection. Chest imaging tests are being used in the diagnosis of COVID-19 disease or when RT-PCR testing is unavailable.

- **Objectives**: To determine the diagnostic accuracy of chest imaging (computed tomography (CT), X-ray, and ultrasound) in people with suspected or confirmed COVID-19.

- **Search methods**: We searched the COVID-19 Living Evidence Database from the University of Bern, the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, and The Stephen B. Thacker CDC Library. In addition, we checked repositories of COVID-19 publications. We did not apply any language restrictions and conducted searches for this review iteration up to 5 May 2020.

- **Selection criteria**: We included studies of all designs that produce estimates of test accuracy or provide data from which estimates can be computed. We included two types of cross-sectional designs: a) where all patients suspected of the target condition enter the study through the same route, and b) where it is not clear upfront who has and who does not have the target condition, or where the patients with the target condition are recruited in a different way or from a different population from the patients without the target condition.

### Do C-reactive protein level, white blood cell count, and pain location guide the selection of patients for computed tomography imaging in non-traumatic acute abdomen [^115V1uWw]. Emergency Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

The value of abdominal computed tomography in non-traumatic abdominal pain has been well established. However, managing computed tomography appropriateness has become more of an issue due to the increase in patient radiation exposure associated with its use. This study aimed to investigate whether C-reactive protein, white blood cell count, and pain location might guide the selection of patients for computed tomography in non-traumatic acute abdomen.

Patients presenting with acute abdomen to the emergency department over a 12-month period and who subsequently underwent computed tomography were retrospectively reviewed. Those with serum C-reactive protein and white blood cell count measured on admission or within 24 hours of the computed tomography were selected. Computed tomography examinations were retrospectively reviewed, and final diagnoses were designated as either positive or negative for pathology relating to the presentation with acute abdomen.

- **Diagnostics analysis**: White blood cell counts, C-reactive protein levels, and pain locations were analyzed to determine whether they increased or decreased the likelihood of producing a diagnostic computed tomography. The likelihood ratio for computed tomography positivity with a C-reactive protein level above 5 mg/L was 1.71. This increased to 7.71 in patients with a combination of elevated C-reactive protein level, white blood cell count, and right lower quadrant pain. Combined elevated C-reactive protein level and white blood cell count in patients with right lower quadrant pain may represent a potential indicator.

### Thoracic imaging tests for the diagnosis of COVID-19 [^114yYg2p]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022).

Thoracic imaging plays an integral role in 'ruling out' COVID‐19 pneumonia when RT‐PCR is unavailable, pending, or negative, or when clinical suspicion is 'low' based on other signs, symptoms, and routine laboratory tests. The role of testing includes triage for RT‐PCR and decision-making about performing additional tests such as RT‐PCR. Thoracic imaging is utilized to rule in or rule out COVID‐19 when results from other tests (e.g. RT‐PCR) are not available in a timely manner.

- **Concurrent/combination testing**: Thoracic imaging is often used alongside other diagnostic tests to improve diagnostic accuracy. For example, it can identify false negatives of other tests (e.g. RT‐PCR) and enhance the overall accuracy of the testing strategy. Additionally, thoracic imaging is used to detect COVID‐19 in asymptomatic patients.

Several diagnostic pathways have been proposed to guide physicians in identifying people with COVID‐19. These pathways differ in order and components, taking into account pre-test probability, physical examination, laboratory tests, and findings based on RT‐PCR results and availability. Some professional organizations, such as Rubin (2020), recommend imaging for patients with moderate or severe features of COVID‐19. In certain hospitals, low‐dose chest CT results are among the parameters considered (along with molecular test results, routine laboratory results, and clinical signs and symptoms) to categorize patients as low risk, moderate to high risk, and confirmed COVID‐19 cases (China National Health Commission 2020).

### Emergency laparoscopy — current best practice [^116ni8gB]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Whilst most patients presenting with abdominal pain will be diagnosed within a short period of assessment, there remains a cohort in whom the clinical picture remains equivocal. In these patients, depending on the severity of their symptoms, laparoscopy plays a role. If the patient's symptoms and laboratory findings are relatively less concerning, then a period of observation may allow clarification of a diagnosis or simply cessation of the pain. However, in those where observation is not safe due to the severity of the clinical findings, we advocate diagnostic laparoscopy. The reasons for this are twofold. Firstly, converted-to-open cases have a similar outcome to primary laparotomy, thus minimizing potential negative effects of laparoscopy. Secondly, as discussed above, many common pathologies, which may be the underlying cause of the non-specific abdominal pain, are now best managed laparoscopically.

### Delays in imaging diagnosis of acute abdominal pain in the emergency setting [^1135ZSij]. Clinical Imaging (2022). Low credibility.

Acute abdominal pain is a common cause of emergency department (ED) visits and often necessitates imaging to achieve a specific diagnosis. Prompt and appropriate imaging plays a crucial role in patient management, leading to improved patient outcomes, decreased hospital stay, and enhanced ED workflow. Many cases involve delays in diagnosis and management due to a combination of institutional policies and deficiencies in knowledge of imaging guidelines.

- **Institutional policies and knowledge deficits**: The inappropriate use of abdominal radiographs, the use of oral contrast for CT abdomen and pelvis, and concern over iodinated contrast-induced acute kidney injury are notable roadblocks to prompt imaging diagnosis.

The purpose of this review is to explore why these potential causes of delayed diagnosis occur and how radiologists can improve imaging and ED workflow. Utilizing the most up-to-date imaging guidelines from authoritative sources such as the American College of Radiology (ACR) Appropriateness Criteria and ACR Manual on Contrast Media can assist clinicians working in the emergency setting.

### Clinical practice guideline: Management of acute pancreatitis [^113p99NM]. Canadian Journal of Surgery (2016). High credibility.

The diagnostic criteria for acute pancreatitis serve as a clinical tool for the identification and confirmation of this condition in patients presenting with relevant symptoms. Their primary purpose is to facilitate accurate diagnosis, thereby enabling timely and appropriate treatment.

The diagnostic criteria are based on three primary components:

- **Abdominal pain**: The abdominal pain associated with acute pancreatitis is typically acute in onset, persistent, severe, and located in the epigastric region, often radiating to the back.

- **Elevated levels of lipase or amylase**: This involves a significant increase in the levels of pancreatic enzymes, specifically lipase or amylase, to more than three times the upper limit of normal.

- **Characteristic findings on imaging studies such as CT or MRI**: This involves the identification of findings indicative of acute pancreatitis on CT or MRI scans.

The diagnosis of acute pancreatitis is confirmed if two of the three criteria are met. These combinations can be either the presence of abdominal pain and elevated enzyme levels, elevated enzyme levels and characteristic imaging findings, or abdominal pain and characteristic imaging findings. If these combinations are not met, the diagnostic criteria for acute pancreatitis are not fulfilled. This approach ensures a high degree of diagnostic accuracy while allowing for appropriate medical intervention.

### Imaging strategies for detection of urgent conditions in patients with acute abdominal pain: Diagnostic accuracy study [^112R7GcV]. BMJ (2009). Low credibility.

We calculated sensitivity and specificity for detecting urgent conditions for each of the 11 diagnostic strategies by comparing the results of the strategy with the final diagnosis assigned by the expert panel. We also calculated the percentage of missed cases (1−sensitivity) and the percentage of false positives (false positives/all positives). The stability of ultrasonography performance was investigated by comparing accuracy results between radiologists, supervised and non-supervised residents, and the participating centers. We plotted the accuracy of all strategies in a receiver operating characteristic space. For the calculation of diagnostic accuracy, inconclusive test results were treated as negative. We considered imaging results inconclusive if no radiological diagnosis was made and abnormalities were not excluded on imaging.

We used the McNemar test statistic for comparing sensitivities and specificities between single imaging strategies. The clinical diagnosis and the most accurate single test strategy were compared with the multi-investigation strategies. We evaluated the accuracy gain from combining two forms of imaging relative to the most accurate single test strategy by directly comparing the corresponding positive and negative likelihood ratios of the strategies, as described by Macaskill and colleagues. We calculated the percentage of patients who had ultrasonography and the percentage who were exposed to CT-related ionizing radiation for each strategy.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® left lower quadrant pain: 2023 update [^1147mvFJ]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2023). High credibility.

The differential diagnosis for left lower quadrant pain is broad, encompassing conditions ranging from benign and self-limited to life-threatening surgical emergencies. Along with patient history, physical examination, and laboratory tests, imaging is often critical to narrowing the differential diagnosis and identifying life-threatening abnormalities. This document discusses the guidelines for the appropriate use of imaging in the initial workup for patients presenting with left lower quadrant pain, suspected diverticulitis, and suspected complications from diverticulitis.

The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions, reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process supports the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer-reviewed journals. Established methodological principles, such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE), are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In instances where peer-reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

### Thoracic imaging tests for the diagnosis of COVID-19 [^116bYEue]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). High credibility.

Abstract

Our March 2021 edition of this review demonstrated that thoracic imaging, particularly computed tomography (CT), is sensitive and moderately specific in diagnosing COVID‐19 pneumonia. This new edition provides an updated review.

Our objectives were to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of thoracic imaging in individuals suspected of having COVID-19; to assess the rate of positive imaging among those with an initial negative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR) result who later tested positive via RT‐PCR on follow-up; and to evaluate the accuracy of thoracic imaging for screening COVID‐19 in asymptomatic individuals. A secondary objective was to assess threshold effects of index test positivity on accuracy.

We searched the COVID‐19 Living Evidence Database from the University of Bern, the Cochrane COVID‐19 Study Register, The Stephen B. Thacker CDC Library, and repositories of COVID‐19 publications until 17 February 2021. No language restrictions were applied.

We included diagnostic accuracy studies of all designs, excluding case‐control studies, that recruited participants of any age suspected to have COVID‐19. The studies needed to assess chest CT, chest X-ray, or ultrasound of the lungs for the diagnosis of COVID-19, utilize a reference standard that included RT‐PCR, and report estimates of test accuracy or provide data from which estimates could be computed. We excluded studies using imaging as part of the reference standard and those excluding participants with normal index test results.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for thyroid nodules, specifically with respect to diagnostic imaging, ultrasound, AACE/ACE/AME 2016 guidelines recommend using the following approach to describe ultrasound findings:

- **Stratification for risk of malignancy**: Focus on the potential risk involved.
- **Description of nodules**: Detail the position, size, shape, margins, content, echogenic pattern, and vascular features of the nodules.
- **Multiple nodules**: Provide details of nodules bearing characteristics associated with malignancy rather than describing the largest or dominant nodule.
- **Suspicious regional neck lymph nodes**: Describe the cervical compartment, number, shape, size, margins, content, echogenic pattern, presence of hilum, and vascular features.
- **Risk rating**: Add a rating stratifying thyroid lesions based on their risk of malignancy to reliably communicate the expected risk of cancer.

### What clinical and laboratory parameters determine significant intra-abdominal pathology for patients assessed in hospital with acute abdominal pain [^1136EALE]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

There were 286 patients over a three-month period of the study, of whom 201 (70%) were females. The median age was 37 years. The causes of abdominal pain are shown in the surgical and non-surgical tables, as the table numbers were not listed. Non-specific abdominal pain was the diagnosis in 98 patients (34% of the total), and 72 (73%) of them were females. The non-specific nature of the pain was determined by clinical resolution of the symptoms or diagnostic laparoscopy. None of those patients with non-specific pain had guarding or vomiting, and only five of them had a raised white cell count. A non-surgical cause was seen in 47 patients.

- **Univariate analysis**: Important factors that predict acute surgical pathology include guarding (p < 0.0001), raised WBC (p < 0.0001), tachycardia (pulse rate greater than 100 per minute, p < 0.0001), temperature (p < 0.0001), rigors (p = 0.0008), lack of appetite (p < 0.0001), and vomiting (p < 0.0001).

- **Multivariate analysis**: Using logistic regression, the only significant predicting factors for acute surgical diagnosis are heart rate (p = 0.048), guarding (p = 0.0009), WBC (p = 0.016), and vomiting (p = 0.008).

Regarding diagnostic investigations for invasive candidiasis, more specifically with respect to diagnostic imaging, ASM/ECMM/ISHAM 2025 guidelines recommend obtaining the following imaging modalities in patients with suspected deep-seated invasive candidiasis:

- **Abdominal ultrasound**: Useful for detecting liver and spleen involvement.
- **Abdominal CT**: Provides detailed images of internal organs, aiding in the detection of abscesses.
- **Brain MRI**: Essential for identifying potential central nervous system involvement.

These guidelines highlight the importance of comprehensive diagnostic imaging to ensure accurate detection and management of invasive candidiasis.

### Evidence-based, cost-effective management of acute appendicitis: An algorithm of the Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery emergency general surgery algorithms work group [^111mMYUn]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2025). Low credibility.

Evaluation of the patient with acute abdominal pain begins with a thorough history and physical examination. Patients typically present with 12 to 24 hours of mid-abdominal pain, which may migrate to the right lower quadrant. In the early course of appendicitis, the physical examination may reveal non-localizing, mid-abdominal pain without peritoneal irritation. Additional symptoms may include loss of appetite, abdominal distention, nausea, vomiting, malaise, obstipation, fever, and chills. Patients may also have certain physical signs associated with appendicitis:

- **Psoas sign**: An irritation of the iliopsoas muscle in the abdomen, a classic finding of acute appendicitis. It can be elicited by performing passive extension of the right hip with the patient lying on their left side.
- **Rovsing's sign**: Observed when deep palpation of the left lower quadrant elicits pain in the right lower quadrant.

Patients presenting later in the course of the disease process may develop peritoneal inflammation with localized guarding and rebound tenderness adjacent to the appendix in the right lower quadrant.

Standard laboratory tests should include a complete blood count, urine analysis, and routine chemistry if the patient requires further imaging or operative management. It is important to note that the white blood cell count may not be elevated in early acute appendicitis.

### Thoracic imaging tests for the diagnosis of COVID-19 [^1123me72]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). High credibility.

Our findings are applicable to individuals suspected to have COVID-19 as the studies in our cohort included such participants. However, our search did not identify many studies evaluating the accuracy of chest CT, ultrasound of the lungs, and chest X-ray for the diagnosis of COVID-19 in pediatric populations. Thus, the diagnostic accuracy of these modalities in children is not as well-established. Additionally, the lack of data available in the included studies pertaining to signs and symptoms of presenting cases, the severity of symptoms, and the timing of symptom onset adds complexity to the interpretation of the findings in this review. It should be noted that the results primarily apply to imaging interpreted by radiologists.

### Diagnostic imaging of acute abdominal pain in adults [^117PDmzo]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Acute abdominal pain is a common presentation in the outpatient setting and can represent conditions ranging from benign to life-threatening causes. If the patient history, physical examination, and laboratory testing do not identify an underlying cause of pain and if serious pathology remains a clinical concern, diagnostic imaging is indicated. The American College of Radiology has developed clinical guidelines, the Appropriateness Criteria, based on the location of abdominal pain to help physicians choose the most appropriate imaging study.

- **Right upper quadrant pain**: Ultrasonography is the initial imaging test of choice for patients presenting with right upper quadrant pain.

- **Right or left lower quadrant pain**: Computed tomography (CT) is recommended for evaluating right or left lower quadrant pain.

- **Conventional radiography**: This method has limited diagnostic value in the assessment of most patients with abdominal pain.

The widespread use of CT raises concerns about patient exposure to ionizing radiation. Strategies to reduce exposure are currently being studied, such as using ultrasonography as an initial study for suspected appendicitis before obtaining CT and using low-dose CT rather than standard-dose CT. Magnetic resonance imaging is another emerging technique for the evaluation of abdominal pain that avoids ionizing radiation.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® right lower quadrant pain: 2022 update [^1146XbnY]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2022). High credibility.

This document focuses on imaging in the adult and pregnant populations with right lower quadrant (RLQ) abdominal pain, including patients with fever and leukocytosis. Appendicitis remains the most common surgical pathology responsible for RLQ abdominal pain in the United States. Other causes of RLQ pain include right colonic diverticulitis, ureteral stone, and infectious enterocolitis. Appropriate imaging in the diagnosis of appendicitis has resulted in a decreased negative appendectomy rate from as high as 25% to approximately 1% to 3%. Contrast-enhanced CT remains the primary and most appropriate imaging modality to evaluate this patient population. MRI is approaching CT in sensitivity and specificity as this technology becomes more widely available and utilization increases. Unenhanced MRI and ultrasound remain the diagnostic procedures of choice in the pregnant patient. MRI and ultrasound continue to perform best in the hands of the experts.

The ACR appropriateness criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process supports the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer-reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios.

### Challenges in systematic reviews of diagnostic technologies [^114xFaD2]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Diagnostic tests are critical components of effective health care as they help determine the most beneficial treatments for a given patient. The assessment of these tests involves several challenges, such as a shortage of studies evaluating clinical outcomes and insufficient data on the use of tests in realistic clinical settings. The methodological quality of diagnostic test studies lags behind that of therapeutic interventions. Additionally, statistical methods for combining diagnostic accuracy data are complex and not well developed, which complicates the interpretation of results.

The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Technology Assessment Program has implemented a six-level framework for evaluating diagnostic technologies. This model emphasizes the necessity for systematic reviews of diagnostic test studies to go beyond assessing technical feasibility and accuracy, focusing instead on the impact of tests on health outcomes. In this paper, examples from three Evidence-based Practice Center reports are used to illustrate challenges reviewers may face when evaluating diagnostic test literature. These challenges include finding relevant studies, assessing the methodological quality of diagnostic accuracy studies, and synthesizing studies that evaluate tests in different patient populations or with different outcomes.

### Which appendicitis scoring system is most suitable for pregnant patients? A comparison of nine different systems [^1159h8fw]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Low credibility.

Appendicitis is generally diagnosed based on clinical and laboratory findings, including imaging analysis results. However, the presence of numerous gynecological pathologies in female patients makes diagnosing acute appendicitis challenging, particularly in pregnant patients. For example, symptoms such as nausea and vomiting are common during both pregnancy and appendicitis, and laboratory findings also tend to be similar.

Radiological examination has high diagnostic value for acute appendicitis. However, the main disadvantages of computed tomography are its teratogenic effect and high cost. The presence of positive abdominal ultrasonography (USG) findings in pregnant women with suspected appendicitis is sufficient to confirm the condition. In cases where appendicitis cannot be diagnosed using USG, magnetic resonance imaging provides high diagnostic accuracy in pregnant patients. When using new scoring systems that combine clinical and imaging features, 95% of patients with uncomplicated appendicitis can be diagnosed correctly.

Delays in diagnosis and treatment of appendicitis may result in more complicated illness and increased rates of preterm labor, perinatal morbidity, mortality, and fetal loss. The use of scoring systems helps to support imaging methods. Clinical scoring systems (CSS) may be used in acute appendicitis to facilitate early diagnosis of the disease and prevent morbidity, and the Alvarado scoring system is one of the most commonly used systems for this situation. Although the Alvarado system may be used in pregnant patients, its use has been extensively evaluated.

### Commonly used imaging techniques for diagnosis and staging [^1159b7iC]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2006). Low credibility.

Imaging plays a vital role in the management of patients with cancer. It is important for diagnosis, indicating sites of abnormality, and guiding biopsies, and it is crucial in assessing disease extent to determine treatment. This review discusses conventional imaging techniques such as ultrasound, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and 18Ffluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography. It addresses their mechanisms of action and strengths and weaknesses in the diagnosis and staging of tumors. New developments are also examined, along with radiation safety issues.

In addition, the expected future uses of imaging techniques in oncology are described. Given that each technique has inherent strengths and weaknesses, combining methods will lead to improved diagnosis, staging, and treatment prediction and monitoring.

### Thoracic imaging tests for the diagnosis of COVID-19 [^114nPjNA]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). High credibility.

This is the second update of a Cochrane living systematic review evaluating the diagnostic accuracy of thoracic imaging (CT, chest X‐ray, and ultrasound) in the evaluation of people suspected to have COVID‐19. This version of the review is based on published studies and preprints up to 30 September 2020.

- **Summary of main results**: Chest CT (41 studies, 16,133 participants; 8,110 [50%] cases) demonstrated a sensitivity of 87.9% (95% CI 84.6 to 90.6) and a specificity of 80.0% (95% CI 74.9 to 84.3) for the diagnosis of COVID‐19 in suspected participants. Compared with the findings of the first update of this 'living' systematic review, where chest CT had a sensitivity of 89.9% (95% CI 85.7 to 92.9) and specificity of 61.1% (95% CI 42.3 to 77.1), our update demonstrates similar sensitivity but notably higher specificity. Possible explanations for this improved specificity could include stricter study inclusion criteria applied for this update, particularly the exclusion of studies that report an overview of index test findings in participants with and without the target condition, without explicitly classifying the imaging test as either COVID‐19 positive or negative. The improved specificity could also be due to the addition of more studies that used well-developed definitions for index test positivity employed by index test readers (e.g. CO‐RADS, BSTI COVID‐19 Reporting Template, RSNA Expert Consensus on Reporting Chest CT Findings for COVID‐19).

### Thoracic imaging tests for the diagnosis of COVID-19 [^114tcfuM]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Low credibility.

The respiratory illness caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection continues to present diagnostic challenges. Our 2020 edition of this review showed thoracic (chest) imaging to be sensitive and moderately specific in the diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In this update, we include new relevant studies and have removed studies with case-control designs and those not intended to be diagnostic test accuracy studies.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of thoracic imaging (computed tomography (CT), X-ray, and ultrasound) in people with suspected COVID-19.

- **Search methods**: We searched the COVID-19 Living Evidence Database from the University of Bern, the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, The Stephen B. Thacker CDC Library, and repositories of COVID-19 publications through to 30 September 2020. We did not apply any language restrictions.

- **Selection criteria**: We included studies of all designs, except for case-control, that recruited participants of any age group suspected to have COVID-19 and that reported estimates of test accuracy or provided data from which we could compute estimates.

- **Data collection and analysis**: The review authors independently and in duplicate screened articles, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias and applicability concerns using the QUADAS-2 domain-list. We presented the results of estimated sensitivity and specificity using paired forest plots, and we summarized pooled estimates in tables. We used a bivariate meta-analysis model where appropriate. We presented the uncertainty of accuracy estimates using 95% confidence intervals.

### Performance of imaging studies in patients with suspected appendicitis after stratification with adult appendicitis score [^11362SRh]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

We have implemented the AAS scoring system to guide the diagnostic work-up of patients with suspected acute appendicitis. The aim of scoring is not to replace imaging; on the contrary, scoring helps to avoid underuse and overuse of imaging studies by targeting these investigations to patients with the most equivocal diagnosis. All patients with suspected appendicitis were included in the study. However, some patients should be excluded from the routine diagnostic work-up. Pregnant patients should invariably undergo imaging in case of suspected appendicitis because of the increased negative appendectomy rate and high risk of fetal loss after surgery. In pregnant patients, CT should be replaced with MRI to avoid ionizing radiation. Patients with clinical suspicion of an appendiceal abscess should undergo CT examination. In these patients, CT, in addition to being the most accurate imaging method, also assists in planning the treatment. In immunosuppressed patients, the threshold for imaging should be low, as immunosuppression alters laboratory results and can mask the typical clinical signs and symptoms of appendicitis.

In this study, US was performed and CT reported by radiology residents and attending radiologists with varying experience. Hence, this study describes well the real-life situation in the emergency setting. The preliminary reports by on-call residents in our hospital are re-evaluated the next morning by a staff radiologist; however, the re-evaluation is rarely performed before the decision of treatment is made.

In the Netherlands, the national guidelines recommend mandatory imaging in suspected cases.

### Imaging algorithm for COVID-19: A practical approach [^115sDsi8]. Clinical Imaging (2021). Low credibility.

The global pandemic of COVID-19 pneumonia, caused by the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), has strained healthcare resources worldwide, leading to emerging challenges in mass testing, resource allocation, and management. While the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test is the most commonly utilized and considered the gold standard for diagnosis, the role of chest imaging has been highlighted by several studies demonstrating the high sensitivity of computed tomography (CT). Many have suggested using CT chest as a first-line screening tool for the diagnosis of COVID-19. However, with the advancement of laboratory testing and the challenges of obtaining a CT scan without significant risk to healthcare providers, the role of imaging in diagnosis has been questioned. Several imaging societies have released consensus statements and guidelines on utilizing imaging resources and optimal reporting. In this review, we highlight the evidence on various modalities in thoracic imaging for the diagnosis of COVID-19 and describe an algorithm on how to use these resources optimally, in accordance with the guidelines and statements released by major imaging societies.

### What clinical and laboratory parameters determine significant intra abdominal pathology for patients assessed in hospital with acute abdominal pain [^116oZzjU]. World journal of emergency surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Early diagnostic laparoscopy and treatment result in accurate, prompt, and efficient management of acute abdominal pain. This technique reduces the rate of unnecessary laparotomy and right iliac fossa gridiron incisions while increasing the diagnostic accuracy in these patients; however, this approach is expensive, with significant use of resources and potential morbidity. Diagnostic laparoscopy also avoids extensive preoperative investigations and averts delays in operative management. Morino et al. assessed the role of diagnostic laparoscopy and concluded that laparoscopy compared with clinical observation did not show a clear benefit in women with non-specific abdominal pain. They reported a higher number of diagnoses and a shorter hospital stay in the laparoscopy group.

In another study, patients who have no evidence of guarding, normal temperature, and normal white cell count were observed. This practice is proven to reduce the rate of negative appendectomy. Non-specific abdominal pain is the most common diagnosis in patients admitted with acute abdominal pain (25–35% of all patients); only a quarter of those patients need surgical intervention. Clinical scores developed to recognize acute appendicitis are useful, but those scores can only be used with clinical judgment. If there is any suspicion of serious pathology, the patient should undergo a diagnostic laparoscopy.

The study shows the likely groups of patients with non-specific abdominal pain are those with normal white cell count, no history of vomiting, and absent signs of serious pathology.

### Thoracic imaging tests for the diagnosis of COVID-19 [^115tHaAc]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Low credibility.

Thoracic imaging may play an integral role in "ruling out" COVID‐19 pneumonia when RT‐PCR is unavailable, pending, or negative, or when clinical suspicion is "low" based on other signs, symptoms, and routine laboratory tests. Its role in testing involves triaging for RT‐PCR to make decisions about performing or not performing RT‐PCR or other diagnostic tests.

Rapid testing - Thoracic imaging is used to rule in or rule out COVID‐19 when results from other tests (e.g. RT‐PCR) are not available in a timely manner. It can be employed concurrently or in combination with other diagnostic tests as part of a pair or group to improve the accuracy of diagnosis. For example, thoracic imaging could help identify false negatives of other tests (e.g. RT‐PCR) and enhance the overall accuracy of the testing strategy.

Several diagnostic pathways have been proposed to guide physicians in identifying individuals with COVID‐19. These pathways differ in order and components, depending on pre-test probability, physical examination, laboratory tests, and findings based on RT‐PCR results and availability. Some professional organizations recommend imaging for patients with moderate or severe features of COVID‐19 [Rubin 2020]. In certain hospitals, low‐dose chest CT results are one of many parameters, alongside molecular test results, routine laboratory results, and clinical signs and symptoms, used to categorize patients as low risk, moderate to high risk, and confirmed COVID‐19 cases [China National Health Commission 2020].

### Ovarian torsion in a pediatric patient: The importance of repeat imaging [^1141WNST]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2019). Low credibility.

A previously healthy 10-year-old girl presented to the emergency department with a one-day history of abdominal pain. She was afebrile with an elevated white blood cell count and a negative pelvic ultrasound. The pain resolved while in the hospital, and the patient was discharged home. The patient returned 10 days later, and the pain had migrated from the left flank to the subumbilical region. She had an elevated white blood cell count and C-reactive protein. On pelvic ultrasound, there was a large midline mass and a normal right ovary. In the operating room, she was found to have a torted and necrotic left ovary and fallopian tube, which were removed. There are few instances where pediatric ovarian torsion presents as intermittent episodes of abdominal pain. Emergency physicians should always have a high index of suspicion for ovarian torsion in any case of abdominal/pelvic pain in young girls with previous negative imaging.

### ACR appropriateness criteria acute nonlocalized abdominal pain [^114uoLGH]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

The range of pathology in adults that can produce abdominal pain is broad and necessitates an imaging approach to evaluate many different organ systems. Although localizing pain prompts directed imaging and management, clinical presentations may vary and result in nonlocalized symptoms. This review focuses on imaging the adult population with nonlocalized abdominal pain, including patients with fever, recent abdominal surgery, or neutropenia.

Imaging of the entire abdomen and pelvis is essential to evaluate for infectious or inflammatory processes of the abdominal viscera and solid organs, abdominal and pelvic neoplasms, and to screen for ischemic or vascular etiologies for prompt diagnosis and treatment. CT is often the first-line modality to quickly evaluate the abdomen/pelvis, enabling accurate diagnoses and management of patients with abdominal pain. Ultrasound and tailored MRI protocols may be useful as first-line imaging studies, especially in pregnant patients. In the postoperative abdomen, fluoroscopy may help detect anastomotic leaks and abscesses. While often performed, abdominal radiographs may not alter management.

The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies, such as the RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation.

### Approach to abdominal imaging in 2022 [^111Gw6LE]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2021). Low credibility.

Abdominal pain represents 5% to 7% of all emergency department presentations. Many patients require imaging for diagnosis, and choosing the appropriate imaging modality is a crucial decision point. Modern medicine offers a fantastic array of options, including abdominal radiograph, computed tomography, MRI, and ultrasonography. However, the plethora of alternatives can be paralyzing. This article introduces the commonly available modalities, discusses the advantages and disadvantages, and presents recommendations for commonly diagnosed conditions.

### Imaging strategies for detection of urgent conditions in patients with acute abdominal pain: Diagnostic accuracy study [^1159KirJ]. BMJ (2009). Low credibility.

The fully paired study design, which involved all imaging tests being conducted on all patients with the panel-based final diagnosis as the reference standard, facilitated a comparison of the diagnostic accuracy of multiple imaging strategies. The single imaging strategies compared were: (1) diagnosis after clinical evaluation, (2) clinical diagnosis plus plain radiographs, (3) ultrasonography in all patients, and (4) CT in all patients. Additionally, we evaluated the following conditional ultrasonography and CT strategies: (5) ultrasonography first in all patients followed by CT in those with negative or inconclusive ultrasonography, and (6) ultrasonography in all patients with CT only for those with inconclusive ultrasonography.

Further, we investigated imaging strategies based on patient characteristics, where only selected patients would initially undergo ultrasonography, followed by CT following a negative or inconclusive ultrasonography; all others would start with CT. For these strategies, (7) younger patients (< 45 years) were selected due to the higher risk associated with ionizing radiation, and (8) non-obese patients (body mass index < 30 kg/m²) in whom ultrasonography is more likely to yield diagnostic results. Another strategy (9) incorporated both younger and non-obese patients starting with initial ultrasonography.

A prevalent clinical perspective is that the choice of imaging for acute abdominal pain should be guided by the pain's location. Thus, we examined strategies in which the selection of ultrasonography or CT was dependent on the abdominal quadrant where the pain presented.

### Imaging strategies for detection of urgent conditions in patients with acute abdominal pain: Diagnostic accuracy study [^116cenKo]. BMJ (2009). Low credibility.

For a diagnostic study to impact clinical practice, the results should be obtained in a representative population and setting. This multicenter study closely mimicked daily practice; a large number of residents and radiological observers, with varying levels of experience, participated. The multicenter setting included university and teaching hospitals. We believe that our results reflect the performance of imaging strategies in daily practice and are relevant to physicians managing patients with acute abdominal pain.

Use of imaging has been widely investigated for the two most common causes of acute abdominal pain: acute appendicitis and diverticulitis. In patients with suspected diverticulitis, imaging is helpful in detecting complications to assist in therapeutic decisions. For suspected acute appendicitis, extensive use of CT has been shown to reduce rates of negative appendectomy and lower overall hospital costs by preventing unnecessary admissions and surgical explorations. Although imaging in general showed a positive effect on patient outcomes in acute appendicitis, the ideal diagnostic strategy for acute appendicitis remains a matter of debate, as imaging might not be necessary for certain presentations.

In unselected patients with acute abdominal pain, studies have shown that the use of diagnostic imaging positively affects the clinical diagnosis and influences decisions on management. Diagnostic laparoscopy has also been shown to be an accurate investigation in patients with acute abdominal pain.

### CT imaging findings of epiploic appendagitis: An unusual cause of abdominal pain [^112pgiSH]. Insights into Imaging (2019). Low credibility.

The clinical diagnosis of epiploic appendagitis is challenging due to the lack of pathognomonic clinical signs or laboratory markers. Clinical presentation may vary among patients. This condition is often an underestimated and overlooked mimicker, easily misdiagnosed with other causes of abdominal pain requiring urgent care or surgical evaluation in the emergency department, particularly acute diverticulitis (left iliac pain) or acute appendicitis (right iliac pain). On physical examination, patients complain of focal non-migratory abdominal pain in the lower abdominal quadrants (left more commonly than right), not exacerbated by physical movement, without significant guarding or rigidity, and in the absence of a palpable mass. The pain is typically circumscribed, and the patient may often point to the place where the lesion is situated. Patients may also report postprandial fullness, swelling, vomiting, early satiety, diarrhea, and rarely mild fever. White blood cell count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and C-reactive protein levels are within normal range in the majority of patients, while mild leukocytosis may occasionally be observed due to inflammatory response.

Epiploic appendagitis is a benign, self-limiting condition which spontaneously resolves within 2 weeks from the onset of symptoms. Surgery is not indicated, since the treatment is conservative with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, according to the patient's symptoms. The risk of recurrence is low, and complications are even rarer.

### Imaging and laboratory testing in acute abdominal pain [^112p7nKs]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

When discussing which laboratory tests or imaging to order in the setting of acute abdominal pain, it is practical to organize information by disease process (e.g. acute appendicitis, cholecystitis). Because studies on the accuracy of diagnostic tests are necessarily related to the presence or absence of specific diagnoses, and because clinicians frequently look to tests to help them rule in or rule out specific conditions, this article is organized by region of pain and common abdominal diagnoses. It focuses on the contributions that laboratory testing and imaging make in the emergency management of abdominal complaints.

### Overuse of diagnostic testing in healthcare: A systematic review [^111uh77F]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2022). Low credibility.

Finally, the use of different methods to assess overuse can explain the observed differences in outcomes. Some articles used the method as proposed by Schwartz et al, which suggests using narrow (high specificity and low sensitivity) and broad indicators (low specificity and high sensitivity) to assess low-value care. Narrow definitions are more tightly formulated, resulting in a more distinct cohort of patients/services that is included, as compared with the cohorts created using broad definitions. Through a combination of both assessments, a more complete understanding of the problem is obtained.

However, while using both narrow and broad indicators appears to be a good way to provide an estimate of the amount of overuse of low-value practices, it was only employed in three of the included articles. In our analysis, we only used the broad assessments from those studies since the underlying definitions more closely resembled the original recommendations. Therefore, broad assessment outcomes are more suitable for comparison to the outcomes of studies that directly used the relevant original recommendations in their assessments.

### Did medical doctors who order abdominal CT scans during on-call hours truly become worse at clinical reasoning? Yes, they did [^112Cgfu4]. European Radiology (2023). Low credibility.

Experts in the field of abdominal imaging have reported that many patients with acute abdominal pain are referred for imaging without a clear pretest diagnosis, and only a small proportion of patients can receive a confident and accurate diagnosis based solely on medical history, physical examination, and laboratory test findings. These expert statements align with the findings of the present study.

Previous studies have also shown a rise in the use of cross-sectional imaging, particularly CT and MRI in adults, including abdominal CT utilization during on-call hours. These findings are consistent with the results of the present study. However, studies investigating temporal changes in the clinical reasoning quality of physicians who request cross-sectional imaging have been lacking thus far.

The present study had some limitations. First, this study was conducted in a tertiary care center in a Western European country without any CT scan capacity issues. The results may differ in other hospitals with different patient populations and CT scan capacities. It should also be noted that 61.6% of patients in this study were male, for which we do not have a clear explanation. Second, the results only apply to acute abdominal CT scans performed during on-call hours. Further research is necessary to determine if our findings also apply to other clinical settings where cross-sectional imaging is requested. Third, it can be argued that the CT request forms may not have contained all clinical reasoning details, which could have influenced assessment accuracy.

### The diagnostic yield of head and neck imaging in symptomatic patients with a normal clinical examination [^112qAqiy]. Head & Neck (2022). Low credibility.

Nationally, concern has been raised about the overuse of diagnostic testing. In patients with unilateral otalgia and no history of head and neck cancer (HNC), 1% had a malignancy detected on imaging that was not detected on clinical examination.

- **Methods**: We performed a retrospective review of "MRI soft tissue neck" scans performed at our hospital from May 2020 to May 2021. Patients were excluded if their scan was not ordered for HNC symptoms. Previous HNC patients undergoing follow-up imaging were also included.

- **Results**: In total, 326 scan requests were analyzed. Of the 132 patients without clinical features of overt disease, only one received a new diagnosis of HNC. This patient had previously had a HNC and was undergoing routine follow-up imaging.

- **Conclusion**: Our data demonstrate that performing MRI scans in symptomatic patients with a normal examination, FNE, and no history of HNC does not benefit the diagnosis or management of these patients.

### Defining and measuring diagnostic uncertainty in medicine: A systematic review [^114RrovE]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Diagnostic uncertainty is inherent in the practice of medicine. Patients often present with undifferentiated symptoms that change over time, making it difficult for clinicians to identify a satisfactory explanation for the patient's presenting problem. In addition to patient presentation, time constraints of the patient–clinician encounter, complexity of medical science, and limitations of diagnostic tests all influence diagnostic decisions amidst uncertainty. Described as analogous to looking for a "snowball in a blizzard", diagnostic decision-making under uncertainty is challenging for clinicians and must be appropriately managed in medical practice.

In previous studies, diagnostic uncertainty has been associated with diagnostic variation (physicians giving different diagnoses to the same patient), over-testing, unnecessary surgeries, more hospitalizations and referrals, and increased healthcare expenditure. Inappropriate management of diagnostic uncertainty could contribute to diagnostic errors or excess healthcare utilization. Recent estimates suggest that at least 1 in 20 outpatients experience a diagnostic error (missed, delayed, or incorrect diagnoses) each year, sometimes with devastating consequences. Additionally, rising costs related to diagnostic testing have led to recommendations for cost-containment, requiring physicians to carefully consider the resources they use and diagnostic decisions they make in the midst of uncertainty. Thus, inappropriate management of diagnostic uncertainty can impact both system and patient outcomes.
