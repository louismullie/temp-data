## Question

Mechanism of action dobutamine

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about dobutamine's mechanism of action. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the drug class and receptor pharmacology. Then, I should verify the intracellular signaling cascade and how it translates into contractile effects. Next, I will examine the hemodynamic consequences, including inotropy, chronotropy, and vascular effects. After that, I need to check pharmacokinetics and metabolism because they shape onset/offset and dosing. Finally, I will consider clinical implications, exceptions, and safety, and I will double-check any points that seem contradictory before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the drug class and receptor profile. Dobutamine is a synthetic catecholamine and a direct-acting inotropic agent whose primary activity is stimulation of cardiac beta-1 adrenergic receptors, with comparatively mild effects at beta-2 and alpha-1 receptors, and importantly, it does not rely on presynaptic norepinephrine release, unlike dopamine, which distinguishes its mechanism at the synaptic level [^02b4be12] [^19a78c54] [^993850af].

> Wait, let me verify the intracellular signaling cascade. Beta-1 receptor activation couples to Gs protein, which activates adenylate cyclase, increases cAMP, activates protein kinase A, phosphorylates L-type calcium channels, increases sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium release, and sensitizes troponin C to calcium, thereby enhancing myocardial contractility; this cAMP-dependent pathway is the canonical mechanism for beta-agonist inotropy and is consistently described across authoritative sources [^02b4be12] [^19a78c54] [^993850af].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about hemodynamics without separating inotropy from chronotropy. The dominant effect is positive inotropy with increased stroke volume and cardiac output, while chronotropic effects are comparatively mild at usual doses; in patients with depressed function, dobutamine increases output primarily via stroke volume rather than heart rate, which is a key advantage over isoproterenol, where output gains are driven more by heart rate with little change or decline in stroke volume [^02b4be12] [^19a78c54] [^993850af].

> I need to check the vascular effects carefully. Beta-2–mediated vasodilation tends to lower systemic vascular resistance, though this is balanced by mild alpha-1 activity, so the net effect is typically vasodilation with occasional minimal vasoconstriction; clinically, this translates to afterload reduction and can improve stroke volume, but I should confirm that this vasodilatory property can precipitate hypotension in preload-dependent states or when combined with other vasodilators [^02b4be12] [^19a78c54] [^993850af].

> Let me consider pharmacokinetics because they drive bedside titration. Onset is within 1–2 minutes, but peak effect at a given infusion rate may take up to 10 minutes; the plasma half-life is about 2 minutes due to rapid metabolism by catechol-O-methyltransferase to 3-O-methyl-dobutamine, which is inactive, and conjugation pathways contribute to clearance; this short half-life supports careful titration and rapid reversal upon discontinuation, which I should emphasize for safety [^63130c49] [^de7fc666] [^19a78c54].

> Next, I should review clinical implications and exceptions. In heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, dobutamine augments contractility and output while reducing filling pressures, but prolonged or routine use is discouraged due to lack of mortality benefit and potential harm signals in chronic settings; in septic shock with cardiac dysfunction, guidelines suggest adding dobutamine to norepinephrine when hypoperfusion persists despite adequate volume and blood pressure, though evidence quality is low and both agents should be stopped if ineffective or harmful [^5919515f] [^7ddd43c4] [^8a44416b].

> But wait, what if the patient is on beta-blockers; does dobutamine still work? I initially thought beta-blockade would uniformly blunt dobutamine's inotropy, and older teaching suggested phosphodiesterase inhibitors might be preferable in that scenario; however, hold on, I should verify newer data. The DOREMI trial and subsequent analyses in cardiogenic shock suggest that baseline beta-blocker use does not markedly impair hemodynamic response to dobutamine, likely due to high endogenous catecholamine tone in shock states, so I need to correct that overgeneralization and individualize agent selection rather than assume catecholamine failure in all beta-blocked patients [^3f36dd83] [^39d2efe1] [^252144f5].

> I should double-check safety and monitoring. Excessive beta-receptor stimulation can cause sinus tachycardia, ectopy, and ventricular arrhythmias, and dobutamine increases myocardial oxygen demand, so continuous ECG and blood pressure monitoring are essential; in patients with outflow obstruction such as hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, dobutamine is contraindicated because it can worsen obstruction; additionally, rare coronary spasm has been reported during dobutamine stress testing, particularly in patients with vasospastic angina, so vigilance for ischemia is prudent [^d7cf2589] [^d924f932] [^e8632171].

> Let me reconsider the overall mechanism to ensure internal consistency. Dobutamine's net clinical effect is a direct, cAMP-mediated positive inotropy with modest chronotropy, mild vasodilation with occasional alpha-1 offset, and a very short half-life enabling tight titration; this profile explains why it remains a first-line inotrope in many shock and low-output states, while recognizing that evidence for hard outcomes is limited and that we should use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration with close monitoring and prompt de-escalation when goals are not met [^02b4be12] [^19a78c54] [^993850af].

Dobutamine is a **direct-acting β1-adrenergic agonist** [^02b4be12] that increases myocardial contractility and stroke volume with minimal chronotropic effect, thereby raising cardiac output [^19a78c54]. It also has mild β2 activity causing vasodilation and reducing afterload, with little α1 effect, so systemic vascular resistance typically falls [^02b4be12]. These effects are rapid (onset 1–2 min, peak 10 min) and short-lived (half-life ~2 min) [^63130c49], requiring continuous infusion and careful titration to balance inotropy with arrhythmia risk [^02b4be12].

---

## Pharmacological classification and receptor selectivity

Dobutamine is a **synthetic catecholamine** [^f193590f] with predominant β1-adrenergic agonism, lesser β2 activity, and minimal α1 effect [^02b4be12]. This profile yields strong inotropy with modest chronotropy and vasodilation, distinguishing it from dopamine and epinephrine [^02b4be12].

| **Receptor subtype** | **Effect** | **Clinical consequence** |
|-|-|-|
| β1 (heart) | Positive inotropy | Increased contractility and stroke volume |
| β2 (vasculature) | Vasodilation | Reduced afterload and SVR |
| α1 (vasculature) | Minimal effect | Little vasoconstriction |

---

## Molecular mechanism of action

- **Β1-receptor activation**: Increases cAMP via Gs-protein/adenylyl cyclase, enhancing calcium influx and sarcoplasmic reticulum release, which augments contractility [^02b4be12].
- **Β2-receptor activation**: Produces vasodilation, lowering SVR and afterload, aiding stroke volume [^02b4be12].
- **Α1 effect**: Minimal, so net vascular effect is vasodilation rather than vasoconstriction [^02b4be12].

---

## Hemodynamic effects

- **Cardiac output**: Increases primarily via stroke volume, with modest heart rate rise [^02b4be12].
- **Stroke volume**: Increases due to stronger contractility and reduced afterload [^02b4be12].
- **Heart rate**: Mild increase; less than isoproterenol for a given inotropic effect [^02b4be12].
- **Systemic vascular resistance**: Decreases from β2-mediated vasodilation [^02b4be12].
- **Blood pressure**: Typically rises from improved cardiac output, though vasodilation can blunt this [^02b4be12].

---

## Pharmacokinetics

- **Onset**: 1–2 minutes; peak effect in ~10 minutes [^63130c49].
- **Half-life**: ~2 minutes, enabling rapid titration and reversal [^63130c49].
- **Metabolism**: Methylation and conjugation; inactive 3-O-methyl metabolite [^63130c49].
- **Excretion**: Urine as conjugates and inactive metabolites [^63130c49].

---

## Clinical implications and considerations

- **Indications**: Short-term inotropic support in acute decompensated heart failure, cardiogenic shock, and low-output states [^d327e8c4] [^f03882e6].
- **Advantages**: Rapid titration, strong inotropy with less tachycardia than isoproterenol, and afterload reduction [^02b4be12].
- **Limitations**: Arrhythmias, myocardial ischemia, and tachyphylaxis with prolonged use; monitor ECG and hemodynamics closely [^967fab81] [^97146223].

---

Dobutamine's mechanism centers on **β1-mediated inotropy** with β2 vasodilation, yielding increased stroke volume and cardiac output with modest chronotropy and afterload reduction; its short half-life supports careful titration in acute care settings [^02b4be12] [^63130c49].

### Dobutamine for patients with severe heart failure: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^6883f548]. Intensive Care Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose

Dobutamine is recommended for patients with severe heart failure; however uncertainty exists as to its effect on mortality. This study aims to critically review the literature to evaluate whether dobutamine, compared with placebo or standard care, is associated with lower mortality and a range of secondary outcomes, in patients with severe heart failure.

Methods

A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials was performed. PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Trials Registry, the metaRegister of Controlled Trials and bibliographies of retrieved articles were searched. Randomised trials comparing dobutamine with placebo or standard care, in human, adult patients with severe heart failure, were included if they reported at least one outcome of interest. Data regarding trial validity, methodological processes and clinical outcomes were extracted, and a meta-analysis was performed.

Results

Fourteen studies, with 673 participants, met the inclusion criteria and were included; 13 studies reported mortality. There was minimal heterogeneity (I² = 4.5%). The estimate of the odds ratio for mortality for patients with severe heart failure treated with dobutamine compared with standard care or placebo was 1.47 (95% confidence interval 0.98–2.21, p = 0.06).

Conclusions

This meta-analysis showed that dobutamine is not associated with improved mortality in patients with heart failure, and there is a suggestion of increased mortality associated with its use, although this did not reach the conventional level of statistical significance. Further research to define the role of dobutamine in treatment of severe heart failure should be a priority.

### Dobutamine hydrochloride [^02b4be12]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Dobutamine hydrochloride is a direct-acting inotropic agent whose primary activity results from stimulation of the beta-receptors of the heart while producing comparatively mild chronotropic, hypertensive, arrhythmogenic, and vasodilative effects. It does not cause the release of endogenous norepinephrine, as does dopamine. In animal studies, dobutamine produces less increase in heart rate and less decrease in peripheral vascular resistance for a given inotropic effect than does isoproterenol.

In patients with depressed cardiac function, both dobutamine and isoproterenol increase the cardiac output to a similar degree. In the case of dobutamine, this increase is usually not accompanied by marked increases in heart rate (although tachycardia is occasionally observed), and the cardiac stroke volume is usually increased. In contrast, isoproterenol increases the cardiac index primarily by increasing the heart rate while stroke volume changes little or declines.

Facilitation of atrioventricular conduction has been observed in human electrophysiologic studies and in patients with atrial fibrillation.

Systemic vascular resistance is usually decreased with administration of dobutamine. Occasionally, minimum vasoconstriction has been observed.

Most clinical experience with dobutamine is short-term - not more than several hours in duration. In the limited number of patients who were studied for 24, 48, and 72 hours, a persistent increase in cardiac output occurred in some, whereas output returned toward baseline values in others.

### A literature review of the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of dobutamine in neonates [^d6f12318]. Pediatric Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

Since its discovery in 1975 dobutamine has been used off-label for treating hemodynamic insufficiency in newborns and children. We present a structured literature review of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data for dobutamine in the pediatric population. Structured searches were conducted to identify relevant articles according to pre-defined inclusion criteria. Where possible, results for the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic effect of dobutamine were reported as pooled data. Forty-six papers met the inclusion criteria. With regard to pharmacodynamic data a number of studies reported significant increases in a number of clinical parameters such as heart rate, blood pressure, cardiac output across a wide range of pediatric populations. With regard to pharmacokinetic data studies reported that the infusion rate was positively correlated to plasma dobutamine concentration. There was great variability with regard to dobutamine clearance between individuals and as to whether it followed first- or zero-order elimination kinetics. While the pharmacodynamic effects of dobutamine appear to reflect the pharmacological profile of the drug, the pharmacokinetic data are difficult to interpret due to inhomogeneity between study populations ages, comorbidities, dobutamine dosages and methodologies. High-quality prospective pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data especially in newborns are urgently required prior to a large randomized study.

Regarding the use of dobutamine IV in pregnant patients for all trimesters: use only if benefits outweigh potential risks. The drug dobutamine IV is classified under category B2 in the Australian categorisation system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. This drug has been taken by only a limited number of pregnant women and women of childbearing age, without an increase in the frequency of malformation or other direct or indirect harmful effects on the human foetus having been observed. Studies in animals are inadequate or may be lacking, but available data show no evidence of an increased occurrence of foetal damage.

### Inotropes and β-blockers: is there a need for new guidelines? [^41ebc0e7]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2001). Low credibility.

Beta-adrenergic blocking agents are standard treatment for patients with mild-to-moderate heart failure. When patients receiving beta-blockers decompensate they often need treatment with a positive inotropic agent. The beta-agonist dobutamine may not produce much increase in cardiac output during full-dose beta-blocker treatment and may increase systemic vascular resistance via alpha-adrenergic stimulation. In contrast, phosphodiesterase inhibitors (PDEIs) such as milrinone or enoximone retain full hemodynamic effects during complete beta-blockade because the site of action of PDEIs is beyond the beta-adrenergic receptor and because beta-blockade reverses some of the desensitization phenomena that account for the attenuation of PDEI response in heart failure related to upregulation in G(alphai). Inotrope-requiring subjects with decompensated heart failure who are undergoing long-term therapy with beta-blocking agents should be treated with a type III-specific PDEI, not a beta-agonist such as dobutamine.

### Dobutamine hydrochloride [^5919515f]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS & USAGE

Dobutamine Hydrochloride in 5% Dextrose Injection is indicated when parenteral therapy is necessary for inotropic support in the short-term treatment of patients with cardiac decompensation due to depressed contractility resulting either from organic heart disease or from cardiac surgical procedures. Experience with intravenous dobutamine in controlled trials does not extend beyond 48 hours of repeated boluses and/or continuous infusions.

Whether given orally, continuously intravenously, or intermittently intravenously, neither dobutamine nor any other cyclic-AMP-dependent inotrope has been shown in controlled trials to be safe or effective in the long-term treatment of congestive heart failure. In controlled trials of chronic oral therapy with various such agents, symptoms were not consistently alleviated, and the cyclic-AMP-dependent inotropes were consistently associated with increased risks of hospitalization and death. Patients with NYHA Class IV symptoms appeared to be at particular risk.

### My paper 20 years later: effects of dobutamine on the VO₂/DO₂ relationship [^7fbb3f47]. Intensive Care Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Oxygen uptake (VO₂) is independent of oxygen delivery (DO₂) over a wide range of values, because Ov extraction can readily adapt to changes in DO₂. However, VO₂ can become DO₂-dependent in acute circulatory failure.

Methods

Various methods of evaluating the presence of VO₂/DO₂ dependency were conducted, but criticized because of potential problems with mathematical coupling of data. Some 20 years ago, we proposed using a dobutamine test and showed similar relationships using direct and indirect measurements. Since these studies on the systemic VO₂/DO₂ relationship, investigators have also explored regional alterations.

Conclusion

The relationship between VO₂ and DO₂ remains an important concept. Abnormal global VO₂/DO₂ dependency does not exist in stable, critically ill patients, but can exist in circulatory shock of all etiologies. It can also occur regionally in septic patients, and microcirculatory alterations may contribute. Patient management should be titrated individually with careful assessment to identify those who will benefit from increased DO₂.

### Effects of intravenous dobutamine on coronary vasomotion in humans [^5c62bf47]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

Objectives

We sought to investigate the vascular mechanisms of dobutamine-induced myocardial ischemia.

Background

Dobutamine stress is often used as a surrogate for exercise. The effects of dobutamine on the epicardial arteries are incompletely understood and possibly different from those of physical exercise.

Methods

Intravenous (IV) dobutamine (40 microg/kg per min) was administered in 19 patients with normal, 23 patients with mildly atherosclerotic, and 12 patients with stenotic coronary arteries. In another two groups of patients with stenotic arteries, IV dobutamine was preceded by 1) an intracoronary (IC) bolus of the alpha-adrenergic blocker phentolamine (12 microg/kg, n = 12); and 2) an IC infusion of the nitric oxide substrate L-arginine (150 micromol/l per min for 20 min, n = 11). Intravenous saline instead of dobutamine was infused into eight patients with normal arteries. After dobutamine (or saline), an IC bolus of isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN, 0.2 mg) was given. Coronary vasomotion was evaluated by quantitative coronary angiography on angiograms obtained after each dose of dobutamine, saline, phentolamine, L-arginine, and ISDN.

Results

Dobutamine increased the rate-pressure product and heart rate similarly in all patients except those who received saline. Dobutamine induced vasodilation in normal (change in luminal diameter [DeltaLD] vs. baseline: 19 ± 2%) and in mildly atherosclerotic arteries (DeltaLD: 8 ± 2%, p < 0.05 vs. normal). In stenotic arteries, dobutamine did not induce significant vasomotion (DeltaLD: -3 ± 3%); the latter was improved by L-arginine (DeltaLD: 10 ± 3%, p < 0.05 vs. stenotic arteries) and fully restored by phentolamine (DeltaLD: 19 ± 3%, p < 0.05 vs. stenotic arteries).

Conclusions

Endothelial dysfunction and enhanced alpha-adrenergic tone contribute to the loss of dobutamine-induced vasodilation in coronary atherosclerosis. In contrast to physical exercise, dobutamine does not induce "paradoxical vasoconstriction" of atherosclerotic coronary arteries.

### Why has positive inotropy failed in chronic heart failure? Lessons from prior inotrope trials [^a08f761a]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2019). Medium credibility.

A brief history of inotropic agents and their impact on surrogate endpoints

Within the syndrome of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, there is a growing subgroup of patients who have worsening disease that is typified by signs and symptoms of hypotension and hypoperfusion. 7 These patients, characterized as having stage D heart failure, are increasingly unable to tolerate neurohormonal blockade, and their options are limited to cardiac transplantation, ventricular assist devices, inotropic infusions, or hospice. 8 The primary pathology in these patients is thought to be a decrease in cardiac contractility and the development of positive inotropes has been aimed at correcting this defect: almost every inotropic agent that survived to clinical evaluation has shared a common therapeutic goal: to increase the amplitude of cytosolic calcium transients or sensitivity of the sarcomere, thus increasing the force of contraction.

The first of these was dobutamine, created in 1975 by modifying the chemical structure of isoproterenol to reduce its chronotropic, arrhythmogenic, and vascular side effects. This increased its action on the β 1 cardiac receptors whilst minimizing the impact on the α 1 and β 2 vascular receptors. Mechanistically, dobutamine appeared to provide the beneficial aspects of adrenergic signalling in heart failure while bypassing deleterious peripheral vasoconstriction: increasing stroke volume and decreasing systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure.

A string of phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors were subsequently developed, including amrinone and followed by milrinone and enoximone, all of which worked downstream to the β 1 cardiac adrenergic receptors by inhibiting the enzyme (PDE‐3), one of those role is to catalyse the breakdown of cAMP and leading to an increased intracellular calcium. 9, 10, 11, 12 The most prominent of the PDE inhibitors was milrinone; both its intravenous and oral forms improved cardiac haemodynamics in heart failure patients. 13 Phase 2 clinical trials of other PDE inhibitors, such as amrinone and enoximone, also improved haemodynamics and exercise capacity in patients with advanced heart failure. 9, 14

Pharmacologic stress testing (dobutamine) — In patients who cannot exercise, dobutamine and vasodilator stress are alternatives, and although vasodilators may have advantages for assessment of myocardial perfusion, dobutamine is preferred when the test is based on assessment of regional wall motion. A graded dobutamine infusion starting at 5 μg/kg/min and increasing at 3-minute intervals to 10, 20, 30, and 40 μg/kg/min is the standard for dobutamine stress testing, and inclusion of low-dose stages facilitates recognition of viability and ischemia in segments with abnormal function at rest, even if viability assessment is not the main objective of the test. End points are achievement of target heart rate (defined as 85% of the age-predicted maximum heart rate), new or worsening wall-motion abnormalities of moderate degree, significant arrhythmias, hypotension, severe hypertension, and intolerable symptoms. Atropine, in divided doses of 0.25 to 0.5 mg to a total of 2.0 mg, should be used as needed to achieve target heart rate, increases the sensitivity of dobutamine echocardiography in patients receiving beta-blockers and in those with single-vessel disease, and the minimum cumulative dose needed should be used to avoid the rare complication of central nervous system toxicity. Patients given atropine at the 30-μg/kg/min stage reach target heart rate more quickly using lower doses of dobutamine and with fewer side effects; a beta-blocker may be administered to reverse the side effects of dobutamine, and administration of beta-blockers at peak stress or during recovery may increase test sensitivity. Both dobutamine and exercise echocardiography result in a marked increase of heart rate, but the increment in systolic blood pressure is much less with dobutamine compared with exercise.

Therapies for heart failure — agent definitions are provided for inotropes/pressors used in practice: Milrinone is a phosphodiesterase 3 inhibitor that works to increase the heart's contractility and decrease pulmonary vascular resistance; Dobutamine is a direct-acting inotropic agent whose primary activity results from stimulation of the beta receptors of the heart while producing comparatively mild chronotropic, hypertensive, arrhythmogenic, and vasodilative effects; Norepinephrine is a sympathomimetic amine that increases blood pressure and enhances ventricular contractility; Epinephrine, when injected into an intravenous fluid solution, increases blood pressure, coronary artery pressure, thereby promoting increased coronary blood flow and ventricular contractility; and Dopamine at low doses acts through the sympathetic nervous system to increase heart muscle contraction force and heart rate, thereby increasing cardiac output and blood pressure, while at higher doses, causes vasoconstriction that further increases blood pressure.

Dobutamine stress echocardiography — viability assessment and dosing protocols are described as follows: An initial infusion of dobutamine at 2.5 μg/kg/ min, with gradual increase to 5, 7.5, 10, and 20 μg/kg/ min, is frequently used, and functional improvement without untoward side effects may prompt escalation of the drip rate to 40 μg/kg/ min and, if needed, atropine injection. Dysfunctional myocardium responses include biphasic response, sustained improvement, worsening of function, and no change in function; the highest sensitivity for detection of viability is noted when improvement at low-dose dobutamine echocardiography is considered, whereas highest specificity is achieved when a biphasic response occurs. Reported accuracy shows sensitivity ranging from 71% to 97% and specificity from 63% to 95%; patients with a large area of viable myocardium (> 25% of LV) have a high likelihood of improvement in EF and a better outcome after revascularization, and it is recommended that improvement by at least one grade in two or more segments be demonstrated.

### Dobutamine-induced alternations in cerebral blood flow of healthy adults: a 3D pseudocontinuous arterial spin labeling study [^3069111b]. BMC Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinically, dobutamine has been suggested to be associated with increased CBF in patients. In contrast, another study reported that dobutamine caused a decrease in CBF in five patients based on transcranial color Doppler imaging (TCDI). Moreover, a further study using TCDI on ten healthy volunteers showed that dobutamine did not significantly change cerebrovascular homeostasis. In comparison, an animal experimental study in a model of subarachnoid hemorrhage, in which CBF was acquired with continuous arterial spin labeling (ASL), showed that acute cardiac support with dobutamine administration improved hypoperfusion. The contradictory results of these studies reflect the complex mechanisms of action of dobutamine.

To date, the effects of dobutamine on CBF, as well as its influencing factors, have been explored using different techniques and in patients or animals with different diseases. However, it is important to consider the variations between the CBF measurement techniques when interpreting the data. In the earlier studies, CO, blood pressure, and HR were altered using different doses of dobutamine, and CBF was measured using TCDI or MRI. It is possible that methodological heterogeneity may result in inconsistent results, particularly in patients with cerebrovascular diseases. Therefore, the effects of dobutamine on CBF in both patients and healthy subjects remain unclear and are probably complex, influenced by CO, blood pressure, and cerebral blood vessel morphology. Moreover, changes in microcirculatory behavior in the brains of healthy subjects after dobutamine infusion may occur even with normal systemic hemodynamics and could contribute to hypoperfusion or hyperperfusion. From a clinical perspective, dobutamine is widely used to increase blood pressure and CO, but these effects may be accompanied by a risk of death, especially when high doses of dobutamine are administered. Therefore, the effect of dobutamine on cerebral hemodynamics should be considered.

### Cardiovascular response to dobutamine stress predicts outcome in severe sepsis and septic shock [^0aba62b8]. Critical Care (2008). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Although a variety of dobutamine-stimulated cardiovascular and ventricular responses are associated with outcome in sepsis and septic shock, SVI increases are most strongly correlated with survival. Since this stimulation test involves transient administration of dobutamine, this response is probably indicative of preservation of cardiac signalling mechanisms and of cardiovascular reserve in the septic patient. Notably, the predictive strength of these responses is substantially more powerful than that generated by initial HR, the only baseline haemodynamic index associated with outcome.

Further research is required to better understand the mechanisms underlying differing cardiovascular responses during severe sepsis and septic shock both at baseline and under exogenous catecholamine stress.

COVID-19 supportive care inotropes — milrinone and dobutamine are defined as follows: Milrinone is a phosphodiesterase 3 inhibitor that works to increase the heart's contractility, decrease pulmonary vascular resistance, and functions as a systemic vasodilator, while dobutamine is a direct-acting inotropic agent whose primary activity results from stimulation of the β receptors of the heart and produces comparatively mild chronotropic, hypertensive, arrhythmogenic, and vasodilative effects.

### Effects of dobutamine and phenylephrine on cerebral perfusion in patients undergoing cerebral bypass surgery: a randomised crossover trial [^e5205ffa]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2020). Medium credibility.

We cannot definitively conclude that dobutamine administration benefits all patients presenting for cerebral bypass surgery. Still, this study does show that dobutamine can increase cerebral perfusion and should be considered when targeted graft flows are not reached or only at the cost of (severe) systemic hypertension, when using phenylephrine. Inotropes such as dobutamine can cause arrhythmia and increased myocardial oxygen demand and should be used with caution in patients with cardiac comorbidities. Although not tested in this study, norepinephrine, a combined α 1 -, α 2 -and β 1 -receptor agonist, primarily causes vasoconstriction and an increase in blood pressure, but can also (slightly) increase cardiac output and may be a good alternative to phenylephrine. Future studies should consider testing the effect of norepinephrine on cerebral blood flow and further explore the effect of an increase in cardiac output in all patients at risk of perioperative cerebral ischaemia.

### Minimizing catecholamines and optimizing perfusion [^1248ba15]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

For increasing cardiac output, dobutamine is the agent of choice. It is characterized by a short half-life and has minimal adverse effects at usual doses. In patients with septic shock, dobutamine increased oxygen delivery with minimal impact on MAP. In most cases, the increase in cardiac output was related to an increase in stroke volume more. In another trial, it was nevertheless noted that the increase in cardiac output was in some case related more to an increase in heart rate than in stroke volume. In addition, one should note that metabolic effects can be observed mostly when high doses of beta-adrenergic agents are used. Hence, one should always use the minimal dose associated with the desired hemodynamic effect and wean it as soon as possible. Non-adrenergic alternatives include phosphodiesterase inhibitors and levosimendan. Phosphodiesterase inhibitors like enoximone and milrinone are characterized by a long half-life and associate vasodilatory to the inotropic properties. Hypotension is often encountered and often limit/prevent the use of these agents in septic shock. Levosimendan, a calcium sensitizer, is an attractive alternative. Unfortunately, it is also associated with vasodilatory properties and with a very long half-life. This latter property makes this agent not optimal for therapy in septic patients as its action (positive inotropy as well as adverse effects) would remain present for 5–7 days. Of note, a prolonged effect is not desired in septic shock as myocardial depression usually resolves over a few days, and hence, indication for inotropic stimulation also disappears. In a small size trial, levosimendan was effective in increasing cardiac output and improving gastric perfusion. Even though it has limited impact on blood pressure, the amount of fluids administered was also higher in patients receiving levosimendan. In a randomized trial, levosimendan was ineffective in preventing new-onset organ dysfunction. Unfortunately, the indication to administrate levosimendan in that trial was not triggered on hemodynamic endpoints (no cardiac output measurements and no assessment of cardiac function). Indeed, as for other inotropic agents, levosimendan should only be administered in patients with tissue hypoperfusion related to an inadequate cardiac output associated with altered contractility. Accordingly, the hypothesis of whether levosimendan could improve, or not, tissue perfusion in patients with inadequate cardiac output in sepsis was not tested.

Dobutamine remains thus the inotropic agent of choice in sepsis, even though other inotropic agents may offer interesting alternatives in some conditions.

Dobutamine stress haemodynamics — systemic, LV, and contractile effects: Dobutamine increases determinants of myocardial oxygen consumption with heart rate "two‑ to three‑fold", end‑diastolic volume "1.2‑fold", and systolic arterial pressure "1.5‑ to 2.0‑fold". Myocardial contractility "increases over four‑fold in normal subjects and much less (so less than two‑fold) in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy". β‑2 receptor activation contributes to "the mild decrease in blood pressure common at higher dobutamine dose". During infusion, left ventricle (LV) end‑systolic volume decreases more than LV end‑diastolic volume while cardiac output rises, and "LV volumes and wall stress increase less with dobutamine" than with exercise.

### Management of cardiogenic shock: state-of-the-art [^7b7b196c]. Intensive Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Contractility can positively be modified using inotropes (see Fig. 2, right part), although their impact on the outcome remains a topic of ongoing debate. The choice of first-line inotropes currently used lacks a clear consensus. There is no compelling evidence supporting the efficacy of any specific inotropic therapy in reducing mortality for hemodynamically unstable patients with CS, as neither the ESC nor the AHA guidelines make definitive recommendations, emphasizing the absence of robust evidence favouring one inotrope over another. In practical terms, the use of inotropes varies widely, and retrospective analyses indicate either higher mortality rates or no discernible positive effects associated with most inotropes. Individual choices should be made as a patient and disease tailored approach. While dobutamine is commonly used as the primary agent, levosimendan and phosphodiesterase (PDE)-III inhibitors might serve as an alternative or additional option when dobutamine proves ineffective, while conflicting data exists. Recent cochrane analyses found insufficient evidence to establish the superiority of any particular vasopressor or inotrope in terms of mortality. Even though the 2016 ESC guidelines for heart failure recommended dobutamine as a "first line" inotrope, the current guidelines do not make specific recommendations. Observational studies and a recent RCT indicate favourable outcomes with dobutamine use in comparison to dopamine or epinephrine. Levosimendan, a calcium-sensitizer, increases cardiac inotropy and reduces afterload, demonstrating a long-lasting effect and potential benefits in catecholamine-refractory AMI-CS and other specific cases such as right heart failure. In addition, levosimendan might offer beneficial effects in patients with previous beta-blocker use.

### DOBUTamine injection USP Rx ONLY… [^5775fd03]. FDA (DailyMed) (2024). Medium credibility.

Dobutamine is a direct-acting inotropic agent whose primary activity results from stimulation of the ß receptors of the heart while producing comparatively mild chronotropic, hypertensive, arrhythmogenic, and vasodilative effects. It does not cause the release of endogenous norepinephrine, as does dopamine. In animal studies, dobutamine produces less increase in heart rate and less decrease in peripheral vascular resistance for a given inotropic effect than does isoproterenol. In patients with depressed cardiac function, both dobutamine and isoproterenol increase the cardiac output to a similar degree. In the case of dobutamine, this increase is usually not accompanied by marked increases in heart rate, and the cardiac stroke volume is usually increased. In contrast, isoproterenol increases the cardiac index primarily by increasing the heart rate while stroke volume changes little or declines.

Facilitation of atrioventricular conduction has been observed in human electrophysiologic studies and in patients with atrial fibrillation. Systemic vascular resistance is usually decreased with administration of dobutamine. Occasionally, minimum vasoconstriction has been observed. Most clinical experience with dobutamine is short-term–not more than several hours in duration. In the limited number of patients who were studied for 24, 48, and 72 hours, a persistent increase in cardiac output occurred in some, whereas output returned toward baseline values in others. The onset of action of dobutamine is within 1 to 2 minutes; however, as much as 10 minutes may be required to obtain the peak effect of a particular infusion rate. The plasma half-life of dobutamine in humans is 2 minutes. The principal routes of metabolism are methylation of the catechol and conjugation. In human urine, the major excretion products are the conjugates of dobutamine and 3-O-methyl dobutamine.

The 3-O-methyl derivative of dobutamine is inactive. Signs and Symptoms- Toxicity from dobutamine is usually due to excessive cardiac ß-receptor stimulation. The duration of action of dobutamine is generally short because it is rapidly metabolized by catechol-0-methyltranferase. The symptoms of toxicity may include anorexia, nausea, vomiting, tremor, anxiety, palpitations, headache, shortness of breath, and anginal and nonspecific chest pain.

Inotropes evidence and cautions in septic shock — Dobutamine and epinephrine are the most commonly used inotropes, but no randomized controlled trial (RCT) compared dobutamine to placebo and mortality effects are unclear, so the panel issued a suggestion to use inotropes only in selected situations and both should be discontinued if ineffective or harmful. Indirect comparison from network meta-analysis showed that dobutamine with norepinephrine had no clear impact on mortality compared to no inotropic agents (OR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.32 to 1.47). In an observational study of 420 patients with septic shock, inotrope use was independently associated with increased 90-day mortality (OR, 2.29; 95% CI, 1.33 to 3.94). No evidence supports the superiority of dobutamine over epinephrine, and an indirect comparison showed no clear effect on mortality (OR, 1.18; 95% CI, 0.47–3.97). Dobutamine infusion may produce severe vasodilation and result in lower MAP, and the inotropic response may be blunted in sepsis with a preserved chronotropic effect causing tachycardia without an increase in stroke volume. The panel considered the network meta-analysis as a higher quality than observational studies and issued a suggestion to use inotropes only in selected situations, and both should be discontinued in the absence of improvement in hypoperfusion or in the presence of adverse events.

### Guidelines for performance, interpretation, and application of stress echocardiography in ischemic heart disease: from the American Society of Echocardiography [^00acbbce]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2020). High credibility.

Dobutamine stress echocardiography (DSE) pharmacologic protocol — Dobutamine is usually delivered in graded doses starting at 5 μg/kg/ min and increasing at 3-minute intervals to 10, 20, 30 and 40 μg/kg/ min, and low dose dobutamine, with a beginning dose as low as 2.5 μg/kg/ min, may facilitate recognition of myocardial viability in abnormal segments. When target heart rate (HR) cannot be achieved with dobutamine alone, atropine can be added and is delivered in doses of 0.25 to 0.50 mg at 1 min intervals, as needed to achieve target heart rate, to a total of 1.0 to 2.0 mg, with the smaller dosage increment (0.25 mg) suggested in elderly patients, patients with small body habitus, and in those close to the target heart rate. The minimum dose should be used to avoid side effects, and a lower total dose (1.0 mg) is recommended in patients with prior neuropsychiatric symptoms or body mass index less than 24 kg/m². Atropine delivery at the 20 or 30 μg/kg/min dose of dobutamine, rather than the 40 μg/kg/min dose, facilitates achieving the target HR (85% of the age-predicted maximum HR) earlier. Endpoints for termination include achievement of the target HR, hypotension, new or worsening wall motion abnormalities, significant arrhythmias, severe hypertension, and intolerable symptoms. Withholding beta-blockers will facilitate achievement of target HR but may be accompanied by hypertension or arrhythmias, and elimination of the beta-blocker effect would require withholding these agents for 5 half-lives.

### Milrinone vs dobutamine for the management of cardiogenic shock: implications of renal function and injury [^e8cfcfe8]. JACC: Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Acute worsening of cardiac function resulting in AKI is commonly categorized as a type 1 cardiorenal syndrome. Although the mechanisms underlying renal injury in patients with cardiogenic shock are complex, and likely vary from patient to patient, hemodynamic-mediated renal injury secondary to inadequate renal perfusion is a common offender and a treatment target in the intensive care unit. Milrinone and dobutamine remain the most widely used pharmacotherapies to augment cardiac output in patients with cardiogenic shock. The selection of these agents remains largely operator and/or center dependent as there are no prospective trials suggesting the superiority of one agent compared to the other. However, renal dysfunction is a common clinical consideration when selecting vasoactive agents. In contrast to dobutamine, milrinone is primarily excreted in the urine and, as a result, its half-life and pharmacological effects can be prolonged in patients with renal dysfunction. In theory, increased plasma milrinone concentrations in patients with significant renal dysfunction could result in excess rates of arrhythmias and hypotension, although this has not been demonstrated in prospective trials.

The present analysis suggests a possible heterogeneity in the treatment effect of milrinone compared to dobutamine on clinical outcomes in relation to AKI. Compared to dobutamine, milrinone was associated with reduced rates of the primary outcome and death in the stratum of patients without AKI. These results should be interpreted with caution given that DOREMI was a negative trial. However, a plausible explanation requiring further investigation is that milrinone, compared to dobutamine, may offer therapeutic benefits which are attenuated in patients who develop AKI. Due to the high rates of AKI observed in DOREMI, this treatment effect would have been diluted in DOREMI resulting in comparable outcomes between treatment arms. Cardiogenic shock is a heterogeneous syndrome with variable etiologies and phenotypes requiring nuanced risk stratification and management. Exploring the role of individualized patient care, including patients with renal dysfunction, to improve clinical outcomes in cardiogenic shock remains a research priority.

10.3. Inotropic agents — In patients with evidence of low cardiac output and compromised systemic and end-organ perfusion, such as those with hypotension and cardiogenic shock, there is a Class I indication for the use of intravenous inotropic support; this is generally considered a short-term strategy, as failure to improve with inotropic support should result in consideration for mechanical support. The choice of inotropic agent will depend on the clinical presentation, with milrinone and/or dobutamine generally used as first-line agents in children, and if there is hypotension and ongoing poor end-organ perfusion, then epinephrine is often added. Dobutamine is a catecholaminergic agent acting primarily on the myocardial beta-1 receptors which has a quick onset of action, increases heart rate, stroke volume, and cardiac output, and also causes venous and arterial vasodilatation resulting in reduced pulmonary capillary wedge pressure; it causes an overall increase in myocardial oxygen consumption which limits its use to short-term rescue therapy and should be used with caution in patients who are on beta-blockers. Milrinone is a phosphodiesterase-3 inhibitor with both inotropic and vasodilator properties resulting in a decrease in both systemic and pulmonary vascular resistances, delivers more effective afterload reduction and improved coronary perfusion pressure compared to dobutamine with less effect on heart rate and myocardial oxygen demand, can be used for longer term management than dobutamine, and due to its clearance by the kidneys dosing needs to be adjusted in patients with renal impairment.

Drug Interactions

There was no evidence of drug interactions in clinical studies in which dobutamine was administered concurrently with other drugs, including digitalis preparations, furosemide, spironolactone, lidocaine, glyceryl trinitrate, isosorbide dinitrate, morphine, atropine, heparin, protamine, potassium chloride, folic acid, and acetaminophen. Preliminary studies indicate that the concomitant use of dobutamine and nitroprusside results in a higher cardiac output and, usually, a lower pulmonary wedge pressure than when either drug is used alone.

Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility

Studies to evaluate the carcinogenic or mutagenic potential of dobutamine or the potential of the drug to affect fertility adversely have not been performed.

Pregnancy

Reproduction studies performed in rats and rabbits have revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to dobutamine. The drug, however, has not been administered to pregnant women and should be used only when the expected benefits clearly outweigh the potential risks to the fetus.

Pediatric Use

Dobutamine has been shown to increase cardiac output and systemic pressure in pediatric patients of every age group. In premature neonates, however, dobutamine is less effective than dopamine in raising systemic blood pressure without causing undue tachycardia, and dobutamine has not been shown to provide any added benefit when given to such infants already receiving optimal infusions of dopamine.

Geriatric Use

Clinical studies of dobutamine injection did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or drug therapy.

PRECAUTIONS

General

During the administration of Dobutamine Hydrochloride in 5% Dextrose Injection, as with any adrenergic agent, ECG and blood pressure should be continuously monitored. In addition, pulmonary wedge pressure and cardiac output should be monitored whenever possible to aid in the safe and effective infusion of dobutamine.

Hypovolemia should be corrected with suitable volume expanders before treatment with dobutamine is instituted.

Animal studies indicate that dobutamine may be ineffective if the patient has recently received a beta-blocking drug. In such a case, the peripheral vascular resistance may increase.

No improvement may be observed in the presence of marked mechanical obstruction, such as severe valvular aortic stenosis.

Solutions containing dextrose should be used with caution in patients with known subclinical or overt diabetes mellitus.

Do not administer unless solution is clear and seal is intact.

If administration is controlled by a pumping device, care must be taken to discontinue pumping action before the container runs dry or air embolism may result.

Usage Following Acute Myocardial Infarction

Clinical experience with dobutamine following myocardial infarction has been insufficient to establish the safety of the drug for this use. There is concern that any agent that increases contractile force and heart rate may increase the size of an infarction by intensifying ischemia, but it is not known whether dobutamine does so.

### Current diagnostic and treatment strategies for specific dilated cardiomyopathies: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^92ffc170]. Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Stress-induced cardiomyopathy — treatment — relies on supportive care focused on managing heart failure (HF) symptoms and treating hypotension and cardiogenic shock with appropriate therapies, while the role of neurohormonal agents is as yet unknown. A catecholamine-mediated process could have implications for management, with agents such as dobutamine theoretically able to worsen stress-induced cardiomyopathy, although this has not been reported or studied clinically; β-blockers can cause stimulus trafficking of β2-adrenergic receptors to Gi protein coupling resulting in negative inotropy. Intra-aortic balloon pump and calcium-sensitizing agents have been suggested as first- and second-line therapies, but the infrequency of this condition and reliance on small series have limited the capacity to develop standardized treatment strategies.

### Dopamine versus dobutamine for hypotensive preterm infants [^d688c586]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Inotropes are widely used in preterm infants to treat systemic hypotension. The most commonly used drugs are dopamine and dobutamine. These agents have different modes of action which may result in different haemodynamic effects.

Objectives

To compare the effectiveness and safety of dopamine and dobutamine in the treatment of systemic hypotension in preterm infants.

Search Strategy

Searches of electronic and other databases were performed including MEDLINE (1966–2002), EMBASE (1988–2002), Science Citation Index (1981–2002), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 2, 2003). Previous reviews were searched for references to relevant trials and leading authors in the field were contacted for information about other published and unpublished studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials where short and/or long term effects of treatment with dopamine and dobutamine for the treatment of systemic arterial hypotension were compared were selected for this review. Trials studying newborn infants born before 37 completed weeks gestation and less than 28 days of age were eligible for inclusion. Systemic arterial hypotension was not defined specifically, but accepted as defined in individual studies. Studies were not limited by birthweight, lower gestational age threshold or by route or duration of administration of inotropic agents. Study quality and eligibility were assessed independently by each reviewer.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data extraction was performed independently by each reviewer, with differences being resolved by discussion. The following outcomes were determined: mortality in the neonatal period, long term neurodevelopmental outcome, radiological evidence of severe neurological injury, short term haemodynamic changes and incidence of adverse effects. The effect of interventions was expressed either as Relative Risk (RR), Risk Difference (RD) or as Weighted Mean Difference (WMD) with their 95% Confidence Interval (CI).

Main Results

Five trials met the pre-defined criteria for inclusion in this review. There was no evidence of a significant difference between dopamine and dobutamine in terms of neonatal mortality (RD 0.02 95% CI -0.12 to 0.16), incidence of periventricular leukomalacia (RD -0.08, 95% CI -0.19 to 0.04), or severe periventricular haemorrhage (RD -0.02, 95% CI -0.13 to 0.09). Dopamine was more successful than dobutamine in treating systemic hypotension, with fewer infants having treatment failure (RD -0.23, 95% CI -0.34 to -0.13; NNT = 4.4, 95% CI 2.9 to 7.7). Treatment with dobutamine was associated with a significantly greater increase in left ventricular output in the single study reporting that outcome. There was no evidence of a significant difference between the two agents with respect to the incidence of tachycardia (RD -0.06, 95% CI -0.25 to 0.14). None of the studies reported the incidence of adverse long term neurodevelopmental outcome.

Reviewer's Conclusions

Dopamine is more effective than dobutamine in the short term treatment of systemic hypotension in preterm infants. There was no evidence of an effect on the incidence of adverse neuroradiological sequelae (severe periventricular haemorrhage and/or periventricular leucomalacia), or on the incidence of tachycardia. However, in the absence of data confirming long term benefit and safety of dopamine compared to dobutamine, no firm recommendations can be made regarding the choice of drug to treat hypotension.

Introduction: Treatment decisions on patients with shock lack consensus. In an international survey we aimed to evaluate the indications, current practice, and therapeutic goals on the use of inotropes in the treatment of shock states.

Methods: From November 2016 to February 2017 an anonymous 27-question web-based survey was accessible to members of the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine (ESICM). A total of 27 questions focused on the profile of respondents, and the triggering factors, first line choice, dosing, timing, targets, additional treatment strategy, and suggested effect of cardiovascular drugs.

Results: A total of 827 physicians responded. As detailed in Table 1, the respondents think that dobutamine is first-line inotrope to increase cardiac pump function (N = 695, 84%) and should be started when signs of hypoperfusion or hyperlactatemia despite adequate use of fluids and vasopressors in the context of low left ventricular ejection fraction are present (N = 359, 43%). The most accepted target was an adequate cardiac output (N = 369, 45%). The combination of noradrenaline and dobutamine was preferred to single treatment with adrenaline mainly due to possibility to titrate individually (N = 366, 44%). The main reason for adding another inotrope was to use synergistic effects of two different mechanisms of action (N = 229, 27%). According to respondents, phosphodiesterase-inhibitors should be used in the treatment of predominant right heart failure because of prominent vasodilatory effect on the pulmonary circulation (N = 360, 44%). They also believe levosimendan is the only inotrope that does not increase myocardial oxygen demand (N = 350, 42%). Vasodilators are used in cardiogenic shock to decrease left ventricular afterload (N = 244, 30%). There is no experience or no opinion about the use of ß-blockers in shock states (N = 268, 32%).

Conclusions: This web-based survey provided latest trends on inotrope use in shock states which showed considerable diversity among respondents in opinions about its use.

### Impact of baseline β-blocker use on inotrope response and clinical outcomes in cardiogenic shock: a subgroup analysis of the DOREMI trial [^3f36dd83]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

In the DOREMI trial, patients with CS were randomly assigned to receive dobutamine or milrinone, the two approved inotropic agents in North America. Milrinone is a phosphodiesterase-III inhibitor and dobutamine is a synthetic catecholamine with beta-1 and beta-2 receptor agonism. In patients with acute decompensated heart failure, the inotropic effects of dobutamine have been shown to be dependent on the degree of occupancy of the beta-receptor and on the activity of the beta-adrenergic signal transduction mechanisms. 11,15 As a result, the use of a phosphodiesterase-III inhibitor has been suggested in lieu of beta-agonists for patients who had been treated with BBs. 16 Our study is the first to evaluate the impact of baseline BB on clinical and hemodynamic parameters and contrary to traditional teaching, we found little difference. While vasoactive-inotrope score was mildly greater among BB patients treated with dobutamine compared to milrinone, there was no difference in heart rate, mean arterial pressure or clinical outcomes. Moreover, there was no difference between BB and non-BB vasoactive-inotrope scores in those randomized to dobutamine. Contrasting with patients with decompensated heart failure, in the shock state with hypotension there is increased sympathetic tone and catecholamine levels in a compensatory response to maintain cardiac output, 17 which may mitigate the BB effect. Accordingly, selection of inotropic agent could reasonably be based on physician comfort and hemodynamic goals of the patient irrespective of baseline BB use.

### Randomized clinical trials with levosimendan [^954dc5ca]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

There are important unmet needs in the treatment of acute heart failure syndromes (AHFS). The unique dual mechanism of action of levosimendan suggests that this new agent may help fill some of these unmet needs. A review of randomized, controlled clinical trials with levosimendan demonstrated that it is well tolerated, and its use results in significantly reduced pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) and increased cardiac output. Effects of levosimendan on PCWP and cardiac output are more pronounced than those observed with dobutamine. Levosimendan treatment is also associated with significantly improved clinical symptoms. Moreover, data from 3 trials indicate that levosimendan treatment was associated with improved 6-month survival compared with dobutamine treatment or placebo. Emerging data suggest that levosimendan is beneficial for patients with acute myocardial ischemia. Thus, early clinical indicators suggest that levosimendan may help prevent myocardial injury during hospitalization for AHFS and may be well suited for first-line therapy for AHFS.

Dobutamine — indications, tapering, and adverse effects: Dobutamine is recommended for patients with low cardiac output and substantially reduced blood pressure provided they are not receiving concomitant β-blocker therapy, as concomitant β-blockers with dobutamine may attenuate the benefit of either agent; prolonged infusion over 96 hours has been associated with a decrease in hemodynamic effect by as much as 50%, it is mandatory to taper off dobutamine rather than abruptly discontinue, and treatment significantly increases serious ventricular arrhythmias, though this may be less pronounced in normal sinus rhythm.

### Optimal dosing of dobutamine for treating post-resuscitation left ventricular dysfunction [^a1ebbd66]. Resuscitation (2004). Low credibility.

Objectives

This study was designed to determine the optimal dose of dobutamine in the treatment of post-resuscitation left ventricular dysfunction.

Background

Global left ventricular dysfunction following successful resuscitation from prolonged, ventricular fibrillation cardiac arrest, negatively impacts long-term survival. Dobutamine can overcome this global myocardial stunning. Previous data indicate a dose of 10 mcg/kgmin improves systolic and diastolic function, but markedly increases the heart rate.

Methods

Twenty swine (24 ± 0.4 kg) were randomized to one of four doses (0, 2, 5, and 7.5 mcg/kgmin) of dobutamine for the treatment of post-resuscitation myocardial dysfunction following 12.5 min of untreated ventricular fibrillation cardiac arrest. Cardiac function was measured at pre-arrest baseline and serially for 6 h post-resuscitation. Left ventricular function was evaluated by contrast ventriculograms, left ventricular pressures, +dP/dt, Tau, -dP/dt, and cardiac output. Myocardial oxygen consumption and myocardial blood flow were measured to assess the functional significance of any dobutamine-mediated heart rate responses.

Results

Left ventricular dysfunction was evident at 25 min and peaked 4 h post-resuscitation. Significant (P < 0.05) improvements in ventricular systolic (EF, CO) and diastolic (LVEDP, Tau) function were evident within minutes of dobutamine initiation and persisted at 6h for the 5 and 7.5 mcg/kgmin groups. Tachycardia manifested with all dobutamine doses, but only affected myocardial oxygen consumption significantly (P < 0.05) at the highest dose (7.5 mcg/kgmin).

Conclusions

Dobutamine at 5 mcg/kgmin appears optimal for restoring systolic and diastolic function post-resuscitation without adversely affecting myocardial oxygen consumption.

Table 2
Summary of the effects of commonly used vasoactive drugs on intensive care at the cellular level

Dobutamine is recommended for treatment of moderate hypotension (70–100 mm Hg systolic) following myocardial infarction, without clinical features of shock. In CS of any aetiology, the use of dobutamine or milrinone should be considered early. Vasodilatory effects, necessitating coadministration with a vasopressor, often limit their use. Norepinephrine should be regarded as the first-line vasopressor (table 3); it is non-inferior to dopamine, and dopamine has demonstrated worse outcomes in the CS subgroup with the attendant risks of arrhythmias. Vasopressin is increasingly deployed as a norepinephrine sparing vasopressor and in the context of right heart failure owing to its pulmonary vasodilatory properties. Epinephrine should be restricted to patients with persistent hypotension despite adequate cardiac filling pressures as it has not been shown to be superior to alternatives and its use has been associated with lactic acidosis, tachyarrhythmias and gastric malperfusion.

Table 3
Vasoactive management of cardiogenic shock profiles

Assessment of clinical response to all interventions should occur serially through a combination of clinical assessment, biochemical (lactate, central venous oxygen saturations) and haemodynamic variables (echocardiography, CO, cardiac index and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure). Continuous haemodynamic monitoring is essential to allow early identification of changes in clinical condition and titration of both pharmacological therapies and MCS, which are often used in tandem. Central venous cannulation permits the safe administration of vasoactive drugs and allows monitoring of right atrial pressures and central venous gases, a surrogate assessment of tissue oxygen delivery and utilisation.

Consensus on the optimal method of haemodynamic monitoring in CS is lacking, although invasive monitoring with an arterial line in addition to continuous ECG should be considered at a minimum. A range of CO devices exist using either thermodilution or bolus indicator dilution. None has demonstrated superiority or outcome benefit; nonetheless, pulmonary artery catheterisation is advocated in the management of CS to aid diagnosis and monitor response to interventions. Use of any CO monitoring should be determined by local availability, safety profile and clinical context of the patient. Where a commensurate physiological response is not being achieved despite escalating pharmacotherapy, discussion with a centre with MCS capability should be considered.

Stress testing modalities (Table 2) — exercise (bicycle/treadmill), dobutamine, and dipyridamole/adenosine — are contrasted by physiology, test selection, hemodynamics, and contraindications. Exercise preserves integrity of the electro-mechanical response and is the preferred stress for patients who can attain an adequate level of exercise for known or suspected CAD, with systolic blood pressure ↑↑ by 50%. Dobutamine stimulates beta-1 adrenoceptors with the effect of increased heart rate and/or contractility; contraindications include hemodynamically significant LV outflow tract obstruction and severe systemic hypertension (resting systolic blood pressure > 180 mmHg). Vasodilators increase coronary blood flow through effects on adenosine A2A receptors, and myocardial blood flow may be ↑ 3 to 5 times that of resting blood flow; they are the preferred test for myocardial perfusion, with contraindications including pronounced active bronchospastic airway disease.

Treatment Cardiogenic Shock With Preserved Blood Pressure and Low Cardiac Output State

To date there are no randomized studies comparing the safety and efficacy of inotropes with inodilators in CS. There are 3 commonly administered inodilators in clinical practice, each with a unique mechanism of action; β1‐ and β2‐AR agonist, dobutamine; PDE3 inhibitors such as milrinone; and the calcium sensitizer, levosimendan (not routinely available in the United States). Although these agents increase myocardial contractility and lusitropy like traditional inotropes, they also have the effect of reducing cardiac afterload through vasodilation. The use of milrinone and dobutamine has recently been compared through the CAPITAL DOREMI (Milrinone as Compared with Dobutamine in the Treatment of Cardiogenic Shock) study, a single‐center, double‐blinded randomized controlled trial. This study included 192 patients (96 participants in each treatment arm) admitted to ICU with CS and randomized to receive either milrinone or dobutamine. There was no difference in the primary composite outcome of in‐hospital mortality, resuscitated cardiac arrest, cardiac transplantation or mechanical circulatory support, nonfatal myocardial infarction, stroke, or renal replacement therapy (relative risk [RR], 0.9 [95% CI, 0.69–1.19]). In a prespecified subgroup analysis, which included 65 patients with AMI‐CS, there was also no significant difference in the primary composite outcome between agents (hazard ratio [HR], 1.35 [95% CI, 0.73–2.47]). However, the findings from this study should be interpreted with a degree of caution due to its small sample size potentially rendering the trial underpowered to detect the smaller than anticipated treatment effects in both the primary composite and secondary outcomes. Furthermore, its generalizability to other clinical settings may be limited as it was a single‐center study conducted in a quaternary level ICU. Nevertheless, considering these findings, patients who are normotensive and in a low cardiac output state, it is reasonable to consider the administration of either dobutamine or milrinone as a first‐line therapy, with the exception of severe renal impairment where dobutamine should be used in preference to milrinone.

Inotropes

Dobutamine (predominantly β 2 -adrenergic, Table 4) has both inotropic and mild vasodilatory effects. In an open-label setting addition of dobutamine in septic patients was associated with improved OPS-measured sublingual microcirculatory perfusion over time, irrespective of changes in systemic hemodynamic variables. Interestingly, topical application of acetylcholine further improved microcirculatory perfusion, challenging the widespread concept of an irresponsive endothelium in sepsis-induced hypotension. In a crossover setting, dobutamine attenuated intramucosal acidosis during sepsis, whereas dopamine did not change pCO₂ g-a under equal effects in systemic hemodynamics. Addition of dobutamine to NE in septic patients revealed a lower pCO₂ g-a, but no change in ICG plasma clearance; this could either be due to a direct effect on the microcirculation or a result of an increase in cardiac output. Whether an increase in general splanchnic perfusion indeed is followed by improved organ function is still a matter of debate.

Dopamine (β 2 -adrenergic and dopaminergic, Table 4; in high-dose also α-adrenergic, Table 2) was used in sepsis for many years in low concentrations for its potential beneficial effects on renal function as a result of afferent renal vessel dilatation. However, results of multiple studies have made such an effect of clinical relevance very unlikely. Low-dose dopamine in addition to NE did not alter pHᵢ despite increased overall splanchnic oxygen consumption. High-dose dopamine decreased pHᵢ despite a rise in cardiac output, whereas NE increased pHᵢ at the same MAP.

Potential detrimental effects of classical inotropic drugs

The "classical" inotropic drugs (catecholamines and phosphodiesterase III inhibitors) are widely used in the perioperative setting, particularly in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. While they can provide life-sustaining support in circumstances of severe right and/or left cardiac ventricular failure and improve both clinical symptoms experienced by patients and systemic end-organ perfusion, the benefits of these inotropes on medium- and long-term survival have never been documented. To date, none of the available drugs satisfies all criteria of an ideal inotropic agent (Table 1), and there is no current evidence to recommend the choice of any of them over the others for the daily practice.

Table 1
Theoretical clinical characteristics of an ideal positive inotropic agent (from)

The catecholamines (especially dobutamine) are the most frequently used during the perioperative period. With an elimination half-life of just a few minutes, their on/off properties are quite appreciated at the bedside. The infusion of dobutamine produces a dose-dependent rise in cardiac output, mainly by increasing heart rate rather than stroke volume. Major adverse cardiac events (ventricular arrhythmias and myocardial infarction), stroke, renal replacement therapy, and all-cause mortality (short- and long-term) increase when these agents are used during the perioperative period. Similarly, the use of catecholamines or phosphodiesterase III inhibitors in patients with acute heart failure is associated with an increase in mortality in the medical setting. The worsening in myocardial energy imbalance likely participates to the detrimental effects of the classical inotropic drugs, especially in situations of myocardial reperfusion injury. However, many physicians still do not perceive the risk of complications associated with these drugs and keep using them routinely, sometimes despite a lack of evidence for their usefulness. It should also be clearly noted that levosimendan has not demonstrated a clear superiority to other inotropes in well-designed trials.

How the intervention might work

Therapeutic strategies to optimise cardiac output and minimise oxygen demand are not restricted to drugs acting on the heart itself or to drugs as such. It is important to optimise mechanical ventilation and oxygen supply (Liu 2023), volume load for the right and the left ventricles (Oh 2019), and body temperature, and, equally important, to prevent dysrhythmia (Zhang 1991). In addition to all these measures, pharmacological treatment may be needed to increase myocardial contractility (inotropic medications), to decrease afterload (vasodilators without inotropic effect), or a combination of these mechanisms (inodilators).

Catecholamines such as dobutamine, dopamine, epinephrine, and norepinephrine act on dopamine receptors or on alpha or beta (or both) adrenoceptors. These are located in the myocardium and in blood vessels. Some of the substances are synthesised by the body physiologically; for example, as stress hormones. The combination of its alpha and beta activity, which may vary based on drug dosing, determines the net effect of a given substance (Jentzer 2015). In the myocardium, catecholamines have positive inotropic, chronotropic, and dromotropic effects and increase myocardial oxygen consumption. In the vasculature, they can have vasopressor or vasodilatory effects (Prichard 1991).

### Dobutamine inhibits phorbol-myristate-acetate-induced activation of nuclear factor-kappaB in human T lymphocytes in vitro [^f34daa0a]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2004). Low credibility.

Adrenergic drugs are often used for hemodynamic support of cardiac output and vasomotor tone in critically ill patients. Recent evidence shows that the administration of these vasoactive drugs may affect cytokine release and could influence the inflammatory response. However, the mechanism of this immunomodulatory effect remains unknown. The nuclear transcription factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) regulates the expression of many cytokines and plays a central role in the immune response. Therefore, we examined the effects of various adrenergic drugs (dobutamine, xamoterol, clenbuterol, epinephrine, norepinephrine, and phenylephrine) on the activation of NF-kappaB, on the NF-kappaB-driven reporter gene activity, and on the expression of the NF-kappaB target gene interleukin (IL)-8. In addition, we quantified the amount of the NF-kappaB inhibitors IkappaBalpha and IL-10. Here we report that dobutamine inhibited the activation of NF-kappaB in primary human CD3(+) T lymphocytes. Suppression of NF-kappaB involved the stabilization of its inhibitor, IkappaBalpha. The effect appears to be beta(2)-receptor specific, because beta(1)-adrenergic and alpha-adrenergic substances (i.e., xamoterol, epinephrine, norepinephrine, and phenylephrine) did not affect NF-kappaB activation and because dobutamine-mediated inhibition of NF-kappaB could be prevented by a specific beta(2)-antagonist. Our results demonstrate that dobutamine is a potent and specific inhibitor of NF-kappaB, and they thus provide a possible molecular mechanism for the immunomodulation associated with beta-adrenergic therapy.

### Levosimendan treatment for heart failure: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^c4cc7490]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

Emerging studies suggest that administration of levosimendan therapy may be better than dobutamine or placebo in decompensated heart failure. The authors performed an updated meta-analysis of trials to obtain the best estimates of the efficacy and safety of levosimendan for the initial treatment of decompensated heart failure.

Design

A meta-analysis.

Setting

Hospitals.

Participants

A total of 5,349 patients from 25 randomized controlled studies were included in the analysis.

Interventions

None.

Measurements and Main Results

The authors performed a meta-analysis of trials comparing levosimendan therapy with dobutamine or placebo in patients with decompensated heart failure. Twenty-five trials, involving 5,349 patients, were included. Two reviewers performed independent article review and study quality assessment. Data on overall mortality, early-term mortality, midterm mortality, long-term mortality, efficacy outcomes, and adverse events were collected. Mortality outcomes were according to follow-up duration: early term (≤ 30-day), midterm (30-day to ≤ 6-month), and long term (> 6-month). Levosimendan was compared with dobutamine or placebo, calculating pooled relatives risk (RRs) and associated 95% confidence intervals (CIs). A random-effects model was selected for meta-analysis if there was significant heterogeneity. Levosimendan significantly reduced total mortality (17.1% versus 20.8%; RR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.75–0.94). Compared with dobutamine, levosimendan was associated with significant reduction in mortality at final follow-up (RR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.76–0.97; I² = 7%; p = 0.02). Compared with placebo, levosimendan was associated with a nonsignificant trend in favor of placebo in mortality at final follow-up (11.6% versus 16.2%, RR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.56–1.01; p = 0.06), but it was associated with a significant reduction in long-term mortality (RR, 0.34; 95%CI, 0.15–0.76; p = 0.009). Compared with dobutamine or placebo, levosimendan therapy was associated with improvements in hemodynamically- and echocardiographically-derived cardiac parameters. Levosimendan therapy increased the risks of extrasystoles (RR, 1.88; 95% CI, 1.26–2.81), hypotension (RR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.15–1.53), and headache or migraine (RR, 1.94; 95% CI, 1.54–2.43) when compared with control therapy.

Conclusions

As compared to placebo or dobutamine, levosimendan in patients with heart failure seemed to have hemodynamic and cardiac benefits. It reduced total mortality and was associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular adverse events.

### Prospective, randomized trial comparing fluids and dobutamine optimization of oxygen delivery in high-risk surgical patients [^fd56fed0]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

Introduction

Mortality is unacceptably high in certain groups of surgical patients. Advanced age, extensive surgical trauma, cancer, blood transfusions, and poor nutritional state are conditions reported to be associated with severe changes of the body's defense mechanisms, making the patient highly susceptible to morbidity and mortality. Sepsis and multiple organ failure remains the most common cause of death.

Some authors have shown that the optimization of the oxygen delivery index (DO₂I > 600 ml/minute/m²), guided by a pulmonary artery catheter, in the perioperative period of high-risk patients determined better survival and less episodes of complications when initiated before the development of organ failure and when therapy produced differences in oxygen delivery. The term 'optimization' refers to therapeutic intervention mainly with fluids, inotropic drugs and red blood cells, aiming at a better cardiovascular function anticipating the increase in oxygen demand during surgery. The main objective is to maintain tissue perfusion to minimize the hepatosplanchnic ischemia, thus assuring organic function.

High-risk surgical patients often present a decreased intravascular volume prior to a surgical procedure due to various factors. The importance of fluid replacement in the perioperative period cannot be underestimated. Anesthetic induction still results in increases in systemic vascular capacitance and, to a certain extent, in myocardial depression. Patients with chronic heart failure can face a series of events during prolonged surgery that may end in acute decompensation. Even critically ill patients without preexisting myocardial contractile dysfunction may sustain severe perioperative complications with subsequent acute heart failure.

In previous randomized controlled trials in high-risk surgical patients, after the adequate recovery of volemia, either dobutamine or dopexamine have been used with the objective to optimize the cardiac index and/or the oxygen delivery. Older patients with existing cardiorespiratory illness undergoing major surgery have a reduced morbidity and mortality when dobutamine is used to maximize oxygen transport. Nevertheless, in certain groups of surgical patients, goal-directed therapy using fluids alone improved the outcome. Evidence that optimization of fluid therapy, in the absence of inotropes, reduces mortality in high-risk patients is not available. The primary outcome measure of the present study was to evaluate the effect of both DO 2 I optimization with fluids or with fluids and dobutamine on the 60-day mortality in high-risk general surgery patients. The second outcome measure was the incidence of complications, particularly cardiovascular adverse events.

Cardiogenic shock — use of vasoactive medications — states that hypoperfusion can be addressed by starting intravenous vasoactive medications, including inotropes, chronotropes, inopressors, inodilators, vasodilators, and vasopressors; although commonly used, these drugs have been associated with increased adverse effects, including arrhythmias, and increased myocardial oxygen consumption, so the writing committee advises that vasoactive medications be used in CS at the lowest possible dose to support adequate perfusion and for the shortest possible duration; evidence comparisons report that a Cochrane analysis found insufficient evidence to support the superiority of a particular inotrope or vasodilating agent in CS, and the Dobutamine Compared with Milrinone (DOREMI) trial evaluating dobutamine vs milrinone in CS patients ranging from SCAI B through E found no difference with respect to the primary composite endpoint of in-hospital death from any cause, resuscitated cardiac arrest, receipt of a cardiac transplant or mechanical circulatory support.

Limitations

Because of slow recruitment, the study was terminated before the prespecified number of patients had been included, which weakened the scientific conclusions of the study. The two study drugs, levosimendan and dobutamine have different pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles, resulting in a different duration of effect. This was compensated for by administering the two drugs for different lengths of time, but it is possible that the duration of effect may still have been different.

### Intraoperative milrinone versus dobutamine in cardiac surgery patients: a retrospective cohort study on mortality [^4ae8b29f]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

This retrospective study found intraoperative milrinone treatment to be associated with an increased mortality compared with dobutamine treatment in cardiac surgery patients. The main analysis was supplemented with a number of sensitivity analyses all confirming a tendency toward increased mortality among milrinone receivers. A few observational studies have reported increased mortality associated with overall inotrope use in the cardiac surgery setting. However, inconsistent data support the superiority of one inotropic therapy over the other. Accordingly, choice of inotropes in the treatment of cardiac failure both in a post-bypass situation and in nonsurgical heart failure seem to be largely guided by experts' opinion along with institutional and provider preference. In Denmark, use of milrinone for cardiac failure following cardiopulmonary bypass has increased at the expense of dobutamine use. Milrinone was introduced as an agent which, compared to dobutamine, cause reduced left and right heart filling pressures due to its greater reduction in vascular resistance, and thus superior to dobutamine in treatment of low cardiac output syndrome following cardiac surgery. However, in reviewing the literature, we found only two randomized trials comparing the isolated action of milrinone versus dobutamine in cardiac surgery. The notion that milrinone is superior to dobutamine seems to be based on one randomized trial including 120 patients randomized to either bolus and infusion milrinone or infusion dobutamine (60 patients in each treatment arm) if meeting an entry criterion of a cardiac index < 2.0 L/min/m² within 2 h after separation from cardiopulmonary bypass. Both drugs were found equally effective to reverse low cardiac output after cardiac surgery, and in subgroup analysis were equally effective at treating pulmonary hypertension. More adverse events were noted in the dobutamine arm with a higher incidence of hypertension and atrial fibrillation, whereas milrinone was associated with a higher incidence of bradycardia. The study was not powered to estimate effect on mortality and no long-term postoperative outcomes were reported. The only other study, a small randomized study among 20 patients undergoing cardiac surgery, however, found no marked differences in hemodynamic parameters according to treatment with dobutamine or milrinone. The study provided no information on clinical outcomes. Earlier trials comparing the efficacy of early-generation phosphodiesterase inhibitors (maranon and enoximone) with dobutamine similarly lack data on effect on major clinical outcomes. Recent meta-analyses of randomized clinical trials with milrinone for cardiac dysfunction conclude that the use of milrinone is neither to be recommended nor refuted due to risk of bias and random error in current evidence. None of the included studies in these meta-analyses used dobutamine as a single comparator. One study using network meta-analytic data including indirect comparisons suggested no big differences between milrinone and dobutamine in cardiac surgery. To date, the only randomized trial sufficiently powered to establish the safety and efficacy profile of milrinone was the OPTIME-CHF trial enrolling 951 patients with nonsurgical acute exacerbation of chronic heart failure. The results of this trial suggested that milrinone might be harmful in patients with ischemic heart failure with LVEF < 40%. However, data are difficult to interpret as the study allowed cointerventions with dobutamine in randomized patients.

### Levosimendan vs dobutamine for patients with acute decompensated heart failure: the SURVIVE randomized trial [^10d5b4a7]. JAMA (2007). Excellent credibility.

Context

Because acute decompensated heart failure causes substantial morbidity and mortality, there is a need for agents that at least improve hemodynamics and relieve symptoms without adversely affecting survival.

Objective

To assess the effect of a short-term intravenous infusion of levosimendan or dobutamine on long-term survival.

Design, Setting, and Patients

The Survival of Patients With Acute Heart Failure in Need of Intravenous Inotropic Support (SURVIVE) study was a randomized, double-blind trial comparing the efficacy and safety of intravenous levosimendan or dobutamine in 1327 patients hospitalized with acute decompensated heart failure who required inotropic support. The trial was conducted at 75 centers in 9 countries and patients were randomized between March 2003 and December 2004.

Interventions

Intravenous levosimendan (n = 664) or intravenous dobutamine (n = 663).

Main Outcome Measure

All-cause mortality at 180 days.

Results

All-cause mortality at 180 days occurred in 173 (26%) patients in the levosimendan group and 185 (28%) patients in the dobutamine group (hazard ratio, 0.91; 95% confidence interval, 0.74–1.13; P = 0.40). The levosimendan group had greater decreases in B-type natriuretic peptide level at 24 hours that persisted through 5 days compared with the dobutamine group (P < .001 for all time points). There were no statistical differences between treatment groups for the other secondary end points (all-cause mortality at 31 days, number of days alive and out of the hospital, patient global assessment, patient assessment of dyspnea at 24 hours, and cardiovascular mortality at 180 days). There was a higher incidence of cardiac failure in the dobutamine group. There were higher incidences of atrial fibrillation, hypokalemia, and headache in the levosimendan group.

Conclusion

Despite an initial reduction in plasma B-type natriuretic peptide level in patients in the levosimendan group compared with patients in the dobutamine group, levosimendan did not significantly reduce all-cause mortality at 180 days or affect any secondary clinical outcomes.

### The clinical use of stress echocardiography in non-ischaemic heart disease: recommendations from the European association of cardiovascular imaging and the American Society of Echocardiography [^e4e6e223]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2017). Medium credibility.

Dobutamine stress echocardiography — staged dosing and precautions are specified: for detection of inotropic response in HF patients, stages of 5 min are used, starting from 5 up to 20 μg/kg/min, and to fully recruit the inotropic reserve in patients with HF and under β-blocker therapy, doses up to 40 μg/kg/min may be required; in assessment of the patient with possible severe aortic valve stenosis, the maximal dose is usually 20 μg/kg/min, as higher doses are less safe and probably unnecessary; atropine coadministration is associated with higher rate of complications in those with a history of neuropsychiatric symptoms, reduced LV function, or small body habitus; the dobutamine infusion is started as usual at 5 μg/kg/min and titrated upward in steps of 2.5–5 μg/kg/min every 5–8 min, with a period of 2–3 min after each increment before image acquisition to allow the haemodynamic response to develop.

### Dobutamine reverses the vasopressin-associated impairment in cardiac index and systemic oxygen supply in ovine endotoxemia [^6df8a553]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

Key messages

- AVP impairs the CI and the systemic oxygen supply when used in a moderate dose (0.04 U min -1) in ovine endotoxemia.

- In fluid-challenged endotoxemic sheep, dobutamine reverses the AVP-associated impairment in CI, DO₂I and SᵥO₂, and further increases MAP.

- The dobutamine-associated effects are dose-dependent and strongest at an infusion rate of 10 μg kg -1 min -1.

Potential non-routine (niche) indications for levosimendan (Fig. 1)

Levosimendan for heart failure patients receiving beta-blockers

Patients receiving beta-blockers (BB) in an acute or chronic setting have an altered beta-adrenergic receptor function and are therefore unlikely to respond optimally to catecholamines. The relevant clinical contexts are as follows: (i) patients with acute myocardial infarction given BB prophylactically who subsequently develop cardiogenic shock and require inotropic support, (ii) patients with chronic heart failure who are under chronic BB therapy and have acute on chronic cardiac decompensation, and (iii) patients with accidental/intentional BB intoxication. When beta-adrenergic receptors number and/or function are decreased, levosimendan appears as the drug of choice because its mechanisms of action are independent of this receptor. This is supported by a few experimental and clinical studies. In an animal model of acute intoxication with propranolol, Leppikangas et al. demonstrated that levosimendan, but not dobutamine or placebo, was able to increase stroke volume, inotropism, heart rate, and mean arterial pressure. This was associated with a 100% survival of animals with levosimendan, as compared to 20% with dobutamine or placebo. In a small number (n = 52) of patients with acute or chronic heart failure and treated with beta-blockers, a prospective randomized double-blind international study found that levosimendan, as opposed to dobutamine, increased cardiac index and decreased pulmonary capillary wedged pressure, but failed to improve clinical symptoms and mixed venous oxygen saturation. In addition, exploratory findings in favor of levosimendan were also reported from subgroup analyses of the LIDO and SURVIVE studies, comparing patients receiving beta-blockers versus those not receiving these drugs. Based on these possible beneficial hemodynamic effects, levosimendan is now considered the first-choice drug in patients with acute decompensated heart failure and on beta-blockers, if beta-blockade is thought to be contributing to hypotension with subsequent hypoperfusion (class IIb, evidence level C).

### Guidelines for performance, interpretation, and application of stress echocardiography in ischemic heart disease: from the American Society of Echocardiography [^916e2016]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2020). High credibility.

Assessment of contractile reserve for viability — information on viability provided by the resting echocardiogram is often insufficient for clinical decision making, so stress echocardiographic methods that utilize agents to stimulate contraction in dysfunctional but viable myocardium provide more accurate information on the potential for functional recovery. The most widely used method assesses functional responses to dobutamine stimulation, and at low doses the potent inotropic effect of dobutamine can stimulate contraction without a substantial increase in heart rate and oxygen consumption. Dobutamine is the preferred agent for viability assessment, although other agents can be utilized depending on the clinical setting, and excessive increases in myocardial oxygen demand or significant declines in aortic diastolic pressure and coronary driving pressure should be avoided.

### Coronary artery spasm following dobutamine stress echocardiogram [^e8632171]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

A 53-year-old woman with atypical chest pain underwent a dobutamine stress echocardiogram (DSE) and developed a coronary spasm (CS) with severe pain and dramatic ST-segment elevation 9min after dobutamine infusion was discontinued. The spasm resolved after sublingual nitroglycerin administration. The same-day coronary angiogram showed non-significant stenosis in the three coronary territories. Retrospectively, we found that the patient had vasospastic angina (VSA), a condition that has been strongly associated with the development of dobutamine-induced CS. Mechanisms of dobutamine-induced CS are not fully understood and include endothelial dysfunction leading to deficient nitric oxide-mediated coronary vasodilation in response to increased myocardial oxygen demand as well as imbalance between β1 and β2 adrenergic effects of dobutamine. Dobutamine-induced CS has also been much more frequently reported in patients from Asian descent with VSA. VSA should be systemically recognised in patients considered for DSE and, if present, other modalities of stress imaging should be discussed.

### A global perspective on vasoactive agents in shock [^1dd0f325]. Intensive Care Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

We set out to summarize the current knowledge on vasoactive drugs and their use in the management of shock to inform physicians' practices.

Methods

This is a narrative review by a multidisciplinary, multinational-from six continents-panel of experts including physicians, a pharmacist, trialists, and scientists.

Results and Conclusions

Vasoactive drugs are an essential part of shock management. Catecholamines are the most commonly used vasoactive agents in the intensive care unit, and among them norepinephrine is the first-line therapy in most clinical conditions. Inotropes are indicated when myocardial function is depressed and dobutamine remains the first-line therapy. Vasoactive drugs have a narrow therapeutic spectrum and expose the patients to potentially lethal complications. Thus, these agents require precise therapeutic targets, close monitoring with titration to the minimal efficacious dose and should be weaned as promptly as possible. Moreover, the use of vasoactive drugs in shock requires an individualized approach. Vasopressin and possibly angiotensin II may be useful owing to their norepinephrine-sparing effects.

### Different responses to dobutamine in the presence of carvedilol or metoprolol in patients with chronic heart failure [^9b8b019d]. Heart (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine whether patients with congestive heart failure on different beta adrenoreceptor blocking drugs have similar haemodynamic responses to dobutamine.

Design

Single centre, single blind, randomised, two period crossover study comparing carvedilol with metoprolol CR/XL.

Patients

Ten patients with stable chronic congestive heart failure (ejection fraction < 40%) on chronic treatment with metoprolol CR/XL.

Methods

Patients were treated with carvedilol or metoprolol CR/XL (target dose 50 mg twice daily and 200 mg once daily, respectively) for eight weeks. Stress echocardiography was undertaken at the end of each maintenance period, using dobutamine 5 and 15 microg/kg/min.

Results

No significant haemodynamic differences were seen at rest on the two treatments. There was a more pronounced increase in heart rate and cardiac output during dobutamine infusion when the patients were on metoprolol than when they were on carvedilol. Mean arterial pressure increased significantly when the patients were on carvedilol, and cardiac output increased during low dose dobutamine, without further change during high dose dobutamine. During the dobutamine infusion, there was no significant difference in ejection fraction between carvedilol and metoprolol treatment.

Conclusions

Patients with congestive heart failure on a non-selective beta adrenoreceptor blocker or beta1 selective blocker responded differently to the inotropic drug dobutamine: the beta1 blockade caused by metoprolol could be counteracted by dobutamine, whereas with carvedilol a low dose of dobutamine increased cardiac output, and a higher dose of dobutamine caused a pressor effect. These findings may be clinically relevant when choosing an inotropic drug.

### Experts consensus recommendations for the management of calcium channel blocker poisoning in adults [^d76b52be]. Critical Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Observational studies, case series (,–), and animal studies document an improvement in contractility, blood pressure, and a potential increase in survival with the use of high-dose insulin in CCB-poisoned patients. Considering that high-dose insulin seems to have a direct positive inotropic effect, the workgroup recommended its use in the face of documented myocardial dysfunction, but still suggested if myocardial dysfunction is not documented because case series documented hemodynamic improvement even with dihydropyridines poisoning. Despite the fact that high-dose insulin requires intensive monitoring, its benefits were thought to outweigh the risks such as hypoglycemia, hypokalemia, or volume overload. The proposed dose regimen of high-dose insulin (regular insulin) includes a bolus of 1 U/kg followed by an infusion of 1 U/kg/hr with maintenance of euglycemia with a dextrose infusion as needed and close monitoring of serum potassium. Because titration of high-dose insulin to response up to 10 U/kg/hr is supported only by case series, the workgroup suggests to use this dosage only for patients who do not respond to first-line therapies.

The selection of vasopressors should be guided by the type of shock. Based on mechanism of action, the workgroup recommended the use of norepinephrine to increase blood pressure in vasoplegic shock or if myocardial function has not yet been assessed. The use of epinephrine is also recommended for a CCB-poisoned patient in shock to increase contractility and heart rate. In the presence of confirmed myocardial dysfunction, clinicians can also use dobutamine. High infusion rates of vasopressors and inotropes may be required.

Based on inconsistent hemodynamic improvement in case series, the workgroup suggest not to use dopamine. The use of vasopressin alone was discouraged due to lack of efficacy and worsened survival in animal models. The workgroup could not make recommendations regarding the use of vasopressin as an adjunct to other vasopressors as there is little documented clinical experience. No agreement was reached for the use of phenylephrine in CCB-poisoned patients.

### Definition of dobutamine-NCI drug dictionary… [^f193590f]. NCI (2011). Low credibility.

dobutamine A synthetic catecholamine with sympathomimetic activity. Dobutamine is a direct-acting inotropic agent and an adrenergic agonist that stimulates primarily the beta-1 adrenoceptor, with lesser effect on beta-2 or alpha receptors. Via beta-1 adrenoceptor of the heart, this agent induces positive inotropic effect with minimal changes in chronotropic activities or systemic vascular resistance. Dobutamine also causes vasodilation by stimulating beta-2 adrenergic receptors in blood vessels, augmented by reflex vasoconstriction resulting in increased cardiac output.

### Milrinone as compared with dobutamine in the treatment of cardiogenic shock [^c0fb0031]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2021). Excellent credibility.

The study DOREMI was published by Rebecca Mathew and colleagues in 2021 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Cardiogenic shock. In the DOREMI study, the trial question was: is milrinone superior to dobutamine for the treatment of cardiogenic shock? In the DOREMI study, the study design was: single center, double blinded, RCT. In the DOREMI study, the population was: 192 patients (70 female, 122 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients with cardiogenic shock. The key exclusion criteria were pregnancy, out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, healthcare team preference for use of specific inotrope. In the DOREMI study, the interventions were: n = 96 milrinone (at a dose of 0.125 mcg/kg/min to > 0.500 mcg/kg/min) n = 96 dobutamine (at a dose of 2.5 mcg/kg/min to > 10.0 mcg/kg/min). In the DOREMI study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in in-hospital death from any cause, resuscitated cardiac arrest, receipt of a cardiac transplant or mechanical circulatory support, nonfatal myocardial infarction, TIA or stroke diagnosed by a neurologist, or initiation of RRT (49% vs. 54%; RR 0.9, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.19). In the DOREMI study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in in-hospital death (37% vs. 43%; RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.6 to 1.21) No significant difference in resuscitated cardiac arrest (7% vs. 9%; HR 0.78, 95% CI 0.29 to 2.07) No significant difference in receipt of mechanical circulatory support (12% vs. 15%; HR 0.78, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.71). In the DOREMI study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in serum lactate level, serum creatinine level, HR, arrhythmias. In the DOREMI study, the conclusion was: in adult patients with cardiogenic shock, milrinone was not superior to dobutamine with respect to a in-hospital death from any cause, resuscitated cardiac arrest, receipt of a cardiac transplant or mechanical circulatory support, nonfatal myocardial infarction, TIA or stroke diagnosed by a neurologist, or initiation of RRT.

### Dobutamine injection, USP… [^ace9c291]. FDA (DailyMed) (2023). Medium credibility.

Dobutamine is a direct-acting inotropic agent whose primary activity results from stimulation of the β receptors of the heart while producing comparatively mild chronotropic, hypertensive, arrhythmogenic, and vasodilative effects. It does not cause the release of endogenous norepinephrine, as does dopamine. In animal studies, dobutamine produces less increase in heart rate and less decrease in peripheral vascular resistance for a given inotropic effect than does isoproterenol. In patients with depressed cardiac function, both dobutamine and isoproterenol increase the cardiac output to a similar degree. In the case of dobutamine, this increase is usually not accompanied by marked increases in heart rate, and the cardiac stroke volume is usually increased. In contrast, isoproterenol increases the cardiac index primarily by increasing the heart rate while stroke volume changes little or declines.

Facilitation of atrioventricular conduction has been observed in human electrophysiologic studies and in patients with atrial fibrillation. Systemic vascular resistance is usually decreased with administration of dobutamine. Occasionally, minimum vasoconstriction has been observed. Most clinical experience with dobutamine is short-term − not more than several hours in duration. In the limited number of patients who were studied for 24, 48, and 72 hours, a persistent increase in cardiac output occurred in some, whereas output returned toward baseline values in others. The onset of action of dobutamine is within 1 to 2 minutes; however, as much as 10 minutes may be required to obtain the peak effect of a particular infusion rate. The plasma half-life of dobutamine in humans is 2 minutes. The principal routes of metabolism are methylation of the catechol and conjugation. In human urine, the major excretion products are the conjugates of dobutamine and 3-O-methyl dobutamine.

The 3-O-methyl derivative of dobutamine is inactive. Signs and Symptoms − Toxicity from dobutamine is usually due to excessive cardiac β-receptor stimulation. The duration of action of dobutamine is generally short because it is rapidly metabolized by catechol-O-methyltransferase. The symptoms of toxicity may include anorexia, nausea, vomiting, tremor, anxiety, palpitations, headache, shortness of breath, and anginal and nonspecific chest pain.

### Cardiovascular response to dobutamine stress predicts outcome in severe sepsis and septic shock [^548a62f6]. Critical Care (2008). Low credibility.

### The effects of dobutamine on cardiac sympathetic activity in patients with congestive heart failure [^7bb4a898]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2002). Low credibility.

Objectives

The goal of this work was to study the effects of short-term infusion of dobutamine on efferent cardiac sympathetic activity.

Background

Increased efferent cardiac sympathetic activity is associated with poor outcomes in the setting of congestive heart failure (CHF). Dobutamine is commonly used in the therapy of decompensated CHF. Dobutamine, through its effects on excitatory beta-receptors, may increase cardiac sympathetic activity.

Methods

Seven patients with normal left ventricular (LV) function and 13 patients with CHF were studied. A radiotracer technique was used to measure cardiac norepinephrine spillover (CANESP) before and during an intravenous infusion of dobutamine titrated to increase the rate of rise in LV peak positive pressure (+dP/dt) by 40%.

Results

Systemic arterial pulse pressure increased significantly in response to dobutamine in the normal LV function group (74 ± 3 mm Hg to 85 ± 3 mm Hg, p = 0.005) but remained unchanged in the CHF group. Dobutamine caused a significant decrease in LV end-diastolic pressure in the CHF group (14 ± 2 mm Hg to 11 ± 2 mm Hg, p = 0.02), an effect not observed in the normal LV group. In the normal LV function group, CANESP did not change in response to dobutamine (75 ± 22 pmol/min vs. 72 ± 22 pmol/min, p = NS). In contrast, dobutamine infusion was associated with a significant reduction in CANESP in patients with CHF (199 ± 43 pmol/min to 128 ± 30 pmol/min, p < 0.0009).

Conclusions

Dobutamine infusion caused a significant sympatholytic response in patients with CHF. This sympathetic withdrawal response is probably related to reduction of LV filling pressures and/or activation of ventricular mechanoreceptors with dobutamine infusion.

### Trials and tribulations of inotrope choice in cardiogenic shock with renal dysfunction [^07c87af6]. JACC: Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Table 1
Clinical Considerations Relevant to Acute Renal Dysfunction in the ICU and Implications for ICU Care Teams

The authors stratified the DOREMI trial population based on both baseline renal dysfunction and the development of AKI. Most patients had AKI — 124 of the 192 subjects enrolled. Main clinical findings included the fact that, in the stratum of patients with cardiogenic shock without AKI, milrinone was associated with better outcomes than dobutamine (relative risk: 0.48; 95% CI: 0.24–0.97 for composite primary outcome). Such an effect was not observed in cardiogenic shock patients with AKI, where there was no difference between the strategies (relative risk: 1.06; 95% CI: 0.78–1.46). The authors conclude that a potential clinical benefit of milrinone vs dobutamine in cardiogenic shock could be attenuated by development of AKI.

The author's conclusions have a plausible physiologic mechanism, and they should be congratulated for adding to the evidence base in this understudied area. A second point is that randomized trials are rare in cardiac critical care, and the data from successful randomized trial such as DOREMI should be leveraged to the full extent to increase knowledge and improve care. Limitations of the study include the post hoc nature of the study which was not prespecified in the DOREMI protocol. As such, the conclusions should be considered hypothesis generating. Subgroup analyses, particularly in small trials such as DOREMI, can be simultaneously underpowered and overpowered leading to risk of false positive and false negative findings. A second consideration is that the exposure of dobutamine vs milrinone was assigned at baseline yet the stratification variable of AKI could occur subsequently at time > 0. Thus, interactions between the exposure variable and the stratification variable are possible and could introduce bias.

### Evaluation and management of right-sided heart failure: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^567c1172]. Circulation (2018). Medium credibility.

Augment contractility — inotropes should be considered when CO or BP are inadequate, as in broad terms they augment myocardial contractility and augment failing RV SV while reducing RV end-diastolic volume and pressure; milrinone and dobutamine have combined inotropic and vasodilator properties and can precipitate or worsen hypotension, although this is less likely if LV preload is adequate and their use results in improved CO; direct comparisons show similar clinical outcomes, including similar hemodynamic efficacy and arrhythmogenic potential; compared with dobutamine, milrinone leads to greater reductions in RV and LV end-diastolic pressure, less commonly causes tachycardia, may be considered a more rational choice with concomitant β-blocker therapy, and is less prone to drug tolerance during prolonged infusions; however, milrinone is more likely than dobutamine to provoke hypotension, bolus-related and less easily reversed by discontinuation, and given the long half-life vasopressor support may be necessary, with renal clearance necessitating consideration of estimated glomerular filtration rate for dosing.

### The management of heart failure cardiogenic shock: an international RAND appropriateness panel [^b12e6202]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Responses of the panel to the final survey suggested that despite an absence of societal guideline or randomised trial data to inform practice there were many aspects of care where there was alignment of approach. There was very little disagreement between experts; the DI was significant (DI > 1) only when addressing the role of thoracic ultrasound in the immediate management of HF-CS. Nonetheless, there remains considerable equipoise as evidenced by just under half (16/34) of statements being rated as uncertain (Fig. 1).

A priori, the expert panel agreed that the management of HF-CS required different approaches and considerations to that of AMI-CS. This reflected clinical observations: 1) pulmonary, venous and visceral congestion were more prevalent at baseline in HF-CS; 2) patients are often ambulatory despite profound derangements in measured cardiac output, cardiac filling pressures and transpulmonary pressure gradients; 3) markers of hypoperfusion, such as capillary refill time, elevation of lactate or derangements of organ function are often comparatively preserved in patients with HF-CS. The initial supportive management of HF-CS is to restore organ perfusion to mitigate progression towards multi-organ failure. This may or may not require normalization of haemodynamics. Concordant with societal guidance, panellists agreed that norepinephrine is an appropriate first line vasopressor with uncertainty surrounding the use of dopamine. Dobutamine as the first line inotrope was deemed appropriate whilst milrinone as first line was uncertain. These data align with a recent international survey of CS treatment strategies across 60 countries. RCT data demonstrated no significant difference in a composite outcome including death, cardiac arrest and receipt of tMCS between milrinone and dobutamine in a cohort with mixed aetiology CS. Nonetheless, experts noted that the divergent half-lives of dobutamine and milrinone impacted inotrope selection, particularly in the cohort with more profound hypotension. Of note, recent RCT data suggested no increased dysrhythmia with dobutamine therapy nor greater hypotension with milrinone. There remains low certainty that inotropes per se offer benefit and may cause harm. The CAPITAL DOREMI 2 RCT (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT05267886) will assess the efficacy and safety of inotropes (dobutamine and milrinone) compared to placebo in all-cause SCAI Stage C/D CS. Imaging with point of care echocardiography in the initial assessment of patients with SCAI stage C HF-CS was deemed appropriate, in alignment with consensus guidance. Routine use of thoracic point of care ultrasound was the only area of statistical disagreement (DI > 1). Thoracic ultrasound is a rapid, bedside tool that may have high sensitivity and specificity for identifying the severity of pulmonary congestion which may add diagnostic and prognostic value but panellists deemed that any uplift in diagnostic or therapeutic certainty beyond thorough clinical examination was limited and that widespread use was limited by a lack of training, particularly in North America. The role of PAC and haemodynamic profiling in the initial assessment of CS was similarly deemed uncertain. Immediate classification of HF-CS into biventricular, LV, or right ventricular dominant haemodynamic phenotypes may have therapeutic implications including choice of inopressor or modality of tMCS and confer prognostic value but experts opined that such classification could be derived from routine clinical and biochemical parameters without the potential management delays and complications associated with immediate PAC placement. Recent data in a HF-CS population demonstrated that PAC use was associated with lower in-hospital mortality and early (< 6 hours) placement was associated with a more pronounced reduction in mortality compared to either delayed (> 48 hours) or no PAC. Of note, and consistent with the panel recommendations below, there was no clear signal of mortality benefit with PAC placement between 6 and 48 hours. This uncertainty will be formally tested by the Pulmonary Artery Catheter in Cardiogenic Shock Trial (PACCS ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT05485376).

### Inotropic agents and vasodilator strategies for the treatment of cardiogenic shock or low cardiac output syndrome [^c65ac153]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Cardiogenic shock (CS) and low cardiac output syndrome (LCOS) are potentially life-threatening complications of acute myocardial infarction (AMI), heart failure (HF) or cardiac surgery. While there is solid evidence for the treatment of other cardiovascular diseases of acute onset, treatment strategies in haemodynamic instability due to CS and LCOS remains less robustly supported by the given scientific literature. Therefore, we have analysed the current body of evidence for the treatment of CS or LCOS with inotropic and/or vasodilating agents. This is the second update of a Cochrane review originally published in 2014.

Objectives

Assessment of efficacy and safety of cardiac care with positive inotropic agents and vasodilator agents in CS or LCOS due to AMI, HF or after cardiac surgery.

Search Methods

We conducted a search in CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and CPCI-S Web of Science in October 2019. We also searched four registers of ongoing trials and scanned reference lists and contacted experts in the field to obtain further information. No language restrictions were applied.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) enrolling patients with AMI, HF or cardiac surgery complicated by CS or LCOS.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures according to Cochrane standards.

Main Results

We identified 19 eligible studies including 2385 individuals (mean or median age range 56 to 73 years) and three ongoing studies. We categorised studies into 11 comparisons, all against standard cardiac care and additional other drugs or placebo. These comparisons investigated the efficacy of levosimendan versus dobutamine, enoximone or placebo; enoximone versus dobutamine, piroximone or epinephrine-nitroglycerine; epinephrine versus norepinephrine or norepinephrine-dobutamine; dopexamine versus dopamine; milrinone versus dobutamine and dopamine-milrinone versus dopamine-dobutamine. All trials were published in peer-reviewed journals, and analyses were done by the intention-to-treat (ITT) principle. Eighteen of 19 trials were small with only a few included participants. An acknowledgement of funding by the pharmaceutical industry or missing conflict of interest statements occurred in nine of 19 trials. In general, confidence in the results of analysed studies was reduced due to relevant study limitations (risk of bias), imprecision or indirectness. Domains of concern, which showed a high risk in more than 50% of included studies, encompassed performance bias (blinding of participants and personnel) and bias affecting the quality of evidence on adverse events. All comparisons revealed uncertainty on the effect of inotropic/vasodilating drugs on all-cause mortality with a low to very low quality of evidence. In detail, the findings were: levosimendan versus dobutamine (short-term mortality: RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.03; participants = 1701; low-quality evidence; long-term mortality: RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.13; participants = 1591; low-quality evidence); levosimendan versus placebo (short-term mortality: no data available; long-term mortality: RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.16 to 1.90; participants = 55; very low-quality evidence); levosimendan versus enoximone (short-term mortality: RR 0.50, 0.22 to 1.14; participants = 32; very low-quality evidence; long-term mortality: no data available); epinephrine versus norepinephrine-dobutamine (short-term mortality: RR 1.25; 95% CI 0.41 to 3.77; participants = 30; very low-quality evidence; long-term mortality: no data available); dopexamine versus dopamine (short-term mortality: no deaths in either intervention arm; participants = 70; very low-quality evidence; long-term mortality: no data available); enoximone versus dobutamine (short-term mortality RR 0.21; 95% CI 0.01 to 4.11; participants = 27; very low-quality evidence; long-term mortality: no data available); epinephrine versus norepinephrine (short-term mortality: RR 1.81, 0.89 to 3.68; participants = 57; very low-quality evidence; long-term mortality: no data available); and dopamine-milrinone versus dopamine-dobutamine (short-term mortality: RR 1.0, 95% CI 0.34 to 2.93; participants = 20; very low-quality evidence; long-term mortality: no data available). No information regarding all-cause mortality were available for the comparisons milrinone versus dobutamine, enoximone versus piroximone and enoximone versus epinephrine-nitroglycerine.

Authors' Conclusions

At present, there are no convincing data supporting any specific inotropic or vasodilating therapy to reduce mortality in haemodynamically unstable patients with CS or LCOS. Considering the limited evidence derived from the present data due to a high risk of bias and imprecision, it should be emphasised that there is an unmet need for large-scale, well-designed randomised trials on this topic to close the gap between daily practice in critical care of cardiovascular patients and the available evidence. In light of the uncertainties in the field, partially due to the underlying methodological flaws in existing studies, future RCTs should be carefully designed to potentially overcome given limitations and ultimately define the role of inotropic agents and vasodilator strategies in CS and LCOS.

### Volume and its relationship to cardiac output and venous return [^2e6dff74]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Adrenergic drugs

The study on the effect of the baroreceptor response to hypotension discussed above gives insight into the response of the peripheral circulation to infusions of norepinephrine. Besides the expected increase in systemic arterial resistance, norepinephrine constricts the splanchnic venous compartment and increases stressed volume. It potentially dilates or at least does not constrict the venous drainage from the splanchnic bed. This is because activation of alpha-adrenergic receptors constricts the venous drainage of the splanchnic vasculature whereas beta-adrenergic receptors dilate it. Through its beta-adrenergic activity norepinephrine increases cardiac function and has little effect on pulmonary vessels. The increase in precapillary resistance vessels and the decrease in right atrial pressure with the improvement in cardiac function could potentially decrease capillary filtration and thus could reduce edema formation. However, it is possible that very high levels of norepinephrine compromise the normal distribution of flow and compromise organ function. Epinephrine likely works in the same way except that it generally produces a greater increase in heart rate, which could produce problems by shortening diastole and producing unexpected changes in distribution of flow due to the limits of time constants in different vascular beds, on both the arterial and venous side.

The response of the circuit to phenylephrine is very different from the response to norepinephrine because it only has alpha-adrenergic activity. Although phenylephrine can constrict the splanchnic capacitance vessels, it increases the venous resistance draining this region and the net effect on venous return depends upon how much volume is recruited versus how much the downstream resistance increases. In most critically ill patients capacitance reserves are reduced so that the net effect with phenylephrine is decreased splanchnic drainage and decreased venous return. Phenylephrine also does not increase cardiac function so that cardiac output most often falls.

Besides increasing cardiac contractility, an effective inotrope must also alter circuit properties to increase venous return. The circuit properties of dobutamine have not been well studied but we observed in dogs (unpublished data) that dobutamine decreased the resistance draining splanchnic vessels as observed with isoproterenol and also increased MSFP. The latter likely occurred because the d-isomer of dobutamine has alpha-adrenergic activity and thus could constrict capacitance vessels. These circuit adaptations thus combine with dobutamine's inotropic effects on the heart to increase cardiac output. This also would predict that the effect of dobutamine would be best when there are adequate reserves in unstressed volume to be recruited so that volume infusions could potentially augment its action.

### ACC / AHA 2005 guideline update for the diagnosis and management of chronic heart failure in the adult: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on practice guidelines (writing committee to update the 2001 guidelines for the evaluation and management of heart failure): developed in collaboration with the American College of Chest Physicians and the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation: endorsed by the Heart Rhythm Society [^12570e63]. Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Advanced heart failure (HF) — management of fluid status includes that control of fluid retention may require progressive increments in the loop diuretic dose and frequently the addition of a second diuretic that has a complementary mode of action (e.g., metolazone). If volume overload persists despite these measures, hospitalization is generally required for further adjustment of therapy, possibly including intravenous dopamine or dobutamine, and ultrafiltration or hemodialysis may be needed to achieve adequate control of fluid retention; the use of such mechanical methods of fluid removal can produce meaningful clinical benefits and may restore responsiveness to conventional doses of loop diuretics. In general, patients should not be discharged from the hospital until a stable and effective diuretic regimen is established, and ideally, not until euvolemia is achieved, after which the patient's dry weight can guide dose adjustments; many patients are able to modify their own diuretic regimen in response to changes in weight that exceed a predefined range. The restriction of dietary sodium (to 2 g a day or less) can greatly assist in the maintenance of volume balance, and patients with persistent or recurrent fluid retention despite sodium restriction and high-dose diuretic use may benefit from review of fluid intake and restriction to 2 liters daily; the ongoing control of fluid retention may be enhanced by enrollment in an HF program.

### Inotropic agents and vasodilator strategies for the treatment of cardiogenic shock or low cardiac output syndrome [^b7ba3f82]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Cardiogenic shock (CS) and low cardiac output syndrome (LCOS) as complications of acute myocardial infarction (AMI), heart failure (HF) or cardiac surgery are life-threatening conditions. While there is a broad body of evidence for the treatment of people with acute coronary syndrome under stable haemodynamic conditions, the treatment strategies for people who become haemodynamically unstable or develop CS remain less clear. We have therefore summarised here the evidence on the treatment of people with CS or LCOS with different inotropic agents and vasodilative drugs. This is the first update of a Cochrane review originally published in 2014.

Objectives

To assess efficacy and safety of cardiac care with positive inotropic agents and vasodilator strategies in people with CS or LCOS due to AMI, HF or cardiac surgery.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and CPCI-S Web of Science in June 2017. We also searched four registers of ongoing trials and scanned reference lists and contacted experts in the field to obtain further information. No language restrictions were applied.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials in people with myocardial infarction, heart failure or cardiac surgery complicated by cardiogenic shock or LCOS.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.

Main Results

We identified 13 eligible studies with 2001 participants (mean or median age range 58 to 73 years) and two ongoing studies. We categorised studies into eight comparisons, all against cardiac care and additional other active drugs or placebo. These comparisons investigated the efficacy of levosimendan versus dobutamine, enoximone or placebo, epinephrine versus norepinephrine-dobutamine, amrinone versus dobutamine, dopexamine versus dopamine, enoximone versus dopamine and nitric oxide versus placebo. All trials were published in peer-reviewed journals, and analysis was done by the intention-to-treat (ITT) principle. Twelve of 13 trials were small with few included participants. Acknowledgement of funding by the pharmaceutical industry or missing conflict of interest statements emerged in five of 13 trials. In general, confidence in the results of analysed studies was reduced due to serious study limitations, very serious imprecision or indirectness. Domains of concern, which show a high risk of more than 50%, include performance bias (blinding of participants and personnel) and bias affecting the quality of evidence on adverse events. Levosimendan may reduce short-term mortality compared to a therapy with dobutamine (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.95; 6 studies; 1776 participants; low-quality evidence; NNT: 16 (patients with moderate risk), NNT: 5 (patients with CS)). This initial short-term survival benefit with levosimendan vs. dobutamine is not confirmed on long-term follow up. There is uncertainty (due to lack of statistical power) as to the effect of levosimendan compared to therapy with placebo (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.12 to 1.94; 2 studies; 55 participants, very low-quality evidence) or enoximone (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.22 to 1.14; 1 study; 32 participants, very low-quality evidence). All comparisons comparing other positive inotropic, inodilative or vasodilative drugs presented uncertainty on their effect on short-term mortality with very low-quality evidence and based on only one RCT. These single studies compared epinephrine with norepinephrine-dobutamine (RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.41 to 3.77; 30 participants), amrinone with dobutamine (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.04 to 2.85; 30 participants), dopexamine with dopamine (no in-hospital deaths from 70 participants), enoximone with dobutamine (two deaths from 40 participants) and nitric oxide with placebo (one death from three participants).

Authors' Conclusions

Apart from low quality of evidence data suggesting a short-term mortality benefit of levosimendan compared with dobutamine, at present there are no robust and convincing data to support a distinct inotropic or vasodilator drug-based therapy as a superior solution to reduce mortality in haemodynamically unstable people with cardiogenic shock or LCOS. Considering the limited evidence derived from the present data due to a generally high risk of bias and imprecision, it should be emphasised that there remains a great need for large, well-designed randomised trials on this topic to close the gap between daily practice in critical care medicine and the available evidence. It seems to be useful to apply the concept of 'early goal-directed therapy' in cardiogenic shock and LCOS with early haemodynamic stabilisation within predefined timelines. Future clinical trials should therefore investigate whether such a therapeutic concept would influence survival rates much more than looking for the 'best' drug for haemodynamic support.

### DOBUTAMINE… [^84d1d51d]. FDA (DailyMed) (2011). Low credibility.

Dobutamine is a direct-acting inotropic agent whose primary activity results from stimulation of the β receptors of the heart while producing comparatively mild chronotropic, hypertensive, arrhythmogenic, and vasodilative effects. It does not cause the release of endogenous norepinephrine, as does dopamine. In animal studies, dobutamine produces less increase in heart rate and less decrease in peripheral vascular resistance for a given inotropic effect than does isoproterenol. In patients with depressed cardiac function, both dobutamine and isoproterenol increase the cardiac output to a similar degree. In the case of dobutamine, this increase is usually not accompanied by marked increases in heart rate, and the cardiac stroke volume is usually increased. In contrast, isoproterenol increases the cardiac index primarily by increasing the heart rate while stroke volume changes little or declines.

Facilitation of atrioventricular conduction has been observed in human electrophysiologic studies and in patients with atrial fibrillation. Systemic vascular resistance is usually decreased with administration of dobutamine. Occasionally, minimum vasoconstriction has been observed. Most clinical experience with dobutamine is short-term-not more than several hours in duration. In the limited number of patients who were studied for 24, 48, and 72 hours, a persistent increase in cardiac output occurred in some, whereas output returned toward baseline values in others. The onset of action of dobutamine is within 1 to 2 minutes; however, as much as 10 minutes may be required to obtain the peak effect of a particular infusion rate. The plasma half-life of dobutamine in humans is 2 minutes. The principal routes of metabolism are methylation of the catechol and conjugation. In human urine, the major excretion products are the conjugates of dobutamine and 3-O-methyl dobutamine.

The 3-O-methyl derivative of dobutamine is inactive. Alteration of synaptic concentrations of catecholamines with either reserpine or tricyclic antidepressants does not alter the actions of dobutamine in animals, which indicates that the actions of dobutamine are not dependent on presynaptic mechanisms. Dobutamine injection is indicated when parenteral therapy is necessary for inotropic support in the short-term treatment of adults with cardiac decompensation due to depressed contractility resulting either from organic heart disease or from cardiac surgical procedures.

### Bench-to-bedside review: inotropic drug therapy after adult cardiac surgery – a systematic literature review [^3d0b4dad]. Critical Care (2005). Low credibility.

Many adult patients require temporary inotropic support after cardiac surgery. We reviewed the literature systematically to establish, present and classify the evidence regarding choice of inotropic drugs. The available evidence, while limited in quality and scope, supports the following observations; although all beta-agonists can increase cardiac output, the best studied beta-agonist and the one with the most favourable side-effect profile appears to be dobutamine. Dobutamine and phosphodiesterase inhibitors (PDIs) are efficacious inotropic drugs for management of the low cardiac output syndrome. Dobutamine is associated with a greater incidence of tachycardia and tachyarrhythmias, whereas PDIs often require the administration of vasoconstrictors. Other catecholamines have no clear advantages over dobutamine. PDIs increase the likelihood of successful weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass as compared with placebo. There is insufficient evidence that inotropic drugs should be selected for their effects on regional perfusion. PDIs also increase flow through arterial grafts, reduce mean pulmonary artery pressure and improve right heart performance in pulmonary hypertension. Insufficient data exist to allow selection of a specific inotropic agent in preference over another in adult cardiac surgery patients. Multicentre randomized controlled trials focusing on clinical rather than physiological outcomes are needed.

Conclusions

The results from this network meta-analysis suggest that the use of norepinephrine plus dobutamine was associated with lower 28-day mortality for septic shock, especially among patients with low cardiac output.

PERSPECTIVES

COMPETENCY IN MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE: Renal dysfunction is a prevalent comorbidity and a common sequelae of end-organ hypoperfusion in patients with cardiogenic shock. Significant renal dysfunction is both an indicator and a mediator of a worse prognosis in patients with cardiogenic shock and an important clinical consideration when choosing pharmacotherapies and timing interventions requiring iodinated-contrast agents. At present, there is a paucity of prospective data examining the relative efficacy and safety of milrinone in patients with cardiogenic shock and renal dysfunction.

TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK: Future studies should further explore the association between milrinone and outcomes in patients with cardiogenic shock and renal dysfunction.

### Randomized trial of dobutamine versus dopamine in preterm infants with low systemic blood flow [^03dcac21]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

Our purpose was to determine if dobutamine or dopamine results in greater improvements in systemic blood flow in very preterm infants with low flow during the first 24 hours of life.

Study Design

A 2-center, randomized, double-blind study. Infants (n = 42) with low superior vena cava (SVC) flow (< 41 mL/kg/min) in the first 12 hours were randomly assigned to receive 10 mL/kg normal saline solution, followed by 10 microg/kg/minute of dobutamine or dopamine. If low flow persisted or recurred, the inotrope was increased to 20 microg/kg/minute, with crossover to the other inotrope if treatment failed to maintain flow.

Results

Volume produced a more significant increase in SVC flow than dopamine (+43%). At the highest dose, dobutamine resulted in a significantly greater increase in SVC flow than dopamine (mean, +9.9 vs -3.2 mL/kg/min, P = 0.02). Dopamine resulted in a significantly greater increase in blood pressure. Infants receiving dobutamine only at 24 hours had a greater right ventricular output than infants receiving dopamine (mean, 295 vs 167 mL/kg/min, P < .001). Forty percent failed to increase or maintain SVC flow in response to either inotrope. No significant differences in mortality or morbidity were found.

Conclusions

Dobutamine produced a greater increase in blood flow than dopamine.

### Impact of baseline β-blocker use on inotrope response and clinical outcomes in cardiogenic shock: a subgroup analysis of the DOREMI trial [^39d2efe1]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Cardiogenic shock (CS) is defined as a state of low cardiac output resulting in clinical and biochemical manifestations of end-organ hypoperfusion. 1,2 The evidence base to guide the medical management of patients with CS has been limited to date. In this context, the recent DObutamine compaREd to MIlrinone (DOREMI) trial compared dobutamine and milrinone in patients with CS, finding no differences in outcomes between inotropes. 3

Beta-blockers (BBs) are commonly used in patients with cardiovascular disease, including for the management of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction 4−6 and cardiac arrhythmias. 7,8 Accordingly, it is not uncommon for patients presenting with CS to have recently received BB therapy — a treatment with known hemodynamic effects. The negative impact of inotropes with concomitant BB therapy in acute decompensated heart failure has been established previously. 9,10 Moreover, dobutamine — a synthetic catecholamine with beta-1 and beta-2 receptor agonism — has been suggested to be less effective as an inotrope in the setting of BB therapy. 11 The impact of baseline BB therapy on clinical outcomes or the efficacy of dobutamine in BB-treated patients presenting with CS has not been previously described.

We hypothesized that patients with BB use in the 24 h before developing CS would have worse clinical outcomes and hemodynamic parameters owing to its negative inotropic effects. We further hypothesized that dobutamine would be less effective as an inotrope in this context. Therefore, we evaluated the clinical outcomes and hemodynamic response profiles in patients with CS treated with BB as a subgroup analysis of the DOREMI trial.

BB-R12 as Inotropic Therapy

Inotropic agents have been shown to be effective for both short- and long-term treatment of HF, but their utility has been limited primarily by safety concerns. These inotropic agents work upstream of calcium signaling and myosin contractions via stimulation of the adrenergic system (dopamine, dobutamine, norepinephrine) or by inhibiting phosphodiesterase and cAMP production (milrinone, vesnarinone, enoximone) (Figure 1A). Briefly, these safety problems are tachyarrhythmias and myocardial ischemia/hypotension due to the primary mechanisms of action (i.e. "on-mechanism" but off-target). The promise of new therapies targeting calcium-cycling or activating myosin is that these work downstream from the signaling mechanisms that can cause the side effects. This more targeted mechanism may yield a more acceptable benefit–risk profile.

### Impact of baseline β-blocker use on inotrope response and clinical outcomes in cardiogenic shock: a subgroup analysis of the DOREMI trial [^252144f5]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In patients with CS who were treated with BBs in the 24 h prior to initiating inotropic therapy, there were fewer deaths and resuscitated cardiac arrests in the early resuscitation period, although this difference was no longer present by hospital discharge. BB therapy was not associated with an impaired hemodynamic response to inotropic therapy in CS, including with dobutamine. Modulating arrhythmic risk in CS may offer a mechanism to reduce adverse outcomes in CS.
