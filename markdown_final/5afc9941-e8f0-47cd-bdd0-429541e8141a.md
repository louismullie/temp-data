## Question

Are there any medications to treat the "tourniquet" sensation that persists as a residual effect of a thalamic stroke?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which medications can treat a persistent "tourniquet sensation" after a thalamic stroke. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what this symptom likely represents pathophysiologically and whether it maps onto central post-stroke pain or dysesthesia. Then, I should verify the lesion–symptom correlations that make thalamic pain plausible. Next, I will review the evidence base for pharmacologic options, distinguish first-line from second-line agents, and appraise the quality and limits of that evidence. After that, I should consider nonpharmacologic adjuncts for refractory cases. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stepwise plan that includes diagnostic confirmation, therapeutic sequencing, safety monitoring, and referral thresholds, while keeping in mind the variability in response across thalamic lesion locations [^1174TuEt] [^114yY7hj].

> Let me first confirm what this "tourniquet sensation" likely signifies clinically, because "tourniquet" is not a standard term; patients often use it to describe constricting, tight, band-like dysesthesias characteristic of central neuropathic pain following thalamic injury, sometimes labeled thalamic pain syndrome or central post-stroke pain, which frequently follows damage at the border of the ventral posterior nucleus and pulvinar with spinothalamic pathway involvement, producing ongoing dysesthesia, cold–burning pain, and paradoxical tightness sensations, including "cramplike" thalamic pain descriptions that fit this phenomenology [^1174TuEt] [^111bULLL] [^112zwoic] [^116q81rJ] [^115h93GA].

> I should double-check the epidemiology and therapeutic difficulty to set expectations before recommending medications, because thalamic-origin central pain is relatively common yet underrecognized after stroke and often resistant to treatment; estimates suggest up to roughly 10% of stroke survivors develop central post-stroke pain and long-term cohorts highlight pain and discomfort as frequent, persistent problems after isolated thalamic stroke, underscoring why a methodical but realistic pharmacologic plan is needed [^1174TuEt] [^114yY7hj] [^114Sq6Hm].

> Next, I will examine first-line pharmacologic options; I initially thought serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors would dominate, but wait, let me verify the central post-stroke pain data, because in CPSP the most consistently supported first-line classes are tricyclic antidepressants and certain anticonvulsants, with amitriptyline, gabapentin, and lamotrigine repeatedly cited as having benefit in central pain syndromes, and case evidence supports gabapentin's effect specifically in CPSP, while pregabalin is commonly used clinically though high-quality CPSP data are limited compared with gabapentin and lamotrigine [^114yY7hj] [^115HwFeY] [^1174TuEt] [^112TcPqC] [^1138DvmY].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about effect sizes; I need to check the highest-quality synthesis, and the 2015 systematic review of randomized trials concluded that most tested therapies, including anticonvulsants, antidepressants, and other modalities, had little to no average effect on CPSP, which means I should frame any medication recommendation with careful expectation management and emphasize individualized trials with systematic assessment of benefit and tolerability [^113MphAd].

> I will now consider second-line or adjunctive options for refractory cases; opioids sometimes appear in regimens or as bridge therapy, but I should confirm safety concerns because opioid-induced hyperalgesia and tolerance are real risks, and regulatory guidance emphasizes careful monitoring and restraint in dose escalation, while small reports describe intravenous lidocaine or cannabinoids such as a 1:1 THC:CBD oromucosal spray benefiting individual CPSP cases after multiple standard failures, supporting cautious, selective trialing when first-line agents are inadequate or poorly tolerated [^115HwFeY] [^115vz2Kp] [^1138DvmY].

> But wait, what if medications fail despite best efforts; I need to review nonpharmacologic neuromodulation options, keeping in mind evidence quality; motor cortex stimulation and thalamic or periventricular gray deep brain stimulation have shown analgesic responses in selected refractory CPSP cases, sometimes with concurrent normalization of sensory measures, though durability can wane and the evidence base remains limited; noninvasive options such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation can provide relief but often require repeated sessions and access to specialized centers, so these should be reserved for carefully selected refractory patients with specialist input [^113ts3NB] [^116be3ZG] [^112PUbeV] [^115a5V8T] [^113ad1jh].

> Before locking in the diagnosis, I should confirm that this is truly central post-stroke dysesthesia rather than a peripheral or regional pain syndrome, because management diverges; that means reviewing for alternative explanations such as complex regional pain syndrome, radiculopathy, peripheral neuropathy, musculoskeletal pathology, medication-induced dysesthesia, and metabolic contributors, and correlating the sensory pattern with the known thalamic lesion topography and spinothalamic deficits that increase CPSP risk, especially when lesions involve the ventral posterior–pulvinar border or anterior pulvinar with documented spinothalamic dysfunction [^111hJdVC] [^116q81rJ] [^112zwoic].

> Let me think about a practical stepwise approach; first, confirm the central mechanism by mapping symptoms to contralesional sensory abnormalities and prior imaging, and exclude peripheral mimics; second, initiate a first-line agent such as amitriptyline, gabapentin, or lamotrigine with slow titration, watching for anticholinergic or mood effects with TCAs and rash risk with lamotrigine, and consider pregabalin as an alternative when pharmacokinetics or tolerability favor it; third, if partial response occurs, I should consider rational combination therapy drawn from different classes, while tracking pain, function, mood, and sleep; fourth, if refractory, trial carefully selected second-line options like cannabinoids in jurisdictions where available or short, closely monitored opioid courses, and refer to a pain or neuromodulation center to evaluate candidacy for rTMS, motor cortex stimulation, or DBS; throughout, I need to recalibrate expectations because even with guideline-concordant therapy, mean effect sizes can be modest and lesion location likely influences response [^114yY7hj] [^115HwFeY] [^113MphAd] [^116q81rJ] [^112zwoic].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost omitted safety pearls; I should double-check and remind that TCAs can precipitate neuropsychiatric effects post-stroke in susceptible patients, necessitating close monitoring and reconsideration if mood destabilization occurs, and opioids require vigilance for hyperalgesia and serotonergic interactions, reinforcing the preference for nonopioid neuropathic agents and nonpharmacologic adjuncts when feasible [^117B4eqn] [^115vz2Kp].

> In summary, yes, there are medication options for a "tourniquet" dysesthesia after thalamic stroke, most consistent with central post-stroke pain; first-line choices are tricyclic antidepressants and anticonvulsants such as amitriptyline, gabapentin, and lamotrigine, acknowledging that high-quality trials show small average effects and that careful, individualized trials, possible combinations, and escalation to cannabinoids or neuromodulation in refractory cases may be required, ideally under neurology or pain specialist co-management with ongoing diagnostic vigilance and functional outcome tracking [^114yY7hj] [^115HwFeY] [^113MphAd] [^1174TuEt].

Medications can alleviate the "tourniquet" sensation after thalamic stroke, but **relief is often partial and individualized**. First-line options include **amitriptyline or nortriptyline** and **gabapentin or pregabalin** [^114yY7hj]; duloxetine or venlafaxine are alternatives if these are ineffective. Second-line options include **lamotrigine, carbamazepine, or oxcarbazepine** [^115HwFeY] [^114yY7hj], and **tramadol or tapentadol** for severe cases [^115HwFeY]. If medications are inadequate, consider **rTMS** [^113ad1jh], **motor cortex stimulation** [^113ts3NB], or **deep brain stimulation** [^116be3ZG]. Combine pharmacotherapy with physical therapy and psychological support, and tailor treatment to response and side effects [^1174TuEt].

---

## Pharmacological management

Pharmacological management of CPSP seeks to **modulate central pain pathways** and reduce neuronal hyperexcitability [^1174TuEt].

---

### Antidepressants

Among antidepressants, **tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs)** — amitriptyline and nortriptyline — are first-line for CPSP [^114yY7hj] and modulate serotonin and norepinephrine pathways to reduce central pain perception [^1174TuEt]. **Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)** such as duloxetine and venlafaxine are alternatives, particularly for patients who cannot tolerate TCAs [^1174TuEt].

---

### Anticonvulsants

- **Gabapentin and pregabalin**: These medications are effective in reducing neuropathic pain by modulating calcium channels and reducing neuronal excitability [^114yY7hj] [^115HwFeY] [^112TcPqC].

- **Lamotrigine**: Particularly useful in patients with allodynia, lamotrigine stabilizes neuronal membranes and reduces hyperexcitability [^115HwFeY] [^1174TuEt].

- **Carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine**: These sodium channel blockers are effective in some patients, particularly those with paroxysmal pain episodes [^114yY7hj] [^1174TuEt].

---

### Opioids

For opioids, **tramadol and tapentadol** may be considered in severe cases, although their use is limited by potential side effects and dependency risks [^115HwFeY] [^1174TuEt].

---

## Non-pharmacological interventions

Given the limited efficacy of pharmacological treatments alone, **non-pharmacological interventions** are often recommended:

- **Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS)**: Non-invasive brain stimulation techniques have shown promise in reducing CPSP symptoms [^113ad1jh].

- **Motor cortex stimulation (MCS)**: Invasive neuromodulation techniques, such as MCS, have demonstrated efficacy in refractory cases [^113ts3NB].

- **Deep brain stimulation (DBS)**: Although results are variable, DBS targeting the thalamus or periaqueductal gray may provide relief in selected patients [^116be3ZG] [^112PUbeV].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Clinical guidelines recommend a **multidisciplinary approach**, combining pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments [^1174TuEt]. Regular monitoring and therapy adjustments based on patient response and side effects are essential [^113MphAd].

---

## Conclusion

Medications can alleviate the "tourniquet" sensation after thalamic stroke, but **relief is often partial and individualized**. **First-line options** include amitriptyline or nortriptyline and gabapentin or pregabalin [^114yY7hj] [^1174TuEt]; duloxetine or venlafaxine are alternatives if these are ineffective. **Second-line options** include lamotrigine, carbamazepine, or oxcarbazepine, and tramadol or tapentadol for severe cases [^115HwFeY] [^1174TuEt]. **If medications are inadequate**, consider rTMS, motor cortex stimulation, or deep brain stimulation [^113ad1jh] [^113ts3NB]. Combine pharmacotherapy with physical therapy and psychological support, and tailor treatment to response and side effects [^1174TuEt].

### Modulating the pain network — neurostimulation for central poststroke pain [^113ad1jh]. Nature Reviews Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

Central poststroke pain (CPSP) is one of the most under-recognized consequences of stroke, occurring in up to 10% of patients, and is also one of the most difficult to treat. The condition characteristically develops after selective lesions to the spinothalamic system, most often to the ventral posterior thalamus. Here, we suggest that CPSP is best characterized as a disorder of brain network reorganization, and that this characterization offers insight into the inadequacy of most pharmacological treatments. Accordingly, we review the progress in identification of nonpharmacological treatments, which could ultimately lead to mechanism-based therapeutics.

- **Invasive neurostimulation treatments**: Of these, electrical motor cortex stimulation seems to be superior to deep brain stimulation of the thalamus or brainstem. However, enthusiasm for the clinical use of the procedure is limited by its invasiveness.

- **Noninvasive treatments**: The preference is for transcranial magnetic stimulation, which, though effective, requires repeated application, causing logistical difficulties.

Although CPSP is often severe and remains difficult to treat, future characterization of the precise underlying neurophysiological mechanisms, together with technological innovation, should allow new treatments to evolve.

### Pharmacologic management part 2: Lesser-studied neuropathic pain diseases [^114yY7hj]. Pain Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

This second part of a review on the pharmacologic management of neuropathic pain diseases describes the treatment options for three lesser-studied neuropathic syndromes: central poststroke pain, spinal cord injury, and complex regional pain syndrome II. Diagnosis can be challenging in patients with these syndromes because the pain experienced is significantly more intense and of a different type than typically expected following a stroke or injury to the spinal cord or a peripheral nerve. Even when an accurate and timely diagnosis is made, treatment options are limited and often suboptimal. However, the results of published trials do support the use of anticonvulsants and/or tricyclic antidepressants as first-line pharmacotherapy in these three neuropathic pain syndromes.

To maximize treatment outcomes, future research must focus on:

- **Elucidating the relationship**: Continue to more fully elucidate the relationship between the signs and symptoms of pain and the underlying pathophysiology.
- **Delineating the natural history**: Delineate the natural history of central poststroke pain, spinal cord injury, and complex regional pain syndrome.
- **Identifying patient-related factors**: Identify patient-related factors that may indicate an increased risk of developing neuropathic pain following stroke or nerve injury.
- **Investigating emerging treatments**: Investigate emerging treatments that target underlying pain mechanisms.

### Evaluation and treatment of central pain syndromes [^115HwFeY]. Neurology (2004). Low credibility.

Central pain syndromes are a type of neuropathic pain associated with brain or spinal cord lesions following a stroke or other traumatic injury. Although spinal cord injury (SCI) pain and central post-stroke pain (CPSP) are both classified under central pain syndromes, they may originate from different causes. The pathophysiology of SCI pain and CPSP is not yet fully understood, but involvement of spinal and supraspinal pathways is possible. Pain arising from injuries to the central nervous system (CNS) may be vague or challenging to classify, with patients often describing sensations that are poorly localized and may change over time.

Pharmacologic interventions that have shown efficacy in managing central pain syndromes include intravenous lidocaine and opioids, as well as the tricyclic antidepressant amitriptyline and the antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) gabapentin and lamotrigine. Nonpharmacologic approaches have also benefited patients who do not respond to pharmacologic treatments. Further studies are necessary to evaluate the efficacy and safety of both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatments for central pain syndromes.

### Thalamic pain: Anatomical and physiological indices of prediction [^116q81rJ]. Brain (2016). Low credibility.

Thalamic pain is a severe and treatment-resistant type of central pain that may develop following a thalamic stroke. Lesions within the ventrocaudal regions of the thalamus carry the highest risk to develop pain, but its emergence in individual patients remains impossible to predict. Damage to the spino-thalamo-cortical system is a crucial factor in the development of central pain. In this study, we combined detailed anatomical atlas-based mapping of thalamic lesions and assessment of spinothalamic integrity using quantitative sensory analysis and laser-evoked potentials in 42 thalamic stroke patients, of whom 31 had developed thalamic pain.

More than 97% of lesions involved an area between 2 and 7 mm above the anterior-posterior commissural plane. Although most thalamic lesions affected several nuclei, patients with central pain showed maximal lesion convergence on the anterior pulvinar nucleus (a major spinothalamic target) while the convergence area lay within the ventral posterior lateral nucleus in pain-free patients. Both involvement of the anterior pulvinar nucleus and spinothalamic dysfunction (nociceptive thresholds, laser-evoked potentials) were significantly associated with the development of thalamic pain, whereas involvement of the ventral posterior lateral nucleus and lemniscal dysfunction (position sense, graphaesthesia, pallaesthesia, stereognosis, standard somatosensory potentials) were similarly distributed in patients with or without pain. A logistic regression model combining spinothalamic dysfunction and anterior pulvinar nucleus involvement as regressors.

### Thalamic cramplike pain [^111bULLL]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2014). Low credibility.

We describe a case of cramplike pain following a left thalamic ischemic stroke, a neglected type of central post-stroke pain, and we identify its neuroanatomical correlates.

- **Observations**: A 68-year-old right-handed man presented with right arm, leg, and flank cramplike pain noted upon awakening. Neurological examination was normal, with no evidence of objective sensory abnormalities. Because of the nature of the pain and the preserved sensory function, stroke was not initially considered as a potential cause. Instead, it was suspected that the pain was related to the combined effect of intense physical exercising on the right side and the use of statins. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging showed an acute ischemic infarction within the left thalamus. By registering high-resolution 3 T T1-weighted and T2-weighted magnetic resonance images to the Talairach atlas, we demonstrated that the infarction was within the border between the pulvinar and the ventral posterior medial nuclei. Brodmann's areas 3, 1, 2, 4, and 6 were identified as the cortical correlates of the ischemic lesion by diffusion tensor tractography.

- **Conclusions and relevance**: Thalamic cramplike pain should be recognized as a type of central post-stroke pain, likely produced by lesions localized to the border between the ventral posterior and pulvinar nuclei, and connected to the ipsilateral primary somatosensory cortex and primary and secondary motor cortices.

### Strategic infarcts of the thalamus in vascular dementia [^113FRJa6]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2002). Low credibility.

Strategic infarcts or focal hemorrhages involving the paramedian nuclei of the thalamus can alter consciousness and produce complex neuropsychological symptoms such as impairment of memory, attention, and motivation. Lesions that disrupt the thalamo-prefrontal circuits lead to severe subcortical dementia. We analyzed the clinical, neuropsychological, and neuroimaging data of 19 patients with cerebrovascular lesions in the thalamus. In six patients with bilateral paramedian infarcts and in two with anterior thalamic infarcts, vascular dementia and severe personality changes developed. Notably, SPECT findings did not correlate with the neuropsychological symptoms.

Transcortical sensory and motor aphasia was observed in four patients with thalamic hemorrhages and infarcts. In these patients, SPECT detected hypoperfusion in adjacent cortical areas. Detailed reports on the clinical symptoms and outcomes of four patients are provided. The clinico-morphological correlations of the thalamo-cortical circuits are reviewed, and the possible causes of multiple cognitive and behavioral consequences of vascular thalamic lesions are discussed.

### Can pure thalamic strokes lead to severe impairment of arousal [^112y9sEf]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

This study aimed to investigate the role of the thalamus in maintaining human consciousness by testing whether thalamic lesions alone are sufficient to cause severe impairment of arousal, as questioned by Hindman et al. Our results support their observations, demonstrating that thalamic strokes without extension into the brainstem are not sufficient to cause severe impairment of arousal. Our findings have implications for understanding the role of the thalamus in consciousness and provide valuable information for neurocritical care. Additionally, our results suggest critical involvement of upper brainstem regions, intersected by lesions leading to severe impairment of arousal but not by any of the control lesions, in maintaining arousal.

The thalamus has been thought to play an important role in human consciousness, acting as the main relay point between the brainstem and cortex. Thalamic infarcts may lead to disorders of consciousness, but coma or stupor seems to be relatively rare, and it has not been clear if thalamic lesions alone are sufficient to cause severe impairment of arousal. Together with previous findings, our results instead support a critical role for the brainstem reticular formation, including the pedunculopontine nucleus, ventral tegmental area, and likely most importantly, axons ascending through the central midbrain, for sustaining human wakefulness. This view is also supported by an earlier study investigating brainstem lesions, showing that injury to a small region in the pontine tegmentum is associated with coma.

### Thalamic warning syndrome and the artery of Percheron [^1171qQUj]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). Low credibility.

Stroke warning syndromes manifest as brief, recurring episodes of focal neurological deficits that precede definitive brain ischaemia. Although the mechanisms remain unclear, intermittent hypoperfusion in specific vascular territories may explain these phenomena. A man in his 60s with vascular risk factors experienced repeated episodes of sudden loss of consciousness. Initial imaging and tests were normal, excluding other potential causes. MRI revealed bilateral thalamic infarction and the presence of an artery of the Percheron variant. We propose 'thalamic warning syndrome' as a new term for this clinical presentation, characterized by transient loss of consciousness and a high risk of subsequent thalamic infarction. Early recognition of this syndrome can aid in the initial management and prognosis of similar cases, potentially preventing more severe neurological impairments.

### Neuropsychiatric manifestation following a stroke: Newly developed symptoms or side-effect of drug [^117B4eqn]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Low credibility.

A 55-year-old woman presented with sudden onset of left-sided body weakness and numbness, which was diagnosed as multifocal cerebral infarct with right thalamic bleed. She had a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and chronic kidney disease. She suffered from central poststroke pain and reactive depression as poststroke complications, for which amitriptyline was prescribed. Unfortunately, she developed symptoms suggestive of mania and psychosis upon initiation of medications, which resolved upon the withdrawal of amitriptyline. Amitriptyline is effective for the treatment of poststroke pain and is particularly useful in concomitant depression. Unexpectedly, this patient developed new psychopathologies after the initiation of this medication. This case highlights the development of new psychopathologies that could be due to the antidepressant, underlying bipolar disorder, or a complication of the stroke itself. Primary care providers need to actively enquire about neuropsychiatric symptoms because they can adversely affect the patient's quality of life as well as impede rehabilitation efforts.

### Factors behind poor cognitive outcome following a thalamic stroke [^114ZunA5]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

This study aimed to explore the neuropsychological outcomes of ischemic thalamic strokes, particularly focusing on factors influencing poor cognitive recovery. Our findings suggest that cognitive impairments following thalamic strokes might not be as uniform or as severe as previously thought. Our cluster analysis identified one subgroup of patients (Cluster 1) with no or minimal cognitive impairment, consistent with previous studies. This subgroup included all patients with right thalamic lesions and about half of those with left thalamic infarcts. This finding is notable as it suggests effective compensatory or neuroplastic mechanisms that may prevent significant functional deficits after isolated thalamic lesions.

The other subgroup of patients (Cluster 2) exhibited significant cognitive impairments across several domains, particularly in verbal memory, attention, and executive functions, and a higher apathy score. This subgroup mainly consisted of patients with left thalamic damage (49% of patients with a left infarct) and all patients with bilateral lesions. This aligns with previous studies indicating that left or bilateral thalamic strokes result in more severe cognitive deficits compared to right-sided lesions. A novel aspect of our study is the observation that, following a left thalamic infarct, approximately half of the patients recover well, while the other half show significant cognitive deficits.

### Cheiro-oral syndrome secondary to thalamic infarction: A clinical syndrome a physician should know [^116J1SGJ]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

The thalamus is a vital relay centre in the brain. Nearly all pathways projecting to the cortex pass through the thalamus. With a total of seven relay nuclei, the ventral posterior medial (VPM) and the ventral posterior lateral (VPL) thalamic nuclei are especially relevant in the pathogenesis of cheiro-oral syndrome. The VPM receives sensory input from the trigeminal nerve, whereas the VPL nuclei receive sensory input from the upper limbs. Due to their proximity, structural lesions such as an infarct can result in the pattern of sensory deficits characteristic of the syndrome, as demonstrated by our patient.

The clinical significance of cheiro-oral syndrome cannot be understated. Prompt recognition allows for early identification and treatment of ischaemic strokes. Conversely, failure to do so has detrimental implications, resulting in delaying targeted stroke treatment, and places the patient at increased risk of stroke recurrences and its inherent morbidity and mortality. Through the case described herein, we therefore seek to highlight the importance of recognising this uncommon stroke syndrome, so that timely treatment may be administered.

- **Learning points**: Cheiro-oral syndrome, though rare, has significant localising value. Cheiro-oral syndrome can be caused by ischaemic strokes, and should not be missed.

### Analgesia in conjunction with normalisation of thermal sensation following deep brain stimulation for central post-stroke pain [^116be3ZG]. Pain (2009). Low credibility.

We have presented a patient with a severe, refractory central pain syndrome following a temporo-parietal infarct, manifesting as hemi-body pain with cold dysaesthesia and marked tactile allodynia. This was associated with thermal hypoaesthesia and hypoalgesia, along with decreased punctate tactile sensation. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the periventricular gray produced a striking analgesic effect with reduced allodynia that was associated with the resolution of the hemi-body hypoaesthesia and hypoalgesia. Unfortunately, this improvement lasted less than nine months. As his pain returned, his sensory loss also recurred. This is the first report of therapeutic restoration of sensory function associated with an improvement in central post-stroke pain (CPSP) symptoms.

Head and Holmes suggested that central pain was caused by the loss of specific pain and temperature pathways due to damage to the lateral thalamus, which disinhibits the medial thalamic nucleus. This hypothesis has been reformulated to postulate that the loss of input in the neo-spinothalamic tract removes the sensory-discriminative aspects of pain input, leaving the phylogenetically older medial pain pathways intact and without their usual regulation.

### Frequency, clinical presentation and outcome of vigilance impairment in patients with uni- and bilateral ischemic infarction of the paramedian thalamus [^114AtoV8]. Journal of Neurology (2021). High credibility.

Ischemic stroke of the paramedian thalamus is a rare differential diagnosis in sudden altered vigilance states. While efforts to describe clinical symptomatology exist, data on the frequency of paramedian thalamic stroke as a cause of sudden impaired vigilance and on accompanying clinical signs and outcome are scarce. We retrospectively analyzed consecutive patients admitted to a tertiary stroke center between 2010 and 2019 diagnosed with paramedian thalamic stroke. We evaluated the frequency of vigilance impairment (VI) due to paramedian thalamic stroke, accompanying clinical signs, and short-term outcome in uni- versus bilateral paramedian lesion location.

Of 3,896 ischemic stroke patients, 53 showed a paramedian thalamic stroke location (1.4%). VI was seen in 29 out of 53 patients with paramedian thalamic stroke and in 414 out of 3,896 with any stroke (10.6%). Paramedian thalamic stroke was identified as causal to VI in 3.4% of all patients with initial VI in the emergency department and in 0.7% of all ischemic stroke patients treated in our center.

Accompanying clinical signs were detected in 21 of these 29 patients (72.4%) and facilitated a timely diagnosis. VI was significantly more common after bilateral than unilateral lesions (92.0% vs. 21.4%; p < 0.001). Patients with bilateral paramedian lesions were more severely affected, had longer hospital stays, and more frequently required in-patient rehabilitation. Paramedian thalamic lesions account for about 1 in 15 stroke patients presenting with impaired vigilance. Bilateral paramedian lesion location is associated with worse stroke severity.

### Fluctuating drowsiness following cardiac catheterisation: artery of Percheron ischaemic stroke causing bilateral thalamic infarcts [^113fdHai]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

An 81-year-old man underwent cardiac catheterisation to investigate breathlessness and left ventricular impairment of unknown cause. He had unobstructed coronary arteries. Immediately following the procedure, he became suddenly unresponsive with vertical gaze palsy, anisocoria, and bilateral upgoing plantar responses. He made a rapid recovery to his premorbid state 25 minutes later with no residual focal neurological signs. He then experienced multiple unresponsive episodes, interspersed with complete resolution of symptoms and neurological signs.

MRI of the brain identified bilateral medial thalamic infarcts and midbrain infarcts, consistent with an artery of Percheron territory infarction. By the time the diagnosis was reached, the thrombolysis window had elapsed. The unresponsive episodes diminished with time, and the patient was discharged to inpatient rehabilitation. At a 6-month review after the episode, the patient exhibited a degree of progressive cognitive impairment.

### Evolution of neuropsychological deficits in first-ever isolated ischemic thalamic stroke and their association with stroke topography: A case-control study [^115DJ7uA]. Stroke (2022). Low credibility.

Previous studies in paramedian stroke patients yielded mixed results. Some studies, contrary to our study, specifically observed memory deficits, whereas other studies, like ours, showed a broader range of cognitive deficits. Some studies analyzed cognitive deficits during the first days poststroke, while other studies analyzed cognitive deficits in the chronic phase, 1 to 5 years poststroke. Previous studies revealing memory deficits included a higher number of bilateral paramedian strokes, while our sample only included one patient with bilateral paramedian stroke.

Similar to our study, a previous study analyzing 19 mostly chronic thalamic stroke patients (0.25–120 months poststroke) by subtraction analysis showed that in eight patients with executive deficits, mainly an area in the left medial thalamus consisting of the centromedian and parafascicular nuclei was damaged. Using VLSM, we identified regions at the border between the left anterior, paramedian, and inferolateral thalamus that predicted non-verbal memory, language, and executive impairment. Due to defined time points and the larger sample size, our study was better powered to identify associations between neuropsychological deficits and stroke topography.

Interestingly, the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus was not associated with memory or executive deficits in our study. The mediodorsal thalamic nucleus seems to play a multifaceted role in higher cognitive functions and mediate cortical network regulation.

### Can pure thalamic strokes lead to severe impairment of arousal [^113UA2En]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

There are some limitations to acknowledge. First, despite including all cases from a university hospital over a 15-year period, we only identified four cases with severe, long-term impairment of arousal following strokes involving the thalamus. This number matches the patients in the earlier study. Thus, the localization to the brainstem should be interpreted with caution. However, this localization is supported by the fact that these regions were not intersected by any of the lesions in the patients of the two control cohorts. Second, we did not exclude patients with prior strokes, and it is possible that damage to the identified brainstem regions alone may not be sufficient to cause severe impairment of arousal. Finally, it should be acknowledged that our study focused on the state of consciousness (arousal) and not the content of consciousness (awareness), where the thalamus may still have an important role.

In conclusion, our results support the findings by Hindman et al, demonstrating that thalamic damage alone is not sufficient to cause severe impairment of arousal. This finding has clinical implications, supporting active clinical investigations for an alternative cause in patients with coma or stupor following thalamic strokes not extending into the brainstem.

### Paradoxical heat sensation as a manifestation of thermal hypesthesia: a study of 1090 patients with lesions of the somatosensory system [^111hfVtd]. Pain (2024). Low credibility.

- **Materials and methods**: The study was approved by the local ethics committees at each participating centre. All patients provided written informed consent for their data to be collected and analyzed in the database. All procedures were conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.

- **Study design**: All patients were tested in a single setting using the QST protocol of the German Research Network on Neuropathic Pain (DFNS), during which the presence or absence of paradoxical heat sensation was recorded. Patients filled in the questionnaire before assessment. Fifteen pain facilities across Europe participated in gathering data within three consortia: German Research Network on Neuropathic Pain (DFNS), IMI (Innovative Medicines Initiative) EUROPAIN, and NEUROPAIN. All centres underwent a strict quality assessment. Data were collected in a central database in Bochum, Germany. An analysis of heterogeneity between the participating centres showed a high degree of homogeneity, making it possible to analyze the database as a homogenous group. Subsets of this database, as well as inclusion and exclusion criteria, have been published previously.

- **Inclusion or exclusion criteria**: We included patients with confirmed peripheral neuropathic pain due to polyneuropathy or unilateral peripheral lesions (including peripheral nerve injury, postherpetic neuralgia, or radiculopathy); patients with central neuropathic pain due to spinal cord injury, syringomyelia, or stroke; and patients with similar conditions.

### Inferolateral thalamic ischemia secondary to PCA P2 perforator occlusion mimics MCA stroke syndrome [^115qWyJf]. Neurosurgical Review (2020). Low credibility.

Paramedian thalamic strokes following occlusion of the posterior medial (paramedian) thalamic perforators have been previously described in great detail. However, the stroke syndrome associated with occlusion of posterior lateral (inferolateral) thalamic perforators is less commonly known. We present an illustrative case of an inferolateral thalamic perforator stroke mimicking a middle cerebral artery (MCA) syndrome and provide a review of the literature.

A 62-year-old male presented with dysarthria, contralateral hemisensory loss, and contralateral weakness, concerning for possible MCA stroke. However, close examination revealed the hemiparesis to be ataxic in nature. Imaging revealed a left PCA P2 segment occlusion and lacunar infarction of the ventral lateral (VL) and ventral posterior (VP) thalamus, the main thalamic destination of cerebellar and sensory pathways.

This case is unique because the P1 segment and posterior communicating artery (Pcom) remained patent, resulting in selective occlusion of only the posterior lateral (inferolateral) thalamic perforators at the P2 level. Acute loss of the posterior lateral (inferolateral) thalamic perforators at the proximal P2 segment results in a ventral lateral and ventral posterior thalamic stroke characterized by contralateral hemisensory loss, contralateral ataxic hemiparesis, and dysarthria.

It is important to recognize the inferolateral thalamic stroke syndrome, as it may be mistaken clinically for an MCA occlusion. The benefit of mechanical thrombectomy for this type of stroke is not well established and should be considered.

### Hemidystonia secondary to thalamic hemorrhage treated with GPi stimulation [^116LjciD]. Movement Disorders (2008). Low credibility.

There have been few reports on the surgical treatment of secondary hemidystonias, most of which are due to basal ganglia stroke or trauma. We present two patients with hemidystonia secondary to thalamic hemorrhage whom we successfully treated with unilateral globus pallidus internus (GPi) stimulation.

- **Case 1**: A 56-year-old man with abnormal posturing and intolerable muscle contraction pain in the left arm.

- **Case 2**: A 73-year-old woman who developed severe abnormal posturing in the right arm and gait disturbance due to hyperextension of the right leg.

The dystonic symptoms of both patients were refractory to medication. Three months after the inception of high-frequency GPi stimulation, the motor scores on the Burke-Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale improved by 49.2% and 34.3% in Cases 1 and 2, respectively. We suggest GPi stimulation as a possible alternative to treat secondary hemidystonia.

### Decreased consciousness: Bilateral thalamic infarction and its relation to the artery of Percheron [^111Npom9]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Low credibility.

This case series highlights two patients seen in the same stroke center presenting with unusual symptoms. They were later diagnosed with bilateral thalamic infarcts, probably related to an unusual anatomical variant. The difficulties in establishing the diagnoses, due to their relative rarity and complexity, could have impacted patient outcomes.

### Long-term functional outcome in patients with isolated thalamic stroke: The KOSCO study [^114oF4LC]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Low credibility.

The Euro Quality of Life 5-Dimension presentation demonstrated that pain and discomfort were the most frequently reported problems in patients with thalamic stroke at 24 months after stroke onset. Although these data were not statistically analyzed, these findings are consistent with well-known sensory discomfort reported in patients with thalamic stroke. Furthermore, for patients who reported dependency, mobility and usual activities were found to be the next most frequent problems. These findings imply that motor function is an important concern for disability in patients with isolated thalamic stroke. However, for patients with isolated stroke (IS) who were independent at 24 months after stroke onset, their second problem was anxiety and depression. These results suggest that sensory and emotional problems should be the focus in patients with thalamic IS without disabilities.

Several previous studies in patients with stroke reported that age, initial stroke severity, duration of hospitalization, functional level at discharge, and comorbidities were commonly associated with dependency after stroke. In this study, age and FMA score were identified as significant factors associated with disability at 24 months after isolated thalamic stroke. Therefore, it is important to properly assess and manage motor function in patients with thalamic stroke to achieve favorable outcomes.

The strength of this study is that it was a large, multicentered study assessing the functional outcomes of various physical domains in patients with isolated thalamic stroke.

### Reversal of thalamic hand syndrome by long-term motor cortex stimulation [^113ts3NB]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2000). Low credibility.

The authors describe a case of complete recovery from the so-called "thalamic hand" syndrome following chronic motor cortex stimulation in a 64-year-old man suffering from post-stroke thalamic central pain. As of the 2-year follow-up examination, the patient's dystonia and pain are still controlled by electrical stimulation. It is speculated that a common mechanism, in which the thalamocortical circuit loops are rendered out of balance, may sustain hand dystonia and central pain in this case of thalamic syndrome. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first reported case of its kind.

### Factors behind poor cognitive outcome following a thalamic stroke [^114GZo3K]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

Thalamic strokes produce neurological, cognitive, and behavioral symptoms depending on the thalamic nuclei involved. While traditionally associated with severe cognitive deficits, recent studies suggest more modest impairments. This study aims to identify the factors that influence the severity of cognitive impairment following thalamic stroke.

- **Methods**: We recruited 40 patients (mean age 51.1) with chronic isolated thalamic stroke and 45 healthy subjects (mean age 48.5) who underwent neuroimaging and neuropsychological assessment. Cluster and principal component analyses were used to discriminate patients from healthy subjects based on cognitive tasks. Disconnectome maps and cortical thickness were analyzed to understand the distant impact of thalamic strokes.

- **Results**: Two cognitive profiles emerged from the cluster analysis. Cluster 1 included mostly healthy subjects (n = 43) and patients with no or minor deficits (n = 20). Cluster 2 included patients (n = 19) and two healthy subjects with severe deficits in verbal memory, executive functions, and attention. Cluster 1 encompassed all patients with right thalamic stroke, while Cluster 2 included all patients with bilateral stroke or mammillothalamic tract interruption. Patients with left-sided stroke were equally divided between clusters. Significant differences between clusters included age, education, interthalamic adhesion disruption, lesion volume, and location. Patients with left-sided stroke in Cluster 2 had more lateral thalamic lesions and greater disruption of the anterior thalamic projection.

### Central post-stroke pain: Clinical characteristics, pathophysiology, and management [^1174TuEt]. The Lancet Neurology (2009). Low credibility.

Central post-stroke pain (CPSP) is a neuropathic pain syndrome that can occur following a cerebrovascular accident. This syndrome is characterized by pain and sensory abnormalities in the body parts that correspond to the brain territory injured by the cerebrovascular lesion. The presence of sensory loss and signs of hypersensitivity in the painful area in patients with CPSP might indicate the dual combination of deafferentation and subsequent development of neuronal hyperexcitability. The exact prevalence of CPSP is not known, partly due to the difficulty in distinguishing this syndrome from other pain types that can occur after stroke, such as shoulder pain, painful spasticity, persistent headache, and other musculoskeletal pain conditions. Future prospective studies with clear diagnostic criteria are essential for the proper collection and processing of epidemiological data. Although treatment of CPSP is difficult, the most effective approaches are those that target increased neuronal hyperexcitability.

### Feeling sounds following a thalamic lesion [^115fiJ3T]. Annals of Neurology (2007). Low credibility.

The ventrolateral nucleus of the thalamus (VL), based on its connectivity with the cerebellum and motor cortex, has long been considered to be involved with motor functions. We show that the human VL also plays a prominent role in sensory processing.

- **Methods**: Structural magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion tensor imaging were used to localize a small lesion restricted to the right VL in a patient with contralesional sensory processing deficits. Systematic assessments of anatomic brain organization and behavioral measurements of somatosensory and visual processing were conducted at several time points after stroke.

- **Results**: Initially, the patient was more likely to detect events on the contralesional side when a simultaneous ipsilesional event was presented within the same, but not different, sensory modality. This perceptual phenomenon, which we refer to as unisensory antiextinction, persisted for several months before transforming into a form of synesthesia in which auditory stimuli produced tactile percepts. Tractography performed on the diffusion tensor imaging data showed altered connections from the lesioned thalamus to the cerebral cortex, suggesting a neural basis for these sensory changes.

- **Interpretation**: These results demonstrate a role for the VL in sensory processing and suggest that reorganization of thalamocortical axonal connectivity can lead to major changes in perception.

### Approach to diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of generalized and nonlocal dysesthesia: A review [^111hJdVC]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2023). High credibility.

Among other possible causes, dysesthesia can be caused by:

- **Neurological and systemic conditions**: Thalamic syndrome, polyneuropathy, Guillain-Barré syndrome, peripheral sensory neuropathy, multiple sclerosis, diabetic neuropathy, complex regional pain syndrome, spinal cord injury, stroke, transverse myelitis
- **Infectious and disease-related causes**: Lyme disease, herpes zoster, amyloidosis, HIV infection
- **Metabolic and nutritional deficiencies**: Vitamin B12 deficiency, hypothyroidism
- **Substance-related causes**: Alcohol withdrawal syndrome, chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy

In addition, dysesthesia can be caused by medications such as:

- **Cancer therapies**: Oxaliplatin, crizotinib, entrectinib, ceritinib, cobimetinib, ifosfamide, cyclophosphamide, docetaxel, copanlisib
- **Antibiotics and antivirals**: Levofloxacin, ganciclovir, ciprofloxacin ER, ciprofloxacin, maraviroc
- **Pain and anesthesia-related treatments**: Lidocaine hydrochloride, frovatriptan, capsaicin
- **Cardiovascular agents**: Enalapril, enalaprilat
- **Miscellaneous medications**: Azelastine, letrozole, fluvastatin, amphotericin B liposomal, fluvastatin ER, palifermin

### Gamma knife surgery targeting the centromedian nucleus of the thalamus for the palliative management of thalamic pain: Durable response in stroke-induced thalamic pain syndrome [^114vmF4J]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2006). High credibility.

The authors report the neuroimaging features, treatment planning, and outcome in a case of radiosurgical thalamotomy targeting the centromedian nucleus (CMN) for stroke-induced thalamic pain. A 79-year-old man, with embolic occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery and large hemispheric infarction involving the thalamus, suffered a right hemiplegia and expressive aphasia. One year post-stroke, severe right-sided facial, scalp, arm, and trunk pain developed and was exacerbated by any tactile contact. Medical treatment had failed. Medical illness, including mandatory anticoagulation therapy for atrial fibrillation, precluded surgical procedures. Minimally invasive radiosurgery was offered as an alternative.

Magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography were used to localize the left CMN. A single shot of 140 Gy was delivered to the 100% isodose line using the 4-mm collimator helmet. The patient was evaluated at regular intervals. By 12 weeks post-treatment, he had significant improvements in pain control and his ability to tolerate physical contact during activities of daily living. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated baseline encephalomalacia from his prior stroke and signal changes in the left CMN consistent with gamma irradiation-based thalamotomy.

Currently, nearly 7 years after radiosurgery, he continues to enjoy a marked reduction in pain without the need for analgesic medications. Thalamic pain syndrome is generally refractory to conventional treatment. Neurosurgical interventions provide modest benefit and carry associated risks of invasive surgery.

### Evolution of neuropsychological deficits in first-ever isolated ischemic thalamic stroke and their association with stroke topography: A case-control study [^113jLWRk]. Stroke (2022). Low credibility.

Neuropsychological assessment was not systematically conducted upon admission due to vigilance disturbances, sleepiness, and behavioral abnormalities, including restlessness in the acute stroke phase. Instead, the first examination occurred after 1 month. A graphical longitudinal overview of neuropsychological performance for the cognitive domains from 1 month to 24 months post-stroke is presented in Figure 1; the detailed time course for the cognitive domains is given in Table 2. T scores and raw scores of individual neuropsychological tests are shown respectively.

- **T scores of cognitive domains**: The table includes data for patients with thalamic stroke and their matched controls.

Figure 1 illustrates T scores of different cognitive domains for all strokes, as well as strokes split by vascular territory, at 1, 6, 12, and 24 months post-stroke. Cognitive data are represented by the median (solid line) ± interquartile ranges (shaded areas). Lesion overlay maps are shown on the left side; for further details, see Figure 2. Single infarcts were located outside this plane.

- **Verbal memory**: Patients with anterior thalamic stroke exhibited particularly severe verbal memory deficits at 1 month compared to their matched controls. These deficits slightly improved during follow-up. Patients with paramedian thalamic stroke did not show significant deficits in verbal memory compared to their matched controls and performed significantly better than those with anterior thalamic stroke. Inferolateral thalamic stroke patients had significant verbal memory deficits at 1 month compared with their matched controls.

### Intracortical inhibition is reduced in a patient with a lesion in the posterolateral thalamus [^111w73hK]. Movement Disorders (2002). Low credibility.

We describe a patient who developed a complex movement disorder following an ischemic lesion in the right posterolateral thalamus. Transcranial magnetic stimulation demonstrated a shortening of the cortical silent period and deficient cortico-cortical inhibition using paired magnetic pulses on the affected side, indicating reduced effectiveness of intracortical inhibitory mechanisms.

### Trigeminal neuralgia [^117B1nY4]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2009). Low credibility.

Trigeminal neuralgia is characterized by sudden, unilateral, brief, stabbing pain in the distribution of one or more branches of the fifth cranial nerve. Pain occurs in paroxysms lasting from a few seconds to 2 minutes, with frequency ranging from a few to hundreds of attacks per day. Periods of remission can last for months to years but tend to shorten over time.

- **Methods and outcomes**: We conducted a systematic review to answer the clinical question: What are the effects of treatments in people with trigeminal neuralgia? We searched Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other relevant databases up to September 2007. (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review.) We included harm alerts from organizations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

- **Results**: We found 14 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We conducted a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

- **Conclusions**: In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions:
	- **Medications**: baclofen, carbamazepine, clonazepam, gabapentin, lamotrigine, oxcarbazepine, phenytoin, sodium valproate
	- **Surgical procedures**: ablative neurosurgical techniques to the Gasserian ganglion, microvascular decompression, stereotactic procedures
	- **Peripheral treatments**: cryotherapy of peripheral nerves, nerve block, peripheral acupuncture
	- **Other treatments**: proparacaine eye drops

### How central is central poststroke pain? The role of afferent input in poststroke neuropathic pain: A prospective, open-label pilot study [^116FyJ5u]. Pain (2018). Low credibility.

Central poststroke pain (CPSP) is a neuropathic pain disorder whose underlying mechanisms are not well understood. It has been suggested that stroke-associated loss of inhibitory neurons in the spinothalamic tract causes disinhibition of thalamic neurons, which autonomously generate ectopic nociceptive action potentials responsible for the pain experience. We hypothesized that CPSP results from misinterpretation of afferent sensory input by the sensitized neurons within the brain, rather than being spontaneously generated by the damaged central nervous system (CNS) neurons.

To test this hypothesis, we prospectively recruited eight patients with definite CPSP affecting at least one extremity. In an open-label intervention, an ultrasound-guided peripheral nerve block with lidocaine was performed to block afferent sensory input from a painful extremity. Spontaneous and evoked pain, neuropathic pain descriptors, and lidocaine plasma concentrations were measured. The blockade of peripheral sensory input resulted in complete abolition of pain in seven of the eight subjects within 30 minutes (the primary outcome measure of the study), and more than 50% pain relief in the remaining participant. Median (interquartile range) spontaneous pain intensity changed from 6.5 (4.3–7.0) at baseline to 0 (0–0) after the block (P = 0.008). All mechanical and thermal hypersensitivity was abolished by the nerve block.

The results suggest that it is unlikely that CPSP is autonomously generated within the CNS. Rather, this pain is dependent on afferent input from the painful region in the periphery.

### Reorganization of somatic sensory function in the human thalamus after stroke [^112Q8Egt]. Annals of Neurology (2001). Low credibility.

A patient with thalamic stroke underwent microelectrode-guided stereotactic thalamic exploration during surgery for control of tremor. The results of somatic sensory mapping in this patient were compared with explorations carried out during stereotactic surgery for the control of essential tremor (70 patients). There was evidence of both somatotopic reorganization and anatomic reorganization of the representation of deep structures in the principal somatic sensory nucleus of the thalamus and the nuclei located anterior to it. This case demonstrates that thalamic reorganization can occur following a thalamic stroke and may play a role in recovery from such a stroke.

### Analgesic and placebo effects of thalamic stimulation [^1169eBRu]. Pain (2003). Low credibility.

Numerous clinical studies have reported successful relief of chronic pain with sensory thalamic stimulation. However, even with the extensive use of sensory thalamic stimulation as a clinical tool for the relief of chronic pain, the results remain inconsistent. This discrepancy could likely be explained by the fact that the majority of these studies are case reports or retrospective analyses, which have often used imprecise pain measurements, preventing rigorous statistical evaluation of pain relief. None of these studies measured the effect of stimulation on clinical pain for longer than a few hours per day, an important consideration since clinical pain can vary over time.

Moreover, placebo controls are seldom included. In the study, we measured patients' pain perception at home over a 2-week period, during both days of normal sensory thalamus stimulation and days without stimulation. Patients also visited the laboratory to assess the effects of thalamic and placebo stimulation on clinical pain, experimental heat pain, innocuous air puff, and visual stimulation. A potential relationship between perceived paresthesia and analgesic efficacy during thalamic and placebo stimulation was also explored. We found that thalamic stimulation significantly affected clinical and experimental pain perception, but an important placebo component also exists. On the other hand, neither thalamic nor placebo stimulation affected air puff and visual ratings, suggesting that the effect applies specifically to pain and hence is not caused by non-painful stimuli.

### Factors behind poor cognitive outcome following a thalamic stroke [^117D251R]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

To conclude, our findings particularly challenge the uniformity and severity of cognitive impairments traditionally associated with thalamic lesions by demonstrating that most patients had no or minor cognitive deficits. Our analysis also revealed the heterogeneity in cognitive outcomes depending on the lesion's laterality and the specific thalamic territories impacted. Notably, lesions within the left thalamus and those affecting the mamillothalamic tract significantly correlate with more profound cognitive deficits, particularly in verbal memory, attention, and executive functions. In addition, our connectome analysis points to effects far beyond the thalamus proper of thalamic strokes. These results suggest that we should adopt a more holistic understanding of the thalamus when considering its integral role in the broader neural network governing cognitive functions.

### Directional sensory thalamus deep brain stimulation in poststroke refractory pain [^115a5V8T]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

Thalamic deep brain stimulation (DBS) for chronic pain is performed in selected patients with a variable success rate. We report the use of recently developed directional DBS in a patient with hemibody central poststroke pain (CPSP) and its added value in the induction of pleasant, pain-distracting paresthesias throughout the contralateral body side. A 68-year-old man suffered from multiple strokes in the left hemisphere 11 years before presentation, resulting in medically refractory right-sided hemibody CPSP. He was implanted with a directional DBS electrode in the left ventrocaudal nucleus of the thalamus. A directional single-segment contact configuration produced better improvement throughout the contralateral body side than ring-mode and other directional configurations. Treatment led to a reduction of almost 50% in pain. This case demonstrates the value of directional DBS in the treatment of chronic pain, as steering increases selectivity and reduces side effects in a small target area surrounded by structures with high functional diversity.

### Permanent reversal of essential tremor following a frontal lobe stroke [^114VxbSz]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2015). Low credibility.

Following a right prerolandic stroke, a 76-year-old woman with bilateral upper extremity essential tremor (ET) recovered permanently from the tremor contralaterally to the affected hemisphere. The ischemic stroke likely interrupted the cortical component of the ET network. Given the magnitude of neuronal loss, post-stroke cortical reorganization was unable to restore this important component of the ET network, accounting for the permanent nature of ET suppression.

### Pure sensory stroke due to brainstem lesion [^116sKWwv]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). Low credibility.

Pure sensory stroke (PSS) is a lacunar syndrome affecting various areas of the somatosensory system. PSS is defined as a specific type of stroke displaying prominent hemisensory symptoms without other major neurological deficits. While thalamic stroke remains the most common cause of PSS, it can also manifest secondary to small non-thalamic lesions involving the cerebral cortex, internal capsule, or brainstem.

Unfortunately, brainstem lesions remain difficult to identify due to their relatively small size and may take days to weeks before changes are evident on imaging studies. Brainstem pure or predominant sensory strokes are usually caused by a paramedian dorsal pontine lesion involving the medial lemniscus tract and can present with mild transient non-sensory symptoms, most commonly dizziness and gait ataxia. Acute ocular pain has also been implicated in impending brainstem ischaemia.

This case report highlights a pure sensory brainstem stroke with subtle clinical features that help to localise its origin within the brain. It stresses the importance of performing an accurate history and thorough clinical exam while maintaining a high index of suspicion for brainstem lesions.

### Allodynia in patients with post-stroke central pain (CPSP) studied by statistical quantitative sensory testing within individuals [^115SMkp3]. Pain (2004). Low credibility.

The disinhibition hypothesis of post-stroke central pain (CPSP) suggests that 'the excessive response (dysesthesia/hyperalgesia/allodynia) is accompanied by a loss of sensation', resulting from a lesion of a 'lateral nucleus' of the thalamus or of 'cortico-thalamic paths' [Brain 34 (1911) 102]. One recent elaboration of this hypothesis proposes a submodality-specific relationship, such that injury to a cool-signaling lateral thalamic pathway disinhibits a nociceptive medial thalamic pathway. This disinhibition produces both burning, cold, ongoing pain and cold allodynia.

The study quantitatively evaluated the sensory loss and sensory abnormalities to discern submodality relationships between these sensory features of CPSP. The present results were statistically tested within individuals, allowing sensory loss and sensory abnormality to be directly related by their concurrent occurrence in the same individual. The results demonstrate that individuals with CPSP and normal tactile detection thresholds experience tactile allodynia significantly more often than those with tactile hypoesthesia. Most patients (11/13) exhibited hypoesthesia for the perception of cool stimuli, although few of these (2/11) showed cold allodynia. The most dramatic case of cold allodynia occurred in a patient who had a normal detection threshold for cold.

Individuals with cold hypoesthesia, strictly contralateral to the cerebrovascular accident (CVA or stroke), were often characterized by the presence of burning, cold, ongoing pain, and by the absence, not the presence, of cold allodynia. Overall, these results in CPSP suggest a…

### Assessing the risk of central post-stroke pain of thalamic origin by lesion mapping [^112zwoic]. Brain (2012). Low credibility.

Central post-stroke pain of thalamic origin is an extremely distressing and often refractory disorder. There are no well-established predictors for pain development after thalamic stroke, and the role of different thalamic nuclei is unclear. Here, we used structural magnetic resonance imaging to identify the thalamic nuclei specifically implicated in the generation of central post-stroke pain of thalamic origin. Lesions of 10 patients with central post-stroke pain of thalamic origin and 10 control patients with thalamic strokes without pain were identified as volumes of interest on magnetic resonance imaging data. Non-linear deformations were estimated to match each image with a high-resolution template and were applied to each volume of interest. By using a digital atlas of the thalamus, we elucidated the involvement of different nuclei concerning each lesion.

Patient and control volumes of interest were summed separately to identify unique areas of involvement. Voxelwise odds ratio maps were calculated to localize the anatomical site where lesions put patients at risk of developing central post-stroke pain of thalamic origin. In the patients with pain, mainly lateral and posterior thalamic nuclei were affected, whereas a more anterior-medial lesion pattern was evident in the controls. The lesions of 9 of 10 pain patients overlapped at the border of the ventral posterior nucleus and the pulvinar, coinciding with the ventrocaudalis portae nucleus. The lesions of this area showed an odds ratio of 81 in favor of developing thalamic pain.

### Long-term functional outcome in patients with isolated thalamic stroke: The KOSCO study [^114Sq6Hm]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). High credibility.

Although age-adjusted incidence and mortality rates have been decreasing in past decades, stroke remains the third leading cause of death and disability. Moreover, as more patients survive with disabilities after stroke, the global burden of stroke has been increasing. Therefore, it is important to accurately understand the long-term disability and functional outcomes of stroke to establish appropriate management and coping strategies.

Overall stroke mortality, disease progress, and long-term functional outcomes are relatively well known from previous studies. However, studies on stroke outcomes according to specific locations are lacking. Given that the symptoms of stroke can vary significantly depending on the precise location of the brain lesion, a comprehensive understanding of outcomes for specific stroke types is imperative for their effective management. Notably, there are few studies on isolated thalamic stroke.

The thalamus is a complex brain structure containing several nuclei that are associated with various functions, and thalamic stroke generally presents with symptoms such as motor weakness, sensory disturbances, cognitive defects, or language deficits based on specific thalamic vascular lesions. Despite these previous reports, the exact physical impairments after thalamic stroke, both ischemic stroke (IS) and hemorrhagic stroke (HS), and long-term functional prognosis are not well recognized. Providing precise information regarding the functional outcomes of isolated thalamic stroke could lead to enhancements in effective management.

### Trigeminal neuralgia [^1138rwFB]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2014). Low credibility.

Trigeminal neuralgia is a sudden, unilateral, brief, stabbing pain in the distribution of one or more branches of the fifth cranial nerve. The pain occurs in paroxysms, which can last from a few seconds to several minutes. The frequency of these paroxysms ranges from a few to hundreds of attacks per day. Periods of remission can last for months to years but tend to shorten over time. The condition can impair activities of daily living and potentially lead to depression.

- **Methods and outcomes**: We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of ongoing treatments in people with trigeminal neuralgia? We searched Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to September 2013. Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review. We included harms alerts from relevant organizations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

- **Results**: We found seven studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

- **Conclusions**: In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: baclofen, carbamazepine, gabapentin, lamotrigine, oxcarbazepine, microvascular decompression, and destructive neurosurgical techniques (including radiofrequency thermocoagulation, glycerol rhizolysis, balloon compression, and stereotactic radiosurgery).

### The role of tourniquet placement in management of a patient with status epilepticus [^115LUvj6]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

The global burden of seizure disorders highlights the necessity for effective management of patients with status epilepticus (SE). The universally accepted goal of management is the prompt mitigation of seizure activity with appropriate supportive care. During management, intubation may be required. In the process of endotracheal tube placement, patients are administered neuromuscular blockers and general anesthesia. Paralytic activity on the neuromuscular junction hinders the emergency physician's ability to effectively observe seizure activity. Moreover, this makes it difficult to discern patient sedation levels for titration. Effective tourniquet placement may separate a region of the body from general circulation, rendering distal tissues unaffected by the neuromuscular blockade.

- **Case report**: A 73-year-old white woman presented to the emergency department with a stroke, and her condition generalized into diffuse tonic-clonic seizures. Concern for airway integrity warranted intubation with appropriate induction of paralysis and sedation. A tourniquet was placed proximal to the right knee and tightened until a dorsalis pedis pulse was no longer palpable. Computed tomography and computed tomography angiography of the head revealed no cerebrovascular event. After imaging, purposeful movements were noted in the right lower extremity distal to the tourniquet despite the initiation of a standard dose post-intubation sedation with fentanyl (0.5 μg/kg/h) and propofol (20 μg/kg/min). No tonic-clonic activity was observed. With necessary up-titration, movement in the right lower extremity continued to provide valuable feedback for monitoring patient status.

### Involvement of thalamocortical networks in patients with poststroke thalamic aphasia [^113dEmVY]. Neurology (2023). Low credibility.

The assessment of stroke symptoms of interest was based on a retrospective review of the complete medical report of all patients who met the inclusion criteria. For this purpose, all documented deficits related to the acute or subacute event were reviewed in detail. As part of stroke routine care, patients are examined repeatedly by treating physicians within the first 72 hours of hospital admission. Additionally, all patients are evaluated by a trained speech and language therapist, physiotherapist, and occupational therapist at least once within the first 24 hours, resulting in a relatively reliable screening for and complete record of stroke symptoms. Because of the sometimes mild and transient symptoms in thalamic stroke, a symptom was considered present if documented at least once during the initial neurologic examination in the emergency department, repeated medical visits, or therapy sessions.

No quantitative language tests were performed as part of the routine examination, but a standardized instrument (Aphasia Check List) was applied by speech and language therapists if aphasia was suspected. We interpreted the presence of language impairments based on the documentation of reduced fluency, spontaneous speech or word-finding difficulties, paraphasias, neologisms, lexical-semantic deficits, problems during naming or repetition, and impaired comprehension or reading. Dysarthria included slurred or slow speech. Motor deficits included all documented disorders of movement as follows: altered muscle tone (dystonia or asterixis).

### Thalamic activity and biochemical changes in individuals with neuropathic pain after spinal cord injury [^116rGceX]. Pain (2014). Low credibility.

There is increasing evidence relating thalamic changes to the generation and/or maintenance of neuropathic pain. We have recently reported that neuropathic orofacial pain is associated with altered thalamic anatomy, biochemistry, and activity, which may result in disturbed thalamocortical oscillatory circuits. Despite this evidence, it is possible that these thalamic changes are not responsible for the presence of pain per se but result as a consequence of the injury.

To clarify this subject, we compared brain activity and biochemistry in 12 people with below-level neuropathic pain after complete thoracic spinal cord injury with 11 people with similar injuries and no neuropathic pain, and 21 age- and gender-matched healthy control subjects. Quantitative arterial spinal labelling was used to measure thalamic activity, and magnetic resonance spectroscopy was used to determine changes in neuronal variability quantifying N-acetylaspartate and alterations in inhibitory function quantifying gamma amino butyric acid.

This study revealed that the presence of neuropathic pain is associated with significant changes in thalamic biochemistry and neuronal activity. More specifically, the presence of neuropathic pain after spinal cord injury is associated with significant reductions in thalamic N-acetylaspartate, gamma amino butyric acid content, and blood flow in the region of the thalamic reticular nucleus. Spinal cord injury on its own did not account for these changes. These findings support the hypothesis that neuropathic pain is associated with altered thalamic structure and function.

### Central post-stroke pain syndrome: Yet another use for gabapentin [^112TcPqC]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2002). Low credibility.

Although gabapentin was originally developed for treating partial seizures, it has been used mainly to treat various peripheral neuropathic pain conditions; however, there is very limited experience with gabapentin for the treatment of pain conditions of the central nervous system, like central post-stroke pain syndrome. We report the case of a 45-year-old man with central post-stroke pain syndrome who failed to respond to a variety of oral analgesics. Within two weeks of the inception of gabapentin therapy, his average pain was significantly reduced and his level of function improved. We conclude that gabapentin may be an effective medication for the treatment of central post-stroke pain syndrome.

### Thalamic sensory strokes with and without pain: Differences in lesion patterns in the ventral posterior thalamus [^115h93GA]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2012). Low credibility.

Vascular lesions of the posterolateral thalamus typically result in a somatosensory syndrome in which some patients develop central neuropathic post-stroke pain (CPSP). Damage to the spinothalamic tract terminus is assumed to be a prerequisite for thalamic CPSP. At the nuclear level, it remains debated whether the ventral posterolateral nucleus (VPL) or the posterior portion of the ventral medial nucleus (VMpo) constitutes the decisive lesion site. The hypothesis of the study was that lesion location in thalamic CPSP patients differs from that in thalamic stroke patients without pain, and the aim was to identify whether this difference comprises the VPL and/or the VMpo.

Thirty patients with chronic thalamic stroke and a persistent contralateral somatosensory syndrome were examined. CPSP patients (n = 18) were compared with non-pain control patients. By coregistration of a digitized thalamic atlas with T1-weighted MR images, lesion clusters were allocated to the thalamic nuclei.

The VPL was affected in both groups, but CPSP lesion clusters comprised the more posterior, inferior, and lateral parts of the VPL compared with controls. Additional partial involvement of the VMpo was seen in only three pain patients. In three other pain patients, lesions involved neither the VPL nor the VMpo but mainly affected the anterior pulvinar.

This study specifies the role of the VPL in thalamic CPSP and shows that the posterolateral and inferior parts, in particular, are critically lesioned in pain patients.

### Actiq [^115vz2Kp]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Inform patients and caregivers not to increase opioid dosage without first consulting a clinician. Advise patients to seek medical attention if they experience symptoms of hyperalgesia, including worsening pain, increased sensitivity to pain, or new pain [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9), Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

- **Serotonin syndrome**: Inform patients that opioids could cause a rare but potentially life-threatening condition called serotonin syndrome, resulting from the concomitant administration of serotonergic drugs. Warn patients of the symptoms of serotonin syndrome and to seek medical attention right away if symptoms develop. Instruct patients to inform their healthcare providers if they are taking, or plan to take, serotonergic medications [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10), Drug Interactions (7)].

- **MAOI interaction**: Inform patients to avoid taking Actiq while using any drugs that inhibit monoamine oxidase. Patients should not start MAOIs while taking Actiq [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10), Drug Interactions (7)].

- **Important administration instructions**: Instruct patients not to take Actiq for acute pain, postoperative pain, pain from injuries, headache, migraine, or any other short-term pain, even if they have taken other opioid analgesics for these conditions. Instruct patients on the meaning of opioid tolerance and that Actiq is only to be used as a supplemental pain medication for patients with pain requiring around-the-clock opioids, who have developed tolerance to the opioid medication.

### Vascular syndromes of the thalamus [^117BC8kM]. Stroke (2003). Low credibility.

This article reviews the anatomy, connections, and functions of the thalamic nuclei, their vascular supply, and the clinical syndromes that result from thalamic infarction.

- **Summary of review**: Thalamic nuclei are composed of five major functional classes: reticular and intralaminar nuclei that subserve arousal and nociception; sensory nuclei in all major domains; effector nuclei concerned with motor function and aspects of language; associative nuclei that participate in high-level cognitive functions; and limbic nuclei concerned with mood and motivation. Vascular lesions destroy these nuclei in different combinations and produce sensorimotor and behavioral syndromes depending on which nuclei are involved. Tuberothalamic territory strokes produce impairments of arousal and orientation, learning and memory, personality, and executive function; superimposition of temporally unrelated information; and emotional facial paresis. Paramedian infarcts cause decreased arousal, particularly if the lesion is bilateral, and impaired learning and memory. Autobiographical memory impairment and executive failure result from lesions in either of these vascular territories. Language deficits result from left paramedian lesions and from left tuberothalamic lesions that include the ventrolateral nucleus. Right thalamic lesions in both these vascular territories produce visual-spatial deficits, including hemispatial neglect. Inferolateral territory strokes produce contralateral hemisensory loss, hemiparesis and hemiataxia, and pain syndromes that are more common after right thalamic lesions.

### Analgesia in conjunction with normalisation of thermal sensation following deep brain stimulation for central post-stroke pain [^112DB23S]. Pain (2009). Low credibility.

- **Post-operative course**: After optimization of the stimulation parameters (pulse amplitude 2 V, duration 240 μs at 5 Hz), ML's pain was considerably reduced along with a marked improvement in his allodynia. It was noted during optimization that there was a degree of somatotopy evident on stimulation, with the most proximal (apical) electrodes affecting sensation from the lower limbs and the caudal electrodes affecting the face/upper limbs (as previously noted). It was also apparent that the beneficial effects of stimulation were reversed (within minutes) if stimulation ceased, with pain rapidly returning to its previous severity.

Some six weeks post-DBS implantation, ML was followed up in clinic. He had a qualitative symptomatic improvement (pain score reduced from 10/10 to 4/10 NRS), better affect, and little sign of fear of personal contact. There had been no change in his analgesic medication during this period (oxycodone and gabapentin).

We again administered the pain questionnaires and repeated QST. His NPS had reduced from 82 to 49 with a complete resolution of the deep pain and improvements in other aspects of 30–50% (Table 1). He estimated the degree of pain relief provided by DBS as 70% and showed improvements in his BPI interference scores. QST showed that his allodynia had improved considerably in the arm and face (NRS 4 and 5/10 respectively, Fig. 3) on the affected side and the mild right-sided allodynia had completely resolved. His tactile hypoalgesia and hypoaesthesia had also improved on the affected side.

### Analgesia in conjunction with normalisation of thermal sensation following deep brain stimulation for central post-stroke pain [^112PUbeV]. Pain (2009). Low credibility.

Although these findings are encouraging, the analgesic benefits of DBS were relatively short-lived in the case of ML due to increased electrode impedance, possibly secondary to local gliosis, which limited the effectiveness of stimulation. It is also possible that ML developed stimulation tolerance, as has been seen with DBS for other chronic pains. The limited evidence base supporting the use of DBS in CPSP has led the European Federation of Neurological Societies (EFNS) to advise that indications for DBS in CPSP are "equivocal" and that further comparative trials are necessary, a recommendation that we fully endorse.

In conclusion, we report a case of refractory CPSP due to a large temporo-parietal infarct that was improved by DBS of the PVG. This improvement was associated with a normalization of hemi-body sensory inattention. Although we cannot prove causation, we speculate that the beneficial action of DBS of the PVG in this case is via the restoration of normal sensory transmission of innocuous exteroceptive stimuli to higher centers, perhaps by an action on the thalamus. This suggests that even in the case of extensive CNS damage, the pain-generating mechanisms may be amenable to neuromodulatory approaches such as DBS.

### Pure representational neglect after right thalamic lesion [^117FfNs4]. Annals of Neurology (2001). Low credibility.

After a right thalamic stroke, an 86-year-old man presented with acute pure left representational neglect in the absence of any perceptual neglect. On spatial mental imagery tasks, the patient systematically omitted items located on his left side, but only when a vantage point was given. This suggests that (1) pure representational neglect is not merely a residual finding after recovery from global (perceptual and representational) neglect; (2) space representation can be coded by two independent processes: in viewer-centered or world-based (allocentric) coordinates; and (3) the right thalamus serves as a relay in the processing of spatial visual imagery.

### European Stroke Organisation (ESO) guideline on aphasia rehabilitation [^112UQVUS]. European Stroke Journal (2025). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for acute ischemic stroke, more specifically concerning rehabilitation, cognitive, speech, and sensory therapy, ESO 2025 guidelines recommend avoiding the use of transcranial direct stimulation in addition to speech and language therapy for patients with post-stroke aphasia.

### Vaginal allodynia as the presentation of a thalamic tumor [^111q87kh]. Pain (2011). Low credibility.

Central pain syndromes associated with damage to the thalamic sensory relay nuclei have been described predominantly in the stroke literature; however, pain syndromes associated with thalamic neoplasms are much less common. We describe a woman with dyspareunia secondary to vaginal allodynia as the presenting sign of a left thalamic juvenile pilocytic astrocytoma. Subsequent to an uneventful stereotactic biopsy, her vaginal allodynia progressed to hemi-body allodynia. We believe that this is the first reported case of isolated vaginal allodynia associated with a thalamic neoplasm or any other structural pathology of the central nervous system. This rare case underscores that thalamic pathology, including neoplasms, should be considered in evaluating patients with longstanding and unexplained pain syndromes.

### Practice parameter: The diagnostic evaluation and treatment of trigeminal neuralgia (an evidence-based review): Report of the Quality Standards Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology and the European Federation of Neurological Societies [^115ZxHJz]. Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) is a common cause of facial pain. To address this, several critical questions are considered:

- **Purpose**: The study aims to answer the following questions:
	1. In patients with TN, how often does routine neuroimaging (CT, MRI) identify a cause?
	2. Which features identify patients at increased risk for symptomatic TN (STN; i.e. a structural cause such as a tumor)?
	3. Does high-resolution MRI accurately identify patients with neurovascular compression?
	4. Which drugs effectively treat classic and symptomatic trigeminal neuralgia?
	5. When should surgery be offered?
	6. Which surgical technique gives the longest pain-free period with the fewest complications and good quality of life?

- **Methods**: The study involved a systematic review of the literature by a panel of experts.

- **Conclusions**: In patients with trigeminal neuralgia (TN), routine head imaging identifies structural causes in up to 15% of patients and may be considered useful (Level C). Trigeminal sensory deficits, bilateral involvement of the trigeminal nerve, and abnormal trigeminal reflexes are associated with an increased risk of symptomatic TN (STN) and should be considered useful in distinguishing STN from classic trigeminal neuralgia (Level B). There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the usefulness of MRI to identify neurovascular compression of the trigeminal nerve (Level U). Carbamazepine (Level A) or oxcarbazepine (Level B) should be offered for pain control while baclofen and lamotrigine (Level C) may be considered useful. For patients with TN refractory to medical therapy, Gasserian ganglion percutaneous techniques, gamma knife, and microvascular decompression should be considered.

### Are there predictors for the effects of subthalamic versus thalamic lesions for the treatment of parkinsonian tremor [^115P55EE]. Movement Disorders (2025). Low credibility.

This research explores potential predictors for the effects of subthalamic versus thalamic lesions in the treatment of parkinsonian tremor. The study aims to identify factors that may influence treatment outcomes.

- **Study methodology**: The research design involved a comparative analysis of patients undergoing either subthalamic or thalamic lesions. Patient outcomes were meticulously evaluated based on specific parameters.

- **Results**: Key findings indicated variable outcomes influenced by patient-specific factors such as age, duration of symptoms, and prior treatment history.

- **Conclusion**: Understanding these predictors is crucial for healthcare professionals to optimize treatment strategies for individuals with parkinsonian tremor. Further research is encouraged to validate these findings and improve therapeutic approaches.

### Long-term functional outcome in patients with isolated thalamic stroke: The KOSCO study [^117KbRo3]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). High credibility.

This study investigates the long-term functional outcomes in patients who have experienced isolated thalamic strokes. The research highlights the unique challenges and recovery patterns associated with this specific type of stroke. The findings underscore the importance of tailored rehabilitation programs to improve patient outcomes and enhance quality of life post-stroke. The study is a significant contribution to stroke rehabilitation literature and offers insights for healthcare professionals in designing effective treatment plans.

### Subjective cognitive-affective status following thalamic stroke [^114WXAft]. Journal of Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

Previous patient studies suggest that thalamic stroke may yield persistent deficits in several cognitive domains. At present, the subjective dimension and everyday relevance of these impairments is unclear, since many patients with thalamic stroke only show minor changes on physical examination. Here, we have studied subjective consequences of focal thalamic lesions. A sample of 68 patients with a history of ischemic thalamic stroke was examined by using established clinical self-report questionnaires assessing memory, attention, executive functions, emotional status, and health-related quality of life.

To control for general factors related to cerebrovascular disease, self-reports were compared to an age-matched group of 34 patients with a history of transient ischemic attack. Thalamic lesions were co-registered to an atlas of the human thalamus. Lesion overlap and subtraction analyses were used for lesion-to-symptom mapping.

When both patient groups were compared, no significant differences were found for either questionnaire. However, when subgroups were compared, patients with infarctions involving the posterior thalamus showed significant emotional disturbances and elevated anxiety levels compared to patients with more anterior lesions. Our findings thus indicate the existence of persistent affective impairment associated with chronic lesions of the posterior thalamus. This syndrome may result from damage to connections between the medial pulvinar and extra-thalamic regions involved in affective processing.

### Blood flow responses to deep brain stimulation of thalamus [^114Z3DK4]. Neurology (2002). Low credibility.

Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the ventral intermediate nucleus of the thalamus (VIM) provides remarkable relief of tremor in the limbs contralateral to the side of the brain stimulated. The benefits have been sufficiently dramatic that this is now an accepted clinical treatment of essential as well as other forms of tremor. Despite this clinical benefit, the mechanism of action of DBS remains unknown. In this investigation, we sought to determine the effects of VIM DBS on neuronal function.

- **Methods**: The authors used PET measurements of qualitative regional cerebral blood flow in patients with essential tremor to determine the effects of DBS in the left VIM. Each subject had four to six scans with the arms at rest and DBS turned either on or off during alternate scans. Continuous physiologic monitoring revealed no tremor during any of the scans. The PET images from each subject were aligned, averaged, and coregistered to a standard image oriented in stereotactic space.

- **Results**: The authors used subtraction image analysis with statistical parametric mapping methods and a restricted volume search to identify a significantly increased flow response at the site of stimulation in the thalamus. An exploratory analysis revealed increased flow in the ipsilateral supplementary motor area, a region that receives afferents from VIM.

- **Conclusions**: The increased blood flow at terminal fields of thalamocortical projections suggests that DBS stimulates and does not inactivate projection neurons in VIM thalamus.

### Tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabidiol as an oromucosal spray in a 1:1 ratio: A therapeutic option for patients with central post-stroke pain syndrome [^1138DvmY]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

Central pain after stroke due to brainstem infarction is very rare, and treatment is difficult as specific guidelines are lacking. This report details a 61-year-old female patient who, after experiencing a posterolateral left medulla oblongata insult with incomplete Wallenberg syndrome, developed burning and tingling pain in the contralateral leg and burning and shooting pain in the ipsilateral face in trigeminal branches 1 and 2.

More than three years of therapy with amitriptyline, gabapentin, pregabalin, and various grade II and III opioids proved ineffective or resulted in intolerable side effects. The administration of tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabidiol as an oromucosal spray in a 1:1 ratio improved the patient's pain and quality of life quickly and permanently. The encouraging results in the present case may suggest that treatment with medical cannabis should be considered in similar cases when standard therapies are insufficient.

### Management of central poststroke pain: Systematic review of randomized controlled trials [^113MphAd]. Stroke (2015). High credibility.

Central poststroke pain is a chronic neuropathic disorder that follows a stroke. Research on its management is limited, and no review has evaluated all therapies for central poststroke pain. We conducted a systematic review of randomized controlled trials to evaluate therapies for central poststroke pain. We identified eligible trials, in any language, by systematic searches of AMED, CENTRAL, CINAHL, DARE, EMBASE, HealthSTAR, MEDLINE, and PsychINFO. Eligible trials enrolled ≥ 10 patients with central poststroke pain, randomly assigned them to an active therapy or a control arm, and collected outcome data ≥ 14 days after treatment. Pairs of reviewers, independently and in duplicate, screened titles and abstracts of identified citations, reviewed full texts of potentially eligible trials, and extracted information from eligible studies. We used a modified Cochrane tool to evaluate the risk of bias of eligible studies and collected patient-important outcomes according to recommendations by the Initiative on Methods, Measurement, and Pain Assessment in Clinical Trials. We conducted, when possible, random effects meta-analyses and evaluated our certainty in treatment effects using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation System.

Eight eligible English-language randomized controlled trials (459 patients) tested anticonvulsants, an antidepressant, an opioid antagonist, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, and acupuncture. Results suggested that all therapies had little to no effect on central poststroke pain.
