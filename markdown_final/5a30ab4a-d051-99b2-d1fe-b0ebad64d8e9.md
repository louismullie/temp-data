## Question

How do statin dosages vary for primary versus secondary prevention of CVD?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how statin dosages differ between primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core distinction between primary and secondary prevention and why that drives different intensity recommendations. Then, I should verify the evidence base for statin intensity in primary prevention, including what doses were actually studied and whether high-intensity statins have been tested head-to-head. Next, I will review the evidence base for secondary prevention, including randomized trials of high- versus moderate-intensity therapy and guideline-directed intensity targets. After that, I should confirm how intensity is defined by expected LDL-C reduction and give concrete dose examples. Finally, I will consider special populations, safety trade-offs, and synthesize a practical, guideline-concordant recommendation with caveats about shared decision-making and monitoring.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame: primary prevention treats patients without established ASCVD, whereas secondary prevention treats patients with clinical ASCVD such as MI, stroke, TIA, or symptomatic PAD, and this distinction fundamentally alters the absolute risk and the magnitude of benefit expected from more intensive LDL-C lowering, which in turn shapes dose intensity recommendations [^a6b88315] [^a7912a49].

> Now, for primary prevention, I need to check the strength of evidence for statin intensity. The USPSTF concludes that most trials used moderate-intensity statins and that there are limited data directly comparing different intensities for hard outcomes, so moderate-intensity therapy is reasonable for most eligible adults aged 40–75 years with risk factors and elevated 10-year ASCVD risk, with shared decision-making when risk is borderline [^97cfb517] [^a7912a49]. Wait, let me verify whether any primary prevention trials actually used high-intensity dosing; yes, JUPITER used rosuvastatin 20 mg, but it was compared with placebo rather than with moderate-intensity statins, so it does not establish incremental benefit of high- versus moderate-intensity in a head-to-head primary prevention population, and VA/DoD explicitly recommends against maximizing statin dose in primary prevention due to lack of added benefit signal and higher adverse effect risk [^40b71a4c] [^2a4cc9b9]. I should also confirm that ACC/AHA primary prevention guidance aligns with moderate intensity for most, reserving high intensity for special high-risk primary prevention scenarios like LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL or diabetes with multiple risk factors, which it does [^ddec3723] [^0817b1ad].

> For secondary prevention, I will now examine the evidence supporting higher intensity. Multiple high-quality sources support high-intensity statins as first-line in adults ≤ 75 years with clinical ASCVD, with meta-analyses showing about a 15% further reduction in major vascular events with more intensive regimens compared with less intensive therapy, and randomized trials like IDEAL demonstrating fewer nonfatal MIs with high-dose atorvastatin versus usual-dose simvastatin after MI, albeit with more transaminase elevations and discontinuations in the high-dose arm [^2173398a] [^afa873a5]. Hold on, I should verify guideline language; ACC/AHA performance measures and the 2022 ACC expert consensus both endorse high-intensity statins for secondary prevention when tolerated, with a target of ≥ 50% LDL-C reduction, and recommend stepping down to moderate intensity only if high intensity is not tolerated or contraindicated [^a6b88315] [^c0d53b42].

> Next, I should review how intensity is defined clinically. High-intensity statins lower LDL-C by about 50% or more on average, moderate-intensity by about 30–49%, and low-intensity by less than 30%, with representative high-intensity regimens including atorvastatin 40–80 mg or rosuvastatin 20–40 mg, and moderate-intensity regimens including atorvastatin 10–20 mg, rosuvastatin 5–10 mg, simvastatin 20–40 mg, or pitavastatin 2–4 mg, which operationalizes the dose–response relationship seen in trials and guidelines [^868851c9] [^5e030d36] [^20eaccbf].

> But wait, what about special populations and safety trade-offs. In adults older than 75 years, evidence is weaker for initiating high-intensity statins, so guidelines allow either moderate or high intensity with individualized assessment of benefit, comorbidities, and patient preferences, and observational data suggest older adults are less likely to receive high-intensity statins for secondary prevention yet report similar symptom burdens, supporting careful but not overly conservative dosing when indicated [^458db767] [^88005326]. I should double-check diabetes and very high LDL-C in primary prevention; ACC/AHA supports high-intensity statins for LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL and allows consideration of high intensity in diabetes with multiple risk factors, reflecting higher baseline risk and greater absolute benefit despite the primary prevention label [^ddec3723] [^0817b1ad]. Regarding adverse effects, meta-analyses in primary prevention show small increases in self-reported muscle symptoms, liver enzyme abnormalities, and renal or ocular events, but these do not outweigh the cardiovascular benefits, reinforcing the preference for moderate intensity in primary prevention rather than routine high-intensity use [^51637dac] [^c0423d38].

> Let me synthesize and make sure I'm not overgeneralizing. In primary prevention, start with moderate-intensity statins for eligible adults aged 40–75 years with elevated risk, avoid routine high-intensity dosing because head-to-head superiority data are lacking and harm may increase, and reserve high-intensity therapy for select high-risk primary prevention scenarios such as LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL or diabetes with multiple risk factors after shared decision-making [^a7912a49] [^ddec3723] [^0817b1ad]. In secondary prevention, initiate high-intensity statins in adults ≤ 75 years unless contraindicated, titrate to a ≥ 50% LDL-C reduction when possible, and step down to moderate intensity only if high intensity is not tolerated, while in adults > 75 years individualize intensity based on comorbidity, frailty, and patient preference rather than reflexively choosing high intensity [^a6b88315] [^c0d53b42] [^458db767]. Hold on, I should verify that this aligns with contemporary VA/DoD and ACC guidance; yes, both emphasize moderate intensity for primary prevention and high intensity for secondary prevention when appropriate, with attention to tolerance and risk–benefit balance [^40b71a4c] [^c0d53b42].

Statin dosing differs by prevention type: **moderate-intensity statins** are first-line for primary prevention in adults 40–75 years with elevated ASCVD risk, balancing benefit and harm [^a7912a49] [^97cfb517]. In contrast, **high-intensity statins** are recommended for secondary prevention in adults ≤ 75 years with clinical ASCVD to achieve ≥ 50% LDL-C reduction and reduce recurrent events [^a6b88315] [^c0d53b42]. For adults > 75 years, use moderate-intensity statins and individualize high-intensity therapy based on tolerance and comorbidities [^458db767] [^c0d53b42]. High-intensity statins are not routinely used in primary prevention due to limited incremental benefit and higher adverse effect risk [^40b71a4c] [^2a4cc9b9].

## Primary prevention

### Recommended statin intensity and dosing

- **Moderate-intensity statins**: First-line for adults 40–75 years with elevated ASCVD risk (≥ 7.5% 10-year risk) [^a7912a49] [^88dbcf29].
- **High-intensity statins**: Consider only for very high-risk primary prevention (e.g. LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL or diabetes with multiple risk factors) [^ddec3723] [^0817b1ad].
- **Low-intensity statins**: Not recommended due to inferior LDL-C lowering and limited outcome data [^notfound].

---

### Evidence supporting moderate-intensity statins

- **RCTs**: Most primary prevention trials used moderate-intensity statins (e.g. atorvastatin 10–20 mg, rosuvastatin 5–10 mg) and showed significant reductions in cardiovascular events [^8b4fbcbc] [^5f11b3d0].
- **Benefit-harm balance**: Moderate-intensity statins provide favorable net benefit with low rates of adverse effects in primary prevention [^51637dac] [^c0423d38].
- **Guidelines**: USPSTF and ACC/AHA recommend moderate-intensity statins for primary prevention based on risk assessment and shared decision-making [^a7912a49] [^88dbcf29].

---

### Limitations of high-intensity statins in primary prevention

- **Limited evidence**: Few RCTs directly compare high- vs moderate-intensity statins in primary prevention; JUPITER (rosuvastatin 20 mg) vs placebo showed benefit but did not establish superiority over moderate intensity [^40b71a4c] [^2a4cc9b9].
- **Increased adverse effects**: Higher risk of muscle symptoms, liver enzyme elevations, and diabetes with high-intensity statins in primary prevention [^51637dac] [^c0423d38].
- **Guideline caution**: VA/DoD advises against routine high-intensity statins in primary prevention due to lack of added benefit and higher risk [^40b71a4c] [^2a4cc9b9].

---

## Secondary prevention

### Recommended statin intensity and dosing

- **High-intensity statins**: First-line for adults ≤ 75 years with clinical ASCVD (e.g. atorvastatin 40–80 mg, rosuvastatin 20–40 mg) to achieve ≥ 50% LDL-C reduction [^a6b88315] [^c0d53b42].
- **Moderate-intensity statins**: Use if high-intensity therapy is contraindicated or not tolerated [^458db767] [^c0d53b42].
- **Individualization in older adults**: For > 75 years, tailor intensity to tolerance, comorbidities, and patient preferences [^458db767] [^c0d53b42].

---

### Evidence supporting high-intensity statins in secondary prevention

- **RCTs**: IDEAL and TNT showed fewer cardiovascular events with high- vs moderate-intensity statins after MI or stable CAD [^afa873a5].
- **Meta-analyses**: Greater LDL-C lowering with high-intensity statins yields proportional reductions in cardiovascular events and mortality [^0d8f8264] [^91a79258].
- **Guidelines**: ACC/AHA and ESC endorse high-intensity statins for secondary prevention to achieve aggressive LDL-C targets [^a6b88315] [^ff826769].

---

### Special considerations in older adults

In adults > 75 years, **moderate-intensity statins** are reasonable given limited trial data and higher adverse effect risk; individualize high-intensity therapy based on tolerance and comorbidities [^458db767] [^c0d53b42]. Evidence is limited because older adults are underrepresented in trials, though observational data suggest benefit with moderate-intensity therapy [^2e22668c] [^afa4319d].

## Summary of statin dosing by prevention type

| **Prevention type** | **Recommended statin intensity** | **Examples of statins and doses** | **Evidence/guideline support** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Primary prevention | Moderate-intensity | - Atorvastatin 10–20 mg <br/> - Rosuvastatin 5–10 mg <br/> - Simvastatin 20–40 mg | - USPSTF [^a7912a49] <br/> - ACC/AHA [^88dbcf29] <br/> - VA/DoD [^40b71a4c] |
| Secondary prevention | High-intensity | - Atorvastatin 40–80 mg <br/> - Rosuvastatin 20–40 mg | - ACC/AHA [^a6b88315] <br/> - ESC [^ff826769] <br/> - IDEAL [^afa873a5] <br/> - TNT [^notfound] |
| Primary prevention (very high risk) | High-intensity (selective) | - Atorvastatin 40–80 mg <br/> - Rosuvastatin 20–40 mg | - ACC/AHA [^ddec3723] <br/> - JUPITER [^notfound] |

---

## Clinical implications and considerations

- **Individualized therapy**: Base statin intensity on patient-specific factors (age, comorbidities, tolerance, preferences) [^458db767] [^c0d53b42].
- **Monitoring**: Regularly assess adherence, adverse effects, and LDL-C response; adjust therapy as needed [^c0423d38].
- **Shared decision-making**: Engage patients in discussions about benefits, risks, and goals of therapy [^a7912a49] [^88dbcf29].

---

Statin dosing is **risk-based**: moderate-intensity for primary prevention and high-intensity for secondary prevention, with individualized adjustments for older adults and very high-risk primary prevention patients.

Clinical Question

Do statins reduce rates of cardiovascular events when used for primary prevention?

Bottom Line

When used for primary prevention, statins are associated with lower rates of all-cause mortality, major vascular events, and revascularizations compared with placebo. Statin therapy is not associated with increased rates of life-threatening adverse effects such as cancer.

One possible solution to improve the use of statins in primary prevention is to apply a stratified treatment strategy, to target optimal treatments in patients with the best trade-off between benefits and harms. This strategy could involve tailoring the type and dosage of statins. Current recommendations on the choice of statin regimen are mainly based on their efficacy in reducing low density lipoprotein cholesterol. Given the different pharmacological mechanisms by which different statins have beneficial and adverse effects, however, classification of the potencies of different types of statins based on their efficacy alone might not be appropriate when considering the safety of treatment. Understanding the dose-response relationships of adverse effects could help determine the optimal therapeutic dose range of statins for primary prevention, avoiding doses that provide little extra benefit but might cause adverse effects.

Most previous systematic reviews of statins focused on efficacy or secondary prevention populations, making it difficult to determine the specific risks of adverse effects in patients without a history of cardiovascular disease. Reviews that examined harms in primary prevention have provided conflicting results, particularly for muscle problems, which were inconsistently defined and involved a wide range of muscle conditions with different severities. In this study, we have systematically reviewed randomised controlled trials in adults without a history of cardiovascular disease, to quantify the associations between statins and adverse events, and to examine how the associations vary by type and dosage of statin. Our aim was to better inform the use of statins in primary prevention of cardiovascular disease.

Research needs and gaps — Priority evidence gaps include determining the balance of benefits and harms of initiating statins for primary prevention in adults 76 years or older; establishing the efficacy and safety of long-term statin use in adults younger than 40 years and the effects of earlier vs delayed initiation in persons with an estimated high long-term (longer than 10 years, lifetime) risk of CVD; conducting trials that directly compare titration to target lipid levels vs fixed-dose therapy and higher- vs lower-intensity statins powered for clinical outcomes; definitively determining whether statin therapy is associated with increased risk of diabetes in primary prevention populations; and clarifying the role of patient preferences across the spectrum of CVD risk.

### Systematic review of clinical guidelines for lipid lowering in the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease events [^4d80db6d]. Open Heart (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This systematic review illustrates the variation in recommendations surrounding optimal on-statin lipid monitoring within secondary prevention. Specifically, there were considerable differences in the recommendations for cholesterol targets (including their use) and the ongoing monitoring of lipid levels over the longer term. These findings reflect the fact that no guideline identified a specifically designed randomised controlled trial to assess either treatment targets or monitoring of therapy. However, such trials are likely to be expensive, although in the future advances with electronic health records may facilitate the evidence base for this. Nonetheless, this systematic review illustrates that better evidence is needed to provide an optimal approach to lipid monitoring in order to balance safety, adherence, cost, and time burden to patients.

All guideline committees are likely to be searching a broadly similar evidence base, where the efficacy and safety of statins has been well established in the prevention of further cardiovascular events. Furthermore, the WHO recommends the use of statins as part of their secondary prevention programme, with the increased risk widely accepted within this population. It is therefore not surprising that all guidelines agree that statins should be commenced as the lipid-lowering therapy with a high level of evidence, commensurate with the availability of randomised controlled trials. Guidelines that specify drugs or doses generally recommend high dose therapy and titrating down as necessary to a tolerated dose, rather than titrating up. This is in line with large randomised controlled trials over the preceding decades that have shown that higher dose statin therapy improves outcomes. Nonetheless, despite this widespread recommendation, there is some evidence to suggest that statins are not consistently prescribed within the secondary prevention population depending on the cardiovascular events experienced. Meanwhile, recommendations for the use of other lipid-lowering therapies illustrate that such guidelines are likely a reflection of the evidence available when the guidelines were created; for example, PCSK9 inhibitors were only discussed in guidelines published after 2016. Therefore, in clinical practice, consideration may need to be given to the timing of the publication where new evidence has emerged.

### Associations between statins and adverse events in primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: systematic review with pairwise, network, and dose-response meta-analyses [^8950e031]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide. Statins are effective in reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease and have been recommended in clinical guidelines as frontline treatment for the prevention of cardiovascular disease. Various adverse events have been reported in clinical use, however, including muscle problems, liver dysfunction, renal insufficiency, diabetes, and eye conditions. Previous studies have shown that uptake and persistence with statin treatment is poor and, as a result, millions of patients could be missing out on life saving treatment. This underuse is partly because of concerns about potential adverse effects, and these concerns are particularly evident when statins are used for primary prevention in asymptomatic patients without a history of cardiovascular disease. In these individuals, who have a lower average risk of cardiovascular disease, the absolute benefits of statins are smaller than in a secondary prevention population with previous cardiovascular disease events, and therefore the benefit-to-harm balance of treatment might be less favourable. Nevertheless, recent guidelines have recommended wider use of statins for primary prevention, making a large population at low risk of cardiovascular disease eligible for treatment and exposed to the risks of adverse effects. This increased eligibility for intervention with statins has been controversial, and better understanding of the risks of adverse effects is needed to determine the trade-off between the benefits and harms of statins in a primary prevention population.

### Sub-optimal cholesterol response to initiation of statins and future risk of cardiovascular disease [^9693b0f3]. Heart (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of death globally. The positive correlation between the incidence of CVD and levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) concentration has been well-established. Statins are recognised as being effective in lowering cholesterol and reducing the risk of future CVD events for both primary or secondary prevention.

Following a meta-analysis of cholesterol treatment trials, the percentage reductions in LDL-C achieved by specific statins (and their doses) have been established from the data of patients in whom statins reduced CVD events. Accordingly, national guidelines in the USA and UK recommend intended LDL-C reduction targets for statin therapy to reduce CVD. The 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines suggested a fixed dose (or intensity) of statin for each risk category, with an intended LDL-C reduction of 30–49% and ≥ 50% for moderate and high intensity statins, respectively. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines in the UK aim for > 40% reduction in non-HDL-C.

Both individual biological and genetic variability in LDL-C response to statin therapy, as well as variation in adherence, have been identified. However, there is limited evidence on variation in LDL-C response in the general population for patients initiated on statins for primary prevention of CVD.

In this large, prospective open population cohort study, we sought to assess differences in LDL-C response in primary care patients initiated on statins and their impact on future CVD events.

Other major guideline documents — older patients: The 2013 ACC/AHA Guideline includes different treatment regimens for individuals > 75 years of age compared to younger persons, recommending moderate intensity statin therapy for secondary prevention in those > 75 years versus high intensity in younger individuals, using the Pooled Cohort Risk Equations and provider–patient discussion for primary prevention without a specific intensity recommendation for those > 75 years. The International Atherosclerosis Society recommends for persons > 65 years the use of short-term (10-year) Framingham risk scoring (recalibrated for country) to estimate CHD risk and elevation of the estimated value by 1/3 to estimate total ASCVD risk, suggesting statins for moderately-high or high estimated risk while considering polypharmacy, drug–drug interactions, and cost. The European Atherosclerosis Society/European Society of Cardiology advocate secondary prevention in the same manner as in younger patients (class I, level of evidence B), starting at low dosage and titrating to the same targets (class I, level of evidence C), and recommend primary prevention for those with 1 or more additional risk factors aside from age (class IIb, level of evidence B). The Canadian Cardiovascular Society recommends statins without specific upper age cutoffs for secondary prevention and, for primary prevention, 10-year Framingham scoring for men ages 40–75 years and for women ages 50–75 years.

### Secondary cvd prevention-lipid modification strategies: a critical analysis [^fd1c4a67]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2017). Low credibility.

Lipid modification holds the key to effective secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD). However there is a controversy on whether it's all about targeting specific lipid sub fractions to a particular level or a direct effect of the agent(s) used or both. This review intends to look into these important issues from an evidence-based perspective. What is the appropriate timing of testing for lipid profile after a cardiovascular event? What is the rationale behind initiating with a high dose statin after an acute coronary event? What is the role of targeting lipid sub fractions beside LDL cholesterol? Is there any role for non-statin based therapy after an acute cardiovascular event? What constitutes a long-term lipid modification strategy in patients post CVD? These are very important questions, which needs to be addressed adequately as well as scientifically. The secondary CVD preventive strategies form a lipid perspective, which requires a thorough review.

### Associations between statins and adverse events in primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: systematic review with pairwise, network, and dose-response meta-analyses [^bdb382c1]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Methods

The study was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). The study protocol was registered on PROSPERO, the international prospective register of systematic reviews (registration No CRD42020169955).

Data sources and search strategies

To maximise the efficiency of the search, we first identified studies from six large scale systematic reviews of clinical trials of treatment with statins; the most comprehensive systematic review included studies published up to March 2013. To supplement the previous systematic reviews and to identify more recent studies, we searched PubMed/Medline, Embase (Ovid), and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) for studies published from 1 January 2013 to 1 August 2020. Supplementary table 1 describes the systematic search strategies.

Eligibility criteria and study selection

Eligible studies were randomised controlled trials in adults (> 18 years) without previous cardiovascular events that compared statins with non-statin controls or compared different types or dosages of statins and reported at least one outcome of interest. Non-statin controls included placebo, usual care, and no treatment. Statin treatments were monotherapy or add-on treatment to usual care or non-drug treatments (eg, diet or exercise). Studies where 70% or more of the participants had no history of cardiovascular disease were considered eligible to avoid excluding large trials with a small proportion of patients with cardiovascular disease and to limit the loss of information about primary prevention patients. To avoid including early phase trials for mechanistic research, studies that enrolled fewer than 100 participants or lasted for less than four weeks were excluded. Supplementary table 2 provides the full eligibility criteria. Two reviewers (TC and LA) independently selected eligible studies by screening the title and abstract and assessing the full text. Discrepancies were resolved by consensus.

### Intensive statin therapy compared with moderate dosing for prevention of cardiovascular events: a meta-analysis of > 40 000 patients [^0d8f8264]. European Heart Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Aims

Statin therapy is associated with important benefits for patients at risk of, and with, established cardiovascular disease. There is widespread interest in whether intensive dosing of statins yields larger treatment effects. We aimed to determine if intensive dosing is clinically important using a meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials (RCTs).

Methods

We conducted comprehensive searches of electronic databases from inception to December 2010. We included any RCT evaluating a larger dose with a clinically common dose. Two reviewers independently extracted data, in duplicate. We performed random-effects meta-analysis and a trial sequential analysis.

Results

We identified 10 RCTs enrolling a total of 41 778 participants. Trials followed patients for a mean of 2.5 years. We did not find statistically significant effects on all-cause mortality [relative risk (RR) 0.92, 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.83–1.03, P = 0.14, I(2) = 38%] or cardiovascular disease (CVD) deaths (RR 0.89, 95% CI, 0.78–1.01, P = 0.07, I(2) = 34%). When we pooled the composite endpoint of coronary heart disease (CHD) death plus non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), we found a significant protective effect of intensive statin dosing (RR 0.90, 95% CI, 0.84–0.96, P ≤ 0.0001, I(2) = 0%). We also found a significant effect on non-fatal MIs (RR 0.82, 95% CI, 0.76–0.89, P ≤ 0.0001, I(2) = 0%) and a significant reduction in the composite of fatal and non-fatal strokes (excluding transient ischaemic attacks) reported in 10 RCTs (RR 0.86, 95% CI, 0.77–0.96, P = 0.006, I(2) = 0%). A subgroup analysis of three trials examining acute coronary syndrome patients found significant effects on all-cause (RR 0.75, 95% CI, 0.61–0.91, P = 0.005, I(2) = 0%) and CVD mortality (RR 0.74, 95% CI, 0.59–0.94, P = 0.013, I(2) = 0%) with intensive dosing. Applying an analysis of optimal information size on the primary analysis, we found that the evidence for CHD death plus non-fatal MIs is conclusive. The evidence for CVD deaths alone is not yet conclusive.

Conclusions

Available evidence suggests that intensive statin therapy reduces the risk of non-fatal events and may have a role in reducing mortality.

### Statin use for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^bcffd778]. JAMA (2016). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States, accounting for 1 of every 3 deaths among adults.

Objective

To update the 2008 US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation on screening for lipid disorders in adults.

Evidence Review

The USPSTF reviewed the evidence on the benefits and harms of screening for and treatment of dyslipidemia in adults 21 years and older; the benefits and harms of statin use in reducing CVD events and mortality in adults without a history of CVD events; whether the benefits of statin use vary by subgroup, clinical characteristics, or dosage; and the benefits of various treatment strategies in adults 40 years and older without a history of CVD events.

Conclusions and Recommendations

The USPSTF recommends initiating use of low- to moderate-dose statins in adults aged 40 to 75 years without a history of CVD who have 1 or more CVD risk factors (dyslipidemia, diabetes, hypertension, or smoking) and a calculated 10-year CVD event risk of 10% or greater (B recommendation). The USPSTF recommends that clinicians selectively offer low- to moderate-dose statins to adults aged 40 to 75 years without a history of CVD who have 1 or more CVD risk factors and a calculated 10-year CVD event risk of 7.5% to 10% (C recommendation). The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of initiating statin use in adults 76 years and older (I statement).

### Pharmacologic treatment of hyperlipidemia [^13ae5fdb]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Pharmacologic treatment of hyperlipidemia in conjunction with therapeutic lifestyle changes can be used for both primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. Statins have the most convincing data for primary prevention, especially for higher risk patients. Therefore, risk stratification is essential. Statin therapy is also recommended for secondary prevention in all patients with known cardiovascular disease or the risk equivalent. High-dose statins should be initiated in patients with acute coronary syndrome. Omega-3 fatty acids may be a good alternative after myocardial infarction for patients who cannot tolerate statins. Fibrates and niacin have not been shown to reduce all-cause mortality in secondary prevention, but may be useful adjuncts when statins alone cannot adequately control lipid levels. Other cholesterol-lowering medications used for primary or secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease have not been shown to consistently improve patient-oriented outcomes. There is good evidence for using statins in the secondary prevention of stroke and peripheral arterial disease.

### Statins for all? [^e360cd1a]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Recent guidelines for cholesterol management proposed by the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and American Heart Association (AHA) recommended statin therapy for most men in their 60s and most women in their 70s. If these guidelines are followed in the United States, most adults will eventually take statins. A companion article in this journal goes a step further by proposing statin initiation for mostly everyone about 10 years earlier. Treatment in ACC/AHA guidelines does not depend on cholesterol levels, for either statin initiation or treatment goals. Selection of patients for statin therapy depends instead on multifactorial risk assessment derived from prospective studies in subgroups of the US population. Because of expansion of statin therapy, the issue of the reliability of risk assessment has come to the fore. Some evidence suggests that the ACC/AHA risk algorithm overestimates risk in many persons; if so, this would lead to statin therapy beyond what was intended. Some investigators favor assessment of risk based on presence or absence of categorical risk factors or higher risk conditions. Others propose selection of individuals for statin therapy grounded in measurement of atherosclerosis burden. Finally, an alternate approach to cholesterol management is to establish cholesterol goals for secondary and primary prevention. Cholesterol levels, and not global risk assessment, here define the intensity of therapy. The use of cholesterol goals allows more flexibility in treatment by taking advantage of lifestyle therapies and various drugs and their doses to attain defined goals.

### Population impact&efficiency of benefit-targeted versus risk-targeted statin prescribing for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease [^1b7ef334]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Comparing Strategies

Our primary comparison was between risk‐targeted prescribing, defined as moderate‐intensity statins prescribed according to level of baseline risk, and benefit‐targeted prescribing, defined as moderate‐intensity statins prescribed according to level of expected ARR. Prevention impact‐efficiency curves are provided to illustrated the trade‐offs, labeling thresholds of 7.5% for baseline risk (the 2013 Guideline 2), 2.3% for expected ARR (for comparison with previous analyses 3), and equivalent‐impact thresholds.

For comparison and context, we present results relative to a 10% impact goal, which is half of the Healthy People 2020 impact objective of reducing coronary heart disease deaths by 20% 5 (loosely defined), assuming the other half should be attained by smoking cessation, lifestyle modification, blood pressure control, or other methods. We also present results for: (1) a hypothetical perfect risk prediction algorithm (where risk is 100% in the high‐risk group and 0% in the low‐risk group, and there is only 1 logical treatment threshold); (2) age‐targeted prescribing (a less‐accurate, but more easily applied method of statin targeting); (3) benefit‐targeted prescribing using the average relative risk reduction across baseline risk groups (0.75 per mmol/L LDL reduction for primary prevention and 0.80 for secondary prevention; see Figure 1 of published meta‐analysis 1) without the baseline risk interaction modeled by Thanassoulis et al 3; (4) high‐intensity statins (with 50% LDL reduction for comparability 3); and (5) overall impact and efficiency accounting for treatment of all patients with diabetes mellitus, and LDL ≥ 190 mg/dL, and with expanded age eligibility for targeted statin therapy to include adults < 40 and > 75 years of age.

Summary of recommendations

Recommendations for the use of statin medication, cholesterol targets and the frequency of monitoring are presented in table 3.

Table 3
Summary of recommendations

Treatment recommendations

All of the guidelines presented recommendations for the treatment of the secondary prevention population, with all recommending statins as the primary therapy. Only UK/Scottish guidelines suggested the specific drug and dose, namely, atorvastatin 80 mg, with many instead recommending the maximally tolerated high-intensity doses in general, with lower doses considered when contraindications were present, or they were poorly tolerated by the patients. Few caveats were stated regarding the prescription of statins. For example, all stroke guidelines recommended statins only when the cause of the stroke was likely to be atherosclerotic, with the South African Stroke Society additionally only recommending them in the case of total cholesterol > 3.5 mmol/L, and the Australia Stroke Society only considering them appropriate when the patient's life expectancy was considered reasonable. For the secondary prevention population as a whole, the European Society of Cardiology and European Atherosclerosis Society (ESCEAS) tailored their recommendations for patients whose baseline LDL was < 1.4 mmol/L at baseline, respectively, with therapy considered rather than offered to these patients. Finally, the 2018 American Consensus (ACD) guidelines stated that the benefit–risk ratio should be considered when offering medication to patients over the age of 75 years.

### Statin use for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^acd3a032]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) — statin primary prevention recommendations state that the USPSTF recommends that clinicians prescribe a statin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) for adults aged 40 to 75 years who have 1 or more CVD risk factors (ie, dyslipidemia, diabetes, hypertension, or smoking) and an estimated 10-year risk of a cardiovascular event of 10% or greater; the USPSTF recommends that clinicians selectively offer a statin for adults aged 40 to 75 years with 1 or more CVD risk factors and an estimated 10-year risk of a cardiovascular event of 7.5% to less than 10%, noting that the likelihood of benefit is smaller in this group than in persons with a 10-year risk of 10% or greater; and for adults 76 years or older the evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of initiating a statin for the primary prevention of CVD events and mortality.

### American diabetes association indications for statins in diabetes: is there evidence? [^bc77fbc2]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Table 1
ADA evidence grading system for clinical practice recommendations

These guidelines are based on numerous trials showing a benefit for statin therapy both as primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease and mortality. Trials like the Collaborative Atorvastatin Diabetes Study (CARDS), proved beyond doubt that patients with type 2 diabetes and other risk factors for CVD should be treated with a statin, apparently disregarding their initial LDL cholesterol level. However, most of these trials did not set a goal LDL cholesterol level for treatment but examined the effect of a predetermined statin dose on the outcome. Extrapolated from these trials and from epidemiologic data, a goal LDL of 100 mg% seems adequate for the majority of patients. Yet because of the problematic interpretation of clinical trial data that was not inherent in its basic structure, alternative treatment goals have arisen, including a reduction of LDL by 40% (in patients where LDL reduction could not reach the 100 mg% goal) or a reduction below 70 mg% (in very-high-risk patients — those with prior cardiovascular disease or acute coronary syndromes).

Some questions are raised from these guidelines. First, the overall efficacy of statin use for primary prevention raises the question who should not get a statin, i.e. what is the evidence for their use as primary prevention in diabetic individuals. Should a statin be given on an LDL-based treat-to-target goal (as stated in the guidelines, reduce the LDL below 100 mg%), existence of other vascular risk factors, age, or regardless of the measured cholesterol at predetermined doses (similar to current use of aspirin).

The second question is what is the evidence for the target LDL in secondary prevention in high-risk diabetic individuals — how aggressive should we be, and should we limit ourselves to an LDL-targeted therapy versus a comprehensive high-dose statin strategy. Again there is the question of the target LDL versus the "evidence-based" fixed dose?

USPSTF assessment of magnitude of net benefit — The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that statin use for adults aged 40 to 75 years with no history of CVD and an estimated 10-year CVD event risk of 10% or greater has at least a moderate net benefit; with an estimated 10-year CVD risk of 7.5% to less than 10% has at least a small net benefit and the decision to initiate therapy should depend on individual patient preference; and in adults 76 years or older with no history of CVD the evidence is insufficient to determine the balance of benefits and harms.

### 2015 ACC / AHA focused update of secondary prevention lipid performance measures: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on performance measures [^2173398a]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2016). Medium credibility.

Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) performance measure denominator and evidence — The target population for the ASCVD PM includes women and men between 18 and 75 years of age who have clinical ASCVD, which includes the following: ACS, history of MI, stable or unstable angina, coronary (including PCI) or other arterial revascularization, stroke, transient ischemic attack, or PAD, and patients with clinical ASCVD represent 1 of 4 major groups identified by the writing committee of the Cholesterol Guidelines. For these patients, treatment with a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitor, commonly known as a statin, is clearly beneficial, and the potential for reduction of risk for ASCVD with statins in these patients clearly exceeds the potential for adverse effects. Meta-analyses of individual participant data from 26 RCTs demonstrated reduction in all-cause mortality, and of the 26 RCTs included, 5 trials (39 612 subjects, all of whom had CAD) compared more versus less intensive statin regimens, with more intensive regimens producing a highly significant 15% further reduction in major vascular events. On extensive examination of clinical studies from the literature, the current clinical evidence does not support the notion that titrating lipid therapy to achieve proposed low LDL-C levels is beneficial or safe, whereas compelling evidence supports near-universal empirical statin therapy for patients at high cardiovascular risk regardless of their LDL-C levels. The recommendation to initiate statins for secondary prevention is based on strong evidence in which benefit far exceeds risk.

### Associations between statins and adverse events in primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: systematic review with pairwise, network, and dose-response meta-analyses [^51637dac]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Abstract

Objective

To assess the associations between statins and adverse events in primary prevention of cardiovascular disease and to examine how the associations vary by type and dosage of statins.

Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis.

Data sources

Studies were identified from previous systematic reviews and searched in Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, up to August 2020.

Review methods

Randomised controlled trials in adults without a history of cardiovascular disease that compared statins with non-statin controls or compared different types or dosages of statins were included.

Main outcome measures

Primary outcomes were common adverse events: self-reported muscle symptoms, clinically confirmed muscle disorders, liver dysfunction, renal insufficiency, diabetes, and eye conditions. Secondary outcomes included myocardial infarction, stroke, and death from cardiovascular disease as measures of efficacy.

Data synthesis

A pairwise meta-analysis was conducted to calculate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for each outcome between statins and non-statin controls, and the absolute risk difference in the number of events per 10 000 patients treated for a year was estimated. A network meta-analysis was performed to compare the adverse effects of different types of statins. An E max model based meta-analysis was used to examine the dose-response relationships of the adverse effects of each statin.

Results

62 trials were included, with 120 456 participants followed up for an average of 3.9 years. Statins were associated with an increased risk of self-reported muscle symptoms (21 trials, odds ratio 1.06 (95% confidence interval 1.01 to 1.13); absolute risk difference 15 (95% confidence interval 1 to 29)), liver dysfunction (21 trials, odds ratio 1.33 (1.12 to 1.58); absolute risk difference 8 (3 to 14)), renal insufficiency (eight trials, odds ratio 1.14 (1.01 to 1.28); absolute risk difference 12 (1 to 24)), and eye conditions (six trials, odds ratio 1.23 (1.04 to 1.47); absolute risk difference 14 (2 to 29)) but were not associated with clinically confirmed muscle disorders or diabetes. The increased risks did not outweigh the reduction in the risk of major cardiovascular events. Atorvastatin, lovastatin, and rosuvastatin were individually associated with some adverse events, but few significant differences were found between types of statins. An E max dose-response relationship was identified for the effect of atorvastatin on liver dysfunction, but the dose-response relationships for the other statins and adverse effects were inconclusive.

Conclusions

For primary prevention of cardiovascular disease, the risk of adverse events attributable to statins was low and did not outweigh their efficacy in preventing cardiovascular disease, suggesting that the benefit-to-harm balance of statins is generally favourable. Evidence to support tailoring the type or dosage of statins to account for safety concerns before starting treatment was limited.

### Statins in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease [^e72499f4]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2013). Medium credibility.

Statins are widely used in the evidence-based lowering of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. The use of these drugs for secondary prevention of CVD is well founded, but their expanding use in primary prevention — in individuals without documented CVD — has raised some concerns. Firstly, evidence suggests that, in primary prevention, statins substantially decrease CVD morbidity, but only moderately reduce CVD mortality. Secondly, long-term statin use might cause adverse effects, such as incident diabetes mellitus. Thirdly, the cost-effectiveness of such a strategy is unclear, and has to be balanced against the risk of 'overmedicating' the general population. Data clearly support the use of statins for primary prevention in high-risk individuals, in whom the strategy is cost-effective and the benefits exceed the risks. Whether primary prevention is beneficial in individuals at low or moderate risk is not certain. Therefore, the prescription of statins for primary prevention should be individualized on the basis of clinical judgment, particularly for low-risk individuals. In appropriately selected individuals, statins should also be used for primary prevention of ischaemic stroke and transient ischaemic attack.

### Association of primary care providers' beliefs of statins for primary prevention and statin prescription [^079d86f2]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) Cholesterol Management Guideline included major shifts in recommended approaches to primary and secondary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). 1 The ACC/AHA guideline significantly expanded the population eligible for statin lipid‐lowering therapy for primary prevention, mainly by emphasizing recommendations based on estimated cardiovascular risk and abandoning low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol targets. One study estimated that 12.8 million additional adults would be eligible for statin therapy compared with prior guidelines. 2 However, before initiation of statin therapy for primary prevention, the ACC/AHA guideline emphasized a clinician‐patient risk discussion. Although guidance has been published 3 detailing elements of discussions, little is known about how such discussions are currently being implemented in clinical practice or whether specific practices are associated with statin prescription.

Although the ACC/AHA guideline expanded the population eligible for statin therapy and recommended potentially higher doses of statin therapy for primary and secondary prevention, evidence to date indicates modest adoption in clinical practice. 4, 5, 6, 7 One study evaluated statin use in 161 cardiology practices before and after the ACC/AHA guideline, finding no significant difference in trends of use of moderate‐ to high‐intensity statins for eligible subgroups, with postguideline primary prevention use of 55.2% for diabetic patients and 46.9% for patients with no clinical ASCVD but elevated ASCVD risk. 8 A study using a national database of pharmacy and medical claims found that the ACC/AHA guideline publication was associated with a decrease in statin initiation. 9

Given that the current ACC/AHA guideline represented a substantial change in the approach to cholesterol management while also promoting individualized decision making, it is likely that clinician and patient beliefs impact decision making. The purpose of this study is to improve our understanding of the implementation of the ACC/AHA guideline from the perspective of primary care providers (PCPs), potentially helping to explain patterns of uptake as well as to identify potential barriers and solutions. We hypothesized that community PCPs hold varying beliefs of the risks and benefits of statin therapy and report varying approaches to statin risk discussions with patients. We further hypothesized that the following PCP survey responses, pertaining to recommended elements of informed discussions, would be associated with increased statin prescription for primary prevention: (1) greater reported statin efficacy; (2) fewer number of adverse effects believed to be caused by statins; (3) lower reported deviation from the guidelines because of other cardiovascular risk factors; and (4) lower reported discordance between PCP recommendations and patient preferences.

### Individualized dose-response to statins associated with cardiovascular disease outcomes [^53e3321d]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Current standards of care rely on clinical risk factors to inform choice of statin intensity, and our findings regarding the impact of dose-response traits on ASCVD outcomes suggest that approaches to statin therapy could be further refined by incorporating ED 50 and E max into automated clinical decision support if/when these traits are more readily available. Deidentified EHRs provide a rich repository of real-world, practice-based clinical data that can be utilized for applications of pharmacogenetic research, including investigations of dose-response that are not feasible in the clinical trial setting. Furthermore, data from routine care may better reflect the actualities of day-to-day clinical medicine because practice-based data contain the full width and breadth of demographic factors and relevant clinical comorbidities, while randomized trials apply numerous exclusions and control for as many elements as possible in order to resolve their specific desired endpoint.

Individualized statin dose-response

In this study, we demonstrate that dose-response traits describing the relationship between statin use — specifically atorvastatin, simvastatin, and rosuvastatin — and LDL-C changes can be obtained following data extraction of statin exposure events and LDL-C measurements from longitudinal clinical data. As anticipated, the order of potency was simvastatin < atorvastatin < rosuvastatin. Although estimated measures of efficacy represented by E max were similar across statin types, there was much more variability in the distribution of efficacy for simvastatin compared to atorvastatin or rosuvastatin, which aligns with prior studies finding that some patients are unable to reduce LDL-C to the desired target despite dose escalation and close follow-up. From our results, atorvastatin and rosuvastatin exhibit the most consistent lipid-lowering effect, and this finding supports the use of these statin agents as high-intensity statins for primary and secondary prevention of ASCVD.

### Statins for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease [^853a9ff4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Reducing high blood cholesterol, a risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) events in people with and without a past history of CVD is an important goal of pharmacotherapy. Statins are the first-choice agents. Previous reviews of the effects of statins have highlighted their benefits in people with CVD. The case for primary prevention was uncertain when the last version of this review was published (2011) and in light of new data an update of this review is required.

Objectives

To assess the effects, both harms and benefits, of statins in people with no history of CVD.

Search Methods

To avoid duplication of effort, we checked reference lists of previous systematic reviews. The searches conducted in 2007 were updated in January 2012. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library (2022, Issue 4), MEDLINE OVID (1950 to December Week 4 2011) and EMBASE OVID (1980 to 2012 Week 1). There were no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials of statins versus placebo or usual care control with minimum treatment duration of one year and follow-up of six months, in adults with no restrictions on total, low density lipoprotein (LDL) or high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels, and where 10% or less had a history of CVD.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected studies for inclusion and extracted data. Outcomes included all-cause mortality, fatal and non-fatal CHD, CVD and stroke events, combined endpoints (fatal and non-fatal CHD, CVD and stroke events), revascularisation, change in total and LDL cholesterol concentrations, adverse events, quality of life and costs. Odds ratios (OR) and risk ratios (RR) were calculated for dichotomous data, and for continuous data, pooled mean differences (MD) (with 95% confidence intervals (CI)) were calculated. We contacted trial authors to obtain missing data.

Main Results

The latest search found four new trials and updated follow-up data on three trials included in the original review. Eighteen randomised control trials (19 trial arms; 56,934 participants) were included. Fourteen trials recruited patients with specific conditions (raised lipids, diabetes, hypertension, microalbuminuria). All-cause mortality was reduced by statins (OR 0.86, 95% CI 0.79 to 0.94); as was combined fatal and non-fatal CVD RR 0.75 (95% CI 0.70 to 0.81), combined fatal and non-fatal CHD events RR 0.73 (95% CI 0.67 to 0.80) and combined fatal and non-fatal stroke (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.89). Reduction of revascularisation rates (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.72) was also seen. Total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol were reduced in all trials but there was evidence of heterogeneity of effects. There was no evidence of any serious harm caused by statin prescription. Evidence available to date showed that primary prevention with statins is likely to be cost-effective and may improve patient quality of life. Recent findings from the Cholesterol Treatment Trialists study using individual patient data meta-analysis indicate that these benefits are similar in people at lower (< 1% per year) risk of a major cardiovascular event.

Authors' Conclusions

Reductions in all-cause mortality, major vascular events and revascularisations were found with no excess of adverse events among people without evidence of CVD treated with statins.

### Low-dose aspirin for the prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease [^743fc69c]. European Heart Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

The apparent numerical difference in relative risk reductions observed in primary (typically, 10% to 12% reduction) and secondary (typically, 20% to 25% reduction) prevention trials is most likely explained by the much longer duration of the former (6.9 years) than the latter (2.5 years)and time-dependent loss of compliance with trial medication.

Strengths of the evidence for the antithrombotic efficacy of low-dose aspirin are related to the number, sample size, and duration of placebo-controlled RCTs across the whole spectrum of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk. Potential limitations are represented by the time frame over which this evidence accumulated, prior to the development of coronary revascularization and other pharmacological preventive strategies (e.g. statins). Such improvements in treatment and prevention would be expected to reduce the baseline risk of serious vascular events and therefore the absolute benefits of aspirin addition. However, revascularization and statin therapy are unlikely to modify the relative risk reduction associated with aspirin use, if its benefits are additive to those of other strategies, as would be expected by their different mechanisms of action.

Statin therapy was associated with decreased risk of all-cause mortality (risk ratio [RR], 0.86 [95% CI, 0.80 to 0.93]; I2 = 0%; absolute risk difference [ARD], -0.40% [95% CI, -0.64% to -0.17%]), cardiovascular mortality (RR, 0.69 [95% CI, 0.54 to 0.88]; I2 = 54%; ARD, -0.43% [95% CI, -0.75% to -0.11%]), stroke (RR, 0.71 [95% CI, 0.62 to 0.82]; I2 = 0; ARD, -0.38% [95% CI, -0.53% to -0.23%]), myocardial infarction (RR, 0.64 [95% CI, 0.57 to 0.71]; I2 = 0%; ARD, -0.81% [95% CI, -1.19 to -0.43%]), and composite cardiovascular outcomes (RR, 0.70 [95% CI, 0.63 to 0.78]; I2 = 36%; ARD, -1.39% [95% CI, -1.79 to -0.99%]). Relative benefits appeared consistent in demographic and clinical subgroups, including populations without marked hyperlipidemia (total cholesterol level < 200 mg/dL); absolute benefits were higher in subgroups at higher baseline risk. Statins were not associated with increased risk of serious adverse events (RR, 0.99 [95% CI, 0.94 to 1.04]), myalgias (RR, 0.96 [95% CI, 0.79 to 1.16]), or liver-related harms (RR, 1.10 [95% CI, 0.90 to 1.35]). In pooled analysis, statins were not associated with increased risk of diabetes (RR, 1.05 [95% CI, 0.91 to 1.20]), although statistical heterogeneity was present (I2 = 52%), and 1 trial found high-intensity statins associated with increased risk (RR, 1.25 [95% CI, 1.05 to 1.49]). No trial directly compared titrated vs fixed-dose statins, and there were no clear differences based on statin intensity.

Conclusions and Relevance

In adults at increased CVD risk but without prior CVD events, statin therapy was associated with reduced risk of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality and CVD events, with greater absolute benefits in patients at greater baseline risk.

### The effect of statin therapy on heart failure events: a collaborative meta-analysis of unpublished data from major randomized trials [^6cb8141a]. European Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Methods

Data sources and searches

We collected data from major randomized controlled trials designed to assess the effect of statins on cardiovascular outcomes. We searched Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials with the terms 'statin' and 'HMG CoA reductase inhibitor', plus individual statin names as title or keywords, on 25th March 2014.

Study selection

We limited the search to trials of adults, published in the English language, between 1 January 1994 and 1 January 2014. We included placebo controlled, standard care-controlled, and intensive vs. moderate dose trials in primary prevention, secondary-prevention, and mixed primary- and secondary-prevention populations. We excluded trials conducted entirely in participants with HF, dialysis, or organ transplant populations, those with < 1000 enrolled participants, trials with a mean follow-up of < 1 year, trials of combination therapy, and trials assessing surrogate markers of cardiovascular disease. Study protocol and data request sheets were sent to investigators from the relevant trials as described below to collect unpublished data. A specific definition of HF events was not provided to the contributing investigators.

Conclusion

The safe and optimal treatment of plasma lipids within the secondary prevention population is key to reducing the increasing burden of CVD in society. However, given the paucity of evidence for the frequency of ongoing monitoring, there is a clear need for further research in these two key areas of its management. This will improve patient care while optimising costs in an evidence-based manner.

Policy implications

The low risk of adverse events caused by statins reported in this review should reassure patients and physicians that the potential harms of statins are small and should not deter their use for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease. In particular, given the observed benefits of treatment in preventing major cardiovascular events, the slightly increased risk of self-reported muscle symptoms, which have no confirmed effect on physiological function, should not delay starting treatment with statins. For patients who do have muscle symptoms after treatment with statins, these data highlight that, in most cases, the symptoms are unlikely to be caused by treatment with statins alone. Physicians should therefore look at patients' misconceptions of intolerance to statins and perhaps consider providing behavioural interventions, such as n-of-1 trials, to minimise unnecessary withdrawal of treatment.

The increased risk of liver dysfunction with statins suggests that routine monitoring of liver function during treatment is probably warranted in primary prevention, as recommended by the manufacturers in the statin product information. The current trial data do not support tailoring the type of statin or dosage to reduce adverse events in patients taking statins for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease.

To help improve adherence to statin treatment, studies are needed to identify patient characteristics that are crucial to these small risks of adverse events, which could be based on individual level data in clinical practice. These studies would also help with more targeted treatment and achieve more efficient monitoring. Future studies might also determine the associations of statins with more severe, long term adverse events, probably with observational and pharmacovigilance data from large populations, which might facilitate the detection of rare adverse events.

Conclusions

Statins were associated with a small increased risk of self-reported muscle symptoms, liver dysfunction, renal insufficiency, and eye conditions in patients without a history of cardiovascular disease. These adverse effects were mild compared with the potential benefits of treatment with statins in preventing major cardiovascular events, suggesting that the benefit-to-harm balance of statins for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease is generally favourable. Evidence that these adverse effects varied by type or dosage of statins was limited, and therefore tailoring statin regimens before starting treatment to deal with concerns about safety is not currently supported.

### 2013 ACC / AHA guideline recommends fixed-dose strategies instead of targeted goals to lower blood cholesterol [^73010106]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

The American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) Task Force on Practice Guidelines recently issued the 2013 ACC/AHA Guideline on the Treatment of Blood Cholesterol to Reduce Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Risk in Adults. This new guideline endorses a paradigm shift in strategies for reducing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events by lowering blood cholesterol. Whereas previous guidelines focused on therapy to decrease low-density lipoprotein and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol to specific target levels, the new guideline instead proposes implementation of cholesterol-lowering treatment using evidenced-based intensity of statin therapy without such targets. The guideline also provides a new risk estimator for primary prevention decisions, including stroke outcomes and data on African Americans, which will significantly increase the number of patients recommended for outcome-related benefits of cholesterol-lowering therapy. The first section of this paper reviews the process by which the task force developed the new evidence-based guideline, the major findings and recommendations, and their implications. The second section primarily focuses on the question of how much low-density lipoprotein cholesterol should be lowered and on additional considerations in risk assessment.

### Lipid-lowering therapy in patients with high cardiovascular risk: dose or combination? [^2f60983a]. Clinical Therapeutics (2017). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in the world. Dyslipidemia, manifested by elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels, is central to the development and progression of atherosclerosis. Dyslipidemia has become a primary target of intervention in strategies for the prevention of cardiovascular events. Therapeutic lifestyle changes, such as increased physical activity, weight loss, smoking cessation, and adoption of a healthier diet, are effectively reducing cardiovascular risk in primary and secondary prevention. The combination therapy lowered LDL-C levels and achieved the LDL-C target in patients with high cardiovascular risk.

Key Points for Practice
- In primary prevention, moderate-dose statins are recommended when treatment is indicated.
- In secondary prevention, moderate-dose statins are recommended with intensification by increasing statin dose, adding ezetimibe, or adding a PCSK9 inhibitor in higher-risk patients.
- Because cholesterol values are stable over 10 years, new measurements are not needed for each risk assessment. Primary Prevention Without known cardiovascular disease, treatment decisions should be based on estimated 10-year risk calculators such as the pooled cohort equations. Treatment is recommended at a 10-year risk of 12%, which matches the populations that experienced benefit in clinical trials. People with diabetes mellitus and/or low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels of at least 190 mg per dL are also at high risk and should be offered treatment regardless of estimated risk.

Shared decision-making is recommended with 10-year risk between 6% and 12%, which represents populations less studied in clinical trials. Moderate-dose statins are the sole medication recommended for primary prevention. The group recommends against high-dose statins, citing lack of additional benefit and an increase in risks. The guideline does not suggest one statin over another. Because moderate dosing is recommended for all patients, the guideline does not recommend titrating dosage to a specific cholesterol level. There is no evidence that ezetimibe, proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors, icosapent ethyl, fibrates, bempedoic acid, or niacin is beneficial in primary prevention. Secondary Prevention Patients with known coronary artery disease are at high enough risk to require treatment. Moderate-dose statins are the baseline in this group because no other treatment has a greater impact on mortality.

The guideline recommends considering more intense treatment, especially in higher-risk patients. High-dose statin therapy reduced major cardiovascular events in the higher-risk patients studied. Adding ezetimibe to moderate- or high-dose statins reduces non-fatal cardiovascular events to a similar extent as high-dose statins. PCSK9 inhibitors also decrease nonfatal cardiovascular events in high-risk individuals on maximal tolerated therapy to a similar extent. Because of high cost and uncertain long-term safety, PCSK9 inhibitors are recommended only after increasing statin dose and adding ezetimibe.

### Perils of observational data analyses [^086277ba]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Prevention guidelines around the world recommend statin therapy for the secondary and primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). 1, 2, 3 Recommendations are based on data from > 185 000 participants enrolled in over 28 statin cardiovascular outcomes trials. 4 However, the vast majority of statin trials were performed in white populations in the United States and Europe, with few trials including a majority of Asian ancestry participants.

In this issue of the Journal of the American Heart Association (JAHA), Park et al attempt to address an important safety issue that could influence the potential for net benefit from statin therapy in Korean primary prevention patients. 5 They used the Korean national health insurance healthcare database to identify over 2 million adults with total cholesterol levels ≥ 240 mg/dL who were eligible for primary prevention statin therapy. With a new user design of this database, Park et al identified > 500 000 propensity‐matched pairs of statin users and nonusers. They found that ever‐statin users were more likely to have been diagnosed with diabetes mellitus over a 3.9‐year period (hazard ratio [HR] 1.88, 95% CI 1.85–1.93) than never‐statin users. They also found that the risk of diabetes mellitus was higher with increasing duration of statin use (1‐year HR 1.26, 1–2 years HR 2.22, and > 2 years HR 2.62, all compared with < 1 year). Higher intensity statin therapy and higher daily dose were also associated with higher risk of new‐onset diabetes mellitus.

### Niacin and heart disease prevention: engraving its tombstone is a mistake [^5b0f629d]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2017). Low credibility.

Niacin (nicotinic acid) has been used for primary and secondary coronary heart disease prevention for over 40 years. Until recently clinical trials incorporating niacin as part of an intervention strategy consistently demonstrated reduction in clinical events and lesion improvement, including ≥ 6% absolute mortality reduction. Two large clinical event trials in 2011 (Atherothrombosis Intervention in Metabolic Syndrome With Low HDL/High Triglycerides and Impact on Global Health Outcomes) and 2014 (Heart Protection Study 2-Treatment of HDL to Reduce the Incidence of Vascular Events) concluded that niacin added to statin therapy did not provide clinical event benefit over statin alone. This has prompted some individuals to call for an end to the use of niacin in statin-treated patients and the US Food and Drug Administration to halt marketing of statin/niacin combination tablets. There are significant differences between the earlier clinical trials that revealed cardiovascular benefit of niacin and the 2 trials that failed to demonstrate a benefit. These differences include dyslipidemia types, niacin formulation, dosing, and timing. In general, the patient population that benefits the most from incorporating niacin in their treatment regimen can be defined by elevations in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides, and reduced high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. The niacin formulation and dose should be capable of achieving adequate lipoprotein change. Mealtime dosing of niacin, as opposed to bedtime dosing, may avoid a counter-regulatory hormone response, including catecholamines, because of altered fuel supply potentially leading to unexpected cardiovascular outcomes.

### Evolving management of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol: a personalized approach to preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease across the risk continuum [^1d011761]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Management of elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is central to preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and key to reducing the risk of ASCVD events. Current guidelines on the management of blood cholesterol recommend statins as first-line therapy for LDL-C reduction according to an individual's ASCVD risk and baseline LDL-C levels. The addition of nonstatin lipid-lowering therapy to statins to achieve intensive LDL-C lowering is recommended for patients at very high risk of ASCVD events, including patients with familial hypercholesterolemia who have not achieved adequate LDL-C lowering with statins alone. Despite guideline recommendations and clinical trial evidence to support the use of lipid-lowering therapies for ASCVD risk reduction, most patients at high or very high risk do not meet LDL-C thresholds. This review explores the challenges associated with LDL-C lowering in contemporary clinical practice and proposes a framework for rethinking the binary definition of ASCVD, shifting from "primary" versus "secondary" prevention to a "continuum of risk". The approach considers the role of plaque burden and progression in subclinical disease and emphasizes the importance of early risk assessment and treatment for preventing first cardiovascular events. Patients at high risk of ASCVD events who require significant LDL-C lowering should be considered for combination therapies comprising statin and nonstatin agents. Practical guidance for the pharmacological management of elevated LDL-C, both now and in the future, is provided.

### High-dose atorvastatin vs usual-dose simvastatin for secondary prevention after myocardial infarction: the IDEAL study: a randomized controlled trial [^afa873a5]. JAMA (2005). Excellent credibility.

Context

Evidence suggests that more intensive lowering of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) than is commonly applied clinically will provide further benefit in stable coronary artery disease.

Objective

To compare the effects of 2 strategies of lipid lowering on the risk of cardiovascular disease among patients with a previous myocardial infarction (MI).

Design, Setting, and Participants

The IDEAL study, a prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded end-point evaluation trial conducted at 190 ambulatory cardiology care and specialist practices in northern Europe between March 1999 and March 2005 with a median follow-up of 4.8 years, which enrolled 8888 patients aged 80 years or younger with a history of acute MI.

Interventions

Patients were randomly assigned to receive a high dose of atorvastatin (80 mg/d; n = 4439), or usual-dose simvastatin (20 mg/d; n = 4449).

Main Outcome Measure

Occurrence of a major coronary event, defined as coronary death, confirmed nonfatal acute MI, or cardiac arrest with resuscitation.

Results

During treatment, mean LDL-C levels were 104 (SE, 0.3) mg/dL in the simvastatin group and 81 (SE, 0.3) mg/dL in the atorvastatin group. A major coronary event occurred in 463 simvastatin patients (10.4%) and in 411 atorvastatin patients (9.3%) (hazard ratio [HR], 0.89; 95% CI, 0.78–1.01; P = 0.07). Nonfatal acute MI occurred in 321 (7.2%) and 267 (6.0%) in the 2 groups (HR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.71–0.98; P = 0.02), but no differences were seen in the 2 other components of the primary end point. Major cardiovascular events occurred in 608 and 533 in the 2 groups, respectively (HR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.77–0.98; P = 0.02). Occurrence of any coronary event was reported in 1059 simvastatin and 898 atorvastatin patients (HR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.76–0.91; P < .001). Noncardiovascular death occurred in 156 (3.5%) and 143 (3.2%) in the 2 groups (HR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.73–1.15; P = 0.47). Death from any cause occurred in 374 (8.4%) in the simvastatin group and 366 (8.2%) in the atorvastatin group (HR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.85–1.13; P = 0.81). Patients in the atorvastatin group had higher rates of drug discontinuation due to nonserious adverse events; transaminase elevation resulted in 43 (1.0%) vs 5 (0.1%) withdrawals (P < .001). Serious myopathy and rhabdomyolysis were rare in both groups.

Conclusions

In this study of patients with previous MI, intensive lowering of LDL-C did not result in a significant reduction in the primary outcome of major coronary events, but did reduce the risk of other composite secondary end points and nonfatal acute MI. There were no differences in cardiovascular or all-cause mortality. Patients with MI may benefit from intensive lowering of LDL-C without an increase in noncardiovascular mortality or other serious adverse reactions. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00159835.

and 3 large cohort studies. 1, 2 The evidence review found that statin therapy use in patients for primary prevention was associated with reductions in all-cause mortality, fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction, fatal or nonfatal stroke, revascularization, and the composite cardiovascular outcome. 1, 2 Insufficient data were available for older adults, especially individuals older than 75 years. Importantly, the evidence review did not find any significant harm associated with statin therapy, suggesting a significant overall net benefit in primary prevention in appropriate groups of individuals. 1, 2. The evidence review2 led to 3 clinical recommendations1 that are consistent with the 2016 USPSTF recommendations on this topic. A B statement was made that clinicians initiate statins for primary prevention in adults aged 40 to 75 years with at least 1 CVD risk factor and a calculated 10-year CVD event risk 10% or greater.

For example, the 10-year hard ASCVD event rates in 3 trials of pure primary prevention showed benefits of statin therapy ranging from 5. 1% to
7. 6%. 4 Indeed, statin therapy shows efficacy at even lower 10-year ASCVD risk levels, and there is some indication that the relative benefits of statin therapy may be higher among individuals with lower 10-year ASCVD risk. 5 For most therapies, treating individuals with lower ASCVD risk comes at a price of treating a large number of individuals for a longer period of time. Most patients who initiate preventive therapies use those therapies for a much longer period of time. It is important to note that although most RCTs of statin therapy by design only evaluated a first ASCVD event, preventive therapies also are associated with reduced risk of second and subsequent cardiovascular events.

The disability associated with first and subsequent myocardial infarction or stroke is not fully captured in these RCTs, given their short follow-up, but is extremely important to patients. Fourth, clinicians should consider titrating the intensity of therapy to the risk of the individual. Therefore, patients who belong to high-risk primary prevention groups may derive further benefit from the use of high-intensity statin therapy.

Recommendations for adults with high blood cholesterol — risk-based statin therapy are as follows: "In adults at intermediate risk (≥ 7.5% to < 20% 10-year ASCVD risk), statin therapy reduces risk of ASCVD, and in the context of a risk discussion, if a decision is made for statin therapy, a moderate-intensity statin should be recommended". Targets are specified: "In intermediate risk (≥ 7.5% to < 20% 10-year ASCVD risk) patients, LDL-C levels should be reduced by 30% or more", and "in patients at high risk (≥ 20% 10-year ASCVD risk), levels should be reduced by 50% or more". Diabetes-specific guidance states: "In adults 40 to 75 years of age with diabetes, regardless of estimated 10-year ASCVD risk, moderate-intensity statin therapy is indicated", and "In adults with diabetes mellitus who have multiple ASCVD risk factors, it is reasonable to prescribe high-intensity statin therapy with the aim to reduce LDL-C levels by 50% or more". For very high LDL-C, "In patients 20 to 75 years of age with an LDL-C level of 190 mg/dL (≥ 4.9 mmol/L) or higher, maximally tolerated statin therapy is recommended".

Brief review of cholesterol guidelines

The management of hypercholesterolemia has undergone significant evolution since the first major U.S. national cholesterol guidelines were introduced in 1988. This progress has been driven by the advent of statin therapy and numerous clinical trials demonstrating substantial reductions in cardiovascular events. A brief review of the most recent international guidelines is essential. These include the 2018 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology (AHA/ACC) multisociety guidelines, with subsequent updates reflected in the 2021 and 2022 ACC Expert Consensus Decision Pathways (ECDPs) on hypertriglyceridemiaand nonstatin therapies, respectively; the 2019 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines; and the 2021 Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS) guidelines. Table 2, provides an overview of the guidelines.

Table 2
Comparison of Recent International Cholesterol Statements

Two of the most significant differences across these guidelines are the approach to risk classification and treatment.

The AHA/ACC and CCS guidelines make an initial distinction between primary and secondary prevention; the AHA/ACC guidelines also separately provide recommendations for those with diabetes and severe hypercholesterolemia (LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL). In contrast, the ESC guidelines delineate patients from those with established ASCVD to those with low-calculate 10-year risk; however the guideline does make note of primary and secondary prevention in discussions of treatment.

In regard to treatment and nonstatin use, the ESC overall is more aggressive in LDL-C treatment thresholds and recommends LDL-C ≤ 55 mg/dL for all secondary and very-high-risk primary prevention patients. In contrast, the AHA/ACA guidelines reserve this for very-high-risk secondary prevention patients. Similarly, treating to LDL-C ≤ 70 mg/dL is recommended for a wide group of patients in ESC guidance.

In terms of therapeutic options, the biggest divergence is on the use of PCSK9 inhibitors. These are recommended for secondary and select primary prevention patients in ESC guidelinesalthough it is noteworthy that evidence of benefit in nonsecondary prevention and non-FH patients is lacking although clinical trials are ongoing. In contrast, use is limited in the ACC ECDP to secondary-prevention patients and those with likely FH.

### Statin use and adverse effects among adults > 75 Years of age: insights from the patient and provider assessment of lipid management (PALM) registry [^88005326]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Current statin use and symptoms among older adults in routine community practice have not been well characterized since the release of the 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guideline.

Methods and Results

We compared statin use and dosing between adults > 75 and ≤ 75 years old who were eligible for primary or secondary prevention statin use without considering guideline-recommended age criteria. The patients were treated at 138 US practices in the Patient and Provider Assessment of Lipid Management (PALM) registry in 2015. Patient surveys also evaluated reported symptoms while taking statins. Multivariable logistic regression models examined the association between older age and statin use and dosing. Among 6717 people enrolled, 1704 (25%) were > 75 years old. For primary prevention, use of any statin or high-dose statin did not vary by age group: any statin, 62.6% in those > 75 years old versus 63.1% in those ≤ 75 years old (P = 0.83); high-dose statin, 10.2% versus 12.3% in the same groups (P = 0.14). For secondary prevention, older patients were slightly less likely to receive any statin (80.1% versus 84.2% [P = 0.003]; adjusted odds ratio, 0.81; 95% confidence interval, 0.66–1.01 [P = 0.06]), but were much less likely to receive a high-intensity statin (23.5% versus 36.2% [P < 0.0001]; adjusted odds ratio, 0.54; 95% confidence interval, 0.45–0.65 [P = 0.0001]). Among current statin users, older patients were slightly less likely to report any symptoms (41.3% versus 46.6%; P = 0.003) or myalgias (27.3% versus 33.3%; P < 0.001).

Conclusions

Overall use of statins was similar for primary prevention in those aged > 75 years versus younger patients, yet older patients were less likely to receive high-intensity statins for secondary prevention. Statins appear to be similarly tolerated in older and younger adults.

### Disparities in guideline-recommended statin use for prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease by race, ethnicity, and gender: a nationally representative cross-sectional analysis of adults in the United States [^23f3e8b8]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Although statins are a class I recommendation for prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and its complications, their use is suboptimal. Differential underuse may mediate disparities in cardiovascular health for systematically marginalized persons.

Objective

To estimate disparities in statin use by race-ethnicity-gender and to determine whether these potential disparities are explained by medical appropriateness of therapy and structural factors.

Design

Cross-sectional analysis.

Setting

National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from 2015 to 2020.

Participants

Persons eligible for statin therapy based on 2013 and 2018 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association blood cholesterol guidelines.

Measurements

The independent variable was race-ethnicity-gender. The outcome of interest was use of a statin. Using the Institute of Medicine framework for examining unequal treatment, we calculated adjusted prevalence ratios (aPRs) to estimate disparities in statin use adjusted for age, disease severity, access to health care, and socioeconomic status relative to non-Hispanic White men.

Results

For primary prevention, we identified a lower prevalence of statin use that was not explained by measurable differences in disease severity or structural factors among non-Hispanic Black men (aPR, 0.73 [95% CI, 0.59 to 0.88]) and non-Mexican Hispanic women (aPR, 0.74 [CI, 0.53 to 0.95]). For secondary prevention, we identified a lower prevalence of statin use that was not explained by measurable differences in disease severity or structural factors for non-Hispanic Black men (aPR, 0.81 [CI, 0.64 to 0.97]), other/multiracial men (aPR, 0.58 [CI, 0.20 to 0.97]), Mexican American women (aPR, 0.36 [CI, 0.10 to 0.61]), non-Mexican Hispanic women (aPR, 0.57 [CI, 0.33 to 0.82), non-Hispanic White women (aPR, 0.69 [CI, 0.56 to 0.83]), and non-Hispanic Black women (aPR, 0.75 [CI, 0.57 to 0.92]).

Limitation

Cross-sectional data; lack of geographic, language, or statin-dose data.

Conclusion

Statin use disparities for several race-ethnicity-gender groups are not explained by measurable differences in medical appropriateness of therapy, access to health care, and socioeconomic status. These residual disparities may be partially mediated by unobserved processes that contribute to health inequity, including bias, stereotyping, and mistrust.

### Niacin for primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular events [^2abc8e25]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Nicotinic acid (niacin) is known to decrease LDL-cholesterol, and triglycerides, and increase HDL-cholesterol levels. The evidence of benefits with niacin monotherapy or add-on to statin-based therapy is controversial.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of niacin therapy versus placebo, administered as monotherapy or add-on to statin-based therapy in people with or at risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in terms of mortality, CVD events, and side effects.

Search Methods

Two reviewers independently and in duplicate screened records and potentially eligible full texts identified through electronic searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, two trial registries, and reference lists of relevant articles (latest search in August 2016).

Selection Criteria

We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that either compared niacin monotherapy to placebo/usual care or niacin in combination with other component versus other component alone. We considered RCTs that administered niacin for at least six months, reported a clinical outcome, and included adults with or without established CVD.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers used pre-piloted forms to independently and in duplicate extract trials characteristics, risk of bias items, and outcomes data. Disagreements were resolved by consensus or third party arbitration. We conducted random-effects meta-analyses, sensitivity analyses based on risk of bias and different assumptions for missing data, and used meta-regression analyses to investigate potential relationships between treatment effects and duration of treatment, proportion of participants with established coronary heart disease and proportion of participants receiving background statin therapy. We used GRADE to assess the quality of evidence.

Main Results

We included 23 RCTs that were published between 1968 and 2015 and included 39,195 participants in total. The mean age ranged from 33 to 71 years. The median duration of treatment was 11.5 months, and the median dose of niacin was 2 g/day. The proportion of participants with prior myocardial infarction ranged from 0% (4 trials) to 100% (2 trials, median proportion 48%); the proportion of participants taking statin ranged from 0% (4 trials) to 100% (12 trials, median proportion 100%). Using available cases, niacin did not reduce overall mortality (risk ratio (RR) 1.05, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.97 to 1.12; participants = 35,543; studies = 12; I² = 0%; high-quality evidence), cardiovascular mortality (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.12; participants = 32,966; studies = 5; I² = 0%; moderate-quality evidence), non-cardiovascular mortality (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.28; participants = 32,966; studies = 5; I² = 0%; high-quality evidence), the number of fatal or non-fatal myocardial infarctions (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.00; participants = 34,829; studies = 9; I² = 0%; moderate-quality evidence), nor the number of fatal or non-fatal strokes (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.22; participants = 33,661; studies = 7; I² = 42%; low-quality evidence). Participants randomised to niacin were more likely to discontinue treatment due to side effects than participants randomised to control group (RR 2.17, 95% CI 1.70 to 2.77; participants = 33,539; studies = 17; I² = 77%; moderate-quality evidence). The results were robust to sensitivity analyses using different assumptions for missing data.

Authors' Conclusions

Moderate- to high-quality evidence suggests that niacin does not reduce mortality, cardiovascular mortality, non-cardiovascular mortality, the number of fatal or non-fatal myocardial infarctions, nor the number of fatal or non-fatal strokes but is associated with side effects. Benefits from niacin therapy in the prevention of cardiovascular disease events are unlikely.

### Systematic review of clinical guidelines for lipid lowering in the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease events [^ff826769]. Open Heart (2020). Medium credibility.

The evidence that 'lower is better' for LDL and non-HDL cholesterol in terms of secondary CVD prevention is well supported by evidence, and the recent advent of PCSK9 inhibitors further supports this notion. The issue at hand is how to use this information clinically to support a testing regimen. In this regard, the use of cholesterol targets for therapy is contentious, in part because the evidence for their use is less strong. While research has shown that achieving targets is associated with better outcomes, no specific randomised controlled trial has shown that randomising patients to a target improves adherence or event rates. Indeed, it might be argued that the maximally tolerated statin should be initiated as the default, and therefore a hard target may be moot. Clearly, other lipid-lowering medications could be added to therapy. Despite the lack of strong evidence, many guidelines recommended specific lipid targets, with many choosing similar values, suggesting that guideline committees are likely to be examining the same evidence. However, one of the most recently published guidelines, the 2019 ESC/EAS Guidelines for the Management of Dyslipidaemias (ESCEAS) advised the lowest cholesterol targets of all the included guidelines (LDL < 1.4 mmol/L), with further lower levels for those with multiple recent cardiovascular events (LDL < 1.0 mmol/L). This was rated as being supported by strong and moderate levels of evidence, although the guidelines acknowledged that both targets are based on the LDL levels achieved in the trials for PCSK9 inhibitors.

### A point-by-point response to recent arguments against the use of statins in primary prevention: this statement is endorsed by the American Society for Preventive Cardiology [^4d75e429]. Clinical Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

Recently, a debate over the merits of statin therapy in primary prevention was published in the Wall Street Journal. The statin opponent claimed that statins should only be used in secondary prevention and never in any primary-prevention patients at risk for cardiovascular events. In this evidence-based rebuttal to those claims, we review the evidence supporting the efficacy of statin therapy in primary prevention. Cardiovascular risk is a continuum in which those at an elevated risk of events stand to benefit from early initiation of therapy. Statins should not be reserved until after a patient suffers the catastrophic consequences of atherosclerosis. Contrary to the assertions of the statin opponent, this principle has been demonstrated through reductions in heart attacks, strokes, and mortality in numerous randomized controlled primary-prevention statin trials. Furthermore, data show that once a patient tolerates the initial treatment period, the few side effects that subsequently emerge are largely reversible. Accordingly, every major guidelines committee endorses statin use in secondary prevention and selectively in primary prevention for those with risk factors. The foundation for prevention remains increased physical activity, better dietary habits, and smoking cessation. However, prevention of heart attacks, strokes, and death from cardiovascular disease does not have to be all or none-all statin or all lifestyle. In selected at-risk individuals, the combination of pharmacotherapy and lifestyle changes is more effective than either alone. Future investigation in prevention should focus on improving our ability to identify these at-risk individuals.

### Evaluation of statin prescribing for secondary prevention in primary care following new guideline recommendations [^07e074fc]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) Guideline on the Treatment of Blood Cholesterol recommends high-intensity statin therapy for most patients with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) versus previously recommended low-density lipoprotein cholesterol targets. The impact of the ACC/AHA guidelines on prescribing patterns in primary care is uncertain.

Objective

To describe the prescribing habits of statin therapy in primary care patients with ASCVD before and after the ACC/AHA guidelines were published.

Methods

This retrospective observational study evaluated patients with ASCVD who were seen in at least 1 of 8 primary care clinics in the University of Colorado Health system. It received expedited approval by the Colorado Multiple Institutional Review Board. The primary outcome measure was the proportion of patients with established ASCVD prescribed high-intensity statin therapy within 1 year before or after guideline release.

Results

In total, 220 patients were included in the analysis with 110 in the before and 110 in the after cohort. For the primary outcome analysis, the rate of high-intensity statin utilization in the before versus after groups was significantly greater (25.5% vs 41.8%, P = 0.01). For ages 76 to 89 years, 36 of 37 and 29 of 30 patients in the before and after groups were receiving moderate- to high-intensity statin therapy (97.3% vs 96.7%, P = 0.99). Subgroup analysis in the after cohort for all ages showed no change in statin therapy for 77% of patients.

Conclusions

High-intensity statin prescribing increased in patients with ASCVD after release of the ACC/AHA cholesterol guidelines. Our data indicate that national evidence-based guidelines may influence clinical practice in very high risk patients.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 1 – full report [^f8de5456]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

Statin therapy for ASCVD risk reduction — For patients in whom lipid-lowering drug therapy is indicated, statin treatment is the primary modality for reducing ASCVD risk. Statins have been shown to reduce serum LDL-C levels by 18% to 55%, non–HDL-C by 15% to 51%, and triglycerides by 7% to 30% (in hypertriglyceridemia the reduction is typically by 20% to 50%, particularly with high-potency statins) and increase HDL-C by 5% to 15%. A large body of RCT evidence demonstrates that statins are safe and generally well tolerated by most patients and that they decrease risk for ASCVD events in both primary and secondary prevention in amounts proportional to their cholesterol lowering, and for these reasons, they are considered to be first-line drug treatment in both primary and secondary prevention of ASCVD.

### Statin use and adverse effects among adults > 75 Years of age: insights from the patient and provider assessment of lipid management (PALM) registry [^afa4319d]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

Patients > 75 years have been poorly represented in large primary and secondary ASCVD prevention statin trials. Consequently, the ACC/AHA and more recent US Preventive Services Task Force guidelines do not recommend statins for primary prevention in older adults, although the former allows for risk discussion, while suggesting less intense therapy for secondary prevention. 1, 12 Despite a lack of evidence and firm treatment guidelines, clinicians need to make therapeutic decisions about lipid management in older patients. In our large, contemporary, practice‐based study, we found that many patients > 75 years in primary prevention are receiving a statin. What is unclear is whether physicians are extrapolating treatment algorithms used for their younger patients and applying these algorithms to their older patients, particularly for primary prevention. In the setting of primary prevention, older and younger patients had a similar likelihood of receiving statin therapy, including high‐intensity statin therapy. Nonetheless, in secondary prevention, physicians appeared to follow the ACC/AHA guidelines and prescribed lower‐dose statins in older individuals with ASCVD. Finally, relative to younger patients, we found that older individuals treated with any or high‐intensity statins specifically had similar likelihoods of having adverse symptoms as their similarly treated younger peers.

### Statin use for the primary prevention of cardiovascular… [^39266605]. AAFP (2017). Low credibility.

The USPSTF found adequate evidence that use of low- to moderate-dose statins reduces the probability of CVD events and mortality by at least a small amount in adults aged 40 to 75 years who have 1 or more CVD risk factors and a calculated 10-year CVD event risk of 7. 5% to 10%. The USPSTF found inadequate evidence to conclude whether initiating statin use in adults 76 years and older who are not already taking a statin is beneficial in reducing the incidence of CVD events and mortality. POTENTIAL HARMS OF STATIN USE The USPSTF found adequate evidence that the harms of low- to moderate-dose statin use in adults aged 40 to 75 years are small.

Randomized, clinical trials of statin use for the primary prevention of CVD events have largely used low and moderate doses; under these conditions, statin use was not associated with serious adverse events such as cancer, severely elevated liver enzyme levels, or severe muscle-related harms. The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that initiating use of low- to moderate-dose statins for the prevention of CVD events and mortality in adults aged 40 to 75 years without a history of CVD who have 1 or more CVD risk factors and a calculated 10-year CVD event risk of 7. 5% to 10% has a small net benefit. DOSAGE As previously noted, available RCTs evaluating statins for the prevention of CVD events largely used low and moderate doses. There were no clear differences in estimates of effect when the trials were stratified according to statin dose (see.

Limited information is available about use of high-dose statins in a primary prevention population. As such, the harms of statin use for the prevention of CVD events in adults aged 40 to 75 years can only be bounded as small for low- or moderate-dose statins. There may be individual clinical circumstances that warrant consideration of high-dose statin use; decisions about dose should be based on shared decision making between patients and clinicians. However, the most directly applicable body of evidence for patients without a history of CVD demonstrates benefits with use of low- to moderate-dose statins.

Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Randomized controlled trials — limitations and knowledge gaps: The guideline notes that greater reductions of LDL-C are accompanied by greater reductions in risk of ASCVD and that most RCT data are with statin therapy, with limited add-on nonstatin data, leading to several priority questions including thresholds and indications for PCSK9 inhibitor use and statin intensity comparisons in primary prevention. Key statements include: "They have established that greater reductions of LDL-C are accompanied by greater reductions in risk of ASCVD"; "Most of the data from RCTs have been obtained with statin therapy"; and questions such as "In secondary prevention, does a lower limit for LDL-C attainment exist, beyond which the incremental benefit attained is worth neither the risks nor the cost of additional therapy?", "In secondary prevention, what are the indications for adding PCSK9 inhibitors to maximal statin therapy?", "In primary prevention for adults 45 to 75 years of age (LDL-C < 90 mg/dL [< 2.3 mmol/L]) with or without diabetes mellitus, what is the incremental risk reduction imparted by high-intensity statins as compared with moderate-intensity statins?", "In primary prevention for adults 45 to 75 years of age (LDL-C < 190 mg/dL [< 4.9 mmol/L]) with or without diabetes mellitus, what is the incremental risk reduction imparted by moderate-intensity statins plus ezetimibe as compared with moderate-intensity statins alone?", and "Is statin therapy efficacious and safe in older patients (> 75 years of age)?".

Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Important research questions in cholesterol-lowering therapy — spanning secondary prevention, primary prevention, and statin/PCSK9/ezetimibe roles — are enumerated, including whether "a lower limit for LDL-C attainment" exists in secondary prevention and the "indications for adding PCSK9 inhibitors to maximal statin therapy". The questions also ask if, in ASCVD with "statin-associated side effects", PCSK9 inhibitors are "an effective and safe substitute for high-intensity statins", and, in primary prevention for adults "45 to 75 years of age (LDL-C < 90 mg/dL [< 2.3 mmol/L])" with or without diabetes, what "incremental risk reduction" is imparted by "high-intensity statins as compared with moderate-intensity statins". Further items address adults "45 to 75 years of age (LDL-C < 190 mg/dL [< 4.9 mmol/L])" comparing "moderate-intensity statins plus ezetimibe" versus "moderate-intensity statins alone", the efficacy and safety of statins in "older patients (> 75 years of age)", the "efficacy and net benefit of PCSK9 inhibitors as add-on treatment to maximal statin therapy" in severe hypercholesterolemia, and the efficacy of "moderate-intensity and high-intensity statin therapy in patients with risk-enhancing factors (eg, chronic inflammatory disease, CKD, metabolic syndrome)".

Table 2
Impact and Efficiency Estimates for Risk‐Targeted Versus Benefit‐Targeted Prescribing of Moderate‐Intensity Statins

A more‐direct comparison of prevention efficiency for different targeting strategies can be attained by choosing equivalent‐impact thresholds. To match the impact of benefit‐targeting at a threshold of 2.3%, we can lower the risk‐targeting threshold to ≈5% (Figure 2), which would produce 5.6% impact (4.7–6.6%). At this threshold, the average NNT 10 is nearly equivalent — 24.6 (23.5–25.8; compare with 24.2 as above) — though the maximum NNT 10 becomes much higher — 180 (compare with 43.5; Table 2).

### Is lower and lower better and better? A re-evaluation of the evidence from the cholesterol treatment trialists' collaboration meta-analysis for low-density lipoprotein lowering [^34d8bc00]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2012). Low credibility.

Researchers from the Cholesterol Treatment Trialists' (CTT) Collaboration have argued for maximal lowering of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) by the use of pharmacologic agents, with the strongest evidence coming from the five comparison statin studies in their second meta-analysis. The CTT meta-analysis has many strengths but also a number of limitations, which have not been discussed and which, given the clinical implications, require consideration. Among these are: (1) the impact and validity of including revascularizations within a composite primary end point; (2) the inclusion of the A-Z study, whose design does not allow for valid comparisons of two statin regimens; (3) the fact that baseline LDL-C levels in the comparison studies were not low enough to test whether statin therapy reduces risk significantly in groups with an initial low LDL-C; and, most important, (4) authors of the five studies compared doses at the extremes of statin regimens. However, the clinical choice is not between the lowest and the greatest dose of a statin statin regimens, for example, between 10 and 80 mg atorvastatin, but, more realistically, between intermediate and high dose, that is, between 40 and 80 mg atorvastatin. On the basis of the CTT meta-analysis, we calculate that any potential gain from increasing the dose from 40 to 80 mg atorvastatin would be very small, at best a further 2% further reduction in clinical events. The increase in dose, unfortunately, would likely be associated with increased side effects and decreased compliance. Accordingly, whether net benefit would be demonstrable cannot be assumed. It follows that definitive evidence supporting maximal lowering of LDL-C or maximal dose of statins is still lacking and guidelines, if they are to be evidence-based, should acknowledge this uncertainty.

### Evidence-based use of statins for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease [^513386b5]. The American Journal of Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Three-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, commonly known as statins, are widely available, inexpensive, and represent a potent therapy for treating elevated cholesterol. Current national guidelines put forth by the Adult Treatment Panel III recommend statins as part of a comprehensive primary prevention strategy for patients with elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol at increased risk for developing coronary heart disease within 10 years. Lack of a clear-cut mortality benefit in primary prevention has caused some to question the use of statins for patients without known coronary heart disease. On review of the literature, we conclude that current data support only a modest mortality benefit for statin primary prevention when assessed in the short term (< 5 years). Of note, statin primary prevention results in a significant decrease in cardiovascular morbidity over the short and long term and a trend toward increased reduction in mortality over the long term. When appraised together, these data provide compelling evidence to support the use of statins for primary prevention in patients with risk factors for developing coronary heart disease over the next 10 years.

As previously noted, available RCTs evaluating statins for the prevention of CVD events largely used low and moderate doses. There were no clear differences in estimates of effect when the trials were stratified according to statin dose. The Cholesterol Treatment Trialists meta-analysis showed that greater degree of LDL-C reductions achieved were associated with proportional reductions in major cardiovascular events. 25 However, these analyses were based not on randomized comparisons but on the degree of LDL-C reduction achieved.

Limited information is available about use of high-dose statins in a primary prevention population. As such, the harms of statin use for the prevention of CVD events in adults aged 40 to 75 years can only be bounded as small for low- or moderate-dose statins.

However, the most directly applicable body of evidence for patients without a history of CVD demonstrates benefits with use of low- to moderate-dose statins.

Clinical recommendations quoted from the 2013 ACC/AHA guideline state that high-intensity statin therapy should be initiated or continued as first-line therapy in women and men ≤ 75 years of age who have clinical ASCVD, unless contraindicated (Class I; Level of Evidence: A); in individuals with clinical ASCVD in whom high-intensity statin therapy would otherwise be used, when high-intensity statin therapy is contraindicated or when characteristics predisposing to statin-associated adverse effects are present, moderate-intensity statin should be used as the second option if tolerated (Class I; Level of Evidence: A); and in individuals with clinical ASCVD > 75 years of age, it is reasonable to evaluate the potential for ASCVD risk-reduction benefits and for adverse effects, drug-drug interactions and to consider patient preferences when initiating a moderate- or high-intensity statin, and it is reasonable to continue statin therapy in those who are tolerating it (Class IIa; Level of Evidence: A).

### 2022 ACC expert consensus decision pathway on the role of nonstatin therapies for LDL-cholesterol lowering in the management of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^c0d53b42]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

Adults with clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) on statin therapy for secondary prevention — initiation and intensity guidance: High-intensity statin therapy should be initiated in adults aged ≤ 75 years with clinical ASCVD who are not receiving statin therapy, or increased from low or moderate intensity; when high intensity is contraindicated or adverse-effect risk is present, moderate-intensity statin therapy should be used as the second option, if tolerated, with an objective of a 30% to 49% reduction in LDL-C for moderate intensity and ≥ 50% LDL-C reduction for high intensity. For individuals aged > 75 years, evidence supports continuation of statin therapy in those already taking and tolerating it, data support the use of moderate-intensity statin therapy for secondary prevention in individuals with clinical ASCVD aged > 75 years, and it is reasonable to consider initiation of high-intensity statin therapy for secondary prevention in individuals aged > 75 years with decisions based on expected benefit and competing comorbidities. Patients with clinical ASCVD are defined from RCT inclusion criteria and subgroups include those at very high risk, those not at very high risk, and those with baseline LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL.

### Effectiveness of statins as primary prevention in people with different cardiovascular risk: a population-based cohort study [^8b65f748]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2018). Low credibility.

Study Highlights

New guidelines to manage dyslipidemia recommend individualized prevention measures to reduce the incidence of cardiovascular events and focus on two benefit groups: first, secondary prevention patients, diabetics, and patients with one or more cardiovascular risk factors (dyslipidemia, hypertension, or smoking) or with chronic kidney disease; and second, individuals with 10‐year cardiovascular risk estimates. 1, 2, 3, 4 These guidelines have lowered the estimated 10‐year cardiovascular risk threshold to reduce the incidence of cardiovascular events. In primary prevention, European guidelines recommend treatment in individuals with 5% or higher risk on the SCORE 10‐year fatal cardiovascular risk chart and in those with low (< 5%) risk and low‐density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels between 2.6 and 4 mmol/L. 4 US guidelines recommend treatment for individuals aged 40–75 years with 10‐year risk scores 7.5%; each guide, however, with different levels of evidence. 1, 2 In the United Kingdom, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence suggests statin treatment in primary prevention for people with 10% risk. 3 The definition of high cardiovascular risk varies across guidelines and depends on the risk function used, the endpoints considered, the reference population, and the presence of comorbidities. These recommendations are based on the results from previous meta‐analyses 5, 6 and recent clinical trials, 7 which show that the efficacy of statins is similar in high and intermediate cardiovascular risk populations.

These threshold recommendations are controversial for several reasons. First, the population eligible for lifetime statin therapy would increase substantially. Second, the focus is on relative rather than absolute risk reduction. 8, 9, 10 Finally, the randomization of the clinical trials upon which the guidelines are based did not take baseline cardiovascular risk into account.

As participants in clinical trials may not represent the general population because specific groups (statin‐intolerant or poorly adherent, diabetics, women, young people) are often excluded, 11 data from electronic medical records can be used to provide population‐based evidence for cardiovascular risk management decisions and to evaluate treatment effectiveness in real‐life clinical conditions. 12

The aim of the present study was to analyze the effectiveness of statins in a general population according to their coronary risk estimation.

### Statins for primary cardiovascular disease prevention… [^2d5f9b4b]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

Although elevated low-density lipoprotein is associated with higher rates of CVD, 2 there is uncertainty regarding the net benefit to risk ratio of using statins to reduce LDL among persons without CVD. This contrasts with the established role of LDL reduction for persons with established CVD. First, the Task Force concludes with moderate certainty that those with an estimated 10-year CVD event risk of 10% or higher based on the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association pooled cohort equations and at least 1 risk factor — dyslipidemia, diabetes, hypertension, and/or smoking — are likely to derive moderate benefit from initiation of a moderate-intensity statin. Second, the Task Force concludes with moderate certainty that those with an estimated 10-year CVD event risk of 7.

5% to less than 10% and at least 1 risk factor are likely to experience small net benefit from initiation of a moderate-intensity statin, and thus clinicians should engage patients in shared decision-making. Third, the Task Force concludes that there is insufficient evidence to fully assess the net harms and benefits of initiating statins in adults 76 years and older, regardless of estimated 10-year CVD event risk or presence of risk factors. In contrast with its 2016 recommendations, 3 the USPSTF no longer recommends use of low-intensity statins in certain situations. This change is driven by the fact that 17 of the 22 trials had fixed-dose statin groups, including 12 which used moderate-intensity statins. 6 We are unaware of any RCTs that directly compare either different statin intensities in terms of clinical CVD outcomes or fixed-dose vs titrate-to-LDL goal approaches.

At present, there are further reasons to curb our enthusiasm about the use of statins for primary prevention of CVD. There is a difference between statistically significant and clinically meaningful benefit. The purported benefits of statins in terms of relative risk reduction are fairly constant across baseline lipid levels and cardiovascular risk score categories for primary prevention. 6 Therefore, the absolute benefit for those in lower-risk categories is likely small given that their baseline absolute risk is low, while the chance of adverse effects is constant across risk categories.

### Recent update to the US cholesterol treatment guidelines: a comparison with international guidelines [^01b949c6]. Circulation (2016). Low credibility.

The 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) cholesterol guideline advocated several changes from the previous Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines. Assuming full implementation, the 2013 ACC/AHA guideline would identify ≈13 million Americans as newly eligible for consideration of statin therapy. Three features of the 2013 ACC/AHA guideline primarily responsible for these differences are the specific risk assessment tool endorsed, the risk threshold considered sufficient to warrant primary prevention statin therapy, and the decision not to include cholesterol treatment targets. There is no consensus among international guidelines on the optimal approach to these 3 components. The 2013 ACC/AHA guideline recommends assessing absolute risk with the Pooled Cohort equations, which were developed to improve on previous risk assessment models by including stroke as an outcome and by broadening racial and geographic diversity. Each of the leading international guidelines recommends a different equation for absolute risk assessment. The 2013 ACC/AHA guideline advises consideration of statin therapy for an estimated 10-year risk of atherosclerotic vascular disease of ≥ 7.5%, which is lower than the thresholds recommended by other leading international guidelines. Lastly, the 2013 ACC/AHA guideline does not endorse a treat-to-target strategy but instead specifies the appropriate intensity of statin for each risk category. This approach is shared by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines but differs from other international guidelines. In this review, we summarize the 2013 ACC/AHA cholesterol guideline recommendations and compare them with recommendations from Adult Treatment Panel III and other leading international guidelines.

### Triglyceride levels and residual risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease events and death in adults receiving statin therapy for primary or secondary prevention: insights from the KP REACH study [^fa12963b]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

We found that approximately three‐quarters of studied primary and secondary prevention patients receiving statin therapy had a well‐controlled LDL‐C (ie, 41–100 mg/dL). Secondary prevention patients tended to be older, men, less racially/ethnically diverse, had a higher prevalence of comorbidities, and experienced substantially higher rates of morbidity and mortality than primary prevention patients. In general, triglyceride levels decreased with age and were lower in non‐Hispanic Black patients and higher in Hispanic and Asian/Pacific Islander patients compared with non‐Hispanic White patients. Finally, elevated triglyceride levels were associated with increased risk of MACE and expanded MACE and decreased risk of all‐cause death in both the primary and secondary prevention cohorts.

Only ~30% to 35% of statin‐treated patients in our population had a triglyceride level ≥ 150 mg/dL and would therefore be potentially eligible for currently available additional cardioprotective medications and emerging pharmacotherapies intended for this target population. However, patients remained at high residual risk of ASCVD events despite achieving a well‐controlled LDL‐C on statin therapy and a relatively low prevalence of hypertriglyceridemia, underscoring the importance of a global assessment of ASCVD risk. As expected, despite treatment with statins, patients with established ASCVD have a substantially higher rate of ASCVD events compared with those with only ASCVD risk factors. Thus, in the absence of strong risk‐enhancing features (ie, clinical characteristics, biomarkers, and/or imaging findings), there may be more limited opportunity for further risk reduction in the setting of primary prevention given the low background ischemic event rate seen in a contemporary on‐treatment population.

### Individualized dose-response to statins associated with cardiovascular disease outcomes [^dcd4cbd8]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Study Limitations

Data were collected from a large database that spans an extensive, specialized quaternary academic medical center with a large catchment area for health care in the region. The breadth and depth of the database enable reconstruction of dose-response curves that were central to this study. However, the data are limited by chart fragmentation and the fact that our institution is a specialized referral center. As a result, many individuals may receive their primary care from clinicians outside of our center, and even those individuals who receive their primary care at our center may be different from the general population of statin users, posing a risk of selection bias. We attempted to mitigate these factors through carefully defined inclusion and exclusion criteria to maximize the chance of capturing our intended population of patients.

We were also able to analyze 3 different statin cohorts to gain insight into individual medication and medication class effects, among cohorts with multiple ancestries. Multiple ancestries were included within dose-response and survival analysis, although significantly smaller for non-White ancestries. Furthermore, sample sizes for each statin were different due to the historic length of availability for each statin and their changing prescribing patterns over time. Especially for the rosuvastatin cohort, the sample size was limited. Additionally, we were not able to adjust for variables associated with ASCVD risk that were not available as structured EHR data, including alcohol intake and physical activity, in the survival analysis, potentially affecting findings. Multi-institutional consortia are needed to examine these findings further and to assess their generalizability. Multi-institutional studies would also enable more focused analysis of the secondary prevention use case within the rosuvastatin subset, where rosuvastatin appears to be heavily used.

### Trends in statin prescription prevalence, initiation, and dosing: hong kong, 2004–2015 [^9b806fd5]. Atherosclerosis (2019). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Clinical practice guidelines recommend specific statin doses for the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. Little is known about how statin utilization and dosing have evolved over time in Hong Kong. The aim of this study was to describe trends in statin prevalence, initiation, and dosing from 2004 to 2015.

Methods

Patients receiving public health services, who were prescribed a statin, were included if they received a lipid test at a single center (n = 58,672). Using the territory-wide electronic health record, prescribed daily statin dose, nondaily dose frequency, and statin dose intensity were determined for statin prescriptions from 2004 to 2015. Statin prescription prevalence and initiation rates were estimated using the appropriate at-risk population in the hospital catchment area as the denominator. Prescribed daily doses were stratified by primary or secondary cardiovascular prevention status to assess changes in statin dosing over time.

Results

The prescription prevalence of statins was higher in 2015 (8.68%; 95% CI, 8.60%-8.75%) as compared with 2004 (1.82%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.78%-1.86%). Initiation rates for new statin users increased from 2004 to 2013. High-intensity statins were infrequently prescribed. New users generally had higher statin initiation rates for primary prevention. There were small increases in the prescribed daily doses of statins. Nondaily statin dosing was infrequent (0.42% of all prescriptions).

Conclusions

The prevalence and initiation of statin prescriptions increased in Hong Kong, and was in part driven by low-intensity statins for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease.

### 2015 ACC / AHA focused update of secondary prevention lipid performance measures: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on performance measures [^a6b88315]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2016). Medium credibility.

ACC/AHA guideline recommendations for statin intensity in clinical ASCVD — High-intensity statin therapy should be initiated or continued as first-line therapy in women and men ≤ 75 years of age who have clinical ASCVD, unless contraindicated, and when high-intensity statin therapy is contraindicated or when characteristics predisposing to statin-associated adverse effects are present, moderate-intensity statin should be used as the second option if tolerated. In individuals with clinical ASCVD > 75 years of age, it is reasonable to evaluate the potential for ASCVD risk-reduction benefits and for adverse effects, drug-drug interactions and to consider patient preferences when initiating a moderate- or high-intensity statin, and it is reasonable to continue statin therapy in those who are tolerating it. Clinical ASCVD includes acute coronary syndromes, a history of MI, stable or unstable angina, coronary or other arterial revascularization, stroke, TIA, and peripheral arterial disease presumed to be of atherosclerotic origin.

### Treatment of blood cholesterol to reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk in adults: synopsis of the 2013 American college of cardiology / American Heart Association cholesterol guideline [^6ed7724e]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Description

In November 2013, the American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) released a clinical practice guideline on the treatment of blood cholesterol to reduce cardiovascular risk in adults. This synopsis summarizes the major recommendations.

Methods

In 2008, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute convened the Adult Treatment Panel (ATP) IV to update the 2001 ATP-III cholesterol guidelines using a rigorous process to systematically review randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) and meta-analyses of RCTs that examined cardiovascular outcomes. The panel commissioned independent systematic evidence reviews on low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol goals in secondary and primary prevention and the effect of lipid drugs on atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease events and adverse effects. In September 2013, the panel's draft recommendations were transitioned to the ACC/AHA.

Recommendations

This synopsis summarizes key features of the guidelines in 8 areas: lifestyle, groups shown to benefit from statins, statin safety, decision making, estimation of cardiovascular disease risk, intensity of statin therapy, treatment targets, and monitoring of statin therapy.

### Statins for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease [^7a82a1ff]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Reducing high blood cholesterol, a risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) events in people with and without a past history of coronary heart disease (CHD) is an important goal of pharmacotherapy. Statins are the first-choice agents. Previous reviews of the effects of statins have highlighted their benefits in people with coronary artery disease. The case for primary prevention, however, is less clear.

Objectives

To assess the effects, both harms and benefits, of statins in people with no history of CVD.

Search Strategy

To avoid duplication of effort, we checked reference lists of previous systematic reviews. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Issue 1, 2007), MEDLINE (2001 to March 2007) and EMBASE (2003 to March 2007). There were no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of statins with minimum duration of one year and follow-up of six months, in adults with no restrictions on their total low density lipoprotein (LDL) or high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels, and where 10% or less had a history of CVD, were included.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently selected studies for inclusion and extracted data. Outcomes included all cause mortality, fatal and non-fatal CHD, CVD and stroke events, combined endpoints (fatal and non-fatal CHD, CVD and stroke events), change in blood total cholesterol concentration, revascularisation, adverse events, quality of life and costs. Relative risk (RR) was calculated for dichotomous data, and for continuous data pooled weighted mean differences (with 95% confidence intervals) were calculated.

Main Results

Fourteen randomised control trials (16 trial arms; 34,272 participants) were included. Eleven trials recruited patients with specific conditions (raised lipids, diabetes, hypertension, microalbuminuria). All-cause mortality was reduced by statins (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.95) as was combined fatal and non-fatal CVD endpoints (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.79). Benefits were also seen in the reduction of revascularisation rates (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.83). Total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol were reduced in all trials but there was evidence of heterogeneity of effects. There was no clear evidence of any significant harm caused by statin prescription or of effects on patient quality of life.

Authors' Conclusions

Although reductions in all-cause mortality, composite endpoints and revascularisations were found with no excess of adverse events, there was evidence of selective reporting of outcomes, failure to report adverse events and inclusion of people with cardiovascular disease. Only limited evidence showed that primary prevention with statins may be cost effective and improve patient quality of life. Caution should be taken in prescribing statins for primary prevention among people at low cardiovascular risk.

### Starting primary prevention earlier with statins [^6c6544bc]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

The 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Guideline on the Treatment of Blood Cholesterol to Reduce Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Risk in Adults was based on a systematic review of randomized trials with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) outcomes and meta-analyses of these trials published through 2011. With evidence of an ASCVD risk reduction benefit greatly outweighing the potential for adverse effects, the guideline recommends statin therapy for primary prevention in those with ≥ 7.5% 10-year ASCVD risk and consideration of statin therapy in those with 5% to < 7.5% 10-year ASCVD risk. Subsequent meta-analyses of the statin trials support these recommendations and have additionally found a reduction in total mortality in lower-risk subjects. Additional evidence from imaging trials and epidemiologic studies suggests that initiation of statin therapy earlier in the course of ASCVD could have the potential to more effectively prevent age-related progression of atherosclerosis. Given the high levels of suboptimal risk factors in adults and the safety and availability of low-cost generic statins, a consideration of all the available evidence strongly supports earlier intervention for the primary prevention of ASCVD. In conclusion, earlier initiation of statin therapy has the potential to have a large long-term impact on the heavy burden of cardiovascular disease in the aging populations.

### Intensive low-density lipoprotein cholesterol lowering in cardiovascular disease prevention: opportunities and challenges [^38122881]. Heart (2021). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, preventing ASCVD requires a coordinated response across primary and secondary care to diagnose and manage patients according to their risk profile. As the major modifiable causal factor for atherosclerosis, lowering LDL-C is the primary target and appropriate modification of dietary and lifestyle risk factors is the starting point. The updated 2019 ESC/EAS guidelines recommend a move towards intensive lowering of LDL-C, which is warranted on scientific grounds and achievable in clinical practice. Implementation strategies are needed to apply current knowledge, guidelines and clinical judgement to the benefit of those at highest risk.

Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2025). High credibility.

Statin effects on LDL-C and events in older adults are summarized from observational and trial data: LDL-C response to low to moderate-intensity statins was slightly greater (2–5% depending on statin and dose) among adults without ASCVD older than 75 years compared to those aged ≤ 50, and differences with high-intensity therapy were minimal. Over a median follow-up of 2.5 years, major vascular event reduction per 1 mmol/L LDL-C reduction showed adjusted HR 0.76, 0.73, 0.81, 0.81, and 0.77 across age groups with no differences by age. Among individuals without ASCVD up to age 75 in randomized statin trials, the average time to benefit was 2.5 years. Across 28 major statin trials (n = 186,854), only 8% were over age 75 and only 2% of primary prevention participants were over age 75.

Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Statin dosing sensitivity and lifestyle counseling across racial/ethnic groups — Japanese patients may be sensitive to statin dosing, with an open-label, randomized primary-prevention trial showing a reduction in CVD events with low-intensity doses of pravastatin as compared with placebo, and a secondary-prevention trial in Japanese participants with CAD benefiting from a moderate-intensity dose of pitavastatin. No sensitivity to statin dosage is seen in Hispanic/Latino Americans as compared with non-Hispanic white or black individuals, and no sensitivity to statin dosage is seen in blacks as compared with non-Hispanic white individuals. Using a lower statin intensity in Japanese patients may give results similar to those seen with higher intensities in non-Japanese patients, and clinicians should use lifestyle counseling to recommend a hearthealthy diet consistent with racial/ethnic preferences to avoid weight gain and address BP and lipids.

### 2019 ACC / AHA guideline on the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines [^fc4305f4]. Circulation (2019). High credibility.

ACC/AHA 2019 primary prevention — statins in diabetes states that most patients 40 to 75 years of age with diabetes are at intermediate or high risk (PCE ≥ 7.5% 10-year risk) of ASCVD events, and three of 4 double-blinded primary-prevention RCTs of moderate statin therapy in this age range showed significant reductions in ASCVD events. A meta-analysis found moderate-intensity statin therapy was associated with a risk reduction of 25%, similar to people without diabetes and with no apparent difference between type 1 diabetes mellitus and T2DM; therefore, moderate-intensity statin therapy is indicated for primary prevention in patients 40 to 75 years of age with diabetes. Residual risk remained high in trials (e.g., 8.5% had major cardiovascular events in 3.8 years), no RCTs of high-intensity statin therapy have been carried out exclusively in diabetes, and high-intensity statin therapy is preferred in patients with diabetes as they develop risk modifiers.

### Management of dyslipidemia for cardiovascular disease risk reduction: synopsis of the 2020 updated U.S. department of veterans affairs and U.S. department of defense clinical practice guideline [^2a4cc9b9]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Knowledge gaps — primary prevention medical therapy comparisons: The pool of primary prevention studies using statins almost exclusively employed moderate-dose statins, and the JUPITER trial was the only study that employed a high-dose statin; prospective comparisons of different statin intensities might demonstrate an additional benefit of higher statin doses in patients treated for primary prevention. Studies of ezetimibe monotherapy and ezetimibe and statin combination therapy showing patient-oriented outcomes in primary prevention are lacking, and while similar arguments can be made for bempedoic acid, icosapent ethyl, and PCSK9 inhibitors, their high cost and the large NNT for all therapies in primary prevention limit the potential cost-effectiveness of these medication classes at current prices.

### Triglyceride levels and residual risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease events and death in adults receiving statin therapy for primary or secondary prevention: insights from the KP REACH study [^6678e681]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Background Patients with risk factors or established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease remain at high-risk for ischemic events. Triglyceride levels may play a causal role. Methods and Results We performed a retrospective study of adults aged ≥ 45 years receiving statin therapy, with a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol of 41 to 100 mg/dL, and ≥ 1 risk factor or established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease between 2010 and 2017. Outcomes included death, all-cause hospitalization, and major adverse cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction, stroke, or peripheral artery disease). The study sample included 373 389 primary prevention patients and 97 832 secondary prevention patients. The primary prevention cohort had a mean age of 65 ± 10 years, with 51% women and 44% people of color, whereas the secondary prevention cohort had a mean age of 71 ± 11 years, with 37% women and 32% people of color. Median triglyceride levels for the primary and secondary prevention cohorts were 122 mg/dL (interquartile range, 88–172 mg/dL) and 116 mg/dL (interquartile range, 84–164 mg/dL), respectively. In multivariable analyses, primary prevention patients with triglyceride levels ≥ 150 mg/dL were at lower adjusted risk of death (hazard ratio [HR], 0.91; 95% CI, 0.89–0.94) and higher risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (HR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.05–1.24). In the secondary prevention cohort, patients with triglyceride levels ≥ 150 mg/dL were at lower adjusted risk of death (HR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.92–0.97) and higher risk of all-cause hospitalization (HR, 1.03; 95% CI, 1.01–1.05) and major adverse cardiovascular events (HR, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.05–1.24). Conclusions In a contemporary cohort receiving statin therapy, elevated triglyceride levels were associated with a greater risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease events and lower risk of death.

### Population impact&efficiency of benefit-targeted versus risk-targeted statin prescribing for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease [^eb13a89d]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

The impact‐efficiency trade‐off for these strategies can be illustrated by plotting impact versus NNT 10 (Figure 2). For any given level of impact, the maximum NNT 10 is substantially lower for benefit‐targeted prescribing than risk‐targeted prescribing (in Figure 2 A, the green curve is shifted toward the upper left corner compared with the red curve). The average NNT 10, however, is nearly identical (Figure 2 B). For comparison, we have plotted age‐targeted prescribing of moderate‐intensity statins, which is substantially less efficient by any metric; and benefit‐targeted high‐intensity statins, which is substantially more efficient and also potentially more impactful. For example, we project that high‐intensity statins prescribed for all persons with an expected ARR ≥ 2.3 would produce a 7.1% (6.0–8.4) impact at an average NNT 10 of 21.6 (20.7–22.6) and a maximum NNT 10 of 43.3. Although improved risk prediction will improve efficiency of targeted therapy, it will not improve potential maximum impact for any given strategy; for example, moderate‐intensity statins with even theoretical perfect prediction does not match the potential impact of high‐intensity statins prescribed for persons with expected ARR ≥ 1.5 (expected impact = 8.4% [7.1–9.8] and average NNT 10 = 26.3 [24.9–27.8]; Figure 2).

### Statin use for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^a7912a49]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of morbidity and death in the US and is the cause of more than 1 of every 4 deaths. Coronary heart disease is the single leading cause of death and accounts for 43% of deaths attributable to CVD in the US. In 2019, an estimated 558 000 deaths were caused by coronary heart disease and 109 000 deaths were caused by ischemic stroke.

Objective

To update its 2016 recommendation, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) commissioned a review of the evidence on the benefits and harms of statins for reducing CVD-related morbidity or mortality or all-cause mortality.

Population

Adults 40 years or older without a history of known CVD and who do not have signs and symptoms of CVD.

Evidence Assessment

The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that statin use for the prevention of CVD events and all-cause mortality in adults aged 40 to 75 years with no history of CVD and who have 1 or more CVD risk factors (ie, dyslipidemia, diabetes, hypertension, or smoking) and an estimated 10-year CVD event risk of 10% or greater has at least a moderate net benefit. The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that statin use for the prevention of CVD events and all-cause mortality in adults aged 40 to 75 years with no history of CVD and who have 1 or more of these CVD risk factors and an estimated 10-year CVD event risk of 7.5% to less than 10% has at least a small net benefit. The USPSTF concludes that the evidence is insufficient to determine the balance of benefits and harms of statin use for the primary prevention of CVD events and mortality in adults 76 years or older with no history of CVD.

Recommendation

The USPSTF recommends that clinicians prescribe a statin for the primary prevention of CVD for adults aged 40 to 75 years who have 1 or more CVD risk factors (ie, dyslipidemia, diabetes, hypertension, or smoking) and an estimated 10-year CVD risk of 10% or greater. (B recommendation) The USPSTF recommends that clinicians selectively offer a statin for the primary prevention of CVD for adults aged 40 to 75 years who have 1 or more of these CVD risk factors and an estimated 10-year CVD risk of 7.5% to less than 10%. The likelihood of benefit is smaller in this group than in persons with a 10-year risk of 10% or greater. (C recommendation) The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of initiating a statin for the primary prevention of CVD events and mortality in adults 76 years or older. (I statement).

### 2019 ACC / AHA guideline on the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: executive summary: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines [^23a6256f]. Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Adults with high blood cholesterol — risk enhancers and coronary artery calcium (CAC) to guide statin therapy are outlined as follows: In intermediate-risk (≥ 7.5% to < 20% 10-year ASCVD risk) adults, risk-enhancing factors favor initiation or intensification of statin therapy. In patients at borderline risk (5% to < 7.5% 10-year ASCVD risk), in risk discussion, the presence of risk-enhancing factors may justify initiation of moderate-intensity statin therapy. When CAC is measured to inform treatment, if the coronary artery calcium score is zero, it is reasonable to withhold statin therapy and reassess in 5 to 10 years when higher-risk conditions are absent; if the coronary artery calcium score is 1 to 99, it is reasonable to initiate statin therapy for patients ≥ 55 years of age; and if the coronary artery calcium score is 100 or higher or in the 75th percentile or higher, it is reasonable to initiate statin therapy.

### Achieving greater reductions in cardiovascular risk: lessons from statin therapy on risk measures and risk reduction [^ca5eec91]. American Heart Journal (2004). Low credibility.

Reductions in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol with statins have been shown to significantly reduce risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) in the primary- and secondary-prevention settings. Benefit has been observed even in high-risk patients whose baseline LDL cholesterol levels were below the drug initiation levels recommended by current treatment guidelines. Levels of non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol or total apolipoprotein B more accurately reflect circulating levels of atherogenic particles than does LDL cholesterol concentration, and may provide a surrogate marker that correlates better to CHD event reduction after statin therapy than LDL cholesterol level. More effective lipid-lowering therapy than that currently practiced may be needed in many patients to achieve optimal CHD risk reduction.

Statin intensity and LDL-C response considerations — For Asian Americans, "Japanese patients may be sensitive to statin dosing". Evidence notes that "In an open-label, randomized primary-prevention trial, Japanese participants had a reduction in CVD events with low-intensity doses of pravastatin as compared with placebo" and "In a secondary-prevention trial, Japanese participants with CAD benefited from a moderate-intensity dose of pitavastatin". For Hispanic/Latino and Black/African American groups, "No sensitivity to statin dosage is seen, as compared with non-Hispanic white or black individuals" or "as compared with non-Hispanic white individuals". A comment adds, "Using a lower statin intensity in Japanese patients may give results similar to those seen with higher intensities in non-Japanese patients".
