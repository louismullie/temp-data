## Question

What to do if protein in the urine

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what to do if protein is found in the urine. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the finding and excluding transient causes. Then, I should quantify proteinuria and classify severity. Next, I will evaluate the underlying etiology and stage CKD if present. After that, I need to initiate risk-stratified management, including RAAS blockade, blood pressure targets, and disease-specific therapies. Finally, I should set a monitoring plan and define referral thresholds, while considering special populations and correcting any missteps along the way if I overgeneralize or miss a nuance.

> Let me first confirm the finding and not jump to conclusions, because transient proteinuria is common and can be due to fever, exercise, dehydration, or acute illness; I should repeat testing with a first-morning urine ACR or PCR to verify persistence and exclude orthostatic proteinuria, and I need to ensure I interpret results in the context of urinary concentration and analytical variability, since a single abnormal value is insufficient to diagnose CKD or dictate therapy [^395a5328] [^ed1546a4] [^acddd1ae].

> Wait, let me verify the best way to quantify proteinuria; I initially thought a 24-hour collection is always preferred, but hold on, that's too broad. For most CKD screening and longitudinal monitoring, a first-morning ACR is recommended, whereas in glomerular disease or when immunosuppression is contemplated, a 24-hour urine protein excretion is preferred to average circadian and activity-related variation; if a full 24-hour collection is impractical, measuring PCR in an aliquot of an intended 12–24 hour collection is a reasonable compromise, and I should double-check that I'm not substituting a random spot PCR for a timed collection in high-magnitude proteinuria [^38e256ee] [^17a1e408] [^bd72b837].

> I need to classify severity next, because management hinges on this. Normal ACR is less than 30 mg/g, moderately increased is 30–300 mg/g, and severely increased is greater than 300 mg/g; nephrotic-range proteinuria is typically defined as greater than 3.5 g/day in adults, and in children nephrotic-range is often defined by a first-morning UPCR of at least 2 g/g, so I should confirm the threshold I'm using matches the clinical context and guideline [^f19793e2] [^1e331c09].

> Next, I should review the etiologic workup, and I need to ensure I don't anchor on a single cause. I will assess for diabetes, hypertension, autoimmune disease, and medications such as NSAIDs or VEGF pathway inhibitors, and I will examine the urine sediment for cells and casts, obtain eGFR, and consider kidney imaging if indicated; if I find nephrotic-range proteinuria, hematuria, systemic features, or rapidly changing kidney function, I should expedite nephrology referral and consider biopsy, and I should remember that in children, PCR is preferred initially because tubular proteinuria is more common and ACR alone may miss it [^6247d02d] [^90832c7d] [^b4943310].

> Hold on, I should verify CKD staging and chronicity before labeling someone. CKD is defined by eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m² or markers of kidney damage such as albuminuria persisting for at least 3 months, so I must document persistence and not assume chronicity from a single abnormal ACR or eGFR; once confirmed, I should stage by GFR and albuminuria categories to guide risk stratification and monitoring frequency [^3bc1f59d] [^acddd1ae].

> Now, I will initiate management, and I need to ensure I prioritize interventions with the strongest evidence. For patients with ACR 30 mg/g or higher, I should start an ACE inhibitor or ARB unless contraindicated, titrating to the maximally tolerated dose to reduce proteinuria and slow CKD progression; I should avoid dual ACEi/ARB therapy because it increases adverse events without improving hard outcomes, and I should consider adding an SGLT2 inhibitor in appropriate adults with CKD and albuminuria, as this further reduces kidney failure and cardiovascular events beyond RAAS blockade [^773c803f] [^3aef7df2] [^b0228853].

> I should confirm blood pressure targets and tailor them. In proteinuric CKD, a reasonable target is less than 130/80 mmHg if tolerated, with some guidelines supporting less than 120/80 mmHg in selected high-risk patients, but I need to monitor eGFR and potassium closely after initiating or intensifying RAAS blockade and adjust therapy if there is a greater than 30% decline in eGFR or hyperkalemia develops [^e80559cf] [^115cca34].

> Let me consider lifestyle and supportive measures, and I should double-check that I'm not overprescribing protein restriction. Sodium restriction to less than 2 g/day enhances the antiproteinuric effect of RAAS blockade, weight optimization and smoking cessation are important, and in diabetes I should individualize glycemic targets; protein intake around 0.8 g/kg/day is reasonable in non-dialysis CKD with proteinuria, but I should avoid overly strict restriction and tailor to nutritional status and CKD stage [^b0228853] [^989cd829].

> But wait, what if the proteinuria reflects a specific glomerular disease where disease-specific therapy changes outcomes. In IgA nephropathy with proteinuria above 0.5 g/day, RAAS blockade is indicated even without hypertension, and a reasonable surrogate target is to reduce proteinuria to less than 1 g/day; in lupus nephritis, I should aim for at least a 25% reduction by 3 months and less than 500–700 mg/g by 12 months, and in primary membranous nephropathy I should optimize supportive care and consider immunosuppression if proteinuria remains nephrotic and persistent; in sickle cell disease, I should initiate ACEi for microalbuminuria or proteinuria even with normal blood pressure [^773c803f] [^27fb8f55] [^2bc71a6d] [^0f1d6ad4].

> I will now examine monitoring, and I need to ensure frequency matches risk. In people with CKD, I should check albuminuria and eGFR at least annually, and more often in those at higher risk or when therapeutic changes are made; a doubling of ACR or a greater than 20% decline in eGFR exceeds expected variability and warrants evaluation, and I should confirm unexpected changes with repeat testing before acting [^115cca34] [^6d001dd6] [^41722514].

> Next, I should review referral thresholds, and I need to balance early specialty input with resource realities. Referral to nephrology is appropriate for eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m², rapidly declining kidney function, nephrotic-range proteinuria, hematuria with proteinuria, suspected glomerular disease, refractory hypertension, or complex multisystem disease; risk-based referral using a 5-year kidney failure risk of 3–5% is also reasonable in some systems, and I should remember that VA/DoD guidance does not endorse a single universal threshold, so clinical judgment remains essential [^6247d02d] [^574078ad] [^8b476af1].

> Hold on, I should verify special populations and correct any overgeneralizations. In pregnancy, new proteinuria after 20 weeks raises concern for preeclampsia and warrants close maternal-fetal monitoring, whereas proteinuria before 20 weeks suggests underlying kidney disease and should prompt nephrology referral; in children, PCR is preferred for initial screening and nephrotic syndrome is defined by first-morning UPCR at least 2 g/g alongside hypoalbuminemia; in older adults, I should individualize BP targets and medication choices given frailty and fall risk; in resource-limited settings, I should prioritize low-cost, high-yield interventions like RAAS blockade and BP control while adapting measurement strategies to local capacity [^e79a3527] [^1e331c09] [^3674bb52].

> Let me reconsider the key principle to ensure internal consistency. Proteinuria is both a marker of kidney damage and a driver of progression, so my goals are to confirm persistence, quantify severity, identify and treat the cause, reduce proteinuria with RAAS blockade and adjuncts as indicated, control blood pressure and other risk factors, and monitor for change with predefined thresholds that trigger action; if I deviate from this framework, I should double-check that I have a guideline-supported rationale and that I have mitigated foreseeable harms [^c982bc57] [^5141877c] [^115cca34].

If protein is found in urine, **confirm with a first-morning ACR or PCR** [^395a5328] and repeat if positive to ensure persistence [^ed1546a4]. Persistent proteinuria warrants **evaluating for causes** such as diabetes, hypertension, or glomerular disease [^6247d02d], and **starting ACEi/ARB therapy** if proteinuria is ≥ 30 mg/g or if the patient has CKD, to reduce proteinuria and slow progression [^773c803f] [^67913aec]. Monitor ACR/PCR and eGFR at least annually, and refer to nephrology if proteinuria is > 1 g/day, there is rapid eGFR decline, or the cause is unclear [^115cca34] [^6247d02d]. Address modifiable risks (blood pressure, glycemia, lifestyle) and avoid nephrotoxins [^5141877c].

---

## Confirm and quantify proteinuria

- **Initial detection**: Proteinuria may be detected by dipstick, but this is semiquantitative and prone to false positives/negatives [^661cacf2].

- **Confirmatory testing**: Use a first-morning urine ACR or PCR to confirm and quantify proteinuria [^395a5328] [^38e256ee].

- **Repeat testing**: Repeat if positive to confirm persistence, as transient proteinuria is common [^ed1546a4].

- **24-hour collection**: Consider when accurate quantification is needed (e.g. nephrotic-range proteinuria or before immunosuppression) [^bd72b837].

---

## Evaluate underlying causes

Persistent proteinuria requires a **structured evaluation**:

| **Category** | **Common causes** |
|-|-|
| Glomerular | - Diabetes <br/> - Hypertension <br/> - IgA nephropathy <br/> - Lupus nephritis <br/> - Membranous nephropathy [^notfound] |
| Tubular | - Interstitial nephritis <br/> - Reflux nephropathy <br/> - Fanconi syndrome |
| Overflow | - Multiple myeloma (Bence Jones protein) <br/> - Hemolysis <br/> - Rhabdomyolysis [^bf5f56ad] |
| Functional | - Fever <br/> - Exercise <br/> - Dehydration <br/> - Orthostatic proteinuria [^79980d5f] |

---

Assess for **risk factors** (diabetes, hypertension, autoimmune disease, family history) and perform targeted labs (serum creatinine/eGFR, glucose, electrolytes, autoimmune panel, SPEP/UPEP if indicated) [^6247d02d].

---

## Management strategies

### General measures

- **Blood pressure control**: Target < 130/80 mmHg if tolerated; lower targets may benefit those with proteinuria [^e80559cf].

- **Glycemic control**: Aim for HbA1c ~7.0% in diabetes with CKD, individualized [^4d0cd0c1].

- **Lifestyle**: Sodium restriction, weight loss, smoking cessation, and exercise [^b0228853].

---

### Pharmacologic therapy

- **ACE inhibitors/ARBs**: First-line for proteinuria ≥ 30 mg/g or CKD; titrate to maximally tolerated dose [^773c803f] [^67913aec].

- **SGLT2 inhibitors**: Add in diabetic or non-diabetic CKD with proteinuria to reduce progression and cardiovascular events [^b0228853].

- **Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists**: Consider for residual proteinuria despite ACEi/ARB (monitor potassium) [^b0228853].

- **Immunosuppression**: For glomerular diseases (e.g. lupus nephritis, vasculitis) after specialist input [^27fb8f55].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Monitor **ACR/PCR and eGFR** at least annually in CKD, and more frequently if proteinuria is high or CKD advances [^115cca34] [^af0dc45d]. A **doubling of ACR** or a **> 20% decline in eGFR** warrants evaluation and potential therapy adjustment [^115cca34] [^41722514].

---

## Indications for nephrology referral

Refer to nephrology for:

- **Proteinuria > 1 g/day** or nephrotic syndrome [^6247d02d].

- **Rapid eGFR decline** (> 5 mL/min/year) [^notfound].

- **Unclear diagnosis** or suspected glomerular disease [^6247d02d].

- **Resistant hypertension** or complex cases [^notfound].

---

## Special considerations

- **Pregnancy**: Proteinuria after 20 weeks suggests preeclampsia; monitor closely and manage per obstetric protocols [^e79a3527].

- **Children**: Use first-morning PCR; orthostatic proteinuria is common and benign [^90832c7d].

- **Elderly**: Individualize BP targets and monitor for adverse effects [^e80559cf].

---

Protein in urine requires **confirmatory testing**, evaluation of causes, and risk-stratified management with ACEi/ARB, blood pressure control, and lifestyle measures, plus nephrology referral for significant proteinuria or unclear etiology.

### Proteinuria as a therapeutic target in patients with chronic kidney disease [^e60a7017]. American Journal of Nephrology (2007). Low credibility.

Patients excreting large amounts of urinary protein, who are otherwise deemed to be optimally treated, should still be considered at high risk for renal disease progression. The observation that reductions in urinary protein excretion, in a graded fashion over a relatively short period of time, correlate with long-term preservation of renal function supports the idea of using urinary protein excretion as a guide to implementation of renoprotective therapies. The association between residual proteinuria and renal outcomes suggests that minimization of proteinuria is an important therapeutic goal in the management of proteinuric chronic kidney disease patients. This article reviews the evidence for using proteinuria as a target for the implementation of therapies shown to have renal protective effects.

### Management of glomerular proteinuria: a commentary [^67aac4cd]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2003). Low credibility.

It is widely accepted that proteinuria reduction is an appropriate therapeutic goal in chronic proteinuric kidney disease. Based on large randomized controlled clinical trials (RCT), ACE inhibitor (ACEI) and angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) therapy have emerged as the most important antiproteinuric and renal protective interventions. However, there are numerous other interventions that have been shown to be antiproteinuric and, therefore, likely to be renoprotective. Unfortunately testing each of these antiproteinuric therapies in RCT is not feasible. The nephrologist has two choices: restrict antiproteinuric therapies to those shown to be effective in RCT or expand the use of antiproteinuric therapies to include those that, although unproven, are plausibly effective and prudent to use. The goal of this work is to provide the documentation needed for the nephrologist to choose between these strategies. This work describes 25 separate interventions that are either antiproteinuric or may block injurious mechanisms of proteinuria. Each intervention is assigned a level of recommendation (Level 1 is the highest; Level 3 is the lowest) according to the strength of the evidence supporting its antiproteinuric and renoprotective efficacy. Pathophysiologic mechanisms possibly involved are also discussed. The number of interventions at each level of recommendation are: Level 1, n = 7; Level 2, n = 9; Level 3, n = 9. Our experience indicates that we can achieve in most patients the majority of Level 1 and many of the Level 2 and 3 recommendations. We suggest that, until better information becomes available, a broad-based, multiple-risk factor intervention to reduce proteinuria can be justified in those with progressive nephropathies. This work is intended primarily for clinical nephrologists; therefore, each antiproteinuria intervention is described in practical detail.

### Proteinuria in adults: a diagnostic approach… [^79980d5f]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

Definition of Proteinuria Twenty-four hundred years ago, Hippocrates noted the association between "bubbles on the surface of the urine" and kidney disease. 3, 4 Today, proteinuria is defined as urinary protein excretion of greater than 150 mg per day. Urinary protein excretion in healthy persons varies considerably and may reach proteinuric levels under several circumstances. Most dipstick tests that are positive for protein are a result of benign proteinuria, which has no associated morbidity or mortality. Mechanisms of Proteinuria Normal barriers to protein filtration begin in the glomerulus, which consists of unique capillaries that are permeable to fluid and small solutes but effective barriers to plasma proteins. The adjacent basement membrane and visceral epithelial cells are covered with negatively charged heparan sulfate proteoglycans.

The pathophysiologic mechanisms of proteinuria can be classified as glomerular, tubular or overflow. Glomerular disease is the most common cause of pathologic proteinuria. 8Several glomerular abnormalities alter the permeability of the glomerular basement membrane, resulting in urinary loss of albumin and immunoglobulins. 7Glomerular malfunction can cause large protein losses; urinary excretion of more than 2 g per 24 hours is usually a result of glomerular disease.
9. 12 The sulfosalicylic acid turbidity test qualitatively screens for proteinuria. The advantage of this easily performed test is its greater sensitivity for proteins such as Bence Jones. The SSA method requires a few milliliters of freshly voided, centrifuged urine. An equal amount of 3 percent SSA is added to that specimen. 18 Fortunately, the ratio is about the same numerically as the number of grams of protein excreted in urine per day. Thus, a ratio of less than 0. 2 is equivalent to
0.

2 g of protein per day and is considered normal, a ratio of 3. 5 is equivalent to
3. 5 g of protein per day and is considered nephrotic-range proteinuria. 7 Isolated proteinuria with urinary protein excretion of more than 2 g per day is rare and usually signifies glomerular disease. 7 These patients need further testing, and a nephrology consultation should be considered.

### Proteinuria lowering needs a multifactorial and individualized approach to halt progression of renal disease [^cb155b75]. Nature Clinical Practice: Nephrology (2008). Medium credibility.

This Practice Point commentary discusses the implementation of an intensive, multifactorial intervention in patients who had proteinuria > 3 g/day despite treatment with angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors. In their 'Remission Clinic' in Bergamo, Italy, Ruggenenti et al. implemented an individual titration regimen using ramipril 5–10 mg/day, losartan 50–100 mg/day, verapamil 80–120 mg/day and atorvastatin 10–20 mg/day in successive steps, aiming for a low blood pressure target of < 120/80 mmHg and a proteinuria target of < 0.3 g/day. They found that patients treated in the Remission Clinic had a much slower decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate than a matched historical reference group treated with 1.25–5.00 mg ramipril (diastolic blood pressure goal < 90 mmHg). Only 3.6% of Remission Clinic patients reached end-stage renal disease, compared with 30.4% of the historical controls. No information was provided on the individual responses to the different titration steps; therefore, the contributions of the specific components of the regimen towards the therapeutic benefit cannot be established. The data do, however, encourage an individualized and more active approach to preventing end-stage renal disease in individuals with proteinuric chronic kidney disease.

### Developments in albuminuria testing: a key biomarker for detection, prognosis and surveillance of kidney and cardiovascular disease – A practical update for clinicians [^d89b833a]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

6 CONCLUSION

Since its discovery, albuminuria measurement has undergone remarkable advancements, evolving from a rudimentary diagnostic tool to a pivotal biomarker in nephrology and cardiovascular medicine. Today, albuminuria can be measured with reasonable accuracy, and upcoming standardisation in measurement techniques and pre‐analytical protocols will further improve its reliability and clinical applicability. Despite these advancements, albuminuria screening remains under‐utilised in clinical practice. While population‐based screening may not yet be justified, routine albuminuria assessment should at least be incorporated into laboratory panels to provide a comprehensive cardiovascular risk profile — a practice that is rarely implemented today. Even among high‐risk individuals, such as those with diabetes or hypertension, albuminuria is insufficiently measured, limiting its potential to guide treatment and improve patient outcomes. Greater integration of albuminuria testing into routine clinical practice is therefore pivotal. Beyond its established role in CKD management, albuminuria has also become a key parameter for risk stratification and therapy selection. Recommendations for use in clinical practice are summarised in Table 4. The data presented in this review clearly demonstrate that albuminuria has emerged as a key biomarker for the detection, prognostication, surveillance and treatment optimisation of both kidney and cardiovascular disease.

Regarding medical management for lupus nephritis, more specifically with respect to goals of treatment, ERA-EDTA/EULAR 2020 guidelines recommend to do not switch therapy in patients with nephrotic-range proteinuria at baseline if proteinuria is improving, as they may require an additional 6–12 months to reach complete clinical response.

### Onco-hypertension in patients with kidney disease [^20574e2c]. American Journal of Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Cancer, hypertension, and kidney disease are closely interrelated. Knowledge of the potential hypertensive and nephrotoxic effects of antineoplastic medications is critical to minimizing interruptions in cancer treatment.

Summary

Antineoplastic medications can cause hypertension, proteinuria, and kidney injury, often mediated by common mechanisms. Notably, inhibitors of the vascular endothelial growth factor pathway have the strongest association with both hypertension and proteinuria, typically acute in onset and often reversible after drug discontinuation. The abrupt rise in blood pressure can cause clinically significant hypertensive syndromes and contribute to overall morbidity. Significant proteinuria can herald kidney failure. Close monitoring of blood pressure and renal function during antineoplastic therapy and appropriate hypertension treatment are important. This article reviews available literature and proposes a step-by-step approach to manage cancer patients with concurrent hypertension and kidney disease.

Key Messages

For antineoplastic medications with known hypertensive effect, blood pressure should be checked at baseline and serially during cancer treatment. Hypertensive crisis with end-organ damage, significant proteinuria, microscopic hematuria, or unexplained acute kidney injury necessitates drug cessation until further evaluation and resolution. In patients with chronic kidney disease and cancer therapy-related hypertension, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker is the preferred antihypertensive choice. Finally, multidisciplinary collaboration in these patients will yield the best results.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2021 KDIGO clinical practice guideline for the management of glomerular diseases [^75120481]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2023). High credibility.

Proteinuria — spot urine protein–creatinine ratio (UPCR) guidance and correction: The guideline discourages random (spot) UPCR assessments in patients with glomerular disease, yet in clinical practice a trend in spot UPCR in an individual patient over time provides meaningful input; if using the spot UPCR, efforts should be made to collect samples at the same time of day with similar activity, often with the first morning sample providing the most consistency. A correction is noted for Figure 4 on page 91: instead of " < 300 mg/g (< 30 mg/mmol)" for UPCR, the values should be " < 3,000 mg/g (< 300 mg/mmol) or < 3,500 mg/g" in order to correspond to the traditional thresholds for nephrotic-range proteinuria.

### KDIGO 2022 clinical practice guideline for diabetes management in chronic kidney disease [^17a1e408]. Kidney International (2022). High credibility.

Assessment of kidney function — proteinuria measurement: Key measures for diagnosis, evaluation of prognosis, and management decisions in glomerular disease include measurement (or estimation) of proteinuria and glomerular filtration rate, and assessment of urine total protein excretion rate (PER) using timed urine collections is the preferred method for patients with glomerular disease, particularly when marked proteinuria is present on qualitative testing, because it averages variation due to circadian rhythm, physical activity, and posture and avoids errors of a random spot protein–creatinine ratio (PCR). However, 24-hour urine collection can also be subject to error due to overcollection or undercollection, and simultaneous measurement of urine creatinine and protein in an aliquot of an intended 12–24-hour urine collection is a good compromise.

### Proteinuria and clinical outcomes in hypertensive patients [^ae3fc756]. American Journal of Hypertension (2009). Low credibility.

This narrative review focuses on outcomes related to proteinuria in hypertension (HT), and also examines the role of current and future therapeutic strategies. Proteinuria is an independent marker of renal and cardiovascular (CV) disease in hypertensive populations, particularly in high-risk groups such as diabetic patients. Effective blood pressure (BP) control and proteinuria management are associated with significant improvements in the risk of key adverse outcomes, although a causative relationship needs careful assessment. Available antihypertensives have varying effects on proteinuria reduction. Drugs affecting the renin system offer antiproteinuric and renoprotective effects that are probably at least partially independent of their BP effects. Economic evaluations of these interventions confirm their cost-saving benefits relative to other antihypertensives, but outcomes-based research is needed in some settings.

### Measuring albuminuria or proteinuria: does one answer fit all? [^65a417ee]. Kidney International (2023). Medium credibility.

Measurement of proteinuria is critical for diagnosing and monitoring kidney disease. A variety of measures are available to clinicians and can identify all urinary proteins (proteinuria) or urine albumin alone (albuminuria). Proteinuria and albuminuria can be measured in either a random urine sample or a timed urine collection (often over 24 hours). Although an international guideline advocates the use of the urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio for most purposes, this measure is not universally available worldwide and historically has been more costly than alternatives. In addition, there may be important differences in accuracy between the albumin-to-creatinine ratio and others based on magnitude of albuminuria, sex, and certain clinical contexts. In this mini review, we review recommendations from international guidelines and discuss specific contexts where the optimal measure of proteinuria is unclear and, in some situations, controversial. We discuss the evidence supporting current recommendations for choice of measure, including the clinical settings of glomerulonephritis, transplantation, and pregnancy. We also discuss how patient sex and cost may impact this decision.

### Systematic approach for the management of chronic kidney disease: moving beyond chronic kidney disease classification [^0b0a812f]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review has two aims: to summarize the evolution of classification criteria for chronic kidney disease (CKD) for diagnosis, prognosis and forecasting population burden of illness; to move the discussion beyond classification to intervention by introducing an approach we describe as the 'Systematic Approach for the Management of CKD' (SAM-CKD).

Recent Findings

There is now ample evidence against the use of estimated GFR (eGFR) as the sole criterion for classifying CKD for the purpose of diagnosis, risk stratification and prediction of progression. There is ample evidence that significant proteinuria is a powerful predictor of progression but even more so when combined with reduced eGFR for individual and population risk projection. Hypertension also is an important indicator in CKD progression but not in all studies. Beyond classification, there are no studies addressing standardization of management of CKD to achieve the outcomes articulated by any of the practice guidelines.

Summary

In this article we have moved the discussions of CKD beyond classification by introducing a clinical management tool, SAM-CKD, which couples a broader classification model with a systematic tool for management to foster standardization of CKD management for the future.

### KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease [^50bcc930]. Kidney International (2024). High credibility.

Risk assessment in people with chronic kidney disease (CKD) — Monitoring should include to assess albuminuria in adults, or albuminuria/proteinuria in children, and GFR at least annually in people with CKD, and to assess albuminuria and GFR more often for individuals at higher risk when measurement will impact therapeutic decisions. Thresholds that exceed expected variability and warrant evaluation are a change in eGFR of > 20% on a subsequent test, GFR reductions of > 30% on subsequent testing among those initiating hemodynamically active therapies, and for albuminuria monitoring a doubling of the ACR on a subsequent test.

KDIGO 2024 CKD — urine sampling for albuminuria and proteinuria: Untimed urine samples are a reasonable first test for ascertainment of albuminuria, and a first morning void sample is preferred because it correlates well with 24-hour albumin and/or protein excretion; a random urine sample is acceptable if no first morning void sample is available. Overnight, first void in the morning, second void in the morning, or random sample collections are therefore recommended as first-line tests, recognizing that although the reference point remains the accurately timed 24-hour specimen, it is widely accepted that this is a difficult procedure to control effectively.

Diagnosis of nephrotic syndrome in children — urine protein-to-creatinine ratio (UPCR) and albumin thresholds: The substitution of spot UPCR for the 24-hour urine collection has been established as the standard of care for children, with nephrotic-range proteinuria defined as first morning UPCR of ≥ 2 g/g. Whereas the 2012 KDIGO guideline maintained albumin ≤ 2.5 g/dL, the current guideline suggests serum albumin ≤ 3 g/dl; however, we suggest continuing to use the definition of nephrotic syndrome for children in the absence of evidence to support a change to a higher cutoff. It is unknown whether children with nephrotic-range proteinuria and less severe hypoalbuminemia (albumin of 2.6–2.9 g/dL) have similar pathology or treatment responses, and this has not been studied in prospective clinical trials. Practice Point 4.1.1 states that the definitions relating to nephrotic syndrome in children are based on the clinical characteristics outlined in Figure 39.

### 2024 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) guideline for the screening, treatment, and management of lupus nephritis [^b3707fcb]. Arthritis Care & Research (2025). High credibility.

Monitoring lupus nephritis activity — The gold standard for assessing proteinuria, the 24-hour urine collection, is challenging to implement in clinical practice; random urine protein-to-creatinine ratios are usually adequate. The first void of the day sample is the most accurate for the spot urine collection but may not be feasible, and unexpected results on random testing should be followed by a 24-hour collection, especially before any change in therapy. In people with LN who have not achieved CRR, we strongly recommend quantifying proteinuria at least every 3 months; in people with LN in sustained clinical renal remission, we strongly recommend quantifying proteinuria every 3–6 months.

### Canadian Society of Nephrology commentary on the KDIGO clinical practice guideline for CKD evaluation and management [^4d0cd0c1]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

We congratulate the KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) work group on their comprehensive work in a broad subject area and agreed with many of the recommendations in their clinical practice guideline on the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease. We concur with the KDIGO definitions and classification of kidney disease and welcome the addition of albuminuria categories at all levels of glomerular filtration rate (GFR), the terminology of G categories rather than stages to describe level of GFR, the division of former stage 3 into new G categories 3a and 3b, and the addition of the underlying diagnosis. We agree with the use of the heat map to illustrate the relative contributions of low GFR and albuminuria to cardiovascular and renal risk, though we thought that the highest risk category was too broad, including as it does people at disparate levels of risk. We add an albuminuria category A4 for nephrotic-range proteinuria and D and T categories for patients on dialysis or with a functioning renal transplant. We recommend target blood pressure of 140/90mm Hg regardless of diabetes or proteinuria, and against the combination of angiotensin receptor blockers with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. We recommend against routine protein restriction. We concur on individualization of hemoglobin A1c targets. We do not agree with routine restriction of sodium intake to < 2g/d, instead suggesting reduction of sodium intake in those with high intake (> 3.3g/d). We suggest screening for anemia only when GFR is < 30mL/min/1.73m(2). We recognize the absence of evidence on appropriate phosphate targets and methods of achieving them and do not agree with suggestions in this area. In drug dosing, we agree with the recommendation of using absolute clearance (ie, milliliters per minute), calculated from the patient's estimated GFR (which is normalized to 1.73m(2)) and the patient's actual anthropomorphic body surface area. We agree with referral to a nephrologist when GFR is < 30mL/min/1.73m(2) (and for many other scenarios), but suggest urine albumin-creatinine ratio > 60mg/mmol or proteinuria with protein excretion > 1g/d as the referral threshold for proteinuria.

### Treatment of IgA nephropathy: a rapidly evolving field [^b0228853]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Optimization of Supportive Care

IgA nephropathy is a CKD with slow but relentless nephron damage as a consequence of inflammation and fibrosis. As in any other CKD, supportive care aimed at reducing cardiovascular risk, unloading the glomerular pressure, and counteracting the tubular consequences of proteinuria remains the cornerstone of the therapy. Optimal supportive care consists of lifestyle modifications with smoking cessation, dietary sodium and protein restriction, weight control and exercise, statins in patients with hypercholesterolemia, BP control, and proteinuria reduction with maximally tolerated RAASi. Its value was epitomized by the observation that more than a third of patients who underwent optimization of supportive care and RAASi during the run-in phase of the STOP-IgA nephropathy trial had substantial reductions in proteinuria such that they were ineligible for subsequent randomization. The initial approach to all patients with IgA nephropathy (except special populations, see below) therefore consists of optimization of supportive care for at least 3 months, with the understanding that the 3-month period starts when target BP has been achieved (Figure 3). On the basis of the compelling evidence for their nephroprotective effects, SGLT2 inhibitors should be an integral part of contemporary optimization of supportive care, particularly in patients who do not qualify for immunosuppressive treatment or have residual proteinuria despite immunosuppression. The promising results of sparsentan suggest that it also merits inclusion in the algorithm of stepwise optimization of nonimmunologic treatment. However, its high economic cost calls for judicious use. In our opinion, sparsentan should be prioritized for those patients at high risk of disease progression, either because they have chronic lesions not amenable to immunosuppression or they have severe active disease that fails to go into rapid remission with immunosuppressive therapy (Figure 3). Optimization of RAASi to further reduce proteinuria by combining angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and angiotensin II receptor blocker or adding a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist is at the discretion of the treating physician. At every step of the algorithm, diuretics may be added to control persistent hypertension.

Proteinuria collection and quantification practice points in glomerular disease — Practice Point 1.2.3: Random "spot" urine collections for PCR are not ideal as there is variation over time in both protein and creatinine excretion. Practice Point 1.2.4: First morning urine collections may underestimate 24-hour protein excretion in orthostatic proteinuria. Practice Point 1.2.5: When feasible, a reasonable compromise is to collect an "intended" 24-hour urine sample and measure PCR in an aliquot of the collection. Practice Point 1.2.6: There is no need to simultaneously and routinely quantify sodium excretion on each timed urinary collection, unless there is reason to suspect a failure to adhere to suggestions regarding dietary sodium restriction (Figure 5 and Practice Points 1.4.2 and 1.5.9). Practice Point 1.2.7: Quantify proteinuria in glomerular disease, as it has disease-specific relevance for prognosis and treatment decision-making. Qualitative assessment of proteinuria may be useful in selected instances.

Practice Point 3.4.3 — peri- and post-transplant monitoring and treatment of recurrence in membranous nephropathy (MN) outlines surveillance steps and therapy triggers. Monitoring includes "Measure proteinuria every month" and, in known PLA2Rab-associated MN, "measure PLA2Rab every 1–3 months depending on pretransplant antibody status", with trend-based biopsy guidance: "PLA2Rab increasing → increased likelihood of recurrence, consider early kidney biopsy" and "PLA2Rab decreasing → lower likelihood of recurrence, perform kidney biopsy only if clinically indicated". Treatment directives list "Treat with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin II-receptor blocker" and "Ensure adherence to the transplant immunosuppression regimen, including monitoring drug levels". Proteinuria thresholds specify "Proteinuria < 1 g/d → evaluate/monitor at 1–3 month intervals" and "Proteinuria > 1 g/d → rituximab 1 g at day 1 and day 15".

International considerations affecting CKD detection and monitoring — in low- and middle-income regions and lower sociodemographic quintiles there is a large gap between CKD burden and provision of adequate healthcare, with limited access to kidney replacement therapy (KRT) and substantial sex and gender disparities in access to CKD treatment; the majority of the world's CKD population is in LMIC where diagnostic and treatment resources are constrained, and a global survey reported that fewer than 1 in 4 surveyed countries had facilities for routine measurements of serum creatinine (SCr) or proteinuria.

KDIGO 2024 CKD — result confirmation and accurate quantification: There is biological and analytical variability in urine albumin and urine protein loss, and all of these can lead to false detection of CKD or its progression; thus, positive tests should be confirmed, especially in people without risk factors for CKD. Change in creatinine concentration in the urine can also lead to observed changes in ACR or PCR, independently of changes in protein loss, and if a more accurate quantification of albuminuria or total proteinuria is required, measure urine albumin or total protein in a timed collection under supervised conditions as recommended above.

### Primary care approach to proteinuria [^817bb16a]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Proteinuria is a common finding in primary care practice. Most adolescents who are diagnosed with proteinuria through screening urinalysis do not have renal disease, and the proteinuria will usually resolve on repeat testing. In contrast, proteinuria is suggestive of kidney disease in patients with diabetes mellitus, hypertension, primary renal disease, or other systemic illnesses. Quantification of proteinuria can be used longitudinally to monitor therapeutic effects of treatment of the underlying disease. Given the multitude of clinical settings in which proteinuria can occur, we suggest an algorithm that may help clinicians differentiate between benign and serious etiologies of proteinuria.

The KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Glomerular Diseases represents the first update to this set of recommendations since the initial set of KDIGO guideline recommendations was published in 2012. The pace of growth in our molecular understanding of glomerular disease has quickened and a number of newer immunosuppressive and targeted therapies have been introduced since the original set of guideline recommendations, making such an update necessary. Despite these updates, many areas of controversy remain. In addition, further updates since the publication of KDIGO 2021 have occurred which this guideline does not encompass. With this commentary, the KDOQI work group has generated a chapter-by-chapter companion opinion article that provides commentary specific to the implementation of the KDIGO 2021 guideline in the United States.

### Tailored management strategies for IgA nephropathy based on clinical presentations [^d9fa5de8]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2025). Medium credibility.

The treatment landscape for immunoglobulin A nephropathy is rapidly evolving with the introduction of novel therapies targeting diverse disease pathways. Some have already been approved in different countries, while others are under investigation in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with encouraging results. However, almost all performed RCTs have included only patients with refractory non-nephrotic proteinuria and preserved renal function. Other clinical presentations (rapidly progressive forms, malignant hypertension, thrombotic microangiopathy, nephrotic syndrome) have received less attention and are systematically excluded from RCTs. In contrast, certain aspects, such as the impact of haematuria or management in special populations (e.g. pregnant patients or transplant recipients), remain underexplored. This review proposes therapeutic algorithms to guide treatment decisions in different clinical scenarios while highlighting gaps in current research.

### Determination of bence Jones protein in the urine… [^bf5f56ad]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Although the introduction of electrophoretic methods has led to a much improved characterization of the abnormal globulins which occur in patients with multiple myeloma, the simple determination of the presence of Bence Jones protein in the urine has remained as important as ever for the diagnosis of multiple myeloma. This remarkable thermolabile protein, with a molecular weight of 44. 000, is present in 50 to 60% of patients with myeloma. Bence Jones protein must be distinguished from the myeloma globulins, with a molecular weight of 160. 000 or greater, that are present in the serum. Irrespective of electrophoretic criteria, the diagnosis of Bence Jones protein in the urine must be accepted if a protein is present which precipitates between 45 and 60 C and dissolves again between 90 and 95 C. In our experience, the presence of Bence Jones protein proves the diagnosis of Snapper I, Ores RO. DETERMINATION OF BENCE JONES PROTEIN IN THE URINE. JAMA.

### Social determinants of health: addressing unmet needs in nephrology [^fda52f4e]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

There is ongoing recognition that a wide array of social, economic, and environmental factors influence individuals' opportunities to engage in health care and healthy behaviors. Despite spending $34 billion annually on the care of patients with end-stage renal disease, the American public and nephrology community remain remarkably complacent about addressing "upstream" factors that influence the prevention, progression, and treatment of chronic kidney diseases. Recently, a growing number of health plans and dialysis providers have begun to embrace population health management; accept greater accountability for health, health care, and health costs; and envision kidney health beyond their traditional roles in care delivery. This narrative offers a framework to evaluate social determinants of health and understand their link to chronic kidney diseases and provides recommendations for integrating social determinants into clinical care and delivery settings to assist vulnerable patients with broad social needs. Addressing unmet social needs with the same intention as treating hypertension, proteinuria, or anemia represents an important step toward making optimal health a palpable reality for all people who are at risk for or affected by chronic kidney diseases.

### KDOQI clinical practice guidelines and clinical practice recommendations for diabetes and chronic kidney disease [^fd079d11]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2007). Medium credibility.

Recommendations for Diabetes and CKD — albuminuria/proteinuria change and clinical outcomes — secondary analyses from the RENAAL trial and IDNT have directly correlated albuminuria/proteinuria reduction with clinical benefit, yet in the opinion of the Work Group, there currently is insufficient evidence to assume that lowering albuminuria levels will necessarily lead to improvements in clinical outcomes such as progression to CKD stage 5, CVD events, or death. Conversely, the failure to reduce albuminuria does not preclude a beneficial clinical effect on diabetic kidney disease (DKD), and to be considered efficacious, potential treatments for DKD must demonstrate benefits not only on albuminuria reduction but also on clinical end points such as CKD stage 5, CVD events, or death.

Evaluation of albuminuria — initial testing, confirmation, and interpretation: Use the following measurements for initial testing of albuminuria (in descending order of preference), and in all cases, a first void in the morning midstream urine sample is preferred. If measuring urine protein, use urine protein-to-creatinine ratio (PCR), reagent strip urinalysis for total protein with automated reading, or reagent strip urinalysis for total protein with manual reading. Use more accurate methods when albuminuria is detected using less accurate methods, confirm reagent strip positive albuminuria and/or proteinuria by quantitative laboratory measurement and express as a ratio to urine creatinine wherever possible, and confirm ACR ≥ 30 mg/g (≥ 3 mg/mmol) on a random untimed urine with a subsequent first morning void in the morning midstream urine sample.

### KDIGO 2022 clinical practice guideline for diabetes management in chronic kidney disease [^773c803f]. Kidney International (2022). High credibility.

IgA nephropathy (IgAN) management — proteinuria and renin–angiotensin system blockade: Recommendation 2.3.2: We recommend that all patients with proteinuria > 0.5 g/d, irrespective of whether they have hypertension, be treated with either an ACEi or ARB (1B). This recommendation is supported by evidence that higher proteinuria correlates with worse outcomes and that lowering proteinuria improves survival, including data showing improved 10-year kidney survival in patients with sustained proteinuria of 0.5–1 g/d compared to > 1 g/d, with 10-year dialysis-free survival of 94% (95% CI: 90%–98%) and 20-year dialysis-free survival of 89% (95% CI: 82%–96%). Additional supportive evidence in IgAN includes an RCT of 44 patients where an ACEi (enalapril) improved kidney outcomes versus alternative antihypertensives and an RCT of 109 Asian patients where an ARB (valsartan) reduced proteinuria and slowed kidney deterioration versus placebo; registry studies also show lower annual loss of kidney function with ACEi use. There are no RCT data for dual ACEi+ARB blockade in IgAN, and a post hoc analysis of the STOP-IgAN trial demonstrated no additional benefit with dual blockade.

Do not assume chronicity based upon a single abnormal level for estimated GFR (eGFR) and albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR), as the finding could be the result of a recent acute kidney injury (AKI) event or acute kidney disease (AKD). Consider initiation of treatments for CKD at first presentation of decreased GFR or elevated ACR if CKD is deemed likely due to presence of other clinical indicators.

Early detection of any chronic disease, including CKD, provides greater opportunities to reduce morbidity as treatments can be initiated earlier in the disease course, and knowledge of level of albuminuria and GFR also helps guide clinical decisions beyond initiating treatments specifically for CKD. Thus, initial testing of blood and urine to detect CKD is important, with confirmatory testing if initial findings indicate the presence of abnormalities of creatinine/eGFR or albuminuria.

### Microalbuminuria constitutes a clinical action item for clinicians in 2021 [^16f7b6c2]. The American Journal of Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Chronic kidney disease affects approximately 10% of the population or 800 million people globally, with diabetes being the leading cause. The presence of chronic kidney disease with impaired kidney function or with albuminuria is associated with an increased risk of a progressive loss of renal function and increased risk of cardiovascular disease and excess mortality. Screening for chronic kidney disease is critically important because during the initial stages patients often have no symptoms and because we now have available recently approved multiple interventions that can reduce the high risks dramatically. Screening should be performed with regular measurement of albumin in the urine and creatinine or cystatin C in blood for estimation of kidney function. Regretfully recent data indicates that screening for albuminuria is conducted in only 20%-50% of people at risk depending on the setting. Clinicians need to perform regular screening and concomitant management of risk factors. Recent therapeutic options must be implemented to improve outcomes. Finally, a reduction in albuminuria after initiation of intervention constitutes a treatment target because it indicates improved prognosis.

KDIGO 2022 — Practice Point 1.2.1 (glomerulonephritis): Obtain 24-hour urine collection to determine total protein excretion in patients with glomerular disease for whom initiation or intensification of immunosuppression is necessary, or who have a change in clinical status. Quantification of proteinuria is described as important, and most GN trials use 24-hour collections. If a 24-hour collection cannot be obtained, use an alternative method; the best option is PCR on an aliquot of an attempted 12-24-hour collection at first presentation or on a first morning void, and random "spot" PCR assessments are discouraged unless tightly standardized conditions are met.

### Chronic kidney disease [^c982bc57]. Lancet (2012). Excellent credibility.

Chronic kidney disease is a general term for heterogeneous disorders affecting kidney structure and function. The 2002 guidelines for definition and classification of this disease represented an important shift towards its recognition as a worldwide public health problem that should be managed in its early stages by general internists. Disease and management are classified according to stages of disease severity, which are assessed from glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and albuminuria, and clinical diagnosis (cause and pathology). Chronic kidney disease can be detected with routine laboratory tests, and some treatments can prevent development and slow disease progression, reduce complications of decreased GFR and risk of cardiovascular disease, and improve survival and quality of life. In this Seminar we discuss disease burden, recommendations for assessment and management, and future challenges. We emphasise clinical practice guidelines, clinical trials, and areas of uncertainty.

### Urine protein: creatinine ratio vs 24-hour urine protein for proteinuria management: analysis from the phase 3 REFLECT study of lenvatinib vs sorafenib in hepatocellular carcinoma [^a34bef79]. British Journal of Cancer (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The mechanism underlying VEGFR-inhibitor-associated proteinuria are unclear, but may involve thrombotic microangiopathy or impairment of podocyte function. However, proteinuria is a manageable adverse event that does not typically lead to clinically meaningful adverse outcomes if it is appropriately monitored and managed. The regression model of the UPCR versus 24-hour urine protein data suggests a strong and statistically significant correlation between the 2 measurements, and using a UPCR cut-off value of 2.4 to delineate between grade 2 and 3 proteinuria and the need for further testing would obviate the need for the more burdensome 24-hour urine collection for an estimated 74% of patients with urine protein dipstick results of ≥ 2+.

Introduction of UPCR into the guidelines for proteinuria management could be as follows and as described in Supplementary Table 2: urine dipstick testing would be performed as regularly scheduled. A 24-hour urine collection or an immediate spot UPCR test would be required in the case of: (1) first occurrence of ≥ 2+ proteinuria while on lenvatinib; (2) a subsequent increase in severity of urine dipstick proteinuria while on the same dose level; (3) when following a lenvatinib dose reduction, the urine protein dipstick result was ≥ 2+. In addition, a 24-hour urine collection should be initiated as soon as possible (within 72 h) when UPCR is ≥ 2.4 to verify the grade of proteinuria. After the proteinuria has improved to a lower grade, lenvatinib may be restarted at a reduced dose. By following these criteria, proteinuria can be safely managed, enabling optimisation of lenvatinib treatment while minimising inconvenience to patients. It should also be noted that, although this analysis was conducted in patients with HCC, this monitoring approach may potentially be useful in other tumour types treated with lenvatinib (e.g. differentiated thyroid cancer or renal cell carcinoma).

### KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease [^574078ad]. Kidney International (2024). High credibility.

KDIGO 2024 chronic kidney disease (CKD) risk-based referral criteria — Practice Point 2.2.1 states, "A 5-year kidney failure risk of 3%–5% can be used to determine need for nephrology referral in addition to criteria based on eGFR or urine ACR, and other clinical considerations". Figure 15 illustrates a transition from an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)-based to a risk-based approach, with risk-based criteria including "KF risk ≥ 3%–5% 5 years", "KF risk ≥ 10% 2 years", and "KF risk ≥ 40% 2 years", and eGFR-based steps such as "Transition from primary care to nephrology care", "Transition from nephrology care to interprofessional care", and "Access and transplant planning". Because "only a small fraction of the CKD population is at high risk for progression to kidney failure", those with lower risk "may be effectively managed in primary care settings with guideline-based treatments to delay CKD progression", and "Referral criteria for nephrology services that include a risk threshold of 3%–5% over 5 years have been examined retrospectively and have also been implemented respectively in several healthcare settings", with "settings within Canada and the UK" reporting these thresholds "avoided harms from nonreferral or delayed referral of those progressing to kidney failure".

### Evaluating the application and clinical practice of adapted national preeclampsia and eclampsia guideline; a cross-sectional study from iran [^19e4511a]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hypertensive disorders during pregnancy (HDP) are a significant cause of maternal mortality worldwide, contributing to an estimated 62,000 to 77,000 deaths annually and accounting for 18% of all maternal deaths. HDP not only poses serious risks of severe morbidity and long-term disability but also result in high rates of maternal and fetal mortality. While gestational hypertension is the most prevalent HDP, preeclampsia remains the most challenging to manage. Preeclampsia, a progressive disorder affecting multiple systems, is characterized by the sudden onset of hypertension and proteinuria or hypertension with significant end-organ dysfunction, with or without proteinuria typically occurring after 20 weeks of gestation or postpartum. Eclampsia, which manifests as generalized tonic-clonic seizures or coma in patients with preeclampsia or gestational hypertension, adds further complexity and risk.

Both preeclampsia and eclampsia contribute significantly to preterm birth, cesarean deliveries, long-term maternal cardiovascular complications, and perinatal mortality. Early diagnosis, along with prompt and appropriate management, including timely delivery is essential in mitigating the severe consequences of these conditions. Clinical guidelines are instrumental in improving healthcare quality by guiding the planning, delivery, and evaluation of care. Specifically, preeclampsia and eclampsia guidelines provide healthcare providers with the tools for timely diagnosis and effective management, enhancing pregnancy outcomes. Additionally, guidelines serve to direct healthcare resources toward evidence-based practices, optimizing patient care.

The adoption of clinical guidelines often requires shifts in healthcare providers' practices, a critical step toward improved care quality. Effective guideline implementation depends on several factors, including the specific content, the healthcare providers themselves, the operational environment, and individual patient needs. The likelihood of successful implementation increases when guidelines are aligned with key enabling factors. Improving guideline applications not only enhances care quality but also maximizes the returns on investments made by healthcare organizations worldwide to develop these standards.

This study, the first nationwide investigation in Iran focused on the assessment of healthcare providers' ability to apply preeclampsia and eclampsia guidelines (Supplementary File 1). Our research examines the extent of guideline use across different healthcare provider groups, aiming to provide evidence-based recommendations for better guideline implementation and to address related barriers like disbelief in guideline, non-practical content of guideline, mother's non-compliance, and lack of facilities.

### Abstract… [^7083ffe7]. AAFP (2017). Low credibility.

The presence of protein in urine is a common laboratory finding in children. Although proteinuria is usually benign, it can be a marker of a serious underlying renal disease or systemic disorder. 1–3 Albumin and immunoglobulin G in the urine are the usual indicators for glomerular diseases. Glomerular diseases can have nephrotic and/or nephritic features, and distinguishing these features can help narrow the differential diagnosis. Nephrotic syndrome is characterized by heavy proteinuria, edema, hypoalbuminemia, and hyperlipidemia. 1, 2, 17 The test primarily detects albuminuria, with a specificity and sensitivity of more than 99%, but it is not sensitive for other proteins.

18 The intensity of color changes from yellow to blue correlates with the amount of protein in the urine: trace, 1+, 2+, 3+, and 4+. The sulfosalicylic acid test detects all forms of protein and is generally used as a supplementary test when the presence of a low-molecular-weight or other protein is suspected but not detected by the dipstick urine test. In the sulfosalicylic acid method, three drops of a sulfosalicylic acid 20% solution are added to 5 mL of urine. Depending on the amount of protein precipitated, various grades of turbidity, from minimal to heavy flocculation, are noted. 9, 17. A spot, first-morning urine sample is optimal for determining UPr/Cr ratio or UPr-to-osmolality ratio because it excludes any postural effect on the protein component.

The spot UPr/Cr or UPr-to-osmolality ratio is a convenient and reliable method for estimating urine protein excretion without a 24-hour urine collection. 16, 19–21 To estimate the total amount of protein in the urine, the UPr/Cr ratio can be multiplied by 0.

### Progression, remission, regression of chronic renal diseases [^5141877c]. Lancet (2001). Excellent credibility.

The prevalence of chronic renal disease is increasing worldwide. Most chronic nephropathies lack a specific treatment and progress relentlessly to end-stage renal disease. However, research in animals and people has helped our understanding of the mechanisms of this progression and has indicated possible preventive methods. The notion of renoprotection is developing into a combined approach to renal diseases, the main measures being pharmacological control of blood pressure and reduction of proteinuria. Lowering of blood lipids, smoking cessation, and tight glucose control for diabetes also form part of the multimodal protocol for management of renal patients. With available treatments, dialysis can be postponed for many patients with chronic nephropathies, but the real goal has to be less dialysis-in other words remission of disease and regression of structural damage to the kidney. Experimental and clinical data lend support to the notion that less dialysis (and maybe none for some patients) is at least possible.

### Initial toxicity assessment of ICON6: a randomised trial of cediranib plus chemotherapy in platinum-sensitive relapsed ovarian cancer [^70174d89]. British Journal of Cancer (2011). Low credibility.

Dose modifications

Patients discontinued trial drug permanently if they developed gastrointestinal perforation, arterial thromboembolic events (e.g. myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident or transient ischaemic attack), reversible posterior leucoencephalopathy syndrome or grade 4 toxicity secondary to trial drug (e.g. hypertension, proteinuria or haemorrhagic event). The trial drug was reduced to 15 mg if patients developed any grade 3 toxicity secondary to the trial drug. A delay in treatment for longer than 2 weeks due to toxicity resulted in permanent discontinuation of trial drug.

At the start of the trial, relatively little was known about the safety of cediranib in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy in ovarian cancer. Stage I was therefore restricted to a small number of selected sites, in the United Kingdom and Canada, experienced in management of patients with advanced ovarian cancer and early phase clinical trials. Clinical guidance for the management of known common dose-limiting toxicities of hypertension, diarrhoea, fatigue and proteinuria were developed. These guidelines were provided for use by clinicians and nurses alongside the clinical protocol, with detailed steps on how to manage common toxicities. In general, short dose interruptions (i.e. 2–5 days) of trial drug were recommended for the management of adverse events. Once symptoms had resolved to CTCAE grade 1 with supportive care, the trial drug could be restarted. For management of hypertension, patients were provided with a blood pressure monitor for home monitoring and instructed to call their primary care or hospital physician if the self-checked BP exceeded 140/90 mm Hg. A detailed algorithm for initiation of appropriate antihypertensive treatment was provided for management of hypertension.

### Identifying acute kidney injury in children: comparing electronic alerts with health record data [^5eb53c53]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

AKI is associated with later adverse outcomes such as hypertension, proteinuria, and chronic kidney disease, for which there are treatments that can help reduce disease progression. As children stand to gain important long-term benefits from early detection, understanding how e-alerts can be used to facilitate AKI recognition is urgently needed. Among adult patients, e-alerts are variably implemented and rarely incorporate instructions for clinical care, however systematic review findings suggest they could modify processes of care, particularly when intermediate steps are incorporated. This potential has been demonstrated among paediatric cohorts: Goldstein and colleagues successfully demonstrated a 64% reduction in AKI incidence and 38% decrease in nephrotoxin exposure for 'at-risk' children when an e-alert prompted follow-up blood test monitoring, suggesting that e-alerts, in conjunction with active management, may improve AKI rates. At hospital level, marked variation in the percentage of AKI episodes coded in the clinical record was noted, which may be due in part to how alerts are implemented clinically at individual hospitals and whether there are services or personnel available to support to AKI recognition and management. Understanding differences in clinical and coding practices for hospitals with high and low coding rates is required to drive quality improvements in clinical care, which will aid future disease surveillance.

### Albuminuria predicts kidney events in IgA nephropathy [^0bd3945a]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2025). Medium credibility.

KEY LEARNING POINTS

What was known:

Immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN) is the most common etiology of primary glomerular diseases and a major cause of kidney failure worldwide.
Proteinuria is a widely recognized risk factor for progression to kidney failure. KDIGO recommends proteinuria < 1 g/d as a treatment target in patients with IgAN because of the high risk of progression to kidney failure.
However, whether low-grade proteinuria predicts adverse kidney outcomes in IgAN remains insufficiently studied.

This study adds:

There is a strong and incremental association between urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (uACR) and the risk of adverse kidney events.
A substantial risk of kidney failure is already seen in patients with uACR between 0.3 and 1.0 g/g, a population currently considered at low risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression.
Any reduction in uACR, irrespective of baseline uACR, is associated with better kidney outcomes.

Potential impact:

Our results inform clinical decisions for risk stratification and optimization of clinical and pharmacological management to delay the risk of CKD progression in IgAN.
Our findings provide a rational to re-evaluate the current risk-based treatment target of proteinuria < 1 g/d in IgAN.

### Criteria-based audit on management of eclampsia patients at a tertiary hospital in dar es salaam, tanzania [^170b50b1]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2009). Low credibility.

Audit procedure

The audit was performed following a criteria-based audit framework. Clinical audit is the systematic and critical analysis of the quality of medical care, including the procedures used for diagnosis and treatment, the use of resources and the resulting outcome and quality of life for the patient. It follows this cycle of events:-

Figure 1: Audit cycle

Figure 1
Audit Cycle

Step no 1

In March 2006 a meeting was convened in the department with all doctors and nurses/midwives to agree on evidence-based criteria on management of eclampsia using the Ministry of Health (MOH) guidelines, local management guidelines, the WHO manual supplemented by the WHO Reproductive Health Library CD-ROM no.8, standard textbooks, the Cochrane database and reviews in peer reviewed journals. A set of 14 standards (Additional file 1: Appendix 1) was developed which addressed quality issues related to the management of eclampsia. The standards were set according to the prevailing local setting and according to available resources. Two workshops were conducted to inform the department members on the standards, each workshop involved 50 doctors, nurses, and midwives.

Step no 2

The aim of this step was to evaluate the current practice. Data were collected by a medical doctor (senior resident) trained for the purpose. Socio-demographic data were collected by interviewing the relative accompanying the patient using a structured questionnaire. Case files were reviewed and compared against the standards, comprehensive information like antenatal care, events during antepartum and intrapartum period as well as pregnancy outcome was obtained by the principal investigator from case notes and summary. Furthermore, information was collected on gestational age at delivery, number of eclamptic seizures, blood pressure on admission, proteinuria at the antenatal clinic and on admission, gestational age at diagnosis of eclampsia, use of antihypertensive drugs, delivery complications, mode of delivery, Apgar score, birth weight, time interval between admission and delivery, and perinatal and maternal morbidity and mortality. Mothers were followed up till discharge and all babies referred to the neonatal ward were followed up for seven days to collect data on early neonatal deaths, and the causes of neonatal deaths. Cause of death was selected from the case notes as recorded by the doctor who certified the death. A post-mortem examination was not performed. The admission book was used to check if all admitted cases were included.

Step no 3

The results of the first audit were presented to members of the department at a specially convened unit meeting and recommendations for improvement were made.

It emphasizes that "Only RASi has been extensively studied in appropriately powered trials", while "There was only 1 relevant direct renin inhibitor study, comparing aliskiren to the ARB losartan… and there were no events in either arm". The "overall quality of the evidence comparing ACEi or ARB with placebo or standard of care in patients with CKD and severely increased albuminuria without diabetes is moderate", and it "was downgraded because of study limitations, such as small numbers of events, inadequate reporting of sequence generation, and allocation concealment".

Practice Point 1.1.3.2 directs: "Do not assume chronicity based upon a single abnormal level for eGFR and ACR, as the finding could be the result of a recent acute kidney injury (AKI) event or acute kidney disease (AKD)". Practice Point 1.1.3.3 advises to "Consider initiation of treatments for CKD at first presentation of decreased GFR or elevated ACR if CKD is deemed likely due to presence of other clinical indicators". The guideline clarifies timing by stating, "We explicitly use the 3 months (> 90 days) as defining "chronic" kidney disease", and adds that "repeat ascertainment of GFR and kidney damage is recommended for accurate diagnosis and staging".

Albuminuria and proteinuria assessment in HIV-infected persons — detection of albuminuria or proteinuria is the most common method of detecting kidney damage, and KDIGO guidelines recommend albuminuria as the preferred marker for staging CKD. Urine dipstick provides a semiquantitative measure but can substantially underestimate or overestimate true protein excretion depending on hydration status. Twenty-four–hour urine collections are the reference standard for measuring urinary excretion of albumin or protein; the adequacy of a 24-hour collection can be assessed against expected creatinine excretion of 20–25 and 15–20 mg/kg/day in men and women, respectively. The most clinically useful methods for quantifying excretion are the albumin-to-creatinine and the protein-to-creatinine ratios performed on random urine samples; albumin-to-creatinine ratios from random samples (ideally first morning) correlate closely with 24-hour collections. On average, humans excrete approximately 1 g of creatinine in the urine each day, so albumin or protein to creatinine ratios correspond to total daily excretion.

### Management of hepatitis C virus infection in patients with chronic kidney disease: position statement of the joint committee of Italian Association for the Study of the Liver (AISF), Italian society of internal medicine (SIMI), Italian society of infectious and tropical disease (SIMIT) and Italian society of nephrology (SIN) [^538ed1b2]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2018). Low credibility.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is now considered a systemic disease due to the occurrence of extra-hepatic manifestations. Among these, the renal involvement is frequent. HCV infection, in fact, is strongly associated with proteinuria and chronic kidney disease (CKD) and negatively affects the prognosis of renal patients. In the last few years, availability of more specific and effective drugs against HCV has dramatically changed the clinical course of this disease. These drugs may provide further advantages in the CKD population as a whole by reducing progression of renal disease, mortality rate and by increasing the survival of graft in renal transplant recipients. The strict pathogenetic and prognostic link between HCV infection and CKD requires an ongoing relationship among the healthcare professionals involved in the treatment of both HCV infection and CKD. Therefore, Scientific Societies involved in the care of this high-risk population in Italy have organized a joint expert panel. The aim of the panel is to produce a position statement that can be used in daily clinical practice for the management of HCV infected patients across the whole spectrum of renal disease, from the conservative phase to renal replacement treatments (dialysis and transplantation). Sharing specific evidence-based expertise of different professional healthcare is the first step to obtain a common ground of knowledge on which to instate a model for multidisciplinary management of this high-risk population. Statements cover seven areas including epidemiology of CKD, HCV-induced glomerular damage, HCV-related renal risk, staging of liver disease in patients with CKD, prevention of transmission of HCV in hemodialysis units, treatment of HCV infection and management of HCV in kidney transplantation.

Taking these largely indirect findings together and considering that, at least after development of proteinuria, progression of kidney injury tends to follow the same course in different situations, the 2023 ESH Guidelines suggest that: (i) the BP target for proteinuric nondiabetic CKD applies to patients with proteinuric diabetic kidney disease as well and (ii) for both patient categories, a target SBP of < 130 mmHg and DBP < 80 mmHg, if well tolerated, can be associated with protection against CKD progression in individuals with an albuminuria > 30 mg/g. A similar target may be associated with a reduction in mortality in most patients with CKD. Particularly in patients with advanced CKD (G4 and G5), careful monitoring of eGFR is recommended as a further functional, but reversible, decline of GFR may occur on a lower BP. Finally, most of the patients with CKD have CV comorbidities that require respective target BP values to be taken into account, and thus these CV comorbidities and not CKD protection may primarily guide the target BP in an individual patient.

However, the 2023 ESH Guidelines acknowledge that these recommendations have a number of limitations: (i) none of the trials comparing different BP targets included patients with diabetes and CKD, thus current evidence cannot be readily extrapolated to this subpopulation; (ii) MDRD and AASK trials randomized participants to different mean BP levels, which cannot be readily extrapolated to SBP and DBP values; (iii) MDRD and AASK trials recruited patient populations of a relatively young age (mean age 51.7 and 54.6 years, respectively), and thus, their findings cannot be readily extrapolated to older patients with CKD; and (iv) even for the long-term observational analyses, the benefits associated with lower BP targets were mainly apparent in individuals with proteinuria.

Overall, as shown in Fig. 2, the guidelines recommend that in all patients with CKD the primary goal is to lower office SBP to < 140 mmHg and DBP < 90 mmHg (CoR I, LoE A) and that in most CKD patients (young patients, patients with a urine ACR ≥ 300 mg/g, high CV risk patients) office BP may be lowered to < 130/80 mmHg if tolerated (CoR II, LoE B). Actively targeting an office SBP target of < 120 mmHg and DBP < 70 mmHg cannot be recommended because of the absence of relevant evidence and the potential to induce harm (CoR III, LoE C).

### The KDIGO practice guideline on glomerulonephritis: reading between the (guide) lines – application to the individual patient [^dd974ea3]. Kidney International (2012). Low credibility.

The KDIGO guideline for glomerulonephritis is designed to assist health-care providers in treating patients with glomerular diseases. A guideline is not a set of rules but is intended to allow the practitioner to make an informed decision based on the available evidence. Due to its general nature and the variability of strength of the available studies, it is often difficult to directly apply a guideline to the care of an individual patient. This commonly relates to the limited generalizability of the evidence, i.e., does not cover every clinical scenario. To underscore this point, we have introduced within the context of the glomerulonephritis guideline cases with specific features to illustrate the constant need for clinical judgment. These vignettes are intended to demonstrate how the best treatment plans should be individualized and take into account patient preference and clinical acumen, as well as the best available evidence.

### Clinical practice guidelines for chronic kidney disease in adults: part II. glomerular filtration rate, proteinuria, and other markers [^bfc530ae]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

The Kidney Disease Outcome Quality Initiative of the National Kidney Foundation published clinical practice guidelines on chronic kidney disease in February 2002. Of the 15 guidelines, the first six are of greatest relevance to family physicians. Part II of this two-part review covers guidelines 4, 5, and 6. Glomerular filtration rate is the best overall indicator of kidney function. It is superior to the serum creatinine level, which varies with age, sex, and race and often does not reflect kidney function accurately. The glomerular filtration rate can be estimated using prediction equations that take into account the serum creatinine level and some or all of specific variables (age, sex, race, body size). In many patients, estimates of the glomerular filtration rate can replace 24-hour urine collections for creatinine clearance measurements. Urine dipsticks generally are acceptable for detecting proteinuria. To quantify proteinuria, the ratio of protein or albumin to creatinine in an untimed (spot) urine sample is an accurate alternative to measurement of protein excretion in a 24-hour urine collection. Patients with persistent proteinuria have chronic kidney disease. Other techniques for evaluating patients with chronic kidney disease include examination of urinary sediment, urine dipstick testing for red and white blood cells, and imaging studies of the kidneys (especially ultrasonography). These techniques also can help determine the underlying cause of chronic kidney disease. Family physicians should weigh the value of the National Kidney Foundation guidelines for their clinical practice based on the strength of evidence and perceived cost-effectiveness until additional evidence becomes available on the usefulness of the recommended quality indicators.

Pediatric albuminuria/proteinuria testing — Practice Point 1.3.1.4: In children, obtain a first morning urine sample for the initial testing of albuminuria and proteinuria in descending order of preference as follows: both urine protein-to-creatinine ratio (PCR) and urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR); reagent strip urinalysis for total protein and for albumin with automated reading; or reagent strip urinalysis for total protein and for albumin with manual reading. PCR is advised and preferred as initial screening for children because many have congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT) and a higher proportion have tubular proteinuria, and testing for ACR may miss tubular proteinuria.

4 CLINICAL RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE EVALUATION AND MANAGEMENT OF PREGNANT INDIVIDUALS HETEROZYGOUS FOR ALPORT SYNDROME P/VARIANTS

Although there are recommendations available for the clinical management of adults with Alport P/LP variants, (Nozu et al.) there are currently no published recommendations specifically for the evaluation and management of the pregnant person with an Alport syndrome P/LP gene variant. We present the following recommendations for evaluating and managing these individuals during and after pregnancy, as well as for evaluating and managing the pregnant person's family and the child or children resulting from the pregnancy; these recommendations are summarized in Figure 1. We recognize that individual circumstances, such as access to nephrologists and genetic counselors and insurance coverage limitations, may cause variation in implementing these recommendations.

FIGURE 1
Potential management algorithm for individuals with positive carrier screenings for Alport syndrome. GA, gestation; P/LP, pathogenic/likely pathogenic.

4.1 Management of individuals identified with P/variants in the obstetric setting

Proteinuria is a key risk factor for kidney disease progression in people with a COL4A3–5 variant, and in a pregnant person may be associated with an increased chance for preeclampsia and development of nephrotic syndrome levels of proteinuria. Screening for proteinuria by urine protein–creatinine ratio (UPCR) should ideally occur before pregnancy or at least before 20 weeks gestation. Proteinuria (UPCR > 0.3 mg/mg or 300 mg/g) present before pregnancy or before 20 weeks gestation indicates the presence of kidney disease, while proteinuria appearing after 20 weeks gestation could be due to Alport syndrome‐associated, new onset proteinuria or preeclampsia. Pregnant persons with new onset proteinuria should be evaluated and followed for hypertension, and kidney function should be evaluated through serum creatinine measurements. When proteinuria is present before pregnancy or 20 weeks' gestation, the patient should be referred to nephrology and managed using existing clinical practice guidelines for kidney disease during pregnancy (Fitzpatrick et al; Schmidt et al; Wiles et al.). Prophylactic low‐dose aspirin should also be considered for prevention of preeclampsia (Rolnik et al.).

4.2 Management of individuals with P/variants outside of pregnancy

In the absence of proteinuria, annual screening for onset of proteinuria by a primary care provider or a nephrologist is recommended. Individuals who develop proteinuria should be referred to nephrology for management. Postpartum individuals whose proteinuria appears after 20 weeks' gestation should be referred to nephrology if proteinuria does not resolve within 6 weeks of delivery (Cífková).

### Chronic kidney disease: detection and evaluation [^6247d02d]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Chronic kidney disease affects an estimated 27 million adults in the United States, and is associated with significantly increased risk of cardiovascular disease and stroke. Patients should be assessed annually to determine whether they are at increased risk of developing chronic kidney disease based on clinical and sociodemographic factors. Diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and older age are the primary risk factors that warrant screening. Other risk factors include cardiovascular disease, family history of chronic kidney disease, and ethnic and racial minority status. Serum creatinine levels can be used to estimate the glomerular filtration rate, and spot urine testing can detect proteinuria. After the diagnosis of chronic kidney disease is made, staging based on estimated glomerular filtration rate determines prognosis, evaluation, and management. Further evaluation should focus on the specific type of kidney disease and on identifying complications related to the disease stage. Patients should be assessed for risk factors leading to the further loss of kidney function and cardiovascular disease. Patients with estimated glomerular filtration rates less than 30 mL per minute per 1.73 m(2), significant proteinuria, or rapid loss of kidney function should be referred to a nephrologist for further evaluation and management.

### Detection and evaluation of chronic kidney disease [^a1365abd]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Chronic kidney disease affects approximately 19 million adult Americans, and its incidence is increasing rapidly. Diabetes and hypertension are the underlying causes in most cases of chronic kidney disease. Evidence suggests that progression to kidney failure can be delayed or prevented by controlling blood sugar levels and blood pressure and by treating proteinuria. Unfortunately, chronic kidney disease often is overlooked in its earliest, most treatable stages. Guidelines from the National Kidney Foundation's Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) recommend estimating glomerular filtration rate and screening for albuminuria in patients with risk factors for chronic kidney disease, including diabetes, hypertension, systemic illnesses, age greater than 60 years, and family history of chronic kidney disease. The glomerular filtration rate, calculated by using a prediction equation, detects chronic kidney disease more accurately than does the serum creatinine level alone; the glomerular filtration rate also is used for disease staging. In most clinical situations, analysis of random urine samples to determine the albumin-creatinine or protein-creatinine ratio has replaced analysis of timed urine collections. When chronic kidney disease is detected, an attempt should be made to identify and treat the specific underlying condition(s). The KDOQI guidelines define major treatment goals for all patients with chronic kidney disease. These goals include slowing disease progression, detecting and treating complications, and managing cardiovascular risk factors. Primary care physicians have an important role in detecting chronic kidney disease early, in instituting measures to slow disease progression, and in providing timely referral to a nephrologist.

### Low-protein diets for chronic kidney disease patients: the Italian experience [^989cd829]. BMC Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Diabetes

Diet and lifestyle modifications are key components of DM care and an optimal nutritional approach helps the management of blood glucose, lipids, body weight and blood pressure, thus reducing both the incidence and progression of DM complications, including CKD.

The Italian Guidelines for DM Care suggest that people at high risk of diabetes should be encouraged to follow a diet rich in fiber from vegetables, fruits and whole grains and low in animal fats. The first step in managing a diet for a DM patient in an early stage of CKD is to ensure that carbohydrate intake is within the recommended range of 45%-60% of total calories and the actual fiber intake is similar to that of the general population (14 g/1000 kcal/day). Dietary sodium and protein restriction should be a mainstay in the nutrition therapy of all patients with proteinuria and it has proven effective even in overt diabetic nephropathy. When CKD progresses, a high protein intake is detrimental for the progressive decline of renal function. Indeed, the Italian DM Standard Care, and the Canadian Diabetes Association guidelines, recommend a LPD in the clinical management of DM patients with CKD although the benefits of protein-restricted diets have long been debated.

### Improved quality of management of eclampsia patients through criteria based audit at muhimbili national hospital, dar es salaam, tanzania. bridging the quality gap [^4aff89dc]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2012). Low credibility.

Method

Audit procedure

The audit was performed following a criteria-based audit framework. Clinical audit is the systematic and critical analysis of the quality of medical care, including the procedures used for diagnosis and treatment, the use of resources and the resulting outcome and quality of life for the patient. It follows this cycle of events: Figure 1.

Figure 1
Audit cycle.

Setting the standard (step 1)

In March 2006 a meeting was convened in the department with all doctors and nurses/midwives to agree on evidence-based criteria on management of eclampsia using the Ministry of Health (MOH) guidelines, local management guidelines, the WHO manual supplemented by the WHO Reproductive Health Library CD-ROM no.8, standard textbooks, the Cochrane database and reviews in peer reviewed journals. A set of 14 standards (Table 1) was developed which addressed quality issues related to the management of eclampsia. The standards were set according to the prevailing local setting and according to available resources. Two workshops were conducted to inform the department members on the standards. Each workshop involved 50 doctors, nurses, and midwives.

Step no 2

The aim of this step was to evaluate the current practice. Data were collected by a medical doctor (senior resident) trained for the purpose. Socio-demographic data were collected as documented in case notes. Case files were reviewed and records compared against the standards, comprehensive information like antenatal care, events during antepartum and intrapartum period as well as pregnancy outcome was obtained by the principal investigator from case notes and summary. Furthermore, information was collected on gestational age at delivery, number of eclamptic seizures, blood pressure on admission, proteinuria at the antenatal clinic and on admission, gestational age at diagnosis of eclampsia, use of antihypertensive drugs, delivery complications, mode of delivery, Apgar score, birth weight, time interval between admission and delivery, and perinatal and maternal morbidity and mortality. Records on all babies referred to the neonatal ward were reviewed to collect data on early neonatal deaths. Cause of perinatal death was selected from the case notes as recorded by the doctor who certified the death. A post-mortem examination was not performed. The admission book was used to check if all admitted cases were included.

Evaluation of albuminuria — definition and initial testing — states that albuminuria refers to abnormal loss of albumin in the urine defined as albumin ≥ 30 mg/g [≥ 3 mg/mmol]. Practice Point 1.3.1.1: Use the following measurements for initial testing of albuminuria (in descending order of preference). In all cases, a first void in the morning midstream sample is preferred in adults and children: urine ACR, or reagent strip urinalysis for albumin and ACR with automated reading. If measuring urine protein, use the following measurements: urine protein-to-creatinine ratio (PCR), reagent strip urinalysis for total protein with automated reading, or reagent strip urinalysis for total protein with manual reading.
