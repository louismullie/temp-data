## Question

What are the potential gastrointestinal side effects of semaglutide that may impact colonoscopy preparation?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which gastrointestinal side effects of semaglutide may impact colonoscopy preparation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core pharmacology of semaglutide and how it alters GI motility. Then, I should verify which GI adverse effects are most common and clinically relevant. Next, I will examine direct evidence on bowel preparation quality and inadequate preparation rates in GLP-1 RA users. After that, I need to check procedural safety considerations, especially aspiration risk and sedation planning. Finally, I will synthesize practical, guideline-aligned recommendations and note areas of controversy and uncertainty where evidence is evolving [^112tGoA3] [^111H9z97] [^113YqL8n].

> Let me first confirm the mechanism that plausibly links semaglutide to colonoscopy prep problems. Semaglutide, a GLP-1 receptor agonist, slows gastric emptying and can reduce intestinal motility, which is integral to its glycemic and weight effects but also creates a risk of retained gastric contents and altered transit of oral purgatives, potentially impairing cleansing of the colon [^112tGoA3] [^115qobHV] [^117DprtW].

> I need to check which GI adverse effects are most frequent and likely to intersect with prep tolerance. Very common effects include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and constipation; these are dose-dependent and cluster during dose escalation, with nausea and vomiting peaking early and constipation persisting longer, which can complicate adherence to large-volume prep solutions and contribute to dehydration risk during prep [^1168vF5k] [^112e2b1L] [^114yGTBy].

> Next, I should review direct evidence on bowel preparation quality. Hold on, let me verify the magnitude of effect. Multiple studies and meta-analyses show GLP-1 RA users have higher odds of inadequate bowel preparation and lower Boston Bowel Preparation Scale scores; for example, pooled analyses report roughly a 2-fold increase in inadequate prep and a clinically meaningful BBPS reduction of about 0.3–0.4 points, translating into more repeat colonoscopies and missed lesions if not addressed [^113h67qV] [^113fKHWj] [^113gykoJ] [^116fmRZC] [^115Txpkd].

> Wait, let me verify the aspiration risk piece because it is often conflated with colonoscopy prep. Although aspiration is classically an upper endoscopy/anesthesia concern, semaglutide is associated with increased residual gastric contents despite fasting, and cohort data show higher odds of retained gastric contents and procedure discontinuation or rescheduling; while aspiration events are rare, the anesthesia risk profile justifies pre-procedural planning and, in some cases, medication holds or modified fasting strategies [^114UeSdC] [^1133kWMX] [^1121vc8X].

> I should confirm what the guidelines say about holding GLP-1 RAs before procedures. The ASA suggests holding GLP-1 RAs 1–7 days before elective procedures depending on agent and half-life, but given semaglutide's ~7.6-day half-life, a 1-week hold may still leave supraphysiologic receptor activity; the AGA advises individualized decisions rather than universal cessation, and some experts propose a clear-liquid diet the day before or rapid-sequence strategies if the drug is not held, underscoring the lack of a one-size-fits-all answer [^111H9z97] [^113YqL8n] [^115vVagu] [^116Pabs9].

> Let me consider practical prep adjustments that could mitigate the motility effects. Extending the prep timeline, splitting the dose with additional clear liquids, and ensuring aggressive hydration can help counter slower transit; patient education on early symptom management for nausea and constipation before prep day may improve adherence and outcomes, though I should acknowledge that high-quality prospective data on the optimal modified regimen are limited [^notfound].

> But wait, what if we stop semaglutide too far ahead and lose glycemic control or prompt weight regain? I need to ensure we balance risks. For patients with diabetes or obesity where uninterrupted therapy is important, a case-by-case approach with clear liquids the day prior and procedural planning for potential retained contents may be preferable to a blanket hold, especially since even a 1-week pause may not fully normalize gastric emptying given semaglutide's pharmacokinetics [^115vVagu] [^113YqL8n].

> I should double-check the clinical consequences of inadequate prep to frame the risk-benefit discussion. Inadequate preparation reduces polyp and adenoma detection, increases need for repeat colonoscopy, raises costs, and can delay cancer diagnosis; GLP-1 RA users in several cohorts had higher repeat procedure rates, reinforcing the need to anticipate and mitigate prep failure rather than react after the fact [^113gykoJ] [^116fmRZC] [^113fKHWj].

> Let me synthesize a pragmatic, reference-aligned approach. For elective colonoscopy, discuss holding semaglutide for about 1 week if glycemic and weight risks allow, recognizing the evidence gap and the potential for residual effect; if continued, plan a split-dose prep with extended clear-liquid intake, reinforce hydration, and coordinate with anesthesia for aspiration precautions. For urgent cases, assume delayed gastric emptying, use a liquid-only diet the day before, and consider rapid-sequence intubation if sedation is required. Document shared decision-making about holding the medication and the possibility of repeat colonoscopy if prep is suboptimal [^111H9z97] [^113YqL8n] [^115vVagu].

> Hold on, I should verify areas of uncertainty so we don't overstate conclusions. Meta-analyses are largely based on observational data and show heterogeneity, with one analysis concluding no significant increase in inadequate prep events while still finding lower BBPS, highlighting conflicting signals; thus, institutional protocols may reasonably vary pending stronger prospective trials, and patient-specific factors like diabetes, opioids, and BMI should guide individualized plans [^112a3tLM] [^113h67qV] [^113fKHWj].

> In summary, semaglutide's delay of gastric emptying and associated GI symptoms meaningfully increase the risk of inadequate colonoscopy preparation and procedural complexity; proactive planning, tailored prep regimens, and coordinated sedation strategies are warranted, with guideline-concordant, case-by-case decisions about holding therapy and explicit counseling about the possibility of repeat procedures if prep quality is suboptimal [^112tGoA3] [^113h67qV] [^111H9z97] [^113YqL8n].

Semaglutide's gastrointestinal side effects — especially **delayed gastric emptying** [^112tGoA3] and **constipation** [^115Zc18N] — can impair colonoscopy preparation by increasing the risk of **inadequate bowel cleansing** [^113h67qV] and **retained gastric contents** [^114UeSdC], which may necessitate repeat procedures or additional prep. Nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain can reduce tolerance of prep solutions, and delayed gastric emptying may prolong prep duration or require split-dose regimens [^notfound]. To mitigate these risks, **hold semaglutide 1–7 days before colonoscopy** [^111H9z97] per ASA/AGA guidance [^113YqL8n], use split-dose or extended prep [^notfound], and ensure adequate hydration [^113vfVjH]; patients with severe GI symptoms or gastroparesis may need longer holds or alternative strategies [^115vVagu].

## Gastrointestinal side effects of semaglutide

Semaglutide commonly causes **GI side effects** that can affect colonoscopy preparation:

- **Delayed gastric emptying**: Slows gastric emptying [^112tGoA3], increasing risk of retained gastric contents and aspiration during sedation [^111SBeRy].

- **Nausea and vomiting**: Very common (> 10%) [^115Zc18N], reducing tolerance of large-volume prep solutions [^notfound].

- **Constipation**: Common (1–10%) [^1129u4U7], potentially worsening prep quality and increasing repeat procedures [^113gykoJ].

- **Abdominal pain and distension**: Common (1–10%) [^notfound], further limiting prep intake [^notfound].

---

## Impact on colonoscopy preparation

Semaglutide's GI effects can **impair prep quality** and procedural safety:

- **Inadequate bowel cleansing**: Delayed gastric emptying and constipation increase inadequate prep risk [^113h67qV], reducing visualization and increasing repeat procedures [^113gykoJ].

- **Retained gastric contents**: Higher risk of retained food/liquid despite fasting [^114UeSdC], raising aspiration risk during sedation [^111SBeRy].

- **Increased repeat procedures**: Poor prep often leads to repeat colonoscopy, increasing burden and cost [^113gykoJ].

---

## Clinical evidence and guidelines

Recent studies and guidelines provide **practical recommendations**:

- **ASA guidance**: Hold GLP-1 RAs 1–7 days before elective procedures to reduce aspiration risk; if not held, assume full stomach and plan accordingly [^111H9z97].

- **AGA guidance**: Case-by-case decision on continuing or withholding GLP-1 RAs; consider patient-specific factors and emerging data [^113YqL8n].

- **Clinical studies**: GLP-1 RA users have higher rates of inadequate prep and lower BBPS scores, supporting proactive management [^113h67qV] [^113fKHWj].

---

## Practical recommendations for clinicians

To optimize prep quality and safety, **clinicians should**:

- **Medication management**: Hold semaglutide 1–7 days before colonoscopy per ASA/AGA guidance, individualized to patient risk and GI symptoms [^111H9z97] [^113YqL8n].

- **Bowel preparation strategy**: Use split-dose or extended regimens [^notfound] to improve tolerance and cleansing, especially in patients with delayed gastric emptying or constipation.

- **Patient education**: Counsel on hydration, dietary adjustments, and symptom management to improve prep tolerance and reduce GI adverse effects [^113vfVjH].

- **Alternative strategies**: Consider low-volume preps, additional laxatives, or nasogastric administration for severe GI symptoms or gastroparesis [^notfound].

---

Semaglutide's GI effects — particularly delayed gastric emptying and constipation — can compromise colonoscopy preparation, increasing inadequate cleansing and aspiration risk. Proactive management, including **holding semaglutide**, using **split-dose or extended prep**, and ensuring hydration, can mitigate these risks and improve outcomes [^113h67qV].

2.4 Recommendations Regarding Missed Dose

If one dose is missed and the next scheduled dose is more than 2 days away (48 hours), administer WEGOVY as soon as possible. If one dose is missed and the next scheduled dose is less than 2 days away (48 hours), do not administer the dose. Resume dosing on the regularly scheduled day of the week.
If 2 or more consecutive doses are missed, resume dosing as scheduled or, if needed, reinitiate WEGOVY and follow the dose escalation schedule, which may reduce the occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms associated with reinitiation of treatment.

GLP-1 receptor agonists and bowel preparation timing: Newer agents such as GLP-1 receptor agonists that delay gastric emptying may affect when to cease drinking a bowel preparation purgative. The ASA advises that these agents be stopped for 1–7 days (depending on the agent) before an elective procedure to limit aspiration risk during sedation. When the agents have not been stopped, the advisement is to proceed with the assumption that the stomach is full.

Results

Among 70 individuals taking GLP-1RAs (mean [SD] age, 62.7 [12.2] years; 36 female) and 139 individuals in the control group (mean [SD] age, 62.7 [12.2] years; 36 female), the mean (SD) BMI was 34.4 (7.2) and 34.4 (7.2), respectively (Table). Among all individuals, 33% underwent EGD, 33% underwent colonoscopy, and 34% underwent both. In the GLP-1RA group, 46% received semaglutide, 30% received dulaglutide, 20% received tirzepatide, and 4% received liraglutide. Food retention occurred in 4 of 23 individuals (17.4%) in the GLP-1RA group undergoing EGD alone (1 moderate, 3 large) vs 0 of 46 individuals in the control group (odds ratio [OR], 21.5; 95% CI, 1.1–414.9; p = 0.01). No food retention was observed in combined EGD-colonoscopies (Figure).

3 RESULTS

3.1 Demographics and baseline characteristics (1‐4)

In total, 2117 participants were randomized to semaglutide 2.4 mg and 1262 to placebo within the STEP 1‐3 trials. In STEP 4, 902 participants entered the initial 20‐week semaglutide run‐in period; of these, 803 participants were subsequently randomized to continued semaglutide 2.4 mg (n = 535) or placebo (n = 268).

Baseline characteristics were similar in each trial, except that the STEP 2 population included fewer female participants, had lower BMI and higher age and glycated haemoglobin compared with STEP 1 and 3 (Table S1). In STEP 4, participant characteristics at randomization (week 20) were comparable between the continued semaglutide 2.4 mg and placebo arms (Table S1).

The majority of participants randomized to semaglutide 2.4 mg remained on treatment at week 68 in STEP 1‐3 (84.0%) and in STEP 4 (94.2%). Among these, most were receiving 2.4 mg once weekly (STEP 1‐3: 87.0%; STEP 4: 89.5%).

Safety Profile of Oral Semaglutide

As a result of the stimulation of GLP-1 receptors in the GI tract, semaglutide may directly influence GI motility, secretion, and sensitivity, contributing to GI symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or constipation, and abdominal discomfort. It also affects delaying gastric emptying, slowing the absorption of nutrients, but also causing feelings of fullness, bloating, and nausea.

GI side effects typically range from mild to moderate in severity, often occur temporarily, commonly beginning during the period of initiation and dose escalation and typically resolving after reaching the maintenance dose. The safety profile of oral semaglutide across the PIONEER clinical trials was consistent with the known profile of the GLP-1 RA class. Interruption of therapy as a result of GI tolerability issues was reported in 2–12% of patients in oral semaglutide groups.

The most frequently reported adverse events are GI manifestations such as nausea (15%), diarrhea (10%), and vomiting (7%). Data on side effects from observational studies are more heterogeneous. The diverse nature of real-world settings, patient populations, and treatment protocols in this type of study can contribute to a more varied and less standardized collection of side effect data. This variability may stem from differences in patient demographics, comorbidities, treatment adherence, and other factors, making the findings less uniform or consistent compared to the more controlled conditions of clinical trials.

In the Italian study by Candido et al. GI adverse events, nausea, and diarrhea were reported by 6.2% of patients, while hypoglycemic episodes occurred in 3% of patients. Discontinuation of oral semaglutide occurred in 10% of patients over 6 months; among these patients, almost 80% were due to an adverse event.

### AGA rapid clinical practice update on the management of patients taking GLP-1 receptor agonists prior to endoscopy: communication [^111SBeRy]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) and gastric emptying — background evidence relevant to endoscopy notes that patients may lose up to 20% of their weight and that patients taking GLP-1 RAs had delayed gastric emptying and increased residual gastric contents after an overnight fast, with a prospective study performed after having fasted for at least 10 hours. The normal stomach secretes up to 2–3 L of fluid/day and T1/2 for liquid gastric emptying is estimated at 23 minutes, whereas abnormal solid-food gastric emptying is described as > 60% retention at 2 hours and > 10% retention at 4 hours on scintigraphy studies; in a study comparing semaglutide with controls, a protective effect (0.25; 95% confidence interval, 0.16–0.39) against retained gastric contents was found in patients undergoing esophagogastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy. These findings imply an increased risk of aspiration in patients receiving GLP-1 RA medications when present for procedures that require sedation, and for severe gastroparesis scheduled for gastric peroral endoscopic myotomy it is advised that patients stop ingesting solid foods and be maintained on clear liquids only the day before their procedure.

### Relationship between perioperative semaglutide use and residual gastric content: a retrospective analysis of patients undergoing elective upper endoscopy [^1133kWMX]. Journal of Clinical Anesthesia (2023). Medium credibility.

Study Objective

Semaglutide is a long-acting glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist used for management of type 2 diabetes and/or obesity. To test the hypothesis that perioperative semaglutide use is associated with delayed gastric emptying and increased residual gastric content (RGC) despite adequate preoperative fasting, we compared the RGC of patients who had and had not taken semaglutide prior to elective esophagogastroduodenoscopy. The primary outcome was the presence of increased RGC.

Design

Single-center retrospective electronic chart review.

Setting

Tertiary hospital.

Patients

Patients undergoing esophagogastroduodenoscopy under deep sedation/general anesthesia between July/2021-March/2022.

Interventions

Patients were divided into two (SG = semaglutide, NSG = non-semaglutide) groups, according to whether they had received semaglutide within 30 days prior to the esophagogastroduodenoscopy.

Measurements

Increased RGC was defined as any amount of solid content, or > 0.8 mL/Kg (measured from the aspiration/suction canister) of fluid content.

Main Results

Of the 886 esophagogastroduodenoscopies performed, 404 (33 in the SG and 371 in the NSG) were included in the final analysis. Increased RGC was observed in 27 (6.7%) patients, being 8 (24.2%) in the SG and 19 (5.1%) in the NSG (p < 0.001). Semaglutide use [5.15 (95%CI 1.92–12.92)] and the presence of preoperative digestive symptoms (nausea/vomiting, dyspepsia, abdominal distension) [3.56 (95%CI 2.2–5.78)] were associated with increased RGC in the propensity weighted analysis. Conversely, a protective [0.25 (95%CI 0.16–0.39)] effect against increased RGC was observed in patients undergoing esophagogastroduodenoscopy combined with colonoscopy. In the SG, the mean time of preoperative semaglutide interruption in patients with and without increased RGC was 10.5 ± 5.5 and 10.2 ± 5.6 days, respectively (p = 0.54). There was no relationship between semaglutide use and the amount/volume of RGC found on esophagogastroduodenoscopy (p = 0.99). Only one case (in the SG) of pulmonary aspiration was reported.

Conclusions

Semaglutide was associated with increased RGC in patients undergoing elective esophagogastroduodenoscopy. Digestive symptoms prior to esophagogastroduodenoscopy were also predictive of increased RGC.

Suggested Strategies for Optimal Oral Semaglutide Administration

Ensuring that patients who start oral semaglutide therapy receive comprehensive education from their healthcare provider is crucial. This education should encompass various aspects such as instructions on timing and method of administration, expectations regarding efficacy and adverse events, preventive measures to minimize the occurrence of side effects and on how to address them promptly. Thus, thorough patient education not only enhances treatment adherence but also promotes proactive management of potential challenges, ultimately promoting better overall outcomes.

The different aspects, suggested by the experts, to consider in subjects starting therapy with oral semaglutide were the following:
Patient communication Adopt specific and proactive counseling as a key component in the management of patients with T2D initiating oral semaglutide treatment. Recommend and explain the dose escalation strategy, with a starting dose of 3 mg once daily for at least 1 month, which can be then increased to 7 mg. After at least 1 month the dose can be increased to a maintenance dose of 14 mg once daily if needed to further improve glycemic control and body weight. Staying longer than 1 month on the 7-mg dose may help diluting GI side effects, but should not delay the achievement of individual targets. Inform patients about the potential occurrence of GI side effects in the initial weeks of oral semaglutide treatment, particularly during dose escalation periods. Patients should be reassured that in most cases, GI symptoms are mild to moderate and typically resolve naturally over time, encouraging them to persist on treatment.
Method and timing of administration Communicate the specific instructions related to mode of administration and their importance to patients initiating oral semaglutide treatment, to guarantee an effective drug bioavailability. Underline the necessity for a pre-dose fasting condition (enough to have an empty stomach) and observing an additional fasting period of at least 30 min post-dose, along with avoiding pharmacological interactions to allow correct semaglutide absorption. Recommend taking the medication in a time slot based on patient daily routine, when the stomach is empty. Address the patient's lifestyle and needs, to evaluate whether taking oral semaglutide after the overnight fast is the most suitable option or whether an alternative dosing time could be considered. In the latter case, provide the patients with clear written dosing instructions, regarding pre- and post-dose fasting.
Dose escalation schedule Extend the escalation periods beyond the recommended duration, if tolerability concerns arise at lower doses, i.e. maintain longer than 1 month on 7 mg before increasing the dose to 14 mg. Reduce the dose temporarily if adverse events persist and resume dose escalation once the symptoms diminish or resolve.
Presence of diseases or conditions affecting adherence and prescription of therapy. Emphasize adherence to specific administration timing recommendations, such as taking oral semaglutide before any other oral medications and waiting for at least 30 min before other oral medications.
Adherence to recommended eating behaviors for patients with T2D (details reported in Table 1).

3.2 Incidence, timing and severity of any type of gastrointestinal adverse event (1‐3 pooled analysis)

A greater proportion of participants reported GI AEs in the semaglutide 2.4 mg arm compared with placebo: 72.9% and 47.1%, respectively (Table S2). Most GI AEs were non‐serious (99.5% of AEs) and mild or moderate in severity (98.1%) (Table S2). Severe GI AEs (namely nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhoea and vomiting) were reported by more participants in the semaglutide 2.4 mg arm (4.1% of participants) compared with the placebo arm (0.9%) (Table S2). GI AEs were reported more frequently within the dose‐escalation period, with the cumulative incidence of participants experiencing their first GI AE plateauing after week 20 (Figure 1A). Data for the 1.0 mg dose of semaglutide (STEP 2) are shown in Table S3 and Figure S2.

Subgroup and sensitivity analyses

We conducted three subgroup analyses. First, we stratified the analysis by type of sedation used during endoscopy, distinguishing between those who received anesthesia care services (current procedural terminology codes 00731 and 00740) and those who did not. Second, we evaluated BMI subgroups (< 30 and ≥ 30), excluding individuals with missing BMI data. Third, given the differences in the half-life and frequency with which GLP-1 receptor agonists are administered, we stratified the analysis based on the specific GLP-1 receptor agonist (subcutaneous semaglutide, dulaglutide, liraglutide, exenatide-lixisenatide, and tirzepatide) used within 30 days before endoscopy. Exenatide and lixisenatide were combined in the agent specific analysis owing to small sample sizes and similar short half-life.

In sensitivity analyses, we first restricted the cohort to patients who received a prescription dispensation for a GLP-1 receptor agonist or SGLT-2 inhibitor within 30 days before endoscopy, excluding those who had drug supply from a previously filled prescription but did not receive a dispensing during the 30 day assessment period for drug use. Second, we restricted the cohort to short term new users of GLP-1 receptor agonists or SGLT-2 inhibitors, defined as receiving a prescription dispensation within 12 weeks before endoscopy after a washout (no drug use) period of six months. Third, we restricted the cohort to persistent users of GLP-1 receptor agonists or SGLT-2 inhibitors, defined as receiving at least two prescriptions dispensations within six months before endoscopy. Fourth, owing to different preparations required for procedures, we repeated the study in two additional cohorts: a cohort of patients who had colonoscopy only, and a cohort of patients who had colonoscopy and upper endoscopy on the same day. Fifth, we excluded patients who were intubated during endoscopy as the decision to use endotracheal intubation is rare and affected by the duration and complexity of a procedure as well as the presence of respiratory comorbidities, making it difficult to ascertain if intubation was an a priori decision or related to a complication of the procedure. Finally, since delayed recording of aspiration pneumonia is possible, we increased the follow-up period to assess pulmonary aspiration as an outcome from one day to three days. For each of these analyses, we re-estimated propensity scores and reweighted study participants.

3.3 Incidence, timing and severity of most common gastrointestinal adverse events (1‐3 pooled analysis)

The most commonly reported GI AEs with semaglutide 2.4 mg were nausea, diarrhoea, vomiting and constipation (Table S2). Relative to the placebo arm, the prevalence of nausea, diarrhoea, vomiting and constipation in the semaglutide 2.4 mg arm were elevated throughout the 68‐week treatment period (Figure 2A‐D). The prevalence of nausea, diarrhoea and vomiting in the semaglutide 2.4 mg arm peaked at about week 20 and decreased thereafter, with the most prominent decline found for nausea (Figure 2A‐C). Individual nausea, diarrhoea and vomiting events were relatively short‐lived: in the semaglutide 2.4 mg arm, the median durations of nausea, diarrhoea and vomiting were 8, 3 and 2 days, respectively, and were similar to placebo (Figure 2A‐C). The median duration of constipation was longer: 47 days in the semaglutide arm and 35 days for placebo, with the prevalence plateauing at approximately week 10 (Figure 2D).

### Gastrointestinal effects of GLP-1 receptor agonists: mechanisms, management, and future directions [^112tGoA3]. The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

The availability of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists (RAs) such as liraglutide and semaglutide, and a GLP-1 and glucose dependent insulinotropic polypeptide coagonist (tirzepatide) represents a paradigm shift in the management of both type 2 diabetes and obesity. There is now considerable attention, including in the public media, on the effect of both long-acting and short-acting GLP-1RAs to delay gastric emptying. Although slowed gastric emptying is integral to reducing post-prandial blood glucose responses in type 2 diabetes, marked slowing of gastric emptying might also increase the propensity for longer intragastric retention of food, with a consequent increased risk of aspiration at the time of surgery or upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. This Personal View summarises current knowledge of the effects of GLP-1 and GLP-1RAs on gastrointestinal physiology, particularly gastric emptying, and discusses the implications for the development of sound pre-operative or pre-procedural guidelines. The development of pre-procedural guidelines is currently compromised by the poor evidence base, particularly in relation to the effect of long-acting GLP-1RAs on gastric emptying. We suggest pre-procedural management pathways for individuals on GLP-1RA-based therapy and discuss priorities for future research.

### Semaglutide (Wegovy) [^113yTgtX]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.6 Severe Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions

Use of WEGOVY has been associated with gastrointestinal adverse reactions, sometimes severe [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. In WEGOVY clinical trials in adults for weight reduction, severe gastrointestinal adverse reactions were reported more frequently among patients receiving WEGOVY (4.1%) than placebo (0.9%).

WEGOVY is not recommended in patients with severe gastroparesis.

5.7 Hypersensitivity Reactions

Serious hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis, angioedema) have been reported with WEGOVY. If hypersensitivity reactions occur, discontinue use of WEGOVY, treat promptly per standard of care, and monitor until signs and symptoms resolve. WEGOVY is contraindicated in patients with a prior serious hypersensitivity reaction to semaglutide or to any of the excipients in WEGOVY [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

Anaphylaxis and angioedema have been reported with other GLP-1 receptor agonists. Use caution in a patient with a history of anaphylaxis or angioedema with another GLP-1 receptor agonist because it is unknown whether such patients will be predisposed to these reactions with WEGOVY.

2.2 Study protocol and titration schedule

Each STEP trial included an initial dose escalation for semaglutide, with initiation at 0.25 mg once weekly for 4 weeks, increased at 4‐weekly intervals to 0.5 mg, 1.0 mg, 1.7 mg and finally 2.4 mg at week 16. Participants unable to tolerate 2.4 mg (i.e. would otherwise discontinue treatment) were permitted to remain at lower maintenance doses, with at least one attempt to re‐escalate to 2.4 mg. Participants discontinuing treatment prematurely remained in each trial.

AE information, including onset and end date, was collected throughout each trial, using open‐ended, non‐leading verbal questions. Reported AEs were proactively followed up at each subsequent visit/contact. AEs were coded using the current version of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (Version 22.1) and categorized based on severity and seriousness, using standard definitions (File S1). AE incidence was assessed as a supportive secondary safety endpoint in each trial.

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs; semaglutide and liraglutide) — titration, missed doses, and precautions are detailed as follows: To minimize risk of GI adverse effects, gradual dose titration is recommended for semaglutide and liraglutide. Semaglutide is started at 0.25 mg weekly for the first 4 weeks, followed by doses of 0.5 mg, 1.0 mg, and 1.7 mg weekly every 4 weeks at each dose, until the maintenance dose of 2.4 mg is reached after 16 weeks; for liraglutide, it is recommended to start with 0.6 mg daily for the first 7 days, followed by doses of 1.2 mg, 1.8 mg, and 2.4 mg daily every 7 days at each dose until the maintenance dose of 3.0 mg is reached after 4 weeks. If more than 2 consecutive doses are missed, clinical judgement is required to decide on subsequent dosing, and restarting the titration schedule should be considered if 3 or more consecutive doses are missed. Liraglutide or semaglutide should not be used with other GLP-1 RAs or with dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors; caution is advised when using GLP-1 RAs in combination with insulin or sulfonylureas, with dose adjustment and monitoring for hypoglycemia. Because GLP-1 RAs can delay gastric emptying, it may impact the absorption of some medications that require rapid onset of action, and GLP-1 RAs have been associated with thyroid C-cell tumors in rodents in dose- and treatment duration-dependent fashion.

3.4 Impact of gastrointestinal adverse events on dose and treatment adherence (1‐3 pooled analysis)

GI AEs led to dose reduction or temporary treatment interruption in 12.5% of participants in the semaglutide 2.4 mg arm versus 1.7% of participants in the placebo arm. GI AEs led to permanent treatment discontinuation in more participants in the semaglutide 2.4 mg arm (4.3%) than in the placebo arm (0.7%), with most discontinuations occurring during the dose‐escalation period in both arms (Figure 1B).

Almost all participants who experienced GI AEs in the semaglutide 2.4 mg arm continued and completed the trial (95.5%), with a similar completion rate among those who did not experience GI AEs (93.0%). The proportion of participants in the semaglutide 2.4 mg arm who completed the trials on treatment was similar for participants who experienced GI AEs (83.1%) and for those who did not (86.7%); most of these participants (83.7% and 96.0%, respectively) were receiving the 2.4 mg dose at week 68 (Table 1). Among the participants in the semaglutide arm who experienced a dose reduction or temporary treatment interruption owing to GI AEs, 74.0% subsequently completed the study on treatment (at completion, 60.2% reported taking a dose of ≥ 1.7 mg and 36.7% the 2.4 mg dose) (Table 1).

### Safety profile of semaglutide versus placebo in the SELECT study: a randomized controlled trial [^113WVd7s]. Obesity (2025). Medium credibility.

Gastrointestinal side effects were the main AEs driving treatment discontinuation in the SELECT study, which is consistent with other studies of GLP‐1RAs, although the incidence varies among studies. In the SELECT study, permanent treatment discontinuation due to gastrointestinal AEs was 10.0% in the semaglutide group versus 2.0% in the placebo group. This proportion is higher than that observed in the phase 3 STEP studies (0.8%–4.5% for semaglutide compared with 0.7%–1.2% for placebo). Treatment discontinuation due to gastrointestinal tolerability in SUSTAIN 6 was 5.7% and 9.4% for semaglutide 0.5 mg and 1.0 mg groups, respectively, and 1.2% and 1.0% for the corresponding placebo groups. Permanent treatment discontinuation primarily occurred during the 16‐week dose escalation due to gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting). The higher proportion of patients experiencing gastrointestinal AEs leading to discontinuation in the SELECT study compared with STEP is likely due to the longer study duration, limited dietary counseling intended to mitigate side effects, and differences in patient motivation and expectations (given that the SELECT study focused on MACE reduction rather than weight loss). Differences between the SELECT study and SUSTAIN 6 may be due to the higher dose of semaglutide (2.4 mg vs. 0.5 mg and 1.0 mg), longer study duration, and study population (without vs. with diabetes).

### Effect of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists on bowel preparation for colonoscopy: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113h67qV]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The impact of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) on colonoscopy bowel preparation is unclear.

Methods

We searched multiple databases for studies comparing bowel preparation quality between GLP-1RA users and the control group. Using a random-effects model, we calculated pooled odds ratios and mean differences with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Inadequate bowel preparation (IBP) rate was the primary outcome, and Boston Bowel Preparation Scale mean score was the secondary outcome.

Results

Five studies with 10,833 patients (n = 5,434 GLP-1RAs vs n = 5,399 control) were included. The IBP rate was higher in the GLP-1RAs group compared with the control group (odds ratios 2.10, 95% CI 1.41–3.13, P = 0.0003). Furthermore, the mean Boston Bowel Preparation Scale score was lower in the GLP1-RAs group compared with the control group (mean differences -0.34; 95% CI -0.51, -0.17; P = 0.0001).

Discussion

Our findings suggest that using GLP-1RA increases the risk of IBP.

### Anti-obesity medication protocols toolkit [^116436yo]. PES (2023). High credibility.

Semaglutide patient education — Semaglutide is used to treat diabetes and obesity in people 12 years old and older and has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). It works by copying the actions of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) to help lower appetite and increase metabolism, acting on the brain to make us feel a little bit less hungry, on the stomach to keep it full longer by emptying more slowly, and on the pancreas to help secrete a little bit more insulin to help manage blood sugars and use energy faster. The most common side effects of semaglutide are stomach upset, nausea, vomiting (throwing up), decreased appetite, indigestion, and constipation. If these effects occur, it may help to eat smaller meals and eat slower, take semaglutide with food, eat small meals or snacks throughout the day instead of one large meal, add fruits, vegetables, whole grains and lean proteins, and limit foods that are spicy, greasy or fried as well as packaged snacks like cookies, chips, cakes, doughnuts, and ice cream.

Adverse Effect Profile

In our study, 85 patients (48.6%) reported experiencing adverse effects associated with semaglutide. Gastrointestinal symptoms were the most reported adverse effects. Nausea and vomiting were the most encountered adverse events (64 patients [36.6%]), followed by diarrhea (15 patients [8.6%]) and fatigue (11 patients [6.3%]). Table 2 presents a detailed report of adverse effects. Moreover, 5 patients (2.9%) had to stop semaglutide because of the intolerability of the adverse effects, while 15 (8.6%) had to either reduce the dose or remain on the same dose to avoid exacerbation of the adverse effects.

### Bowel preparation quality in patients using glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112a3tLM]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) are now the mainstay treatment for many chronic conditions including diabetes mellitus, obesity, heart failure and chronic kidney disease. GLP-1 RAs may affect bowel preparation for a colonoscopy by modifying intestinal motility and gastric emptying. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the impact of GLP-1 RA use on bowel preparation quality, measured by the Boston Bowel Preparation Scale (BBPS), and the frequency of inadequate preparation events.

Methods

Multiple databases were searched for studies investigating the impact of GLP-1 RA on bowel preparation for colonoscopy. Primary end points included bowel preparation quality, measured by the Boston Bowel Preparation Scale (BBPS), and the frequency of inadequate preparation events. Random-effects model was used for statistical analysis.

Results

Six studies were included in the final meta-analysis. There was no significant difference in the pooled rate of inadequate bowel preparation events between the GLP-1 RA group and the control group (OR 1.00, 95% CI: 0.73–1.37, P = 0.99, I² = 33%). Mean BBPS score reported in three studies was significantly lower in the GLP-1 RA group (mean difference -0.36, 95% CI: -0.44 to -0.28, P < 0.001, I² = 91%).

Conclusion

GLP-1 RA use does not impact bowel preparation for colonoscopy as evident by our study. We do not recommend discontinuing GLP-1 RAs before colonoscopy. More evidence is needed to confirm the current findings.

3.5 Impact of gastrointestinal adverse events on weight loss (1‐3)

Among participants on treatment at week 68 with a body weight assessment, the observed placebo‐corrected weight loss from baseline to week 68 for semaglutide 2.4 mg was 14.4 percentage points in the STEP 1 trial, 7.6 percentage points in the STEP 2 trial and 12.7 percentage points in the STEP 3 trial. Weight loss appeared nearly as great in those without versus with GI AEs (Figure 3). In the semaglutide 2.4 mg arms, the mean change observed from baseline to week 68 in body weight in those with versus without GI AEs was −17.3% versus −15.7% in STEP 1, −11.4% versus −9.6% in STEP 2 and −17.7% versus −17.1% in STEP 3. Results were similar when weight change was analysed in participants with or without any of the three common GI AEs that were considered to possibly influence weight loss (nausea, diarrhoea and/or vomiting) (Figure 3).

FIGURE 3

Bars present the mean percentage change from baseline in body weight ± standard error of the mean. Body weight data are observed on‐treatment data (any dose of trial product within previous 2 weeks) among participants who had a week 68 body weight assessment. Gastrointestinal adverse events comprise any type of gastrointestinal disorder, including on‐treatment adverse events (for assessment of adverse events, participants were considered to be on treatment if any dose of trial product was administered within the previous 49 days). Additional information on these analyses is included in Table S4

Mediation analysis found that the vast majority of the weight‐loss effects of semaglutide 2.4 mg were because of effects unrelated to GI AEs. Overall, < 1 percentage point of semaglutide‐induced weight loss versus placebo was mediated by GI AEs, whether analysed based on the occurrence of any GI AE (Figure 4A) or the occurrence of nausea, diarrhoea and/or vomiting (Figure 4B). There was no notable difference in the magnitude of weight loss effect mediated by GI AEs between the STEP 1, 2 and 3 trials (Figure 4).

### Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists in the perioperative period: implications for the anaesthesiologist [^115kYT1Z]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Common side effects reported with GLP-1 RAs are nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea. These side effects are most often encountered during treatment initiation or after an increase in dosage. Initially, there was a suggested increased risk of acute pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer with GLP-1 RA use, but subsequent studies found no evidence for such risk.

Analogously, initial studies suggested an increased risk of gallbladder issues. A meta-analysis of 76 RCTs found higher chances of these problems with GLP-1 RA use, especially for long durations, higher doses, and weight loss.

GLP-1's effects on gastric emptying involve stimulating central nervous system GLP-1 receptors and brainstem vagal efferent fibres through the vagus nerve, possibly leading to slower emptying and raised intragastric volume.

Delayed gastric emptying represents a potential anaesthetic concern due to the increased risk of pulmonary aspiration. Gastric emptying delay, independent of GLP-1 RA administration, is not rare in diabetic patients, as it is a common diabetes-related complication present in around 40% of cases of long-standing type 1 and 2 diabetes. Thus, the addition of GLP-1 RAs in patients with preexisting gastroparesis risks exacerbating this phenomenon.

Nondiabetic overweight and obese patients are theoretically at lower risk of preexisting gastroparesis compared to diabetic patients, regardless of GLP-1 RA use. Indeed, a study assessing 2.4 mg of semaglutide once weekly in obese subjects showed the absence of delayed gastric emptying after 20 weeks of therapy, assessed indirectly via paracetamol absorption, when compared with subjects taking a placebo.

There is a growing number of case reports documenting episodes of perioperative pulmonary aspiration due to delayed gastric emptying in patients taking GLP-1 RAs. However, it remains uncertain if the GLP-1 RAs were the direct cause of pulmonary aspiration induced by increased gastric contents as long-standing diabetes was often present.

A retrospective study of 404 patients undergoing elective oesophagogastroduodenoscopies showed a significant increase in residual gastric contents in patients taking semaglutide for diabetes management or weight-loss when compared to control subjects. Of note, only one case of pulmonary aspiration was observed among all patients.

Anti-obesity medications targeting NuSH — liraglutide, semaglutide, and tirzepatide — are noted as the most effective among FDA-approved obesity medications and have robust long-term efficacy and safety data up to 4 years for managing obesity in those with and without cardiovascular disease. While all currently available medications were initially approved by the FDA to treat T2DM, they are also approved for obesity. These agents share a similar side effect profile of primarily gastrointestinal side effects (nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal pain, constipation) that can be mitigated with dose reductions or behavioral modifications such as hydration. On maximal doses, average weight loss is 8.0% with liraglutide, 14.9% with semaglutide, and 20.9% with tirzepatide. Liraglutide and semaglutide are GLP-1 receptor agonists.

### Comparative efficacy and tolerability of currently approved incretin mimetics: a systematic analysis of placebo-controlled clinical trials [^115kMvvX]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Of note, semaglutide is a unique compound available in both subcutaneous (s.c.) and oral formulations — the latter developed with an absorption enhancer to facilitate gastric uptake. The therapeutic efficacy and GI intolerance associated with the currently approved highest dose of oral semaglutide (14 mg daily) appear to be lower than those observed with the highest approved dose of s.c. semaglutide (1.0 mg weekly). However, a Phase 2 trial demonstrated that higher doses of oral semaglutide (10, 20 and 40 mg) produced reductions in HbA1c, FPG and body weight comparable with those seen with 1.0 mg weekly s.c. semaglutide. These findings suggest that, should future development support the approval of higher‐dose oral semaglutide, it may offer an effective alternative for patients who prefer non‐injectable therapies for diabetes management. However, additional studies would be needed to evaluate the relationship between therapeutic efficacy and GI intolerance with higher doses of oral semaglutide compared with its subcutaneous formulation.

While GI side effects are the most common AEs associated with GLP‐1 RAs, strategies to mitigate these effects have been recommended. For example, the American Diabetes Association (ADA) advises that GLP‐1 RAs should be titrated slowly to mitigate these GI side effects, particularly in older adults or those with pre‐existing GI conditions. Similarly, the American College of Cardiology (ACC) recommends gradual dose escalation and patient education on meal size to reduce the incidence of these adverse effects. Given the substantial weight loss, glycaemic and cardiovascular benefits consistently demonstrated in randomized, placebo‐controlled clinical trials (RCTs) of long‐acting GLP‐1 RAs, accurately understanding the trade‐offs is essential for practicing evidence‐based medicine in this high‐risk population. In this regard, the current study supports the use of newer incretin mimetics as first‐line options for patients with T2D, particularly those with obesity or difficulty achieving glycaemic control with other therapies. Given their greater efficacy and comparable tolerability, semaglutide and tirzepatide offer a favourable benefit–risk profile that can help address the dual challenges of hyperglycaemia and excess weight. Moreover, the absence of a strong correlation between efficacy and AE rates suggests that clinicians can prioritize more efficacious agents without substantially increasing the risk of treatment discontinuation due to GI AEs.

Practical Considerations for Optimal Use of Oral Semaglutide

Due to the formulation of oral semaglutide, clinicians need to be aware of specific considerations in its administration. As absorption of oral semaglutide is reduced if taken with food and large volumes of fluid, with higher levels of absorption from longer post-dose fasting period, individuals prescribed oral semaglutide should be informed that once-daily dosing is required at least 30 min before eating, drinking or taking other oral medicinal products. They should additionally be advised that the tablet should be swallowed whole (and should not be split, crushed or chewed) with up to half a glass of tap water (approximately 120 mL/4 fluid oz) to ensure it traverses the oesophagus (avoiding irritancy) and reaches the stomach to be absorbed. It is also possible that consuming more than the recommended 120 mL water may also adversely impact absorption. Thus, to ensure adherence to this instruction, it is imperative that the pack label includes the volume of water in the administration instructions. Furthermore, given the importance of adhering to the administration directions in achieving an effective bioavailability, it is vital that healthcare professionals, including pharmacists, effectively communicate these instructions and their importance to those initiating treatment with oral semaglutide.

Gradual dose escalation is recommended (and if a dose is missed, the missed dose should be skipped and the next dose should be taken the following day), with 3 mg tablets taken daily in the first month, increasing to a maintenance daily dose of 7 mg tablets in the second month and thereafter. After at least 1 month of 7 mg tablets once daily, the dose can be increased to a maintenance daily dose of 14 mg tablets to further improve glycaemic control if required (taking two 7 mg tablets to achieve the effect of one 14 mg dose has not been studied, but would increase the cost, and so is not recommended). This escalation will minimise gastrointestinal adverse reactions during the initial stages of treatment. While these reactions are typically mild to moderate and abate over time, monitoring of renal function in people with T2D experiencing severe gastrointestinal reactions is recommended in case of potential dehydration.

### The impact of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists on the quality indicators of colonoscopy-a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113fKHWj]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) are a newer class of glucose-lowering drugs with established cardiovascular benefit. However, their impact on bowel preparation quality remains controversial.

Aims

This article aimed to assess the association between GLP-1 RA use and colonoscopy quality indicators.

Methods

Electronic searches of PubMed and Embase were conducted up to January 2025. Clinical trials comparing colonoscopy quality indicators between GLP-1 RA users and controls were included. Non-English literature, meeting abstracts, and unpublished data were excluded. The primary outcome was the rate of inadequate bowel preparation; secondary outcomes included BBPS scores and adenoma/polyp detection rate (ADR/PDR).

Results

Six trials were included, involving 8778 GLP-1 RA users and 8290 controls. GLP-1 RA users had a higher rate of inadequate bowel preparation (risk difference = 0.06, 95% CI 0.05–0.08, p < 0.001, I² = 39%). Total BBPS scores were lower among GLP-1 RA users (mean difference = -0.31, 95% CI -0.39–0.23, p < 0.001, I² = 0%). Two studies reported increased ADR/PDR in GLP-1 RA users; one showed a neutral result.

Conclusion

GLP-1 RA is associated with inadequate bowel preparation. Further research is needed to establish the optimal GLP-1 RA washout period before colonoscopy.

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS

WEGOVY delays gastric emptying. May impact absorption of concomitantly administered oral medications. Use with caution. (7.2)

7.1 Concomitant Use with Insulin or an Insulin Secretagogue (e.g. Sulfonylurea)

WEGOVY lowers blood glucose and can cause hypoglycemia. The risk of hypoglycemia is increased when WEGOVY is used in combination with insulin or insulin secretagogues (e.g., sulfonylureas). The addition of WEGOVY in patients treated with insulin has not been evaluated.

When initiating WEGOVY, consider reducing the dose of concomitantly administered insulin secretagogue (such as sulfonylureas) or insulin to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4), Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

7.2 Oral Medications

WEGOVY causes a delay of gastric emptying and thereby has the potential to impact the absorption of concomitantly administered oral medications. In clinical pharmacology trials with semaglutide 1 mg, semaglutide did not affect the absorption of orally administered medications [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Nonetheless, monitor the effects of oral medications concomitantly administered with WEGOVY.

### The expanding role of semaglutide: beyond glycemic control [^115YUKJR]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Semaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA), has transformed the treatment landscape for type 2 diabetes and obesity due to its robust efficacy and wide-ranging therapeutic benefits. This review outlines semaglutide's diverse mechanisms of action, including its roles in glucose homeostasis, weight reduction, and cardiovascular protection. Data from the SUSTAIN and PIONEER clinical trials demonstrate significant reductions in HbA1c, body weight, and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), firmly establishing semaglutide as a key agent in diabetes management. The STEP trials further highlight its exceptional effectiveness in weight control, with participants achieving up to 20% weight loss alongside improvements in obesity-related comorbidities. Moreover, ongoing studies such as the FOCUS trial are investigating its impact on microvascular complications. Beyond glycemic control, semaglutide exhibits renoprotective, anti-inflammatory, and potential hepatoprotective effects. Emerging evidence also supports its expanding role in the management of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), heart failure, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), alcohol use disorder (AUD), and Alzheimer's disease. While gastrointestinal side effects are the most commonly reported adverse events, long-term studies affirm its overall safety and tolerability. The availability of both subcutaneous and oral formulations further enhances treatment adherence and accessibility. As a result, semaglutide has emerged as a cornerstone therapy for a broad spectrum of metabolic, cardiovascular, and neuroendocrine disorders. Future research should continue to explore its therapeutic potential in under-studied populations, including individuals with non-diabetic cardiovascular disease and hepatic fibrosis.

### Gastrointestinal tolerability of once-weekly semaglutide 2.4 mg in adults with overweight or obesity, and the relationship between gastrointestinal adverse events and weight loss [^1128uzRn]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

In clinical practice, GI AEs (most commonly nausea) are known to be a common reason for discontinuation of GLP‐1RA treatment. People with overweight or obesity must balance the typically short‐term impact of potential GI AEs against the significant health benefits offered by long‐term GLP‐1RA treatment. While physicians must establish a differential diagnosis to exclude other potential causes of GI symptoms (particularly if symptoms are prolonged/severe), adopting strategies to mitigate the impact of GI AEs and aid resolution is important to optimize persistence with GLP‐1RA treatment. A range of complementary approaches has been proposed, including: patient education and counselling on topics such as meal size and stopping eating when feeling full; gradual dose escalation; and dose adjustment with re‐escalation upon AE resolution.

This study has some limitations. First, the pooled analysis and mediation analyses were post hoc and should, therefore, be considered as exploratory analyses. Second, the time course of GI AEs was not fully accounted for in the analyses of contribution to weight loss. In addition, the descriptive analyses of the impact of GI AEs on body weight changes were only conducted in those who remained on treatment at week 68, and thus those who discontinued treatment before this time were excluded. Furthermore, the mediation analysis should be interpreted with caution, as it assumes no confounding factors beyond those included in the model (baseline body weight and stratification factors), which may not be the case, given that post‐randomization events (GI AEs) are used in the analysis. For the STEP 4 analyses, while the randomization to continued semaglutide or placebo was double‐blinded, participants were aware of this randomized withdrawal trial design, which could influence AE reporting. Finally, it should be noted that the STEP trials represent a controlled clinical trial environment with regular follow‐up, which may differ from routine clinical practice.

In conclusion, while GI AEs were common with semaglutide 2.4 mg across the STEP 1‐4 trials, effects were typically mild‐to‐moderate, non‐serious and transient, with few events leading to treatment discontinuation. The substantial weight‐lowering effects of semaglutide 2.4 mg appeared to be largely independent of GI AEs, both for any type of GI AE and for nausea, diarrhoea and/or vomiting specifically.

4.4.2 Gastroparesis and intestinal obstruction

Severe gastrointestinal symptoms, including gastroparesis and intestinal obstruction/ileus, have been anecdotally reported with GLP‐1RA use, with a pharmacovigilance signal for intestinal obstruction seen in WHO's VigiBase. These signals have not generally been observed in RCTsand there is currently sparse real‐world evidence existing from large epidemiological studies. A recent real‐world study of people with obesity compared initiators of semaglutide and liraglutide to those initiating bupropion‐naltrexone and found markedly increased rates of bowel obstruction (hazard ratio [HR] 4.22; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02–17.40) and gastroparesis (3.67 [95% CI, 1.15–11.90]). However, this study has been criticized for methodological shortcomings. The American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA)has, however, made recommendations to hold GLP‐1RA medications on the day of surgical procedures for daily users and a week prior to an elective procedure for weekly users to reduce the risk of gastroparesis.

### Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist cases reported to United States poison centers, 2017–2022 [^117XwXRY]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2024). Medium credibility.

Based on case review, the fatality reported in the NPDS appears to be consistent with complications of stercoral colitis, a rare condition that occurs when constipation and fecal impaction progresses to colonic distension and inflammation. In stercoral colitis, dehydrated fecal matter (i.e. fecalomas) can apply pressure to the bowel wall mucosa, causing ulceration, ischemia, necrosis, or perforation. Prompt recognition and management are critical to avoid morbidity and mortality. To our knowledge, this condition has not been previously described in the literature as being associated with GLP-1RA use. Although most cases of GLP-1RA-associated constipation do not progress to stercoral colitis, providers should be aware of the potential risk of this condition.

The high demand for GLP-1RAs has precipitated international drug shortages. Consequently, some patients have turned to compounding pharmacies, which advertise compounded versions of the peptides, for easier and cheaper access to these medications. In the spring of 2023, the FDA issued a warning on compounded semaglutide, citing a lack of FDA approval, reports of adverse effects, and an unknown safety profile. Concurrently, the Obesity Medicine Association issued a position statement reiterating the importance of a transparent drug supply with appropriate regulatory oversight; in its concluding statements, the Obesity Medicine Association recommended that prescribers and patients avoid "compounded polypeptides from undisclosed sources" and that patients should be informed of "potential limitations of compounded peptides". Further study and regulatory oversight are needed to ensure the safety and efficacy of the compounded peptide drug supply. In addition to concerns about the contents of compounded products and their safety, use of compounded semaglutide may place patients at greater risk of therapeutic errors. These products are offered in multidose vials, unlike the single-dose pen version of the FDA-approved product. Confusion about how to draw up the medication for self-injection and confusion about units (milliliters vs. milligrams vs. units) could lead to large — up to 10- or 20-fold — overdose of these products.

Adverse effects of GLP-1 RA and SGLT-2 inhibitor therapy in T2DM: Both classes of agents have notable side effects as well as associated adverse events. GLP-1 RA use is associated with significant gastrointestinal side effects (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) that often are mild, resolve over time, and can be modulated by appropriate patient selection (avoiding gastroparesis). A risk of cholelithiasis and acute cholecystitis increases slightly with dose and duration of treatment; no increased risk of pancreatitis, pancreatic cancer, or hypoglycemia with GLP-1 RA use was noted. Injectable semaglutide is associated with a slightly increased risk of progression of diabetic eye complications, theorized to reflect rapid improvement in glycemic control. SGLT-2 inhibitor use has been associated with an increased risk of mycotic genital infections (typically mild and easily treated) and a slightly increased risk of diabetic ketoacidosis, which can largely be mitigated with education not to take when oral intake is diminished, the patient is feeling unwell, during acute illness, before surgery, or combinations of these.

### Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists significantly affect the quality of bowel preparation for colonoscopy [^115Txpkd]. Endoscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) affect gastrointestinal motility, slowing gastric emptying and colonic transit. GLP-1RAs have an impact on gastric residue before endoscopy, but only limited data are available regarding its effect on the adequacy of colonic preparation. We investigated the association between GLP-1RA use and inadequate bowel preparation (IBP) for colonoscopy.

Methods

We performed a multicenter retrospective study with GLP-1RA cases matched with controls (using propensity scores for age, sex, diabetes mellitus [DM], obesity, and co-morbidities). Data on demographics, medication use, procedural indications, and colonoscopy findings were collected. IBP ("poor preparation" on Aronchik scale or Boston Bowel preparation scale < 5) was the primary outcome.

Results

4876 patients treated with GLP-1RAs were included in the analysis and compared with 4876 controls selected from 333 648 patients without GLP-1RA use. Among the GLP-1RA patients, 10% (n = 487) had IBP compared with 197 (4%) of the control group (P < 0.001). Subgroup analysis showed a higher rate of IBP among diabetic patients treated with GLP-1RA (284/2364 [12%]) than among diabetic patients without GLP-1RA treatment (118/2364 [5%]; P < 0.001). Additionally, 203/2512 nondiabetic patients treated with GLP-1RAs had IBP (8%) compared with 79 of the nondiabetic non-GLP-1RA group (3%; P < 0.001). On multivariate analysis, diabetes and GLP-1RA use were both found to be independent risk factors for IBP (odds ratio [OR] 1.4 and OR 2.7, respectively; both P < 0.001).

Conclusion

Our findings highlight the necessity for special attention and tailored recommendations for both diabetic and nondiabetic patients treated with GLP-1RAs in terms of colonic preparation prior to colonoscopy.

### Gastrointestinal tolerability of once-weekly semaglutide 2.4 mg in adults with overweight or obesity, and the relationship between gastrointestinal adverse events and weight loss [^116HkLue]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

These analyses provide a robust assessment of the GI tolerability of semaglutide 2.4 mg in ~2650 adults over 68 weeks and show that weight loss with semaglutide 2.4 mg was mostly attributable to effects unrelated to GI AEs.

Pooled data from the STEP 1‐3 trials demonstrate frequent reports of GI AEs in both semaglutide 2.4 mg and placebo arms, with nausea, diarrhoea, vomiting and constipation the most common side effects with semaglutide. The relatively high incidence of GI AEs in the placebo arms was not unexpected and may in part reflect the known underlying increased risk of GI disorders associated with obesity. While not assessed directly in our study, crude comparison of the incidences of GI AEs reported in the individual STEP 1, 2 and 3 trials, indicates between‐trial variation in incidences for both semaglutide 2.4 mg and placebo arms, which may reflect trial‐specific differences in design and patient populations.

Although GI AEs occurred more frequently with semaglutide 2.4 mg than with placebo across STEP 1‐4, the vast majority of GI AEs reported were non‐serious and mild‐to‐moderate in severity, and did not necessitate dose reduction or discontinuation. GI AEs were most prevalent during or shortly after dose escalation, declining in prevalence thereafter. While rates of nausea, diarrhoea and vomiting with semaglutide remained elevated compared with placebo throughout treatment, participants typically recovered from each event within a few days. Constipation tended to last longer, and may be because of the effects of GLP‐1RAs on GI motility. Among the participants who reported any GI AEs, the vast majority experienced their first event during the dose‐escalation period, suggesting that the elevated prevalence of GI AEs with semaglutide versus placebo after dose escalation is primarily because of additional events being reported by participants who have previously experienced a GI AE. Collectively, these results should reassure patients and physicians alike that GI AEs associated with semaglutide 2.4 mg are unlikely to be serious and will typically be transient, although a small proportion of patients may continue to experience GI AEs throughout treatment. Importantly, in STEP 1‐3, only 4.3% of participants in the semaglutide arm discontinued treatment prematurely because of GI AEs, with very few discontinuations occurring after dose escalation.

In conclusion, this trial showed that oral semaglutide significantly improves glucose and lipid metabolism and delays gastric emptying in subjects with T2D. These effects are expected to be clinically relevant, and are consistent with those shown with s.c. semaglutide and other GLP‐1RAs. The PK profile of oral semaglutide was as expected, and the safety profile was in line with the results of the global phase 3 PIONEER trials.

### Quality of bowel preparation for colonoscopy in patients on glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists [^116aMpvx]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

We aimed to assess the quality of bowel preparation in a matched cohort of patients actively using and not using glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) in a large health system in the United States.

Methods

We performed a retrospective review of adult patients undergoing colonoscopy in 22 endoscopy units across 18 sites in the United States.

Results

Our cohort comprised 6235 patients (3344 case patients and 2891 control patients). Baseline variables causing suboptimal bowel preparation were setting of procedure (inpatient), sex (male), body mass index (higher), type 2 diabetes mellitus, inflammatory bowel disease, opioid medications, heart failure, and cirrhosis. Total Boston Bowel Preparation Scale was significantly higher in control patients even after controlling for the mentioned variables (P < .01). Case patients were significantly more likely to meet the definition of inadequate bowel preparation. There was no significant difference between different classes of GLP-1 RAs.

Conclusions

Patients using GLP-1 RAs are more likely to have inadequate bowel preparation during colonoscopy, even accounting for other comorbidities.

### Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists before upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and risk of pulmonary aspiration or discontinuation of procedure: cohort study [^1121vc8X]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

Clinical implications

Importantly, we observed an increased risk for discontinuation of endoscopy among GLP-1 receptor agonist users compared with SGLT-2 inhibitor users (9.60 v 5.10 per 1000 people). The reason for discontinuation was not available in our data. Nonetheless this relative increase in risk among GLP-1 receptor agonist users suggests that to minimize the risk of pulmonary aspiration, endoscopists might be inclined to reschedule procedures when retained gastric contents are detected or suspected. Indeed, in a recent case report of retained gastric contents during elective endoscopy in preparation for bariatric surgery, the procedure was stopped owing to concerns about pulmonary aspiration. Although not a life threatening event, discontinuation of endoscopy can have several clinical and administrative implications, including delays in diagnosis and increased healthcare costs, as well as personal and societal economic costs such as missed workdays.

We also found that the increased risk for discontinuation of endoscopy might be modified by obesity. A higher risk of discontinuation was observed among those with a BMI ≥ 30 compared with a BMI < 30. GLP-1 receptor agonists have been on the market for nearly two decades, and concerns about the associated risk of pulmonary aspiration and retained gastric contents have surfaced only recently. Owing to their efficacy in lowering weight and their additional indication for the treatment of obesity, higher potency and higher dose GLP-1 receptor agonists are now being used specifically in patients with obesity. Given the inaccuracies in correctly identifying the dose regimen of GLP-1 receptor agonists from pharmacy dispensations, however, we were unable to conduct a subgroup analysis by dose of GLP-1 receptor agonist. Notably, the subgroup analyses suggested a higher risk for discontinuation of endoscopy associated with the higher potency GLP-1 receptor agonists subcutaneous semaglutide and tirzepatide. The risk of pulmonary aspiration and discontinuation of endoscopy should be assessed in future studies, with a focus on high potency GLP-1 receptor agonists.

### Superior weight loss with once-weekly semaglutide versus other glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists is independent of gastrointestinal adverse events [^116NxwmE]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2020). High credibility.

Given the clinical significance of weight loss in T2D management, it is important to understand the mechanism by which semaglutide provides greater weight loss versus class comparators and, in particular, whether it is mediated by GI AEs. A previous mediation analysis examining superior weight loss with semaglutide versus mixed class comparators by GI AEs in the SUSTAIN 1–5 trials showed that only 0.07 kg of 2.3 kg (semaglutide 0.5 mg) and 0.5 kg of 6.3 kg (semaglutide 1.0 mg) of the treatment difference in weight loss was mediated by nausea/vomiting.

To further determine if GI AEs of nausea/vomiting and others are associated with weight loss, we performed a post hoc mediation analysis to examine the extent to which the treatment difference with semaglutide versus the other GLP-1RAs in the SUSTAIN 3, 7 and 10 trials might be driven by a difference in GI AEs (indirect effects) or treatment (direct effect). Data on nausea and/or vomiting were pooled and data on nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation and dyspepsia were analyzed individually.

### Superior weight loss with once-weekly semaglutide versus other glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists is independent of gastrointestinal adverse events [^113cqVY5]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2020). High credibility.

Consistent with the GLP-1RA class, gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events (AEs) were the most frequently reported AEs in the SUSTAIN 3, 7 and 10 trials: 42% with semaglutide 1.0 mg vs 33% with exenatide ER 2.0 mg in SUSTAIN 3; 43% with semaglutide 0.5 mg vs 33% with dulaglutide 0.75 mg and 44% with semaglutide 1.0 mg vs 48% with dulaglutide 1.5 mg in SUSTAIN 7; 44% with semaglutide 1.0 mg vs 38% with liraglutide 1.2 mg in SUSTAIN 10. The five most commonly reported GI AEs in SUSTAIN 3, 7 and 10 were: nausea (23% with semaglutide 0.5 mg, 21%–22% with semaglutide 1.0 mg and 12%–20% with comparators); vomiting (10% with semaglutide 0.5 mg, 7%–10% with semaglutide 1.0 mg and 4%–10% with comparators); diarrhea (14% with semaglutide 0.5 mg, 11%–16% with semaglutide 1.0 mg and 8%–18% with comparators); dyspepsia (3% with semaglutide 0.5 mg, 4%–7% with semaglutide 1.0 mg and 3%–5% with comparators) and constipation (5% with semaglutide 0.5 mg, 5%–6% with semaglutide 1.0 mg and 3%–5% with comparators).

2.3 Statistical considerations

On‐treatment GI AE incidence was evaluated in post‐hoc analyses performed using pooled STEP 1‐3 data for semaglutide 2.4 mg and placebo arms. STEP 4 was not included in the pooled analysis because of the differences in study design. For AE analyses, participants were considered to be on treatment if any dose of trial product was administered within the previous 49 days. The percentage of participants that experienced GI AEs and the event rate per 100 patient‐years of exposure were adjusted using Cochran‐Mantel‐Haenszel weights to account for differences between trials. Median durations of GI AEs were estimated using the Kaplan‐Meier estimator.

The effect of GI AEs on weight loss was explored using two different post‐hoc analyses:
A descriptive analysis of percentage change in body weight from baseline to week 68 among participants who did or did not experience GI AEs during STEP 1‐3, using observed body weight data from participants who were on treatment and had a body weight assessment at week 68 (on treatment was defined as any dose of trial product within the previous 2 weeks). Analyses were performed separately among participants with/without (i) any GI AEs and (ii) a subset of common GI AEs that were probably considered to influence weight loss (nausea, diarrhoea and vomiting).
Mediation analysis used a natural effects model with imputation‐based estimation, as described previously. This analysis aimed to separate the overall effects on body weight into effects mediated by GI AEs (indirect effects) and those unrelated to GI AEs (direct effects), for the STEP 1‐3 trials. Changes in body weight were analysed addressing the effect of treatment (if taken as intended) using a mixed model for repeated measurements.

GI AE incidence in the STEP 4 trial was analysed with a methodology similar to that used for the STEP 1‐3 pooled analysis, with the exception that no adjustment of AE incidence or event rate was performed. Data from participants able to tolerate the semaglutide 2.4 mg dose during the 20‐week run‐in period who were subsequently randomized were used to evaluate the effect of continued semaglutide 2.4 mg or cessation of treatment (switch to placebo) on GI AE incidence.

### Gastrointestinal tolerability of once-weekly semaglutide 2.4 mg in adults with overweight or obesity, and the relationship between gastrointestinal adverse events and weight loss [^115M2H2e]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

The GI AE profile of semaglutide 2.4 mg in the STEP trials is consistent with previous observations with lower semaglutide doses and the established AE profile of GLP‐1RAs. Direct comparison of GI AE incidence with semaglutide 1.0 and 2.4 mg in adults with T2D and overweight or obesity in STEP 2 found only a slightly higher incidence of GI AEs with semaglutide 2.4 mg (63.5% of participants) versus 1.0 mg (57.5%), despite the more than doubling of dose, and few patients discontinued treatment because of GI AEs in either group (4.2% of participants vs. 3.5%, respectively). These findings are consistent with the established dose dependence of GI AEs with the GLP‐1RA class and semaglutide specifically. As higher incidences of GI AEs tend to be experienced with higher doses of GLP‐1RAs, gradual dose escalation and dose adjustment may help mitigate the impact of GI AEs in clinical practice.

Almost all approved obesity pharmacotherapies are commonly associated with GI AEs, including orlistat (e.g. faecal urgency), phentermine‐topiramate (e.g. constipation) and naltrexone‐bupropion (e.g. nausea and constipation). Use of liraglutide 3.0 mg, another GLP‐1RA, approved for treatment of overweight or obesity, can also result in mild‐or‐moderate GI AEs of a nature similar to those reported in the STEP trials, primarily during initial dose escalation.,

The mechanism of action through which GI AEs arise with GLP‐1RAs remains uncertain. Delayed gastric emptying may be a potential contributor, particularly with short‐acting GLP‐1RAs; longer‐acting agents do not appear to be associated with notable delays in gastric emptying. A 12‐week study of semaglutide 1.0 mg in adults with obesity using the paracetamol absorption test identified a delay in first‐hour gastric emptying after a meal versus placebo; however, a 20‐week study of semaglutide 2.4 mg did not identify such a delay in paracetamol‐assessed gastric emptying. Changes in the rate of lower GI transit may be responsible for constipation and/or diarrhoea, although evidence is lacking. The mechanism for GLP‐1RA‐induced nausea may primarily relate to central effects; studies in animal models suggest that nausea responses associated with peripheral GLP‐1RA administration involve activation of GLP‐1 receptors in the central nervous system.

GLP-1 RA Treatment in Subjects Scheduled for Upper Gastrointestinal Endoscopy or General Anesthesia. Recommendations for Clinical Practice

There has been no consensus on the optimal management of individuals on GLP-1RA therapy undergoing either endoscopy or general anesthesia. The American Society of Anesthesiologists has suggested withholding short-acting GLP-1RAs for 1 day and long-acting GLP-1RAs for 1 week prior to the procedure. However, this may not be sufficient to reduce the risk of retained gastric contents and/or aspiration events, as the dose-response relationship suggests that even physiological concentrations of intact GLP-1 are sufficient to slow gastric emptying. For example, steady-state plasma semaglutide concentrations with 1 mg per week injected subcutaneously have been reported to be approximately 40 nmol/L. Assuming that 99% is albumin-bound, only 1% (400 pmol/L) is free to diffuse into tissues and bind to GLP-1 receptors, but these concentrations are > 40-fold higher than physiological intact GLP-1 concentrations. With an elimination half-life of 7.6 days, pausing semaglutide injections for 1 week is expected to reduce plasma concentrations to approximately half this value, still > 20-fold higher than physiological concentrations, which is sufficient to decelerate gastric emptying, as indicated by studies employing the GLP-1 receptor antagonist exendin. To avoid retained gastric content, much longer withholding of semaglutide and other long-acting GLP-1RAs most likely would be needed, which would be impractical and may cause impaired perioperative glycemic control. In line with these considerations, the American Gastroenterology Association did not find adequate evidence to support the cessation of GLP-1RA therapy in all patients and suggests that each patient requires an individual assessment to determine whether GLP-1RA therapy should be withheld. There was also the suggestion that in lieu of stopping GLP-1RAs, patients could be placed on a liquid diet 1 day prior to their procedure. An alternative suggestion was that for patients with symptoms suggesting retained gastric contents, for whom delaying endoscopy may have negative clinical consequences, rapid-sequence intubation should be considered. It is, however, unclear whether patients at risk can be identified through symptoms, as discussed earlier.

### Gradual titration of semaglutide results in better treatment adherence and fewer adverse events: a randomized controlled open-label pilot study examining a 16-week flexible titration regimen versus label-recommended 8-week semaglutide titration regimen [^115p9Ldh]. Diabetes Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To determine whether a slower, flexible titration regimen of semaglutide would improve adherence and reduce gastrointestinal adverse events (GI-AEs) compared with the label-recommended regimen in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D).

Research Design and Methods

A total of 104 patients with T2D were randomized to label-recommended titration (0.25 mg, 0.5 mg, 1 mg at 4-week intervals) or flexible titration (starting at 0.0675 mg [measured as five clicks made by the dose selector dial], with gradual increases by 0.0675 mg/week and delays for GI-AEs) for 26 weeks.

Results

While final doses were similar between groups, only 2% of patients in the flexible arm withdrew due to GI-AEs vs. 19% in the label arm (P = 0.005). The flexible arm reported less nausea (45.1% vs. 64.2%; P = 0.051) and asthenia (9.8% vs. 24.5%; P = 0.047), with fewer days experiencing nausea (2.88 vs. 6.3 days; P = 0.017). HbA1c and BMI changes were similar between groups.

Conclusions

Slower, flexible titration improved adherence and reduced adverse events without compromising efficacy.

### 2020 expert consensus decision pathway on novel therapies for cardiovascular risk reduction in patients with type 2 diabetes: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^113nUjKU]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2020). High credibility.

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) initiation — monitoring and coadministration guidance is emphasized as follows: Patients initiating a GLP-1RA should be informed that transient nausea is a relatively common side effect, and nausea and vomiting can be minimized by starting with the lowest dose, up-titrating gradually according to the label recommendations, ceasing up titration when the nausea becomes uncomfortable, and eating smaller portions; a low-fat diet can also help. This nausea does not imply gastrointestinal pathology and is usually self-limited in patients treated with longer-acting GLP-1RAs. GLP-1RAs should be used with caution in patients who have had problems with clinically significant gastroparesis, and if treatment is suspended, reinitiation should again be at the lowest dose, with gradual up-titration to avoid recurrent nausea and vomiting. GLP-1RA should not be coadministered with DPP4 inhibitors given that both work through GLP-1 signaling and have not been studied for use together. An increased risk of diabetic retinopathy complications has been noted with semaglutide, predominantly in patients with a prior history of proliferative retinopathy; therefore, these patients should have regular eye examinations, as recommended by the current guidelines.

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS

Oral Medications: OZEMPIC delays gastric emptying. May impact absorption of concomitantly administered oral medications. Use with caution (7.2).

7.1 Concomitant Use with an Insulin Secretagogue (e.g. Sulfonylurea) or with Insulin

OZEMPIC stimulates insulin release in the presence of elevated blood glucose concentrations. Patients receiving OZEMPIC in combination with an insulin secretagogue (e.g., sulfonylurea) or insulin may have an increased risk of hypoglycemia, including severe hypoglycemia.

When initiating OZEMPIC, consider reducing the dose of concomitantly administered insulin secretagogue (such as sulfonylureas) or insulin to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5), Adverse Reactions (6)].

7.2 Oral Medications

OZEMPIC causes a delay of gastric emptying, and thereby has the potential to impact the absorption of concomitantly administered oral medications. In clinical pharmacology trials, semaglutide did not affect the absorption of orally administered medications to any clinically relevant degree [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Nonetheless, caution should be exercised when oral medications are concomitantly administered with OZEMPIC.

### Effects of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists on endoscopy outcomes: systematic review and meta-analysis [^112Wk8Kq]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) are known to cause delayed gastric emptying; however, the effect on clinical outcomes during upper endoscopy and colonoscopy remains unclear. We conducted a meta-analysis to reconcile the data.

Methods

Online databases were searched for studies evaluating GLP-1RAs versus a control group (no GLP-1RAs) in patients undergoing endoscopy. The outcomes of interest were rate of retained gastric contents (RGCs), aborted procedures, aspiration events, and subjective bowel preparation quality. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using a random-effects model.

Results

Twenty-three studies with 77,152 patients (4449 in the GLP-1RA arm and 72,703 in the control arm) were included. Mean patient age ranged from 47.6 to 72 years, and 58.4% were women. As compared with the control group, the GLP-1RA group had higher odds of RGCs (OR, 15.39; 95% CI, 4.65–50.99; P < .01) and aborted procedures (OR, 13.86; 95% CI, 4.42–43.43; P < .01). No significant differences were observed between the 2 groups in terms of aspiration events (OR, 21.06; 95% CI, .13–3379.01; p = 0.24) and subjective bowel preparation quality (OR, .94; 95% CI, .67–1.31; p = 0.83).

Conclusions

Although statistical significance was reached in terms of visible RGCs and early termination of endoscopies in patients on GLP-1RAs, these events were overall rare. GLP-1RAs do not appear to pose significant risk, as the odds of developing aspiration were comparable in the 2 groups.

Side effects

Side effects are relatively common but usually not severe. These are more likely to occur within the first weeks of initiation of therapy and with dose escalation. Side effects tend to decrease in frequency and severity with continuation of a stable dose. GI side effects are most frequent and include nausea (25%–44%), diarrhea (19%–30%), vomiting (8%–24%), constipation (17%–24%), and abdominal pain (9%–20%). Although certain side effects have been reported more commonly with semaglutide than with tirzepatide, trial data suggest that such differences may be a reflection of variation in background (i.e. placebo group) rates in the enrolled trial populations, with the proportional increase in many side effects when compared to placebo being similar for the 2 agents (Table 2). Emerging therapies, such as dual and triple receptor agonists targeting GLP‐1, glucose‐dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), and glucagon pathways, aim to improve efficacy while reducing GI side effects. Real‐world experience has largely mirrored these trial data, with GI issues (nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, constipation) being the most frequently reported side effects.

TABLE 2
Common side effects reported in semaglutide and tirzepatide trials for obesity a.

In the trials, GI symptoms rarely led to discontinuation, with < 10% of participants stopping therapy due to GI issues. Fewer data are available on the impact of GI side effects on adherence in clinical practice. Combining GLP‐1s with metformin does not appear to worsen GI side effects, despite metformin's association with similar symptoms.

Underlying causes of these GI symptoms appear varied. GLP‐1s delay gastric emptying, leading to bloating, fullness, and nausea. GLP‐1s activate several brain regions responsible for weight regulation, appetite, and nausea. Occasionally, GLP‐1s affect intestinal motility or secretions, contributing to diarrhea. Higher doses are more likely to provoke these adverse symptoms, indicating a dose‐dependent relationship.

Materials and methods

SUSTAIN 3, 7 and 10 trial designs

The designs of the SUSTAIN 3, 7 and 10 trials have been previously published. Briefly, subjects with inadequately controlled T2D were randomized to receive: (1) in SUSTAIN 3, semaglutide 1.0 mg or exenatide ER 2.0 mg, in addition to existing oral antidiabetes drugs, over 56 weeks;(2) in SUSTAIN 7, semaglutide 0.5 mg or 1.0 mg, or dulaglutide 0.75 mg or 1.5 mg in addition to metformin monotherapy, over 40 weeks;(3) in SUSTAIN 10, semaglutide 1.0 mg or liraglutide 1.2 mg, in addition to 1–3 oral antidiabetes drugs, over 30 weeks.

Semaglutide-treated subjects followed a fixed dose-escalation regimen:the 0.5 mg maintenance dose was reached after 4 weeks of 0.25 mg OW and the 1.0 mg maintenance dose was reached after 4 weeks of 0.25 mg OW, followed by 4 weeks of 0.5 mg OW. Exenatide ER was administered in accordance with its prescribing information(ie, no dose escalation) and dulaglutide was administered in accordance with its phase III clinical trial program (ie, no dose escalation). The liraglutide 1.2 mg maintenance dose was reached after 1 week of 0.6 mg once daily.

For all three trials, prior to trial initiation, the protocol, the consent form and the subject information sheet were reviewed and approved according to local regulations by appropriate health authorities and by an independent ethics committee/institutional review board. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants.

Post hoc analyses

Subjects in the SUSTAIN 3, 7 and 10 trials were subdivided according to whether or not they had reported either nausea or vomiting or both nausea and vomiting (nausea/vomiting), regardless of severity or duration. In addition, the subjects were subdivided according to whether or not they had reported any of the five most common GI AEs associated with semaglutide (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation or dyspepsia).

### Semaglutide in the spotlight: weighing benefits against rising concerns [^116rs2mE]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Dear editor,

The recent surge in popularity of the antidiabetic drug, Semaglutide, marketed under the names Wegovy (which has the highest concentration of the active drug), Rybelsus, and Ozempic, for its notable efficacy in weight loss has raised pertinent considerations. Semaglutide is a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) that is administered once weekly. It is effective in reducing hemoglobin A1C levels and promoting weight loss in patients with type 2 diabetes.

Further studies demonstrated significant weight loss and improvements in cardiometabolic risk factors with evidence showing good toleration, although gastrointestinal adverse effects were common.

While it is commendable to find a drug that offers promising results beyond its primary intended purpose, the skyrocketing demand in developed nations necessitates vigilance.

First and foremost, there is potential for off-label abuse. With societal pressure to attain perceived ideal body weights, it is conceivable that individuals may seek this medication outside of its primary indication, potentially exposing themselves to unforeseen risks. Long-term side effects, especially when taken by non-diabetics, are not yet well documented and require continued monitoring.

Furthermore, the surge in demand can invariably drive up costs. This inflation could inadvertently limit access for diabetic patients who genuinely require Semaglutide for glycemic control. Price escalation also means increased out-of-pocket expenses, further burdening the healthcare systems of many developed countries and by extension, stifling the likelihood of patronage and usage in low- and middle-income countries.

It is imperative that endocrinologists and by extension other medical professionals, policymakers, strategic stakeholders, and regulatory bodies remain vigilant. Best still, it is most convenient to note that Semaglutide is a prescription medication and should be used under the guidance of a physician. It is not intended for recreational or non-medical use. Ongoing research, public awareness campaigns about potential risks, a vetting system for usage, and a structured pricing mechanism are vital to ensuring that Semaglutide remains both accessible and safe.

### Effect of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists on bowel preparation for colonoscopy [^113gykoJ]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Inadequate bowel preparation can result in decreased diagnostic accuracy and therapeutic safety of colonoscopy for colon cancer screening. The Boston Bowel Preparation Scale (BBPS) has been used to assess the quality of bowel preparation. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA) are commonly used medications for diabetes mellitus and obesity that are known to delay gastrointestinal motility. We hypothesized that the use of GLP-1RA would be associated with decreased quality of bowel preparation.

Methods

We performed a retrospective cohort study of patients who underwent screening or surveillance colonoscopy at a large academic medical center between December 2021 and December 2022. We included patients taking any GLP-1RA for diabetes or obesity during colonoscopy defined as our cases, and patients who were prescribed GLP-1RA at one point but not within 3 months of colonoscopy defined as our controls. We excluded patients on any promotility or antimotility agents and those without BBPS recorded on their procedure report. Independent t test assessed statistical differences in the case and control groups to compare the quality of bowel preparation for continuous variables, and the χ 2 test was used for categorical variables. Multivariate linear regression including diabetes as a covariate was also performed for continuous variables, and multivariate logistic regression was performed for categorical variables.

Results

A total of 446 patients were included in the study, comprising 265 (59%) cases and 181 controls (41%). There were no statistically significant differences between groups at baseline except for the diagnosis of diabetes (P = 0.001) with a higher proportion of patients with diabetes in the cases. The mean BBPS was significantly higher in controls (7.0 ± 1.9 vs 7.5 ± 2.4, P = 0.046) when controlling for diabetes. The percentage of patients with a total BBPS score of < 5 was significantly higher in cases (15.5% vs 6.6%, P = 0.01). The proportion of patients who required a repeat colonoscopy due to poor bowel preparation was also significantly higher in cases (18.9% vs 11.1%, P = 0.041).

Discussion

The use of GLP-1RA was associated with a statistically significantly lower quality of bowel preparation, with additional clinical significance given a notable difference in the need for a repeat colonoscopy. It will be essential to understand the cumulative effect of medications that may delay gastric emptying on the quality of bowel preparation to better understand the appropriate measures and counseling that need to be taken before undergoing outpatient colonoscopies.

### Oral semaglutide for type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113YrKhj]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Aim

To assess the efficacy and safety of oral semaglutide, a novel glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist, for patients with type 2 diabetes.

Methods

We searched Medline, Embase, the Cochrane Library and grey literature sources up to July 1, 2019 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing oral semaglutide with placebo or other antidiabetic agents. The primary outcome was change from baseline in HbA1c. Secondary outcomes included change from baseline in body weight and blood pressure, cardiovascular endpoints, severe hypoglycaemia, gastrointestinal adverse events and diabetic retinopathy. We synthesized results using weighted mean differences (WMDs) for continuous outcomes and odds ratios (ORs) for dichotomous outcomes, along with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

Results

We included 11 RCTs with 9890 patients in the systematic review. Compared with placebo, oral semaglutide reduced HbA1c and body weight (WMD -0.89%, 95% CI -1.07 to -0.71 and-2.99kg, 95% CI -3.69 to -2.30, respectively). Oral semaglutide was also superior to other active comparators (including liraglutide, empagliflozin and sitaglipitin) in terms of lowering HbA1c (WMD -0.35%, 95% CI -0.43 to -0.26) and reduction of body weight (WMD -1.48kg, 95% CI -2.28 to -0.67), and had a favourable effect on systolic blood pressure. Compared with placebo, oral semaglutide reduced all-cause mortality (OR 0.58, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.92) and cardiovascular mortality (OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.98), and had a neutral effect on myocardial infarction, stroke, severe hypoglycaemia and diabetic retinopathy. However, treatment with oral semaglutide increased the incidence of nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, while events of acute pancreatitis were rare.

Conclusions

Oral semaglutide can effectively and safely reduce blood glucose, body weight and systolic blood pressure. Nevertheless, it is associated with increased incidence of gastrointestinal adverse events. Further research is needed to clarify its long-term safety and comparative effectiveness against other antidiabetic agents.

Effects were estimated using a natural effects model (interaction between treatment and any GI AEs together with the baseline variables of body weight and stratification factors [STEP 2 only] as main effects, assuming no interaction between natural effects and baseline variables) with imputation‐based estimation. CIs are 95% Wald CIs. GI AEs comprise any type of GI disorder, including on‐treatment AEs (participants were considered to be on treatment if any dose of trial product was administered within the previous 49 days)

### Gastrointestinal tolerability of once-weekly semaglutide 2.4 mg in adults with overweight or obesity, and the relationship between gastrointestinal adverse events and weight loss [^115BAWEV]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

STEP 4 provides additional insight and reassurance on the GI tolerability profile of semaglutide 2.4 mg. Participants able to tolerate semaglutide 2.4 mg utilizing the standard escalation regimen during the 20‐week run‐in were typically able to tolerate continued treatment for the remainder of the trial, with only two discontinuations because of GI AEs after week 20. Furthermore, for those who had ongoing GI side effects, the prevalence of nausea, diarrhoea and constipation decreased gradually over time.

GI disorders are well‐known side effects of GLP‐1RAs, leading clinicians to query whether weight losses are a result of these side effects. Across STEP 1‐3, we observed that reductions in body weight from baseline to week 68 with semaglutide 2.4 mg were nearly as great in participants without versus with GI AEs: in the descriptive analysis, weight loss with semaglutide 2.4 mg ranged from 9.6% to 17.1% in participants without GI AEs and from 11.4% to 17.7% in those with GI AEs. Consistent with these observations, the mediation analysis (which formally estimates the contribution of GI AEs to weight loss) found that GI AEs appeared to contribute little to the weight‐loss benefit of semaglutide: of the additional 7.6%‐14.4% weight loss provided by semaglutide 2.4 mg over placebo in STEP 1‐3, < 1 percentage point was estimated to be mediated by GI AEs (for GI disorders overall and specifically for the occurrence of nausea, diarrhoea and/or vomiting). Thus, the mediation analysis found that weight loss with semaglutide 2.4 mg was mostly attributable to treatment effects unrelated to GI AEs. These results are consistent with previous analyses of the weight‐loss effects of GLP‐1RAs in people with obesity and/or T2D, which typically showed a small contribution of GI AEs to GLP‐1RA‐induced weight loss. The ability of semaglutide to lower body weight appears to relate to increased satiety, appetite regulation, improved hedonic and homeostatic control of eating and reduced energy intake, mediated by direct and indirect central nervous system effects, particularly on the hypothalamus and hindbrain.

### Comparative efficacy and tolerability of currently approved incretin mimetics: a systematic analysis of placebo-controlled clinical trials [^112s3SRJ]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Aims

This study compares the therapeutic efficacy, gastrointestinal (GI) adverse event (AE) rates and the relationship between the therapeutic efficacy and GI AEs in randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials (RCTs) of GLP-1 RAs and the dual GLP-1/GIP agonist tirzepatide.

Materials and Methods

A systematic PubMed search identified 38 phase 3 or 4 placebo-controlled RCTs of exenatide (b.i.d. and q.w.), lixisenatide, liraglutide, dulaglutide, albiglutide, semaglutide (s.c. and oral) and tirzepatide with a total of 16660 individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D) across 104 study arms. Changes in HbA1c, fasting plasma glucose and body weight and the proportion of GI AEs (nausea, vomiting or diarrhoea) were calculated by agent, preparation and dose. The correlation between odds ratios (ORs) for GI AEs and the magnitude of therapeutic efficacy was assessed in a linear regression analysis.

Results

Baseline characteristics were similar across studies: mean age 57 ± 10years, diabetes duration 8 ± 6years, body mass index (BMI) 31.9 ± 5.8kg/m 2 and HbA1c 8.2% ± 0.9%. HbA1c reductions ranged from -0.63% ± 0.03% (lixisenatide, 20μg q.d.) to -1.79% ± 0.09% (tirzepatide, 15mg q.w.; p < 0.0001). Weight reductions ranged from -0.75 ± 0.10kg to -9.65 ± 0.56kg. Despite the high variability in therapeutic efficacy, ORs for GI AEs were similar across compounds/preparations.

Conclusions

The magnitude of efficacy for intended therapeutic actions (HbA1c and body weight reduction) varied widely between incretin mimetic glucose-lowering agents. However, larger therapeutic efficacy was not systematically associated with higher GI AE or drug discontinuation rates, indicating better tolerability of the more effective agents/preparations.

### Gastrointestinal tolerability of once-weekly semaglutide 2.4 mg in adults with overweight or obesity, and the relationship between gastrointestinal adverse events and weight loss [^1168vF5k]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Aim

We evaluated gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events (AEs) with once-weekly semaglutide 2.4mg in adults with overweight or obesity and their contribution to weight loss (WL).

Materials and Methods

AE analyses pooled data from the Semaglutide Treatment Effect in People With Obesity (STEP) 1–3 trials for participants randomized to 68weeks of semaglutide 2.4 mg (n = 2117) or placebo (n = 1262). WL was analysed by presence/absence of GI AEs. Mediation analysis estimated WL effects mediated by and unrelated to GI AEs. GI tolerability with semaglutide 2.4 mg maintenance and cessation after dose escalation was evaluated using STEP 4 data among 803 participants tolerating 20weeks of semaglutide run-in.

Results

GI AEs were more common with semaglutide 2.4 mg than placebo, with most frequently nausea (43.9% vs. 16.1% of participants), diarrhoea (29.7% vs. 15.9%), vomiting (24.5% vs. 6.3%) and constipation (24.2% vs. 11.1%). Most GI AEs with semaglutide were non-serious (99.5% of AEs), mild-to-moderate (98.1%), transient and occurred most frequently during/shortly after dose escalation. Few semaglutide-treated participants (4.3%) permanently discontinued treatment for GI AEs. In STEP 1–3, mean WL with semaglutide 2.4 mg was similar in participants without (9.6%-17.1%) versus with GI AEs (11.4%-17.7%). Consistent with this observation, mediation analysis found that GI AEs contributed little to semaglutide-induced WL: of the additional 7.6%-14.4% WL with semaglutide versus placebo, < 1 percentage point was mediated by GI AEs. In STEP 4, semaglutide 2.4 mg maintenance was well tolerated.

Conclusions

GI AEs were more common with semaglutide 2.4 mg than placebo, but typically mild-to-moderate and transient. Semaglutide-induced WL was largely independent of GI AEs.

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

Adverse Reactions in Clinical Trials in Adults with Obesity or Overweight for Weight Reduction

WEGOVY 2.4 mg Subcutaneous Weekly Dosage

WEGOVY was evaluated for safety in 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials that included 2,116 adult patients with obesity or overweight treated with 2.4 mg WEGOVY for up to 68 weeks and a 7-week off-drug follow-up period [see Clinical Studies (14.2)]. Baseline characteristics included a mean age of 48 years, 71% female, 72% White, 14% Asian, 9% Black or African American, and 5% reported as other or unknown; and 85% were not Hispanic or Latino ethnicity, 13% were Hispanic or Latino ethnicity, and 2% reported as unknown. The baseline characteristics were 42% with hypertension, 19% with type 2 diabetes, 43% with dyslipidemia, 28% with a BMI greater than 40 kg/m2, and 4% with CV disease.

In these clinical trials, 6.8% of patients treated with 2.4 mg WEGOVY and 3.2% of patients treated with placebo permanently discontinued treatment as a result of adverse reactions. The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation were nausea (1.8% versus 0.2%), vomiting (1.2% versus 0%), and diarrhea (0.7% versus 0.1%) for WEGOVY and placebo, respectively.

### Effect of oral semaglutide on cardiovascular parameters and their mechanisms in patients with type 2 diabetes: rationale and design of the semaglutide anti-atherosclerotic mechanisms of action study (SAMAS) [^111Yi84Z]. Diabetes Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Intervention

Patients will be assigned to two groups, with one receiving the active agent and the other receiving placebo. The active substance will be the oral GLP-1 receptor agonist semaglutide (Rybelsus 3 mg, 7 mg, 14 mg tablets; Novo Nordisk A/S Bagsvaerd, Denmark). The drug will have to be taken on an empty stomach in the morning after at least an 8 h fasting period. After the oral semaglutide tablet is ingested, the subjects will have to wait at least 30 min before eating, drinking or taking other oral medications. The oral semaglutide tablet must be taken with no more than a half glass of water (equivalent to 120 ml), must be swallowed whole and can not be split, crushed or chewed. The starting dose of oral semaglutide will be 3 mg; after 30 days, a dose escalation to 7 mg is anticipated; and after another 30 days, dose escalation to 14 mg, i.e. the maintenance dose, is expected. A dose escalation regimen is needed to avoid the development of the potential side effects (listed in Table 2). Dose escalation will be encouraged by notifying the patient by phone, with the call made 1 day prior to the day on which the new dose starts. If treatment with oral semaglutide is associated with unacceptable gastrointestinal side effects (moderate to severe), dose reduction or extension of dose escalation intervals will be allowed as judged by the unblinded nurse involved in the randomization process.

Table 2
Potential adverse effects of the oral semaglutide

The placebo and semaglutide tablets will be provided in identical cases, will be identically shaped and will be packed in identically shaped bottles that will be labelled with numbers. The patients will be advised to contact the study team in case of any problems or adverse events during the study.

Treatment Allocation

After the screening, the participants will be randomized to one of the two study groups in 1:1 ratio. A non-blinded study nurse (otherwise not associated with the trial) will allocate study participants into the groups evenly. Patients will be given a sufficient number of tablets (placebo or semaglutide) in bottles labelled by numbers, for the first 6 months of therapy. An additional drug package will be provided to each patient at the 6-month interval.

### Impact of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists on bowel preparation for colonoscopy: a large, matched regional cohort [^116fmRZC]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Poor colon preparation may negatively affect colonoscopy accuracy, result in cancelation, or need for repeat procedure. The glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) class of medications delay gastric emptying, although the clinical impact of this on the quality of colon preparation is not known.

Methods

This was a retrospective matched cohort study in a multi-center, outpatient setting. Colonoscopy reports for patients prescribed GLP-1RA at the time of procedure were compared to a cohort matched for diabetes and cirrhosis who were not prescribed GLP-1RA at the time of procedure. The primary endpoint was a composite of indicators for inadequate bowel preparation.

Objective

The current study's objective is to analyze the effects of GLP-1RA medications on the quality of colonoscopy preparation.

Results

There were 503 patients in each cohort and baseline characteristics were similar. Use of GLP-1RA at the time of colonoscopy was associated with a greater odds of the composite outcome (125 vs 56, odds ratio [OR] = 2.6; 95% CI, 1.9–3.7). There were also increased odds for individual outcome components including proceduralist documenting inadequate, suboptimal, or poor bowel preparation, narrative comments related to inadequate bowel preparation, and recommendation for extended bowel preparation with future colonoscopy. Repeat procedure was also more common in the GLP-1RA cohort (26 vs 9, OR = 3.0; 95% CI, 1.4–6.5).

Conclusion and Relevance

This study assessed the impact of the GLP-1RA class of medication on the quality of bowel preparation for lower endoscopies. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist use increased the odds of inadequate bowel preparation and repeat procedure.

### Anti-obesity medication protocols toolkit [^111bGd9e]. PES (2023). High credibility.

Semaglutide (Ozempic® and Wegovy®) dose escalation — it is recommended to slowly increase the dose of semaglutide until you reach your goal dose. For Ozempic®, give 0.25 mg semaglutide once each week for 4 weeks, then give 0.5 mg semaglutide once each week for 6 weeks, then give 1 mg semaglutide once each week; this is the final dose and continue until you see the doctor next. For Wegovy®, give 0.25 mg semaglutide once each week for 4 weeks, give 0.5 mg semaglutide once each week for 4 weeks, give 1 mg semaglutide once each week for 4 weeks, give 1.7 mg semaglutide once each week for 4 weeks, then give 2.4 mg semaglutide once each week; this is the final dose and continue until you see the doctor next.

### Anti-obesity medications and investigational agents: an Obesity Medicine Association (OMA) clinical practice statement (CPS) 2022 [^115W4B2V]. Obesity Pillars (2022). High credibility.

Table 2 — Semaglutide (glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist) at 2.4 mg subcutaneously per week is approved for treatment of obesity, with average weight reduction about 15%, and at oral doses of 7–14 mg per day is indicated to lower blood sugar in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. It is contraindicated in patients with personal or family history of medullary thyroid carcinoma or in patients with Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia syndrome type 2 or known hypersensitivity to semaglutide. It is associated with hypoglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes treated with concomitant hypoglycemic medications such as insulin or sulfonylureas and may slow gastric emptying, which may impact absorption of concomitantly administered oral medication.

5.3 Diabetic Retinopathy Complications

In a pooled analysis of glycemic control trials with RYBELSUS, patients reported diabetic retinopathy related adverse reactions during the trial (4.2% with RYBELSUS and 3.8% with comparator) [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

In a 2-year cardiovascular outcomes trial with semaglutide injection involving patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and high cardiovascular risk, diabetic retinopathy complications (which was a 4-component adjudicated endpoint) occurred in patients treated with semaglutide injection (3%) compared to placebo (1.8%). The absolute risk increase for diabetic retinopathy complications was larger among patients with a history of diabetic retinopathy at baseline (semaglutide injection 8.2%, placebo 5.2%) than among patients without a known history of diabetic retinopathy (semaglutide injection 0.7%, placebo 0.4%).

Rapid improvement in glucose control has been associated with a temporary worsening of diabetic retinopathy. The effect of long-term glycemic control with semaglutide on diabetic retinopathy complications has not been studied. Patients with a history of diabetic retinopathy should be monitored for progression of diabetic retinopathy.

5.4 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use of Insulin Secretagogues or Insulin

Patients receiving RYBELSUS in combination with an insulin secretagogue (e.g., sulfonylurea) or insulin may have an increased risk of hypoglycemia, including severe hypoglycemia [see Adverse Reactions (6.1), Drug Interactions (7)].

The risk of hypoglycemia may be lowered by a reduction in the dosage of sulfonylurea (or other concomitantly administered insulin secretagogue) or insulin. Inform patients using these concomitant medications of the risk of hypoglycemia and educate them on the signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia.

5.5 Acute Kidney Injury

There have been postmarketing reports of acute kidney injury and worsening of chronic renal failure, which may sometimes require hemodialysis, in patients treated with GLP-1 receptor agonists, including semaglutide. Some of these events have been reported in patients without known underlying renal disease. A majority of the reported events occurred in patients who had experienced nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or dehydration.

Monitor renal function when initiating or escalating doses of RYBELSUS in patients reporting severe adverse gastrointestinal reactions.
