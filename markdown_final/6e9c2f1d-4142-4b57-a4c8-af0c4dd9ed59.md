## Question

Best pain medication for dental abscess

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the best pain medication for a dental abscess. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the fact that definitive treatment is source control and that analgesics are adjunctive. Then, I should verify which analgesics are recommended first-line and whether combinations outperform opioids. Next, I will review safety considerations and contraindications. After that, I should confirm when, if ever, opioids are appropriate and how to minimize risk. Finally, I will consider any useful adjuncts and outline a practical, evidence-based plan the patient could follow while arranging urgent dental care [^112pu1hm] [^114nqXGY].

> Let me first confirm the clinical priority: a dental abscess is an infection requiring definitive dental management such as incision and drainage, root canal therapy, or extraction; pain medicines do not treat the source and antibiotics are not routinely indicated unless there is spreading infection or systemic illness, so analgesics here are supportive while urgent dental care is arranged [^114nqXGY] [^114XPJps].

> Now, I need to verify the best analgesic class for abscess pain. The most recent ADA-endorsed guidance for acute dental pain recommends NSAIDs, alone or combined with acetaminophen, as first-line because they provide superior analgesia and a better safety profile than opioids when not contraindicated; I should not jump to opioids before trying these options [^112pu1hm]. Hold on, let me double-check the trial data: randomized studies of ibuprofen plus acetaminophen after oral surgery show the combination is effective and well tolerated, which supports this nonopioid-first approach for dental pain with an inflammatory component [^114x5znC] [^1151Vu7m]. This makes physiologic sense because NSAIDs target prostaglandin-mediated inflammation prominent in odontogenic infection pain, and emergency pain guidance similarly prioritizes NSAIDs for inflammatory acute pain states [^115GJbYa].

> Next, I should translate that into a pragmatic regimen. When NSAIDs are not contraindicated, ibuprofen dosed on a scheduled basis and combined with acetaminophen usually gives the best relief; many clinicians pair an NSAID dose with acetaminophen dose-for-dose during the first 24–48 hours for synergy, then taper as pain improves, while adhering to labeled maximum daily doses and accounting for any acetaminophen from combination products; I need to ensure the patient stays within safe acetaminophen totals and appropriate NSAID intervals based on product labeling [^112pu1hm] [^112T7Z8w]. Wait, I should confirm the ceiling doses: FDA labeling for acetaminophen IV shows maxima between 3,750 and 4,000 mg/day in adults depending on the formulation, underscoring why I must carefully total all acetaminophen sources, and IV ibuprofen labeling highlights typical adult maintenance intervals that mirror oral practice, reinforcing scheduled — not "as-needed only" — use during early management [^112Fjz3e] [^114HUL5k] [^11193QAC] [^112T7Z8w].

> I need to check contraindications and precautions before recommending NSAIDs. Hold on, I should verify gastrointestinal and renal risk: NSAID labels warn about GI bleeding, ulceration, and perforation and advise using the lowest effective dose for the shortest time; caution is warranted in patients with peptic ulcer disease, chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular risk, and in late pregnancy, so in those scenarios acetaminophen alone may be preferred initially with careful dosing and consultation [^1131S36Q] [^115GJbYa] [^112T7Z8w].

> Now, I should confirm where opioids fit. Opioids are not first-line for dental abscess pain; they are reserved for cases where NSAIDs are contraindicated or inadequate despite optimized NSAID plus acetaminophen therapy, and even then should be used at the lowest effective dose for the shortest possible duration due to risks of adverse outcomes and persistent use after dental prescribing; I should double-check that this is consistent with both ADA guidance and outcomes data, which it is [^112pu1hm] [^112sAksf]. If an opioid is deemed necessary, FDA labeling reinforces individualized, minimal dosing and short courses, which helps mitigate respiratory depression and misuse risks; coordination with the patient's prescribers is important if they are already on opioids for chronic pain [^116P4zse] [^114H6wAg] [^117M7892].

> Let me consider potential adjuncts while definitive care is arranged. Local anesthetic techniques, including regional blocks, can be valuable for short-term analgesia in urgent and ED settings according to the same guideline; there is also a small ED trial suggesting a single oral dexamethasone dose may reduce pain at 12 hours in periapical abscess, though benefits were not durable beyond that window, so if used, it should be as a one-time adjunct with attention to infection control and patient-specific risks, not a substitute for NSAIDs and definitive drainage [^112pu1hm] [^112Sm585].

> I should also confirm red flags and the role of antibiotics, because that affects pain management urgency. Fever, malaise, trismus, diffuse swelling or cellulitis, immunocompromise, or concern for deep space infection warrant prompt antibiotics and urgent dental or maxillofacial evaluation in addition to analgesia; otherwise, antibiotics do not improve pain or outcomes without operative source control, and delayed drainage can worsen both pain and infection risk [^114nqXGY] [^1148ZAjq].

> Putting this together, the best pain medication strategy for a dental abscess is an NSAID, preferably scheduled ibuprofen, often combined with acetaminophen for superior analgesia, provided there are no contraindications; opioids should be avoided or strictly limited to rare rescue situations after optimizing nonopioids, while urgent dental drainage remains the definitive treatment to actually resolve the source of pain [^112pu1hm] [^114x5znC] [^114nqXGY].

---

Ibuprofen 400–600 mg every 6 hours is the **best first-line pain medication** for dental abscesses due to its anti-inflammatory effect and superior analgesia over opioids [^112pu1hm] [^115GJbYa]. If pain control is inadequate, **add acetaminophen 500–1000 mg every 6 hours** (not exceeding 3,000 mg/day) for synergistic relief [^114x5znC] [^112pu1hm] [^1151Vu7m]. Opioids should be reserved for severe pain unresponsive to NSAIDs/acetaminophen [^112pu1hm], used at the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration [^116P4zse], and avoided in patients with substance use disorder or respiratory risk [^112sAksf]. Always combine analgesia with definitive dental treatment (incision and drainage or root canal) [^114nqXGY] and use antibiotics only when there are systemic or spreading signs of infection [^113DW4FB].

---

## First-line analgesic therapy

### Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)

NSAIDs are the **preferred first-line analgesics** for dental abscess pain due to their anti-inflammatory properties [^112pu1hm] and superior analgesic efficacy compared to opioids [^115GJbYa]. Ibuprofen is the **most commonly recommended NSAID** for dental pain management.

- **Ibuprofen dosage**: 400–600 mg orally every 6 hours as needed, not exceeding 2,400 mg per day [^112pu1hm].

- **Mechanism of action**: Inhibits cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, reducing prostaglandin synthesis and inflammation.

- **Clinical evidence**: NSAIDs alone or in combination with acetaminophen [^1151Vu7m] provide superior pain relief compared to opioids, with a more favorable safety profile [^112pu1hm].

---

### Acetaminophen (paracetamol)

Acetaminophen is an **effective analgesic** that can be used alone or in combination with NSAIDs for enhanced pain control [^113kVSuA].

- **Acetaminophen dosage**: 500–1,000 mg orally every 6 hours as needed, not exceeding 3,000 mg per day [^112pu1hm].

- **Mechanism of action**: Inhibits prostaglandin synthesis in the central nervous system, providing analgesic and antipyretic effects.

- **Clinical evidence**: Combination therapy with NSAIDs and acetaminophen provides superior analgesia compared to either medication alone [^114x5znC] [^112pu1hm].

---

## Adjunctive analgesic therapy

### Corticosteroids

Corticosteroids, such as dexamethasone, **may be considered as adjunctive therapy** for severe inflammation or swelling associated with dental abscesses. A **single dose of dexamethasone 4–8 mg**, given orally or intravenously, significantly reduces pain at 12 hours, although the effect diminishes by 24 hours [^112Sm585].

---

## Opioid analgesics

Opioids should be reserved for **severe pain** unresponsive to NSAIDs and acetaminophen, as they carry significant risks, including addiction, respiratory depression [^116P4zse], and persistent opioid use [^112sAksf]. Commonly prescribed opioids include **hydrocodone-acetaminophen (Norco)**, **oxycodone-acetaminophen (Percocet)**, and **codeine-acetaminophen (Tylenol #3)**. The **clinical evidence** indicates that opioids are less effective than NSAIDs for dental pain and should be used cautiously, only when alternative treatments are inadequate [^112pu1hm].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Clinical guidelines consistently recommend **NSAIDs as first-line therapy** for dental abscess pain, with acetaminophen as an adjunctive option [^112pu1hm]. Opioids are reserved for severe pain unresponsive to first-line treatments [^115GJbYa].

| **Analgesic** | **Dosage** | **Indication** | **Clinical evidence** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Ibuprofen | 400–600 mg every 6 hours | First-line | - Superior analgesia [^112pu1hm] <br/> - Anti-inflammatory [^115GJbYa] |
| Acetaminophen | 500–1,000 mg every 6 hours | Adjunctive | - Effective analgesia [^112pu1hm] <br/> - Synergistic with NSAIDs [^114x5znC] |
| Dexamethasone | 4–8 mg single dose | Adjunctive | - Reduces inflammation <br/> - Short-term pain relief [^112Sm585] |
| Opioids | As prescribed | Severe pain | - Reserved for refractory cases [^112pu1hm] <br/> - Significant risks [^116P4zse] |

---

## Patient-specific considerations

When selecting analgesic therapy, **clinicians must consider patient-specific factors**, including [^113EbsEA]:

- **Allergies**: NSAID or acetaminophen allergies.

- **Comorbidities**: Gastrointestinal, renal, hepatic, cardiovascular conditions [^115GJbYa].

- **Medication interactions**: Potential drug interactions.

- **Substance use history**: Risk of opioid misuse or addiction [^112sAksf].

---

## Definitive dental treatment

Analgesic therapy provides **temporary relief** and must be combined with definitive dental treatment, such as incision and drainage or root canal therapy, to address the underlying infection [^114nqXGY].

---

## Antibiotic therapy

Antibiotics are indicated **only when** there is evidence of spreading infection, systemic involvement, or immunocompromised status [^114nqXGY]. Commonly prescribed antibiotics include amoxicillin, clindamycin, and metronidazole [^1153cJx1].

---

## Conclusion

Ibuprofen is the **best first-line pain medication** for dental abscesses, with acetaminophen as an adjunctive option. Opioids should be reserved for severe pain unresponsive to first-line treatments. Analgesic therapy must be combined with definitive dental treatment and antibiotics when indicated.

### Systemic antibiotics for symptomatic apical periodontitis and acute apical abscess in adults [^114nqXGY]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). High credibility.

Dental pain can significantly impact the quality of life. Symptomatic apical periodontitis and acute apical abscess are common causes of dental pain and are often caused by an inflamed or necrotic dental pulp, or infection of the pulpless root canal system. Clinical guidelines recommend that the primary treatment for these conditions should involve the removal of the source of inflammation or infection through local operative measures. Systemic antibiotics are currently recommended only when there is evidence of spreading infection (such as cellulitis, lymph node involvement, diffuse swelling) or systemic involvement (fever, malaise). Despite this, evidence suggests that dentists frequently prescribe antibiotics even in the absence of these signs, raising concerns about the potential contribution to antibiotic-resistant bacteria. This review is the second update of the original version first published in 2014.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the effects of systemic antibiotics, provided with or without surgical intervention (such as extraction, incision and drainage of a swelling, or endodontic treatment), and with or without analgesics, for symptomatic apical periodontitis and acute apical abscess in adults.

- **Search methods**: We searched Cochrane Oral Health's Trials Register (26 February 2018 (discontinued)), CENTRAL (2022, Issue 10), MEDLINE Ovid (23 November 2022), Embase Ovid (23 November 2022), CINAHL EBSCO (25 November 2022) and two trials registries, and performed a grey literature search.

### Serious opioid-related adverse outcomes associated with opioids prescribed by dentists [^112sAksf]. Pain (2022). Low credibility.

Although nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are superior to opioids in dental pain management, opioids are still prescribed for dental pain in the United States. Little is known about the serious adverse outcomes of short-acting opioids within the context of dental prescribing. The objective of this study was to evaluate adverse outcomes and persistent opioid use (POU) after opioid prescriptions by dentists, based on whether opioids were overprescribed or within recommendations. A cross-sectional analysis of adults with a dental visit and corresponding opioid prescription (index) from 2011 to 2018 within a nationwide commercial claims database was conducted.

Opioid overprescribing was defined as > 120 morphine milligram equivalents per Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines. Generalized estimating equation models were used to assess adverse outcomes (emergency department visits, hospitalizations, newly diagnosed substance use disorder, naloxone administration, or death within 30 days from index) and POU (≥ 1 prescription 4–90 days postindex).

Predicted probabilities are reported. Of 633,387 visits, 2.6% experienced an adverse outcome and 16.6% had POU. Adverse outcome risk was not different whether opioids were overprescribed or within recommendations (predicted probability 9.0%, confidence interval [CI]: 8.0%-10.2% vs 9.1%, CI: 8.1%-10.3), but POU was higher when opioids were overprescribed (predicted probability 27.4%, CI: 26.1%-28.8% vs 25.2%, CI: 24.0%-26.5%). Visits associated with mild pain and those with substance use disorders had the highest risk.

### Evidence-based clinical practice guidelines for the management of acute dental pain [^112pu1hm]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). High credibility.

In the United States, on average, someone visits a hospital emergency department (ED) for a dental condition every 15 seconds. This commentary summarizes the recommendations from a 2024 clinical practice guideline for the pharmacological management of acute dental pain associated with tooth extractions and toothache. The guidelines apply to ED settings, hospitals, and urgent care clinics where definitive dental treatment is not immediately available.

A guideline panel convened by the American Dental Association, the ADA Science & Research Institute, the University of Pittsburgh School of Dental Medicine, and Penn Dental Medicine examined the effect of opioid and non-opioid analgesics, local anesthetics (including blocks), corticosteroids, and topical anesthetics on acute dental pain. The GRADE approach was used to assess the certainty of the evidence, and the GRADE Evidence-to-Decision Framework was utilized to formulate 18 recommendations and six good practice statements.

A beneficial net balance favors the use of non-opioid medications compared with opioid medications. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), alone or in combination with acetaminophen, likely provide superior pain relief with a more favorable safety profile compared with opioids when not contraindicated.

NSAIDs with or without acetaminophen are recommended as first-line therapy for managing acute dental pain following tooth extraction(s) and temporarily managing toothache. Opioids should be reserved for clinical situations when first-line therapy is insufficient or when contraindications to NSAIDs exist.

### Antibiotic use for irreversible pulpitis [^117Dz72q]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Low credibility.

Irreversible pulpitis, characterized by acute and intense pain, is one of the most frequent reasons patients seek emergency dental care. Apart from tooth removal, the customary method of relieving the pain of irreversible pulpitis is by drilling into the tooth, removing the inflamed pulp (nerve), and cleaning the root canal. However, a significant number of dentists continue to prescribe antibiotics to stop the pain of irreversible pulpitis. This review updates the previous version published in 2016.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of systemic antibiotics for irreversible pulpitis.

- **Search methods**: We searched Cochrane Oral Health's Trials Register (to 18 February 2019); the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2019, Issue 1) in the Cochrane Library (searched 18 February 2019); MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 18 February 2019); Embase Ovid (1980 to 18 February 2019); US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register ClinicalTrials.gov (searched 18 February 2019); and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (searched 18 February 2019). There were no language restrictions in the searches of the electronic databases.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials which compared pain relief with systemic antibiotics and analgesics, against placebo and analgesics in the acute preoperative phase of irreversible pulpitis.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Three review authors screened studies and extracted data independently. We assessed the certainty of the evidence of included studies using GRADE criteria.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^113KrirW]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for skin abscess, specifically in terms of antibiotic therapy, the IDSA 2014 guidelines recommend administering an antibiotic active against MRSA in patients with carbuncles or abscesses that do not respond to initial antibiotic treatment. This recommendation also applies to patients with markedly impaired host defenses or systemic inflammatory response syndrome associated with hypotension.

### Butrans [^111ZiP7N]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Butrans is indicated for the management of severe and persistent pain that requires an extended treatment period with a daily opioid analgesic and for which alternative treatment options are inadequate.

- **Limitations of use**: Because of the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse with opioids, which can occur at any dosage or duration, and because of the greater risks of overdose and death with extended-release/long-acting opioid formulations [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)], reserve Butrans for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options (e.g. non-opioid analgesics or immediate-release opioids) are ineffective, not tolerated, or would otherwise be inadequate to provide sufficient management of pain. Butrans is not indicated as an as-needed (prn) analgesic.

### Combined acetaminophen and ibuprofen for pain relief after oral surgery in adults: A randomized controlled trial [^114x5znC]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2010). High credibility.

After the initial screening, 189 patients were approached, and 135 agreed to participate. One to four teeth were extracted with local anesthetic alone in 69 patients and with local anesthetic in combination with general anesthesia in 66. Thirteen patients did not return their patient diaries, so 122 patients were included in the evaluable intent-to-treat (ITT) population for the analysis of the primary endpoints. The treatment groups were adequately matched in baseline patient and clinical characteristics.

Of those in the combination group, 60.0% had three or four teeth extracted compared with 43.6% for the ibuprofen group and 53.5% for the acetaminophen group.

- **Flow of participants through trial**: Not randomized (n = 54): (i) declined to participate (n = 15), (ii) did not meet inclusion criteria (n = 14), (iii) other reasons (n = 25). Other reasons included the surgery being canceled or rescheduled, the patient could not be contacted, or the patient was given the wrong date of the surgery.

### Efficacy and safety of single-dose DFN-15 for treatment of acute postsurgical dental pain: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study [^113x4VM6]. Pain (2022). High credibility.

The percentage of participants who reached meaningful pain relief (PR) was the highest (87.1%) in the 250-mg DFN-15 dose group, compared with 33.3% in the placebo group. The median times to meaningful PR for the 125-mg (59 minutes) and 250-mg (42 minutes) DFN-15 dose groups were statistically significantly shorter than placebo (P < 0.0001). The median time for placebo could not be estimated as two-thirds of the observations were censored; the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval for the median time was 231.6 minutes. Similar to confirmed perceptible PR, the median time to meaningful PR for the 62.5-mg DFN-15 dose group (114 minutes) was not significantly different from placebo (P = 0.0895). The Kaplan–Meier curve for time to meaningful PR is shown in Figure 3.

- **Figure 3**: Kaplan–Meier curve for time to meaningful pain relief (modified intent-to-treat (mITT) population). Subjects receiving rescue medication or discontinuing the study before reporting meaningful pain relief were censored at 8 hours.

A large majority of participants (77% to 93%) reported satisfaction with their treatment in the DFN-15 dose groups compared with 23% in the placebo group. The mean (SD) satisfaction scores were 2.1 (1.06), 2.9 (1.07), and 3.2 (0.96) in the 62.5, 125, and 250-mg DFN-15 dose groups, respectively, compared with 0.8 (1.10) in the placebo group. The differences compared with placebo were statistically significant at all DFN-15 doses (P < 0.0001 for all comparisons).

### A qualitative exploration of dentists' opioid prescribing decisions within U.S. Veterans Affairs facilities [^114rmngU]. Pain (2023). High credibility.

Pharmacologic management of acute dental pain includes the use of opioid and nonopioid analgesics. Safe and effective use of these medications requires consideration of specific patient and clinical factors combined with clinical judgment. Despite recommendations and evidence supporting the efficacy of nonopioids such as acetaminophen (APAP) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen to manage acute pain, these options have been "historically underappreciated by many dentists", thereby contributing to opioid overprescribing by dentists practicing in the United States.

The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) provides the greatest volume of dental care in the US, caring for approximately one-half million veterans in 2020. Managing acute dental pain among the veteran population can be uniquely challenging for several reasons. Up to 50% of veterans experience chronic pain, a portion of which involves management with opioids. Many veterans also have histories of substance use disorders and other mental health challenges, which may affect safe options for managing acute dental pain.

In addition to federal and state efforts, the VA implemented system-wide efforts to decrease opioid prescribing. In 2012, almost 25% of veterans had filled a prescription for an opioid in a VA outpatient pharmacy. By 2016, this number decreased by approximately a quarter. However, similar to the national landscape, assessing the implementation of VA opioid mitigation efforts focused largely on measuring changes in opioid prescribing rates.

### Do oral and maxillofacial surgeons over-prescribe opioids after extraction of asymptomatic third molars [^112HYH74]? Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2019). Low credibility.

The opioid abuse crisis is a significant public health concern. While oral opioids are commonly prescribed following the removal of third molars, the precise amount required for adequate postoperative analgesia remains uncertain. This study aimed to quantify the opioid requirements after third molar extractions.

This prospective cohort study involved consecutive patients who underwent extraction of asymptomatic third molars with intravenous sedation at the Boston Children's Hospital (Boston, MA) from June through October 2018, performed by three attending surgeons. To be included, patients must have had all four third molars removed. Exclusion criteria included concomitant procedures, preoperative infections, postoperative inflammatory complications, chronic pain conditions, or failure to complete the study. Postoperative prescriptions and instructions included:

- **Oxycodone 5-mg tablets**: 1 tablet every 6 hours as needed (dispensed, 6).
- **Ibuprofen 600-mg tablets**: 1 tablet every 6 hours as needed (dispensed, 20).
- **Acetaminophen 325-mg tablets**: 2 tablets every 6 hours as needed (dispensed, 40).

Participants reported their medication use via electronic questionnaire each day for seven postoperative days (PODs), and descriptive statistics were calculated.

Eighty-one patients (56% female; mean age, 19.4 ± 7.7 years) were included. The average number of oxycodone tablets used was 0.04 ± 0.24, with the highest daily use occurring on POD 2 (1.0 ± 0.0 tablet). Oxycodone was taken by 3 patients (4%) on POD 1, 4 patients (5%) on POD 2, and 2 patients (3%) on PODs 3 and 4; no use was reported from POD 5 to 7. Seventy-five patients (93%) utilized alternative analgesic regimens.

### Development of evidence-based recommendations for procedure-specific pain management: Prospect methodology [^115RvHQQ]. Anaesthesia (2019). Low credibility.

Summary information from the included studies is extracted and tabulated using a predefined data extraction form. The extracted information includes study design (including interventions), population characteristics, outcomes assessed, and critical evaluation. The information regarding study design includes author name, year of publication, overall sample size, analgesic interventions evaluated, sample size in each group, treatment in the comparator group (placebo or active), population (age, sex, opioid tolerance, or psychiatric comorbidities), details about the surgical procedure and anesthetic technique, and the duration of follow-up.

Outcome data are extracted, including pain scores at rest or during activity, time-to-first request for rescue analgesia, cumulative 24-hour opioid requirements, non-opioid analgesic use, opioid-related adverse events such as postoperative nausea and vomiting, analgesic intervention-related adverse events, and any other additional outcomes assessed. Critical evaluation includes relevance to clinical practice and use of paracetamol and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or COX-2 specific inhibitors (termed as 'basic analgesic regimen') in the study groups.

Postoperative pain intensity scores at rest and/or pain intensity during activity (when available) are designated as primary outcome measures. A change of more than 10 mm in pain scores is considered clinically relevant. Secondary outcomes include time to first request for rescue analgesia.

### The use of antibiotics in odontogenic infections: What is the best choice? A systematic review [^1153cJx1]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Odontogenic infections are a common problem in dentistry, and their treatment often requires the use of antibiotics in addition to the removal of the source of infection. This can make it difficult for clinicians to decide on the appropriate antibiotic choice. This study aimed to answer the following questions using the Patient, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome (PICO) format: When should antibiotics be used in dental infections (DIs)? Which are the most effective drugs? How long should antibiotics be administered?

- **Materials and methods**: This was a systematic review using the PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane databases without restriction on the time period researched. The variables analyzed in each article included the number of odontogenic infections in each study, type of study, surgical intervention performed, antibiotics administered, statistical differences between groups studied, and patients' evolution after treatment.

- **Results**: The search included 1,109 articles. After fully reading 46 articles, 16 were included in the final review, and 30 were excluded. A sample of 2,197 DI cases was obtained, in which 15 different antibiotics were used, resulting in a 98.2% overall cure rate.

- **Conclusions**: The studies showed that antibiotics were prescribed only in situations of regional and/or systemic body manifestations. In the case of DIs, once drainage has been performed and/or the cause of infection has been removed, all antibiotics tested are equally effective regarding clinical cure. The choice of antibiotics is not as crucial as the local intervention.

### VA/DoD clinical practice guideline for the use of opioids in the management of chronic pain [^114B4Mee]. VA/DoD (2022). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for opioids for pain, particularly with respect to patients with opioid use disorder, the DoD/VA 2022 guidelines state that there is insufficient evidence to recommend any one medication over another. Specifically, no preference is given between methadone, buprenorphine, or extended-release naltrexone injection for chronic pain management in patients receiving medication for opioid use disorder.

### Clinical indications associated with opioid initiation for pain management in Ontario, Canada: a population-based cohort study [^113qNnYj]. Pain (2018). Low credibility.

We used a stepwise hierarchical approach to identify the most likely clinical indication for opioid initiation among individuals in the cohort. The hierarchy was developed based on the licensing college of the initial prescriber and the degree of certainty that the procedural and diagnostic information on the related health care administrative data would warrant an opioid prescription. For example, we were most certain of indications for dental pain because the index prescription was directly linked to a dentist. For all other prescriptions written by physicians, our hierarchy was informed by clinical insight as to the likelihood that the diagnosis or procedure would lead to an opioid initiation.

In the first step of the hierarchical approach, we classified individuals whose index opioid was prescribed by a dentist, then those with evidence of palliative care in the past year, followed by those with evidence of active cancer in the past year, into each of these three indications accordingly. For those remaining, we identified the diagnostic and procedural information on their most recent health care interaction on or in the five days preceding the first-opioid prescription. Health care interactions included inpatient hospitalizations, emergency department visits, outpatient surgical procedures, and physician office visits.

In the second hierarchical step, we classified individuals with a recent hospitalization or procedure into procedure-based indications according to the Canadian Classification of Health Interventions (CCI).

### Efficacy and safety of single-dose DFN-15 for treatment of acute postsurgical dental pain: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study [^112XkoLY]. Pain (2022). High credibility.

The PID scores were statistically significantly lower in all DFN-15 dose groups compared with placebo at all post-dose time points between 30 minutes and 5 hours, with P ≤ 0.0419, P < 0.0001, and P < 0.0001 for the 62.5-, 125-, and 250-mg DFN-15 dose groups, respectively. The statistical significance versus placebo extended to 15 minutes and 6 hours post-dose time points for the 125-mg dose group and to 6 hours post-dose for the 250-mg dose group. The PID value for the combined DFN-15 group was also statistically significant compared with the placebo group between 15 minutes and 6 hours post-dose (P ≤ 0.0288).

The mean (SD) peak PR score was 2.6 (0.83), 3.2 (0.79), and 3.3 (0.69) for the 62.5, 125, and 250-mg DFN-15 dose groups, respectively, compared with 2.4 (1.11) for the placebo group. More important, the median times (95% CI) to peak PR score were 76 (60, 120), 61 (60, 120), and 90 (60, 120) minutes for the 62.5, 125, and 250-mg DFN-15 dose groups. These data compared favorably against the placebo group, for which the median time to peak PR could not be estimated because half of the observations were censored due to participants not reporting a positive PR score (the lower bound of the 95% CI was 180 minutes) (P < 0.001 for all comparisons, log-rank test).

### Systemic antibiotics for symptomatic apical periodontitis and acute apical abscess in adults [^113DW4FB]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Dental pain can have a considerable detrimental effect on an individual's quality of life. Symptomatic apical periodontitis and acute apical abscess are common causes of dental pain, arising from an inflamed or necrotic dental pulp or infection of the pulpless root canal system. Clinical guidelines recommend that the first-line treatment for teeth with symptomatic apical periodontitis or an acute apical abscess should involve the removal of the source of inflammation or infection through local, operative measures. Systemic antibiotics are currently recommended only for situations where there is evidence of spreading infection, such as cellulitis, lymph node involvement, diffuse swelling, or systemic involvement like fever and malaise. Despite this, there is evidence that dentists continue to prescribe antibiotics for these conditions, raising concerns about the development of antibiotic-resistant bacterial colonies both within individuals and the community.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the effects of systemic antibiotics provided with or without surgical intervention (such as extraction, incision and drainage of a swelling, or endodontic treatment), with or without analgesics, for symptomatic apical periodontitis or acute apical abscess in adults.

- **Search methods**: We searched the following electronic databases: Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register (to 1 October 2013); Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library 2013, Issue 9); MEDLINE via OVID (1946 to 1 October 2013); EMBASE via OVID (1980 to 1 October 2013).

### The effects of dexamethasone on the time to pain resolution in dental periapical abscess [^112Sm585]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Dental infections are frequently encountered in the emergency department (ED), with periapical abscesses being among the most painful. Traditional pain management strategies include local anesthetic injections, oral analgesics, and intravenous opioids.

- **Objectives**: We sought to identify an alternative pain management strategy with the early use of dexamethasone as an adjunct to conventional therapies for inflammation and pain at the site of infection.

- **Methods**: We conducted a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study comparing the analgesic effect of dexamethasone and placebo in ED patients with periapical abscess during a 2-year timeframe at two urban academic EDs. Adult patients presenting with physical examination findings consistent with a diagnosis of periapical abscess were randomized to receive oral dexamethasone or an identical placebo. Pain was assessed using the verbal numeric scale in person at discharge and via telephone at 12, 24, 48, and 72 hours after discharge from the ED.

- **Results**: Seventy-three patients were enrolled, with 37 receiving dexamethasone and 36 receiving placebo. Follow-up pain scores were obtained for 52 patients at 12, 24, 48, and 72 hours. Ten patients from the dexamethasone group and 11 from the placebo group were lost to follow-up. Patients who received dexamethasone reported a greater reduction in pain at 12 hours compared with the placebo group (p = 0.029). Changes in pain scores from baseline and at 24, 48, and 72 hours were not statistically significant. No adverse events were reported.

- **Conclusions**: Single-dose dexamethasone asan adjunct therapy may offer an effective alternative for pain reduction in patients with dental periapical abscesses, although further research is warranted to explore long-term outcomes.

### Development of evidence-based recommendations for procedure-specific pain management: Prospect methodology [^112h2Nra]. Anaesthesia (2019). High credibility.

The PROSPECT subgroup determines whether each intervention should be recommended or not recommended. To be recommended, the intervention must be shown to be beneficial in at least two RCTs. Studies are not excluded from the review based on the risk of bias scoring. Additionally, to ensure clinical relevance, the relevance to peri-operative practice is assessed. We also assess if the intervention would improve postoperative pain relief and/or outcomes when added to the "basic analgesic regimen", or would be beneficial if this regimen is not possible or is contraindicated. Furthermore, the balance between the invasiveness of the analgesic technique and the consequences of postoperative pain, as well as the balance between the analgesic efficacy and the adverse event profile of the analgesic technique, is also considered.

Relevant patient characteristics, such as opioid tolerance and psychiatric comorbidities, may be included to ensure both procedure-specific and patient-specific aspects of pain management. Notably, efficacy data from "similar" procedures are not used for recommendations. Adverse effects of analgesic interventions are identified through an extensive literature search, which is not procedure-specific; however, risks are adjusted for the procedure being evaluated. Case-control studies and cohort studies or observational studies can be used to determine adverse effects of analgesic interventions.

Finally, a draft table or algorithm of the recommendations for analgesic, anaesthetic, or surgical interventions is prepared with each recommendation.

### Life threatening abscess in the visceral space with penicillin and metronidazole resistant Prevotella denticola following use of a laryngeal mask airway: case report [^1126yhRA]. BMC Anesthesiology (2021). Low credibility.

Treatment was initiated with analgesics at the day care center. The general practitioner added amoxicillin 24 hours later, following national guidelines for the treatment of laryngitis. Unfortunately, the Prevotella spp., which caused the infection, was resistant to amoxicillin, allowing the infection to spread further, causing pain, dysphagia, and respiratory problems. Fortunately, the patient recovered well on therapy with amoxicillin/clavulanate and vancomycin. Respiratory distress improved over the following 24 hours, and the swelling diminished. Subsequently, the abscess was incised 5 days later under general anesthesia. The treatment involving antibiotics and surgical intervention for deep neck abscesses was in line with international guidelines.

Prevotella is a genus of Gram-negative bacteria. They are non-motile, singular cells that thrive in anaerobic growth conditions and are found on tissues with decreased oxidation-reduction potentials, such as those with limited blood supply or tissue necrosis. Prevotella spp. are found in the oral cavity, gastrointestinal tract, and vagina. They can act as opportunistic pathogens, often penetrating tissues and establishing infections at mucosal surfaces, causing periodontal and tooth problems such as gingivitis and periodontitis. They predominate in periodontal disease and periodontal abscesses. Some Prevotella spp. are resistant to Beta-lactam antibiotics. Effective antibiotic treatments include metronidazole, amoxicillin/clavulanate, ureidopenicillins, carbapenems, cephalosporins, clindamycin, and chloramphenicol.

### Clinical practice recommendations for the diagnosis and management of X-linked hypophosphataemia [^1159NmEu]. Nature Reviews. Nephrology (2019). Low credibility.

Conventional treatment improves dentin mineralization, reduces the number of dental abscesses, and decreases the frequency and severity of periodontitis. Reducing the size of the pulp chambers, as demonstrated by dental radiographs, is a useful sign of successful treatment. Continued supplementation through adulthood may be beneficial, as the number of dental abscesses and severity of periodontitis vary according to the percentage of adult life with treatment.

To prevent bacterial invasion of the dentin and pulp via enamel microcracks, sealing the occlusal surfaces of both deciduous and permanent teeth is suggested in children with XLH. This approach can be achieved with flowable resin composite placed in the pits and fissures of the occlusal surface and should be performed regularly as soon as the eruption of the tooth allows acceptable isolation of the occlusal surface.

Acute abscesses might require antibiotic treatment depending on the extent and severity of the infection. For deciduous teeth, the decision to extract or treat endodontically will depend on the extent of the infection, recurrence, and the expected timing of normal exfoliation of the permanent tooth. For permanent teeth, endodontic treatment or re-treatment of the tooth are the preferred options, although healing after endodontic treatment might not be as favorable as in healthy patients.

Prevention, treatment, and supportive care of periodontitis in adult patients should follow standard management, as in the general population. Treatment of periodontitis should aim to decrease gingival inflammation and periodontal pocket depth, preventing further progressive attachment loss.

### A red plaque on the face of a healthy man [^112gjeSf]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Low credibility.

- **Which of the following is true regarding the prognosis of this condition?**
	- A. The prognosis is good, and this condition can be managed with oral antibiotics in the outpatient setting
	- B. The 5-year relative survival rate for a specific stage of this condition is 80%
	- C. This condition is considered a benign disease but may recur after treatment in more than 40% of cases
	- D. Although commonly misdiagnosed, this condition has an excellent prognosis once proper endodontic therapy is performed
	- E. There is an overall poor prognosis of this condition, with the 5-year survival between 10% and 50%

- **Answers**:

	- A. The prognosis is good, and this condition can be managed with oral antibiotics in the outpatient setting – Incorrect. This refers to the prognosis of erysipelas, which is usually managed in the outpatient setting with oral antibiotics. Importantly, hospitalization for intravenous antibiotics may be considered in severe cases affecting those who are immunocompromised, infants, and the elderly.

	- B. The 5-year relative survival rate for a specific stage of this condition is 80% – Incorrect. There are 4 widely recognized types of KS; however, they differ in epidemiology and prognosis. The 5-year relative survival rate for KS, which compares people with the same type and stage of KS to people in the overall population, is 80%.

	- C. This condition is considered a benign disease but may recur after treatment in more than 40% of cases – Incorrect. The prognosis described here is in reference to angiolymphoid hyperplasia with eosinophilia. Although spontaneous regression may occur.

### Percocet [^116P4zse]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Percocet should be prescribed only by healthcare professionals who are knowledgeable about the use of opioids and how to mitigate the associated risks. Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration of time consistent with individual patient treatment goals [see WARNINGS]. Because the risk of overdose increases as opioid doses increase, reserve titration to higher doses of Percocet for patients in whom lower doses are insufficiently effective and in whom the expected benefits of using a higher dose opioid clearly outweigh the substantial risks.

Many acute pain conditions (e.g. the pain that occurs with a number of surgical procedures or acute musculoskeletal injuries) require no more than a few days of an opioid analgesic. Clinical guidelines on opioid prescribing for some acute pain conditions are available.

There is variability in the opioid analgesic dose and duration needed to adequately manage pain due both to the cause of pain and to individual patient factors. Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient's underlying cause and severity of pain, prior analgesic treatment and response, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse [see WARNINGS].

Respiratory depression can occur at any time during opioid therapy, especially when initiating and following dosage increases with Percocet. Consider this risk when selecting an initial dose and when making dose adjustments [see WARNINGS].

### Development of evidence-based recommendations for procedure-specific pain management: Prospect methodology [^114VfyJA]. Anaesthesia (2019). Low credibility.

A modified Delphi approach is utilized, which includes several rounds of individual comments followed by round-table discussions. Each Working Group member provides comments to the sub-group leader via email. These comments are collated for presentation during the face-to-face meeting when one of the sub-group members presents evidence and the reasons for recommendations. This is followed by a discussion among the members, and a consensus is developed, but any disagreements are recorded as a matter of good practice.

The group also develops clinical questions that need to be answered in the future for each procedure. After the face-to-face meeting, the sub-group prepares a final document, which includes edits based on the discussions during the face-to-face meeting. The final document with the consensus agreements is circulated to the Working Group for review and approval. No major changes are incorporated during this final review stage. Finally, the sub-group prepares a manuscript for publication in a peer-reviewed journal, if appropriate. Subsequently, a web copy is prepared with the help of a medical writer. Of note, the PROSPECT website also includes the overall recommendations in several languages.

### Are invasive procedures effective for chronic pain? A systematic review [^1134wxDi]. Pain Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Chronic pain is a major worldwide problem. In the United States, it is estimated that more than 100 million people suffer from chronic pain, with costs between $560 and $635 billion dollars per year. The estimated prevalence of pain lasting at least three months is 14.6%. The prevalence of chronic musculoskeletal pain conditions and frequent headaches is 43%. Data from the 2012 National Health Interview Study estimated the prevalence of chronic daily pain to be 25.3 million people or 11.2% of the population. These numbers do not describe the full impact that chronic pain has on productivity, quality of life, and human suffering.

To treat pain, the use of opioids has increased dramatically over the last several decades, with 9.6 to 11.5 million adults, or approximately 3%–4% of the adult US population, having been prescribed long-term opioid therapy. Opioids have limited effectiveness for chronic pain and are accompanied by a substantial risk of adverse outcomes, including addiction, overdose, and death. Deaths from opioids now exceed deaths from motor vehicle accidents. Thus, the need for nonpharmacological approaches for treating chronic pain has grown.

### Meperidine hydrochloride [^113pr3jR]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Meperidine hydrochloride tablets should be prescribed only by healthcare professionals who are knowledgeable about the use of opioids and how to mitigate the associated risks. Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals [see Warnings and Precautions (5)]. Because the risk of overdose increases as opioid doses increase, reserve titration to higher doses of meperidine hydrochloride tablets for patients in whom lower doses are insufficiently effective and in whom the expected benefits of using a higher dose opioid clearly outweigh the substantial risks.

Many acute pain conditions, such as pain associated with various surgical procedures or acute musculoskeletal injuries, require no more than a few days of an opioid analgesic. Clinical guidelines on opioid prescribing for some acute pain conditions are available.

There is variability in the opioid analgesic dose and duration needed to adequately manage pain due to both the cause of pain and individual patient factors. Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, considering the patient's underlying cause and severity of pain, prior analgesic treatment and response, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Respiratory depression can occur at any time during opioid therapy, especially when initiating and following dosage increases with meperidine hydrochloride tablets. Consider this risk when selecting an initial dose.

### Duramorph [^111a9wSM]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Duramorph is indicated for managing pain severe enough to require the use of an opioid analgesic via intravenous administration when alternative treatments are not expected to be adequate. It is also indicated for the epidural or intrathecal management of pain without causing any loss of motor, sensory, or sympathetic function.

- **Limitation of use**: Duramorph is not intended for use in continuous microinfusion devices. Due to the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse associated with opioids, which can occur at any dosage or duration, Duramorph should be reserved for patients for whom alternative treatment options (such as non-opioid analgesics or opioid combination products) have not been tolerated or are not expected to be tolerated, and for whom adequate analgesia has not been provided or is not expected to be provided. Duramorph should not be used for extended periods unless the patient's pain remains severe enough to require an opioid analgesic and alternative treatment options continue to be inadequate.

Duramorph is an opioid agonist indicated for:

- **The management of pain**: Severe enough to require an opioid administration when alternative treatments are not expected to be adequate.
- **The epidural or intrathecal management of pain**: Without attendant loss of motor, sensory, or sympathetic function.

- **Limitation of use**: Duramorph is not intended for use in continuous microinfusion devices. Due to the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse associated with opioids, which can occur at any dosage or duration, it should only be reserved for suitable patients following all precautions and guidelines.

### Use of opioids and analgesics among ED patients with dental and low back pain: A national perspective [^117SF1AR]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Emergency department (ED) visits for dental pain and low back pain (LBP) are common. Many such patients have severe pain and receive opioids. Increased opioid-related deaths have led to efforts to reduce opioid prescriptions. We compared recent trends in the use of analgesics and opioids in the ED and at discharge among patients with dental pain or LBP.

- **Methods**: We conducted a secondary analysis of the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS) of patients with dental pain or LBP from 2010 to 2015. We performed univariate and multivariate analyses exploring the association between pain location and the use of analgesics and opioids, controlling for age, gender, and pain severity.

- **Results**: There were an estimated 16 million patient visits for dental pain and 49 million for LBP, respectively. Prescription of opioids at discharge decreased from 59% to 50% (p = 0.02) in dental patients and from 46% to 39% in LBP patients (p = 0.09). Compared to patients with LBP, those with dental pain were less likely to receive analgesics (OR 0.65, 95% CI, 0.57–0.74) or opioids (OR 0.51, 95% CI, 0.44–0.59) while in the ED. In contrast, dental pain patients were more likely to have analgesics (OR 1.32, 95% CI, 1.16–1.51) or opioids (OR 1.65, 95% CI, 1.47–1.85) prescribed at the time of ED discharge than patients with LBP.

- **Conclusions**: Prescription of opioids decreased for ED dental patients. While less likely to receive analgesics and opioids in the ED, patients with dental pain were more likely to be prescribed analgesics and opioids at the time of ED discharge than those with LBP.

### A qualitative exploration of dentists' opioid prescribing decisions within U.S. veterans affairs facilities [^117M7892]. Pain (2023). Low credibility.

- **Capabilities**: Managing acute pain in veterans on opioids for chronic pain. Management of acute dental pain in veterans on long-term opioids for chronic pain routinely involved consultation with a physician. This is reflected in the following response: "Our chronic pain management patients who are already on high levels, and so, I wouldn't prescribe any more. If I were going to, I would have to talk to their chronic pain doctor with them to proceed with caution".

Many dentists explained that they identified veterans on long-term opioid therapy by a written pain agreement or "opioid contract", as dentists referred to them, which was prominent in the medical record. These written agreements were initiated between the patient and the prescribing provider of the long-term opioids, who was most often identified as the patients' primary care physician. Most commonly, if the dentist believed that additional opioids were needed for the acute dental pain, they reportedly contacted the provider designated in the pain agreement. This practice is reflected in the following quote:

"Typically, on our screen, we see opioid contract and we read that and we try to stay within the guidelines of that; if it is a certain amount they cannot exceed, if it is necessary, we call the physician and we talk to them and say, hey I just had to do a surgical extraction, it was really difficult and this guy is going to be in pain for the next 4 to 5 days. What do you think?".

However, several dentists expressed a belief that long-term opioid use offered sufficient pain relief for most of the acute dental situations they encountered.

### Paracetamol for pain relief after surgical removal of lower wisdom teeth [^113kVSuA]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Paracetamol has been commonly used for the relief of postoperative pain following oral surgery. In this review, we investigated the optimal dose of paracetamol and the proper time for drug administration to provide pain relief, considering the side effects of different doses of the drug. This information will inform dentists and their patients of the best strategy for pain relief after the surgical removal of wisdom teeth.

- **Objectives**: To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of paracetamol for pain relief after surgical removal of lower wisdom teeth, compared to placebo, at different doses and administered postoperatively.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register; the Cochrane Pain, Palliative and Supportive Care Group's Trials Register; CENTRAL; MEDLINE; EMBASE and the Controlled Trials Register. Handsearching included several dental journals. We checked the bibliographies of relevant clinical trials and review articles for studies outside the handsearched journals. We wrote to authors of the identified randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and to manufacturers of analgesic pharmaceuticals. We searched personal references in an attempt to identify unpublished or ongoing RCTs. No language restriction was applied. The last electronic search was conducted on 24th August 2006.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised, parallel group, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trials of paracetamol for acute pain following third molar surgery.

- **Data collection and analysis**: All trials identified were scanned independently and in duplicate.

### Approaching acute pain in emergency settings; European Society for Emergency Medicine (EUSEM) guidelines-part 2: management and recommendations [^115GJbYa]. Internal and Emergency Medicine (2020). High credibility.

The EUSEM 2020 guidelines address the management of acute pain, focusing on the use of non-opioid analgesics, particularly NSAIDs. It is recommended to recognize that NSAIDs such as ibuprofen, diclofenac, ketoprofen, and naproxen are commonly used in both pre-hospital and emergency department settings for treating mild to moderate pain, especially when there is an inflammatory component. These medications are most frequently administered orally (PO), intravenously (IV), or topically. NSAIDs remain the preferred analgesic for renal colic, demonstrating equivalence to opioid or opioid-acetaminophen combined analgesia at 30 minutes, and they provide effective analgesia in cases of fracture.

### Pain management after third molar extractions in adolescents: a qualitative study [^1153bBo5]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Low credibility.

The adolescents' pain management behaviors followed the guidance of their dental providers, which allowed for patient input concerning which analgesic medications to use and the duration of use. Adherence to dental treatment recommendations has been shown to be associated with reduced complications in other pediatric and adolescent samples. Parents provided reminders and some support immediately following the procedure, but the adolescent patients were given some autonomy in the process. While participants reported the adolescent receiving some form of opioid medication following surgery and filling the prescription, few reported taking all, and some did not take any, of the opioid medication. Our findings also support those of Maughan and colleagues, who found that over half of the opioids prescribed following a dental procedure went unused. While their study identified that an average of 28 opioid pills were prescribed to adult participants by their dental providers at the time the study was conducted, and that average opioid prescriptions may be lower now given the American Dental Association's 2018 opioid prescribing policy, our sample still noted that they were left with unused opioid medications in their home since the OTC medications and other treatments (e.g. icing the jaw to reduce inflammation) were sufficient for managing post-operative pain. Rather than needing 7 days of opioid pain medications, our sample reported using them no more than 2 or 3 days, at most, when there were no other post-operative complications.

### Hysingla ER [^113fF4yD]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Hysingla ER is indicated for the management of severe and persistent pain that requires an extended treatment period with a daily opioid analgesic and for which alternative treatment options are inadequate. It is an opioid agonist specifically indicated for this purpose.

- **Limitations of use**: Because of the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse with opioids, which can occur at any dosage or duration, and due to the greater risks of overdose and death with extended-release/long-acting opioid formulations, Hysingla ER should be reserved for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options (e.g. non-opioid analgesics or immediate-release opioids) are ineffective, not tolerated, or would be otherwise inadequate to provide sufficient management of pain. Hysingla ER is not indicated as an as-needed (prn) analgesic.

### Antibiotic prescriptions associated with dental-related emergency department visits [^114XPJps]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

The frequency of antibiotic prescribing and types of antibiotics prescribed for dental conditions presenting to the emergency department (ED) is not well known. The objective of this study is to quantify how often and which dental diagnoses made in the ED resulted in an antibiotic prescription.

- **Methods**: From 2011 to 2015, there were an estimated 2.2 million (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.9 to 2.5 million) ED visits per year for dental-related conditions, which accounted for 1.6% (95% CI 1.5% to 1.7%) of ED visits. This is based on an unweighted 2,125 observations from the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey in which a dental-related diagnosis was made.

- **Results**: An antibiotic, most often a narrow-spectrum penicillin or clindamycin, was prescribed in 65% (95% CI 61% to 68%) of ED visits with any dental diagnosis. The most common dental diagnoses for all ages were unspecified disorder of the teeth and supporting structures (44%; 95% CI 41% to 48%; International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification [ICD-9-CM] code 525.9), periapical abscess without sinus (21%; 95% CI 18% to 25%; ICD-9-CM code 522.5), and dental caries (18%; 95% CI 15% to 22%; ICD-9-CM code 521.0). Recommended treatments for these conditions are usually dental procedures rather than antibiotics.

The common use of antibiotics for dental conditions in the ED may indicate the need for greater access to both preventive and urgent care from dentists and other related specialists, as well as the need for clearer clinical guidance and provider education.

### Belbuca [^116xc3x5]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Belbuca is indicated for the management of severe and persistent pain that requires an extended treatment period with a daily opioid analgesic, for which alternative treatment options are inadequate. Belbuca buccal film contains buprenorphine, a partial opioid agonist.

- **Indications and usage**: Belbuca is indicated for the management of severe and persistent pain that requires an extended treatment period with a daily opioid analgesic, for which alternative treatment options are inadequate.

- **Limitations of use**: Because of the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse with opioids, which can occur at any dosage or duration, and because of the greater risks of overdose and death with extended-release/long-acting opioid formulations, it is crucial to reserve Belbuca for patients for whom alternative treatment options (e.g. non-opioid analgesics or immediate-release opioids) are ineffective, not tolerated, or otherwise inadequate to provide sufficient management of pain [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Belbuca is not indicated as an as-needed (prn) analgesic.

### Abscess management: An evidence-based review for emergency medicine clinicians [^1148ZAjq]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Abscesses are commonly evaluated and managed in the emergency department. Recent research has evaluated the use of ultrasonography, packing, incision and drainage (I&D), and antibiotics. There are evidence-based nuances to the management of specific types of abscesses, such as Bartholin, breast, dental, hidradenitis suppurativa, peritonsillar, and pilonidal abscesses.

- **Objective**: This review provides emergency medicine clinicians with a summary of the literature regarding abscess management in the emergency department.

- **Discussion**: Ultrasound is valuable in diagnosing abscesses that are not clinically evident and in guiding I&D procedures. Although I&D is traditionally followed by packing, this practice may be unnecessary for small abscesses. Antibiotics, needle aspiration, and loop drainage are suitable alternatives to I&D of abscesses with certain characteristics. Oral antibiotics can improve outcomes after I&D, although this improvement must be weighed against potential risks. Many strategies are useful in managing Bartholin abscesses, with the Word catheter proving consistently effective. Needle aspiration is the recommended first-line therapy for small breast abscesses. Dental abscesses are often diagnosed with clinical examination alone, but ultrasound may be a useful adjunct. Acute abscess formation caused by hidradenitis suppurativa should be managed surgically by excision when possible because I&D has a high rate of abscess recurrence. Peritonsillar abscesses can be diagnosed with either intraoral or transcervical ultrasound if clinical examination weaknesses exist.

### Immediate and short-term pain relief by acute sciatic nerve press: A randomized controlled trial [^111yDvpN]. BMC Anesthesiology (2007). Low credibility.

All patients in pain from their respective pathologies during a clinic visit to dental and renal clinics were eligible for the trial. Patients who were younger than 15 years old, emotionally unstable, or receiving any analgesic within 12 hours of the test were ineligible for the study. All participants had not been previously exposed to the method, and written informed consent was obtained from each participating patient.

Of the 111 solicited patients, 31 refused to join, 14 were considered ineligible, and 66 patients ranging in age from 16 to 74 years participated in the study. The diseases in enrolled dental patients included dental caries, periodontal diseases, and dental trauma. Renal diseases among recruits included kidney infections, stones, and other conditions.

- **Statistical analysis**: The baseline VAS scores and age of the participants were compared between the "sciatic press" and "placebo press" groups using t-tests. Categorical data were analyzed using chi-square or Fisher Exact tests. Changes from baseline for pain relief were assessed using paired t-tests for both "sciatic press" and "placebo press" groups. Comparisons to the "placebo press" groups were performed using an analysis of covariance procedure, with adjustment for baseline VAS score, sex, and age. All tests were two-sided.

### Clinical indications associated with opioid initiation for pain management in Ontario, Canada: a population-based cohort study [^113NVqgX]. Pain (2018). Low credibility.

Individuals who initiated opioids for dental pain were typically younger (median age 31 years, Q1-Q3 20–52 years), whereas those who initiated for musculoskeletal pain (median age 56 years, Q1-Q3 44–69 years) and cancer and palliative care (median age 66 years, Q1-Q3 55–77 years) were typically older than those in the other indication clusters (range in medians from 45 to 49 years). The neighborhood income quintile profiles of patients were fairly evenly distributed across indication clusters.

- **Clinical indications**: Within each indication cluster, we identified a number of highly prevalent clinical indications. Although specific dental indications could not be identified in our data, the overwhelming majority of patients initiating an opioid for dental pain received their prescription from a dentist (144,118 of 151,874 [94.9%], representing 22.0% of the entire cohort). Other common clinical indications were common excisions (4.2%), joint and muscle pain (7.1%), back pain (4.8%), dislocations, sprains, and strains (4.0%), cancer (5.3%), and abdominal or pelvic pain (6.0%).

### Concordance of antibiotic prescribing with the American Dental Association acute oral infection guidelines within Veterans' Affairs (VA) dentistry [^114LhYdm]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2021). Low credibility.

United States dentists prescribe 10% of all outpatient antibiotics. Assessing the appropriateness of antibiotic prescribing has been challenging due to a lack of guidelines for oral infections. In 2019, the American Dental Association (ADA) published clinical practice guidelines (CPG) on the management of acute oral infections. Our objective was to describe baseline national antibiotic prescribing for acute oral infections prior to the release of the ADA CPG and to identify patient-level variables associated with an antibiotic prescription.

- **Design**: Cross-sectional analysis.

- **Methods**: We performed an analysis of national VA data from January 1, 2017, to December 31, 2017. We identified cases of acute oral infections using International Classification of Disease, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) codes. Antibiotics prescribed by a dentist within ± 7 days of a visit were included. Multivariable logistic regression identified patient-level variables associated with an antibiotic prescription.

- **Results**: Of the 470,039 VA dental visits with oral infections coded, 12% of patient visits with irreversible pulpitis, 17% with apical periodontitis, and 28% with acute apical abscess received antibiotics. Although the median days' supply was 7, prolonged use of antibiotics was frequent (≥ 8 days, 42%-49%). Patients with high-risk cardiac conditions, prosthetic joints, and endodontic, implant, and oral and maxillofacial surgery dental procedures were more likely to receive antibiotics.

### Roxybond [^114H6wAg]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Important dosage and administration instructions**: Roxybond should be prescribed only by healthcare professionals who are knowledgeable about the use of opioids and how to mitigate the associated risks. Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration of time consistent with individual patient treatment goals. Because the risk of overdose increases as opioid doses increase, reserve titration to higher doses of Roxybond for patients in whom lower doses are insufficiently effective and in whom the expected benefits of using a higher dose opioid clearly outweigh the substantial risks [see Warnings and Precautions (5)].

	- Many acute pain conditions, such as those occurring with surgical procedures or acute musculoskeletal injuries, require no more than a few days of an opioid analgesic. Clinical guidelines on opioid prescribing for some acute pain conditions are available. There is variability in the opioid analgesic dose and duration needed to adequately manage pain due both to the cause of pain and to individual patient factors. Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient's underlying cause and severity of pain, prior analgesic treatment and response, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Respiratory depression can occur at any time during opioid therapy, especially when initiating and following dosage increases with Roxybond. Consider this risk when selecting an initial dose and when making dose adjustments [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

### Clinical indications associated with opioid initiation for pain management in Ontario, Canada: a population-based cohort study [^113zPoLT]. Pain (2018). Low credibility.

Use of prescription opioids has increased considerably over the past 2 decades, particularly in Canada and the United States, which had the highest level of opioid consumption per capita worldwide in 2015. High levels of opioid prescribing have raised concerns among clinicians and policymakers, given the limited evidence of the long-term effectiveness of this class of drugs and research finding increased risks of adverse events, including mortality, with long-term use.

Previous research has associated long-term use of prescription opioids and dose escalation with worse outcomes. In turn, recently published clinical practice guidelines for chronic noncancer pain management recommended nonopioid alternatives as first-line and have suggested threshold doses for patients newly started on opioids. However, opioids are prescribed for a range of acute and chronic pain conditions, including arthritis, back pain, postsurgical pain, and dental pain. Studies in select populations have demonstrated that characteristics of opioid initiation and prescribing vary by clinical indication, which may reflect different anticipated needs for different indications as well as variations in training across specialties. Therefore, there has been an emerging recognition that policies and programs developed to address appropriate prescribing of opioids may need to be tailored to each clinical indication. This requires an understanding of the relative contribution of each clinical indication to patterns of opioid initiation. Previous studies investigating these indications have been limited.

### Combined acetaminophen and ibuprofen for pain relief after oral surgery in adults: a randomized controlled trial [^1151Vu7m]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2010). High credibility.

With ethics committee approval, we recruited and followed up patients between March 2005 and February 2008.

- **Setting**: This study was conducted at a publicly funded teaching hospital and a private day-surgical clinic in metropolitan New Zealand.

- **Participants**: We included adults undergoing extraction of at least one lower wisdom tooth with or without one or more upper wisdom teeth by one of three participating surgeons. We excluded patients if they were under 16 years old; weighed less than 50 kg; had taken any NSAID (other than aspirin in a dose of 150 mg daily or less) within 24 hours of the operation; had taken acetaminophen or acetaminophen-containing medicines within 12 hours of the operation; were taking an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, warfarin, steroid (other than interoperative dexamethasone), or any immunosuppressive drug; were intolerant to any NSAID or acetaminophen; were suffering from a severe local infection; had a history of peptic ulceration, asthma, or severe haemopoetic, renal, or hepatic disease; were participating in the investigation of another experimental agent; or if the clinician believed for any other reason that participation in the study might not be in their best interests.

- **Randomization and blinding**: Tablets of identical appearance, packaging, and dosage instructions were provided in each of the following formulations: (i) acetaminophen 500 mg + ibuprofen 150 mg per tablet (Maxigesic ®; Sigma Laboratories, Nashik, India) which was MHRA approved for manufacturing pharmaceuticals.

### Clinical practice recommendations for the diagnosis and management of X-linked hypophosphataemia [^113SoPBM]. Nature Reviews Nephrology (2019). High credibility.

Children and adult patients with XLH might present with spontaneous endodontic infections on apparently intact teeth. Dental abscesses can develop on both deciduous and permanent teeth. The endodontic infection might be asymptomatic for months or years, or it might evolve into dental abscesses, causing pain and swelling. Spread to surrounding anatomical structures causes maxillofacial cellulitis.

Dental complications in patients with XLH are secondary to poorly mineralized dentin. On dental radiographs, the pulp chambers of deciduous or permanent teeth are larger than usual, with long pulp horns extending to the dentino–enamel junction. XLH is not associated with an increased susceptibility to caries.

- **Periodontitis**: The frequency and severity of periodontitis are increased in adult patients with XLH and can lead to tooth loss. Cementum thickness, a central component of the periodontium, is reduced and associated with mineralization defects of the alveolar bone, which impairs the attachment of the ligament fibers. On radiographs from adult patients, the lamina dura might be absent, and the alveolar bone around teeth is frequently reduced.

### Meperidine hydrochloride [^116AXsR7]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Meperidine hydrochloride tablets are indicated for the management of acute pain severe enough to require an opioid analgesic and for which alternative treatments are inadequate.

- **Limitations of use**: Because of the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse with opioids, which can occur at any dosage or duration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)], reserve meperidine hydrochloride tablets for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options (e.g. non-opioid analgesics or opioid combination products) have not been tolerated, or are not expected to be tolerated, or have not provided adequate analgesia, or are not expected to provide adequate analgesia. Meperidine hydrochloride tablets should not be used for an extended period unless the pain remains severe enough to require an opioid analgesic and alternative treatment options continue to be inadequate.

Meperidine hydrochloride tablets should not be used for the treatment of chronic pain. Prolonged use may increase the risk of toxicity, such as seizures, from the accumulation of the meperidine metabolite, normeperidine.

Meperidine is an opioid agonist indicated for the management of pain severe enough to require an opioid analgesic and for which alternative treatments are inadequate.

### Analgesia for non-specific low back pain [^116CPVsy]. BMJ (2024). Low credibility.

Analgesics have limited effect on low back pain, and some, such as opioids and benzodiazepines, carry substantial risks. Oral and, less certainly, topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs offer small benefits that may not outweigh the associated risks, particularly gastrointestinal ones, even for short-term use. Acute low back pain typically improves within a few weeks without treatment. For chronic low back pain, the focus of management should be on non-pharmacological treatments to improve function and address the broader determinants of pain.

Low back pain is the world's leading cause of disability. At any given time, half a billion (9%) adults are affected. Many individuals are prescribed, or independently use, analgesics for pain relief. In this article, we review what is known about common analgesics for treating non-specific low back pain, defined as pain without an identifiable structural or disease cause. We focus on adults aged 18–60 years. A previous BMJ education paper describes the management of low back pain in individuals aged 60 and over, where the likelihood of a specific cause is greater and the risk-benefit balance of analgesics differs. The treatment of radicular low back pain, such as sciatica, has been detailed elsewhere and is not addressed here.

### Ms Contin [^113U4vQz]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

MS CONTIN is indicated for the management of severe and persistent pain that requires an extended treatment period with a daily opioid analgesic and for which alternative treatment options are inadequate. It is an opioid agonist used in conditions where alternative treatments are ineffective or not tolerated.

- **Limitations of use**: Because of the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse with opioids, which can occur at any dosage or duration, and due to the greater risks of overdose and death with extended-release/long-acting opioid formulations, reserve MS CONTIN for patients for whom alternative treatment options (e.g. non-opioid analgesics or immediate-release opioids) are ineffective or would be otherwise inadequate. MS CONTIN is not indicated as an as-needed (prn) analgesic [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

### Efficacy and safety of single-dose DFN-15 for treatment of acute postsurgical dental pain: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study [^1129qnSp]. Pain (2022). High credibility.

Pain intensity was measured using the 11-point Numerical Pain Rating Scale (NPRS), and pain relief (PR) was measured using a 5-point categorical scale (ranging from 0 = no PR to 4 = complete PR) at 15, 30, and 45 minutes, and 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 hours after T0. To assess their overall level of satisfaction with the study drug, participants were asked, "Please rate how well your pain has been controlled since you received study medication? (0-poor, 1-fair, 2-good, 3-very good, or 4-excellent)". This query was administered at 8 hours postdose, before discharge from the study center.

If a participant required rescue medication or was discontinued from the study within 8 hours postdose, the NPRS, PR, and treatment satisfaction were assessed and recorded at least 5 minutes before the first dose of rescue medication, known as "prerescue" scores, or upon early discontinuation from the study.

Additionally, the time to perceptible PR and time to meaningful PR were assessed using the "two-stopwatch" method. Two stopwatches were started immediately after T0. Each participant was given the first stopwatch and instructed to stop it when they first perceived PR, recording this as the time to perceptible PR. Once the first watch was stopped, participants received the second stopwatch with instructions to stop it when they first experienced meaningful PR, recording this as the time to meaningful PR.

Safety assessments included monitoring adverse events, clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, 12-lead electrocardiograms, and physical evaluations.
