## Question

Are there any specific patient populations in which the interaction between atorvastatin and diltiazem or verapamil is more significant?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether there are specific patient populations in which the interaction between atorvastatin and diltiazem or verapamil is more significant. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacokinetic mechanism and the expected magnitude of interaction. Then, I should verify which patient-specific factors amplify exposure or toxicity risk. Next, I will examine special populations where guidance or labeling flags heightened concern. After that, I should review clinical outcomes data for signals of harm. Finally, I will synthesize practical, risk-stratified recommendations and monitoring plans, making sure I double-check any numeric claims against the cited sources before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the mechanism and baseline interaction magnitude. Diltiazem and verapamil are moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors and P-gp inhibitors; atorvastatin is a CYP3A4 substrate and also a substrate of OATP1B1/1B3 and BCRP, so coadministration increases atorvastatin exposure and myopathy risk, though the effect with atorvastatin is generally smaller than with simvastatin or lovastatin, with the AHA describing a minor increase in exposure when atorvastatin is combined with diltiazem, on the order of roughly 1.5-fold in some contexts, which aligns with the FDA's characterization of a modest AUC increase that is not typically dose-limiting for atorvastatin itself [^f66f232a] [^fcf53c0d] [^fd568754].

> Wait, let me verify the magnitude claim I just made. I initially thought the AUC increase with diltiazem was uniformly about 1.5-fold, but I should correct that. The AHA notes a minor increase with atorvastatin plus diltiazem, whereas the 5-fold AUC increase is well-documented for simvastatin with diltiazem, not atorvastatin, so I need to be precise here to avoid overgeneralization. The correct takeaway is that atorvastatin's exposure increase is modest compared with simvastatin's large increase, and labeling for atorvastatin does not mandate a specific dose reduction solely for coadministration with diltiazem or verapamil, though vigilance is warranted [^fcf53c0d] [^1326a1b9] [^fd568754].

> Next, I should review patient-specific factors that amplify risk. Age 65 years or older, female sex, low body weight, renal impairment, hepatic impairment, hypothyroidism, and polypharmacy all increase susceptibility to statin-associated muscle symptoms. Importantly, the elderly have higher atorvastatin exposure, and hepatic impairment markedly increases atorvastatin AUC, which can compound with CYP3A4 inhibition from diltiazem or verapamil to raise myopathy risk, so I need to keep these baseline vulnerabilities in mind when assessing significance in a given patient [^fbf81137] [^32238d25] [^529f46d0].

> I will now examine special populations where guidance or labeling flags heightened concern. Patients with hepatic impairment have 4- to 16-fold higher atorvastatin exposure depending on severity, so adding a CYP3A4 inhibitor can push concentrations into a higher risk zone. Patients with severe renal impairment have reduced clearance of some statins and may be more vulnerable to muscle toxicity. Individuals of Asian ancestry have higher rosuvastatin exposure and may have differing statin pharmacokinetics, prompting lower starting doses in some labels. And patients with heart failure or reduced ejection fraction should generally avoid nondihydropyridine CCBs like diltiazem and verapamil due to negative inotropy, which indirectly affects the safety context of any statin–CCB combination in that population [^fbf81137] [^1ea4a92e] [^a93a4175].

> Hold on, I should verify the heart failure point because it is easy to conflate pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic issues. The concern in HFrEF is primarily pharmacodynamic — negative inotropy from diltiazem or verapamil — rather than a unique pharmacokinetic amplification of atorvastatin toxicity, but this still matters clinically because the overall risk-benefit of continuing the CCB may be unfavorable, and if the CCB is withdrawn, the interaction concern with atorvastatin becomes moot; thus, in HFrEF, the interaction is "more significant" in terms of global cardiovascular risk even if the PK magnitude with atorvastatin remains modest [^a93a4175].

> Next, I should review clinical outcome signals. Case reports document rhabdomyolysis with atorvastatin plus diltiazem, and large observational cohorts show that concomitant CYP3A4 inhibitors, including diltiazem and verapamil, are associated with increased muscle-related adverse events with statins, particularly simvastatin and lovastatin; while atorvastatin is less dramatically affected, the absolute risk still rises in vulnerable patients, reinforcing the need for individualized risk assessment and monitoring when these combinations are used [^a5fddc3f] [^529f46d0].

> Let me consider pharmacogenomic modifiers. SLCO1B1 polymorphisms can increase statin exposure and myopathy risk, and when combined with CYP3A4 inhibitors like diltiazem or verapamil, the net effect may be additive. Some pharmacogenetic guidelines advise switching to a non–CYP3A4-metabolized statin in SLCO1B1 variant carriers who require CYP3A4 inhibitors, which is a population where the interaction may be more clinically significant even if the PK magnitude appears "minor" on average [^89494080].

> I should double-check the practical, risk-stratified recommendations. For low-risk patients without hepatic or severe renal impairment, younger age, and no interacting drugs, atorvastatin with diltiazem or verapamil can proceed with routine monitoring. For moderate-risk patients, consider lowering the atorvastatin dose, spacing doses, and intensify CK and symptom surveillance. For high-risk patients — elderly, hepatic impairment, severe renal impairment, polypharmacy, or SLCO1B1 variants — preferentially switch to a non–CYP3A4 statin such as rosuvastatin or pravastatin, or if switching is not feasible, use the lowest effective atorvastatin dose with close monitoring. This aligns with AHA guidance and FDA labeling that do not mandate atorvastatin dose changes with diltiazem or verapamil but emphasize vigilance and agent selection in higher-risk scenarios [^f66f232a] [^fd568754] [^89494080].

> But wait, what if the patient is already on simvastatin or lovastatin rather than atorvastatin. I need to ensure I do not overapply atorvastatin-specific advice. With simvastatin or lovastatin, the interaction with diltiazem or verapamil is moderate to large, and labeling recommends limiting simvastatin to 10 mg daily and lovastatin to 20 mg daily, so in those cases the interaction is unequivocally more significant and dose reduction or statin switching is indicated, which is a different risk calculus than with atorvastatin [^1326a1b9] [^13313cb9].

> In summary, I should confirm the bottom line. The atorvastatin–diltiazem or atorvastatin–verapamil interaction is pharmacokinetically real but generally modest in magnitude. However, it becomes more clinically significant in patients with hepatic impairment, severe renal impairment, advanced age, low body weight, hypothyroidism, polypharmacy, SLCO1B1 genetic susceptibility, and in those with heart failure where nondihydropyridine CCBs are discouraged, warranting lower atorvastatin doses, enhanced monitoring, or preferential use of non–CYP3A4 statins to mitigate myopathy risk [^f66f232a] [^fbf81137] [^a93a4175] [^89494080].

---

The atorvastatin–diltiazem/verapamil interaction is **most clinically significant** in patients with hepatic impairment, advanced age, polypharmacy, or those on high-dose atorvastatin, due to increased exposure and myopathy risk [^fbf81137] [^529f46d0]. The interaction is **less pronounced than with simvastatin or lovastatin**, but caution is warranted in these populations, with consideration of dose reduction, closer monitoring, or switching to a non–CYP3A4 statin when feasible [^f66f232a] [^1326a1b9].

---

## Pharmacokinetic basis of the interaction

Atorvastatin is metabolized primarily by **CYP3A4**, with contributions from CYP3A5 and transporters such as P-gp and OATP1B1 [^a87eec45] [^fbf81137]. Diltiazem and verapamil are moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors and P-gp inhibitors, which can increase atorvastatin exposure and the risk of adverse effects, particularly myopathy and rhabdomyolysis [^f66f232a] [^fd568754].

---

## Clinical significance of the interaction

The clinical significance of the interaction varies by **patient population and clinical context**. The AHA notes that coadministration of atorvastatin with diltiazem results in a minor increase in statin exposure and is generally reasonable in appropriate patients, though caution is advised in higher-risk groups [^f66f232a] [^3463e3ca].

---

## Patient populations at increased risk

Several patient populations are at **increased risk** of clinically significant interactions between atorvastatin and diltiazem or verapamil:

| **Patient population** | **Rationale for increased risk** |
|-|-|
| Hepatic impairment | - Atorvastatin exposure is significantly increased in hepatic impairment <br/> - CYP3A4 inhibition further elevates levels [^fbf81137] [^c8cb7667] |
| Advanced age (≥ 65 years) | - Higher baseline atorvastatin exposure <br/> - Increased susceptibility to muscle-related adverse effects [^fbf81137] [^529f46d0] |
| Polypharmacy | - Multiple CYP3A4 substrates/inhibitors increase interaction risk <br/> - Higher likelihood of adverse drug reactions [^529f46d0] [^86e5e9ba] |
| High-dose atorvastatin therapy | - Greater baseline exposure <br/> - Higher risk of myopathy with additional CYP3A4 inhibition [^529f46d0] [^32238d25] |
| Genetic polymorphisms (e.g. SLCO1B1 variants) | - Increased statin exposure and myopathy risk <br/> - CYP3A4 inhibition compounds this effect [^89494080] [^529f46d0] |

---

## Clinical evidence supporting increased risk

Clinical studies and case reports provide evidence of **increased risk** in these populations:

- **Hepatic impairment**: Atorvastatin exposure increases 4-fold in Child-Pugh A and 11–16-fold in Child-Pugh B, significantly increasing myopathy risk when combined with CYP3A4 inhibitors [^fbf81137] [^c8cb7667].
- **Advanced age**: Elderly patients have higher atorvastatin exposure and increased susceptibility to muscle-related adverse effects, especially with CYP3A4 inhibition [^fbf81137] [^529f46d0].
- **Polypharmacy**: Real-world data show frequent coadministration of CYP3A4 inhibitors with statins, increasing adverse event risk [^7bb33a16] [^529f46d0].
- **High-dose atorvastatin**: Higher baseline exposure increases myopathy risk when CYP3A4 is inhibited [^529f46d0] [^32238d25].
- **Genetic polymorphisms**: SLCO1B1 variants increase statin exposure and myopathy risk, further amplified by CYP3A4 inhibition [^89494080] [^529f46d0].

---

## Clinical management strategies

Given the potential for increased risk, **clinicians should consider the following strategies**:

- **Dose adjustment**: Consider reducing atorvastatin dose when coadministered with diltiazem or verapamil, particularly in high-risk patients [^f66f232a] [^1326a1b9].
- **Alternative statins**: Use statins not metabolized by CYP3A4 (e.g. pravastatin, rosuvastatin) when feasible, especially in patients with hepatic impairment or polypharmacy [^f66f232a] [^1326a1b9].
- **Monitoring**: Closely monitor for muscle-related symptoms (myalgia, weakness, elevated CK) and liver enzymes, especially in high-risk populations [^529f46d0] [^32238d25].
- **Patient education**: Inform patients about symptoms of myopathy and the importance of reporting them promptly [^529f46d0] [^32238d25].

## Summary of evidence

| **Patient population** | **Evidence of increased risk** | **Recommended management** |
|-|-|-|
| Hepatic impairment | - 4–16 fold increase in atorvastatin exposure <br/> - Increased myopathy risk | - Avoid or use minimal dose <br/> - Consider alternative statin [^fbf81137] [^f66f232a] |
| Advanced age (≥ 65 years) | - Higher exposure <br/> - Increased myopathy susceptibility | - Lower dose <br/> - Close monitoring [^fbf81137] [^529f46d0] |
| Polypharmacy | - Multiple CYP3A4 interactions <br/> - Higher adverse event risk | - Review medications <br/> - Consider alternative statin [^529f46d0] [^f66f232a] |
| High-dose atorvastatin | - Greater baseline exposure <br/> - Higher myopathy risk | - Dose reduction <br/> - Close monitoring [^529f46d0] [^32238d25] |
| Genetic polymorphisms (SLCO1B1) | - Increased exposure <br/> - Higher myopathy risk | - Consider alternative statin <br/> - Close monitoring [^89494080] [^529f46d0] |

The interaction between atorvastatin and diltiazem or verapamil is **most clinically significant** in patients with hepatic impairment, advanced age, polypharmacy, or those on high-dose atorvastatin. Clinicians should individualize therapy, consider dose adjustments, and monitor closely for adverse effects, with alternative statins considered when appropriate [^f66f232a] [^1326a1b9].

Statin–calcium channel blocker combinations — dose limits and agent selection are specified as follows: Combination therapy with atorvastatin and diltiazem results in a minor increase in statin exposure and this combination therapy is reasonable. Diltiazem administered with either lovastatin or simvastatin is associated with moderate increases in statin exposure, although these combination therapies may be considered in appropriate patients. Coadministration of verapamil with lovastatin or simvastatin results in moderate increases in statin exposure. Therefore, these combination therapies may be considered when the potential for benefit outweighs potential risks. Doses of lovastatin or simvastatin > 20 mg daily when coadministered with amlodipine are not recommended. A non–CYP3A4-metabolized statin is preferred in combination with diltiazem or verapamil. Doses of simvastatin > 10 mg daily and doses of lovastatin > 20 mg daily when used with diltiazem or verapamil are not recommended. However, it should be noted that verapamil labeling recommends a higher dose limit of lovastatin of 40 mg daily when coadministered with verapamil. For adult patients on stable therapy with simvastatin 80 mg daily (a dose that is no longer recommended for general use), clinicians should change to a non–CYP3A4 statin such as pravastatin, rosuvastatin, or pitavastatin if therapy with diltiazem or verapamil is initiated. Caution should be exercised with statin-CCB combination therapy in patients of various ethnic backgrounds, particularly those of Asian descent.

Diltiazem and verapamil — effects on simvastatin and lovastatin exposure and product labeling are as follows: Diltiazem and verapamil are moderate to weak inhibitors of CYP3A4, and in 10 healthy volunteers diltiazem increased the Cmax of simvastatin by 3.6-fold and simvastatin acid by 3.7-fold (P < 0.05), with the AUC of simvastatin increased by 5-fold (P < 0.05) and the elimination t1/2 by 2.3-fold (P < 0.05); diltiazem also increased the AUC of lovastatin by 3.6-fold and Cmax from 6 ± 2 to 26 ± 9 ng/mL but did not change the elimination t1/2. Current labeling advises that the dose of simvastatin not exceed 10 mg daily when co-prescribed with diltiazem or verapamil in adult patients and that the dose of lovastatin not exceed 20 mg daily; the approved labeling for diltiazem recommends the use of non–CYP3A4-metabolized statins in combination with diltiazem if possible; the product labeling for atorvastatin does not include dose adjustments for combination therapy with amlodipine, diltiazem, or verapamil, and labeling for verapamil recommends that when coadministration lower doses of atorvastatin may be considered.

Strengths and Limitations

To our knowledge, this is the first real-world observational study that evaluated the drug-drug interaction between DOACs and verapamil or diltiazem vs active comparators. This design may help to reduce indication and healthy user biases, provide some control for disease severity, and also provide useful information for patients and prescribers when they need to consider an alternative treatment.

However, there are still several limitations in our study. First, we only looked at the use of verapamil, diltiazem, amlodipine, and metoprolol before DOAC initiation, and required 90 days of cumulative use of these medications during the previous 6-month period with strict criteria for censoring at discontinuation or switching of any study medication (DOACs or antihypertensives). While this approach substantially reduced our sample size, it helped to create a more homogeneous population of patients receiving long-term therapy with each medication and provided strong exposure definitions. Second, owing to the small sample size, we combined data on verapamil and diltiazem. Although this combination is not ideal from a study design perspective, both verapamil and diltiazem are categorized as combined P-gp inhibitors and moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors, have similar on-label and off-label indications, and are expected to behave similarly in terms of drug-drug interaction mechanisms.

As in all other observational studies, the potential of unmeasured confounding may not be avoided; however, we minimized this by having an active comparator study design in addition to IPTW methods and a large number of covariates. Owing to the limitations of claims data, we could not observe when patients administered the drugs; thus, our conclusions were based on the assumption that patients followed what had been recommended by physicians. Our exposure definition required continuous adherence with a small gap window (7-day) to ensure exposure. Likewise, the claims database would not include information on when patients acquired prescriptions not paid for by their insurance coverage, such as over-the-counter or sample medications, but this information is not expected to be imbalanced between treatment groups and would likely not affect the study results. Our results were consistent in direction and magnitude to several sensitivity analyses including use of standardized mortality ratio weighting in place of IPTW, use of a 15-day gap censor criterion, outcome measurement using all primary and secondary diagnoses, and separating verapamil and diltiazem.

American Heart Association scientific statement — drug-drug interaction (DDI) definitions and clinical impact are outlined, noting that a DDI is "a pharmacokinetic or pharmacological influence of 1 medication on another that differs from the known or anticipated effects of each agent alone", with pharmacokinetic DDIs altering "absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion" and pharmacodynamic DDIs occurring when one medication modifies another's effect "in an additive, a synergistic, or an antagonistic fashion"; it is estimated that ≈2.8% of hospital admissions occur as a direct result of DDIs, the clinical impact can range "from mild to life-threatening", and "not all DDIs require a modification in therapy", because significance depends on "both medication-specific and patient-specific factors"; clinically significant DDIs "are usually preventable", underscoring the need to understand "the mechanisms, magnitude, and potential consequences" of any given DDI.

Antihypertensive medication interactions — pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic categories are described with clinically relevant examples. Drug-drug interactions are categorized as either pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic, and important pharmacokinetic interactions involve the CYP3A4 pathway in which verapamil and diltiazem can alter metabolism. Beneficial pharmacodynamic combinations include a renin–angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitor with a thiazide-type diuretic to minimize hypokalemia or a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker (CCB) with a RAS inhibitor to reduce lower extremity edema, whereas combining angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) or direct renin inhibitors increases risk of hyperkalemia.

### Use of real-world claims data to assess the prevalence of concomitant medications to inform drug-drug interaction risk in target patient populations [^1bb9bc8e]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

For the HR+ BC cohort, despite underrepresentation of patients over 65 compared with the general US population, the 22% over age 65 can still provide insights around comorbidities and DDI risk. The top CYP3A4 inhibitors in the HR+ BC cohort include antifungals and antibiotics, with greater prevalence among the metastatic population, perhaps suggesting increased infection risk or immunocompromised status, such as from disease progression or cancer treatment; however, usage of antifungals and antibiotics is mostly given short‐term with an acute risk of DDI. Chronically utilized CYP3A4 inhibitors include medications for comorbid cardiovascular indications such as diltiazem and verapamil, with greater use among the elderly. This is of relevance since cardiovascular multimorbidity and age are associated with differing treatment approaches. Additionally, we see that chemotherapy antiemetics may pose an acute DDI risk within the BC treatment pathway. While the overall prevalence of CYP3A4 inducers is low, notable medications include those for concurrent seizures and psychiatric conditions. CYP3A4 substrates have high prevalence, with the top 10 medications being prescribed to 0.5%–20% of the population. These include medications for acute procedures (midazolam), chronic hyperlipidemia (atorvastatin, simvastatin), and anxiety (alprazolam, buspirone). Relevant P‐gp inhibitors have great overlap with both CYP3A4 inhibitors and substrates, particularly verapamil, amiodarone, and ranolazine, with greater usage in elderly patients and patients with metastasis. This complex DDI risk may explain prior studies that identified large differences in treatment approaches and outcomes based on age. For BC, antiemetic use (specifically rolapitant and aprepitant) may provide DDI risk for patients who may be exposed to chemotherapy, with greater use among the young and those with advanced disease. This suggests that DDI risk should be considered when cancer treatment‐related medications (such as antiemetics) are given concomitantly with chemotherapy, in BC as well as other tumor types.

### Association of oral anticoagulants and verapamil or diltiazem with adverse bleeding events in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation and normal kidney function [^d048bd71]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), first introduced into the market in 2010, have become more popular as a stroke prevention therapy for patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation owing to less complexity in therapeutic dosing in addition to equivalent efficacy and superior safety compared with warfarin. Even though adverse bleeding events are of less concern among patients receiving DOACs compared with those receiving traditional warfarin therapy, the risk of major bleeding events is still present. This risk can be further increased when DOACs are administered with other medications that inhibit their metabolic or absorption pathways, such as through CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibition.

The prevalence of hypertension is high among patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation — about 70% to 90% based on data from randomized clinical trials of DOACs, — and use of antihypertensive drugs is common. Verapamil hydrochloride and diltiazem hydrochloride are nondihydropyridine calcium-channel blocking antihypertensives that are also recommended as a heart rate control therapy for patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. As both drugs are combined P-gp and CYP3A4 inhibitors, they can contribute to clinically relevant drug-drug interactions when coadministered with DOACs. Little direct clinical evidence has been provided regarding these drug-drug interactions. An observational study by Chang et alfound no increased bleeding risk among patients receiving both DOACs and verapamil or diltiazem compared with those receiving DOACs alone. However, the lack of active comparators in that study could lead to insurmountable biases and residual confounding as pointed out by several response letters. Suspected drug-drug interactions should be evaluated individually using active control groups strategically selected to better overlap either in biological target or therapeutic use to the exposure of interest.

### Association of oral anticoagulants and verapamil or diltiazem with adverse bleeding events in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation and normal kidney function [^30fb83b5]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Our objective was to conduct a targeted comparative safety analysis of the potential drug-drug interaction between verapamil or diltiazem and DOACs using an active comparator study design to reduce the residual confounding present in existing real-world studies. An ideal active comparator should be either of the same medication class or be used for similar purposes as the reference product. Therefore, we selected 2 different comparators: amlodipine, a dihydropyridine calcium-channel blocking antihypertensive drug, and metoprolol, a β-blocker antihypertensive that is also recommended for heart rate control in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. These 2 drugs are not classified as P-gp or CYP3A4 inhibitors and provide similar pharmacologic pathways and therapeutic uses compared with verapamil and diltiazem. We aimed to compare the risk of major, moderate, and minor adverse bleeding events among patients with concomitant use of DOACs and verapamil or diltiazem vs concomitant use of DOACs and amlodipine or metoprolol.

### Amlodipine and atorvastatin [^c8cb7667]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Atorvastatin: In patients with chronic alcoholic liver disease, plasma concentrations of atorvastatin are markedly increased. Cmaxand AUC are each 4-fold greater in patients with Childs-Pugh A disease. Cmaxand AUC of atorvastatin are approximately 16-fold and 11-fold increased, respectively, in patients with Childs-Pugh B disease [see Use in Specific Populations)].

Atorvastatin is contraindicated in patients with active liver disease.

Heart Failure

Amlodipine: In patients with moderate to severe heart failure, the increase in AUC for amlodipine was similar to that seen in the elderly and in patients with hepatic insufficiency.

Effects of Other Drugs on Amlodipine and Atorvastatin

Amlodipine:

Co-administered cimetidine, magnesium-and aluminum hydroxide antacids, sildenafil, and grapefruit juice have no impact on the exposure to amlodipine.

CYP3A inhibitors: Co-administration of a 180 mg daily dose of diltiazem with 5 mg amlodipine in elderly hypertensive patients resulted in a 60% increase in amlodipine systemic exposure. Erythromycin co-administration in healthy volunteers did not significantly change amlodipine systemic exposure. However, strong inhibitors of CYP3A (e.g., itraconazole, clarithromycin) may increase the plasma concentrations of amlodipine to a greater extent [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

### Guidance for incorporating FDA processes into the ACC / AHA clinical practice guideline methodology: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^bd72e9cc]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Antihypertensive medication interactions — classification, CYP3A4 involvement, and combination effects — are described with practical examples: Drug-drug interactions are categorized as pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic, with key pharmacokinetic interactions involving the CYP3A4 pathway where verapamil and diltiazem can alter metabolism of other medications. Beneficial pharmacodynamic combinations include pairing a renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitor with a thiazide-type diuretic to minimize diuretic-induced hypokalemia or combining a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker (CCB) with a RAS inhibitor to reduce lower extremity edema, whereas overlapping mechanisms such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) plus angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) or direct renin inhibitor increase the risk of hyperkalemia as an adverse pharmacodynamic interaction.

### Association of oral anticoagulants and verapamil or diltiazem with adverse bleeding events in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation and normal kidney function [^90edba6c]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Discussion

In our study of patients with no history of kidney disease receiving DOACs who had received a standard dose of each drug, use of dabigatran with concomitant verapamil or diltiazem was associated with an increased risk of bleeding compared with the combination of DOACs with amlodipine or metoprolol. There were no statistically significant findings for comparisons within groups using rivaroxaban or apixaban with verapamil or diltiazem vs the active comparison groups. To our knowledge, these findings provide the first real-world evidence of the pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions between these medications and suggest that caution may be necessary when coprescribing dabigatran with common antihypertensive medications — verapamil and diltiazem — and possibly other moderate to strong P-gp inhibitors regardless of kidney function.

Dabigatran is a prodrug that undergoes efflux by P-gp and subsequent elimination via the intestinal tract or other elimination organs and is not a substrate for CYP450 enzymes. Thus, inhibition of P-gp increases the bioavailability of the prodrug, leading to increased serum concentrations of the active metabolite. Verapamil and diltiazem are moderate to strong P-gp inhibitors along with other common medications, such as amiodarone, proton-pump inhibitors, some antidepressants, and azole antifungals. In US Food and Drug Administration briefing documents, verapamil, used as a reference agent for drug-drug interactions, was reported to increase the area under the curve of dabigatran by over 143% with a single concomitant dose and by 18% when separated by a 2-hour dosing interval. In the phase 3 RE-LY clinical trial, P-gp inhibition led to an increase in major bleeding event rates (4.12% vs 2.96% for 150 mg dose; 3.99% vs 2.38% for 110 mg dose) though these findings were not statistically significant given the sample size in the trial. These figures represented a relative increase in bleeding risk of 39% to 68%, which are consistent with the findings from this study.

### Drug interactions with lipid-lowering drugs: mechanisms and clinical relevance [^8b0c9f2a]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2006). Low credibility.

Lipid-lowering drugs, especially 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A inhibitors (statins), are widely used in the treatment and prevention of atherosclerotic disease. The benefits of statins are well documented. However, lipid-lowering drugs may cause myopathy, even rhabdomyolysis, the risk of which is increased by certain interactions. Simvastatin, lovastatin, and atorvastatin are metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 (simvastatin acid is also metabolized by CYP2C8); their plasma concentrations and risk of myotoxicity are greatly increased by strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (eg, itraconazole and ritonavir). Weak or moderately potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (eg, verapamil and diltiazem) can be used cautiously with small doses of CYP3A4-dependent statins. Cerivastatin is metabolized by CYP2C8 and CYP3A4, and fluvastatin is metabolized by CYP2C9. The exposure to fluvastatin is increased by less than 2-fold by inhibitors of CYP2C9. Pravastatin, rosuvastatin, and pitavastatin are excreted mainly unchanged, and their plasma concentrations are not significantly increased by pure CYP3A4 inhibitors. Cyclosporine (INN, ciclosporin) inhibits CYP3A4, P-glycoprotein (multidrug resistance protein 1), organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B1 (OATP1B1), and some other hepatic uptake transporters. Gemfibrozil and its glucuronide inhibit CYP2C8 and OATP1B1. These effects of cyclosporine and gemfibrozil explain the increased plasma statin concentrations and, together with pharmacodynamic factors, the increased risk of myotoxicity when coadministered with statins. Inhibitors of OATP1B1 may decrease the benefit/risk ratio of statins by interfering with their entry into hepatocytes, the site of action. Lipid-lowering drugs can be involved also in other interactions, including those between enzyme inducers and CYP3A4 substrate statins, as well as those between gemfibrozil and CYP2C8 substrate antidiabetics. Knowledge of the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of lipid-lowering drugs and their interaction mechanisms helps to avoid adverse interactions, without compromising therapeutic benefits.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Medication interactions in hypertension management — drug–drug interactions are categorized as pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic, and knowledge of these interactions is essential; important pharmacokinetic interactions involve the CYP3A4 pathway because verapamil and diltiazem are both substrates and inhibitors of CYP3A4 and can alter the metabolism of other medications, beneficial pharmacodynamic pairs include an RAS inhibitor with a thiazide-type diuretic to minimize diuretic-induced hypokalemia or a dihydropyridine CCB with an RAS inhibitor to reduce lower extremity edema, whereas combining drugs with overlapping mechanisms like ACEI and ARB or direct renin inhibitors leads to an increased risk of hyperkalemia.

### Concomitant use of diltiazem with direct oral anticoagulants and bleeding risk in atrial fibrillation [^0d676232]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Although it is well established that CYP3A4 and/or P‐gp inhibitors can increase DOAC bioavailability and inhibit ≥ 1 clearance pathway simultaneously, real‐world evidence is limited and controversial. An early case‐cohort study of 286 patients from a single center found no difference in bleeding risk comparing patients taking rivaroxaban with and without diltiazem. However, the results were likely biased because of inclusion of prevalent rivaroxaban users in the diltiazem‐exposed group only (ie, less susceptible to bleeding). A recent retrospective cohort study at the same institution used an incident user design and propensity score matching, and found an increased risk of bleeding with combined P‐gp and moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors including diltiazem (HR, 1.80; 95% CI, 1.19–2.73). Chang et aldid not find a difference in the risk of bleeding with diltiazem use in a large cohort of 91 330 patients with AF who used DOACs in Taiwan. However, Chang et al's study results were likely biased because of the incomplete control of confounders such as kidney function and concurrent medication use, and the inclusion of medications that may not interact with DOACs (eg, digoxin and atorvastatin). In our study, we adjusted for eGFR and concurrent medications such as NSAIDs, antiplatelets, and other CYP3A4/P‐gp agents in a time‐varying manner. On the other hand, Pham et alfound increased bleeding risk in patients using dabigatran with diltiazem compared with those with amlodipine (HR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.05–2.20) or with metoprolol (HR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.02–2.00). However, this study excluded patients with CKD, and the study population of patients without CKD was younger (≈60% aged < 65 years) and healthier than the general AF population (mean age, 70 to 74 years), which limited the ability to generalize the results to real‐world DOAC users. In the present study, we had limited power in dabigatran users (≈12% of the study population with 37 bleeding events). Of note, while we used a validated algorithm to ascertain bleeding outcome, heterogeneity in definitions of bleeding outcome among the studies (eg, inclusion of minor bleeding) may have partly contributed to inconsistencies in the studies.

### Amlodipine besylate and atorvastatin calcium [^89df3cb3]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

Hemodialysis

While studies have not been conducted in patients with end-stage renal disease, hemodialysis is not expected to clear atorvastatin or amlodipine since both drugs are extensively bound to plasma proteins.

Hepatic Impairment

Amlodipine: Elderly patients and patients with hepatic insufficiency have decreased clearance of amlodipine with a resulting increase in AUC of approximately 40 to 60%.

Atorvastatin: In patients with chronic alcoholic liver disease, plasma concentrations of atorvastatin are markedly increased. Cmaxand AUC are each 4-fold greater in patients with Childs-Pugh A disease. Cmaxand AUC of atorvastatin are approximately 16-fold and 11-fold increased, respectively, in patients with Childs-Pugh B disease [see Contraindications (4)].

Atorvastatin is contraindicated in patients with active liver disease.

Heart Failure

Amlodipine: In patients with moderate to severe heart failure, the increase in AUC for amlodipine was similar to that seen in the elderly and in patients with hepatic insufficiency.

Effects of Other Drugs on Amlodipine besylate and atorvastatin calcium

Amlodipine:

Co-administered cimetidine, magnesium-and aluminum hydroxide antacids, sildenafil, and grapefruit juice have no impact on the exposure to amlodipine.

CYP3A inhibitors: Co-administration of a 180 mg daily dose of diltiazem with 5 mg amlodipine in elderly hypertensive patients resulted in a 60% increase in amlodipine systemic exposure. Erythromycin co-administration in healthy volunteers did not significantly change amlodipine systemic exposure. However, strong inhibitors of CYP3A (e.g., itraconazole, clarithromycin) may increase the plasma concentrations of amlodipine to a greater extent [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

### Amlodipine besylate and atorvastatin calcium (Caduet) [^906f38a4]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Effects of Other Drugs on CADUET

Amlodipine:

Co-administered cimetidine, magnesium-and aluminum hydroxide antacids, sildenafil, and grapefruit juice have no impact on the exposure to amlodipine.

CYP3A inhibitors: Co-administration of a 180 mg daily dose of diltiazem with 5 mg amlodipine in elderly hypertensive patients resulted in a 60% increase in amlodipine systemic exposure. Erythromycin co-administration in healthy volunteers did not significantly change amlodipine systemic exposure. However, strong inhibitors of CYP3A (e.g., itraconazole, clarithromycin) may increase the plasma concentrations of amlodipine to a greater extent [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

Atorvastatin:

Atorvastatin is a substrate of the hepatic transporters, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 transporter. Metabolites of atorvastatin are substrates of OATP1B1. Atorvastatin is also identified as a substrate of the efflux transporter BCRP, which may limit the intestinal absorption and biliary clearance of atorvastatin.

Table 6 shows effects of other drugs on the pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin.

Effects of CADUET on Other Drugs

Amlodipine:

Amlodipine is a weak inhibitor of CYP3A and may increase exposure to CYP3A substrates.

In vitro data indicate that amlodipine has no effect on the human plasma protein binding of digoxin, phenytoin, warfarin, and indomethacin.

Co-administered amlodipine does not affect the exposure to atorvastatin, digoxin, ethanol and the warfarin prothrombin response time.

Cyclosporine: A prospective study in renal transplant patients (N = 11) showed on an average of 40% increase in trough cyclosporine levels when concomitantly treated with amlodipine [see Drug Interactions (7.2)].

Tacrolimus: A prospective study in healthy Chinese volunteers (N = 9) with CYP3A5 expressers showed a 2.5- to 4-fold increase in tacrolimus exposure when concomitantly administered with amlodipine compared to tacrolimus alone. This finding was not observed in CYP3A5 non-expressers (N = 6). However, a 3-fold increase in plasma exposure to tacrolimus in a renal transplant patient (CYP3A5 non-expresser) upon initiation of amlodipine for the treatment of post-transplant hypertension resulting in reduction of tacrolimus dose has been reported. Irrespective of the CYP3A5 genotype status, the possibility of an interaction cannot be excluded with these drugs [see Drug Interactions (7.2)].

Atorvastatin:

Table 7 shows the effects of atorvastatin on the pharmacokinetics of other drugs.

Atorvastatin had no clinically significant effect on prothrombin time when administered to patients receiving chronic warfarin treatment.

### Diltiazem hydrochloride (Cardizem LA) [^1326a1b9]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Statins: Diltiazem has been shown to increase significantly the AUC of some statins. The risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis with statins metabolized by CYP3A4 may be increased with concomitant use of diltiazem. When possible, use a non-CYP3A4-metabolized statin together with diltiazem; otherwise, dose adjustments for both diltiazem and the statin should be considered along with close monitoring for signs and symptoms of any statin-related adverse events.

In a healthy volunteer cross-over study (N = 10), coadministration of a single 20 mg dose of simvastatin at the end of a 14-day regimen with 120 mg BID diltiazem SR resulted in a 5-fold increase in mean simvastatin AUC versus simvastatin alone. Subjects with increased average steady-state exposures of diltiazem showed a greater fold increase in simvastatin exposure. Computer-based simulations showed that at a daily dose of 480 mg of diltiazem, an 8- to 9-fold mean increase in simvastatin AUC can be expected. If coadministration of simvastatin with diltiazem is required, limit the daily doses of simvastatin to 10 mg and diltiazem to 240 mg.

In a 10-subject randomized, open label, 4-way cross-over study, coadministration of diltiazem (120 mg BID diltiazem SR for 2 weeks) with a single 20 mg dose of lovastatin resulted in 3- to 4-fold increase in mean lovastatin AUC and Cmaxversus lovastatin alone. In the same study, there was no significant change in 20 mg single dose pravastatin AUC and Cmaxduring diltiazem coadministration. Diltiazem plasma levels were not significantly affected by lovastatin or pravastatin.

### Comparative pharmacokinetic interaction profiles of pravastatin, simvastatin, and atorvastatin when coadministered with cytochrome P450 inhibitors [^130f950b]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2004). Low credibility.

Three-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme-A reductase inhibitors (statins) are first-line treatments for hypercholesterolemia. Although exceedingly well tolerated, treatment with statins incurs a small risk of myopathy or potentially fatal rhabdomyolysis, particularly when coadministered with medications that increase their systemic exposure. Studies compared the multiple-dose pharmacokinetic interaction profiles of pravastatin, simvastatin, and atorvastatin when coadministered with 4 inhibitors of cytochrome P450-3A4 isoenzymes in healthy subjects. Compared with pravastatin alone, coadministration of verapamil, mibefradil, or itraconazole with pravastatin was associated with no significant changes in pravastatin pharmacokinetics. However, concomitant verapamil increased the simvastatin area under the concentration:time curve (AUC) approximately fourfold, the maximum serum concentration (C(max)) fivefold, and the active metabolite simvastatin acid AUC and C(max) approximately four- and threefold, respectively (all comparisons p < 0.001). Similar (greater than fourfold) important increases in these parameters and a > 60% increase in the serum half-life (p = 0.03) of atorvastatin were observed when coadministered with mibefradil. The half-life of atorvastatin also increased by approximately 60% (p = 0.052) when coadministered with itraconazole, which elicited a 2.4-fold increase in the C(max) of atorvastatin and a 47% increase in the AUC (p < 0.001 for C(max) and AUC). Clarithromycin significantly (p < 0.001) increased the AUC (and C(max)) of all 3 statins, most markedly simvastatin (approximately 10-fold increase in AUC) and simvastatin acid (12-fold), followed by atorvastatin (greater than fourfold) and then pravastatin (almost twofold). Pravastatin has a neutral drug interaction profile relative to cytochrome P450-3A4 inhibitors, but these substrates markedly increase systemic exposure to simvastatin and atorvastatin.

### Association of oral anticoagulants and verapamil or diltiazem with adverse bleeding events in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation and normal kidney function [^3dfa2e68]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Importance

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are purported to have fewer drug-drug interactions than warfarin. However, potential interactions with coprescribed medications are still a safety concern. Verapamil hydrochloride and diltiazem hydrochloride are combined P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and CYP3A4 inhibitors and may be associated with increases in the risk of bleeding with DOACs.

Objective

To evaluate the risk of bleeding with DOACs and verapamil or diltiazem using an active comparator design.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A comparative effectiveness active comparator cohort study was conducted using US population-based data (2010–2015) analyzed between January 1 and July 15, 2019. Data were obtained on 48 442 patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation who had received an index prescription of dabigatran, rivaroxaban, or apixaban between October 19, 2010, through June 30, 2015, with final follow-up on October 1, 2015. Analysis was restricted to individuals with no history of kidney disease who were receiving standard doses of the DOACs.

Exposures

Patients with initial prescriptions of DOACs who were receiving verapamil or diltiazem were compared with those receiving amlodipine or metoprolol.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Overall and gastrointestinal major, moderate, and minor bleeding using primary or secondary diagnoses. Hazard ratios and 95% CIs were estimated using inverse probability of treatment weights in Cox proportional hazards regression models.

Results

Of the 48 442 patients reviewed, analysis was conducted on 1764 patients receiving DOACs with verapamil or diltiazem compared with3105 receiving amlodipine and 1793 patients receiving DOACs with verapamil or diltiazem compared with 3224 receiving metoprolol. Depending on the comparison, approximately 60% of the cohort were younger than 65 years and male, which differed by treatment group. Rivaroxaban and apixaban were not associated with increased rates of bleeding for patients receiving verapamil or diltiazem compared with those receiving amlodipine or metoprolol. Among patients receiving dabigatran etexilate, the overall bleeding rate was 52% higher (hazard ratio, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.05–2.20) with verapamil or diltiazem vs amlodipine and 43% higher (hazard ratio, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.02–2.00) vs metoprolol. Bleeding rates for dabigatran with verapamil or diltiazem were higher overall for other bleeding types (244.9 vs 158.4 per 1000 person-years; adjusted hazard ratios of overall GI bleeding: 2.16; 95% CI, 1.30–3.60; minor bleeding: 1.56; 95% CI, 1.07–2.27; and minor GI bleeding: 2.16; 95% CI, 1.29–3.63). Sensitivity analyses showed consistent results for dabigatran when used with verapamil and diltiazem, with magnitudes ranging from 50% to 100% increased hazard rates and no significant results for apixaban or rivaroxaban.

Conclusions and Relevance

Current US prescribing information only recommends prescribing changes with dabigatran and P-gp inhibitors with lower kidney function. This study found increased bleeding risk associated with dabigatran when used concomitantly with the P-gp inhibitors verapamil and diltiazem in individuals with normal kidney function. Clinicians and patients may need to consider these drug-drug interactions when choosing oral anticoagulation.

### Concomitant drug interactions with non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants are associated with bleeding and mortality risk in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation [^f4d1355a]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Sensitivity Analysis

The sensitivity analysis, which restricted follow‐up duration to 1 year, showed findings largely consistent with the main study results (Table S4). Erythromycin was associated with increased intracranial hemorrhage at 1 year (adjusted HR, 8.65; P = 0.03*), although this association was not observed in the full duration cohort. Similarly, elevated hospitalization rates for bleeding were found at 1 year with diltiazem (adjusted HR, 1.29; P = 0.01*), antidepressants (adjusted HR, 1.29; P = 0.04*), and erythromycin (adjusted HR, 3.66; P = 0.03*), but these associations did not persist in the full duration analysis. Although not reaching statistical significance, there were trends toward higher all‐cause mortality with verapamil (P = 0.05) at 1 year, although statistical significance was not reached. All other findings from the 1‐year sensitivity analysis remained consistent with the main study results.

### Erythromycin [^530f280a]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Drug Interactions

Serious adverse reactions have been reported in patients taking erythromycin concomitantly with CYP3A4 substrates. These include colchicine toxicity with colchicine; rhabdomyolysis with simvastatin, lovastatin, and atorvastatin; and hypotension with calcium channel blockers metabolized by CYP3A4 (for example, verapamil, amlodipine, diltiazem) (see PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions).

There have been post-marketing reports of colchicine toxicity with concomitant use of erythromycin and colchicine. This interaction is potentially life-threatening, and may occur while using both drugs at their recommended doses (see PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions).

Rhabdomyolysis with or without renal impairment has been reported in seriously ill patients receiving erythromycin concomitantly with lovastatin. Therefore, patients receiving concomitant lovastatin and erythromycin should be carefully monitored for creatine kinase (CK) and serum transaminase levels. (See package insert for lovastatin.)

### Concomitant drug interactions with non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants are associated with bleeding and mortality risk in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation [^a2f23f5d]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Non–vitamin K oral anticoagulants prevent stroke and systemic embolism in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. However, potential drug interactions with concomitant medications may compromise their efficacy and escalate the risk of adverse effects.

Methods and Results

We conducted a territory‐wide retrospective cohort study in Hong Kong, focusing on nonvalvular atrial fibrillation prescribed non–vitamin K oral anticoagulants. The objective was to investigate the associated risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, intracranial hemorrhage, hospitalization for major bleeding, and all‐cause mortality in relation to various concomitant medications. Our analysis included 22 568 patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (aged 75.7 ± 10.8 years; 51.2% men) taking non–vitamin K oral anticoagulants from January 1, 2017, to December 31, 2020, totaling 40 317 patient‐years. It was found that amiodarone (hazard ratio [HR], 1.53), digoxin (HR, 1.30), diltiazem (HR, 1.18), clarithromycin (HR, 4.98), and fluconazole (HR, 2.38) were associated with increased gastrointestinal bleeding, whereas amiodarone (HR, 2.20) and digoxin (HR, 1.61) were associated with increased intracranial hemorrhage. Furthermore, amiodarone (HR, 1.64), digoxin (HR, 1.35), clarithromycin (HR, 4.18), and fluconazole (HR, 2.40) were associated with increased hospitalization for major bleeding. Additionally, amiodarone (HR, 2.65), digoxin (HR, 1.85), diltiazem (HR, 1.44), verapamil (HR, 1.80), antidepressants (HR, 1.31), and fluconazole (HR, 3.27) were associated with increased all‐cause mortality. Conversely, dronedarone (HR, 0.56) and atorvastatin (HR, 0.86) were associated with a significant reduction in all‐cause mortality.

Conclusions

For patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation taking non–vitamin K oral anticoagulants, several concurrent medications were associated with increased risks of intracranial hemorrhage, major bleeding hospitalizations, and overall mortality.

### Recommendations for management of clinically significant drug-drug interactions with statins and select agents used in patients with cardiovascular disease: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^7a6a35b1]. Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Digoxin–statin interactions — quantitative effects and monitoring — are described with atorvastatin as a potential contributor to digoxin exposure. In a study that included 24 healthy volunteers, the addition of atorvastatin 80 mg to digoxin resulted in an average increase of 20% in the Cmax of digoxin and an average 15% increase in the AUC of digoxin, whereas lower doses of atorvastatin (10 mg) did not alter digoxin pharmacokinetics. Atorvastatin is the only statin that appears to be associated with a potential DDI when used in combination with digoxin, and patients on higher doses of atorvastatin may be at increased risk of digoxin toxicity, with closer monitoring recommended; nonetheless, digoxin coadministration with any statin is reasonable if clinically indicated.

Methods

Selection of drug-gene interactions and classification of therapeutic recommendations

The methodology for guideline development of the DPWG has been described in detail previously. For this study, the DPWG guidelines were reviewed for drugs with an actionable therapeutic recommendation for a least one phenotype. Therapeutic recommendations were classified in no action, lower dose, higher dose, alternate drug, additional clinical monitoring of the patient, optional lower dose, optional higher dose, and a maximum dose threshold. Additionally, the guidelines were checked to see whether the therapeutic recommendations were dependent on patient characteristics such as age and concomitant use of other medication. For citalopram and escitalopram, the therapeutic recommendations are dependent on the age of the patient as a lower dose is recommended for patients ≥ 65 years of age. Secondly, for SLCO1B1 and atorvastatin, the therapeutic recommendation depends on concomitant use of a CYP3A4 inhibiting drug, i.e. amiodarone, verapamil, or diltiazem. Patients with a SLCO1B1 521TC or CC genotype and a CYP3A4 inhibitor are advised to switch to rosuvastatin or pravastatin, whereas in patients without a CYP3A4 inhibitor only increased monitoring for muscle pain is recommended.

Source of nationwide prescription data

The Foundation of Pharmaceutical Statistics (Stichting Farmaceutische Kengetallen, SFK) collects data on dispensed drugs from ~ 95% of all the community pharmacies in The Netherlands. To this end, patients are assigned an anonymous identification number that allows tracking within the participating community pharmacies. To this end, patients are assigned an anonymous identification number that allows tracking within the participating community pharmacies. For this study, dispensing data concerning first prescription for the period January 1–December 31, 2016, were obtained. First prescriptions in The Netherlands are defined by healthcare insurers as the dispensing of a drug that has not been used by the patient in the prior 365 days. For citalopram, escitalopram, and atorvastatin, additional information concerning age, and concomitant medication of the patients were also collected.

Statin drug–drug interactions — ticagrelor increases atorvastatin exposure with minor 1.4-fold increase in AUC and combination is reasonable, and decreases metabolism of lovastatin and simvastatin leading to increased concentrations with moderate 2- to 3-fold increase in AUC for each, for which combination may be considered.

Statin exposure

For the dose-response analyses, we generated a statin exposure variable, taking into account the different statins and their relative potency as well as SLCO1B1 genotype and pharmacokinetic interactions with co-administered drugs known to affect statin concentrations to a clinically relevant extent. When generating the predicted statin exposure variable, equipotent doses was converted using simvastatin as reference, e.g. 10 mg atorvastatin was defined an exposure similar to 20 mg simvastatin, 10 mg rosuvastatin as an exposure similar to 40 mg simvastatin, and 10 mg pravastatin as an exposure similar to 5 mg simvastatin. As pharmacokinetic differences may alter the effective dose of statins, the calculated dose equivalents were corrected for the expected exposure changes of drug-drug interactions. To identify potential pharmacokinetic drug interactions with statins, we searched a database established by the Norwegian Medicines Agency. Three identified interactions were considered of clinical relevance among the included simvastatin-treated patients, and those were amlodipine, diltiazem and amiodarone, which are CYP3A4 inhibitors increasing serum levels of simvastatin about 1.5-fold, 3-fold, and 1.7-fold, respectively. For atorvastatin, pravastatin and rosuvastatin, no clinically relevant interactions were identified in the database searches.

### Erythromycin ethylsuccinate (E.e.s) [^ff8b6544]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Drug Interactions

Serious adverse reactions have been reported in patients taking erythromycin concomitantly with CYP3A4 substrates. These include colchicine toxicity with colchicine; rhabdomyolysis with simvastatin, lovastatin, and atorvastatin; and hypotension with calcium channel blockers metabolized by CYP3A4 (e.g., verapamil, amlodipine, diltiazem) (see PRECAUTIONS – Drug Interactions).

There have been post-marketing reports of colchicine toxicity with concomitant use of erythromycin and colchicine. This interaction is potentially life-threatening, and may occur while using both drugs at their recommended doses (see PRECAUTIONS – Drug Interactions).

Rhabdomyolysis with or without renal impairment has been reported in seriously ill patients receiving erythromycin concomitantly with lovastatin. Therefore, patients receiving concomitant lovastatin and erythromycin should be carefully monitored for creatine kinase (CK) and serum transaminase levels. (See package insert for lovastatin.)

### Concomitant drug interactions with non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants are associated with bleeding and mortality risk in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation [^3c587450]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants prevent stroke and systemic embolism in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. However, potential drug interactions with concomitant medications may compromise their efficacy and escalate the risk of adverse effects.

Methods and Results

We conducted a territory-wide retrospective cohort study in Hong Kong, focusing on nonvalvular atrial fibrillation prescribed non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants. The objective was to investigate the associated risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, intracranial hemorrhage, hospitalization for major bleeding, and all-cause mortality in relation to various concomitant medications. Our analysis included 22568 patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (aged 75.7 ± 10.8years; 51.2% men) taking non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants from January 1, 2017, to December 31, 2020, totaling 40317 patient-years. It was found that amiodarone (hazard ratio [HR], 1.53), digoxin (HR, 1.30), diltiazem (HR, 1.18), clarithromycin (HR, 4.98), and fluconazole (HR, 2.38) were associated with increased gastrointestinal bleeding, whereas amiodarone (HR, 2.20) and digoxin (HR, 1.61) were associated with increased intracranial hemorrhage. Furthermore, amiodarone (HR, 1.64), digoxin (HR, 1.35), clarithromycin (HR, 4.18), and fluconazole (HR, 2.40) were associated with increased hospitalization for major bleeding. Additionally, amiodarone (HR, 2.65), digoxin (HR, 1.85), diltiazem (HR, 1.44), verapamil (HR, 1.80), antidepressants (HR, 1.31), and fluconazole (HR, 3.27) were associated with increased all-cause mortality. Conversely, dronedarone (HR, 0.56) and atorvastatin (HR, 0.86) were associated with a significant reduction in all-cause mortality.

Conclusions

For patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation taking non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants, several concurrent medications were associated with increased risks of intracranial hemorrhage, major bleeding hospitalizations, and overall mortality.

### Association between use of non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants with and without concurrent medications and risk of major bleeding in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation [^b5698adc]. JAMA (2017). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants (NOACs) are commonly prescribed with other medications that share metabolic pathways that may increase major bleeding risk.

Objective

To assess the association between use of NOACs with and without concurrent medications and risk of major bleeding in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Retrospective cohort study using data from the Taiwan National Health Insurance database and including 91 330 patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation who received at least 1 NOAC prescription of dabigatran, rivaroxaban, or apixaban from January 1, 2012, through December 31, 2016, with final follow-up on December 31, 2016.

Exposures

NOAC with or without concurrent use of atorvastatin; digoxin; verapamil; diltiazem; amiodarone; fluconazole; ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, or posaconazole; cyclosporine; erythromycin or clarithromycin; dronedarone; rifampin; or phenytoin.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Major bleeding, defined as hospitalization or emergency department visit with a primary diagnosis of intracranial hemorrhage or gastrointestinal, urogenital, or other bleeding. Adjusted incidence rate differences between person-quarters (exposure time for each person during each quarter of the calendar year) of NOAC with or without concurrent medications were estimated using Poisson regression and inverse probability of treatment weighting using the propensity score.

Results

Among 91 330 patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (mean age, 74.7 years [SD, 10.8]; men, 55.8%; NOAC exposure: dabigatran, 45 347 patients; rivaroxaban, 54 006 patients; and apixaban, 12 886 patients), 4770 major bleeding events occurred during 447 037 person-quarters with NOAC prescriptions. The most common medications co-prescribed with NOACs over all person-quarters were atorvastatin (27.6%), diltiazem (22.7%), digoxin (22.5%), and amiodarone (21.1%). Concurrent use of amiodarone, fluconazole, rifampin, and phenytoin with NOACs had a significant increase in adjusted incidence rates per 1000 person-years of major bleeding than NOACs alone: 38.09 for NOAC use alone vs 52.04 for amiodarone (difference, 13.94 [99% CI, 9.76–18.13]); 102.77 for NOAC use alone vs 241.92 for fluconazole (difference, 138.46 [99% CI, 80.96–195.97]); 65.66 for NOAC use alone vs 103.14 for rifampin (difference, 36.90 [99% CI, 1.59–72.22); and 56.07 for NOAC use alone vs 108.52 for phenytoin (difference, 52.31 [99% CI, 32.18–72.44]; P < .01 for all comparisons). Compared with NOAC use alone, the adjusted incidence rate for major bleeding was significantly lower for concurrent use of atorvastatin, digoxin, and erythromycin or clarithromycin and was not significantly different for concurrent use of verapamil; diltiazem; cyclosporine; ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, or posaconazole; and dronedarone.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among patients taking NOACs for nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, concurrent use of amiodarone, fluconazole, rifampin, and phenytoin compared with the use of NOACs alone, was associated with increased risk of major bleeding. Physicians prescribing NOAC medications should consider the potential risks associated with concomitant use of other drugs.

### Prasugrel hydrochloride (effient) [^86da7988]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

Potential for Other Drugs to Affect Prasugrel

Inhibitors of CYP3A - Ketoconazole (400 mg daily), a selective and potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 and CYP3A5, did not affect prasugrel-mediated inhibition of platelet aggregation or the active metabolite's AUC and Tmax, but decreased the Cmaxby 34% to 46%. Therefore, CYP3A inhibitors such as verapamil, diltiazem, indinavir, ciprofloxacin, clarithromycin, and grapefruit juice are not expected to have a significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of the active metabolite of prasugrel [see Drug Interactions (7.4)].

Inducers of Cytochromes P450 - Rifampicin (600 mg daily), a potent inducer of CYP3A and CYP2B6 and an inducer of CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2C8, did not significantly change the pharmacokinetics of prasugrel's active metabolite or its inhibition of platelet aggregation. Therefore, known CYP3A inducers such as rifampicin, carbamazepine, and other inducers of cytochromes P450 are not expected to have significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of the active metabolite of prasugrel [see Drug Interactions (7.4)].

Drugs that Elevate Gastric pH - Daily coadministration of ranitidine (an H2blocker) or lansoprazole (a proton pump inhibitor) decreased the Cmaxof the prasugrel active metabolite by 14% and 29%, respectively, but did not change the active metabolite's AUC and Tmax. In TRITON-TIMI 38, Effient was administered without regard to coadministration of a proton pump inhibitor or H2blocker [see Drug Interactions (7.4)].

Statins - Atorvastatin (80 mg daily), a drug metabolized by CYP450 3A4, did not alter the pharmacokinetics of prasugrel's active metabolite or its inhibition of platelet aggregation [see Drug Interactions (7.4)].

Heparin - A single intravenous dose of unfractionated heparin (100 units/kg) did not significantly alter coagulation or the prasugrel-mediated inhibition of platelet aggregation; however, bleeding time was increased compared with either drug alone [see Drug Interactions (7.4)].

Aspirin - Aspirin 150 mg daily did not alter prasugrel-mediated inhibition of platelet aggregation; however, bleeding time was increased compared with either drug alone [see Drug Interactions (7.4)].

Warfarin - A significant prolongation of the bleeding time was observed when prasugrel was coadministered with 15 mg of warfarin [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

### Drug-drug interactions and the clinical tolerability of colchicine among patients with COVID-19: a secondary analysis of the COLCORONA randomized clinical trial [^709fabd8]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Are drug-drug interactions associated with the clinical safety and efficacy of colchicine in people with COVID-19?

Findings

In this secondary analysis of the COLCORONA trial including 4432 patients, interactions with statins and calcium channel blockers did not modify the association between randomization to colchicine vs placebo and the risk of any safety end point. Findings were similar for efficacy end points.

Meaning

The findings of this study suggest that drug-drug interaction-associated changes in colchicine pharmacokinetics do not translate into clinically significant changes in its safety and efficacy profile.

### Diltiazem hydrochloride (diltiazem HCl CD) [^703ea351]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

Statins: Diltiazem is an inhibitor of CYP3A4 and has been shown to increase significantly the AUC of some statins. The risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis with statins metabolized by CYP3A4 may be increased with concomitant use of diltiazem. When possible, use a non-CYP3A4-metabolized statin together with diltiazem; otherwise, monitor for signs and symptoms of any statin-related adverse events, and adjust the doses accordingly.

In a healthy volunteer crossover study (N = 10), coadministration of a single 20 mg dose of simvastatin at the end of a 14-day regimen with 120 mg BID diltiazem SR resulted in a 5-fold increase in mean simvastatin AUC versus simvastatin alone. Subjects with increased average steady-state exposures of diltiazem showed a greater fold increase in simvastatin exposure. Computer-based simulations showed that at a daily dose of 480 mg of diltiazem, an 8- to 9-fold mean increase in simvastatin AUC can be expected. If coadministration of simvastatin with diltiazem is required, limit the daily doses of simvastatin to 10 mg and diltiazem to 240 mg.

In a ten-subject randomized, open-label, 4-way crossover study, coadministration of diltiazem (120 mg BID diltiazem SR for 2 weeks) with a single 20 mg dose of lovastatin resulted in 3- to 4-fold increase in mean lovastatin AUC and Cmaxversus lovastatin alone. In the same study, there was no significant change in 20 mg single dose pravastatin AUC and Cmaxduring diltiazem coadministration. Diltiazem plasma levels were not significantly affected by lovastatin or pravastatin.

Alcohol: Alcohol increases the rate at which diltiazem hydrochloride CD releases diltiazem in vitro. This effect may lead to more rapid absorption and an increase in the systemic exposure of diltiazem, and associated dose-related adverse reactions. Avoid consumption of alcohol with diltiazem hydrochloride CD (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY).

### Rhabdomyolysis with concurrent atorvastatin and diltiazem [^a5fddc3f]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To report a case of rhabdomyolysis and acute hepatitis associated with the coadministration of atorvastatin and diltiazem.

Case Summary

A 60-year-old African American man with a significant past medical history presented to the emergency department with acute renal failure secondary to rhabdomyolysis. In addition, liver enzymes were elevated to greater than 3 times normal. The only change in medication was the initiation of diltiazem 3 weeks earlier for atrial fibrillation to a complicated medication regimen that included atorvastatin.

Discussion

Rhabdomyolysis has been reported in patients receiving hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors when coadministered with agents that may inhibit their metabolism. Atorvastatin is the most potent of this class of agents currently available and is commonly used in the treatment of hyperlipidemia. Rhabdomyolysis resulting from the drug interaction between diltiazem and other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors has been described in the literature. However, no report has specifically associated this adverse event with atorvastatin and diltiazem. We describe a patient with a complex medication regimen who was admitted for rhabdomyolysis and accompanying acute renal failure, along with acute hepatitis, thought to be secondary to a drug interaction between atorvastatin and diltiazem.

Conclusions

While optimizing the patient's lipid profile should be the primary factor in choosing one statin over another, the potential for drug interactions requires close attention. All patients beginning HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor therapy should be counseled regarding the signs and symptoms of muscle injury; particular attention should be paid to those patients who are taking medications that may interact.

### Diltiazem hydrochloride (DILTIAZEM HYDROCHLORIDE in SODIUM CHLORIDE) [^ddaf4197]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Statins: Diltiazem has been shown to increase the AUC of some statins. The risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis with statins metabolized by CYP3A4 may be increased with concomitant use of diltiazem [see Drug Interactions (7)].

Coadministration of a simvastatin with 120 mg BID diltiazem SR resulted in 5 times the mean simvastatin AUC versus simvastatin alone. Higher doses of diltiazem are likely to be worse.

Coadministration of a lovastatin with 120 mg BID diltiazem SR resulted in a 3 to 4 times the mean lovastatin AUC and Cmaxversus lovastatin alone. In the same study, there was no significant change in AUC and Cmaxof 20 mg single dose pravastatin during diltiazem coadministration. Diltiazem plasma levels were not significantly affected by lovastatin or pravastatin.

Effect of Other Drugs on Diltiazem:

CYP3A4 Inhibitors and Inducers

Cimetidine and Ranitidine: Coadministration with cimetidine increased Cmaxof diltiazem by 58% and AUC by 53%. Ranitidine produced smaller, non-significant increases. The effect may be mediated by cimetidine's known inhibition of hepatic CYP3A, the enzyme system responsible for the first-pass metabolism of diltiazem [see Drug Interactions (7)].

Rifampin: Coadministration of rifampin with diltiazem lowered the diltiazem plasma concentrations to undetectable levels [see Drug Interactions (7)].

---

### Trandolapril and verapamil hydrochloride (tarka) [^9a876634]. FDA (2012). Low credibility.

Concomitant Diuretic Therapy

Trandolapril Component

As with other ACE inhibitors, patients on diuretics, especially those on recently instituted diuretic therapy, may occasionally experience an excessive reduction of blood pressure after initiation of therapy with TARKA. The possibility of exacerbation of hypotensive effects with TARKA may be minimized by either discontinuing the diuretic or cautiously increasing salt intake prior to initiation of treatment with TARKA. If it is not possible to discontinue the diuretic, the starting dose of TARKA should be reduced (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). No clinically significant pharmacokinetic interaction has been found between trandolapril (or its metabolites) and furosemide.

Agents Increasing Serum Potassium

Trandolapril Component

Trandolapril can attenuate potassium loss caused by thiazide diuretics and increase serum potassium when used alone. Use of potassium-sparing diuretics (spironolactone, triamterene, or amiloride), potassium supplements, or potassium-containing salt substitutes concomitantly with ACE inhibitors can increase the risk of hyperkalemia. If concomitant use of such agents is indicated, they should be used with caution and with appropriate monitoring of serum potassium (see PRECAUTIONS).

HMG-CoA Reductase Inhibitors ("Statins")

Verapamil component

The use of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors that are CYP3A4 substrates in combination with verapamil has been associated with reports of myopathy/rhabdomyolysis.

Co-administration of multiple doses of 10 mg of verapamil with 80 mg simvastatin resulted in exposure to simvastatin 2.5-fold that following simvastatin alone. Limit the dose of simvastatin in patients on verapamil to 10 mg daily. Limit the daily dose of lovastatin to 40 mg. Lower starting and maintenance doses of other CYP3A4 substrates (e.g., atorvastatin) may be required as verapamil may increase the plasma concentration of these drugs.

Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents including Selective Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitors (COX-2 Inhibitors)

Trandolapril component

In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, co-administration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with ACE inhibitors, including trandolapril, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving trandolapril and NSAID therapy.

The antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors, including trandolapril may be attenuated by NSAIDs.

### Simvastatin (Zocor) [^32238d25]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Risk Factors for Myopathy

Risk factors for myopathy include age 65 years or greater, uncontrolled hypothyroidism, renal impairment, concomitant use with certain other drugs (including other lipid-lowering therapies), and higher ZOCOR dosage; Chinese patients on ZOCOR may be at higher risk for myopathy [see Contraindications (4), Drug Interactions (7.1), and Use in Specific Populations (8.8)]. The risk of myopathy is increased by elevated plasma levels of simvastatin and simvastatin acid. The risk is also greater in patients taking an 80 mg daily dosage of ZOCOR compared with patients taking lower ZOCOR dosages and compared with patients using other statins with similar or greater LDL-C-lowering efficacy [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

Steps to Prevent or Reduce the Risk of Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis

The concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors with ZOCOR is contraindicated. If short-term treatment with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors is required, temporarily suspend ZOCOR during the duration of strong CYP3A4 inhibitor treatment. The concomitant use of ZOCOR with gemfibrozil, cyclosporine, or danazol is also contraindicated [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7.1)].

ZOCOR dosage modifications are recommended for patients taking lomitapide, verapamil, diltiazem, dronedarone, amiodarone, amlodipine or ranolazine [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)]. ZOCOR use should be temporarily suspended in patients taking daptomycin. Lipid modifying doses (≥ 1 gram/day) of niacin, fibrates, colchicine, and grapefruit juice may also increase the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Table 16. Pharmacokinetic drug–drug interactions with antihypertensive medications — Absorption interactions include potassium binder (patiromer) decreasing absorption of antihypertensives leading to reduced BP-lowering effects, with mitigation by administering antihypertensives at least 3 h before or after the binder. Metabolism interactions include CYP3A4 inhibitors increasing nondihydropyridine concentration with enhanced clinical effects and CYP3A4 inducers decreasing nondihydropyridine CCB concentration with reduced clinical effects. With CYP3A4 inhibition via amlodipine, verapamil, or diltiazem or other CYP3A4 inhibitors, eplerenone has increased risk of hypotension and hyperkalemia and a lowered dose when combined with diltiazem could be considered a productive interaction. Elimination and transporter interactions include thiazide-type diuretics or RAS blockers reducing lithium clearance with increased lithium toxicity risk, and reduced P-gp efflux of dabigatran increasing dabigatran levels with a higher risk of bleeding.

### Recommendations for management of clinically significant drug-drug interactions with statins and select agents used in patients with cardiovascular disease: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^984bceeb]. Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Amlodipine — interactions with simvastatin and atorvastatin and safety context are as follows: Coadministration of multiple doses of 10 mg amlodipine with 80 mg simvastatin resulted in a 77% increase in exposure to simvastatin compared with simvastatin alone, whereas coadministration of amlodipine with 80 mg atorvastatin resulted in no significant change in the steady-state pharmacokinetic parameters of atorvastatin; in the ALLHAT-LLT trial 1122 patients (21.7%) took amlodipine in combination with pravastatin, and no incidence of muscle-related toxicity was reported, and the FDA-approved product labeling for amlodipine indicates that there may be an increased risk of muscle-related toxicity when combined with simvastatin.

DDIs involving P-gp — P-gp, also known as multidrug resistance-1, belongs to a superfamily of membrane-associated ATP-binding cassette transporters and uses ATP to actively pump substrates across the membrane to the extracellular space, often against a concentration gradient; it is localized primarily in the gastrointestinal tract and in hepatic, renal, and brain tissue where it plays a critical role in drug disposition, preventing oral absorption by secreting substrates into the intestinal lumen, promoting secretion into the urine and bile, and maintaining the blood-brain barrier; interactions can be classified as inhibitor or induction, with competitive inhibition the most common mechanism, where inhibition in the gastrointestinal tract increases bioavailability, inhibition in hepatic and renal tissue reduces drug elimination, inhibition in the brain enhances central nervous system penetration, and induction most commonly involves enhanced gene expression with many of the same transcription factors that upregulate CYP450 enzymes also enhancing P-gp expression.

### Prognostic factors for colchicine prophylaxis-related adverse events when initiating allopurinol for gout: retrospective cohort study [^955fd9d7]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This is the first large observational study to investigate prognostic factors for adverse events related to colchicine prophylaxis when initiating allopurinol for gout. Using UK primary care data linked to hospital admission records, we were able to capture rare but potentially serious side effects. We found that females were more likely to develop diarrhoea and nausea/vomiting. Older age was linked to a greater risk of diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting, and myocardial infarction. A quarter of people with gout taking colchicine prophylaxis were already prescribed a medication with the potential to interact with colchicine. In the majority of cases, this was a statin (mainly simvastatin or atorvastatin). Whilst there were some associations of medicines and some adverse outcomes, there were no associations between statins and any adverse outcomes except for atorvastatin with MI. Significant increases in the risk of diarrhoea were seen with amiodarone, fibrates and macrolide antibiotics, neuropathy with diltiazem, bone marrow suppression with fibrates and ketoconazole, myalgia with amiodarone, fibrates and verapamil, and MI with diltiazem and macrolides. A higher comorbidity index was associated with a significantly increased risk of diarrhoea and MI. CKD was significantly associated with an increased risk of MI.

Concomitant Medication Prescription

Table 2 summarizes concomitant use of an NOAC with different interacting medications. The most commonly prescribed medications with possible drug‐drug interaction with an NOAC were atorvastatin (26.4%), digoxin (19.0%), diltiazem (14.4%), and amiodarone (13.9%). The remaining medications were concomitantly prescribed to < 10% of patients, including dronedarone (2.00%), verapamil (0.80%), clarithromycin (1.25%), erythromycin (0.11%), fluconazole (0.36%), other azoles (0.49%), and antidepressants (7.60%). β‐Blockers (37.3%) and flecainide (0.85%) were included as control, with baseline characteristics summarized in Table S2. Overall, β‐blocker users were younger, had higher rate of concomitant cardiovascular risk factors and diseases, and had higher CHA 2 DS 2 ‐VASc score. Flecainide users were more likely younger, had better renal function, had less heart failure, and had lower CHA 2 DS 2 ‐VASc score. Characteristics of patients taking clarithromycin and fluconazole were similarly summarized in Table S2. Patients who took clarithromycin were more likely to be men and had higher proportion of diabetes. Patients who were prescribed fluconazole had higher proportion of heart failure and worse renal function (Table S2).

Adverse Clinical Outcomes

The analyzed patients were followed up for a total of 40 317 patient‐years, including 18 735 patient‐years for apixaban, 13 936 for dabigatran, 1092 for edoxaban, and 6554 for rivaroxaban. Table 3 summarizes the proportion of patients who experienced the prespecified adverse events. Adjusted HR was calculated after adjusting for sex, age, estimated glomerular filtration rate, hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, ischemic heart disease, heart failure, stroke, CHA 2 DS 2 ‐VASc score, antiplatelet, and NSAIDs.

Results

Baseline

Our study cohort included 16 717 valid subjects, with mean age of 60.5 years (± 12.0 years, 58.9 [± 12.6] in men and 62.9 [± 11.2] in women, P < 0.001), and about 52.1% of them were men (Table 1). At baseline, 18.6% of the cohort was current smoker, and 24.4% reported regular physical activity. More than half of the cohort was hypertensive, and about one out of four had type 2 diabetes mellitus. Overall, 38.0% of subjects had a previous cardiovascular event. Pretreatment mean LDL‐C levels were 191.7 (± 54.6) mg dL −1 [5.0 (± 1.4) mmol L −1], whilst mean levels reported during statin treatment were 111.1 (± 38.3) mg dL −1 [2.9 (± 1.0) mmol L −1]. Simvastatin and atorvastatin were the most commonly prescribed statins (31.9% and 31.8%, respectively) (see Table 1). A concomitant nonstatin lipid‐lowering drug was prescribed to 25.3% of patients. In particular, ezetimibe and omega‐3 fatty acids were the most prescribed lipid‐lowering therapies (55.3% and 43.6%, respectively), whilst fibrates were prescribed in 10.7% of the cohort. The concomitant use of potential interacting drugs involved 6.5% of patients; amlodipine, diltiazem and amiodarone being the most frequently reported drugs.

DISCUSSION

We demonstrate in this study higher risk of bleeding in DOAC‐treated patients, associated with concomitant use of verapamil or amiodarone. Risk was apparent specifically for dabigatran‐verapamil, dabigatran‐amiodarone, and rivaroxaban‐amiodarone combinations. A slightly increased risk was associated also with bisoprolol and a trend (which was not statistically significant) for an increased risk associated with clarithromycin. In addition, we have shown, for the first time in a population‐based study, significantly higher risk for CVA or systemic embolism in patients with AF, anticoagulated with DOACs that were concomitantly using phenytoin, carbamazepine, valproic acid, or levetiracetam.

The three DOACs differ in their elimination from the body. Clearance of dabigatran is only 20% by nonrenal pathways,(consisting of direct intestinal excretion and metabolism by CYP enzymes); nonrenal clearance of rivaroxaban is reported to be 65%; and apixaban nonrenal metabolism reports are between < 50%and 73%. In rivaroxaban and apixaban, CYP3A4 contributes 18% and 25% of the hepatic elimination, respectively. Dabigatran is not metabolized by CYP3A4. Efflux of all three DOACs was strongly inhibited in vitro in the presence of P‐gp inhibitors. Phase I studies reported pharmacokinetic drug‐drug interactions mediated by P‐gp alone for dabigatran; and interactions mediated by P‐gp with CYP3A4 enzymes for rivaroxaban and apixaban. Verapamil, and ketoconazole (P‐gp/CYP3A4 inhibitors) increased dabigatran exposure by up to 2.5‐fold, and amiodarone (mainly P‐gp inhibitor) increased exposure of dabigatran 1.6‐fold; clarithromycin, ketoconazole (P‐gp/CYP3A4 inhibitors), and ritonavir (which is mainly CYP3A4 inhibitor) increased exposure of rivaroxaban by 54%, 158%, and 153%, respectively. Apixaban exposure increased by 99% with co‐administration of ketoconazole, and by 40% with diltiazem (CYP3A4 inhibitor).

Drug Interactions with DOACs

All four DOACs undergo direct intestinal excretion mediated by the permeability glycoprotein (P-gp) transporter. Coadministration of DOACs with potent P-gp modifiers will cause either increased (inhibitors) or inadequate exposure (inducers). P-gp inhibitors like ketoconazole, erythromycin, quinidine, verapamil, and amiodarone increased the area under plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) and maximum plasma concentration (C max) of edoxaban by 33–77% and 65–104%, respectively. The PK analysis of the RE-LY trial showed that coadministration of verapamil, amiodarone, and diltiazem increased steady state exposure of dabigatran by 23, 12, and 8.4%, respectively. Finally, apixaban and rivaroxaban undergo significant metabolism by cytochrome P450 (CYP3A4) and are thus additionally affected by CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers (Table 1).

A detailed review on drug interactions with DOACs is beyond the scope of this review. Use of DOACs is associated with fewer clinically relevant drug interactions than warfarin. The most important drug interactions are listed below. Dronedarone, an antiarrhythmic agent, is a potent inhibitor of P-gp and CYP3A4. Coadministration with dabigatran is associated with a 2-fold increase in dabigatran AUC and a modest increase in the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. Dabigatran AUC increases by 143% when administered within 2 h with an immediate release formulation of verapamil. Among antiplatelet agents, ticagrelor is the only one with P-gp inhibitory action and increases the exposure of dabigatran by 50%. Rifampicin is one of the most potent inducers of P-gp and CYP3A4, and coadministration can lead to therapeutic failure with all DOACs with the exception of edoxaban that shows a compensatory increase of its active metabolites M4 and M6. Antiepileptic agents such as phenytoin, phenobarbital, and carbamazepine are also potent inducers of P-gp and CYP3A4, and their use is contraindicated in association with DOACs. Valproic acid (mild P-gp inhibitor) and levetiracetam (no effect on P-gp) can be safely administered. HIV protease inhibitors boosted with ritonavir or cobicistat are potent inhibitors of P-gp and CYP3A4 and their use is contraindicated with DOACs.

Drug and gene interactions

In the interaction cohort (n = 652), the overall numbers of different drug substrates, inhibitors, and inducers considered were 199, 109, and 27, respectively. Twenty-four drugs with an associated pharmacogenomic guideline were prescribed in the interaction cohort, 17 of which contributed to ≥ 1 observed DGI (Additional file 5). The genes with DGIs were as follows: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A5, SLCO1B1, and VKORC1.

Overall, 882 interactions in 503 (77.1%) patients were identified, whilst 346 substantial interactions occurred in 252 (38.7%) patients (Fig. 4 a). Almost half (45.0%) of all interactions were DDIs with 41.2% DGIs, 12.7% DDGIs, and 1.1% DGGIs. For substantial interactions, 59.2% were DDIs, 11.6% DGIs, 26.3% DDGIs, and 2.9% DGGIs. The observed DGGIs were due to either warfarin/ CYP2C9 / VKORC1 or amitriptyline/ CYP2D6 / CYP2C19 interactions. A complete breakdown of all and substantial interactions is in Additional files 8 and 9, respectively.

This figure shows the total number (%) of interactions identified (a), the number (%) of interactions per patient (b), and the percentage of interactions mediated per enzyme/transporter (c) in 652 post-NSTE-ACS patients. The pie charts on the left display all interactions (of any or unconfirmed strength), whilst predicted substantial interactions only are presented in the charts on the right. In a and b, each interaction was counted only once. In c, some types of interaction were counted more than once in a given patient. These were as follows: DDIs where a perpetrator drug can influence the same victim drug through more than one enzyme/transporter (e.g. verapamil inhibiting atorvastatin at both CYP3A4/5 and P-gp), DDGIs involving more than one enzyme/transporter, and DGGIs. These interactions were included in the count of both involved enzymes/transporters to illustrate them clearly in c only

### Guidance for incorporating FDA processes into the ACC / AHA clinical practice guideline methodology: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^ebdf88ad]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Antihypertensive medications — pharmacokinetic drug–drug interactions are detailed across absorption, metabolism, elimination, and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) effects, with specific mitigation where stated. Potassium binder (patiromer) decreases absorption of multiple antihypertensives and to mitigate this, administer the antihypertensives at least 3 h before or after taking the potassium binder. Potassium binder (sodium zirconium cyclosilicate) increases absorption of furosemide with increased clinical effects (eg, diuresis or risk of hypokalemia); the effect is diminished with separation of administration by 2 h. Iron salts decrease absorption of methyldopa leading to reduced BP lowering. CYP2D6 inhibitors increase BB concentration with enhanced clinical effects (eg, hypotension and bradycardia), and CYP3A4 inhibitors increase nondihydropyridine concentration (diltiazem, verapamil) with enhanced clinical effects. CYP3A4 inhibition via amlodipine, verapamil, or diltiazem increases calcineurin inhibitor (tacrolimus, cyclosporine) concentration with increased risk for side effects (eg, renal impairment). With eplerenone plus diltiazem there is increased risk of hypotension and hyperkalemia, and using a lower dose of eplerenone when combined with diltiazem could be considered a productive interaction. Lithium clearance is reduced by thiazide-type diuretics and RAS blockers, increasing lithium toxicity risk. Verapamil via P-gp inhibition increases dabigatran levels with a higher risk of bleeding, and verapamil or carvedilol via P-gp inhibition increases digoxin levels with a higher risk of digoxin toxicity.

Use In Pregnancy

CLARITHROMYCIN SHOULD NOT BE USED IN PREGNANT WOMEN EXCEPT IN CLINICAL CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE NO ALTERNATIVE THERAPY IS APPROPRIATE. IF PREGNANCY OCCURS WHILE TAKING THIS DRUG, THE PATIENT SHOULD BE APPRISED OF THE POTENTIAL HAZARD TO THE FETUS. CLARITHROMYCIN HAS DEMONSTRATED ADVERSE EFFECTS OF PREGNANCY OUTCOME AND/OR EMBRYO-FETAL DEVELOPMENT IN MONKEYS, RATS, MICE, AND RABBITS AT DOSES THAT PRODUCED PLASMA LEVELS 2 TO 17 TIMES THE SERUM LEVELS ACHIEVED IN HUMANS TREATED AT THE MAXIMUM RECOMMENDED HUMAN DOSES. (See PRECAUTIONS - Pregnancy .)

Hepatotoxicity

Hepatic dysfunction, including increased liver enzymes, and hepatocellular and/or cholestatic hepatitis, with or without jaundice, has been reported with clarithromycin. This hepatic dysfunction may be severe and is usually reversible. In some instances, hepatic failure with fatal outcome has been reported and generally has been associated with serious underlying diseases and/or concomitant medications. Discontinue clarithromycin immediately if signs and symptoms of hepatitis occur.

Drug Interactions

Serious adverse reactions have been reported in patients taking clarithromycin concomitantly with CYP3A4 substrates. These include colchicine toxicity with colchicine; rhabdomyolysis with simvastatin, lovastatin, and atorvastatin; and hypotension with calcium channel blockers metabolized by CYP3A4 (e.g., verapamil, amlodipine, diltiazem) (see CONTRAINDICATIONS and PRECAUTIONS – Drug Interactions).

Life-threatening and fatal drug interactions have been reported in patients treated with clarithromycin and colchicine. Clarithromycin is a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor and this interaction may occur while using both drugs at their recommended doses. If co-administration of clarithromycin and colchicine is necessary in patients with normal renal and hepatic function, the dose of colchicine should be reduced. Patients should be monitored for clinical symptoms of colchicine toxicity. Concomitant administration of clarithromycin and colchicine is contraindicated in patients with renal or hepatic impairment (see CONTRAINDICATIONS and PRECAUTIONS – Drug Interactions).

Antiplatelet agent ticagrelor — statin pharmacokinetic interactions show that clinical trials with ticagrelor coadministered with either atorvastatin 80 mg daily or simvastatin 80 mg daily found the atorvastatin–ticagrelor combination resulted in a 23% increase in the Cmax of atorvastatin and a 36% increase in the AUC, and these changes were not statistically significant; the combination of simvastatin–ticagrelor resulted in a mean increase in Cmax of simvastatin of 81% and in the AUC of 56% (90% confidence interval, 1.30–1.87), with some subjects having 2- to 3-fold increases in the Cmax and the AUC; the increases in Cmax and the AUC are likely attributable to inhibition of CYP3A4 by ticagrelor, and because of the reliance on CYP3A4 of lovastatin for metabolism that is similar to that of simvastatin, it is likely that significant increases would also be expected with lovastatin.

### Use of real-world claims data to assess the prevalence of concomitant medications to inform drug-drug interaction risk in target patient populations [^aad83fae]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

CYP3A4 inducers all had a very low prevalence in the overall HR+ BC population (< 0.3%). Modafinil was the top CYP3A4 inducer (0.27%, weak inducer), with other prevalent inducers of strong inducers carbamazepine and rifampin and moderate inducer primidone. Modafinil showed enrichment in the subgroup with metastatic disease and had top relevant diagnoses of fatigue and anxiety (Figure 3 c).

Prevalence of CYP3A4 substrates in the overall HR+ BC cohort was generally high (up to 20%); top substrates included midazolam (19.1%), atorvastatin (14.1%), alprazolam (7%), aprepitant (4.7%), simvastatin (3.3%), buspirone (2.3%), budesonide (2.1%), rivaroxaban (1.35%), quetiapine (0.9%), and lovastatin (0.52%). Among subpopulations, midazolam had greater use among the younger and metastatic populations, and the statins (atorvastatin and simvastatin) had greater use among the elderly. Midazolam was primarily administered via injection and used acutely for procedures. Atorvastatin and simvastatin had comorbid indication diagnoses of hyperlipidemia. Alprazolam, buspirone, and quetiapine were utilized chronically, with top diseases related to neurologic and psychiatric diagnoses (Figure 3 d).

The top P‐gp inhibitors in the HR+ BC cohort included ketoconazole (2.1% prevalence in the cohort), erythromycin (1.6%), and cyclosporine (1%) (Figure 3 e). The remaining P‐gp inhibitors (verapamil, amiodarone, ranolazine, propafenone, and dronedarone) have an overall low prevalence, but some enrichment among the elderly subgroup. For the drug route of administration, ketoconazole was primarily administered externally, while erythromycin and cyclosporine were administered ophthalmologically. P‐gp inhibitors tend to be utilized chronically and have cardiovascular‐related disease indications such as atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and atherosclerosis (Figure 3 e). For BCRP inhibitors, cyclosporine was the most prevalent in the HR+ BC cohort (1%), followed by rolapitant (0.07%), an antiemetic for chemotherapy (Figure 3 f).

American Heart Association statin pharmacokinetics — metabolism and excretion considerations note that the primary form of drug metabolism for most statins occurs through cytochrome P450 (CYP450), with the most prevalent enzyme subcategories for statin metabolism being 3A4 and 2C9; simvastatin and lovastatin undergo significant CYP3A4 metabolism, atorvastatin undergoes a lesser amount as one of its minor metabolic pathways, fluvastatin, pitavastatin, and rosuvastatin require CYP2C9, and pravastatin is the only statin that does not undergo CYP450 metabolism. Statins undergo extensive metabolism with a small amount excreted unchanged renally, and the overall dependence of statin metabolites on renal elimination is modest, with pravastatin being the highest at 20% and atorvastatin the lowest at < 2%. Fluvastatin, lovastatin, pravastatin, and simvastatin have a relatively short t1/2 and are optimally dosed in the evening or administered as an extended-release formulation (for fluvastatin or lovastatin), whereas atorvastatin, pitavastatin, and rosuvastatin have longer half-lives and can be dosed at any time of the day. Drug–drug interactions with statins may sometimes be attributable to decreased drug excretion, especially with impaired glomerular filtration rate, and this potential issue is limited with atorvastatin, which has the least amount of renal excretion (< 2%), but may be a consideration for other statins that have a higher degree of renal excretion; similar to CYP450, there are several subtypes of organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATPs) that can affect the elimination of rosuvastatin and pitavastatin.

Valsartan: On average, patients with mild-to-moderate chronic liver disease have twice the exposure (measured by AUC values) to valsartan of healthy volunteers (matched by age, sex and weight). In general, no dosage adjustment is needed in patients with mild-to-moderate liver disease. Care should be exercised in patients with liver disease.

Drug Interactions

Amlodipine

In vitro data in human plasma indicate that amlodipine has no effect on the protein binding of digoxin, phenytoin, warfarin and indomethacin.

Impact of Other Drugs on Amlodipine

Coadministered cimetidine, magnesium-and aluminum hydroxide antacids, sildenafil, and grapefruit juice have no impact on the exposure to amlodipine.

CYP3A Inhibitors: Co-administration of a 180 mg daily dose of diltiazem with 5 mg amlodipine in elderly hypertensive patients resulted in a 60% increase in amlodipine systemic exposure. Erythromycin co-administration in healthy volunteers did not significantly change amlodipine systemic exposure. However, strong inhibitors of CYP3A (e.g., itraconazole, clarithromycin) may increase the plasma concentrations of amlodipine to a greater extent [see Drug Interactions (7)].

Impact of Amlodipine on Other Drugs

Coadministered amlodipine does not affect the exposure to atorvastatin, digoxin, ethanol and the warfarin prothrombin response time.

Asymptomatic low left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and post–myocardial infarction (MI) risk — key evidence and cautions are as follows: The Framingham studies have shown a 60% increased risk of death in patients with asymptomatic low LVEF compared with those with normal LVEF. MADIT-II showed a 31% relative risk reduction in all-cause mortality in patients with post-MI with LVEF ≤ 30% receiving a prophylactic ICD compared with standard of care. For prevention of progression, beta-blocker therapy is recommended to prevent symptomatic HF in patients with reduced LVEF. Regarding comorbid therapy, thiazolidinediones should be avoided in patients with reduced LVEF. Nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers diltiazem and verapamil are myocardial depressants and generally not tolerated in HF, and although not specifically tested in asymptomatic patients with low LVEF, nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers may be harmful in this population because of their negative inotropic effects.

The combination of conivaptan and lovastatin or simvastatin is potentially harmful and should be avoided, whereas atorvastatin, pravastatin, fluvastatin, rosuvastatin, or pitavastatin may be considered when clinically indicated; during conivaptan infusion, either atorvastatin or a statin not metabolized by CYP3A may be considered. Tolvaptan may be used in combination with any statin at any approved doses, and no clinically significant interactions have been noted between tolvaptan and lovastatin.

### Prevalence of drug-drug interactions in older people before and after hospital admission: analysis from the OPERAM trial [^902c80a7]. BMC Geriatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

DDIs are often classified according to their potentially harmful effects, but no study has reported the prevalence of DDIs according to whether or not they may be appropriate. Evaluation of appropriateness of a DDI often requires an individual, case-by-case assessment, which is not possible on a large database. However, from the list of 66 DDIs, some can be considered inappropriate in many cases ("avoid concurrent use"), such as DDI 32, "beta-blocker and verapamil or diltiazem" (potentially serious cardiovascular adverse effects in particular in patients predisposed to heart failure); DDI 36, "concomitant use of ≥ 3 centrally-acting drugs" (increased risk of falls, fracture, impaired cognition); and DDI 63, "tamoxifen and paroxetine or fluoxetine or bupropion" (risk of sudden death – ventricular arrhythmias, torsade de pointes). Most drugs in these DDI categories were rarely prescribed in our cohort with the exception of DDI 36. Other DDIs may be appropriate, or even intentional, in some cases if preventive measures are taken (e.g. dose adaptation, close monitoring, patient education), for example, for DDI 12, "oral anticoagulant and antiplatelet drug"; DDI 65, "concomitant prescription of ≥ 2 drugs that reduce potassium"; and DDI 66: "selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor and loop or thiazide diuretic". DDI 65 prescribed in acute clinical situations, such as cardiac failure or COPD exacerbation, may, for example, be appropriate if serum potassium concentrations are monitored closely. Similarly, DDI 12 is only appropriate in certain specific clinical situations (e.g. atrial fibrillation and recent acute coronary syndrome) and for a fixed duration. The fact that 57% of patients in the experimental arm (i.e. patients for whom medication review was performed by a physician and pharmacist) had at least one DDI at hospital discharge suggests that most of these DDIs were considered appropriate in these patients and thus did not require drug discontinuation or modification after the medication review. Only the patients in the control arm had an increase in the prevalence of DDI 36 from baseline to discharge, which may explain why there was a significant increase in the prevalence of DDIs during hospitalization only in patients in the control arm. These data suggest that frequent medication reviews for those admitted to hospital, not only during hospital admission, but also after discharge, can contribute to reducing the risk of inappropriate DDIs.

### Recommendations for management of clinically significant drug-drug interactions with statins and select agents used in patients with cardiovascular disease: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^71d6799f]. Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Colchicine–statin interactions — mechanistic considerations: Interactions between colchicine and statins that undergo several different metabolic pathways have been described in the literature, suggesting that the underlying cause is likely multifactorial. Colchicine undergoes hepatic demethylation by CYP3A4 and does not appear to impair CYP3A4 activity; thus, the drug–drug interaction between colchicine and statins is likely attributable to competitive inhibition, which may result in increased concentrations of both substrates. Additionally, colchicine is a substrate for P-gp, and colchicine likely competes for P-gp–mediated efflux, resulting in accumulation of both substrates in myocytes and other target cells.

### Amlodipine besylate and valsartan (Exforge) [^f5c3c01d]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Valsartan: On average, patients with mild-to-moderate chronic liver disease have twice the exposure (measured by AUC values) to valsartan of healthy volunteers (matched by age, sex and weight). In general, no dosage adjustment is needed in patients with mild-to-moderate liver disease. Care should be exercised in patients with liver disease.

Drug Interactions

Amlodipine

In vitro data in human plasma indicate that amlodipine has no effect on the protein binding of digoxin, phenytoin, warfarin and indomethacin.

Impact of Other Drugs on Amlodipine

Coadministered cimetidine, magnesium-and aluminum hydroxide antacids, sildenafil, and grapefruit juice have no impact on the exposure to amlodipine.

CYP3A Inhibitors: Co-administration of a 180 mg daily dose of diltiazem with 5 mg amlodipine in elderly hypertensive patients resulted in a 60% increase in amlodipine systemic exposure. Erythromycin co-administration in healthy volunteers did not significantly change amlodipine systemic exposure. However, strong inhibitors of CYP3A (e.g., itraconazole, clarithromycin) may increase the plasma concentrations of amlodipine to a greater extent [see Drug Interactions (7)].

Impact of Amlodipine on Other Drugs

Coadministered amlodipine does not affect the exposure to atorvastatin, digoxin, ethanol and the warfarin prothrombin response time.

### Recommendations for management of clinically significant drug-drug interactions with statins and select agents used in patients with cardiovascular disease: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^1fedcdbd]. Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Overview of DDIs, cytochrome P-450 enzymes, and permeability glycoprotein — The 2 most common pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions (DDIs) involving statins are those mediated by the cytochrome P-450 (CYP450) enzyme system and permeability glycoprotein (P-gp). All DDIs can result in altered low-density lipoprotein cholesterol reductions or an enhanced risk of muscle-related toxicity. In CYP450 nomenclature, enzymes sharing ≥ 40% similarity are categorized into families and those sharing ≥ 55% similarity are further classified into subfamilies. Although > 50 different CYP450 enzymes have been isolated in humans, only a select few (CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, and CYP3A5) are responsible for metabolizing the majority of available medications; of these, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4 play a substantial role in statin metabolism, and CYP2C8 plays a minor role. DDIs via the CYP450 system are generally classified as inhibition or induction; enzyme inhibition produces increased serum concentrations of interacting medications, whereas the peak effect of induction is often delayed for days to weeks. Inducers of the CYP450 enzyme system are less common, and none of the medications included in this review have been associated with CYP450 enzyme induction.

### Lansoprazole, amoxicillin, clarithromycin [^628ca15c]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

 Drug Interactions

Serious adverse reactions have been reported in patients taking clarithromycin concomitantly with CYP3A4 substrates. These include colchicine toxicity with colchicine; rhabdomyolysis with simvastatin, lovastatin, and atorvastatin; hypoglycemia with disopyramide, toxicity with lurasidone, and hypotension and acute kidney injury with calcium channel blockers metabolized by CYP3A4 (e.g., verapamil, amlodipine, diltiazem, nifedipine). Most reports of acute kidney injury with calcium channel blockers metabolized by CYP3A4 involved elderly patients 65 years of age or older (see CONTRAINDICATIONS and PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions). Clarithromycin should be used with caution when administered concurrently with medications that induce the cytochrome CYP3A4 enzyme (see PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions).

Colchicine

Life-threatening and fatal drug interactions have been reported in patients treated with clarithromycin and colchicine. Clarithromycin is a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor and this interaction may occur while using both drugs at their recommended doses. If coadministration of clarithromycin and colchicine is necessary in patients with normal renal and hepatic function, the dose of colchicine should be reduced. Patients should be monitored for clinical symptoms of colchicine toxicity. Concomitant administration of clarithromycin and colchicine is contraindicated in patients with renal or hepatic impairment (see CONTRAINDICATIONS and PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions).

Benzodiazepines

Increased sedation and prolongation of sedation have been reported with concomitant administration of clarithromycin and triazolobenzodiazepines, such as triazolam, and midazolam.

### A clinician's guide to statin drug-drug interactions [^529f46d0]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2014). Low credibility.

The statins are widely used worldwide to reduce risk for cardiovascular events in both the primary and secondary prevention settings. Although generally quite safe, the statins can be associated with a variety of serious side adverse effects, including myalgia, myopathy, and changes in plasma enzymes of hepatic origin. Although rare, the most serious of these is rhabdomyolysis. Several drugs can interfere with the metabolism and disposal of the statins, thereby increasing risk for adverse events. It is important that clinicians treating patients with statins be aware of the potential for drug-drug interactions between each statin and specific other drugs and take measures to prevent them. The prediction of potential drug-drug interactions derives from basic pharmacokinetic principles. Certain drug interactions are predicted by measuring the effect of interacting drugs on blood plasma concentrations of the statin. Individual patient variations resulting in part from polymorphisms in the metabolizing enzymes confound some of these predictions. Based on these known effects, a new classification for predicting statin drug interactions is proposed. This report discusses likely prescription and nonprescription interactions as well as potential alternatives for special populations.

### Clinical conundrums involving statin drug-drug interactions [^86e5e9ba]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Statins are the cornerstone of pharmacologic therapy for the prevention and treatment of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. While they are generally considered safe, statins can be affected by drug-drug interactions (DDIs) that increase their systemic exposure increasing the risk for statin-associated muscle symptoms. These interactions are primarily mediated through metabolizing enzymes such as cytochrome P450 isoenzymes and membrane-bound drug transporting proteins including P-glycoprotein and organic ion transporting polypeptide. Recognition and avoidance of clinically significant statin DDIs is important to ensure their safe use. Conversely, concern over statin DDIs that are not clinically significant may lead to inappropriate underutilization or avoidance of statins in patients who would benefit from them. While many statin DDIs are well-characterized, we present several others that are less-well-established which may warrant clinical attention.

### Amlodipine besylate and atorvastatin calcium (Caduet) [^fd568754]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS

Data from a drug-drug interaction study involving 10 mg of amlodipine and 80 mg of atorvastatin in healthy subjects indicate that the pharmacokinetics of amlodipine are not altered when the drugs are co-administered. The effect of amlodipine on the pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin showed no effect on the Cmax: 91% (90% confidence interval: 80 to 103%), but the AUC of atorvastatin increased by 18% (90% confidence interval: 109 to 127%) in the presence of amlodipine, which is not clinically meaningful.

No drug interaction studies have been conducted with CADUET and other drugs, although studies have been conducted in the individual amlodipine and atorvastatin components, as described below:

7.1	Impact of Other Drugs on Amlodipine

CYP3A Inhibitors

Co-administration with CYP3A inhibitors (moderate and strong) results in increased systemic exposure to amlodipine and may require dose reduction. Monitor for symptoms of hypotension and edema when amlodipine is co-administered with CYP3A inhibitors to determine the need for dose adjustment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

CYP3A Inducers

No information is available on the quantitative effects of CYP3A inducers on amlodipine. Blood pressure should be closely monitored when amlodipine is co-administered with CYP3A inducers.

Sildenafil

Monitor for hypotension when sildenafil is co-administered with amlodipine [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

7.2	Impact of Amlodipine on Other Drugs

Immunosuppressants

Amlodipine may increase the systemic exposure of cyclosporine or tacrolimus when co-administered. Frequent monitoring of trough blood levels of cyclosporine and tacrolimus is recommended and adjust the dose when appropriate [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

7.3	Drug Interactions that may Increase the Risk of Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis with Atorvastatin

Atorvastatin is a substrate of CYP3A4 and transporters (e.g. OATP1B1/1B3, P-gp, or BCRP). Atorvastatin plasma levels can be significantly increased with concomitant administration of inhibitors of CYP3A4 and transporters. Table 3 includes a list of drugs that may increase exposure to atorvastatin and may increase the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis when used concomitantly and instructions for preventing or managing them [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

7.4	Drug Interactions that may Decrease Exposure to Atorvastatin

Table 4 presents drug interactions that may decrease exposure to atorvastatin and instructions for preventing or managing them.

### Recommendations for management of clinically significant drug-drug interactions with statins and select agents used in patients with cardiovascular disease: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^2c883516]. Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Gemfibrozil pharmacology and interaction mechanisms — absorption is rapid after oral administration with nearly 100% bioavailability and peak plasma concentrations within 1 to 2 hours; it is highly protein bound, has an elimination t1/2 of ≈1.5 hours, and is dosed twice daily. Gemfibrozil and particularly its glucuronide metabolite are potent irreversible inhibitors and inactivators of CYP2C8, and both are substrates but not inhibitors of CYP3A4. Gemfibrozil 1-O-β glucuronide and, to a lesser extent, the parent compound also potently inhibit OATP1B1/3-mediated hepatic uptake of statin acids, OATP2B1, Na+-taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide, the renal transporter OAT3, and statin glucuronidation or lactonization; thus, drug–drug interactions in statin–gemfibrozil therapy may vary with susceptibility to intestinal, hepatic, and renal transporter inhibition and CYP450 metabolism.

### Colchicine: the good, the bad, the ugly and how to minimize the risks [^824cbe26]. Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Important drug interactions

Due to the combination of limited oral availability and being a substrate for P-gp and CYP3A4, colchicine is subject to a range of significant drug interactions, especially with P-gp or CYP3A4 inhibitors. Concurrent use of CYP3A4-inhibiting drugs can result in a doubling of colchicine plasma concentration, and the use of P-gp inhibitors may quadruple colchicine concentrations. Considering the low apparent percentage of colchicine that is metabolized by CYP3A4, it is likely that the interactions attributed to CYP3A4 are actually due, at least in part, to P-gp inhibition, as many CYP3A4 inhibitors are also P-gp inhibitors. Interacting drugs include diltiazem, verapamil, amiodarone, itraconazole, ketoconazole, fluconazole, ritonavir, saquinavir, other protease inhibitors, erythromycin, clarithromycin, ciclosporin and telmisartan. Co-administration of verapamil, a potent P-gp and CYP3A4 inhibitor, has been shown to reduce the clearance of colchicine by ≈50%, thereby increasing plasma colchicine concentrations, indicating that the dose of colchicine should be reduced by ≈50% in individuals receiving concomitant verapamil.

### Atrial fibrillation in heart failure: what should we do? [^d06a2e43]. European Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Calcium channel blockers

Non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (verapamil or diltiazem) are not recommended in patients with significantly impaired left ventricular function due to their negative inotropic effects, although specific data are limited. In the Multicenter Diltiazem Postinfarction Trial, patients were randomized to diltiazem or placebo 3–15 days after the onset of myocardial infarction.HF patients, including 490 with evidence of pulmonary congestion, had an increase in the composite of cardiac death or non-fatal re-infarction (HR 1.41, 95% CI 1.01–1.96). In subsequent analysis, diltiazem was found to increase late-onset HF in those with LVEF < 40%. Verapamil did not improve outcomes after myocardial infarction in patients who developed HF in the Danish Verapamil Infarction Trials.

Heart rate targets for atrial fibrillation in the context of heart failure and reduced ejection fraction

Following the publication of the Rate Control Efficacy in Permanent Atrial Fibrillation (RACE II) trial, patients with AF can initially be treated to a more lenient heart rate regime (< 110 beats/min resting heart rate). To summarize, 614 patients with permanent AF were randomized to a heart rate < 80 b.p.m. at rest and < 110 b.p.m. during moderate exercise or lenient control, with results showing a similar rate of composite clinical events in each arm. There were also no differences in functional outcomes, hospital admissions, or symptoms. Fifteen percent of the population had LVEF < 40% but it remains unclear if these targets apply to AF patients with HFrEF. However, these findings are consistent with other results, and would suggest that heart rate in AF is more a marker of disease than a therapeutic target and that a lenient heart rate may be acceptable if symptoms are controlled and tachycardia is avoided. It is worth noting that other guideline recommendations continue to advocate a resting heart rate < 80 b.p.m. in patients with symptomatic AF and left ventricular dysfunction.

Specific rhythm-control strategies

Cardioversion

The first step in rhythm control is the restoration of sinus rhythm, which often requires cardioversion. Urgent cardioversion is recommended in any patient with significant haemodynamic impairment secondary to AF. Elective cardioversion is indicated in individuals with symptomatic persistent AF. Unfortunately, recurrence of AF after successful cardioversion is a frequent problem (∼50% at 6 months), particularly in patients with HF. Over half of inpatients undergoing cardioversion for atrial arrhythmias have HF.

### Atorvastatin calcium [^fbf81137]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Specific Populations

Geriatric

Plasma concentrations of atorvastatin are higher (approximately 40% for Cmaxand 30% for AUC) in healthy elderly subjects (age ≥ 65 years) than in young adults.

Pediatric

Apparent oral clearance of atorvastatin in pediatric subjects appeared similar to that of adults when scaled allometrically by body weight as the body weight was the only significant covariate in atorvastatin population PK model with data including pediatric HeFH patients (ages 10 years to 17 years of age, n = 29) in an open-label, 8-week study.

Gender

Plasma concentrations of atorvastatin in females differ from those in males (approximately 20% higher for Cmaxand 10% lower for AUC); however, there is no clinically significant difference in LDL-C reduction with atorvastatin calcium tablets between males and females.

Renal Impairment

Renal disease has no influence on the plasma concentrations or LDL-C reduction of atorvastatin [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

While studies have not been conducted in patients with end-stage renal disease, hemodialysis is not expected to significantly enhance clearance of atorvastatin since the drug is extensively bound to plasma proteins.

Hepatic Impairment

In patients with chronic alcoholic liver disease, plasma concentrations of atorvastatin are markedly increased. Cmaxand AUC are each 4-fold greater in patients with Childs-Pugh A disease. Cmaxand AUC are approximately 16-fold and 11-fold increased, respectively, in patients with Childs-Pugh B disease [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)].

Drug Interactions

Atorvastatin is a substrate of the hepatic transporters, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 transporter. Metabolites of atorvastatin are substrates of OATP1B1. Atorvastatin is also identified as a substrate of the efflux transporter BCRP, which may limit the intestinal absorption and biliary clearance of atorvastatin.

Atorvastatin calcium tablets had no clinically significant effect on prothrombin time when administered to patients receiving chronic warfarin treatment.

### Dronedarone (Multaq) [^ae179e07]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

7.2 Effects of Other Drugs on Dronedarone

Ketoconazole and Other Potent CYP3A Inhibitors

Concomitant use of ketoconazole as well as other potent CYP3A inhibitors such as itraconazole, voriconazole, ritonavir, clarithromycin, and nefazodone is contraindicated because exposure to dronedarone is significantly increased [see Contraindications (4), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Grapefruit Juice

Patients should avoid grapefruit juice beverages while taking MULTAQ because exposure to dronedarone is significantly increased [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Rifampin and Other CYP3A Inducers

Avoid rifampin or other CYP3A inducers such as phenobarbital, carbamazepine, phenytoin, and St. John's wort because they decrease exposure to dronedarone significantly [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Calcium Channel Blockers

Verapamil and diltiazem are moderate CYP3A inhibitors and increase dronedarone exposure. Give a low dose of calcium channel blockers initially and increase only after ECG verification of good tolerability [see Drug Interactions (7.3), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Simvastatin

Dronedarone increased simvastatin/simvastatin acid exposure. Avoid doses greater than 10 mg once daily of simvastatin [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Other Statins

Because of multiple mechanisms of interaction with statins (CYPs and transporters), follow statin label recommendations for use with CYP3A and P-gp inhibitors such as dronedarone.

Calcium Channel Blockers

Dronedarone increased the exposure of calcium channel blockers (verapamil, diltiazem or nifedipine). Give a low dose of calcium channel blockers initially and increase only after ECG verification of good tolerability [see Drug Interactions (7.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Sirolimus, Tacrolimus, and Other CYP3A Substrates with Narrow Therapeutic Range

Dronedarone can increase plasma concentrations of tacrolimus, sirolimus, and other CYP3A substrates with a narrow therapeutic range when given orally. Monitor plasma concentrations and adjust dosage appropriately.

Beta-Blockers and Other CYP2D6 Substrates

Dronedarone increased the exposure of propranolol and metoprolol. Give low doses of beta-blockers initially, and increase only after ECG verification of good tolerability. Other CYP2D6 substrates, including other beta-blockers, tricyclic antidepressants, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) may have increased exposure upon coadministration with dronedarone [see Drug Interactions (7.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Drug-drug interactions in the management of patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension [^85dfda08]. Chest (2022). Medium credibility.

Vasoreactivity: Calcium Channel Blockers

Approximately 10% of patients with idiopathic or heritable PAH are vasoreactive. This is defined by a reduction in mean pulmonary artery pressure of more than 10 mm Hg to an absolute value of < 40 mm Hg with unchanged or improved cardiac output when exposed to a rapidly active pulmonary vasodilator (inhaled NO or IV epoprostenol) during right heart catheterization. These cases of vasoreactive PAH respond well to high doses of oral calcium channel blockers (CCBs) such as amlodipine, nifedipine, or diltiazem. All CCBs are metabolized by CYP3A4, which introduces opportunity for significant drug interactions if coadministered with other CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers. Verapamil, diltiazem, amlodipine, and nifedipine also are CYP3A4 inhibitors, with verapamil and diltiazem exhibiting more potent inhibition activity. Potent CYP3A4 inhibition by diltiazem and verapamil may increase the plasma concentrations of medications that rely on this enzyme for metabolism. Verapamil has a higher drug interaction risk profile than all the CCBs as a substrate and potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 and inhibitor of P-glycoprotein. The nondihydropyridine CCBs, verapamil and diltiazem, can cause excessive bradycardia. Care should be used when these nondihydropyridine CCBs are coadministered with other medications known to cause bradycardia, including noncardiac medications such as lacosamide for seizures, sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor modulators for multiple sclerosis or ulcerative colitis, and ceritinib for non-small cell lung cancer.

### Recommendations for management of clinically significant drug-drug interactions with statins and select agents used in patients with cardiovascular disease: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^2e3874f9]. Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Gemfibrozil–statin interactions — magnitude by statin and clinical guidance show that gemfibrozil increases the AUC of active simvastatin acid and lovastatin acid by ≈2- to 3-fold, and atorvastatin AUC values are modestly 1.2- to 1.4-fold higher with coadministration. With pravastatin, pravastatin–gemfibrozil increases plasma pravastatin concentrations by 202% (range, 40%–412%) and reduces renal clearance from 25 to 14 L/h (P < 0.0001). Rosuvastatin concentrations increase by ≈1.56- to 1.88-fold. Pitavastatin shows only a modest effect, with an increase of 45% in the AUC in 24 subjects. Despite potent inhibition of fluvastatin transport in hepatocytes, in at least 1 study of 17 subjects there was no significant difference in AUC and Cmax versus gemfibrozil alone. The 2013 ACC/AHA guideline states that combination therapy with any statin and gemfibrozil should be avoided due to increased risk for muscle-related toxicity.

### Recommendations for management of clinically significant drug-drug interactions with statins and select agents used in patients with cardiovascular disease: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^cdd73bd6]. Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Antiarrhythmic agents — amiodarone and dronedarone with statins — carry specific coadministration limits and conditional allowances. Combination therapy with rosuvastatin, atorvastatin, pitavastatin, fluvastatin, or pravastatin and amiodarone is reasonable. When combined with amiodarone, the dose of lovastatin should not exceed 40 mg daily and the dose of simvastatin should not exceed 20 mg daily, and higher doses of lovastatin and simvastatin may be considered if clinically indicated with close monitoring for muscle-related toxicity. In patients already stable on lovastatin 80 mg daily or simvastatin ≥ 40 mg daily with amiodarone, continuation without dose modifications is reasonable. For dronedarone, dronedarone significantly increases systemic exposure of both the prodrug simvastatin and the active metabolite simvastatin acid, therefore the dose of simvastatin should be limited to 10 mg daily, dronedarone may also increase the exposure of lovastatin within the same range as simvastatin, and there are no clinically significant interactions between dronedarone and other statins, and these combinations are reasonable.
