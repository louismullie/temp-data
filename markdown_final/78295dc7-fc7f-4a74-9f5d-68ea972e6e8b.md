## Question

I thought xa was not reliable when monitoring doac itnerfernece ith heparin drip

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether anti-Xa is reliable for monitoring a heparin drip when a patient is on a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the assay mechanics for unfractionated heparin (UFH) and how anti-Xa is normally used. Then, I should consider how different DOAC classes (factor Xa inhibitors versus direct thrombin inhibitor) interfere with anti-Xa assays. Next, I will examine practical strategies when transitioning from a DOAC to UFH, including alternative monitoring options and timing considerations. Finally, I will synthesize a pragmatic, safety-focused recommendation and confirm any exceptions, particularly for dabigatran versus factor Xa inhibitors.

> Let me first confirm the baseline: UFH potentiates antithrombin to inhibit factor Xa (and thrombin), and anti-Xa chromogenic assays are widely used to titrate UFH because they tend to be more analytically specific and less variable than aPTT in many settings, although aPTT and anti-Xa can be discordant in critical illness and certain coagulopathies [^111fkeuW] [^113LgbKA] [^115ztVDf].

> Wait, let me verify the interference issue: oral factor Xa inhibitors (apixaban, rivaroxaban, edoxaban, betrixaban) will also inhibit the exogenous factor Xa in the UFH-calibrated anti-Xa assay, so the assay "sees" both UFH and the DOAC, leading to a falsely elevated apparent UFH activity and risking underdosing of heparin if interpreted at face value [^1135Ub2N] [^114QQJ1w]. In fact, UFH-calibrated anti-Xa levels correlate strongly with rivaroxaban exposure, underscoring that the assay is sensitive to the DOAC signal itself, not just heparin, which is precisely why it becomes unreliable for UFH titration during overlap or recent ingestion of a factor Xa inhibitor [^1159KEEs] [^113J99rt].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — does this apply to dabigatran as well? I need to check the class-specific effects. Dabigatran is a direct thrombin (IIa) inhibitor and does not inhibit factor Xa, so it should not artifactually elevate a UFH anti-Xa level; conversely, dabigatran can prolong aPTT and thrombin-based assays. Thus, anti-Xa monitoring of UFH remains valid in patients on dabigatran, whereas aPTT can be misleading in that scenario [^112D7yyn] [^113d2qCu] [^112Fp2To].

> Next, I should review what to do during transitions from oral factor Xa inhibitors to UFH. Institutional and society guidance has adapted by temporarily avoiding UFH anti-Xa monitoring and using aPTT to titrate UFH until the DOAC is cleared or at least at trough/low levels, precisely to bypass the false elevation in the anti-Xa assay caused by residual oral Xa inhibitor [^1135Ub2N] [^115N8JMF]. I should double-check the timing: residual DOAC effect depends on last dose and renal/hepatic function; many use a pragmatic threshold of < 30 ng/mL as "safe-for-procedure" and a marker of minimal interference, which often requires 24–48 hours off-drug, longer with renal impairment, although exact cutoffs vary by agent and assay availability [^116gToSn] [^114Ugkb3] [^114cfZ9K].

> I will now examine alternatives that mitigate interference when anti-Xa cannot be trusted. One approach is to use an anti-factor IIa UFH assay for patients transitioning from apixaban or rivaroxaban; this thrombin-based UFH method quantified heparin accurately despite clinically meaningful concentrations of oral factor Xa inhibitors and reduced spurious "critical" UFH levels in practice, supporting its use where available [^1146zZ3B]. Another approach is laboratory DOAC neutralization (e.g., activated charcoal devices such as DOAC-Stop), which can remove factor Xa inhibitors from plasma before performing hemostasis assays; while validated most robustly for lupus anticoagulant workflows, this strategy is increasingly recommended by expert groups to mitigate DOAC interference in coagulation testing, including algorithms for UFH monitoring during transitions, with local validation essential before clinical adoption [^115C1MzV] [^116y8xzW] [^114QQJ1w].

> But wait, what if calibrated DOAC assays are available? Let me consider that. When drug-specific anti-Xa calibrations are on hand, labs can rapidly quantify apixaban/rivaroxaban/edoxaban levels; if levels are negligible, one could resume standard UFH anti-Xa monitoring without confounding, whereas detectable levels confirm the need to avoid anti-Xa for heparin titration until clearance is adequate. Universal LMWH-calibrated anti-Xa methods also correlate strongly with DOAC concentrations and can provide timely categorical cutoffs, but they cannot distinguish heparin from DOAC and should not be used to guide UFH dosing during overlap [^113J99rt] [^117VQfjQ] [^11678fbM].

> Let me reconsider potential pitfalls. aPTT itself can be unreliable in certain states and shows only moderate agreement with anti-Xa in the ICU, so clinical context and parallel safety checks are required; however, during the presence of an oral factor Xa inhibitor, aPTT remains the lesser of two evils for UFH titration because anti-Xa is systematically biased upward by the DOAC, whereas aPTT is far less sensitive to factor Xa inhibitors and therefore less likely to drive inappropriate UFH dose reductions [^113LgbKA] [^113pprTM] [^1135Ub2N].

> In summary, I should confirm the bottom line clearly: UFH anti-Xa is not reliable for heparin drip monitoring when a factor Xa inhibitor DOAC is on board or recently taken due to positive analytical interference that falsely elevates "heparin levels"; use aPTT or an anti-IIa UFH assay and consider DOAC-neutralization or drug-level testing until the DOAC effect has waned. An important exception is dabigatran, where anti-Xa remains appropriate for UFH monitoring because dabigatran does not interfere with factor Xa–based assays, though aPTT may be prolonged by dabigatran itself [^1135Ub2N] [^114QQJ1w] [^112D7yyn].

---

Correct — anti-Xa assays are not reliable for monitoring heparin infusions when DOACs are present [^115N8JMF] because DOACs cause **falsely elevated anti-Xa levels** [^1146zZ3B] that can lead to underdosing and thrombosis [^1135Ub2N]. Use aPTT or ACT [^1135Ub2N] for UFH monitoring until the DOAC is cleared, and consider DOAC-neutralizing agents [^116y8xzW] or drug-specific assays [^116gToSn] if available [^114QQJ1w].

---

## Mechanism of interference

Mechanistically, **direct factor Xa inhibitors** (apixaban, rivaroxaban, edoxaban) inhibit factor Xa — the same target measured by anti-Xa assays [^112Fp2To] — yielding falsely elevated anti-Xa activity even in the absence of heparin [^1146zZ3B]. This **false elevation** can produce critically high anti-Xa results [^1135Ub2N], prompting inappropriate heparin dose reductions or discontinuation and increasing thrombotic risk [^115N8JMF].

---

## Clinical evidence of interference

- **Clinical evidence**: A study evaluating an anti-factor IIa assay for UFH monitoring showed that anti-Xa assays produced falsely elevated results in patients recently transitioned from DOACs to UFH, confounding dosing decisions [^1146zZ3B].

- **Reduction in false highs**: Implementing an anti-IIa assay reduced critically high anti-Xa results from 9.4% to 3.8% in patients recently discontinuing DOACs [^1146zZ3B].

- **ISTH guidance**: The ISTH Subcommittee on Control of Anticoagulation highlights the risk of interference from prior DOAC therapy when switching to UFH, potentially leading to inappropriate anticoagulation management [^115N8JMF].

---

## Clinical implications of interference

Falsely elevated anti-Xa levels from DOAC interference can cause **underdosing of heparin** [^115N8JMF] and **increase thrombotic risk** [^1146zZ3B]. Conversely, underestimation of residual DOAC can prompt excessive heparin dosing and bleeding [^114QQJ1w]. Overall, this interference promotes **misinterpretation of anticoagulation intensity** and inappropriate management decisions with adverse outcomes [^1135Ub2N].

---

## Alternative monitoring strategies

Given the **unreliability of anti-Xa assays** in the presence of DOACs, **alternative monitoring strategies** are recommended:

- **Activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT)**: aPTT is less affected by DOACs and can be used as an alternative for UFH monitoring [^1135Ub2N].

- **Activated clotting time (ACT)**: ACT is another alternative, particularly in critical care settings [^112Eqh9H].

- **DOAC-neutralizing agents**: Agents such as DOAC-Stop can be used to neutralize DOACs in vitro, allowing accurate heparin monitoring [^116y8xzW].

- **Drug-specific assays**: If available, drug-specific assays calibrated for the specific DOAC can provide accurate measurements [^116gToSn] [^113J99rt].

---

## Recommendations for clinical practice

- **Avoid anti-Xa assays**: Do not rely on anti-Xa assays for heparin monitoring in patients recently exposed to DOACs [^115N8JMF].

- **Use alternatives**: Use aPTT or ACT for UFH monitoring until the DOAC is cleared from the patient's system [^1135Ub2N].

- **Neutralize DOACs**: Consider using DOAC-neutralizing agents or drug-specific assays if available [^115C1MzV] [^116y8xzW].

- **Educate clinicians**: Ensure clinicians are aware of the potential for DOAC interference in anti-Xa assays and the importance of alternative monitoring strategies [^114QQJ1w] [^112qMxuu].

---

Anti-Xa assays are unreliable for monitoring heparin infusions in patients recently exposed to DOACs [^115N8JMF] due to **falsely elevated anti-Xa levels**. Alternative monitoring strategies such as aPTT, ACT, and DOAC-neutralizing agents should be used to ensure accurate anticoagulation management [^1135Ub2N].

### Direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) interference in hemostasis assays [^114QQJ1w]. Hematology. American Society of Hematology Education Program (2021). Low credibility.

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are a group of direct coagulation factor inhibitors, including both direct thrombin inhibitors and direct factor Xa inhibitors. These medications may cause hemostasis assay interference by falsely increasing or decreasing measured values, depending on the analyte. Considering the potential for DOAC interference in a variety of hemostasis assays is essential to avoid erroneous interpretation of results.

Preanalytic strategies to avoid DOAC interference include selecting alternatives to clot-based hemostasis assays in patients taking DOACs when possible and sample collection timed when the patient is off anticoagulant therapy or at the expected drug trough. Clinical laboratories may also provide educational materials that clearly describe possible interferences from DOAC, develop testing algorithms to aid in detection of DOAC in submitted samples, use DOAC-neutralizing agents to remove DOACs before continuing with testing, and write interpretive comments that explain the effects of DOAC interference in hemostasis tests. Using a combination of the described strategies will aid physicians and laboratorians in correctly interpreting hemostasis and thrombosis laboratory tests in the presence of DOACs.

### Anti-factor IIa (FIIa) heparin assay for patients on direct factor Xa (FXa) inhibitors [^1146zZ3B]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2020). Low credibility.

Direct factor Xa (FXa) inhibitors are increasingly prescribed for outpatients, and those transitioning to unfractionated heparin (UFH) for hospital admission are monitored via an anti-FXa assay. Because of assay interference, UFH results would often be critically elevated, confounding dosing.

- **Objectives**: An anti-factor IIa (FIIa) UFH assay was evaluated for clinical use.

- **Methods**: The BIOPHEN ANTI-IIa (Aniara Diagnostica) assay and anti-FXa INNOVANCE Heparin assay (Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics Products GmbH) were compared on the Siemens BCS XP system. Samples included UFH controls and calibrators and specimens from patients transitioning from apixaban or rivaroxaban to UFH. Method comparison, linearity, recovery, precision, and interference by direct FXa inhibitors were evaluated. The effect of the BIOPHEN ANTI-IIa assay on the rate of critically high UFH results was retrospectively reviewed 4 months after implementation.

- **Results**: Accuracy studies using 0.24 and 0.50 IU/mL UFH yielded means and standard deviations of 0.26 ± 0.01 and 0.58 ± 0.01 IU/mL, respectively. Within-run and between-run coefficients of variation were 4.6% and 15.5% for the low control, and 1.8% and 10.6% for the high control. The method comparison slope was 0.9965 (r² = 0.9468). The linear range was 0.1 to 1.3 IU/mL. The assay measured UFH in the presence of 192 ng/mL apixaban or 158 ng/mL rivaroxaban. The introduction of the assay for clinical use reduced the monthly percentage of critically high results from 9.4% to 3.8% for admitted heparinized patients who recently discontinued apixaban.

### Using direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) in cancer and other high-risk populations [^115wL7is]. Hematology. American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2015). Low credibility.

The major practical advantage of the direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), which include the thrombin inhibitor dabigatran and the factor Xa inhibitors apixaban, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban, compared to vitamin K antagonists, is their fixed dosing that does not require laboratory monitoring. With the recent and rapid introduction of DOACs for the treatment of acute venous thromboembolism (VTE), clinicians now face various questions regarding the efficacy and safety of these compounds overall and in specific high-risk populations. The collective evidence from six large clinical trials involving 27,000 patients has demonstrated that DOACs are as effective as vitamin K antagonists (VKA) in preventing recurrent VTE while being associated with a significantly lower risk of major bleeding. These findings are consistent in subgroups of patients with pulmonary embolism, the elderly, and those with a high body weight or moderate renal insufficiency, making these agents suitable for a broad spectrum of patients with VTE. DOACs are also an attractive treatment option for patients with VTE and concomitant cancer, thrombotic antiphospholipid syndrome, or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. However, currently available clinical data is insufficient to make evidence-based recommendations on the use of DOACs in these settings. Several studies evaluating the efficacy and safety of DOACs in these high-risk populations are underway.

Regarding the medical management of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), particularly in the context of initiating non-heparin anticoagulants for HIT without thrombosis, the ASH 2018 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) when selecting a non-heparin anticoagulant for patients with acute isolated HIT.

### Agreement between activated partial thromboplastin time and anti-Xa activity in critically ill patients receiving therapeutic unfractionated heparin [^113LgbKA]. Thrombosis Research (2019). Low credibility.

No study supports the use of either aPTT or anti-Xa activity for heparin monitoring in critical care patients. There is a lack of strong data on the agreement between aPTT and anti-Xa. The aims of this study were to:

1. Analyze the agreement between aPTT and anti-Xa in a large population of critically ill patients under unfractionated heparin therapy (UFH).
2. Identify clinical and biological factors associated with agreement or disagreement.
3. Analyze the impact of anti-Xa availability on the use of aPTT and UFH therapy.

- **Methods**: Retrospective study in a 35-bed mixed-ICU population between 2006 and 2016 at a university teaching hospital.

- **Inclusion criteria**: Delivery of a UFH dose > 15,000 U/24 h during at least one day with one anti-Xa determination.

- **Data**: Demographic variables, aPTT, anti-Xa, laboratory variables, and presence of extracorporeal devices (ECD). Pairs of simultaneously dosed aPTT and anti-Xa [aPTT:anti-Xa] were analyzed based on their agreement within the sub-therapeutic, therapeutic (aPTT 50–80″, anti-Xa 0.3–0.7 U/ml), or supra-therapeutic ranges.

- **Results**: 2283 patient admissions (2085 patients) were analyzed. A total of 35,595 [aPTT:anti-Xa] pairs were found. The overall [aPTT:anti-Xa] agreement was 59.6% and was lowest (54.3%) in the presence of ECD compared to non-ECD patients (61.6%; p < 0.001). Sixteen demographic and biological variables were analyzed and were not predictive of [aPTT:anti-Xa] agreement. No significant difference in administered UFH dose was observed after anti-Xa introduction.

### Coagulation assessment with the new generation of oral anticoagulants [^113d2qCu]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Determining anticoagulation levels with the NOACs can be challenging due to the sensitivity of various tests. Assays that respond to NOACs are significant in clinical practice. The thrombin time test is too sensitive to provide interpretable information with dabigatran. As a result, a diluted thrombin time test (dTT) has been developed and calibrated specifically for dabigatran. This dTT assay, which has been approved for clinical use in several countries (though not yet in the United States), along with the ecarin clotting time (ECT), are two commercially available assays responsive to dabigatran within its therapeutic range.

- **Assays and testing methodologies**: Either dTT or ECT, but not the INR, can be used to evaluate coagulation activity in patients on dabigatran. At peak therapeutic plasma concentrations of dabigatran, the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) is increased to two to three times the control values. Conversely, at trough concentrations (e.g. 12 hours after the last dose), it decreases to approximately 1.3 times the control values. However, due to the plateauing effect of aPTT prolongation at therapeutic dabigatran concentrations, aPTT only provides an approximate assessment of dabigatran's effect on coagulation.

- **Utility of ECT and dTT assays**: The ECT and dTT assays offer a linear response to plasma dabigatran across its therapeutic range, making them more useful for monitoring purposes. The ECT is used clinically under an FDA Humanitarian Exemption for monitoring anticoagulation with the parenteral direct thrombin inhibitor, hirudin, in patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass who have heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. However, it is not yet available in a form calibrated specifically for dabigatran.

### Laboratory measurement of the direct oral anticoagulants [^111WocP4]. British Journal of Haematology (2016). Low credibility.

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), including the direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran and the direct factor Xa (FXa) inhibitors rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban, are approved for thromboembolism prevention and treatment. These drugs do not require routine coagulation monitoring; however, in certain circumstances, measurement of drug level or anticoagulant effect may be necessary.

Traditional coagulation tests, despite lacking analytical sensitivity and specificity, are widely available and inexpensive. They can provide useful information regarding the residual anticoagulant effect of DOACs. Hemoclot® and ecarin-based assays can be used to quantify dabigatran levels, and calibrated chromogenic anti-FXa assays are suitable for measuring levels of rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban, but these tests are not yet widely available.

### A universal anti-xa assay for rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban measurements: method validation, diagnostic accuracy and external validation [^113J99rt]. British Journal of Haematology (2021). High credibility.

A total of 932 patients were included in nine study centers. In all, 35 patients were excluded because of heparin use, two were excluded because more than one DOAC was used, five were excluded due to pre-analytical issues, and 23 were excluded due to insufficient sample material. Thus, 867 patients were eventually available for analysis. Among those, 375 patients were taking rivaroxaban, 426 apixaban, and 66 edoxaban. The median [interquartile range (IQR)] age was 76 (66–82) years and 42.8% of the patients were female. Rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban drug levels were evenly distributed over the full range of measurements.

- **Measurements of the assay**: A universal, low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH)-calibrated anti-Xa assay was conducted in relation to drug concentrations in a multicenter cross-sectional study practiced with 867 patients. Drug concentrations were determined using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Of the patients, 375 were taking rivaroxaban, 426 apixaban, and 66 edoxaban. The Spearman correlation coefficient was 0.99 for rivaroxaban (95% CI 0.98–0.99), 0.97 for apixaban (95% CI 0.96–0.97), and 0.98 for edoxaban (95% CI 0.95–0.99).

- **Diagnostic accuracy**: The association between measurements of the LMWH-calibrated anti-Xa assay and drug concentrations showed high correlation. The Spearman correlation coefficient rₛ was 0.99 for rivaroxaban (95% CI 0.98–0.99), 0.97 for apixaban (95% CI 0.96–0.97), and 0.98 for edoxaban (95% CI 0.95–0.99). Below 50 µg/l, the Spearman correlation coefficient was 0.90 (95% CI 0.88–0.93).

### The myths behind DOAC measurement: Analyses of prescribing information from different regulatory bodies and a call for harmonization [^117Mc6JC]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2022). Low credibility.

Laboratories in Canada, the UK, Australasia, and Europe have demonstrated that these tests are easily implementable and show adequate analytical and clinical performance according to their regional regulations. These tests are helpful for clinicians, as demonstrated by numerous studies from these parts of the globe. In the United States, there is no need to wait for FDA approval of DOAC-dedicated methods to develop these methods because almost all laboratories have the minimum material requirements for performing these analyses. In centers dealing with DOAC reversal agents, offering these product-dedicated methods may even be extremely cost-effective because it may help rationalize the administration of andexanet alfa or idarucizumab for direct factor Xa inhibitors and dabigatran, respectively.

Use of DOACs is ever-expanding, with DOAC prescriptions now exceeding those of other anticoagulants, including VKAs, in some regions. As this use increases, the likely need to measure DOAC exposure will also increase. Measurement of DOACs does not represent any technical difficulty. The fact that these laboratory tests are not available in some locations suggests disparities in patient care, and we suggest it is time to address such disparities.

### A universal anti-xa assay for rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban measurements: method validation, diagnostic accuracy and external validation [^115qH1qn]. British Journal of Haematology (2021). Low credibility.

Our present study's strength is that we have conducted a comprehensive set of evaluation studies that were carefully designed, thus clarifying all essential questions associated with the implementation. In particular, the cross-sectional study was prospectively designed and conducted in a multicentre design, including many patients. LC-MS/MS was utilised in all patients as the most valid reference standard. Moreover, a clinical practice rather than an artificial study setting was chosen. External validation was done as well, confirming the potential application of the specific cut-offs to other laboratories.

The present study has several potential limitations.

- **Edoxaban availability**: First, edoxaban was not studied in the spiking experiments and the retrospective analysis because it was not yet available in Switzerland at the time of these experiments. As long as the accuracy of the measurements was equivalent to rivaroxaban and apixaban in the cross-sectional study and the external validation, we believe that findings inferred from spiking experiments and retrospective analysis can be extrapolated to edoxaban as well.
- **Limited edoxaban usage**: Second, the number of patients taking edoxaban was limited because of its limited use in Switzerland. However, we estimate the risk of bias as low because the accuracy measures are consistent between drugs and in the external validation study.
- **Single assay evaluation**: Third, one particular LMWH-calibrated assay was studied, and it might be possible that other anti-Xa assays behave differently. Thus, these results cannot straightforwardly be applied to other LMWH-calibrated anti-Xa assays.

### Limitations of specific coagulation tests for direct oral anticoagulants: A critical analysis [^117CHYff]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

During treatment with direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC), coagulation assessment is required before thrombolysis, surgery, and if anticoagulation reversal is evaluated. Limited data support the accuracy of DOAC-specific coagulation assays around the safe-for-treatment threshold of 30 ng/mL.

- **Methods and results**: In 481 samples obtained from 96 patients enrolled at a single center, DOAC concentrations were measured using Hemoclot direct thrombin inhibitor assay, Biophen direct thrombin inhibitor assay, or ecarin clotting time for dabigatran; chromogenic anti-Xa assay (AXA) for factor Xa inhibitors (rivaroxaban, apixaban); and ultraperformance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry as reference. All dabigatran-specific assays had high sensitivity to concentrations > 30 ng/mL. However, specificity was lower for Hemoclot direct thrombin inhibitor assay (78.2%) than for Biophen direct thrombin inhibitor assay (98.9%) and ecarin clotting time (94.6%). AXA provided high sensitivity and specificity for rivaroxaban but low sensitivity for apixaban (73.8%); concentrations up to 82 ng/mL were misclassified as < 30 ng/mL. If no DOAC-specific calibration for AXA is available, results two-fold above the upper limit of normal indicate relevant rivaroxaban concentrations. For apixaban, all elevated results should raise suspicion of relevant anticoagulation.

- **Conclusions**: DOAC-specific tests differ considerably in diagnostic performance for concentrations close to the currently accepted safe-for-treatment threshold. Compared with Biophen direct thrombin inhibitor assay, these measures indicate varied diagnostic reliability and accuracy.

### The myths behind DOAC measurement: Analyses of prescribing information from different regulatory bodies and a call for harmonization [^114nSyx3]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2022). Low credibility.

It is unclear whether the information in drug prescribing information (PI), or the lack thereof, represents a driver for clinicians to seek DOAC measurements. As previously noted, the decision for a clinical laboratory to implement new testing may be predicated on numerous factors. For anticoagulation monitoring, the PI, sometimes referred to as drug labeling, may provide details about pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and the impact on laboratory tests. It may also indicate whether monitoring is required or if other precautions are necessary, but likely, the clinical laboratory will respond to local clinicians' needs. As seen with the Lovenox PI, when the PI started providing indications for drug monitoring, specifically anti-FXa activity, and guidance documents reported the same, an increasing number of laboratories began reporting these assays.

There is a noted regional difference in DOAC testing availability for clinicians, and this availability may be linked to regional DOAC PI. One indicator of testing availability in a given region is assessing External Quality Assurance (EQA) programs. EQA programs are laboratory quality tools that ensure the local laboratory meets performance expectations when testing blinded samples containing particular analytes. Locally reported results are compared with peer groups. EQA programs detail the number of enrolled participants, the test methodology used, and the statistical thresholds for performance — either acceptability (pass) or not (fail). When comparing the enrolled participants for DOAC measurements, US laboratories are lagging behind their Australian, Canadian, and European counterparts.

### Progress in the monitoring of direct oral anticoagulant therapy [^1155agDb]. British Journal of Haematology (2019). Low credibility.

The availability of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) has led to a paradigm shift in the field of anticoagulation, with DOACs increasingly being prescribed for patients in preference to vitamin K antagonists and low molecular weight heparin. Despite good experience with the use of these agents at fixed doses, there are clinical scenarios where monitoring is recommended. Data from phase III studies of the DOACs and small real-world studies suggest a relationship between DOAC concentration and clinical events.

The DOACs have differing impacts on the common tests of haemostasis, and it is important that clinicians are familiar with the sensitivity of the reagents used in their laboratory to individual DOACs. The specific DOAC drug concentrations can be assayed in the laboratory, when required, to guide appropriate clinical decision-making. Studies from the real world with sufficient numbers evaluating the association of DOAC concentrations with outcomes should be a research priority in order to understand if we could do better through dose individualization.

### DOACs: Role of anti-Xa and drug level monitoring [^114cfZ9K]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology Education Program (2024). Low credibility.

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) do not require routine monitoring of anticoagulant effect. However, measuring DOAC activity may be desirable in specific circumstances to detect whether clinically significant DOAC levels are present, such as prior to urgent surgery. It may also be useful to assess whether drug levels are excessively high or low in at-risk patients, for example, after malabsorptive gastrointestinal surgery.

Routine coagulation tests, including the international normalized ratio (INR) or activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), cannot accurately quantify drug levels. They may provide a qualitative assessment of DOAC activity when considering the estimated time to drug clearance based on timing of the last drug ingestion and renal and hepatic function. Drug-specific chromogenic and clot-based assays can quantify drug levels, but they are not universally available and do not have established therapeutic ranges.

In this review, we discuss our approach to measuring DOAC drug levels, including patient selection, interpretation of coagulation testing, and how measurement may inform clinical decision-making in specific scenarios.

### The myths behind DOAC measurement: Analyses of prescribing information from different regulatory bodies and a call for harmonization [^112qMxuu]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2022). Low credibility.

A specific focus of this manuscript is the consideration of whether and when a laboratory should provide services for patients receiving anticoagulation therapy that do not require routine monitoring. For decades, unfractionated heparin (UFH) infusions have been monitored, with dose adjustments based on the reported activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) and in some institutions, the anti-FXa activity. Likewise, vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) have been monitored using the prothrombin time (PT)/International Normalized Ratio (INR) for nearly 30 years in the United States and longer elsewhere. Daily VKA dose adjustments were primarily based on the patient's INR result, though dietary intake and other factors were also considered.

When low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) became available for clinical use in 1993 in the United States, the drug prescribing information indicated, "There is usually no need for daily monitoring of the effect of Lovenox in patients with normal presurgical coagulation parameters". However, more recent enoxaparin labeling includes pharmacokinetic (drug level) data and suggests that monitoring of anti-FXa may be warranted in certain populations, including those with renal insufficiency, abnormal laboratory coagulation results, or bleeding. When LMWH anticoagulation became available for the pediatric population, guidance suggesting the use of anti-factor Xa (FXa) monitoring and dose adjustment algorithms soon followed.

Today, the clinical laboratory faces a familiar dilemma with direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), which include the direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran.

### A universal anti-xa assay for rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban measurements: Method validation, diagnostic accuracy and external validation [^115DVXBF]. British Journal of Haematology (2021). Low credibility.

Concluding from the two pilot studies and previous research, we selected the Biophen® Heparin LRT with LMWH calibrators. This assay is implemented in many Swiss institutions for the determination of LMWH drug levels. All analyses were conducted in batches on an Atellica COAG 360 analyser (Siemens Healthineers). A five-step calibration curve with the following concentrations of LMWH was applied: 0.0, 0.42, 0.86, 1.26, and 1.67 iu/ml (Biophen® Heparin Calibrator). Samples were rapidly thawed and gently mixed at 37°C. The patient's plasma was pre-diluted (1/2; 100 µl) and added to the solution containing the chromogenic substrate (250 µl). After incubation at 37°C, factor Xa (250 µl) was added. The reaction was stopped after 120 seconds, and the absorption was measured at 405 nm. All instructions of the manufacturers were strictly followed. Following these instructions, the maximum level was 3.34 iu/ml. Clinical information and reference standard test results were not available to the performer of the anti-Xa assay.

### Accuracy and consistency of anti-Xa activity measurement for determination of rivaroxaban plasma levels [^1171Xh7G]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2017). Low credibility.

Accurate determination of anticoagulant plasma concentration is important in clinical practice. We studied the accuracy and consistency of anti-Xa assays for rivaroxaban in a multicenter study. In a range between 50 and 200 μg L^-1, anti-Xa activity correlated well with plasma concentrations. The clinical value might be limited by overestimation and intra- and inter-individual variation.

- **Summary**: Determining the plasma level of direct oral anticoagulants reliably is important in the work-up of complex clinical situations.

- **Objectives**: To study the accuracy and consistency of anti-Xa assays for rivaroxaban plasma concentration in a prospective, multicenter evaluation study employing different reagents and analytical platforms.

- **Methods**: Rivaroxaban 20 mg was administered once daily to 20 healthy volunteers, and blood samples were taken at peak and trough levels (clinicaltrials.gov NCT01710267). Anti-Xa activity was determined in 10 major laboratories using different reagents and analyzers; corresponding rivaroxaban plasma concentrations were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS).

- **Findings**: Overall Pearson's correlation coefficient of anti-Xa levels and HPLC-MS results was 0.99 for Biophen® Heparin (95% CI, 0.99, 0.99), Biophen® DiXaI (95% CI, 0.99, 0.99), and STA® anti-Xa liquid (95% CI, 0.99, 1.00). Correlation was lower in rivaroxaban concentrations below 50 μg L⁻¹ and above 200 μg L⁻¹. The overall bias of the Bland-Altman difference plot was 14.7 μg L⁻¹ for Biophen Heparin, 17.9 μg L⁻¹ for Biophen DiXaI.

### The relationship between DOAC levels and clinical outcomes: The measures tell the tale [^1113EGUa]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2020). Low credibility.

Second, to find the optimal dose-effect for DOACs, we need to further optimize and standardize laboratory tests. These DOAC-specific drug level tests (i.e. thrombin generation assays, ROTEM, and anti-Xa assays for the inhibitors and diluted thrombin time for dabigatran) are becoming increasingly available in hospitals. Currently, available tests are mostly performed in plasma or whole blood. New point-of-care tests that are being developed for DOAC level or activity measurements may be useful, but there are still many uncertainties about the associations of these tests with drug intake and if blood and urine levels correlate.

Third, we need to know if risk models for thromboembolism and major bleeding, such as HAS-BLED and CHA₂DS₂-VASc, can be further improved by adding anticoagulation levels to the prediction scores. This includes predicting the risk not only in a landmark analysis (i.e. around the time of diagnosis of atrial fibrillation or venous thromboembolism) but also through time (i.e. dynamic prediction). Studies that can investigate whether DOAC-specific measurements, either taken once or over time, correspond with the risk of bleeding or thromboembolism could be performed by conducting large prospective studies or using available data from existing data (such as trials and registry data where patients on DOACs have been tested on DOAC plasma levels). In case there is an optimal target and subsequent dose for DOAC in patient populations or subgroups, the final step would be to set up endpoint studies to guide dose regimen selection or DOAC titration in clinical trials.

### A retrospective study of indications and consequences of monitoring direct oral anticoagulant plasma concentrations on patient care in a university hospital: The Retro-AOD study [^114Ugkb3]. Thrombosis Research (2021). Low credibility.

Use of direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) is increasing. Specific concentrations are available and have been proven to be reliable and reproducible in optimizing patient care. This retrospective, monocentric study aimed to describe the indications and consequences of monitoring DOAC plasma levels on patient care.

- **Materials and methods**: We collected data of patients hospitalized at the Bordeaux University Hospital between January 2017 and December 2018. These included demographics, indications, type, dose of DOAC, standard coagulation tests, creatinine clearance, and DOAC plasma concentration using specifically calibrated rivaroxaban and apixaban anti-Xa, and dabigatran anti-IIa assays. The date of the last DOAC intake and the time between intake and plasma level measurement were also collected and analyzed.

- **Results**: A total of 2197 DOAC assays in 1488 patients were obtained in various clinical situations: urgent or elective procedures, context of acute renal failure, suspicion or occurrence of ischemic strokes, intracranial and other bleeding sites. Interpretation of these assays led physicians to maintain, postpone, or cancel invasive and high hemorrhagic risk procedures in 757, 261, and 56 cases respectively. The remaining 1123 assays were associated with no significant modification of patient care. DOAC plasma concentration was ≤ 30 ng/ml (sensitivity 85.4%, specificity 73.6%, positive predictive value 71.1%, negative predictive value 86.7%, AUC 0.81) following a last intake of at least two days.

- **Conclusions**: Our study is, at the time of writing, the largest report of real-life.

### How to deal with interference on heparin anti-Xa activity caused by oral factor FXa inhibitors: Communication from the ISTH SSC subcommittee on control of anticoagulation [^115N8JMF]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2025). Low credibility.

Monitoring unfractionated heparin (UFH) to ensure effective anticoagulation may be performed using anti-factor Xa activity (anti-Xa) instead of the activated partial thromboplastin time. However, in patients who have been treated with oral factor (F)Xa inhibitors (apixaban, rivaroxaban, and edoxaban) while switching to UFH therapy, there is a risk that these oral anti-FXa drugs could interfere with UFH-calibrated anti-Xa monitoring. This may lead to inappropriate anticoagulation management.

This report of the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) Subcommittee on Control of Anticoagulation summarizes the evidence on the risk of interference from previous treatment with oral FXa inhibitors and UFH anti-Xa after heparin initiation. This communication provides pragmatic recommendations for UFH initiation and management with anti-Xa monitoring after switching from oral FXa inhibitors.

### Conversion from activated clotting time to anti-Xa heparin activity assay for heparin monitoring during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation [^112Eqh9H]. Critical Care Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to analyze anticoagulation with unfractionated heparin, which remains the most common therapy to prevent circuit thrombosis during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. However, no consensus exists on the optimal method or targets for heparin monitoring. From 2015 to 2018, the hospital switched from monitoring heparin during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation using activated clotting times to anti-Xa heparin activity assays. This study describes the transition and the associated clinical changes.

- **Design**: Retrospective analysis at a single institution.

- **Setting**: Referral children's hospital.

- **Patients**: A total of 145 pediatric patients over 152 extracorporeal membrane oxygenation runs using 206 extracorporeal membrane oxygenation circuits.

- **Interventions**: Anticoagulation protocol quality improvement.

- **Measurements and main results**: From 2015 to 2018, heparin monitoring during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation changed from hourly activated clotting time to anti-Xa heparin activity assay every 6 hours. This change was associated with a 75% reduction in the circuit changes per extracorporeal membrane oxygenation day. Over the 4 years, patients with an average anti-Xa heparin activity assay of at least 0.25 U/mL showed a 59% reduction in circuit changes per day compared to those with less than 0.15 U/mL. Additionally, anti-Xa heparin activity assay monitoring was associated with a reduction in heparin dose changes per day from 11 ± 4 to 2 ± 1 (p < 0.001).

### Reversal of direct oral anticoagulants: a practical approach [^112RpQYV]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology Education Program (2016). Low credibility.

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have at least noninferior efficacy compared with other oral anticoagulants and offer ancillary benefits, including an overall better safety profile, lack of need for routine monitoring, rapid onset of action, and ease of administration. Reversal of these agents may be indicated in certain situations such as severe bleeding and perioperative management.

DOAC-associated bleeding should be risk stratified: patients with moderate or severe bleeding should have the DOAC discontinued, and reversal strategies should be considered. Laboratory testing has limited utility in the acute management of bleeding; thrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time may be useful for excluding clinically relevant levels of dabigatran. Prothrombin time is potentially useful for rivaroxaban and edoxaban, but calibrated anti-Xa assays are optimal for determining clinically relevant levels of factor Xa inhibitors.

Because specific reversal agents are not widely available, supportive care and interventions for local hemostasis remain the cornerstones of therapy in patients with DOAC-associated bleeding. Nonspecific reversal agents should be considered only in the event of severe bleeding due to their unknown efficacy and associated risks of thrombosis. Recent results from phase 3/4 studies demonstrate efficacy for an antidote to dabigatran (idarucizumab, a monoclonal antibody fragment with specificity for dabigatran) and an antidote to factor Xa inhibitors (andexanet alfa, a recombinant and inactive form of factor Xa that binds inhibitors).

### Monitoring and reversal of direct oral anticoagulants [^112D7yyn]. Hematology. American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2015). Low credibility.

Although the direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) do not require routine monitoring and reduce bleeding compared with warfarin, there are special circumstances in which laboratory measurement or reversal of their anticoagulant effect may be indicated.

- **Quantification assays**: The dilute thrombin time and ecarin-based assays are able to quantify dabigatran across a broad range of concentrations but are not widely available. A normal thrombin time excludes clinically relevant levels, and a normal activated partial thromboplastin time probably excludes excess levels of dabigatran. Factor Xa inhibitors may be quantified with an anti-Xa assay calibrated with drug-specific standards. A normal prothrombin time probably excludes excess levels of rivaroxaban and edoxaban, but not apixaban.

- **Treatment for DOAC-associated bleeding**: Patients with minor and moderate DOAC-associated bleeding can be treated with supportive care and general hemostatic measures. Nonspecific reversal agents (e.g. prothrombin complex concentrate, activated prothrombin complex concentrate) are of unproven benefit, carry a risk of thrombosis, and should be reserved for severe bleeding. Specific reversal agents, such as idarucizumab (a monoclonal antibody fragment that binds dabigatran) as well as andexanet alfa (a recombinant factor Xa variant that binds factor Xa inhibitors but lacks coagulant activity), are in clinical development.

### Limitations of specific coagulation tests for direct oral anticoagulants: A critical analysis [^116Mi1EH]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Our study evaluated the performance of DOAC-specific coagulation assays in real-life patient samples. Different from prior reports, our analyses focused on the diagnostic accuracy of the assays in the low concentration spectrum and their ability to discriminate between concentrations above and below the currently accepted safe-for-treatment threshold of 30 ng/mL.

Previous publications by our group provided evidence that unspecific point-of-care tests and laboratory-based assays can help to identify intact hemostatic function in patients presumably on DOAC treatment. However, the diagnostic performance of these unspecific tests is far from ideal, as only a limited fraction of patients with DOAC concentrations below 30 ng/mL could be detected. Our present analysis investigated guideline-recommended DOAC-specific tests that should theoretically provide better diagnostic accuracy.

In clinical practice, the question of whether it is safe to proceed with treatments that require intact hemostasis (e.g. surgery with high bleeding risk or thrombolysis for acute ischemic stroke) is frequently encountered. Similar concerns arise when reversal therapy is evaluated in DOAC-associated bleeding. Unnecessary reversal therapy comes at considerable financial cost in the case of dabigatran, as idarucizumab is a safe yet expensive therapeutic option. The situation is even more complicated for FXa inhibitors, where prothrombin complex concentrate remains the mainstay of reversal therapy. Prothrombin complex concentrate increases the risk of thrombotic events.

### Can an anti-Xa assay for unfractionated heparin be used to assess the presence of rivaroxaban in critical situations [^1159KEEs]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2020). Low credibility.

Although rivaroxaban has recently become widely used for thrombosis treatment, clinicians face challenges making clinical decisions in critical situations such as emergent surgery or interventions. This difficulty arises because a specific anti-Xa assay is not available in many laboratories. This study assessed the relationships between rivaroxaban-specific anti-factor Xa activity (AXA) and unfractionated heparin (UFH)-specific AXA. It also determined the cutoff level for UFH-specific AXA in critical situations for patients undergoing rivaroxaban therapy.

- **Methods**: Thirty-eight blood samples were collected from patients with cancer-associated thrombosis receiving rivaroxaban therapy. All samples were assessed using both rivaroxaban-specific and UFH-specific anti-Xa assays. Routine coagulation studies, including prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time, were conducted on the samples.

- **Results**: A positive dose-dependent correlation between rivaroxaban-specific and UFH-specific AXA was evident (R = 0.97; P < .0001). Rivaroxaban-specific AXA was also positively correlated with PT (R = 0.95; P < .0001) but only weakly with activated partial thromboplastin time (R = 0.67; P < .0001). Patients with plasma rivaroxaban concentrations < 100 ng/mL were found to have UFH-specific AXA < 1.41 IU/mL and PT < 17.3 seconds, with sensitivities of 100% and 93.3%, and specificities of 87.0% and 95.7%, respectively.

- **Conclusions**: Our study demonstrates that UFH-calibrated AXA correlates strongly with plasma rivaroxaban concentration. This assay appears to be sensitive to the presence of rivaroxaban, providing useful information for clinical decision-making in critical situations.

### Direct oral anticoagulant use: A practical guide to common clinical challenges [^113njy2S]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

There are no FDA‐approved methods to monitor the anticoagulant effect of DOACs. Qualitative coagulation assays such as activated partial thromboplastin time, thrombin time, and prothrombin time can be used as first-line tests if evaluation for medication compliance is clinically important. However, these tests are insufficient to assess the degree of anticoagulant effect compared to INR for the management of VKA therapy. Quantitative measures, such as anti–factor Xa levels, plasma drug concentrations, dilute thrombin time, and ecarin thrombin time, are available to directly assess anticoagulation effects. However, quantitative tests do not have an established clinical role, since standardized therapeutic ranges have not been established, and quantitative test results have not been correlated with clinical outcomes.

- **Monitoring parameters**: Other general monitoring parameters include signs and symptoms of bleeding, complete blood count, and a comprehensive metabolic panel, specifically evaluating liver function tests, albumin, total bilirubin, and serum creatinine. These monitoring parameters should be performed in all patients before initiating a DOAC and routinely monitored 1 to 3 months after initiation and then every 6 to 12 months thereafter. More frequent follow-ups based on patient-specific characteristics are recommended in provider plans.

- **Comprehensive DOAC monitoring approach**: In addition to laboratory monitoring, the approach should include the following items assessed at each follow-up: health status and adherence.

### Limitations of specific coagulation tests for direct oral anticoagulants: A critical analysis [^111Nt1ci]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Our study provides a comprehensive overview and head‐to‐head comparison of the diagnostic performance of guideline‐recommended DOAC-specific coagulation tests for the detection of clinically relevant DOAC concentrations. This distinguishes our report from prior studies, which investigated the performance of coagulation tests for the quantification across the whole range of therapeutic drug concentrations. However, these studies failed to inform about the most clinically important aspect: the tests' diagnostic accuracy in detecting patients with DOAC concentrations low enough to allow emergency surgery, thrombolysis, or that do not warrant anticoagulation reversal in case of bleeding. Unlike previous reports, we used real‐life patient samples and the criterion standard for DOAC concentration measurement (UPLC‐MS/MS) as a reference. We included three different coagulation assays for dabigatran measurement and provided a comparison of the impact of the FXa inhibitors rivaroxaban and apixaban on calibrated as well as uncalibrated AXA.

Although our study includes a variety of DOAC-specific assays, we only used a single reagent for each type of test and thus cannot provide data comparing different test reagents. This limitation applies especially to AXA, where a variety of reagents are available. However, reports comparing our reagent (Chromogenix COAMATIC Heparin Test) to other reagents for rivaroxaban and apixaban measurement found no difference in diagnostic performance. Our study does not include the FXa inhibitor edoxaban, as this information was not available at the time of the study.

### The myths behind DOAC measurement: Analyses of prescribing information from different regulatory bodies and a call for harmonization [^115C1MzV]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2022). Low credibility.

Provisional guidance for desirable test characteristics when validating a DOAC LDT requires that each element be performed for each DOAC, even if the reagent kit is the same.

The laboratory should have a plan or strategy to aid clinicians if concomitant anticoagulation exposure is present, such as direct FXa inhibitors and heparin, to assure accurate monitoring. The laboratory should also have a plan or strategy to mitigate the DOAC effect on diagnostic assays, such as lupus anticoagulant, or to provide alternative test methods.

For both scenarios, the neutralization of DOAC using in vitro products, such as activated charcoal or filtering mechanisms, has been described, and the use of these products may be characterized as an LDT since the patient sample has been modified. Consideration of which neutralization method to employ may depend on regional approvals, sample volume requirements, and residual volume after the treatment process.

To validate the use of these DOAC neutralizing products, we recommend post-neutralization precision studies and method comparison analysis, comparing baseline results (i.e. anti-FXa, lupus anticoagulant test) to post-neutralization treatment results using DOAC naïve samples to ensure minimal effect of these devices on test accuracy.

### Comparison of commercial low molecular weight heparin and homemade anti-Xa calibrators to a commercial specific anti-Xa calibrator for plasma rivaroxaban quantification by anti-Xa oral anticoagulant plasma concentration chromogenic assay [^112xwUXL]. Laboratory Medicine (2023). High credibility.

The main concern about measuring the concentration of rivaroxaban by anti-Xa assay in some laboratories is the lack of a commercial specific calibrator in emergencies. Therefore, this study aimed at providing a homemade anti-Xa calibrator and commercial low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) anti-Xa calibrator.

The anti-Xa plasma concentration of rivaroxaban was measured in 70 patients using a commercial specific anti-Xa calibrator, a commercial LMWH anti-Xa calibrator, and a homemade anti-Xa calibrator. We demonstrated a significant correlation and agreement (P < .001) between LMWH-calibrated anti-Xa and the commercial specific calibrator. A significant correlation (P < .001) was found between homemade calibrated anti-Xa made by normal pooled plasma and that calibrated with a commercial specific drug. The nonspecific homemade and LMWH calibrators had excellent agreement (P < .001) and can be used interchangeably.

Our data showed that for estimating rivaroxaban concentrations, the LMWH calibrator could be used as an alternative calibrator in the anti-Xa assay.

### Laboratory assessment of the anticoagulant activity of direct oral anticoagulants: A systematic review [^112Fp2To]. Chest (2017). Low credibility.

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are the treatment of choice for most patients with atrial fibrillation and/or noncancer-associated venous thromboembolic disease. Although routine monitoring of these agents is not required, assessment of anticoagulant effect may be desirable in special situations. The objective of this review was to systematically summarize evidence regarding laboratory assessment of the anticoagulant effects of dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban.

- **Methods**: PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science were searched for studies reporting relationships between drug levels and coagulation assay results.

- **Results**: We identified 109 eligible studies: 35 for dabigatran, 50 for rivaroxaban, 11 for apixaban, and 13 for edoxaban. The performance of standard anticoagulation tests varied across DOACs and reagents; most assays showed insufficient correlation to provide a reliable assessment of DOAC effects. Dilute thrombin time (TT) assays demonstrated a linear correlation (r² = 0.67–0.99) across a range of expected concentrations of dabigatran, as did ecarin-based assays. Calibrated anti-Xa assays demonstrated a linear correlation (r² = 0.78–1.00) across a wide range of concentrations for rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban.

- **Conclusions**: An ideal test, offering both accuracy and precision for measurement of any DOAC, is not widely available. We recommend a dilute TT or ecarin-based assay for assessment of the anticoagulant effect of dabigatran and anti-Xa assays with drug-specific calibrators for direct Xa inhibitors. In the absence of these tests, TT.

### Anticoagulation in patients with chronic kidney disease [^112psHL9]. American Journal of Nephrology (2024). Low credibility.

An important advantage of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) over warfarin is that there is no need for regular pharmacodynamic monitoring. However, in certain clinical situations, the use of an anti-IIa assay for dabigatran or an anti-Xa assay calibrated for factor Xa-inhibitors may be required. These clinical situations include the occurrence of major bleeding, the need for emergent surgery, concerns about drug absorption or adherence, concomitant use of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) inhibitors or inducers, morbid obesity, and patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD). A detailed description of anticoagulant reversal is beyond the scope of this manuscript.

### The influence of free hemoglobin and bilirubin on heparin monitoring by activated partial thromboplastin time and anti-Xa assay [^1129QLhj]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Elevated free hemoglobin (Hb) and bilirubinemia complicate extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and could affect unfractionated heparin (UH) therapy monitoring by anti-Xa assay and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT).

The objective of this study was to compare the in vitro response of anti-Xa and aPTT assays to UH in samples with artificial hyperbilirubinemia and hyperhemoglobinemia. It also aimed to estimate if this interference is observed in vivo in pediatric extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.

The study design involved the measurement of aPTT and anti-Xa activity in plasma spiked with UH and increased concentrations of free Hb and/or conjugated bilirubin. All samples with anti-Xa activity, antithrombin, free Hb, and bilirubin determination, as well as the infused dose of UH from inpatients on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, were extracted from the clinical patient database and analyzed.

Results indicated that each increment of free Hb by 100 mg/dL significantly shortened aPTT, whereas an increment of bilirubin by 6 mg/dL caused significant prolongation of aPTT. A stepwise increase of free Hb and/or bilirubin in plasma decreased anti-Xa activity by 0.03 to 0.05 IU/mL. Samples from extracorporeal membrane oxygenation with free Hb of 50 mg/dL or greater had significantly lower anti-Xa activity compared with normal ones: 0.33 (0.25–0.42) versus 0.4 (0.31–0.48) IU/mL (P = 0.01), despite identical UH infusion and similar antithrombin activity. A moderate increase of free Hb by 59 mg/dL was associated with an absolute decrease of anti-Xa activity by 0.07 IU/mL.

In conclusion, activated partial thromboplastin time and anti-Xa assay are affected by free hemoglobin and bilirubin levels, necessitating meticulous monitoring in clinical settings.

### Recanalisation therapies for acute ischaemic stroke in patients on direct oral anticoagulants [^113deVXA]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2021). Low credibility.

Assessing anticoagulant activity in direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) in the emergency setting is fundamental but not straightforward. Difficulties include test availability and turnaround time, lack of clear cut-off values, and test variability. Conventional, unspecific tests (i.e. INR, activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), thrombin time (TT)), along with drug-specific tests, have been used to monitor DOAC activity.

Recent systematic reviews and the latest International Committee for Standardization in Haematology and International Committee on Thrombosis and Haemostasis recommendations can be summarised as follows: (1) prothrombin time (PT)/INR and aPTT are not reliable tests to assess DOAC concentration, (2) non-specific point-of-care testing lacks responsiveness to detect DOAC presence, and (3) tandem mass spectrometry remains the gold standard; however, drug-calibrated dilute thrombin time, ecarin chromogenic assay, ecarin clotting time, anti-FIIa, and anti-FXa are suitable for rapid quantitation of DOACs.

Although not recommended, some information can be derived from unspecific coagulation tests. A normal TT can rule out relevant concentrations of dabigatran. Anti-Xa inhibitors show some degree of correlation with aPTT and PT/INR; however, results are hampered by overall poor correlations, significant reagent-dependent sensitivities, and variability within assays. Studies in patients with acute stroke show similar results, with normal aPTT and INR in 11%–44% of patients with peak DOAC drug levels.

Mass spectrometry measurements are essential for precise determination of DOAC levels.

### Activated partial thromboplastin time and anti-xa measurements in heparin monitoring: biochemical basis for discordance [^111fkeuW]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2013). Low credibility.

We examined the concordance of heparin levels measured by a chromogenic anti-Xa assay and the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) during unfractionated heparin therapy (UFH) and the biochemical basis for differences between these measures. We also investigated the endogenous thrombin potential (ETP) as a possible measure of anticoagulation. Paired measures of anti-Xa and APTT were performed on 569 samples from 149 patients on UFH. The anti-Xa values and the APTT were concordant in only 54% of measurements.

One hundred twelve samples from 59 patients on UFH were assayed for APTT, anti-Xa, factor II, factor VIII, and ETP. Supratherapeutic APTT values but therapeutic anti-Xa results had decreased factor II activity. Subtherapeutic APTT but therapeutic anti-Xa values had high factor VIII activity. ETP correlated with anticoagulation status and UFH dose. In conclusion, factor II and VIII activity contributes to discordance between APTT and anti-Xa results. ETP measurements may provide an additional assessment of anticoagulation status.

### Monitoring unfractionated heparin (UFH) therapy: which anti-factor Xa assay is appropriate [^115ztVDf]. Thrombosis Research (2007). Low credibility.

Anti-Factor Xa (Anti-Xa) assays specifically determine the anticoagulant activity of UFH by measuring the ability of heparin-bound antithrombin (AT) to inhibit a single enzyme, Factor Xa (FXa). Recent improvements in automation, cost-effectiveness, and accessibility of the assay to clinicians have resulted in the Anti-Xa assay becoming a part of daily clinical practice in many institutions.

- **Objectives**: We hypothesized that different Anti-Xa assays have different applicability for use in clinical settings, depending on the amount of UFH administered. This was investigated in a tertiary pediatric institution.

- **Materials and methods**: Samples were collected from children receiving low-dose UFH of at least 10 IU/kg/h, with or without a previous bolus of up to 25 IU/kg/h, within the previous 6 hours in the PICU and HDU. The high-dose UFH population consisted of children undergoing cardiac catheterization (CC), who received a bolus of UFH of 100 IU/kg body weight, 30 minutes prior to sampling.

- **Results and conclusions**: The Anti-Xa activity for a given dose of UFH was found to vary significantly based on the Anti-Xa assay and the population being monitored. Our study suggests that the MODIFIED COMATIC Anti-Xa assay provides the best physiological measure of the UFH effect in children, as it does not introduce sources of error, such as exogenous AT, which may increase the measured Anti-Factor Xa activity, nor Dextran Sulfate, which can displace plasma protein-bound heparin and once again lead to falsely elevated assay results.

### Limitations of specific coagulation tests for direct oral anticoagulants: A critical analysis [^116gToSn]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). High credibility.

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are an effective and easy-to-use treatment option for conditions that require long-term anticoagulation. Although the fixed-dose scheme omits the requirement of routine coagulation assessment, testing may be needed under certain clinical conditions such as before surgery or invasive procedures, in case of trauma or bleeding, or if thrombolysis for acute ischemic stroke is evaluated.

Ultraperformance liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC‐MS/MS) remains the criterion standard for the exact quantification of DOAC concentrations. However, limited availability and slow turnaround times prevent routine clinical implementation of this method. Hence, if coagulation testing is deemed necessary, clinical practice guidelines advise using DOAC-specific coagulation assays, i.e. diluted thrombin time or ecarin clotting time (ECT) for dabigatran, and chromogenic anti-Xa assays (AXA) for factor Xa (FXa) inhibitors (rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban). For all of these assays, quantitative assessment of DOAC concentrations can be achieved with the help of substance-specific calibrators.

A special situation arises for the FXa inhibitors: AXA are set up in many institutions, but calibrations are mostly limited to the traditional indication of therapeutic drug monitoring during low-molecular-weight heparin therapy. If DOAC-specific calibration is not available, different cut-offs for AXA have been proposed, below which unimpaired coagulation can be expected.

- **Results**: The study presents a detailed analysis of the limitations faced in current coagulation testing practices for DOACs and suggests potential strategies to address these limitations.

### A universal anti-Xa assay for rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban measurements: method validation, diagnostic accuracy and external validation [^113EQKfx]. British Journal of Haematology (2021). Low credibility.

The proportion of the population taking direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) such as rivaroxaban, apixaban, or edoxaban is rapidly increasing, and critical clinical situations occur frequently. A simple and readily available laboratory test that accurately determines these anticoagulants' concentration in various healthcare settings would improve care in this vulnerable population. Routine coagulation tests, which are widely available, are not suitable for determining DOAC drug levels. Anti-Xa assays, which are successfully used for monitoring heparin and low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), were introduced, and a linear relationship was demonstrated in samples spiked with rivaroxaban. DOAC-calibrated anti-Xa activity correlated well with drug concentrations if measured in healthy volunteers and patients.

However, widespread implementation in clinical practice is hampered by two major problems. First, a large study investigating the accuracy of all Xa inhibitors over the full spectrum of concentrations in clinical practice is still missing. Second, providing different assays for the determination of rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban drug levels in a '24/7' service is elaborate and expensive. It would be very convenient if laboratories could use a test that is already available in 24/7 service to determine all three Xa inhibitors. Such a universal anti-Xa assay for the determination of rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban drug levels would simplify laboratory procedures and foster widespread implementation.

### Comparison of clinical outcomes using activated partial thromboplastin time versus antifactor-Xa for monitoring therapeutic unfractionated heparin: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^112YRuDX]. Thrombosis Research (2021). Low credibility.

Continuous intravenous unfractionated heparin (UFH) is a mainstay of therapeutic anticoagulation in the acute setting. The two most common laboratory tests for monitoring UFH are the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and antifactor Xa (anti-Xa) heparin assay. We reviewed the available evidence to evaluate if the choice of monitoring test for UFH therapy is associated with a difference in the clinical outcomes of bleeding, thrombosis, or mortality.

- **Materials and methods**: MEDLINE, Cochrane database, and conference abstracts from the Society of Critical Care Medicine, the American Society of Hematology, and the American College of Clinical Pharmacy were searched for all studies comparing aPTT and anti-Xa monitoring for therapeutic UFH that evaluated outcomes for bleeding, thrombotic events, or mortality. Risk of bias was assessed with the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool and Newcastle Ottawa Scale. Pooled relative risk ratios were calculated using an inverse variance-weighted random-effects model.

- **Results**: Ten studies (n = 6677) were included for analysis. The use of anti-Xa compared to aPTT was not associated with an increased risk of bleeding (RR 1.03; 95% CI 0.8–1.22, I² = 4%) or an increased risk of thrombotic events (RR 0.99; 95% CI 0.76–1.30, I² = 3%). There was no difference in mortality within individual studies, but the data were not suitable for pooled analysis.

- **Conclusions**: Pooled data comparing aPTT vs. anti-Xa for monitoring therapeutic UFH did not suggest differences in the outcomes of bleeding or thrombosis.

### Test of the month: The chromogenic antifactor Xa assay [^117Do328]. American Journal of Hematology (2012). Low credibility.

As the number of anticoagulant drugs increases and new ones are brought to market, the utility of routine screening coagulation tests, such as the prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time, will be significantly reduced in many clinical situations. Although the new anticoagulants are designed to require less frequent monitoring, it is imperative that the proper test is selected when monitoring is needed.

Tests designed for the new generation of drugs may be informative in certain contexts for monitoring anticoagulants that have been in use for many years. Here, we present the chromogenic antifactor Xa assay and demonstrate its utility and limitations in monitoring three anticoagulant drugs: unfractionated heparin, low molecular weight heparin, and fondaparinux, as well as one emerging anticoagulant, rivaroxaban.

### Limitations of specific coagulation tests for direct oral anticoagulants: A critical analysis [^112ANRQv]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Despite their strong overall correlation with DOAC concentrations, DOAC‐specific coagulation tests differ considerably in their diagnostic performance when used in the low concentration spectrum, particularly near the currently accepted safe-for-treatment threshold of 30 ng/mL. All dabigatran‐specific assays reliably detected samples above 30 ng/mL. However, the limited specificity of the HTI test poses a high risk of unwarranted anticoagulation reversal or unnecessary treatment delays. BDTI and ECT provided better diagnostic performance for this indication.

For rivaroxaban, AXA yielded excellent results and demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity. Apixaban, on the other hand, had a much less pronounced impact on this assay. Based on the results of our study, we recommend exercising extreme caution if AXA is used to assess hemostatic function in apixaban‐treated patients.

### The myths behind DOAC measurement: Analyses of prescribing information from different regulatory bodies and a call for harmonization [^11678fbM]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2022). Low credibility.

- **Testing myth 2 — Methods for rapid testing are too expensive for implementation**: Defining what is expensive is subjective in any organization and also depends on reimbursement and regional policies. The basic premise is defining a "cost-per-reportable" that indicates the expenses associated with performing a test, which may include direct costs (reagents, supplies, maintenance contracts, technical time/labor related to the specific measurand testing) and indirect costs (phlebotomy cost, supplies, administrative costs). In the hemostasis laboratory, the more tests you perform, the lower the cost-per-reportable because limitations for direct costs would include QC testing, reagent stability, number of tests per vial, and laboratory scientist time, which may be the same for performing one test or 100 tests. High-volume tests such as PT/INR and APTT tend to have a lower cost-per-reportable than lower volume tests such as anti-FXa measurements.

As previously mentioned, indications for measuring DOACs would include acute or emergent management, which may comprise the use of reversal agents. When looking at the cost-per-reportable at a single site (R.C.G.) for quantitative DOAC testing, the annual cost for these specialized tests is significantly lower than the cost for a single dose of DOAC reversal therapies. For direct FXa inhibitors, the same anti-FXa kit can be used to measure any direct FXa inhibitor with drug-specific calibrators/controls. However, it must be emphasized that this anti-FXa measuring method cannot differentiate between anti-FXa drugs.

### Neutralising rivaroxaban induced interference in laboratory testing for lupus anticoagulant (LA): A comparative study using DOAC Stop as well as andexanet alfa [^116y8xzW]. Thrombosis Research (2019). Low credibility.

Investigation into lupus anticoagulant (LA) in patients undergoing anticoagulant therapy presents challenges due to interference. Specifically, rivaroxaban significantly affects LA screening and confirmation tests, prolonging results and falsely raising LA screen/confirm ratios, potentially leading to incorrect LA identification. The Russell Viper Venom Time (RVVT) assay, crucial for LA investigation, is particularly sensitive to rivaroxaban.

- **Materials and methods**: We assessed cross-laboratory (n = 82) testing of four samples to determine whether rivaroxaban-induced interference in LA testing could be neutralized. Testing was conducted blindly regarding sample type. The samples included: (A) a pool of normal plasma (LA-negative control); (B) sample A spiked with rivaroxaban (200 ng/mL) to create rivaroxaban-induced interference (LA 'false' positive sample); (C) sample B subsequently treated with a commercial 'DOAC-neutralizer' (DOAC Stop); (D) sample B treated with andexanet alfa (200 μg/mL).

- **Results**: The rivaroxaban-spiked sample (B) predictably prolonged most LA tests and generated a falsely prolonged RVVT screen/confirm ratio (median 1.37, compared to 0.97 for sample A). The sample (C) treated with DOAC Stop demonstrated a correction in LA-test clotting times and neutralized the false positive LA (median RVVT screen/confirm ratio of 0.99). Although the andexanet alfa treated sample (D) also produced a low median RVVT screen/confirm ratio of 0.88, it did not fully correct LA-test clotting times. Consistent with test findings, all laboratories interpreted samples A and C.

### The myths behind DOAC measurement: Analyses of prescribing information from different regulatory bodies and a call for harmonization [^112xvgbg]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2022). Low credibility.

- **Testing myth 1 — Methods for testing are time-consuming and result in too long for acute clinical use or need**: Specific tests for screening or quantifying direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are not time-consuming compared with other traditional hemostasis assays. When examining the protocols for testing related to dabigatran, the diluted thrombin time (dTT) and activated clotting time (ECT) assays are clot-based assays with similar testing durations to fibrinogen or thrombin time tests. The ecarin chromogenic assay (ECA) methods can also be automated, requiring three different reagents. The first reagent is a diluent, followed by two test reagents (ecarin and substrate) for a total of three independent steps. This procedure is akin to conducting a UFH or LMWH level using anti-FXa testing. For FXa DOACs, the difference between a UFH/LMWH reported result and a DOAC reported result lies only in the calibrator source; the stepwise protocols are otherwise equivalent, meaning the test turnaround time (TAT) would be similar to that of heparin levels.

	- Thus, the time needed for DOAC-specific test calibration does not exceed that for a heparin chromogenic assay and approximately equates to the time required to finalize five tests. Moreover, most analyzers can run multiple samples simultaneously, facilitating a swift calibration procedure, typically around 10–15 minutes once the reagents and calibrators are loaded. However, it is important to note that calibrators and some reagents may require reconstitution, potentially adding approximately 30 additional minutes, as calibrators need to stabilize afterward.

### Measurement of the new anticoagulants [^116dg1h1]. Thrombosis Research (2012). Low credibility.

New oral anticoagulants are given at fixed daily doses without laboratory dose adjustment for the prevention of venous thromboembolism following elective total knee and hip replacement; for the treatment and prevention of recurrent acute venous thromboembolism; and for the prevention of embolic events in atrial fibrillation. However, it may be necessary to determine the anticoagulant effect of these new oral anticoagulants in special patient populations, such as the elderly, individuals with renal impairment, patients before undergoing surgery, those experiencing bleeding or thrombotic episodes, and to monitor self-compliance.

Oral factor Xa and oral thrombin inhibitors influence, in a dose-dependent manner, both global and specific coagulation assays. Standardization of assays is currently being undertaken. Determining the presence of new oral anticoagulants in serum samples would facilitate blood sampling and analysis from samples taken and stored for creatinine or other biochemical parameters. Point-of-care methods from plasma or urine for the new oral anticoagulants would improve patient care. Initial data demonstrate the feasibility of such assays in urine.

### Direct oral anticoagulant monitoring: What laboratory tests are available to guide us [^1163Rd8w]. Hematology. American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2019). Low credibility.

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are increasingly used in the treatment and prophylaxis of thromboembolism because of several advantages over vitamin K antagonists, including no need for laboratory monitoring. However, it has become increasingly important in certain clinical scenarios to know either actual DOAC concentration (quantitative) or presence of DOAC (qualitative). These clinical conditions include patients presenting with major bleeding or requiring urgent surgery who may need a reversal or hemostatic agent, extremes of body weight, and failed therapy.

Prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time are variably affected by factor Xa inhibitors (FXaIs) and direct thrombin inhibitors (DTI), respectively, depending on reagents' sensitivity; hence, they cannot be relied on confidently. Thrombin time is highly sensitive to very low amounts of DTI; thus, normal value rules out a clinically significant amount. Liquid chromatography mass spectrometry accurately measures DOAC levels but is clinically impractical.

- **Dilute thrombin time and ecarin-based assays**: Using appropriate calibrators/controls, these provide an accurate DTI level.
- **Anti-Xa assay**: Utilizing corresponding FXaI calibrators/controls, this provides accurate drug levels. However, these assays are not readily available in the United States compared to some other parts of the world.
- **Heparin assays**: Using anti-Xa activity, these often have a linear relationship with calibrated FXaI assays, especially at the lower end of on-therapy levels, and may provide rapid assessment of drug activity for clinical decision making.

### Limitations of specific coagulation tests for direct oral anticoagulants: A critical analysis [^112vTenB]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

The diagnostic accuracy of calibrated AXA for FXa inhibitors was examined in this study. Calibrated AXA underestimated rivaroxaban concentrations by a mean of −7.7 ± 29.0 ng/mL, with a 95% confidence interval [−12.4, −3.0], as illustrated in Figure 2A. Two samples, containing 34 and 43 ng/mL, were misclassified as < 30 ng/mL. Furthermore, one out of 146 samples was incorrectly classified as being above the 30 ng/mL threshold. Test accuracy calculations, referenced in Table 4, demonstrated high sensitivity (98.2%) and specificity (97.1%).

- **Figure 2: Diagnostic accuracy of anti-Xa activity testing**:
	- **Left**: The scatter plots indicate the correlation of inhibitor concentrations (A: rivaroxaban; B: apixaban) determined by criterion standard and calibrated anti-Xa activity testing. Green dots represent samples correctly identified as either below or above the safe-for-treatment threshold of 30 ng/mL (true-negative and true-positive results). Red dots denote samples incorrectly identified as below the safe-for-treatment threshold (false negative). Orange dots denote samples incorrectly identified as above the safe-for-treatment threshold (false positive).
	- **Right**: The Bland-Altman plot shows the mean measurement error and standard deviation of test results, comparing criterion standard and anti-Xa activity results. UPLC–MS/MS indicates ultraperformance liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry.

Less accurate results were observed for apixaban, as shown in Figure 2B. Calibrated AXA underestimated real apixaban concentrations by a mean of −10.2 ± 22.2 ng/mL, with a 95% confidence interval [−13.7, −6.7]. Thirty-three out of 126 samples containing apixaban concentrations above the safe-for-treatment threshold were misclassified by the test as < 30 ng/mL.

### The myths behind DOAC measurement: Analyses of prescribing information from different regulatory bodies and a call for harmonization [^117FfHNP]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2022).

- **Recommendations for laboratory screening or quantifying**: If the laboratory is providing screening tests sufficiently sensitive to detect around 25–30 ng/ml of DOACs, there should be accompanying information with the test result to indicate laboratory-verified test sensitivity. For laboratories using LMWH-calibrated anti-FXa to screen for direct FXa inhibitors, we suggest the test be reported as "not detected" or "detected", with information provided that the lower limit of quantitation associated with LMWH is "estimated" to be a given concentration of FXa DOAC based on local laboratory findings.

Before implementing a DOAC quantitative assay, we strongly recommend the laboratory consult clinical stakeholders for their feedback. Early recommendations suggest trough time collections be used, although more recent studies suggest peak values may be associated with bleeding risks. For laboratories that provide quantitative DOAC measurements, we recommend that: (1) each DOAC be a separate orderable test to ensure the proper drug-calibrated test is used, (2) each result is accompanied by an expected "within therapy" range traceable to clinical study or peer-reviewed publication based on collection time (peak or trough), and (3) results reported in ng/ml when properly drug-calibrated. DOAC levels required for acute or emergent clinical needs should be reported within 30 min of receipt in the testing laboratory.

### Do new oral anticoagulants require laboratory monitoring? The clinician point of view [^115dkaES]. Thrombosis Research (2012). Low credibility.

Although no laboratory monitoring is needed for new anticoagulants, the measurement of their activity is required in special clinical situations. Standardized tests have been developed for rivaroxaban and dabigatran, which allow the measurement of the patient's response to the drug at Cmax (2 to 3 hours after intake) or at trough (before repeated administration). The results can be expressed in mg per mL of plasma and compared to the expected concentrations.

The influence of the new anticoagulants on coagulation assays has been determined. Several clinical cases of major bleeding have been reported, and a severe coagulopathy was found in these patients (prolonged PT and aPTT, increased drug concentration in plasma). These observations raise the question regarding the potential benefit of laboratory coagulation monitoring from time to time. Trials are needed to determine the relationship of assay results with bleeding or thrombotic complications.

Pros and cons of laboratory measurements are discussed.

### Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) in the laboratory: 2015 review [^116wj5h3]. Thrombosis Research (2015). Low credibility.

Direct oral anticoagulant therapies, including direct anti-Xa and thrombin inhibitors, have recently been introduced and may have advantages over vitamin K antagonists such as warfarin. This review briefly describes the clinical utility and mechanism of action of these agents.

Detailed information is provided on the effect of these agents on routine assays, including the APTT and PT, as well as their impact on specialty laboratory assays. It also includes the use of drug-specific assays and a discussion of alternative methods to determine relative drug concentration, such as evaluating drug calibrators in APTT and PT assays and using heparin-calibrated anti-Xa assays to measure direct Xa inhibitors.

### The myths behind DOAC measurement: Analyses of prescribing information from different regulatory bodies and a call for harmonization [^113BCB7m]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2022). Low credibility.

Such situations are not isolated; several case reports have mentioned dabigatran exposure as high as 3000 ng/ml and rivaroxaban exposure as high as 2500 ng/ml. This is not so occasional. In our own laboratories, levels close to 2500 ng/ml have also been measured in some patients. Thus, for patients with high DOAC exposure, additional reversal doses may be required, as suggested in the PI of Praxbind®.

A cautionary note is warranted about post-reversal DOAC measurements because rebound of dabigatran concentration after Praxbind® administration has been described. Factitious anti-FXa levels (falsely increased FXa DOAC level) resulted from in vitro dissociation of andexanet alfa with anti-FXa methods that use a high predilution of the sample. Post-treatment anti-FXa measurements as a surrogate of hemostatic efficacy have not been demonstrated.

### Novel oral anticoagulants: Efficacy, laboratory measurement, and approaches to emergent reversal [^112EiJjk]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Warfarin, the most commonly used vitamin K antagonist, has been a mainstay of oral anticoagulation for decades. However, its usage is limited by morbidity and mortality secondary to bleeding, as well as a cumbersome therapeutic monitoring process. In recent years, several novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) have been developed, each aspiring to match or exceed warfarin's effectiveness while mitigating bleeding risk and eliminating the need for therapeutic monitoring. Currently, one oral direct thrombin inhibitor and two direct factor Xa inhibitors are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration.

This article compares the clinical efficacy and safety profiles of these new drugs. Additionally, it discusses laboratory assays that may be useful for measuring these drugs in specific clinical circumstances. Lastly, emerging strategies to reverse these agents in an emergency are explored. The purpose of this article is to provide a framework for practicing pathologists to advise clinicians on NOAC laboratory measurement and the management of NOAC-associated bleeding.

### A universal anti-Xa assay for rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban measurements: Method validation, diagnostic accuracy and external validation [^117VQfjQ]. British Journal of Haematology (2021). Low credibility.

How should the universal assay be applied? Two different options appear feasible and are illustrated in Table I. First, cut‐off values for the clinical thresholds of 30, 50, and 100 µg/l can be given. The corresponding categorical result is the most crucial information, which might directly prompt clinical decision-making. Second, the regression equations can be employed to determine drug levels as accurately as possible.

Our present findings confirm that low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH)-calibrated anti-Xa assays can serve as universal anti-Xa assays to determine rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban drug concentrations in clinical practice. Although high accuracy was observed at all clinically relevant cut‐offs, a wider spread and a non‐linear curve were noted in samples with high drug levels. This effect is attributed to the maximum level measurable with the LMWH-calibrated assay (3.34 u/ml, corresponding to a drug level of 483 µg/l). While this effect may not alter most clinical decisions, drug levels might be underestimated in cases of intoxications and accumulation. Nonetheless, LMWH‐calibrated assays may simplify laboratory procedures and reduce healthcare costs; they could promote the implementation of anti-Xa assays in various institutions. However, the adoption of this universal assay for determining direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) drug levels is contingent upon national in vitro diagnostics (IVD) regulations and potential Conformité Européene (CE) labeling by the manufacturer. In our laboratory, we implemented it as a laboratory‐developed in‐house test.

### Poor comparability of coagulation screening test with specific measurement in patients receiving direct oral anticoagulants: results from a multicenter/multiplatform study [^113pprTM]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2016). Low credibility.

Essentials: Prothrombin and partial thromboplastin time (PT/PTT) measure direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs). PT, PTT, and specific tests for DOACs were performed on patients treated for atrial fibrillation. Normal PT/PTT do not exclude DOAC activity, and their prolongation does not confirm DOAC action. The use of PT or PTT to evaluate DOAC activity could cause dangerous misinterpretations.

Summary:

- **Background**: Prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) have been proposed to measure the effect of oral anti-activated factor X (FXa) or anti-activated FII drugs, respectively.

- **Aims**: To evaluate the relationships and responsiveness of PT and APTT versus direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) concentrations measured with specific coagulation tests performed with different platforms in four Italian anticoagulation clinics.

- **Methods**: Six hundred and thirty-five patients with atrial fibrillation participated in the study: 240 were receiving dabigatran, 264 were receiving rivaroxaban, and 131 were receiving apixaban. Blood was taken at trough and peak within the first month (15–25 days) of treatment. PT, APTT, diluted thrombin time (dTT) calibrated for dabigatran and anti-FXa calibrated for rivaroxaban or apixaban were determined.

- **Results**: For dabigatran, the correlation between APTT and dTT ranged from r = 0.80 to r = 0.62. For rivaroxaban, the correlation between the anti-FXa assay and PT ranged from r = 0.91 to r = 0.73. For apixaban, the correlation between the anti-FXa assay and PT was lower than for the two other drugs, ranging from r = 0.81 to r = 0.54.
