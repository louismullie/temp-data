## Question

What labs to order when suspecting pregnancy in a female with history of miscarriage?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what labs to order when suspecting pregnancy in a female with a history of miscarriage. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the current pregnancy and dating. Then, I should verify which baseline prenatal labs are universally indicated. Next, I will consider what additional tests are warranted specifically because of prior miscarriage, including antiphospholipid syndrome, thyroid dysfunction, and parental karyotyping. After that, I need to check which tests are not recommended routinely, such as inherited thrombophilia and infection screens. Finally, I will integrate special scenarios like second-trimester losses, products-of-conception testing, and counseling points, and then summarize a practical algorithm with caveats about timing and interpretation.

> Let me first confirm the immediate priority: establish whether she is pregnant now and how far along she is, because management hinges on that. A sensitive urine hCG is appropriate for initial screening, but if results are discordant with the clinical picture or if dating is uncertain, a quantitative serum hCG with a single measurement and, if needed, serial measurements can clarify viability and trajectory, keeping in mind that serial hCG should be interpreted with ultrasound rather than in isolation to avoid misclassification of ectopic or nonviable pregnancies [^f7fe4686] [^05881c43] [^4aaf3f4b].

> Wait, let me verify the role of ultrasound in this context. Transvaginal ultrasound becomes informative when β-hCG reaches roughly 1,500–3,000 mIU/mL, at which point a gestational sac should be visible if intrauterine, though discriminatory thresholds vary and should be applied cautiously to avoid interrupting a desired intrauterine pregnancy, so I should align imaging with symptoms and quantitative hCG trends rather than a rigid cutoff [^eab7c5ec] [^75f9b4b2].

> Next, I should review universal baseline prenatal labs that are indicated regardless of prior miscarriage history. These include a CBC with differential to screen for anemia and infection, ABO/Rh with antibody screen to guide Rh immunoprophylaxis, rubella immunity to identify those needing postpartum vaccination, hepatitis B surface antigen, and syphilis screening, with HIV screening offered per local protocols. These remain standard in early pregnancy care and should not be omitted [^notfound].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about thrombophilia. I initially thought to add inherited thrombophilia testing because of prior miscarriage, but I should double-check guideline direction. Multiple high-credibility sources advise against routine inherited thrombophilia screening in recurrent pregnancy loss, including RCOG 2023, BSH 2022, and CHEST 2012, because evidence does not show improved outcomes with anticoagulation in these patients, so I should avoid ordering factor V Leiden, prothrombin G20210A, protein C/S, antithrombin, or MTHFR in the absence of specific risk factors or research context [^04fff0cb] [^8df2e758] [^d0faa302] [^bb7394ec].

> I will now examine antiphospholipid syndrome, because this is the thrombophilic condition with actionable implications in RPL. Testing is indicated after two or more miscarriages, ideally timed when the patient is not pregnant or at least 6 weeks postpartum, and should include lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin IgG/IgM, and anti-β2-glycoprotein I, with repeat confirmation after 12 weeks if positive, given the need for persistent positivity to establish diagnosis and the potential to change management with aspirin and heparin in future pregnancies [^0d973464] [^d0faa302] [^1c46240e].

> Let me consider endocrine contributors next. Thyroid dysfunction is associated with miscarriage, so I should obtain TSH and consider anti-TPO antibodies in those with RPL. If TSH is abnormal or antibodies are present, free T4 helps define management, and treatment of overt hypothyroidism is indicated, though evidence for treating subclinical hypothyroidism in RPL is mixed, so I should individualize and counsel accordingly [^87662bbf] [^e5eb28db].

> I need to ensure I address genetic etiologies that are more likely to recur. Parental karyotyping is reasonable after two or more losses, particularly if losses occurred early and no other cause is identified, because balanced translocations are found in a small but meaningful subset and inform counseling and reproductive planning, including consideration of preimplantation genetic testing in select cases [^5a908280].

> But wait, what if the losses were in the second trimester or suggest cervical factors. In that scenario, I should confirm whether there is a history suggestive of cervical insufficiency and consider targeted evaluation such as serial cervical ultrasound in a subsequent pregnancy, and I should keep in mind that second-trimester losses are less often due to aneuploidy and more often due to anatomic, infectious, immunologic, or thrombotic/placental factors, which may shift the investigative emphasis [^6f6b70d1] [^3257e403].

> Next, I should review what not to order routinely. Infection screening such as toxoplasma, CMV, parvovirus, or bacterial vaginosis is not recommended in RPL workups outside research settings, and routine NK cell testing, autoimmune panels like ANA, or prolactin are not supported by evidence for improving outcomes in RPL, so I should avoid these unless clinically indicated by specific symptoms or history [^45df5850] [^2f2b03ee] [^cbf2c11b].

> Let me think about products of conception testing, because this can change the need for further workup. If the patient experiences another loss, obtaining chromosomal microarray or traditional karyotype on POC can identify aneuploidy as the cause, which would obviate further maternal testing in many cases and refine recurrence risk counseling, though availability depends on tissue acquisition and local pathology resources [^5a908280] [^cd5cf884].

> I should confirm timing and pretest counseling. Many RPL evaluations are deferred until after recovery from a current pregnancy, and antiphospholipid testing is best done when not pregnant or well postpartum to avoid false positives, so I need to coordinate the workup with the patient's immediate reproductive goals and emotional readiness, and ensure informed consent for genetic testing and its implications [^1c46240e].

> Putting this together, my practical approach is as follows: confirm current pregnancy with urine or serum hCG and date with ultrasound when appropriate. Obtain universal prenatal labs. Add APS testing after two losses if not already done, ensuring proper timing and confirmatory testing. Include TSH with consideration of anti-TPO and free T4 if indicated. Consider parental karyotyping after two or more unexplained losses. Avoid routine inherited thrombophilia, infection screens, NK cell testing, and ANA. And if another loss occurs, pursue POC genetic testing to clarify etiology and guide next steps, all while aligning with the patient's preferences and timeline [^f7fe4686] [^0d973464] [^87662bbf] [^5a908280] [^04fff0cb] [^45df5850].

For a patient with a history of miscarriage and suspected pregnancy, order a **urine or serum hCG** to confirm pregnancy [^f7fe4686], then obtain **CBC, ABO/Rh, and antibody screen** to assess anemia and Rh status [^notfound]. If there is a history of recurrent pregnancy loss, add **antiphospholipid antibodies** (lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin, anti-β2-glycoprotein I) [^0d973464] and **thyroid function tests** (TSH, free T4) [^87662bbf]. Consider **progesterone** if bleeding or threatened miscarriage is present [^32401e16], and reserve **parental karyotyping** for couples with two or more losses. Do not order routine inherited thrombophilia testing [^04fff0cb] or infection screens unless clinically indicated [^45df5850].

---

## Initial pregnancy confirmation

Order a **urine or serum hCG** to confirm pregnancy; urine tests are highly sensitive and specific [^f7fe4686], while serum hCG provides quantitative data for trend monitoring [^fe836fd2].

---

## Basic prenatal laboratory evaluation

Regardless of miscarriage history, obtain the following **standard prenatal labs**:

| **Laboratory test** | **Purpose** |
|-|-|
| Complete blood count (CBC) | Assess for anemia, infection, or hematologic disorders [^notfound] |
| ABO blood group and Rh type | Determine Rh status for Rh immunoglobulin administration if indicated [^fc739723] |
| Antibody screen | Identify alloimmunization risk [^notfound] |
| Rubella immunity | Determine need for postpartum vaccination [^notfound] |
| Hepatitis B surface antigen | Screen for hepatitis B infection [^notfound] |
| Syphilis serology (RPR or VDRL) | Screen for syphilis infection [^notfound] |
| HIV screening | Screen for HIV infection [^notfound] |

## Additional laboratory evaluation for patients with a history of miscarriage

### Recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) evaluation

If the patient has a history of two or more miscarriages, consider the following **additional tests**:

- **Antiphospholipid antibody testing**: Lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibodies (IgG and IgM), and anti-β2-glycoprotein I antibodies [^0d973464] [^d0faa302].

- **Thyroid function tests**: TSH and free T4 to assess for thyroid dysfunction, which is associated with miscarriage [^87662bbf].

- **Parental karyotyping**: Consider in couples with two or more miscarriages to identify balanced chromosomal rearrangements [^5a908280].

---

### Specific clinical scenarios

- **Progesterone levels**: Consider in patients with bleeding or threatened miscarriage, as low progesterone may indicate luteal phase defect or impending miscarriage [^32401e16] [^bd0ed2fc].

- **Infection screening**: Not routinely recommended unless clinically indicated (e.g. history of fever, immunocompromise, or exposure to specific pathogens) [^45df5850] [^b18cd813].

- **Inherited thrombophilia testing**: Not routinely recommended unless there is a personal or family history of venous thromboembolism or specific clinical indications [^04fff0cb] [^8df2e758].

---

## Summary of recommended laboratory tests

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended laboratory tests** |
|-|-|
| Suspected pregnancy (any history) | - Urine or serum hCG [^f7fe4686] <br/> - CBC <br/> - ABO/Rh <br/> - Antibody screen <br/> - Rubella immunity <br/> - Hepatitis B surface antigen <br/> - Syphilis serology <br/> - HIV screening [^notfound] |
| History of miscarriage (single or recurrent) | - Above basic prenatal labs <br/> - Antiphospholipid antibodies (if RPL) [^0d973464] <br/> - Thyroid function tests (if RPL) [^87662bbf] <br/> - Parental karyotyping (if two or more losses) [^5a908280] |
| Threatened miscarriage (bleeding) | - Above basic prenatal labs <br/> - Progesterone level [^32401e16] |

---

## Conclusion

For a patient with a history of miscarriage and suspected pregnancy, start with **basic prenatal labs** and add **antiphospholipid antibodies**, **thyroid function tests**, and **parental karyotyping** if there are two or more losses. Reserve **progesterone testing** for bleeding or threatened miscarriage, and avoid routine inherited thrombophilia or infection screening unless clinically indicated.

### Evidence-based investigations and treatments of recurrent pregnancy loss [^a789d35e]. Fertility and Sterility (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To give an overview of currently used investigations and treatments offered to women with recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) and, from an evidence-based point of view, to evaluate the usefulness of these interventions.

Design

Ten experts on epidemiologic, genetic, anatomic, endocrinologic, thrombophilic, immunologic, and immunogenetic aspects of RPL discussed methodologic problems threatening the validity of research in RPL during and after an international workshop on the evidence-based management of RPL.

Conclusion(S)

Most RPL patients have several risk factors for miscarriage, and an extensive investigation for all major factors should always be undertaken. There is an urgent need for agreement concerning the thresholds for detecting what is normal and abnormal, irrespective of whether laboratory tests or uterine abnormalities are concerned. A series of lifestyle factors should be reported in future studies of RPL because they might modify the effect of laboratory or anatomic risk factors. More and larger randomized controlled trials, including trials of surgical procedures, are urgently needed, and to achieve this objective multiple centers have to collaborate. Current meta-analyses evaluating the efficacy of treatments of RPL are generally pooling very heterogeneous patient populations and treatments. It is recommended that future meta-analyses look at subsets of patients and treatment protocols that are more combinable.

### Second trimester pregnancy loss [^3257e403]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

Second trimester pregnancy loss is uncommon, but it should be regarded as an important event in a woman's obstetric history. Fetal abnormalities, including chromosomal problems, and maternal anatomic factors, immunologic factors, infection, and thrombophilia should be considered; however, a cause-and-effect relationship may be difficult to establish. A thorough history and physical examination should include inquiries about previous pregnancy loss. Laboratory tests may identify treatable etiologies. Although there is limited evidence that specific interventions improve outcomes, management of contributing maternal factors (e.g., smoking, substance abuse) is essential. Preventive measures, including vaccination and folic acid supplementation, are recommended regardless of risk. Management of associated chromosomal factors requires consultation with a genetic counselor or obstetrician. The family physician can play an important role in helping the patient and her family cope with the emotional aspects of pregnancy loss.

### Recurrent pregnancy loss: evaluation and treatment [^67cbde81]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) is a multifactorial condition. Approximately half of patients with RPL will have no explanation for their miscarriages. De novo chromosome abnormalities are common in sporadic and recurrent pregnancy loss. Testing for embryonic abnormalities can provide an explanation for the miscarriage in many cases and prognostic information. Regardless of the cause of RPL, patients should be reassured that the prognosis for live birth with an evidence-based approach is excellent for most patients. The authors review current evidence for the evaluation and treatment of RPL and explore the proposed use of newer technology for patients with RPL.

### Recurrent miscarriage clinics [^b593530b]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

A recurrent miscarriage clinic offers specialist investigation and treatment of women with recurrent first- and second-trimester miscarriages. Consultant-led clinics provide a dedicated and focused service to couples who have experienced at least two prior miscarriages. The best treatment strategy for couples with recurrent miscarriage is to discuss a treatment plan for a future pregnancy. Evidence-based up-to-date guidelines are required to reduce ineffective management of recurrent miscarriage couples, including overdiagnostics and underdiagnostics. Scientific research is necessary to study the effectiveness of new interventions, to study patient preferences, and to evaluate health care and costs or other outcomes.

### Genetic evaluation and counseling of couples with recurrent miscarriage: recommendations of the National Society of Genetic Counselors [^8280eebc]. Journal of Genetic Counseling (2005). Low credibility.

The objective of this document is to provide recommendations for genetic evaluation and counseling of couples with recurrent miscarriage (RM). The recommendations are the opinions of the multidisciplinary Inherited Pregnancy Loss Working Group (IPLWG), with expertise in genetic counseling, medical genetics, maternal fetal medicine, internal medicine, infectious disease, cytogenetics, and coagulation disorders. The IPLWG defines RM as three or more clinically recognized consecutive or non-consecutive pregnancy losses occurring prior to fetal viability (<24 weeks gestation). These recommendations are provided to assist genetic counselors and other health care providers in clinical decision-making, as well as to promote consistency of patient care, guide the allocation of medical resources, and increase awareness of the psychosocial and cultural issues experienced by couples with RM. The IPLWG was convened with support from the March of Dimes Western Washington State Chapter and the University of Washington Division of Medical Genetics. The recommendations are U.S. Preventive Task Force Class III, and are based on clinical experiences, review of pertinent English-language published articles, and reports of expert committees. This document reviews the suspected causes of RM, provides indications for genetic evaluation and testing, addresses psychosocial and cultural considerations, and provides professional and patient resources. These recommendations should not be construed as dictating an exclusive course of medical management, nor does the use of such recommendations guarantee a particular outcome. The professional judgment of a health care provider, familiar with the circumstances of a specific case, should always supersede these recommendations.

### Providing quality family planning services in the United States: recommendations of the U.S. Office of Population Affairs (revised 2024) [^8f244a1f]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Early pregnancy loss—confirmation and management states that early pregnancy loss during the first trimester is commonly known as miscarriage or spontaneous abortion; because many are unable to establish prenatal care until after the first trimester, providers of SRH care should be able to identify signs and symptoms of early pregnancy loss and be equipped to provide appropriate treatment or referrals, and all pregnant persons should receive information about signs and symptoms and be given instructions to report concerns for further evaluation; providers can confirm early pregnancy loss by reviewing medical history, identifying signs and symptoms such as vaginal spotting or bleeding with or without pain and bleeding and/or passage of tissue, and/or by conducting a physical exam that may include a pelvic ultrasound and quantitative β-hCG testing; pregnancy loss can be managed expectantly, with medications, or with uterine aspiration, with expectant management essentially “wait and watch” with no medical interventions; persons experiencing pregnancy loss may benefit from additional social support and providers can assess need and refer to appropriate counseling or supportive services.

### Diagnosis and management of Q fever – United States, 2013: recommendations from CDC and the Q fever working group [^7ed395cb]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Pregnant women—Q fever in relation to pregnancy is characterized by adverse outcomes and specific management considerations: infections that occur shortly before conception or during pregnancy might result in miscarriage, stillbirth, premature birth, intrauterine growth retardation, or low birthweight, and reports describing outcomes of infected pregnant women note that none have documented an increased risk for congenital malformations because of infection; a woman with a previous infection (>30 days before conception) with no evidence of progression to chronic disease does not require treatment during pregnancy, whereas a Q fever infection during pregnancy requires antibiotic treatment and health-care providers should consider several factors to determine the best treatment approach, with careful assessment of serologic results because the phase II antibody response is increased in patients with an acute infection but decreases during convalescence as the phase I antibody response increases; risks are highest when an acute infection occurs during the first trimester, with untreated infection in the first trimester more likely to result in miscarriage and infection later in pregnancy more likely to cause premature delivery; women infected with acute Q fever during pregnancy might be at risk for recrudescent infection during subsequent pregnancies, and pregnant women with a history of Q fever infection during a previous pregnancy should be monitored closely for recrudescent infection in all subsequent pregnancies; health-care providers should educate women of child-bearing age who receive a diagnosis of acute Q fever of potential risks to the fetus, and these women should be advised to avoid pregnancy for at least 1 month after diagnosis and treatment and should receive a pregnancy test to determine whether long-term antibiotic treatment is needed.

### Patient history and physician suspicion accurately exclude pregnancy [^fd897048]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Objectives

Reliance upon patient assessment in excluding pregnancy is questionable. Physicians are encouraged to obtain pregnancy tests in all women of childbearing age. We affirmed the accuracy of women and their physicians in predicting pregnancy.

Methods

This was a prospective, observational study performed in a suburban academic emergency department on adult women with an ordered pregnancy test. A standardized gynecologic history was obtained by trained research assistants. Subjects estimated their likelihood of pregnancy as impossible, possible, or definite. Emergency department physicians estimated the likelihood of pregnancy as high, moderate, or low. All women had either a serum or urine β-human chorionic antigen. The diagnostic characteristics of patient and physician predictions of pregnancy were calculated with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

Results

We enrolled 377 subjects. Median age was 29 (interquartile range, 22-37) years. Twelve percent of the women were pregnant. Women's estimates of pregnancy were as follows: impossible, 64.7%; possible, 22.5%; and definite, 12.7%. The pregnancy rates among women with estimates of impossible, possible, and definite were 0% (95% CI, 0%-1.5%), 4.7% (95% CI, 1.9%-11.5%), and 89.6% (95% CI, 77.8%-95.5%) (P < .001). Physicians' suspicions of pregnancy were high (13.7%), moderate (11.3%), and low (75.1%). The rate of pregnancy among low, moderate, and high physician suspicion groups were 0% (95% CI, 0%-1.4%), 9.5% (95% CI, 3.8%-22%), and 84.3% (95% CI, 72%-92%) (P < .001).

Conclusions

There were no pregnancies among women who estimated pregnancy as impossible or whose physicians thought that the likelihood of pregnancy was low. Routine pregnancy testing before radiological imaging and medication administration may not be required in adult women of childbearing age.

Recommendations—screening and treatment related to APLAs and inherited thrombophilia in pregnancy: For women with recurrent early pregnancy loss (three or more miscarriages before 10 weeks of gestation), we recommend screening for APLAs (Grade 1B). For women with a history of pregnancy complications, we suggest not to screen for inherited thrombophilia (Grade 2C). For women who fulfill the laboratory criteria for APLA syndrome and meet the clinical APLA criteria based on a history of three or more pregnancy losses, we recommend antepartum administration of prophylactic- or intermediate-dose UFH or prophylactic LMWH combined with low-dose aspirin, 75 to 100 mg/d, over no treatment (Grade 1B). For women with inherited thrombophilia and a history of pregnancy complications, we suggest not to use antithrombotic prophylaxis (Grade 2C).

### Dos and don'ts in diagnosing antiphospholipid syndrome [^86278e91]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2012). Low credibility.

Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is an acquired autoimmune thrombotic tendency that is identified by the presence of abnormal antiphospholipid laboratory tests in patients who have a history of vascular thrombosis and/or pregnancy complications including recurrent spontaneous miscarriages and a group of other complications due to placental insufficiency. Diagnostic testing for APS is often problematic because of many misconceptions regarding these empirically derived assays. This chapter is intended to provide hematology-oncology consultants with practical information about the uses and limitations of assays used to diagnose APS.

### Medical history screening for thrombophilic risk: is this adequate? [^42bf62f2]. Fertility and Sterility (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the reliability of medical history taken before hormonal medication administration to identify women with an increased risk for thromboembolic events detected by laboratory screening.

Design

Prospective study.

Setting

Outpatient endocrine clinic of a university-based hospital.

Patient(S)

Four hundred forty-three consecutive women (median age 49 years) who presented with endocrine disorders.

Intervention(S)

None.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Parallel screening, on first visit, with a complete medical history, and same-day laboratory screening for thromboembolic risk. Laboratory examination in a two-step procedure with a standard assay and confirmation by genotyping on the second visit.

Result(S)

A total of 13.8% (61/443) patients with an abnormal activated protein C (APC) resistance test were identified. Second blood samples revealed a prevalence of factor V (Leiden) heterozygosity in 10.9% (homozygosity in 0.2%). There was a significantly higher prevalence of thrombotic events in a first degree relative of patients with APC resistance (in 18.3%) compared with women with a normal test outcome (in 7.8%). However, medical history (personal and family history) was negative concerning hints for thromboembolic events in more than 80% of patients with a laboratory risk profile for thromboembolic morbidity. No association of APC and factor V testing with the patients' gynecological/obstetric history (e.g., live birth rate, miscarriages) was observed.

Conclusion(S)

### Evaluation and treatment of recurrent pregnancy loss: a committee opinion [^4bf232a4]. Fertility and Sterility (2012). Medium credibility.

Recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL)—definition, prevalence, and evaluation thresholds—recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) is a distinct disorder defined by two or more failed clinical pregnancies, while clinically recognized pregnancy loss occurs in approximately 15–25% of pregnancies. It is estimated that fewer than 5% of women will experience two consecutive miscarriages and only 1% experience three or more. For determining whether evaluation for RPL is appropriate, pregnancy is defined as a clinical pregnancy documented by ultrasonography or histopathological examination, and ideally a threshold of three or more losses should be used for epidemiological studies while clinical evaluation may proceed following two first-trimester pregnancy losses. Self-reported losses by patients may not be accurate, and in one study only 71% of self-reported clinical pregnancy losses could be verified in hospital records.

### Subclinical hypothyroidism in the infertile female population: a guideline [^e5eb28db]. Fertility and Sterility (2024). High credibility.

Thyroid autoimmunity (TAI) in infertile or pregnant women—summary statements and recommendation indicate insufficient evidence for routine screening and mixed associations with miscarriage. There is intermediate-quality and conflicting evidence that is insufficient to suggest an association between thyroid antibodies and miscarriage. There is weak evidence that women with recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) have higher rates of positive thyroid antibodies on the basis of limited case-controlled studies. There is insufficient evidence to recommend screening for TAI in infertile or pregnant women. It is not recommended to screen for TAI in asymptomatic women with infertility or pregnancy. Targeted screening may be considered in women with a history of RPL (strength of evidence C; strength of recommendation weak).

### Can single progesterone concentration predict miscarriage in early pregnant women with threatened miscarriage: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^bd0ed2fc]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

About 25% of pregnant women experience bleeding in the early stage, and half of them eventually progress to pregnancy loss. Currently, neither effective treatment nor prevention strategy is available to manage this condition. Despite some medicines are frequently prescribed in clinical practice including progesterone, the latter seems only to benefit early pregnant women with a history of one or more previous miscarriages and vaginal bleeding.

The vaginal bleeding during the early pregnancy stage is proven to be strongly associated with miscarriage, which is indeed attributed to luteal insufficiency, leading to low progesterone concentration. Progesterone, a critical hormone during pregnancy, reflects the luteal function until 7 weeks of gestation, and thus serves as a biomarker to predict the pregnancy outcome in threatened miscarriage. However, the concentration of progesterone varies largely among individuals and across gestational age. Previously, two meta-analyses indicated that both less than 10 ng/mL and 6.3 ng/mL could predict a non-viable pregnancy in early pregnant women including threatened miscarriage. Nevertheless, it is still unclear whether a single progesterone measurement can predict miscarriage in early pregnant women with threatened miscarriage, because most of studies recruited mixed patients including biochemical pregnancy, ectopic pregnancy and threatened miscarriage.

Therefore, we conduct a diagnostic meta-analysis to evaluate the performance of single progesterone measurement predicting miscarriage in early pregnant women with threatened miscarriage.

### Prevalence and clinical, social, and health care predictors of miscarriage [^ed3630ff]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Spontaneous abortion, also known as early pregnancy loss and miscarriage, typically occurs in the first trimester of gestation. Depending on the data source, these losses are estimated to occur in 10–25% of clinically-recognized pregnancies in developed countries. Approximately 50% of early-term miscarriages are attributed to chromosomal abnormalities – “random numeric chromosome errors” – which influences the conventional wisdom that early-term pregnancy losses occur at random, and that all women are at risk. However, other maternal (and sometimes paternal) characteristics have been identified as risk factors, particularly for recurrent miscarriages, including clinical, social, behavioral, and health factors [,–].

Reliable statistics on both the population prevalence and distribution of these losses early in pregnancy are challenging to estimate. The loss may occur before the woman knows she was pregnant and whether a woman seeks medical attention will depend on the accessibility of services, severity of symptoms, and the woman’s circumstances. Published estimates range from 5% to 52% of pregnancies, with the bulk of the estimates between 13 and 30%. This variation is due in part to small samples, as well as different populations and time periods under study (e.g. upward trends over time are partly due to to increased awareness of pregnancy). In prospective studies, estimates are affected by the specificity and sensitivity of different methods and assays used to detect pregnancy and when in their menstrual cycle or gestation women are enrolled in the study. Retrospective studies use diagnostic codes to identify miscarriages among hospitalized women and interview data for non-hospitalized women, where recall bias can be a particular challenge. Using existing, population-level data that includes both inpatient and outpatient health care utilization may be a cost-effective way to estimate the prevalence of these events.

### The impact of unexplained spontaneous miscarriage history on cycle outcomes in patients undergoing in vitro fertilization: an analysis of 6535 patients [^bf42a56a]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Miscarriage is a common adverse outcome of pregnancy, with a reported prevalence of 12–15% among clinically recognized pregnancies by 20 weeks of gestation. Recurrent miscarriage, as an important part of recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL), defined as two or more miscarriages, not necessarily consecutive, represents a significant health problem. The exact incidence of recurrent miscarriage is difficult to estimate and varies widely between reports, but most studies report that RPL affects 1–5% of all couples attempting conception.

Spontaneous miscarriage following spontaneous pregnancy, especially recurrent miscarriage, potentially results from a complex interplay between parental age, genetic, hormonal, immunological, uterine, and environmental factors [,–]. These explanations allow for treatment interventions in the following pregnancy. Nonetheless, even after a comprehensive evaluation, a cause for recurrent miscarriage is identified in less than 50% of couples. Empirical treatments are usually recommended for unexplained recurrent miscarriage, including emotional support, nutritional optimization, close monitoring, and ultimately rely on natural conception. Most of these treatments show limited effects and offers little benefit to patients. Therefore, at present, unexplained recurrent miscarriage is a frustrating health problem, without effective treatments to improve the live birth rate.

Moreover, the number of previous spontaneous miscarriages is associated with the increased risk of subsequent pregnancy and perinatal complications, including early abortion, preterm birth, and perinatal death, which may also damage fertility. Therefore, even though the empirical therapies are not well defined for their effectiveness, they are still offered for patients with unexplained miscarriage history. Among them, assisted reproductive technique (ART), mainly referring to in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer (IVF-ET), usually serves as the most common treatment option. Meanwhile, patients with unexplained miscarriage history sometimes suffered from concurrent secondary infertility, in which IVF-ET becomes the compelling choice.

To date, whether couples with unexplained miscarriage histories can benefit from IVF-ET treatment is still a controversial issue and under a heated debate. Some studies believe that for patients with unexplained miscarriage history, especially for those diagnosed with RPL, IVF-ET treatment alone cannot improve the pregnancy efficiency, and may even prolong the time of the next pregnancy occurrence. Other studies have shown that, although there are some confounding factors, the implementation of IVF-ET treatment can significantly reduce the miscarriage rate. Moreover, the overall reproductive performance of women with unexplained miscarriage histories who have received IVF-ET treatment is unclarified purposefully and waiting for further investigations.

### Diagnosis of pregnancy and providing options counseling for the adolescent patient [^f7fe4686]. Pediatrics (2017). Medium credibility.

Pregnancy diagnosis—urine and serum human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) testing—states that laboratory test results for pregnancy are likely to be positive before clinical symptoms and physical signs, with testing based on hCG in urine and serum; concentrations increase quickly after implantation, doubling every 2 to 2.5 days and peaking around the ninth week of gestation, and approximately 20% of serum hCG is excreted through the urine. Most pregnancies are diagnosed by urine immunoassays, which can detect hCG by the first day of the missed period, usually at a quantitative hCG value of 25 IU/L. Urine pregnancy testing is highly accurate but the most common cause of a false-positive or false-negative result is human error, so it is essential to carefully follow the test kit manufacturer’s instructions and read the result at exactly the prescribed time. A false-negative result may occur with very low hCG early in pregnancy, dilute urine, or the “hook effect”; if pregnancy is suspected and the urine test is negative, one should confirm proper test performance and, if so, a repeat urine test may be indicated in several days, or a serum pregnancy test may be performed. Qualitative and quantitative serum hCG immunoassays are often not immediately available in clinics and are more expensive than urine tests but can more accurately diagnose an early pregnancy; heterophile antibodies, rheumatoid factors, and some medications may interfere with serum immunoassays.

### Thrombophilia testing: a British Society for Haematology guideline [^1c46240e]. British Journal of Haematology (2022). Medium credibility.

Thrombophilia testing in relation to pregnancy morbidity

A number of mostly retrospective cohort studies have found weak associations between heritable thrombophilia and placentally‐mediated pregnancy complications such as gestational hypertension and pre‐eclampsia;,intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and placental abruption;recurrent first‐trimester pregnancy lossand stillbirth,however the published literature is inconsistent. Moreover, several meta‐analyses have failed to demonstrate a benefit of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) and/or aspirin to improve pregnancy outcomes.,Therefore, guidelines from, for example, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists recommend against testing for heritable thrombophilia in women with previous adverse pregnancy outcomes.

Acquired thrombophilia does appear to be associated with placenta‐mediated pregnancy complications,specifically antiphospholipid antibodies and late fetal loss; lupus anticoagulant with pre‐eclampsia, IUGR and late fetal loss;,,anti‐β2GPI and recurrent miscarriage.Further, miscarriage, stillbirth and neonatal death were shown to be more common in APS women who had had a previous thrombosis compared to APS women who had not. Poorer outcome was also associated with triple positive antibodies.

In women with previous thrombosis and triple positive APS, treatment with LMWH and aspirin is associated with improved pregnancy outcomes.However, in women with APS and a history of previous early (after 20 weeks gestation) onset pre‐eclampsia, LMWH did not appear to confer an additional benefit over aspirin alone.The administration of LMWH to women with APLs and recurrent miscarriage appears to confer a benefit in reducing early pregnancy loss without influencing late obstetric complications.Similar to lack of evidence related to the significance of MTHFR, SERPINE1 variants and PAI‐1 plasma levels in predicting the risk of thrombosis, there is no role of testing these in women with pregnancy morbidities.

Taken together the evidence for the benefit of screening women with previous adverse pregnancy outcomes is limited to screening for antiphospholipid antibodies.

Recommendations

We recommend against heritable thrombophilia screening in women with pregnancy complications, such as recurrent miscarriage or adverse pregnancy outcomes (Grade 2B).
For women with recurrent or late pregnancy loss, screening for antiphospholipid antibodies can be considered as the results aid risk stratification and treatment decisions (Grade 2B).
Antiphospholipid antibody testing should be avoided during pregnancy as the results may not be reliable (Grade 2B).

### Pathology consultation on human chorionic gonadotropin testing for pregnancy assessment [^fe836fd2]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives

To provide clarity on the use of qualitative and quantitative human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) tests for the assessment of pregnancy.

Methods

A case scenario and a brief review of the relevant literature describing clinical and analytical considerations regarding hCG testing are presented.

Results

In pregnancy, hCG is nearly always detectable in serum and urine within 16 days after ovulation. Serial hCG testing is valuable in the evaluation of suspected ectopic pregnancy. hCG assays vary in their analytical specificity, and qualitative tests may be less analytically sensitive than claimed. Erroneous hCG test results can occur for several reasons.

Conclusions

hCG assays are reliable diagnostic tests for pregnancy assessment, but a clear understanding of their limitations is necessary for appropriate result interpretation.

### Preimplantation genetic diagnosis reduces pregnancy loss in women aged 35 years and older with a history of recurrent miscarriages [^558eab18]. Fertility and Sterility (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine whether preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) and transfer of euploid embryos would decrease spontaneous abortion rates in recurrent miscarriage (RM) patients.

Design

Controlled clinical study.

Setting

In vitro fertilization centers and PGD reference laboratory.

Patient(S)

Recurrent-miscarriage patients with three or more prior lost pregnancies with no known etiology.

Intervention(S)

Biopsy of a single blastomere from each day 3 embryo, followed by fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

The rate of spontaneous abortions in RM subjects undergoing PGD were compared with [1] their own a priori expectations and [2] a comparison group of women undergoing PGD for advanced maternal age (> or =35 years).

Result(S)

Before PGD, RM patients had lost 87% (262/301) of their pregnancies, with an expected loss rate of 36.5%. After, they only lost 16.7% pregnancies. This difference was mostly due to reduction in pregnancy loss in the > or =35-years age subgroup, to 12% from an expected 44.5%.

Conclusion(S)

Preimplantation genetic diagnosis aneuploidy screening has a beneficial effect on pregnancy outcome in RM couples, especially those in which the woman is aged > or =35 years. Our data indicate that PGD reduces the risk of miscarriage in RM patients to baseline levels.

### Evaluation and treatment of recurrent pregnancy loss: a committee opinion [^cbf2c11b]. Fertility and Sterility (2012). Medium credibility.

Recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL)—suspected causes and screening are summarized as follows: Cytogenetic causes list 2–5 with recommended screening of balanced reciprocal translocations; antiphospholipid (aPL) syndrome is 8–42 (mean, 15) with recommended screening of lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin IgG or IgM antibody, and anti-β2 glycoprotein I; and anatomic factors are 1.8–37.6 (mean, 12.6) with recommended screening of hysterosalpingography and sonohysterography, while hormonal/metabolic screening lists prolactin, TSH, and hemoglobin A1c and environmental/occupational/personal habits are assessed by history. Supportive scientific evidence includes IgG and IgM antibodies and aPL testing for other phospholipids and β2 glycoprotein I. Controversial scientific evidence includes IgG or IgM anti-annexin A5, anti-factor XII, anti-prothrombin, IgA aPLs; uterine fibroids and polyps; polycystic ovary syndrome and insulin resistance, luteal phase progesterone; and bacterial vaginosis and endocervical infections.

### Recurrent miscarriage in a woman with congenital factor V deficiency: a case report [^d27bc068]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Some other disorders can also lead to bleeding during pregnancy including disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), thrombocytopenia, factor V leiden and liver abnormalities. In order to check the existence of these diseases, D-dimer, fibrin degradation product (FDP), platelet count, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level were checked and they were within normal lab range (Table 2). Finally, test results confirmed congenital FVD in the patient.

Table 2 
Patient’s laboratory data of coagulation, hematologic, metabolic and immunologic factors

Abbreviations: AST Aspartate Aminotransferase, ALT Alanine Aminotransferase, FDP Fibrin Degradation Products, ANA Anti Nuclear Antibody, DRVVT Dilute Russell Viper Venom Time

There are studies supporting the idea of an association between coagulation disorders and pregnancy loss. Diagnosis of FVD and history of two miscarriages in our patient indicate that recurrent miscarriage may correlate with FVD. However, it was essential to investigate other possible causes of recurrent miscarriage in the patient. Several risk factors can contribute to recurrent miscarriage, including chromosomal and gene disorders, anatomical factors, endocrine abnormalities, immunological disorders, infectious diseases, etc. As a result of tests, infections, thyroid problems, diabetes, lupus, and antiphospholipid syndrome were all excluded in the patient (Table 2). Moreover, fetal aneuploidy is the most common cause of first trimester miscarriage. Thus, cytogenetic testing of products of conception was performed in both previous pregnancy losses and revealed no findings suggesting aneuploidy or other chromosomal abnormalities. Therefore, our hypothesis about the relevance between congenital FVD and recurrent miscarriage was strengthened.

Moreover, choosing treatment strategy in pregnant women with FVD is important. To prevent bleeding complications, FFP, solvent-detergent FFP (SD-FFP), platelet transfusion, and recombinant factor VIIa should be considered as available choices. Some studies indicate that FFP administration before and during pregnancy is beneficial to reduce the risk of miscarriage. However, there are a few reports on patients who underwent caesarean delivery and successfully managed by platelet transfusion.

In conclusion, this report and the previous one suggest that FVD can be a possible cause of recurrent miscarriage. Consequently, in patients that common causes of abortions are ruled out by assessment, obstetricians should regard FVD as a suspected diagnosis, even if it is asymptomatic. Early diagnosis is very important since some prescribed drugs for decreasing the risk of miscarriage (e.g. aspirin and heparin) may interfere with blood clotting action and worsen the underlying condition.

Adolescent pregnancy history and counseling—initial assessment—notes that about 5% of all female adolescents 15 through 19 years of age in the United States (more than 550 000) became pregnant, and that the pediatrician should be alert for the possibility of pregnancy and not hesitate to pursue testing. Once pregnancy is suspected, it is important to further explore the patient history and the adolescent’s feelings and actions, with questions such as Has the adolescent been involved in a consensual sexual relationship? Who is/are her partner(s)?, Is there a history of sexual coercion or assault?, Does the adolescent desire a pregnancy?, Whom has she already told about this possible pregnancy? Her parents or guardians? Other adults? Her partner?, Will a pregnancy affect her living situation?, Would a pregnancy change her plans for education or employment?, Has she already considered how she might choose to manage a pregnancy?, Are there social or cultural issues that could influence her management?, What adult in her life would be her greatest support at this time?, If she is not pregnant, would she like to begin a more effective contraceptive method?, and Has the adolescent ever been pregnant previously?

### Why do patients decline amniocentesis? Analysis of factors influencing the decision to refuse invasive prenatal testing [^bbf2a95c]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2018). Low credibility.

In our study, the decision to refuse amniocentesis was made most often by women with primary education; furthermore, primary education turned out to be the only independent predictor of declining invasive prenatal diagnosis on multivariate logistic regression analysis. However, this does not seem to be a universal rule since according to McCoyd, even relatively well-educated and economically stable persons may present with a surprising lack of knowledge and understanding on the purpose of the exam and possibility of fetal diagnosis. During perinatal period, women are particularly vulnerable to anxiety and depressive disorders, and potential problems with their fetuses seem to contribute significantly to this conditions. Patients in whom screening tests showed increased risk for fetal anomaly or revealed an actual defect, are typically devastated and confused. The vast majority of pregnant women do not consider potential problems with their fetuses. Even upon referral to a medical appointment aimed at fetal health assessment, only a small proportion of patients discuss potential risk for a fetal anomaly with their partner or anyone else. This implies that pregnant women display a relatively high level of denial or are just not prepared for possible diagnosis of fetal anomaly. This may explain why upon such diagnosis women are truly shocked and have a sense of betrayal, rather than being “only” surprised or saddened. Pregnancy planning is just one indicator of preparedness for a gestation; the percentage of planned pregnancies in the United States is estimated at 50%. Preparation for pregnancy can be considered a valuable resource for decision-making, especially in a crisis situation, such as detection of a fetal anomaly. Available evidence suggests that under such circumstances, women with unplanned pregnancies may be more prone to decision-making problems. The principal reasons behind undergoing prenatal tests are reassurance and the desire of knowledge about the fetal health. The decision to decline prenatal testing may be driven by personal views on pregnancy termination and the fear for iatrogenic pregnancy loss. Although amniocentesis is associated with an increased risk for miscarriage, it should be stressed that the exact risk has still not been determined and its available estimates vary from 1:100 to 1:1600. In this study, women with a history of at least two miscarriages in previous pregnancies refused invasive prenatal diagnosis significantly more often than other subjects. Furthermore, the history of at least two miscarriages turned out to be an independent significant predictor of declining amniocentesis. The obstetric history of a woman is likely an important determinant of her decision to approve/refuse an invasive procedure. Surprisingly, however, Sharda et al. showed that nearly 50% of women with unfavorable obstetric history and ultrasonographic evidence of soft aneuploidy markers agreed to take risk of amniocentesis rather than having an abnormal child. On the other hand, some women with two or more live children (including one with a genetic disorder) and primigravidas were reluctant to undergo an invasive procedure. Still little is known on the factors that influence maternal decision to accept or decline diagnostic amniocentesis, and most of available data in this matter are not evidence-based or reflect solely personal experiences. Potential determinants of the decision to undergo/refuse invasive prenatal testing include the method of conception, age, parity, consanguinity, family history of congenital anomalies, history of miscarriage, twin gestation, socioeconomic background and religion. In our series, declining amniocentesis did not correlate significantly with maternal age (< 35 years vs. ≥ 35 years), gravidity (< 2 vs. ≥3), marital status (married vs.others) and gestational age at the time of non-invasivescreening (11 vs. 12 vs. 13). Many women who conceived via assisted reproduction technology (ART) are older than 35 years, either due to previous unsuccessful attempts to get pregnant or as a consequence of conscious decision to delay childbearing. Women who undergo in vitro fertilization (IVF) may theoretically be reluctant to diagnostic amniocentesis owing attributed risk of miscarriage. However, some of them may seek additional assurance that their pregnancies are karyotypically normal, owing past history of infertility. How these conflicting factors influencematernal decision to approve/decline prenatal testing is largely unknown. Nevertheless, in our study, all pregnant women with a history of ART procedures and high personalized risk scores for trisomy 21 (N = 7) opted for an invasive testing. Also the patients whose fetuses presented with nuchal translucency values > 2.5 mm and those with personalized risk scores for trisomy 21 greater than 1:100 refused amniocentesis significantly less often than the remaining participants of this study. Patients who did not give their consent for invasive tests can be offered non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT). Rapid advances in NIPT based on cell-free fetal DNA in maternal plasma have now made it possible to identify pregnancies affected by trisomy 21 from 10 weeks of gestation; the blood test provides high accuracy (> 99%) and low false-positive rate (0.1%) in identification of affected pregnancies. NIPT has two key clinical advantages over invasive testing: it does not pose a risk of miscarriage and can be conducted early in pregnancy. However, it should be remembered that NIPT is not currently considered fully diagnostic, and therefore, its positive result needs to be verified by means of an invasive testing. Widespread use of fetal cell-free DNA testing would with no doubt reduce the number of unnecessary invasive tests (amniocentesis and chorionic villi sampling) and eliminate associated risk for miscarriage. Moreover, the use of NIPT may exert a salient effect on pregnant woman’s general attitude to prenatal genetic testing. Many patients who would currently decline prenatal genetic testing would likely opt for performing NIPT.

### Number and sequence of preceding miscarriages and maternal age for the prediction of antiphospholipid syndrome in women with recurrent miscarriage [^38112d78]. Fertility and Sterility (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate the relationship between the number and sequence of preceding miscarriages and antiphospholipid syndrome (APS).

Design

Retrospective cohort study.

Setting

Recurrent miscarriage (RM) clinic.

Patient(S)

Women who attended the RM clinic from 1988 to 2006.

Intervention(S)

None.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Number, type, and sequence of previous pregnancies were compared between women with APS and women with unexplained RM.

Result(S)

A total of 1,719 patients were included; 312 (18%) had APS, and 1,407 (82%) had unexplained RM. The mean maternal age (32.6 years) did not differ between women with and without APS. The median number of miscarriages was three in both groups. A total of 865 women (50%) had a history of at least one live birth, with no difference between the two groups. In both groups, 97% of the women had a history of consecutive miscarriages.

Conclusion(S)

The number of preceding miscarriage, type and sequence of previous pregnancies, and maternal age were not associated with APS in women with RM. There is no increased diagnostic yield for APS after three miscarriages rather than after two miscarriages and no increased diagnostic yield for APS after consecutive miscarriages rather than after nonconsecutive miscarriages. Therefore, APS testing should be considered for all women with two or more miscarriages.

### ACOG practice bulletin. management of recurrent pregnancy loss. number 24, February 2001. (replaces technical bulletin number 212, September 1995). American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists [^83d6be8c]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2002). Low credibility.

Recurrent pregnancy loss is a common clinical problem in reproduction, occurring in approximately 1% of reproductive-aged women. A definite cause is established in no more than 50% of couples, and several alleged causes of recurrent pregnancy loss are controversial. Moreover, in the field of recurrent pregnancy loss, inappropriate emphasis often is given to unproven hypotheses and poorly designed clinical studies. Seeking a solution, some patients and physicians explore less-well-accepted etiologies and empirical or alternative treatments. This bulletin will provide the practitioner with a rational, modern approach to the management of recurrent pregnancy loss. New and controversial etiologies will be presented so that the practitioner can discuss them with couples who have a history of recurrent pregnancy loss.

### Consumer testing for disease risk: ACOG committee opinion summary, number 816 [^206c94f6]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). High credibility.

Direct-to-consumer genetic test result management—referral and confirmatory testing guidance states that clinicians "should be prepared to review these results or refer to a health care professional with appropriate knowledge, training, and experience in interpreting test results." In most circumstances, patients with such results "should be referred to an obstetrician–gynecologist or other health care professional who is skilled in risk assessment" and who can interpret results in context, and "medical intervention typically should wait for confirmatory testing in a clinical laboratory." If pregnancy is relevant, "the potential effects on the fetus are important to discuss," and when testing is pursued, "the consumer should be apprised of risk from screening or susceptibility test results that can neither prove nor eliminate disease potential but may be distressing for consumers."

### Patient self assessment of pregnancy status in the emergency department [^93e31848]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2006). Low credibility.

Objectives

Pregnancy tests are often performed routinely for female emergency department (ED) patients of reproductive age. One major reason is a perception that patients are unreliable in predicting their own pregnancy status. We hypothesised that patients could reliably predict that they were not pregnant.

Methods

The study used a prospective cohort design, in an urban academic ED, from January 19 to May 19, 2004. All patients for whom a pregnancy test was ordered were asked about their sexual history as well as two additional questions: "Do you think you might be pregnant?" and "Is there any chance you could be pregnant?" Patients with already documented pregnancies were excluded.

Results

A total of 474 patients had pregnancy tests performed that met inclusion criteria. Eleven (2.3%) tests were positive. Among patients who answered no to both questions (337), one test (0.3%) was positive (negative predictive value (NPV) 99.7%, likelihood ratio (LR) 0.13 (95% CI, 0.02 to 0.82)). The other historical factor with a high NPV (100%) was not being sexually active (LR not calculable). All pregnancies occurred in patients with gastrointestinal or genitourinary as the chief complaint: this comprised only 56% of the presentations for which tests were ordered.

Conclusion

Sexual history and self assessment can be used as a highly effective predictor of a patient not being pregnant. Given the risks of missed pregnancy in the ED, and low monetary and time cost of pregnancy tests, frequent testing is still recommended in most instances.

### Providing quality family planning services in the United States: recommendations of the U.S. Office of Population Affairs (revised 2024) [^23d15279]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Infertility evaluation—screening thresholds and basic workup for persons attempting pregnancy—states that all persons attempting to achieve pregnancy should be screened for infertility, and evaluation of infertility should be performed for all persons attempting to conceive through penis-in-vagina sex with sperm after 12 months if younger than age 35 years and at 6 months if age 35 years or older, with immediate evaluation or referral for MAR considered for people older than age 40 years or those with a medical history associated with infertility. For persons assigned female at birth (AFAB), a physical examination that includes vital signs; thyroid examination to identify any enlargement, nodule, or tenderness; and integumentary examination for signs of androgen excess should be performed, and genital exams, including pelvic exam, are not required for basic infertility evaluation. Assessment of ovulatory function for people AFAB is often best determined by a thorough menstrual history, and menstrual cycles should be 21–35 days, regular, predictable, and consistent in terms of symptoms and flow; if a patient has a history of oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea, this is sufficient to establish anovulation and warrants further investigation to identify underlying etiology. For individuals assigned male at birth (AMAB), the semen analysis is the first and most simple screen for infertility, and abnormal results should be followed up with a physical exam to assess for infection, varicocele, or other causes of impaired sperm production. Few laboratory tests are needed initially and should be limited to history and physical exam findings, and the following tests should not be ordered routinely unless specifically indicated: prolactin (galactorrhea), estradiol, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), progesterone, endometrial biopsy, thrombophilia testing, karyotype, immunologic testing, adrenal, ovarian reserve function testing, and laparoscopy for unexplained fertility.

Infection—although organisms such as Ureaplasma urealyticum, Mycoplasma hominis, chlamydia, Listeria monocytogenes, Toxoplasma gondii, rubella, cytomegalovirus, and herpes virus have been identified more frequently in women with sporadic miscarriages, there are no convincing data that infections cause RPL; therefore there are no clear indications for routine testing for these organisms in the RPL evaluation, and given the lack of prospective studies linking any infectious agent to recurrent early pregnancy loss, any use of antibiotics is not supported by the evidence.

### What serial hCG can tell you, and cannot tell you, about an early pregnancy [^773dc029]. Fertility and Sterility (2012). Low credibility.

The serial measurement of serum hCG concentrations is an important clinical tool used to differentiate normal from abnormal pregnancies. At hCG values below which ultrasonography can be diagnostic, the comparison of a patient's hCG dynamics to those of established expected curves of rise or fall can aid the clinician in determining when to follow expectantly and when to intervene. Still, this method has some limitations and should never supersede clinical judgment based on symptoms or signs.

### Definition of infertility: a committee opinion [^0d9dea48]. Fertility and Sterility (2023). High credibility.

Infertility—defined as a disease, condition, or status characterized by any of the following—includes the inability to achieve a successful pregnancy based on a patient’s medical, sexual, and reproductive history, age, physical findings, diagnostic testing, or any combination of those factors; the need for medical intervention, including, but not limited to, the use of donor gametes or donor embryos in order to achieve a successful pregnancy either as an individual or with a partner; and, in patients having regular, unprotected intercourse and without any known etiology for either partner suggestive of impaired reproductive ability, evaluation should be initiated at 12 months when the female partner is under 35 years of age and at 6 months when the female partner is 35 years of age or older. Nothing in this definition shall be used to deny or delay treatment to any individual, regardless of relationship status or sexual orientation.

### Diagnostic factors identified in 1020 women with two versus three or more recurrent pregnancy losses [^afdecb7c]. Fertility and Sterility (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine whether the frequency of abnormal results for evidence-based diagnostic tests differed among women with recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) based on the number of prior losses (n = 2, 3, or > or =4) and to determine whether abnormal results for additional investigative diagnostic tests differed in prevalence among women with different numbers of pregnancy losses.

Design

Single-center, retrospective study.

Setting

Patients with RPL at a private practice.

Patient(S)

One thousand twenty women who had two or more consecutive spontaneous pregnancy losses with the same partner.

Intervention(S)

None.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Frequencies of abnormal results for evidence-based diagnostic tests considered definite or probable causes of RPL (karyotyping for parental chromosomal abnormalities; pelvic sonohysterography, hysterosalpingogram, or hysteroscopy for uterine anomalies; immunological tests for lupus anticoagulant and anticardiolipin antibodies; thrombophilic tests for the factor V Leiden mutation; and blood tests for thyroid-stimulating hormone [TSH] and fasting blood glucose). We also measured the frequency of abnormal results for nine additional investigative tests in the same patients (antiphosphatidyl serine antibodies, microbial infection, midluteal P, PRL, functional protein C activity, functional protein S activity, antithrombin activity, fasting homocysteine and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase polymorphisms, and factor II mutation).

Result(S)

The prevalence of abnormal results for evidence-based and investigative diagnostic tests did not differ among women with different numbers of pregnancy losses.

Conclusion(S)

Evaluation of all couples with two, three, or more consecutive miscarriages is recommended.

### Economic impact of using maternal plasma cell-free DNA testing to guide further workup in recurrent pregnancy loss [^5a908280]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2021). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Early pregnancy loss (EPL), defined as a nonviable, intrauterine pregnancy with either an empty gestational sac or a gestational sac containing an embryo or fetus without fetal heart activity within the first 12 6/7 weeks of gestation, occurs in ∼20% of all clinically recognized pregnancies.Recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) is defined by ≥ 2 failed clinical pregnancies,and affects 2%–4% of couples.It is well established that chromosomal anomalies account for 50%–70% of EPL,,,but even in RPL, random aneuploidy is the single most common etiology, accounting for >50% of cases.,,While commonly considered, parental balanced chromosomal rearrangement (such as translocations) leading to unbalanced rearrangements as a cause of pregnancy loss, are detected in only about 4% of RPLs.,Cases of RPL with no chromosomal anomalies may be due to maternal conditions such as autoimmune or endocrine diseases congenital or acquired uterine cavity defects, etc. Understanding the etiology of RPL can potentially guide future management to achieve a successful pregnancy.

The RPL workup recommended by the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) includes parental karyotyping; screening for lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibodies, and anti‐β2 glycoprotein; uterine cavity assessment; and screening for thyroid or prolactin abnormalities.However, given that most RPL are due to random aneuploidy, it is not surprising that in most cases no cause is detected.It has therefore been suggested that chromosomal analysis in products of conception (POCs) should be used to guide RPL workup. If this demonstrates a random aneuploidy, further testing is obviated, which may result in cost‐savings.It was recently reported that combining the ASRM work‐up with POC microarray would lead to identification of an explanation for the miscarriage in 91.8% of RPL cases.Regrettably, the availability of POC has recently declined due to medical management of miscarriage which has superseded surgical evacuation.

Early pregnancy loss, or loss of an intrauterine pregnancy within the first trimester, is encountered commonly in clinical practice. Obstetricians and gynecologists should understand the use of various diagnostic tools to differentiate between viable and nonviable pregnancies and offer the full range of therapeutic options to patients, including expectant, medical, and surgical management. The purpose of this Practice Bulletin is to review diagnostic approaches and describe options for the management of early pregnancy loss.

Recurrent early miscarriages

Recurrent pregnancy loss is defined as three consecutive early miscarriages (before the 10th week of gestation) and should lead to an investigation for underlying pathology, including chromosomal karyotyping in both partners, analysis of factors for thrombophilia including aPL, hormone levels and immunological markers, and also a pelvic examination of the mother. In the second trimester, miscarriage and fetal loss are less likely to be caused by chromosomal abnormalities, whereas factors like structural abnormalities, IUGR, placental insufficiency, infections and cervical insufficiency are more commonly involved.

The persistent presence of LA was confirmed in about 10% of women with a history of recurrent miscarriages in a cohort of 500 women, while aCL IgG and IgM were found in 3.3% and 2.2%, respectively.The prevention of recurrent early miscarriages is the only situation in OAPS where treatment is based on several clinical trials, as discussed later in this review.

Late pregnancy loss

Late pregnancy loss, after 20–22 weeks of gestation (definitions vary between countries, according to the WHO up to 28 weeks), is also referred to as stillbirth. Sometimes stillbirth before 22 weeks of gestation is referred to as a late miscarriage. There is only one study assessing aPL in a cohort of women with stillbirth, comprising 582 cases and demonstrating that aPLs (aCL and anti-β 2 GPI) were positively associated with stillbirths.However, LA was not analysed in this study and positivity of aPL was not confirmed.

### Validation of serum progesterone [^32401e16]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

There is significant interest in developing clinically useful models for risk prognosis of pregnancy complications and outcomes, and to stratify pregnant women as low or high risk. The advantages of serum progesterone as a marker for spontaneous miscarriage in women with threatened miscarriage are three-fold: (1) high reliability for reassuring women at low risk of miscarriage (NPV > 90%), (2) provides clinical guidance for unnecessary progestogen treatments or bed rest, and (3) may prompt mobilization of resources supporting an expectant mother’s psychological wellbeing.

Main findings

Our study was targeted at women presenting with threatened miscarriage in early pregnancy in order to validate a previously suggested serum progesterone cut-off level of <35 nmol/L for predicting risk of spontaneous miscarriage in this high-risk population. In the past, a reliable marker or model for clinical prognosis of pregnancy outcome in women presenting with threatened miscarriage in early pregnancy has not been available. In this study, we have successfully validated the serum progesterone cut-off value of <35 nmol/L (11 ng/ml)—originally identified in a previous study, as a clinically useful predictor of miscarriage prior to week 16 of pregnancy in a temporally different population from the same centre. Using this cut-off, individual patients can be quickly stratified as being at low risk or high risk of spontaneous miscarriage.

### Why do patients decline amniocentesis? Analysis of factors influencing the decision to refuse invasive prenatal testing [^3ce0e8d0]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2018). Low credibility.

Background

In recent years, determination of personalized risk for fetal chromosomal anomalies emerged as an important component of prenatal genetic counseling. Women in whom fetal risk for chromosomal aberrations is elevated are offered further testing. The aim of this study was to identify factors that may influence the decision to refuse invasive prenatal testing aimed at determination of fetal karyotype in a group of patients at increased risk of trisomy 21.

Methods

The analysis included 177 patients with singleton pregnancy, whose personalized risk score for trisomy 21 calculated on the basis of the combined test exceeded 1:300. Diagnostic amniocentesis was performed in 125 patients from this subset, since the remaining 52 women declined invasive prenatal testing. The following factors were analyzed as potential determinants of the decision to refuse amniocentesis: maternal age (≥35 years), gravidity, number of miscarriages in previous pregnancies, educational status, marital status, indications to prenatal testing, gestational age at the time of prenatal testing, personalized risk score for fetal chromosomal aberrations and nuchal translucency (NT) value.

Results

A statistically significant relationship was found between the decision to refuse amniocentesis and the number of previous miscarriages, maternal educational level, NT values and personalized risk score for fetal chromosomal aberrations. Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified primary maternal education and history of more than two miscarriages as independent significant predictors of declining amniocentesis. Women with personalized risk scores for trisomy 21 greater than 1:100 opted out of invasive prenatal diagnosis significantly less often than the remaining participants.

Conclusion

In conclusion, the key role of high quality and accuracy of non-invasive diagnostic tests conducted in the first trimester should be emphasized as personalized risk score for fetal chromosomal aberrations determined based on their results is pivotal for further management of pregnancy. Equally important is to provide the patients with an accurate and comprehensible information about potential benefits and risks of invasive testing.

### Can single progesterone concentration predict miscarriage in early pregnant women with threatened miscarriage: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^ff18dab1]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Main results

This study indicated that single progesterone measurement can act as a biomarker predicting miscarriage in early pregnant women with threatened miscarriage, and the performance was better when the concentration was < 12 ng/mL.

Strengths and limitations

In this updated meta-analysis, we included 12 studies which focused on investigating the progesterone predicting miscarriage in early pregnant women with threatened miscarriage, providing a more robust evaluation compared with the previous one. In addition, as the incidence of threatened miscarriage varies widely across races, regions and countries, the use of sensitivity and specificity to assess progesterone predicting miscarriage in this condition is inappropriate and inaccuracy. Therefore, together with sensitivity and specificity, the LLR was calculated, because the latter had been proposed to be an prefer outcome in diagnostic study.

Also, there are several limitations in this study. First, the threshold interval was relatively wide, lowering the accuracy of estimation. Second, high heterogeneity was observed among studies, leading to increased risk of diagnostic bias and unstable evaluation. Last but not least, a meta-regression analysis can not be performed, due to the absent available data and limited studies.

### Can single progesterone concentration predict miscarriage in early pregnant women with threatened miscarriage: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^c4249e69]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

What ideas does our research provide for clinical applications

Previously, it had been reported that about 50% of women facing threatened miscarriage were affected depressive and anxiety symptomatology. When it comes to the case, they might benefit from an effective treatment or prevention strategy, due to the fear of pregnancy loss, especially for those who had an experience of miscarriage. Unfortunately, there is still absent an effective treatment or prevention strategy. Despite many experimental treatments are frequently prescribed in the real world including exogenous progesterone supplement, the latter had been demonstrated did not improve the clinical outcomes in this subpopulation. As the progesterone concentration < 10 ng/mL can predict a non-viable pregnancy, the issue is how is the prognostic value of progesterone concentration in early pregnant women with threatened miscarriage, especially for those who initially seek medical care and conduct the progesterone measurement. Our findings suggested that serum progesterone < 12 ng/mL at a single measurement can also effectively predict miscarriage in early pregnant patients with threatened miscarriage. Therefore, progesterone, a useful prognostic biomarker, would provide help to make a decision in practice and reduce the anxiety secondary to the threatened miscarriage.

What progress does our research provide for future research?

During the first trimester, serum progesterone levels fluctuate over a 24-hour period, the concentration at a single measurement would be influenced by a short-term pattern of pulses, distribution of the hormone and the diet. Moreover, 7 to 8 weeks is considered to be the stage of the luteal-placental shift, progesterone levels may be plateaus or even decrease trend, attracting the largest attentions during this period with a highest frequency of vaginal bleeding. Whereas few studies explored the performance of progesterone during the period before 7 weeks of gestation. Thus, studies are warranted to be conducted to further validate the prognostic value of progesterone prior 7 weeks of gestation and clarify the optimal time point of single measurement. In addition, the diagnostic performance of progesterone seemed to be little impacted by the exogenous progesterone supplement even thought at a single measurement without specific time point. This deserves to be validated by further studies, given the fact that exogenous progesterone supplement is still widely prescribed in clinical practice.

### Does a short luteal phase correlate with an increased risk of miscarriage? A cohort study [^2e4295db]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Our study sought to address a very common adverse medical event that is rarely studied with the goal of identifying a novel risk factor that can be identified with fertility charting methods and may be modifiable. Additional strengths of our study included our ability to access four unique datasets representing a population of patients from the US and Europe over a 20-year period. Limitations of our study included a smaller than expected sample size that may be underpowered to detect differences among women who experienced a miscarriage as compared to those that did not. Our study was limited to largely white, non-Hispanic women. Finally, we did not have the gestational age at the time of miscarriage for the majority of women. However, statistically the highest rate of miscarriage is highest in the first trimester (> 80%) and we hypothesized that this is where a short luteal phase may have the greatest impact. Future research among more ethnically and racially diverse populations is needed. We had a limited number of cycles preceding the pregnancy cycle to adequately assess the impact of the number of short luteal phases on the outcome of the pregnancy, especially in women with two short luteal phases. Additionally, although women were generally advised to do a pregnancy test if their luteal phase was 16 days or more, if there was a loss prior to that time or women did not do a pregnancy test, it is possible that some early miscarriages were not captured. A larger sample size may have strengthened the study findings. Finally, we did not have information about other potential risk factors or causes for miscarriage, such as autoimmune or endocrine disorders that may have affected miscarriage rates.

Clinical validity—determinants and limitations explain that clinical sensitivity and specificity are functions of how often individuals are identified as true heterozygous for a disease causing variant or not by the genomic assay, and both analytical and clinical validity are of importance because they feed into positive and negative predictive values; NGS-based assays and ancillary methods are likely to have high clinical sensitivity for carrier screening, whereas using published literature, databases, and predictive algorithms to determine variant impact has a lower clinical specificity (higher false-positive rate) in that variants may be erroneously called pathogenic or likely pathogenic, and factors such as allelic and locus heterogeneity may potentially affect clinical specificity.
