## Question

Do statins cause diabetes

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether statins cause diabetes. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the highest-quality evidence quantifying the association between statins and new-onset type 2 diabetes. Then, I should verify whether there is a dose–response relationship and who is most affected. Next, I will examine mechanistic plausibility. After that, I need to weigh the absolute cardiovascular benefits against the absolute diabetes risk. Finally, I should review guideline positions and translate this into practical monitoring and counseling recommendations, including any nuances by statin type or intensity [^117SSQ7z] [^117P5gtj].

> Let me first confirm the magnitude of effect from randomized trials and meta-analyses. Large meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials show a modest increase in incident diabetes with statins: about a 9% relative increase overall in a 2010 Lancet analysis of 13 trials, translating to roughly 1 additional diabetes case per 255 patients treated over 4 years, while preventing about 5.4 vascular events in the same group, which frames the absolute risk as small and the benefit as substantial [^116SsyDW] [^115j5GvN].

> Wait, let me verify the dose–response claim before I overstate it. The 2011 JAMA meta-analysis found that intensive-dose statins confer a further relative increase of about 12% versus moderate-dose regimens, with an absolute excess of approximately 2 additional diabetes cases per 1000 patient-years, reinforcing a dose-dependent signal without negating cardiovascular benefit [^115wxsWc]. Hold on, I should also check the most recent individual participant data meta-analysis; yes, the 2024 CTT analysis confirms a 10% relative increase with low/moderate-intensity statins and a 36% increase with high-intensity statins versus placebo, consistent with a dose–response pattern and a small upward shift in glycemia rather than a categorical disease induction in most users [^117GLZpf] [^111M9EAW].

> I need to ensure I'm characterizing who is most at risk. The excess diabetes diagnoses cluster in people already near the diagnostic threshold for diabetes; approximately 62% of statin-attributed cases occur among those in the top quartile of baseline glycemia, and the relative effect appears broadly similar across baseline risk strata, though absolute risk is higher where baseline diabetes risk is higher, which explains why prediabetes and metabolic risk features amplify the absolute excess [^116dj58u] [^117GLZpf]. Let me also consider observational data in high-risk populations; in the Diabetes Prevention Program, statin use was associated with a 36% higher diabetes risk even after adjustment, supporting clinical relevance in those predisposed to diabetes [^111ui76S] [^114MiLkK].

> Next, I should review mechanisms to assess biological plausibility. Statins inhibit HMG-CoA reductase, which reduces isoprenoid signaling and may impair β-cell function and insulin sensitivity; in vitro and translational work suggests impaired glucose uptake via GLUT1 conformational changes and potential β-cell apoptosis with oxidative stress, while some statins may lower adiponectin, further linking lipid signaling to glycemic control, though clinical heterogeneity exists across agents and populations [^111QhQHC] [^116iFrrr] [^112Y1AUp]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; these mechanistic signals are supportive but not definitive, and inter-statin differences may exist, with some data suggesting pravastatin may have a more neutral glycemic profile, although head-to-head randomized evidence is limited and guidelines still treat this as a class effect with dose dependence [^116R1K2r] [^117SSQ7z].

> I will now examine the benefit–risk balance. In people with diabetes, each 1 mmol/L LDL-C reduction yields about a 21% reduction in major vascular events, with a 9% reduction in all-cause mortality, and similar proportional benefits are seen in those without diabetes, indicating that the cardiovascular gains far outweigh the small absolute increase in diabetes risk in typical clinical contexts [^113qCYxJ]. But wait, what if we focus on primary prevention where diabetes risk might tilt the balance? Even in JUPITER, among participants with diabetes risk factors, rosuvastatin prevented 134 vascular events or deaths for every 54 additional diabetes diagnoses, and among those without diabetes risk factors, benefits occurred with no excess diabetes, underscoring a favorable net clinical outcome despite the modest diabetogenic signal [^117BTcap]. Observational data likewise show higher diabetes incidence but fewer major adverse cardiovascular events and lower in-hospital mortality with statins, reinforcing the net benefit in real-world cohorts [^116tVR8L].

> Next, I should review authoritative guidelines to ensure my interpretation aligns with consensus. The ADA Standards of Care 2025 explicitly notes that statins may modestly increase T2DM risk in high-risk individuals and recommends regular glucose monitoring and reinforcement of diabetes prevention strategies, but advises not to avoid or discontinue statins for this reason, given the cardiovascular benefit [^117P5gtj] [^115hPWnv]. The ACC/AHA 2019 primary prevention guideline recommends moderate-intensity statins for adults 40–75 with diabetes regardless of calculated risk, with consideration of high-intensity therapy when multiple risk factors are present, reflecting strong cardiovascular benefit and integrating the small diabetes risk into shared decision-making rather than as a contraindication [^117SzPjZ] [^115ETCBW]. The Endocrine Society similarly concludes that the benefit–risk ratio favors statins and does not recommend altering indications due to diabetes risk, emphasizing monitoring in those at higher baseline risk [^112uhztJ] [^1134m6Jj].

> Let me translate this into practical clinical steps. For patients at elevated diabetes risk starting statins, I should confirm baseline fasting glucose or HbA1c, counsel on weight management and physical activity, and recheck glycemia within about 3–12 months to detect early shifts, recognizing that most new diagnoses reflect crossing a threshold already close at hand rather than a large pathophysiologic insult [^117SSQ7z] [^112TqeWU]. I should double-check that I'm not overpromising on statin choice; while some observational and network analyses suggest lower diabetes risk with pravastatin, the evidence is indirect and not practice-changing, so agent selection should remain risk-based with attention to potency and tolerability, and any glycemic effects should be managed proactively rather than by withholding indicated statin therapy [^116R1K2r] [^113eTSiE].

> In summary, I need to ensure the bottom line is precise. Yes, statins are associated with a modest, dose-dependent increase in new-onset type 2 diabetes, largely explained by a small upward shift in glycemia that accelerates diagnosis in those already near the threshold, but the absolute risk is low and is consistently outweighed by substantial reductions in myocardial infarction, stroke, and death; therefore, statins should not be avoided or discontinued for fear of diabetes, and instead we should screen, monitor, and mitigate diabetes risk while delivering indicated cardiovascular prevention [^116SsyDW] [^117GLZpf] [^117P5gtj] [^113qCYxJ].

Statins are associated with a **modest increase in new-onset type 2 diabetes** [^116SsyDW], with a relative risk increase of about 9–12% [^116SsyDW] [^115wxsWc] and an absolute risk of ~0.2% per year [^117UAbmc]. The risk is **higher with intensive-dose statins** [^115wxsWc] and in patients with prediabetes, older age, or metabolic syndrome [^114R4qQJ] [^116SsyDW] [^117SSQ7z]. Despite this, the cardiovascular benefits of statins **strongly outweigh the diabetes risk** [^113qCYxJ], and guidelines recommend continuing statins with routine glucose monitoring in high-risk patients [^117SSQ7z] [^117P5gtj].

---

## Evidence from clinical trials and meta-analyses

Multiple large randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and meta-analyses have evaluated the association between statin therapy and incident diabetes:

- **Meta-analysis of 13 RCTs (91,140 participants)**: Statin therapy was associated with a 9% increased risk of incident diabetes (odds ratio [OR] 1.09, 95% CI 1.02–1.17) [^116SsyDW], corresponding to one additional case of diabetes per 255 patients treated over 4 years.

- **Meta-analysis of 5 RCTs (32,752 participants)**: Intensive-dose statin therapy was associated with a 12% increased risk of new-onset diabetes compared with moderate-dose therapy (OR 1.12, 95% CI 1.04–1.22) [^115wxsWc], with an absolute risk increase of 0.2% per year.

- **JUPITER trial**: Rosuvastatin 20 mg daily was associated with a 25% increased risk of incident diabetes compared with placebo (hazard ratio [HR] 1.25, 95% CI 1.05–1.49) [^117BTcap].

- **Individual participant data meta-analysis (2024)**: Low/moderate-intensity statins increased diabetes risk by 10% (rate ratio [RR] 1.10, 95% CI 1.04–1.16), while high-intensity statins increased risk by 36% (RR 1.36, 95% CI 1.25–1.48) [^117GLZpf].

---

## Risk factors for statin-associated diabetes

Certain patient characteristics **increase the risk** of developing diabetes with statin therapy:

- **Prediabetes**: Patients with impaired fasting glucose or impaired glucose tolerance are at higher risk [^114R4qQJ].

- **Age**: Older patients have a higher risk of statin-associated diabetes [^116SsyDW].

- **Metabolic syndrome**: Obesity, hypertension, and dyslipidemia increase risk [^117SSQ7z].

- **Statin intensity**: Higher-intensity statins (e.g. atorvastatin 80 mg, rosuvastatin 20 mg) confer greater risk than lower-intensity regimens [^115wxsWc].

---

## Mechanisms underlying statin-induced diabetes

Several **biological mechanisms** have been proposed to explain the diabetogenic effect of statins:

- **Impaired insulin secretion**: Statins may inhibit β-cell function, reducing insulin secretion [^115dq2Vt].

- **Insulin resistance**: Statins may induce insulin resistance through inflammatory pathways [^115dq2Vt].

- **Glucose uptake inhibition**: Statins have been shown to impair glucose uptake in human cells, potentially contributing to hyperglycemia [^116iFrrr].

---

## Clinical significance and management

Despite the modest increase in diabetes risk, the **cardiovascular benefits of statins are substantial** [^113qCYxJ] and generally outweigh the diabetes risk [^117BTcap]. For example, in the JUPITER trial, statin therapy prevented 134 cardiovascular events or deaths for every 54 new cases of diabetes [^117BTcap]. Guidelines recommend **continuing statin therapy** [^117SSQ7z] while monitoring glucose status, especially in high-risk patients [^117P5gtj]. Routine glucose monitoring is advised for patients with prediabetes or other diabetes risk factors [^115hPWnv].

## Summary of evidence

| **Study type** | **Findings** | **Clinical significance** |
|-|-|-|
| Meta-analysis of 13 RCTs | 9% increased diabetes risk (OR 1.09) | Modest increase; 1 extra case per 255 patients over 4 years |
| Meta-analysis of 5 RCTs | 12% increased risk with intensive-dose statins (OR 1.12) | Dose-dependent effect; 0.2% absolute risk increase per year |
| JUPITER trial | 25% increased risk with rosuvastatin (HR 1.25) | Significant increase in high-risk population |

Statins are associated with a **modest increase in new-onset type 2 diabetes**, particularly with intensive dosing and in patients with predisposing risk factors. The cardiovascular benefits of statins **strongly outweigh the diabetes risk**, and guidelines recommend continuing statin therapy with routine glucose monitoring in high-risk patients [^117P5gtj].

### American diabetes association indications for statins in diabetes: is there evidence? [^113SA2Nq]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

INTRODUCTION

The American Diabetes Association (ADA) standards of care for diabetes state that statin therapy should be initiated in individuals with diabetes and other cardiovascular risk factors with a target LDL cholesterol of < 100 mg/dl. Furthermore, a possible target LDL of < 70 mg/dl is stated in patients with diabetes and cardiovascular disease. In this mini-review, we examine the evidence that exists regarding LDL cholesterol–based treatment goals in individuals with diabetes. From our review of the current literature, it is evident that the majority of clinical trials were designed using a fixed dose of statins and not in an LDL cholesterol–based "treat-to-target" approach (thus differing from the common design of blood glucose control trials). This leads us to reassess the current guidelines with special emphasis on the very-low-risk and very-high-risk individuals with diabetes, where the evidence is less robust. We conclude that in this subset of individuals with diabetes, statin therapy should be based on the existing evidence and prescribed in a fixed-dose manner.

CONCLUSIONS

Both in primary prevention and in the very-high-risk patients, it seems that statins reduce major cardiovascular events irrespective (at least in part) of the baseline and post-therapy LDL levels achieved. Should statins be generally prescribed in a fixed-dose manner? We would not go so far as to suggest that, but indeed, in the diabetic individual whose LDL cholesterol is seemingly within normal limits, this should be considered. The indication for statin therapy in diabetic individuals should not rely solely on LDL levels but on the inherent cardiovascular risk that accompanies this disease (even if goal LDL levels are met).

We believe that the standards of care for individuals with diabetes should mirror the evidence. Replacing a fixed-dose statin trial scheme with a treat-to-target LDL guideline is controversial. This inherent problem of the current guidelines should be amended. Evidence based on "hard" outcome trials of statin use should guide our treatment goals and considerations, not epidemiologic or extrapolated LDL-based data.

### Is statin-induced diabetes clinically relevant? A comprehensive review of the literature [^113Axsh9]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

In those predisposed to the development of diabetes (the insulin resistant, obese and older patients) statins may increase the risk of developing diabetes. Despite the fact that the conversion to diabetes is generated from post hoc analyses, it seems to be a class effect with a dose-response relationship. However, statins have not been clearly shown to increase diabetic microvascular complications (retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy). Thus, the clinical significance of increased glucose levels in patients treated on statins is uncertain. While the exact mechanism for how statins increase the risk of diabetes is unknown, a possible explanation is through a reduction in adiponectin levels. Despite the fact that higher statin doses are more likely to lead to new-onset diabetes, for every case of diabetes caused, there are approximately three cardiovascular events reduced with high dose versus moderate dose statin therapy. Overall, the small risk of developing type 2 diabetes with statin therapy is far outweighed by the potential of statins to decrease cardiac events.

A statin is first-line drug therapy for dyslipidemia. Clinical trial data suggest there is an increase in the incidence of new-onset type 2 diabetes mellitus with statin use. The National Lipid Association (NLA) Statin Diabetes Safety Task Force concluded that the cardiovascular benefit of statin therapy outweighs the risk for developing diabetes. The NLA panel advocated following the standards of care from the American Diabetes Association for screening and diagnosis of diabetes, and emphasized the importance of lifestyle modification. This article summarizes NLA's review of the evidence, expanding it to include recent results, and outlines the clinical recommendations.

CHOLESTEROL REDUCTION AND CARDIOVASCULAR RISK REDUCTION IN DIABETIC PATIENTS

The vast majority of clinical trials examining cholesterol reduction as a means to reduce cardiovascular risk were performed using HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins). Only three trials recruited diabetic patients exclusively, but some other trials included sufficient diabetic patients to facilitate prespecified or post hoc analyses of the effect of statins in these patients.

### Effects of statin therapy on diagnoses of new-onset diabetes and worsening glycaemia in large-scale randomised blinded statin trials: an individual participant data meta-analysis [^114uQ7E2]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of death worldwide, and LDL cholesterol is a major causal risk factor. Diabetes substantially increases the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Randomised controlled trials have shown that prolonged reduction of LDL cholesterol concentrations with a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG Co-A) reductase inhibitor (ie, a statin) reduces the incidence of myocardial infarction and ischaemic stroke by about a quarter for every 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL cholesterol, with consistent effects in individuals with and without diabetes.

Statins have few confirmed adverse effects, but meta-analyses of summary data in published reports from large randomised controlled trials of statin therapy indicated that standard statin regimens increased the risk of new-onset diabetes by about 10% compared with placebo or usual careand that more intensive statin regimens produced a further 10% relative increase in risk. However, due to the limited information available for these meta-analyses of summary data, assessment of the effects of statin therapy on the risk of developing new diabetes is incomplete. In particular, little is known about which types of people are at particularly high risk of developing diabetes due to a statin, the timing of any excess risk after commencing therapy, or the effects of statin therapy on glycaemic control in people with known diabetes.

To provide insights into these and related questions, we sought individual participant data on all recorded diabetes-related adverse events, treatments for diabetes, and measures of glycaemia recorded within the large, long-term, double-blind, randomised controlled trials of statin therapy that participate in the Cholesterol Treatment Trialists' (CTT) Collaboration.

### Diabetes and cardiovascular disease: when it comes to lipids, statins are all you need [^114xCQes]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

LDL cholesterol is the major risk factor for cardiovascular complications in diabetic patients. Statins significantly reduce cardiovascular risk in diabetic patients. Starting statin therapy before diabetes develops and treating to lower LDL cholesterol targets than is currently recommended may reduce risk even further. There is no evidence that other antilipidemic agents improve clinical outcomes.

### Statins impair glucose uptake in human cells [^111oZ2rD]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2014). Medium credibility.

Further studies defining the risks of statin-induced diabetes or glycemic control in patients with diabetes are necessary. However, the overwhelming benefit of statins in reducing cardiovascular events seems to supersede the small increase in the relative risk of developing diabetes. More intense vigilance of fasting glucose levels seems to be a reasonable approach in statin users. Elucidation of the molecular mechanisms of statin-induced effects should be continued. The results of these studies can shed light on development of novel approaches mitigating negative consequences of statin treatment or development of novel therapeutic approaches for cardiovascular diseases in high-risk patients or patients with diabetes.

Table 1
ADA evidence grading system for clinical practice recommendations

These guidelines are based on numerous trials showing a benefit for statin therapy both as primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease and mortality. Trials like the Collaborative Atorvastatin Diabetes Study (CARDS), proved beyond doubt that patients with type 2 diabetes and other risk factors for CVD should be treated with a statin, apparently disregarding their initial LDL cholesterol level. However, most of these trials did not set a goal LDL cholesterol level for treatment but examined the effect of a predetermined statin dose on the outcome. Extrapolated from these trials and from epidemiologic data, a goal LDL of 100 mg% seems adequate for the majority of patients. Yet because of the problematic interpretation of clinical trial data that was not inherent in its basic structure, alternative treatment goals have arisen, including a reduction of LDL by 40% (in patients where LDL reduction could not reach the 100 mg% goal) or a reduction below 70 mg% (in very-high-risk patients — those with prior cardiovascular disease or acute coronary syndromes).

Some questions are raised from these guidelines. First, the overall efficacy of statin use for primary prevention raises the question who should not get a statin, i.e. what is the evidence for their use as primary prevention in diabetic individuals. Should a statin be given on an LDL-based treat-to-target goal (as stated in the guidelines, reduce the LDL below 100 mg%), existence of other vascular risk factors, age, or regardless of the measured cholesterol at predetermined doses (similar to current use of aspirin).

The second question is what is the evidence for the target LDL in secondary prevention in high-risk diabetic individuals — how aggressive should we be, and should we limit ourselves to an LDL-targeted therapy versus a comprehensive high-dose statin strategy. Again there is the question of the target LDL versus the "evidence-based" fixed dose?

### The extent to which statins have improved cardiovascular outcomes: lessons from randomized trials and observational studies of "real world" practice in people with diabetes [^115PBRJ8]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Statins are the mainstay of therapy for cardiovascular risk reduction in patients with diabetes mellitus. It is estimated that there are more than half a billion patients with diabetes mellitus worldwide and the numbers of prevalent cases of diabetes are expected to increase in both developed and developing countries in the next decade. Statins reduce risk of mortality and morbidity mainly by reducing blood low density cholesterol. Statins, along with other medical treatments, are responsible for about half of the decrease in cardiovascular mortality over the past several decades. Multiple clinical trials have found evidence for statin use in patients with diabetes, for both primary prevention and secondary prevention. The benefit of statins in patients with coronary heart disease and diabetes in terms of absolute risk reduction is twice as much as compared to the risk in patients with coronary heart disease but no diabetes. The proportion of patients with diabetes treated with statins has increased steadily over the past few decades with concurrent decrease in cardiovascular deaths in this high-risk population. However, there are significant unmet needs in cardiovascular risk reduction, due to underutilization of statins and due to residual cardiovascular risk despite maximal statin therapy. Future strategies in population risk reduction in diabetics should include maximal statin therapy, additional treatment with nonstatin therapy and new paradigms of prevention with early intervention with shorter, more intensive therapy to potentially "reverse" atherosclerosis with goals of reducing clinical cardiovascular disease later in life.

### Statins for primary prevention in type 2 diabetes [^112qGVwJ]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2006). Low credibility.

At least 1 in 40 people in the UK have type 2 diabetes mellitus, and the prevalence is increasing. Such people are more likely than others to develop, and to die from, cardiovascular disease. Statin therapy helps to prevent cardiovascular disease events among patients at increased risk, with or without diabetes, and is standard treatment for patients needing secondary prevention. Here we discuss whether statins should be used routinely for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in patients with type 2 diabetes irrespective of other risk factors.

### Statin use and risk of developing diabetes: results from the diabetes prevention program [^111ui76S]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2017). Medium credibility.

Objective

Several clinical trials of cardiovascular disease prevention with statins have reported increased risk of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) with statin therapy. However, participants in these studies were at relatively low risk for diabetes. Further, diabetes was often based on self-report and was not the primary outcome. It is unknown whether statins similarly modify diabetes risk in higher risk populations.

Research design and methods

During the Diabetes Prevention Program Outcomes Study (n = 3234), the long-term follow-up to a randomized clinical trial of interventions to prevent T2DM, incident diabetes was assessed by annual 75 g oral glucose tolerance testing and semiannual fasting glucose. Lipid profile was measured annually, with statin treatment determined by a participant's own physician outside of the protocol. Statin use was assessed at baseline and semiannual visits.

Results

At 10 years, the cumulative incidence of statin initiation prior to diabetes diagnosis was 33%–37% among the randomized treatment groups (p = 0.36). Statin use was associated with greater diabetes risk irrespective of treatment group, with pooled HR (95% CI) for incident diabetes of 1.36 (1.17 to 1.58). This risk was not materially altered by adjustment for baseline diabetes risk factors and potential confounders related to indications for statin therapy.

Conclusions

In this population at high risk for diabetes, we observed significantly higher rates of diabetes with statin therapy in all three treatment groups. Confounding by indication for statin use does not appear to explain this relationship. The effect of statins to increase diabetes risk appears to extend to populations at high risk for diabetes.

### Statins and risk of incident diabetes: a collaborative meta-analysis of randomised statin trials [^116SsyDW]. Lancet (2010). Excellent credibility.

Background

Trials of statin therapy have had conflicting findings on the risk of development of diabetes mellitus in patients given statins. We aimed to establish by a meta-analysis of published and unpublished data whether any relation exists between statin use and development of diabetes.

Methods

We searched Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from 1994 to 2009, for randomised controlled endpoint trials of statins. We included only trials with more than 1000 patients, with identical follow-up in both groups and duration of more than 1 year. We excluded trials of patients with organ transplants or who needed haemodialysis. We used the I(2) statistic to measure heterogeneity between trials and calculated risk estimates for incident diabetes with random-effect meta-analysis.

Findings

We identified 13 statin trials with 91 140 participants, of whom 4278 (2226 assigned statins and 2052 assigned control treatment) developed diabetes during a mean of 4 years. Statin therapy was associated with a 9% increased risk for incident diabetes (odds ratio [OR] 1.09; 95% CI 1.02–1.17), with little heterogeneity (I(2) = 11%) between trials. Meta-regression showed that risk of development of diabetes with statins was highest in trials with older participants, but neither baseline body-mass index nor change in LDL-cholesterol concentrations accounted for residual variation in risk. Treatment of 255 (95% CI 150–852) patients with statins for 4 years resulted in one extra case of diabetes.

Interpretation

Statin therapy is associated with a slightly increased risk of development of diabetes, but the risk is low both in absolute terms and when compared with the reduction in coronary events. Clinical practice in patients with moderate or high cardiovascular risk or existing cardiovascular disease should not change.

Funding

None.

### An assessment by the statin diabetes safety task force: 2014 update [^117W8o15]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2014). Low credibility.

Statin therapy reduces the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, and cardiovascular death by 25% to 30% in primary as well as secondary prevention patients. Thus, statins are the pharmacologic therapy of choice for the management of high blood cholesterol levels. Prompted by examination of clinical trial data suggesting a modest, but statistically significant, increase in the incidence of new-onset type 2 diabetes mellitus with statin use, the US Food and Drug Administration in 2012 added a statement to the labels of statin medications indicating that increases in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C) and fasting glucose levels have been reported with statin use. This labeling change has raised questions among clinicians regarding the relative benefits and risks of statin use, both among patients with diabetes mellitus and among those with diabetes risk factors. This 2014 report from the Diabetes Subpanel of the National Lipid Association Expert Panel on Statin Safety reviews the published evidence relating statin use to the hazard for diabetes mellitus or worsening glycemia, examines potential mechanisms that may mediate the relationship between statin use and diabetes mellitus risk, and suggests future research efforts. Given the well-established benefits of statin therapy in the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular events among those with indications for treatment, no changes to clinical practice are recommended other than the measurement of HbA1C or fasting glucose in those deemed to also be at elevated diabetes risk after initiating statin therapy, and potentially before initiation in selected patients considered to be at elevated risk of developing diabetes. The panel advocates following recommendations from the American Diabetes Association, or other relevant guidelines if outside the United States, for screening and diagnosis as well as lifestyle modification for prevention or delay of diabetes mellitus in those with prediabetes or other risk factors.

### 2019 ACC / AHA guideline on the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines [^117SzPjZ]. Circulation (2019). High credibility.

ACC/AHA 2019 primary prevention — statins in diabetes states that most patients 40 to 75 years of age with diabetes are at intermediate or high risk (PCE ≥ 7.5% 10-year risk) of ASCVD events, and three of 4 double-blinded primary-prevention RCTs of moderate statin therapy in this age range showed significant reductions in ASCVD events. A meta-analysis found moderate-intensity statin therapy was associated with a risk reduction of 25%, similar to people without diabetes and with no apparent difference between type 1 diabetes mellitus and T2DM; therefore, moderate-intensity statin therapy is indicated for primary prevention in patients 40 to 75 years of age with diabetes. Residual risk remained high in trials (e.g., 8.5% had major cardiovascular events in 3.8 years), no RCTs of high-intensity statin therapy have been carried out exclusively in diabetes, and high-intensity statin therapy is preferred in patients with diabetes as they develop risk modifiers.

### Statin-induced diabetes: will it change clinical practice? [^112Y1AUp]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Is the association between statin use and new-onset diabetes plausible? Many mechanistic and experimental studies, mostly with lipophilic statins, support this association. Atorvastatin, but not pravastatin, decreases glucose uptake in adipocyte cell lines and is associated with an increase in A1C in hypercholesterolemic patients. Simvastatin, but not pravastatin, was shown to decrease insulin sensitivity and adiponectin levels in a small randomized placebo-controlled study. Simvastatin and atorvastatin, but not pravastatin, have been shown to decrease insulin secretion in β-cells. On the other hand, a short-term clinical trial comparing rosuvastatin with atorvastatin in subjects with metabolic syndrome showed no significant differences in fasting glucose and in homeostasis model assessment–insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) at 6 weeks between the statins and placebo groups. The inhibition of isoprenoid synthesis may explain some of the dysglycemic effects observed with statins.

### Drug-induced diabetes mellitus: evidence for statins and other drugs affecting glucose metabolism [^113yV2P8]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2016). Low credibility.

Abnormalities of glucose metabolism and glucose tolerance, either because of a reduction in tissue sensitivity to insulin (e.g., in liver, skeletal muscle, and adipose tissues) and/or a reduction in pancreatic insulin secretion, are associated with a number of unwanted health outcomes. Even small increases in circulating glucose levels (often described as dysglycemia or prediabetes) may confer an increased risk of cardiovascular (CV) disease and progression to overt type 2 diabetes. A number of drug therapies, many of them used long term in chronic disease management, have adverse effects on glucose metabolism, diabetes risk, and glycemic control among patients with preexisting diabetes. In this study, we review the evidence, underlying mechanisms, and the clinical significance of drug-related adverse effects on glucose metabolism.

2018 Cholesterol Clinical Practice Guidelines — diabetes mellitus and statins note that evidence indicates that statins modestly increase the risk of incident or statin-associated new-onset diabetes mellitus in individuals with predisposing risk factors, components of the metabolic syndrome, and higher-intensity statin use; the specific mechanisms remain unclear and it is unlikely that statins directly cause diabetes mellitus; because the benefits of statin therapy are shown to outweigh the risks of new-onset diabetes mellitus, the possibility of incident diabetes mellitus should not be a contraindication to statin therapy or indication for statin discontinuation; in individuals at increased risk of both ASCVD and incident diabetes mellitus, it is recommended that counseling based on the ADA Prevention approach be provided, encouraging regular moderate physical activity, maintaining a healthy dietary pattern, and sustaining modest weight loss.

### The diabetogenic action of statins-mechanisms and clinical implications [^111QhQHC]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2016). Medium credibility.

Treatment with statins has transformed primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD), including thrombotic stroke. Evidence-based data demonstrate the benefits and safety of statin therapy and help to guide clinicians in the management of populations at high risk of CVD. Nevertheless, clinical trials, meta-analyses and observational studies highlight a 10–12% increase in new-onset diabetes mellitus (NODM) among patients receiving statins. The risk further increases with intensive therapy and among individuals with known risk factors for NODM. Mechanisms underpinning this effect are not yet fully understood; however, Mendelian randomization studies suggest that they are related to lowered activity of HMG-CoA reductase, the target of statin therapy. In vitro research indicates that statins potentially impair β-cell function and decrease insulin sensitivity but how these findings relate to patients is unknown. In the clinic, statins should be prescribed on the basis of CVD risk and individual patient characteristics. In addition, diet and lifestyle interventions should be emphasized to help mitigate the risk of NODM. Individuals who develop NODM while taking statins do not exhibit increased microvascular disease, which is reassuring. In diabetes mellitus of long duration, the effect of statins on glycaemic control is small and unlikely to be clinically important.

### Balancing primary prevention and statin-induced diabetes mellitus prevention [^112huQEg]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

Diabetes mellitus (DM), a modern-day epidemic, is a significant risk factor for cardiovascular disease. It is believed that statins elevate the risk of incident DM. Multiple trials were suggestive of the hyperglycemic effect of long-term statin use. This has prompted the Food and Drug Administration to include the risk of DM in the product label of statins. New-onset DM with statin use is biologically plausible and can be explained based on the multiple pathways in glucose metabolism affected by statins. Most pivotal clinical trials on statins were not powered to adequately assess the risk of incident DM with statin use, and the results from multiple meta-analyses are mixed. Currently, the US Preventive Services Task Force recommend the use of statins for primary prevention in patients with at least 1 cardiovascular risk factor and a 10-year risk of > 7.5%. With the new American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines, the number of patients eligible for statin therapy has increased exponentially, which also calls for caution and increased vigilance in prescribing physicians regarding the controversies surrounding statin use. This article aims to highlight the existing data on statin use for primary prevention in diabetics and nondiabetics and the association of statins use with new-onset DM and its postulated mechanisms.

### Statin use and risk of developing diabetes: results from the diabetes prevention program [^114MiLkK]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2017). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The health benefits of the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (HMG)-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors ('statin' medications) are thought to extend beyond their cholesterol-lowering properties. Such pleiotropic actions of statins may include favorable effects on systemic inflammation, endothelial function and oxidative stress, important mechanisms involved in the etiology of cardiometabolic diseases. These effects might be predicted to reduce diabetes risk; instead, accumulating evidence suggests that the use of statins may increase the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Following an initial publication reporting this observation, meta-analyses of randomized clinical trials of lipid-lowering with statins have confirmed this effect, and suggest that statin treatment is associated with a small increase, approximately 10%–12%, in the risk of incident diabetes compared with placebo, although not all such analyses find increases in diabetes risk.

In these cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention trials, diabetes was not the primary outcome, diabetes ascertainment was not always based on laboratory testing, and the absolute risk of developing diabetes was relatively low in the study populations. These factors may have limited the sensitivity of the evaluations for observing effects of statins on diabetes incidence. Diabetogenic effects of statins may be more important among individuals with higher risk of diabetes. In a post-hoc analysis of two of the studies contributing to the meta-analyses, the elevated risk appeared to be focused on the subset of study participants who had pre-diabetes based on elevated glucose readings. We therefore conducted an analysis to evaluate the statin–diabetes association using data from the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP), which studied a cohort of overweight and obese individuals at high risk for diabetes, followed specifically for incident diabetes.

### Efficacy of cholesterol-lowering therapy in 18, 686 people with diabetes in 14 randomised trials of statins: a meta-analysis [^113qCYxJ]. Lancet (2008). Excellent credibility.

Background

Although statin therapy reduces the risk of occlusive vascular events in people with diabetes mellitus, there is uncertainty about the effects on particular outcomes and whether such effects depend on the type of diabetes, lipid profile, or other factors. We undertook a prospective meta-analysis to help resolve these uncertainties.

Methods

We analysed data from 18 686 individuals with diabetes (1466 with type 1 and 17,220 with type 2) in the context of a further 71,370 without diabetes in 14 randomised trials of statin therapy. Weighted estimates were obtained of effects on clinical outcomes per 1.0 mmol/L reduction in LDL cholesterol.

Findings

During a mean follow-up of 4.3 years, there were 3247 major vascular events in people with diabetes. There was a 9% proportional reduction in all-cause mortality per mmol/L reduction in LDL cholesterol in participants with diabetes (rate ratio [RR] 0.91, 99% CI 0.82–1.01; p = 0.02), which was similar to the 13% reduction in those without diabetes (0.87, 0.82–0.92; p < 0.0001). This finding reflected a significant reduction in vascular mortality (0.87, 0.76–1.00; p = 0.008) and no effect on non-vascular mortality (0.97, 0.82–1.16; p = 0.7) in participants with diabetes. There was a significant 21% proportional reduction in major vascular events per mmol/L reduction in LDL cholesterol in people with diabetes (0.79, 0.72–0.86; p < 0.0001), which was similar to the effect observed in those without diabetes (0.79, 0.76–0.82; p < 0.0001). In diabetic participants there were reductions in myocardial infarction or coronary death (0.78, 0.69–0.87; p < 0.0001), coronary revascularisation (0.75, 0.64–0.88; p < 0.0001), and stroke (0.79, 0.67–0.93; p = 0.0002). Among people with diabetes the proportional effects of statin therapy were similar irrespective of whether there was a prior history of vascular disease and irrespective of other baseline characteristics. After 5 years, 42 (95% CI 30–55) fewer people with diabetes had major vascular events per 1000 allocated statin therapy.

Interpretation

Statin therapy should be considered for all diabetic individuals who are at sufficiently high risk of vascular events.

Cardiovascular disease and risk management — diabetes risk with statin use shows a small absolute increase and low absolute harm: over 5 years of follow-up, 1.2% on placebo versus 1.5% on rosuvastatin developed diabetes; a meta-analysis of 13 randomized statin trials with 91,140 participants found an odds ratio of 1.09 for new diabetes, such that treating 255 individuals with statins for 4 years resulted in one additional case of diabetes while simultaneously preventing 5.4 vascular events among these 255 individuals.

### Statin-induced risk of diabetes does not reduce cardiovascular benefits in primary prevention: a 6-year propensity-score matched study in a large population [^114WtfTu]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Statins have few confirmed adverse effects but recent meta-analyses of large randomized controlled trials (RCT) suggest that standard regimens may increase the risk of new-onset type 2 diabetes (T2D) by about 10% compared to placebo or usual care and more intensive statin regimens produced a further 10% relative increase in risk. In order to provide insights on which types of patients are at particularly high risk of developing T2D due to statin treatment, the timing of any excess risk after commencing therapy, or the effects of statin therapy on glycemic control in people with diabetes, the Cholesterol Treatment Trialists' (CTT) Collaboration sought individual participant data on all recorded diabetes-related adverse events, treatments for diabetes, and measures of glycemia recorded within their large, long-term, double-blind RCTs of statin therapy. They found that statins cause a moderate dose-dependent increase in new diagnoses of T2D that is consistent with a small upwards shift in glycemia, mainly in people with baseline glycemic markers that are close to the diagnostic threshold for diabetes.

More recently, Lee and coworkers performed a systematic review and individual patient data meta-analysis from RCTs evaluating the long-term efficacy and safety of an alternative LDL cholesterol–lowering strategy compared with a high-intensity statin strategy in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular (CV) disease (ASCVD), and observed that also the alternative strategy group had an increase in the rate of new-onset diabetes, but smaller than with high intensity statins.

However, these analyses primarily included studies involving patients with established ASCVD, making it unclear whether statins also increase the risk of new-onset T2D in the context of primary prevention; it also remains uncertain whether any potential adverse effect of statins on CV risk due to this phenomenon is fully offset by the overall reduction in CV events observed with statin therapy, as suggested in secondary prevention populations.

### Do statins lower testosterone and does it matter? [^115wyyd1]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Drugs are two-sided swords and statins are no exception. Schooling et al. demonstrate that, on average, statins produce small, but statistically significant, decreases in testosterone. They appropriately emphasize that the clinical significance of their observations is unclear but suggest that changes in testosterone might be related to the benefits of therapy as well as the risks, such as the increased chance of diabetes mellitus. Their findings and hypotheses are noteworthy. However, we believe this represents another example of the limitations in the published summaries of drug effects. How do we know all changes induced by drugs are normally distributed? Some may be affected much more than others. Moreover, the confidence intervals of a meta-analysis describe the variance of the mean effect, not the range of effects, and while the mean change characterizes the impact of a drug on a group of patients, the range more fully characterizes its effects on individuals. We treat individuals not groups. Averages do not disclose enough about the risks and benefits of drugs. See related research article here http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7015/11/57.

### Meta-analysis of impact of different types and doses of statins on new-onset diabetes mellitus [^116R1K2r]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2013). Low credibility.

Recent reports indicate that statins are associated with an increased risk for new-onset diabetes mellitus (DM) compared with placebo and that this relation is dose dependent. The aim of this study was to perform a comprehensive network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the impact of different types and doses of statins on new-onset DM. RCTs comparing different types and doses of statins with placebo were searched for using the MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane databases. A search of RCTs pertinent to this meta-analysis covering the period from November 1994 to October 2012 was conducted by 2 independent investigators using the MEDLINE, Cochrane, Google Scholar, and Embase databases as well as abstracts and presentations from major cardiovascular meetings. Seventeen RCTs reporting the incidence of new-onset DM during statin treatment and including a total of 113,394 patients were identified. The RCTs compared either a statin versus placebo or high-dose versus moderate-dose statin therapy. Among different statins, pravastatin 40 mg/day was associated with the lowest risk for new-onset DM compared with placebo (odds ratio 1.07, 95% credible interval 0.86 to 1.30). Conversely, rosuvastatin 20 mg/day was numerically associated with 25% increased risk for DM compared with placebo (odds ratio 1.25, 95% credible interval 0.82 to 1.90). The impact on DM appeared to be intermediate with atorvastatin 80 mg/day compared with placebo (odds ratio 1.15, 95% credible interval 0.90 to 1.50). These findings were replicated at moderate doses. In conclusion, different types and doses of statins show different potential to increase the incidence of DM.

### Statin therapy and risk of developing type 2 diabetes: a meta-analysis [^115nxHWu]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

The role of statins in primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD), including among patients with type 2 diabetes, is well established. However, the relationship of statin therapy to incident type 2 diabetes is controversial. In the first study that evaluated this association using the West of Scotland Coronary Prevention Study (WOSCOPS) published in 2001, pravastatin at 40 mg/day was reported to be associated with a 30% risk reduction for incident diabetes, although the upper bound of the 95% CI for that observation was 0.99. The WOSCOPS, however, required an increase in fasting glucose ≥ 36 mg/dl above baseline for diagnosis of incident diabetes in addition to the standard diagnostic criteria of fasting glucose ≥ 126 mg/dl. Subsequent hypothesis-testing analyses from randomized trials of pravastatin, simvastatin, atorvastatin, and rosuvastatin have suggested either no risk or a slight hazard; in one head-to-head comparison, use of atorvastatin 80 mg was slightly more likely than 40 mg pravastatin to result in incident diabetes, data which have suggested to some that this effect may relate to dose or potency. Further, in the recent Justification for the Use of Statins in Prevention: an Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin (JUPITER), statin treatment was associated with a small increase in physician-diagnosed diabetes, although without an increase in glucose levels (relative risk [RR] 1.25 [95% CI 1.05–1.49]). Given these uncertainties, we conducted a meta-analysis of available trials to identify what role, if any, statin therapy might have in the development of type 2 diabetes.

### The risk of hepatotoxicity, new onset diabetes and rhabdomyolysis in the era of high-intensity statin therapy: does statin type matter? [^116pGtXH]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

The 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines on cholesterol management have placed greater emphasis on high-intensity statin dosing for those with known cardiovascular disease or diabetes mellitus. Differences in risk of hepatotoxicity, new onset diabetes and rhabdomyolysis specifically between the high-intensity statins and the most common moderate-intensity statin, simvastatin, were not found to a significant degree in this review. Rather, baseline characteristics and drug-drug interactions (DDIs) appear to be more important regarding the risk of these adverse effects. Pharmacogenetic differences in statin metabolism may explain individual susceptibility, however genetic testing is not felt to be cost effective at this time. More importantly, statin choice should consider concomitant use of the many prevalent CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers, and when present, rosuvastatin selection is recommended to reduce DDIs and risk of statin-induced adverse effects.

### Statin use and risk of developing diabetes: results from the diabetes prevention program [^111XFruQ]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2017). Medium credibility.

The earliest report of a statin–diabetes associationsuggested a protective effect of pravastatin on diabetes incidence, although diabetes incidence was not determined using standardized criteria. Subsequent statin trials did not confirm this protective effect, and in the Justification of the Use of Statins in Prevention: an Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin (JUPITER) statin treatment was associated with an increase in physician-diagnosed diabetes (relative risk: 1.25; 95% CI 1.05 to 1.49). In a meta-analysis of six statin trials (including JUPITER), statin use was again associated with increased diabetes risk (OR: 1.13; 95% CI 1.03 to 1.23). This finding has subsequently been confirmed by others, including a large meta-analysis that included seven additional studies, which together included over 90 000 participants, of whom 4.9% were assigned to statins and 4.5% were assigned to placebo-developed diabetes (OR: 1.09; 95% CI 1.02 to 1.17). Similar HRs for statin-associated diabetes have been reported by other investigators. In the Women's Health Initiative, statin use at baseline was associated with increased risk of self-reported diabetes during follow-up (HR 1.71 (1.61 to 1.83)). Further, risk appeared to increase with longer duration of statin therapy. Similar to our analysis, adjustment for possible confounders related to statin use attenuated but did not eliminate the increased risk (adjusted HR 1.48 (1.38 to 1.59)), indicating that the factors leading to statin use were not themselves sufficient to explain the observed increase in diabetes.

### Diabetes and cardiovascular disease: when it comes to lipids, statins are all you need [^116AGCKz]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

THE PREVALENCE OF DIABETES AND CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE MORTALITY

The prevalence of obesity and diabetes continues to increase rapidly in the U.S. and all over the world. Obesity and diabetes are major risk factors for cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), but despite the increase in their prevalence, there seems to be a continuous steady decline in death rates from coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke. Moreover, cause-specific excess death associated with obesity has been declining despite the increase in obesity rates.

The reason behind this apparent paradox is probably a better control of other risk factors for CVD, such as cholesterol levels, hypertension, and smoking. Several trials demonstrated that more than half the decline in deaths from CHD in the last decades may be attributable to reductions in major risk factors. Of all risk factors, treating high cholesterol levels had the highest impact on the decline in CHD mortality. This is hardly surprising because the LDL cholesterol level is the strongest determinant of CHD risk, even in diabetic patients.

Prevention of CHD in diabetic patients and the question of residual risk

Statins are the most effective agents in reducing the risk of CHD in diabetic patients, reducing the relative risk by about one-third. An analysis based on the UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) risk engine demonstrated that even in the Steno-2 study, in which multifactorial intervention was used for the treatment of diabetes with an impressive reduction of both cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, lipid-lowering therapy accounted for more than 70% of CVD risk reduction. Actually, many more patients in the intensive therapy group achieved their cholesterol goal compared with the conventional therapy group (70 vs. 20%), while there was no difference between the groups in the attainment of their triglyceride goal. The main difference between the intensive and conventional treatment groups was in the use of statins. Eighty-five percent of the patients assigned to intensive therapy were given statins, compared with 22% of the patients assigned to conventional therapy. The result was a mean LDL cholesterol level of 83 mg/dL in the patients assigned to intensive therapy compared with 126 mg/dL in the patients assigned to conventional therapy.

However, in all studies, the risk in the group assigned to intensive therapy remained high. The remaining large residual risk is often cited as a proof for statins not being efficient enough in reducing cardiovascular risk, and therefore for the need to combine statins with other lipid-modifying agents. A closer look at the data may offer a different explanation.

### Statin use and risk of developing diabetes: results from the diabetes prevention program [^114R4qQJ]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2017). Medium credibility.

It has been suggested that statins may 'uncover' diabetes in individuals at high risk, which, on a population basis, could result in modest increase in diabetes risk. In a post-hoc analysis of the Treat to New Targets and Incremental Decrease in Clinical Endpoints Through Aggressive Lipid Lowering trials, the effects of statins to magnify diabetes risk were much more strongly evident among those with pre-diabetes than those without pre-diabetes. Similarly, within the JUPITER trial,77% of those in the intervention arm who developed diabetes during follow-up had impaired fasting glucose at study entry, and further analysis showed that increased statin-associated diabetes risk in this study was limited to participants who had at least one major diabetes risk factor. In an analysis of three other statin trials, fasting glucose, triglycerides, BMI and hypertension emerged as baseline clinical predictors of incident diabetes. These observations, along with the numerically higher estimates of statin-associated HRs observed in our analyses in DPP participants, suggest that the statin effect is more important among those with pre-existing diabetes risk. Paradoxically, however, variation in baseline diabetes risk factors failed to explain the further risk associated with statin therapy in our cohort, and the HR estimate was greatest among our lifestyle participants, who experienced the largest study-related reductions in diabetes risk.

### Statin-induced diabetes: will it change clinical practice? [^117Qtxj3]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

An increase in the incidence of physician-diagnosed diabetes with rosuvastatin in Justification for the Use of Statins in Primary Prevention: an Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin (JUPITER) published recently revived clinical interest in the effects of statins on glycemic control. The study showed that, after almost 2 years of follow-up in men and women with elevated levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein but average LDL cholesterol, rosuvastatin therapy was associated with a mild but significant increase in the identification of new-onset diabetes (3% in the statin arm, 2.4% in the placebo arm; P < 0.01). The potential association between statin use and new-onset diabetes gained attention in 2001 when a post hoc analysis of another primary prevention statin trial, the West of Scotland Coronary Prevention Study (WOSCOPS), reported that treatment with pravastatin decreased the hazard of developing type 2 diabetes by 30% (hazard ratio 0.7 [95% CI 0.5–0.99]; P = 0.042). These seemingly contradictory findings flank results from four other statin trials that failed to uncover a significant relationship between statin use and incident type 2 diabetes when the latter was evaluated as a tertiary end point.

Discussion

This report is the first to evaluate the statin–diabetes association within a randomized clinical trial designed to carefully ascertain diabetes incidence in subjects at high risk for diabetes. In this analysis, statin use was associated with a clear increase in diabetes risk in the cohort as a whole, with point estimates of the HRs suggesting this risk is increased by close to 30%. This augmented risk was only modestly attenuated with adjustment for variables related to the indication for statin treatment, suggesting that the indications for therapy were not themselves major contributors to diabetes risk. Participants who were prescribed statins had modestly higher levels of glucose at baseline, yet this also did not explain the higher rates of diabetes among statin users. Our data suggest the statin-associated diabetes risk did not differ significantly by treatment group, based on a test of statistical interaction. Nonetheless, the lower point estimate of the HR in the placebo group could reflect their more rapid progression to diabetes, providing less opportunity for statin exposure to demonstrably modify the rate of progression to overt diabetes. It is also possible that the somewhat higher HRs in the active treatment groups could reflect a less robust response to the intervention among those with greater baseline diabetes risk, who were also more likely to receive statin therapy (attenuation in model 4).

### Statin-induced diabetes: will it change clinical practice? [^112BzNr9]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

In this issue of Diabetes Care, Rajpathak et al. bring together six randomized placebo-controlled trials to explore diabetes risk with statins using a meta-analytical approach. The authors found that, if they included all six studies in the analysis (a total of 2,082 cases of incident diabetes in 57,593 study participants), there was no significant association between statin use and the development of type 2 diabetes (relative risk 1.06 [95% CI 0.93–1.25]). On the other hand, when they excluded the WOSCOPS data from the hypothesis-testing meta-analysis, an approach favored by some, a small increase in diabetes risk was found (1.13 [1.03–1.23]).

This meta-analysis and one that preceded the results from JUPITER found that inclusion of data from the pravastatin trial(s) introduced statistical heterogeneity. Because of their broader aims, meta-analyses commonly involve trials with differences in treatment regimen, patient characteristics, duration of follow-up, and outcome definition, differences that must be understood to interpret the results adequately. Experimental studies in cell culture and animal studies, as well as observations from clinical trials, suggest that there are differences among the various statins on insulin sensitivity and glycemic control, differences that could account for the heterogeneity observed in the meta-analysis. Important differences in the design of the statin trials analyzed, with varying periods of observation (1.9–6.0 years) and an inconsistent definition of incident diabetes, likely contribute to heterogeneity. Finally, differences in the characteristics of the subjects studied may impact the evaluation of statin-associated metabolic effects. In fact, Rajpathak et al. found that sex, but not age, accounted for some of the study's heterogeneity. WOSCOPS was the only one of the six trials analyzed that did not enroll female participants. In contrast, 38% of participants in JUPITER were women. Differences in overweight and obesity and in the proportion of subjects with impaired fasting glucose across studies also need to be explored because they could well explain the heterogeneity observed in the meta-analysis and account for the differential effect of statins on incident diabetes. For instance, baseline fasting glucose in WOSCOPS averaged 85 mg/dl; in the Long-Term Intervention with Pravastatin in Ischemic Disease (LIPID) study, mean fasting glucose was 93.6 mg/dl in subjects with normal glucose tolerance and 113 mg/dl in participants with impaired glucose tolerance. BMI among subjects in WOSCOPS averaged 25.9 kg/m 2, whereas the mean or median BMI among subjects in the Heart Protection Study (HPS), Controlled Rosuvastatin Multinational Trial in Heart Failure (CORONA), and JUPITER was above 27 kg/m 2.

### Statin-induced diabetes: will it change clinical practice? [^113Dj9jE]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

The study by Rajpathak et al. keeps alive the intriguing notion that statins may impact insulin sensitivity and glycemia. As with other meta-analyses, the results are only hypothesis generating because they rely on data published previously and thus are inherently observational. However, and more importantly, the study by Rajpathak et al. brings to our attention how little we know about statins beyond their benefit on macrovascular disease, specifically the need for randomized clinical trials to evaluate the role of statins on microvascular outcomes. If statins reduce macrovascular and microvascular morbidity and mortality, the associated modest increase in glycemia will no longer be an issue of concern.

### Time-varying and dose-dependent effect of long-term statin use on risk of type 2 diabetes: a retrospective cohort study [^114MQ1TP]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2020). Medium credibility.

Statins have demonstrated a heterogeneous potential to increase the incidence of diabetes. A previous meta-analysis of RCTs regarding the primary prevention of ASCVD demonstrated a relatively low risk of new-onset type 2 diabetes. However, the risk of type 2 diabetes was statistically significant even after a relatively short period of statin exposure of a mean 254 days and median 1.9 years. The small absolute risk of diabetes is outweighed by cardiovascular benefits in the short and medium term in individuals for whom statin therapy is recommended; long-term risk, however, has not fully been assessed in the previous literature. Our study expands the literature by estimating the time-dependent hazard levels to address the time-exposure interaction in the effect of statin use on new-onset type 2 diabetes. Our study showed that the inductive effect of new-onset type 2 diabetes is enhanced by the cumulative dose of statins per year. Short-term statin exposure (< 2 years) was not associated with new onset type 2 diabetes in all statin subtypes, whereas long-term exposure (≥ 5 years) to statins was associated with a statistically significant increase in the risk of new onset type 2 diabetes in all statin subtypes.

### Effects of statin therapy on diagnoses of new-onset diabetes and worsening glycaemia in large-scale randomised blinded statin trials: an individual participant data meta-analysis [^116dj58u]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2024). High credibility.

Our findings have several implications for clinical practice. First, our findings make clear that the majority of new diagnoses of diabetes resulting from statin therapy will occur among people who are already close to the biochemical diagnostic threshold for diabetes. In our study, approximately 62% of cases of new-onset diabetes attributable to statin therapy occurred among individuals in the top quarter of the glycaemia distribution, and adding other risk factors to glycaemia resulted in only a modest increase (to approximately 67%) in the proportion of cases attributable to statin therapy than for glycaemia alone. Our findings also imply that, since the effect of statin therapy on measures of glycaemia within an individual is small (ie, considerably smaller than the combined variation of within-individualand laboratory analytical variation), there is likely to be little clinical benefit in measuring glucose concentrations and HbA 1c values routinely after starting statin therapy with the aim of making comparisons to values taken before the initiation of a statin. However, people should continue to be screened for diabetes and associated risk factors and have their glycaemic control monitored in accordance with current clinical guidelines.

Summary

Background

Previous meta-analyses of summary data from randomised controlled trials have shown that statin therapy increases the risk of diabetes, but less is known about the size or timing of this effect, or who is at greatest risk. We aimed to address these gaps in knowledge through analysis of individual participant data from large, long-term, randomised, double-blind trials of statin therapy.

Methods

We conducted a meta-analysis of individual participant data from randomised controlled trials of statin therapy that participated in the CTT Collaboration. All double-blind randomised controlled trials of statin therapy of at least 2 years' scheduled duration and with at least 1000 participants were eligible for inclusion in this meta-analysis. All recorded diabetes-related adverse events, treatments, and measures of glycaemia were sought from eligible trials. Meta-analyses assessed the effects of allocation to statin therapy on new-onset diabetes (defined by diabetes-related adverse events, use of new glucose-lowering medications, glucose concentrations, or HbA 1c values) and on worsening glycaemia in people with diabetes (defined by complications of glucose control, increased use of glucose-lowering medication, or HbA 1c increase of ≥ 0·5%). Standard inverse-variance-weighted meta-analyses of the effects on these outcomes were conducted according to a prespecified protocol.

Findings

Of the trials participating in the CTT Collaboration, 19 trials compared statin versus placebo (123 940 participants, 25 701 [21%] with diabetes; median follow-up of 4·3 years), and four trials compared more versus less intensive statin therapy (30 724 participants, 5340 [17%] with diabetes, median follow-up of 4·9 years). Compared with placebo, allocation to low-intensity or moderate-intensity statin therapy resulted in a 10% proportional increase in new-onset diabetes (2420 of 39 179 participants assigned to receive a statin [1·3% per year] vs 2214 of 39 266 participants assigned to receive placebo [1·2% per year]; rate ratio [RR] 1·10, 95% CI 1·04–1·16), and allocation to high-intensity statin therapy resulted in a 36% proportional increase (1221 of 9935 participants assigned to receive a statin [4·8% per year] vs 905 of 9859 participants assigned to receive placebo [3·5% per year]; 1·36, 1·25–1·48). For each trial, the rate of new-onset diabetes among participants allocated to receive placebo depended mostly on the proportion of participants who had at least one follow-up HbA 1c measurement; this proportion was much higher in the high-intensity than the low-intensity or moderate-intensity trials. Consequently, the main determinant of the magnitude of the absolute excesses in the two types of trial was the extent of HbA 1c measurement rather than the proportional increase in risk associated with statin therapy. In participants without baseline diabetes, mean glucose increased by 0·04 mmol/L with both low-intensity or moderate-intensity (95% CI 0·03–0·05) and high-intensity statins (0·02–0·06), and mean HbA 1c increased by 0·06% (0·00–0·12) with low-intensity or moderate-intensity statins and 0·08% (0·07–0·09) with high-intensity statins. Among those with a baseline measure of glycaemia, approximately 62% of new-onset diabetes cases were among participants who were already in the top quarter of the baseline distribution. The relative effects of statin therapy on new-onset diabetes were similar among different types of participants and over time. Among participants with baseline diabetes, the RRs for worsening glycaemia were 1·10 (1·06–1·14) for low-intensity or moderate-intensity statin therapy and 1·24 (1·06–1·44) for high-intensity statin therapy compared with placebo.

Interpretation

Statins cause a moderate dose-dependent increase in new diagnoses of diabetes that is consistent with a small upwards shift in glycaemia, with the majority of new diagnoses of diabetes occurring in people with baseline glycaemic markers that are close to the diagnostic threshold for diabetes. Importantly, however, any theoretical adverse effects of statins on cardiovascular risk that might arise from these small increases in glycaemia (or, indeed, from any other mechanism) are already accounted for in the overall reduction in cardiovascular risk that is seen with statin therapy in these trials. These findings should further inform clinical guidelines regarding clinical management of people taking statin therapy.

### Effects of statin therapy on diagnoses of new-onset diabetes and worsening glycaemia in large-scale randomised blinded statin trials: an individual participant data meta-analysis [^111M9EAW]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2024). High credibility.

Background

Previous meta-analyses of summary data from randomised controlled trials have shown that statin therapy increases the risk of diabetes, but less is known about the size or timing of this effect, or who is at greatest risk. We aimed to address these gaps in knowledge through analysis of individual participant data from large, long-term, randomised, double-blind trials of statin therapy.

Methods

We conducted a meta-analysis of individual participant data from randomised controlled trials of statin therapy that participated in the CTT Collaboration. All double-blind randomised controlled trials of statin therapy of at least 2 years' scheduled duration and with at least 1000 participants were eligible for inclusion in this meta-analysis. All recorded diabetes-related adverse events, treatments, and measures of glycaemia were sought from eligible trials. Meta-analyses assessed the effects of allocation to statin therapy on new-onset diabetes (defined by diabetes-related adverse events, use of new glucose-lowering medications, glucose concentrations, or HbA 1c values) and on worsening glycaemia in people with diabetes (defined by complications of glucose control, increased use of glucose-lowering medication, or HbA 1c increase of ≥ 0·5%). Standard inverse-variance-weighted meta-analyses of the effects on these outcomes were conducted according to a prespecified protocol.

Findings

Of the trials participating in the CTT Collaboration, 19 trials compared statin versus placebo (123940 participants, 25701 [21%] with diabetes; median follow-up of 4·3 years), and four trials compared more versus less intensive statin therapy (30724 participants, 5340 [17%] with diabetes, median follow-up of 4·9 years). Compared with placebo, allocation to low-intensity or moderate-intensity statin therapy resulted in a 10% proportional increase in new-onset diabetes (2420 of 39179 participants assigned to receive a statin [1·3% per year] vs 2214 of 39266 participants assigned to receive placebo [1·2% per year]; rate ratio [RR] 1·10, 95% CI 1·04–1·16), and allocation to high-intensity statin therapy resulted in a 36% proportional increase (1221 of 9935 participants assigned to receive a statin [4·8% per year] vs 905 of 9859 participants assigned to receive placebo [3·5% per year]; 1·36, 1·25–1·48). For each trial, the rate of new-onset diabetes among participants allocated to receive placebo depended mostly on the proportion of participants who had at least one follow-up HbA 1c measurement; this proportion was much higher in the high-intensity than the low-intensity or moderate-intensity trials. Consequently, the main determinant of the magnitude of the absolute excesses in the two types of trial was the extent of HbA 1c measurement rather than the proportional increase in risk associated with statin therapy. In participants without baseline diabetes, mean glucose increased by 0·04 mmol/L with both low-intensity or moderate-intensity (95% CI 0·03–0·05) and high-intensity statins (0·02–0·06), and mean HbA 1c increased by 0·06% (0·00–0·12) with low-intensity or moderate-intensity statins and 0·08% (0·07–0·09) with high-intensity statins. Among those with a baseline measure of glycaemia, approximately 62% of new-onset diabetes cases were among participants who were already in the top quarter of the baseline distribution.

### Effects of statin therapy on diagnoses of new-onset diabetes and worsening glycaemia in large-scale randomised blinded statin trials: an individual participant data meta-analysis [^113DssjN]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2024). High credibility.

The placebo event rate for new-onset diabetes was substantially higher in the two trials of high-intensity statin (905 of 9859 participants assigned to placebo [3·5% per year]) than in the 14 trials of low-intensity or moderate-intensity statins (1·2% per year), and this difference was driven by biochemical diagnosis of diabetes (788 of 9859 participants assigned to placebo [3·0% per year] for high-intensity statins vs 1369 of 39 266 participants assigned to placebo [0·8% per year] for low-intensity or moderate-intensity statins; figure 1). Notably, in the high-intensity statin trials, HbA 1c was measured at least once after assignment to a treatment group in 14 345 (72%) of 19 794 participants without diabetes at baseline (all of which were in the JUPITER trial) and glucose concentration was measured at least twice after assignment to a treatment group in 9785 (49%) of 19 794 participants without diabetes at baseline, making a biochemical diagnosis possible. By comparison, HbA 1c values after assignment to a treatment group were available for just 2434 (3%) of 78 445 participants and glucose concentrations after assignment to a treatment group were available for 29 008 (37%) of 78 445 participants in the low-intensity or moderate-intensity trials. In the two trials, of high-intensity statin versus placebo that included participants without baseline diabetes, allocation to statin therapy resulted in a 36% relative increase in new-onset diabetes (1221 of 9935 participants assigned to statin therapy [4·8% per year] vs 905 of 9859 participants assigned to placebo [3·5% per year]; RR 1·36, 95% CI 1·25–1·48; figure 1), representing an absolute annual excess of 1·27% (95% CI 0·88–1·69). Although the absolute excess risk of new-onset diabetes varied depending on the method of diagnosis, the RRs were broadly similar (appendix p 16).

### Medication-induced hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus: a review of current literature and practical management strategies [^115dq2Vt]. Diabetes Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

Statins

Current Evidence

The incidence of diabetes mellitus was estimated to be between 9% and 12% with statin use in a recent meta-analysis. Another meta-analysis showed a significant increase (25%) in the incidence of new diabetes mellitus with rosuvastatin 20 mg daily compared to placebo. The JUPITER trial reported similar findings, with incident diabetes occurring more frequently in the rosuvastatin arm (hazard ratio 1.25 [95% CI 1.05–1.49, p = 0.01]). The number needed to harm per year ranged from 125 to 250 in a meta-analysis, and in another study comparing risk of incident diabetes to cardiovascular events, the number needed to treat per year to prevent one myocardial infarction is 39, so the benefit of statin use on cardiovascular outcomes greatly outweighs risk.

Mechanism of Action

The main cause of statin-induced hyperglycemia is due to decreased insulin secretion and action. Beta cell function may be disrupted via increased influx of cholesterol due to inhibition of HMG-CoA intracellularly, which leads to mitochondrial oxidative stress and beta cell apoptosis. Insulin resistance via inflammation has also been postulated as another mechanism. Under the conditions of obesity and dysregulated metabolic states, statins may activate inflammation leading to insulin resistance. Another observational study revealed that statin use allowed patients to be more liberal in caloric and fat intake leading to increased weight gain and worsening insulin resistance.

### Cardiovascular disease and risk management: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^111KzxVa]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Cardiovascular disease risk management in diabetes — risk‑based statin therapy and LDL targets state that the evidence is strong for people with diabetes aged 40–75 years, and current guidelines recommend that in people with diabetes who are at higher cardiovascular risk, especially those with one or more ASCVD risk factors, high-intensity statin therapy should be prescribed to reduce LDL cholesterol by ≥ 50% from baseline and to achieve the recommended LDL cholesterol goal of < 70 mg/dL (< 1.8 mmol/L). Since baseline LDL cholesterol may be difficult to ascertain in practice, a focus on an LDL cholesterol goal of < 70 mg/dL (< 1.8 mmol/L) rather than percent reduction in LDL cholesterol is recommended, and it may be reasonable to add ezetimibe or PCSK9 inhibitor to maximum tolerated statin therapy if LDL goal is not achieved; while there are no randomized controlled trials specifically assessing cardiovascular outcomes of adding ezetimibe or PCSK9 inhibitors to statin therapy in primary prevention, a meta-analysis suggests that there is a cardiovascular benefit of adding ezetimibe or PCSK9 inhibitors to treatment for people at high risk.

### Statins for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease [^114QX3as]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Reducing high blood cholesterol, a risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) events in people with and without a past history of CVD is an important goal of pharmacotherapy. Statins are the first-choice agents. Previous reviews of the effects of statins have highlighted their benefits in people with CVD. The case for primary prevention was uncertain when the last version of this review was published (2011) and in light of new data an update of this review is required.

Objectives

To assess the effects, both harms and benefits, of statins in people with no history of CVD.

Search Methods

To avoid duplication of effort, we checked reference lists of previous systematic reviews. The searches conducted in 2007 were updated in January 2012. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library (2022, Issue 4), MEDLINE OVID (1950 to December Week 4 2011) and EMBASE OVID (1980 to 2012 Week 1). There were no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials of statins versus placebo or usual care control with minimum treatment duration of one year and follow-up of six months, in adults with no restrictions on total, low density lipoprotein (LDL) or high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels, and where 10% or less had a history of CVD.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected studies for inclusion and extracted data. Outcomes included all-cause mortality, fatal and non-fatal CHD, CVD and stroke events, combined endpoints (fatal and non-fatal CHD, CVD and stroke events), revascularisation, change in total and LDL cholesterol concentrations, adverse events, quality of life and costs. Odds ratios (OR) and risk ratios (RR) were calculated for dichotomous data, and for continuous data, pooled mean differences (MD) (with 95% confidence intervals (CI)) were calculated. We contacted trial authors to obtain missing data.

Main Results

The latest search found four new trials and updated follow-up data on three trials included in the original review. Eighteen randomised control trials (19 trial arms; 56,934 participants) were included. Fourteen trials recruited patients with specific conditions (raised lipids, diabetes, hypertension, microalbuminuria). All-cause mortality was reduced by statins (OR 0.86, 95% CI 0.79 to 0.94); as was combined fatal and non-fatal CVD RR 0.75 (95% CI 0.70 to 0.81), combined fatal and non-fatal CHD events RR 0.73 (95% CI 0.67 to 0.80) and combined fatal and non-fatal stroke (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.89). Reduction of revascularisation rates (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.72) was also seen. Total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol were reduced in all trials but there was evidence of heterogeneity of effects. There was no evidence of any serious harm caused by statin prescription. Evidence available to date showed that primary prevention with statins is likely to be cost-effective and may improve patient quality of life. Recent findings from the Cholesterol Treatment Trialists study using individual patient data meta-analysis indicate that these benefits are similar in people at lower (< 1% per year) risk of a major cardiovascular event.

Authors' Conclusions

Reductions in all-cause mortality, major vascular events and revascularisations were found with no excess of adverse events among people without evidence of CVD treated with statins.

Although these results suggest a correlation between statin therapy and incident T2D, it should be noted that none of the statin trials were designed to look for incident T2D and that the meta-analyses used a range of methods to detect the condition. Further studies are therefore required to fully understand this effect.

### Statin therapy and risk of developing type 2 diabetes: a meta-analysis [^116Syou7]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

OBJECTIVE

Although statin therapy reduces cardiovascular risk, its relationship with the development of diabetes is controversial. The first study (West of Scotland Coronary Prevention Study [WOSCOPS]) that evaluated this association reported a small protective effect but used nonstandardized criteria for diabetes diagnosis. However, results from subsequent hypothesis-testing trials have been inconsistent. The aim of this meta-analysis is to evaluate the possible effect of statin therapy on incident diabetes.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS

A systematic literature search for randomized statin trials that reported data on diabetes through February 2009 was conducted using specific search terms. In addition to the hypothesis-generating data from WOSCOPS, hypothesis-testing data were available from the Heart Protection Study (HPS), the Long-Term Intervention with Pravastatin in Ischemic Disease (LIPID) Study, the Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial (ASCOT), the Justification for the Use of Statins in Prevention: an Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin (JUPITER), and the Controlled Rosuvastatin Multinational Study in Heart Failure (CORONA), together including 57,593 patients with mean follow-up of 3.9 years during which 2,082 incident diabetes cases accrued. Weighted averages were reported as risk ratios (RRs) with 95% CIs using a random-effects model. Statistical heterogeneity scores were assessed with the Q and I 2 statistic.

RESULTS

In the meta-analysis of the hypothesis-testing trials, we observed a small increase in diabetes risk (RR 1.13 [95% CI 1.03–1.23]) with no evidence of heterogeneity across trials. However, this estimate was attenuated and no longer significant when the hypothesis-generating trial WOSCOPS was included (1.06 [0.93–1.25]) and also resulted in significant heterogeneity (Q 11.8 [5 d.f.], P = 0.03, I² = 57.7%).

CONCLUSIONS

Although statin therapy greatly lowers vascular risk, including among those with and at risk for diabetes, the relationship of statin therapy to incident diabetes remains uncertain. Future statin trials should be designed to formally address this issue.

### Statins impair glucose uptake in human cells [^116iFrrr]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2014). Medium credibility.

Key messages

The use of statins can be associated with an increased risk of clinical complications including diabetes.
Statin-mediated inhibition of glucose uptake is accompanied by changes in proteolytic susceptibility of glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1).
Statins inhibit glucose uptake by inducing cholesterol-dependent conformational changes in GLUTs.
This molecular mechanism might explain hyperglycemic effects of statins observed in clinical trials.

### Effects of statin therapy on diagnoses of new-onset diabetes and worsening glycaemia in large-scale randomised blinded statin trials: an individual participant data meta-analysis [^117UAbmc]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2024). High credibility.

Further information on the risks of new-onset diabetes for statin regimens of differing intensity was available from four trials of more versus less intensive statin therapy. – Compared with less intensive statin therapy, more intensive statin therapy resulted in a 10% proportional increase in new-onset diabetes (RR 1·10, 95% CI 1·02–1·18), corresponding to an absolute annual excess of 0·22% (95% CI 0·05–0·41; appendix pp 17–18). The RR for high-intensity statin derived indirectly by combining selected trials of more versus less intensive statin and low-intensity or moderate-intensity statin versus placebo was 1·27 (95% CI 1·11–1·44; data not shown), which was similar to the estimate obtained in the direct comparison of high-intensity statin versus placebo (1·36, 1·25–1·48; figure 1).

Overall, at a given level of statin intensity, the relative effects on new-onset diabetes did not vary much in different types of participants (eg, by age, sex, race or ethnicity, history of vascular disease, BMI, eGFR, quartiles of glycaemia, diabetes risk score, and lipid characteristics; appendix pp 19–24), between statins (appendix p 15), or over time (appendix pp 25–26). In particular, the RRs for new-onset diabetes were similar among quartiles of baseline glycaemia and quartiles of baseline-defined risk of new-onset diabetes (appendix pp 19, 21). They were also similar when RRs were weighted for absolute differences in LDL cholesterol at 1 year between trials (low-intensity or moderate-intensity statin versus placebo, RR 1·09, 95% CI 1·03–1·15; high-intensity statin versus placebo, 1·31, 1·21–1·41).

### Statin therapy and risk of developing type 2 diabetes: a meta-analysis [^111HDC4Y]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS

Search strategy, inclusion criteria, and data extraction

We searched the Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online (MEDLINE) and Cochrane databases for randomized clinical trials (from inception to February 2009) using the following medical subject heading terms diabetes: statins, HMG CoA reductase inhibitor, pravastatin, atorvastatin, lovastatin, simvastatin, cerivastatin, rosuvastatin, and fluvastatin. To increase the sensitivity of our search, eligible studies were cross-referenced using the Science Citation Index (SCI). We also reviewed recently presented data at national and international meetings. Additionally, we looked through Internet-based sources of information (, and). We also corresponded with experts in the field, and in the case of eligible statin trials where diabetes incidence data were not reported in the published article, we contacted the investigators directly for this information.

Our meta-analysis included all randomized placebo-controlled trials that have reported data on incidence of type 2 diabetes during follow-up. To generate summary statistics, we included both primary and secondary cardiovascular prevention trials but excluded registries and other nonrandomized analyses as well as studies where patients had preexisting diabetes or where one statin was compared with another. In addition, we excluded studies where other lipid-lowering medications were used either in lieu of or in addition to statins. Studies examining the role of statins on nonclinical outcomes where no data on diabetes was available were excluded, as were studies limited to specialized noncardiovascular populations.

The primary clinical outcome of interest was the incidence of new-onset diabetes. Because this was not uniformly diagnosed, the different definitions in each trial were separately recorded. Physician- or patient-reported new-onset diabetes was permissible.

Two independent reviewers (S.N.R. and D.J.K.) abstracted the following variables in each study: 1) patient demographics, 2) number of patients who experienced and who were at risk for the outcome of diabetes, 3) type and dose of statin used, 4) criteria used for diagnosis of diabetes, and 5) duration of follow-up. Discrepancies were resolved through a third reviewer (J.C.).

The methodological quality of the included randomized clinical trials was assessed using criteria suggested by Jadad et al. Because all studies met at least three of the five criteria, they were judged to be of high quality. No formal scoring method was therefore used.

### Time-and dose-dependent association of statin use with risk of clinically relevant new-onset diabetes mellitus in primary prevention: a nationwide observational cohort study [^112hisrb]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Although the exact mechanism underlying diabetes mellitus risk of statin remains yet to be determined, several mechanisms have been suggested to explain this risk. 3, 21, 22 New‐onset diabetes mellitus has been observed in clinical trials and in meta‐analyses involving statin therapy. 4, 5, 6, 7, 23 The JUPITER trial was the first placebo‐controlled statin trial to formally report an increased risk of developing diabetes mellitus. 4 The excess of diabetes mellitus risks seems to be limited to patients with major risk factors for diabetes mellitus. 23 In subsequent meta‐analyses, standard dose of statin was associated with a proportional increase of ≈10% in reported diabetes mellitus, and more intensive doses with about a 10% further increase. 5, 6, 7 Although the magnitude of the risk of new‐onset diabetes mellitus following statin use was very pronounced, several observational studies showed similar findings. 8, 9, 24, 25, 26 Our population‐based study provided another evidence supporting the notion that statin use was significantly associated with an increased risk of incident diabetes mellitus in primary‐prevention patients. Although some studies showed conflicting findings with regard to overall dose and duration effects of statin on diabetes mellitus, 27, 28 we found a time‐ and dose‐dependent association of statin use with increased diabetes mellitus risks. However, it is also recognized that people receiving statins have some common risk factors for diabetes mellitus that become worse over time and those with worse initial risk factors probably get more aggressive (higher dose) treatment with statins.

Recommendations for adults with high blood cholesterol — risk-based statin therapy are as follows: "In adults at intermediate risk (≥ 7.5% to < 20% 10-year ASCVD risk), statin therapy reduces risk of ASCVD, and in the context of a risk discussion, if a decision is made for statin therapy, a moderate-intensity statin should be recommended". Targets are specified: "In intermediate risk (≥ 7.5% to < 20% 10-year ASCVD risk) patients, LDL-C levels should be reduced by 30% or more", and "in patients at high risk (≥ 20% 10-year ASCVD risk), levels should be reduced by 50% or more". Diabetes-specific guidance states: "In adults 40 to 75 years of age with diabetes, regardless of estimated 10-year ASCVD risk, moderate-intensity statin therapy is indicated", and "In adults with diabetes mellitus who have multiple ASCVD risk factors, it is reasonable to prescribe high-intensity statin therapy with the aim to reduce LDL-C levels by 50% or more". For very high LDL-C, "In patients 20 to 75 years of age with an LDL-C level of 190 mg/dL (≥ 4.9 mmol/L) or higher, maximally tolerated statin therapy is recommended".

### CETP inhibition, statins and diabetes [^111eGpGF]. Atherosclerosis (2018). Low credibility.

Type 2 diabetes is a causal risk factor for the development of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). While treatment with a statin reduces the risk of having an ASCVD event in all people, including those with type-2 diabetes, statin treatment also increases the likelihood of new onset diabetes when given to those with risk factors for developing diabetes. Treatment with the cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) inhibitor, anacetrapib, reduces the risk of having a coronary event over and above that achieved with a statin. However, unlike statins, anacetrapib decreases the risk of developing diabetes. If the reduced risk of new-onset diabetes is confirmed in another CETP inhibitor outcome trial, there will be a case for considering the use of the combination of a statin plus a CETP inhibitor in high ASCVD-risk people who are also at increased risk of developing diabetes.

Statins

Lipid lowering with statin therapy has been the cornerstone of the prevention and treatment of ASCVD over the past 3 decades. High‐intensity statins can reduce LDL‐C levels by ≥ 50%, which has been shown to reduce the risk of major ASCVD events significantly. Magnitude of LDL‐C lowering directly relates to efficacy; however, a meta‐analysis of randomized controlled trials and data from JUPITER (Justification for the Use of Statins in Prevention: An Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin) confirm wide variation in the degree of LDL‐C reduction achieved among individuals treated with statins.

In terms of safety, statins are generally well tolerated, but statin‐associated adverse effects occur in some patients. Most frequent are statin‐associated muscle symptoms, reported to affect between 1 in 1000 and 1 in 10 000 people treated with standard doses. Statin‐associated muscle symptoms, or fear of statin‐associated muscle symptoms, are key factors leading to statin discontinuation or nonadherence, which remain challenging in clinical practice and contribute to adverse ASCVD outcomes. Statins can also cause adverse effects on glucose homeostasis and modestly increase the risk of new‐onset diabetes in individuals with predisposing risk factors, including those with prediabetes. This does not detract from recommendations to use statins in this population, given the associated reduction in ASCVD risk.

### American association of clinical endocrinology consensus statement: comprehensive type 2 diabetes management algorithm-2023 update [^115NtE51]. Endocrine Practice (2023). High credibility.

Type 2 diabetes dyslipidemia — statins are first-line and intensity is matched to ASCVD risk with monitoring. Unless contraindicated, a statin should be used as the first-line therapy for dyslipidemia in persons with T2D. High-risk patients (T2D with < 10% 10-year risk) should be started on moderate-intensity statin therapy, which results in an LDL-C reduction in the range of 30% to 40%. For persons at very high risk (10%–20% 10-year risk) and extreme risk (> 20% 10-year risk), high-intensity statin therapy, which lowers LDL-C by > 50% to 60%, should be started regardless of baseline LDL-C level. Lipids should initially be monitored at 6- to 12-week intervals and then at less frequent intervals (eg, 6 months) once at goal.

Lipid management for primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) in people with diabetes — age‑stratified recommendations specify: in people 20–39 years of age, consider statin therapy if there are additional ASCVD risk factors. In people 40–75 years of age, use moderate-intensity statin therapy in those without ASCVD risk factors, and use a high-intensity statin in those with ≥ 1 ASCVD risk factor, with an LDL cholesterol goal of < 70 mg/dL (< 1.8 mmol/L); it may be reasonable to add ezetimibe or PCSK9 inhibitor to maximum tolerated statin therapy if LDL goal is not achieved, and use bempedoic acid for those who are statin intolerant. In people > 75 years of age, continue current statin therapy or consider initiating a moderate-intensity statin after weighing benefits and risks.

### Risk of incident diabetes with intensive-dose compared with moderate-dose statin therapy: a meta-analysis [^115wxsWc]. JAMA (2011). Excellent credibility.

Context

A recent meta-analysis demonstrated that statin therapy is associated with excess risk of developing diabetes mellitus.

Objective

To investigate whether intensive-dose statin therapy is associated with increased risk of new-onset diabetes compared with moderate-dose statin therapy.

Data Sources

We identified relevant trials in a literature search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (January 1, 1996, through March 31, 2011). Unpublished data were obtained from investigators.

Study Selection

We included randomized controlled end-point trials that compared intensive-dose statin therapy with moderate-dose statin therapy and included more than 1000 participants who were followed up for more than 1 year.

Data Extraction

Tabular data provided for each trial described baseline characteristics and numbers of participants developing diabetes and experiencing major cardiovascular events (cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction or stroke, coronary revascularization). We calculated trial-specific odds ratios (ORs) for new-onset diabetes and major cardiovascular events and combined these using random-effects model meta-analysis. Between-study heterogeneity was assessed using the I(2) statistic.

Results

In 5 statin trials with 32,752 participants without diabetes at baseline, 2749 developed diabetes (1449 assigned intensive-dose therapy, 1300 assigned moderate-dose therapy, representing 2.0 additional cases in the intensive-dose group per 1000 patient-years) and 6684 experienced cardiovascular events (3134 and 3550, respectively, representing 6.5 fewer cases in the intensive-dose group per 1000 patient-years) over a weighted mean (SD) follow-up of 4.9 (1.9) years. Odds ratios were 1.12 (95% confidence interval, 1.04–1.22; I(2) = 0%) for new-onset diabetes and 0.84 (95% CI, 0.75–0.94; I(2) = 74%) for cardiovascular events for participants receiving intensive therapy compared with moderate-dose therapy. As compared with moderate-dose statin therapy, the number needed to harm per year for intensive-dose statin therapy was 498 for new-onset diabetes while the number needed to treat per year for intensive-dose statin therapy was 155 for cardiovascular events.

Conclusion

In a pooled analysis of data from 5 statin trials, intensive-dose statin therapy was associated with an increased risk of new-onset diabetes compared with moderate-dose statin therapy.

### Pharmacologic lipid-lowering therapy in type 2 diabetes mellitus: background paper for the American College of Physicians [^114vyGZm]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Cardiovascular disease is the primary complication and cause of death in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Modification of cardiovascular risk factors may improve patient outcomes.

Purpose

To evaluate the effectiveness of pharmacologic lipid-lowering therapy on outcomes in type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Data Sources

Review of the literature.

Study Selection

Randomized trials evaluating clinical outcomes of lipid-lowering treatment in patients with diabetes.

Data Extraction

Studies were identified by searching the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, meta-analyses, review articles, and inquiries to experts. The Cochrane Library and MEDLINE searches were done in September 2002. Data were abstracted onto standardized forms by a single reviewer and were confirmed by a second reviewer.

Data Synthesis

Meta-analysis of 6 primary prevention studies showed that lipid-lowering medications reduced risks for cardiovascular outcomes (relative risk, 0.78 [95% CI, 0.67 to 0.89]; absolute risk reduction, 0.03 [CI, 0.01 to 0.04] in 4.3 years of treatment); 1 major cardiovascular event was prevented by treating 34 to 35 patients. Meta-analysis of 8 studies of secondary prevention showed a similar relative risk (0.76 [CI, 0.59 to 0.93]) but more than twice the absolute risk reduction (0.07 [CI, 0.03 to 0.12] in 4.9 years of treatment) and a number needed to treat for benefit of 13 to 14. Most studies compared a lipid-lowering drug with placebo but did not evaluate the effect of reaching specific cholesterol levels. The benefit of lipid lowering with a fixed dose of a statin appeared to be similar regardless of starting cholesterol levels.

Limitations

Target cholesterol levels and the effectiveness of dose titration (or the use of multiple agents) have not been rigorously examined.

Conclusions

In patients with type 2 diabetes, treatment with lipid-lowering agents reduces cardiovascular risk. Most patients, including those whose baseline low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels are below 2.97 mmol/L (< 115 mg/dL), and possibly below 2.59 mmol/L (< 100 mg/dL), benefit from statins. Moderate doses of these drugs suffice in most patients with diabetes.

### Approach to lipid management in the patient with diabetes [^112z8W5F]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Diabetes is associated with increased atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk, a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. Disordered lipid metabolism is a major contributor to ASCVD risk in diabetes. Dyslipidemia in type 2 diabetes is characterized by hypertriglyceridemia, low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and the presence of small, dense low-density lipoprotein particles. Statins have demonstrated longstanding benefit for reducing ASCVD risk in individuals with diabetes. Newer agents for add-on therapies to statins are now available for additional cardiovascular risk reduction. In this clinical overview, we review the pathogenesis of dyslipidemia in both type 1 and 2 diabetes and provide an update on the management of lipids in the individual with diabetes. We discuss the importance of appropriate risk stratification and individualized treatment selection and the need to avoid therapy inertia to mitigate cardiovascular risk. We also address lipid-related effects of glycemic-lowering therapies.

### Statins, risk of diabetes, and implications on outcomes in the general population [^116tVR8L]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

Objectives

This study aimed to evaluate the association of statin exposure and incident diabetes, and subsequent outcomes in the general population.

Background

Cardiovascular events as consequences of atherosclerosis and diabetes are reduced by statins. However, statins are associated with excessive risk of diabetes occurrence according to clinical trial analyses. From daily-practice perspectives, it remains unclear whether statin use increases risk; prognoses of diabetes after exposure require further clarification.

Methods

From Taiwan National Health Insurance beneficiaries age ≥ 45 years (men) and ≥ 55 years (women) before 2004, subjects continuously treated with statins ≥ 30 days during 2000 to 2003 and nonusers before 2004 were identified. Among nondiabetic individuals at the cohort entry, controls were matched to statin users on a 4:1 ratio by age, sex, atherosclerotic comorbidities, and year of their entry. Outcomes as diabetes, major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE, the composite of myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke), and in-hospital deaths were assessed.

Results

Over a median of 7.2 years, annual rates of diabetes were significantly higher in statin users (2.4% vs. 2.1%, p < 0.001), whereas MACE (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.82; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.68 to 0.98 for myocardial infarction; HR: 0.94; 95% CI: 0.86 to 1.03 for ischemic stroke; HR: 0.91; 95% CI: 0.84 to 0.99 for MACE]) and in-hospital mortality (HR: 0.61; 95% CI: 0.55 to 0.67]) were less. The risk-benefit analyses suggested that statin treatment was favorable in high-risk (HR: 0.89; 95% CI: 0.83 to 0.95) and secondary prevention (HR: 0.89; 95% CI: 0.83 to 0.96) populations. Among diabetic patients, prior statin use was associated with fewer MACE (HR: 0.75; 95% CI: 0.59 to 0.97). In-hospital deaths were similar in statin-related diabetes among high-risk (HR: 1.11; 95% CI: 0.83 to 1.49) and secondary prevention (HR: 1.08; 95% CI: 0.79 to 1.47) subjects compared with nondiabetic controls.

Conclusions

Risk of diabetes was increased after statins, but outcomes were favorable.

### Statin diabetogenicity: guidance for clinicians [^113eTSiE]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2013). Low credibility.

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a strong, independent risk factor for cardiovascular (CV) and cerebrovascular outcomes. Meta-analysis of five randomised clinical trials (n = 33,040) showed that, although intensive versus standard glycaemic control significantly reduced CV events in people with T2D, the reduction was less than that achieved with lipid-lowering or antihypertensive treatment. Furthermore, fasting plasma glucose (FPG) concentrations were a modest predictor for CV risk in people without T2D. Thus, although effective glycaemic control is important for the prevention/management of T2D, other risk factors must be addressed to effectively reduce CV risk. Reducing low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol levels using statins significantly reduces CV risk in people with and without T2D. Although statins are generally safe and well tolerated, conflicting data exist regarding the diabetogenic effects of some statins. Based on recent clinical trial data, the US Food and Drug Administration have changed the labelling of all statins to include 'an effect of statins on incident diabetes and increases in haemoglobin A1c and/or FPG'. However, the literature suggests that the beneficial effects of most statins on CV risk continue to outweigh their diabetogenic risks and that statins should remain as first-line therapy for the majority of people with dyslipidaemia and metabolic syndrome or T2D. Mechanisms explaining the potentially higher incidence of T2D with statin therapy have not been confirmed. However, independent predictors for statin-associated T2D appear to include elevated levels of baseline FPG, BMI, blood pressure and fasting triglycerides. Moreover, although some statins (for example, atorvastatin) are associated with increased haemoglobin A1c levels in patients receiving intensive but not moderate therapy, other statins (for example, pitavastatin) have demonstrated neutral or favourable effects on glucose control in patients with and without T2D or metabolic syndrome. The potential diabetogenic effects of statins may therefore differ between drugs. In conclusion, conflicting data exist regarding the diabetogenic effects of statins. Further studies are required to understand whether all statins have the same effect and whether some patient groups are at higher risk than others. Meanwhile, results suggest that the net CV benefit favours the use of statin therapy in patients with dyslipidaemia, irrespective of T2D risk.

### Higher potency statins and the risk of new diabetes: multicentre, observational study of administrative databases [^116Es3yn]. BMJ (2014). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Labels on statin medications in the United States now include information concerning glycaemic effects, including diabetes and increases in haemoglobin A 1c or fasting plasma glucose. The US Food and Drug Administration approved these labelling changes in February 2012, based mainly on evidence drawn from two meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials. The first meta-analysis of statins compared with placebo, conducted by Rajpathak and colleagues, included 57 593 patients from six trials and showed a small increase in risk for type 2 diabetes (relative risk 1.13, 95% confidence interval 1.03 to 1.23). The second meta-analysis, reported the following year by Sattar and colleagues, examined the effect of statins on the risk of diabetes in 91 140 patients from 13 trials. That meta-analysis showed that statins were associated with a 9% increased risk of diabetes (odds ratio 1.09, 1.02 to 1.17). Preiss and colleagues also compared the risk of diabetes associated with higher potency and lower potency statins in a meta-analysis of 32 752 patients in five trials, and found that higher potency statins were associated with a 12% increased risk of diabetes relative to lower potency statins (odds ratio 1.12, 1.04 to 1.22).

### The benefits of statins in people without established cardiovascular disease but with cardiovascular risk factors: meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^117WgTVF]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Objectives

To investigate whether statins reduce all cause mortality and major coronary and cerebrovascular events in people without established cardiovascular disease but with cardiovascular risk factors, and whether these effects are similar in men and women, in young and older (> 65 years) people, and in people with diabetes mellitus.

Design

Meta-analysis of randomised trials.

Data Sources

Cochrane controlled trials register, Embase, and Medline. Data abstraction Two independent investigators identified studies on the clinical effects of statins compared with a placebo or control group and with follow-up of at least one year, at least 80% or more participants without established cardiovascular disease, and outcome data on mortality and major cardiovascular disease events. Heterogeneity was assessed using the Q and I(2) statistics. Publication bias was assessed by visual examination of funnel plots and the Egger regression test.

Results

10 trials enrolled a total of 70 388 people, of whom 23 681 (34%) were women and 16 078 (23%) had diabetes mellitus. Mean follow-up was 4.1 years. Treatment with statins significantly reduced the risk of all cause mortality (odds ratio 0.88, 95% confidence interval 0.81 to 0.96), major coronary events (0.70, 0.61 to 0.81), and major cerebrovascular events (0.81, 0.71 to 0.93). No evidence of an increased risk of cancer was observed. There was no significant heterogeneity of the treatment effect in clinical subgroups.

Conclusion

In patients without established cardiovascular disease but with cardiovascular risk factors, statin use was associated with significantly improved survival and large reductions in the risk of major cardiovascular events.

### Higher potency statins and the risk of new diabetes: multicentre, observational study of administrative databases [^111igu9v]. BMJ (2014). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the incremental increase in new onset diabetes from higher potency statins compared with lower potency statins when used for secondary prevention.

Design

Eight population based cohort studies and a meta-analysis.

Setting

Six Canadian provinces and two international databases from the UK and US.

Participants

136,966 patients aged ≥ 40 years newly treated with statins between 1 January 1997 and 31 March 2011.

Methods

Within each cohort of patients newly prescribed a statin after hospitalisation for a major cardiovascular event or procedure, we performed as-treated, nested case-control analyses to compare diabetes incidence in users of higher potency statins with incidence in users of lower potency statins. Rate ratios of new diabetes events were estimated using conditional logistic regression on different lengths of exposure to higher potency versus lower potency statins; adjustment for confounding was achieved using high dimensional propensity scores. Meta-analytic methods were used to estimate overall effects across sites.

Main Outcome Measures

Hospitalisation for new onset diabetes, or a prescription for insulin or an oral antidiabetic drug.

Results

In the first two years of regular statin use, we observed a significant increase in the risk of new onset diabetes with higher potency statins compared with lower potency agents (rate ratio 1.15, 95% confidence interval 1.05 to 1.26). The risk increase seemed to be highest in the first four months of use (rate ratio 1.26, 1.07 to 1.47).

Conclusions

Higher potency statin use is associated with a moderate increase in the risk of new onset diabetes compared with lower potency statins in patients treated for secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. Clinicians should consider this risk when prescribing higher potency statins in secondary prevention patients.

### Is statin-modified reduction in lipids the most important preventive therapy for cardiovascular disease? A pro / con debate [^113SGejH]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

These results were confirmed in a meta-analysis that included ten trials (70,388 participants without established CVD), which showed that statins significantly reduced the risk of all-cause mortality (odds ratio (OR) 0.88), major coronary events (0.70) and major cerebrovascular events (0.81). In another analysis, Ray et al. determined whether statin therapy reduces all-cause mortality among intermediate to high-risk individuals without a history of CVD. Data from 11 studies with 65,229 participants showed that use of statins in the high-risk primary prevention setting was not associated with a statistically significant reduction (RR 0.91) in the risk of all-cause mortality. These findings complement and extend the above-mentioned meta-analyses as well as the results from the Justification for the Use of Statins in Primary Prevention: An Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin (JUPITER) trial, which reported that statins reduced death from any cause by 12%. However, these estimates were based on information from both individuals with and without pre-existing CHD or stroke, which may overestimate the real benefits in the primary prevention setting. Despite the continuing discussion of the effect of statins on all-cause mortality in these groups of patients, their role in primary prevention individuals, especially in high-risk ones, is unquestionable. In low and moderate-risk patients the decision regarding starting statin therapy should be assessed individually taking into account the cardiovascular risk as well as the risk of statin-related side effects (e.g. new onset diabetes, especially in patients with overweight/obesity and/or insulin resistance).

### Statin therapy and risk of developing type 2 diabetes: a meta-analysis [^112SA1Do]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

In the first study that evaluated the statin-diabetes association, Freeman et al. reported an inverse association between pravastatin use and diabetes incidence in the WOSCOPS (RR 0.7 [95% CI 0.55–0.99]) but used additional nonstandardized criteria for diabetes diagnosis. Subsequent statin trials did not confirm this protective effect, and in the recent JUPITER a small but significant increase in physician-reported diabetes was reported among statin users compared with those taking placebo, although in the absence of any effect on glucose levels. As suggested here, and contrary to the hypothesis-generating data from WOSCOPS, in this meta-analysis of five hypothesis-testing trials a small but statistically significant increase in diabetes incidence may be associated with statin use, which does not appear to be drug or dose specific. This potential effect was attenuated and no longer significant in meta-analysis of all available data including WOSCOPS.

### Statin use and risk of developing diabetes: results from the diabetes prevention program [^111HjDza]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2017). Medium credibility.

The strengths of the current analysis include rigorous diabetes ascertainment, prolonged follow-up and updated information about statin use every 6 months. The main limitation of this analysis is that statin treatment was not randomized or protocol-driven, but was based on non-study physician assessments of need for statin treatment based on factors related to CVD risk. The observed association between statin use and diabetes risk in this population was not significantly attenuated after controlling for potential confounders related to indication for statin use. In addition, statin use was based on self-report, which could have resulted in some misclassification. Intensity of statin therapy has been reported to affect diabetes risk, but since statin dose is not available in our cohort, our ability to assess this is limited. For individual patients, a potential modest increase in diabetes risk clearly needs to be balanced against the consistent and highly significant reductions in myocardial infarction, stroke and cardiovascular death associated with statin treatment. Nonetheless, glucose status should be monitored and healthy lifestyle behaviors reinforced in high-risk patients who are prescribed statins for CVD prophylaxis.

The most important of these limitations is that most of the included trials were not principally designed to test a hypothesis of the effects of statin therapy on diabetes. As aforementioned, one consequence of this was a paucity of data for measures of glycaemia among those without diabetes. Event rates for cases resulting from measurement of fasting plasma glucose might have been overestimated if participants did not fast, although the absolute differences between active and placebo groups would not be materially biased, and exclusion of cases of biochemically determined diabetes did not substantially affect findings. Moreover, cases of diabetes in our analysis were constructed by use of trial data, and we were unable to assess type of diabetes, but we expect that the vast majority of cases in participants of the age included in the trials would have been type 2 diabetes. Very occasionally, glucose-lowering medication might have been used for an indication other than diabetes, and although we were able to count initiation and escalation of diabetes treatment, we were not able to analyse any changes in doses of these medications. The intention-to-treat analyses of the effects of allocation to statin therapy in this meta-analysis preserve the randomised comparisons within each trial, but might of course result in some underestimation of the full effects of taking statin therapy in the long term. Additionally, some data were unavailable for our analyses: data from 218 (8·5%) of 2555 participants in the AURORA trial,27 (0·5%) of 4982 participants in the CORONA trial, and 1088 (6·5%) of 16 714 participants in the JUPITERtrial were not provided because of data privacy concerns. However, it is unlikely that missing data would have affected our main conclusions.

Among people without diabetes, statin therapy produces a dose-dependent increase in the rate of diagnosis of diabetes by inducing a very small increase in glycaemia. People are most at risk of exceeding the diagnostic threshold for diabetes due to statin therapy if their glycaemic control is close to the threshold before treatment. The diabetes-related risks arising from the small changes in glycaemia resulting from statin therapy are greatly outweighed by the benefits of statins on major vascular events when the direct clinical consequences of these outcomes are taken into consideration.

### Statin therapy and risk of developing type 2 diabetes: a meta-analysis [^111JtPMm]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Among the individual studies, four of the studies reported a null association between statin use and diabetes risk. One study (WOSCOPS) reported a statistically significant protective effect of statin use on diabetes incidence (RR 0.70 [95% CI 0.50–0.99]; P = 0.042), whereas one (JUPITER) reported a significant positive association (1.25 [1.05–1.49]; P = 0.01).

In a meta-analysis of the five hypothesis-testing trials, the summary RR for incident diabetes was 1.13 (95% CI 1.03–1.24; P = 0.007) (Fig. 2). This corresponded to a risk difference of 0.5% (0.2–0.8). No significant heterogeneity was observed in this latter analysis (Q statistic = 4.06 [4 d.f.], P = 0.40, I² = 1.6%), and we observed no evidence in these hypothesis-testing analyses of any interaction by specific drug. However, when the hypothesis-generating WOSCOPS was included in the analyses, the summary RR from the random-effects model was 1.06 (95% CI 0.93–1.23; P = 0.38) (Fig. 2). This analysis also revealed significant heterogeneity (Q statistic = 11.8 [5 d.f.], P = 0.03, I² = 57.7%) driven largely by the WOSCOPS data. Further, there was no evidence of publication bias (P = 0.15).

In JUPITER, the median (interquartile range) age was 66.0 (60.0–71.0) years, and patients with at least 1 major diabetes risk factor were at higher risk for developing diabetes than those without such a risk factor.

The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Task Force on Clinical Practice Guidelines recently published its 2018 recommendations on management of LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) in people with diabetes. For primary prevention, moderate-intensity statin therapy is recommended for those aged 40–75 years, with a preference for high-intensity statin treatment for older subjects and for those with higher estimated risk or risk-enhancing factors following a patient-clinician discussion. Statin therapy may be reasonable in adults < 40 years or > 75 years of age where there is less evidence for benefit. For people with diabetes and established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, high-intensity statin therapy is recommended. The majority of these subjects have very high risk, and an LDL-C goal of < 70 mg/dL is recommended. If this target is not achieved, ezetimibe and/or a proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitor may be added.

### Effects of statin therapy on diagnoses of new-onset diabetes and worsening glycaemia in large-scale randomised blinded statin trials: an individual participant data meta-analysis [^115DDCgw]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2024). High credibility.

In the high-intensity statin trials, the event rate for the development of new-onset diabetes was substantially higher in both the intervention and placebo groups than that seen in the low-intensity or moderate-intensity statin trials. This higher rate was driven by a greater proportion of trial participants in the high-intensity statin trials, particularly in the JUPITER trial, having at least one follow-up HbA 1c measurement. Biochemically determined diabetes rates were 3·0% per annum for high-intensity trials and 0·8% for low-intensity or moderate-intensity therapy trials in the placebo groups, whereas rates of diabetes determined by reports of diabetes-related adverse events and use of glucose-lowering medication in the placebo groups for the same groups of trials were similar (figure 1). This finding indicates that, although the relative excesses of new-onset diabetes observed for low-intensity or moderate-intensity statin versus placebo and high-intensity statin versus placebo are likely to be robust and generalisable, the differences in absolute excesses of diagnoses of diabetes between these two groups of trials were determined predominantly by the proportion of trial participants for whom a biochemical diagnosis was made solely through an HbA 1c measurement after randomisation. In practice, such measurements might not be obtained routinely in people without diabetes, but it is likely that the rate of diagnosis of diabetes would be higher than it currently is if such a practice was widely adopted.

The RRs for new-onset diabetes did not vary significantly over time. We hypothesise that the reason for this finding is that, in each successive year of follow-up, a new group of people becomes at risk of exceeding the diagnostic threshold for diabetes because of an age-related increase in glycaemia, and those taking a statin will be slightly more likely to do so. For high-intensity statin therapy, the absolute rates were observed to be greater for JUPITER compared with SPARCL, particularly when biochemical measurements of glycaemia were included as a diagnostic criterion (appendix p 16). By contrast, among people with a known diagnosis of diabetes at baseline, the early excess of worsening glycaemia with a statin did not persist in the long term (appendix pp 26–27), perhaps because glycaemic control is typically monitored in such individuals and likely to be managed.

### Cardiovascular benefits and diabetes risks of statin therapy in primary prevention: an analysis from the JUPITER trial [^117BTcap]. Lancet (2012). Excellent credibility.

Background

In view of evidence that statin therapy increases risk of diabetes, the balance of benefit and risk of these drugs in primary prevention has become controversial. We undertook an analysis of participants from the JUPITER trial to address the balance of vascular benefits and diabetes hazard of statin use.

Methods

In the randomised, double-blind JUPITER trial, 17,603 men and women without previous cardiovascular disease or diabetes were randomly assigned to rosuvastatin 20 mg or placebo and followed up for up to 5 years for the primary endpoint (myocardial infarction, stroke, admission to hospital for unstable angina, arterial revascularisation, or cardiovascular death) and the protocol-prespecified secondary endpoints of venous thromboembolism, all-cause mortality, and incident physician-reported diabetes. In this analysis, participants were stratified on the basis of having none or at least one of four major risk factors for developing diabetes: metabolic syndrome, impaired fasting glucose, body-mass index 30 kg/m(2) or higher, or glycated haemoglobin A(1c) greater than 6%. The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00239681.

Findings

Trial participants with one or more major diabetes risk factor (n = 11,508) were at higher risk of developing diabetes than were those without a major risk factor (n = 6095). In individuals with one or more risk factors, statin allocation was associated with a 39% reduction in the primary endpoint (hazard ratio [HR] 0·61, 95% CI 0·47–0·79, p = 0·0001), a 36% reduction in venous thromboembolism (0·64, 0·39–1·06, p = 0·08), a 17% reduction in total mortality (0·83, 0·64–1·07, p = 0·15), and a 28% increase in diabetes (1·28, 1·07–1·54, p = 0·01). Thus, for those with diabetes risk factors, a total of 134 vascular events or deaths were avoided for every 54 new cases of diabetes diagnosed. For trial participants with no major diabetes risk factors, statin allocation was associated with a 52% reduction in the primary endpoint (HR 0·48, 95% CI 0·33–0·68, p = 0·0001), a 53% reduction in venous thromboembolism (0·47, 0·21–1·03, p = 0·05), a 22% reduction in total mortality (0·78, 0·59–1·03, p = 0·08), and no increase in diabetes (0·99, 0·45–2·21, p = 0·99). For such individuals, a total of 86 vascular events or deaths were avoided with no new cases of diabetes diagnosed. In analysis limited to the 486 participants who developed diabetes during follow-up (270 on rosuvastatin vs 216 on placebo; HR 1·25, 95% CI 1·05–1·49, p = 0·01), the point estimate of cardiovascular risk reduction associated with statin therapy (HR 0·63, 95% CI 0·25–1·60) was consistent with that for the trial as a whole (0·56, 0·46–0·69). By comparison with placebo, statins accelerated the average time to diagnosis of diabetes by 5·4 weeks (84·3 [SD 47·8] weeks on rosuvastatin vs 89·7 [50·4] weeks on placebo).

Interpretation

In the JUPITER primary prevention trial, the cardiovascular and mortality benefits of statin therapy exceed the diabetes hazard, including in participants at high risk of developing diabetes.

### Risk of incident diabetes among patients treated with statins: population based study [^116x8DSb]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Hydroxymethyl glutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) are among the most widely prescribed drugs, with established benefits in patients at risk of cardiovascular events. Although statins are tolerated well by most patients, an association with new onset diabetes has recently been suggested. In the JUPITER (justification for the use of statins in prevention: an intervention trial evaluating rosuvastatin) trial, rosuvastatin was associated with a 27% increased risk of new onset diabetes compared with placebo. An increased risk compared with placebo was also observed with atorvastatin and simvastatin. In contrast, the West of Scotland coronary prevention study (WOSCOPS) suggested that patients taking pravastatin faced a 30% lower risk of diabetes compared with placebo (relative risk 0.7, 95% confidence interval 0.5 to 0.99).

In light of these discordant results, several meta-analyses have attempted to characterize the risk of new onset diabetes during treatment with statins. Limited data, however, exist for direct comparisons of individual statins. Despite these conflicting findings, some evidence supports the notion that different statins might impart differential risks of diabetes. In animal models, pravastatin has been shown to increase adiponectin, improving insulin sensitivity and inhibiting gluconeogenesis, while simvastatin reduces insulin secretion, and atorvastatin and lovastatin impair glucose tolerance. For these reasons, in February 2012 the United States Food and Drug Administration mandated labeling changes for all statins except pravastatin.

We examined the healthcare records of more than 1.5 million older people from Ontario, Canada, to examine the association between individual statin use and new onset diabetes.

Baseline diabetes was defined as a recorded history of diabetes, adverse event of diabetes (appendix pp 3–6) on or before the date of participant assignment to a treatment group, use of glucose-lowering medication (appendix p 7), fasting plasma glucose concentration of 7·0 mmol/L or higher or random plasma glucose of 11·1 mmol/L or higher, or HbA 1c value of 6·5% or higher. For participants without baseline diabetes, the outcome of new-onset diabetes was defined as the first record after participant assignment to a treatment group of an adverse event of diabetes, use of glucose-lowering medication, at least two measurements (not necessarily consecutive) of fasting plasma glucose concentration 7·0 mmol/L or higher or random plasma glucose concentration of 11·1 mmol/L or higher, or at least one HbA 1c value of 6·5% or higher (based on widely used biochemical thresholds). For participants with baseline diabetes, the outcome of worsening glycaemia was defined as a recording after participant assignment to a treatment group of an adverse event relating to ketosis or complications of glucose control, an HbA 1c increase (from baseline) of 0·5% or higher, or escalation of glucose-lowering medication (ie, starting such medication for participants not on medication at baseline, starting insulin for those not on insulin therapy at baseline, or an increase in the number of non-insulin glucose-lowering medications, with or without insulin). Variables for which data were extracted were specified previously.

### Statin therapy and diabetes progression… [^113Bggbf]. JAMA Network (2021). Excellent credibility.

Diabetes progression outcome occurred in 55. 9% of statin users vs
48. 0% of active comparators. Each individual component of the composite outcome was significantly higher among statin users. Secondary analysis demonstrated a dose-response relationship with a higher intensity of low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol lowering associated with greater diabetes progression. Conclusions and Relevance This retrospective matched-cohort study found that statin use was associated with diabetes progression, including greater likelihood of insulin treatment initiation, significant hyperglycemia, acute glycemic complications, and an increased number of prescriptions for glucose-lowering medication classes. The risk-benefit ratio of statin use in patients with diabetes should take into consideration its metabolic effects.

Several randomized controlled trials 3–5 and large prospective and retrospective observational studies6–8 have noted that patients treated with statin therapy had increased insulin resistance, hemoglobin A1C levels, and fasting plasma glucose levels. Odds of diabetes progression outcome were consistently higher in statin users compared with nonusers among all secondary and sensitivity analyses. The odds of diabetes progression among statin users in the healthy cohort were higher than the overall cohort. Intensive cholesterol lowering was associated with highest odds of diabetes progression outcome among statin users in compared with nonusers. This study of a national cohort of VA patients with diabetes found that statin use was associated with an escalation of diabetes treatment, including a higher risk of initiating insulin and the use of more glucose-lowering medication classes.

This escalation of diabetes treatment was associated with worse diabetes control, including new persistent hyperglycemia and acute glycemic complications. We read with great interest the paper by Mansi et al. on the relationship between statin therapy initiation and diabetes progression. In our opinion, this possible causal association needs to be better investigated. It is known that the risk of statin-induced newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus is about 0. 2% per year of treatment although this estimate is dependent on population risk and will be greater in patients with clinical characteristics associated with higher risk of diabetes mellitus. Furthermore, it is known that simvastatin significantly raises the levels of lipoprotein, increasing.

### Statin use is associated with diabetes progression… [^115U7S8A]. JAMA Network (2021). Excellent credibility.

A recent observational study suggests that people with diabetes who use statins experience a greater rate of diabetes progression than those who don't use the drugs. The retrospective study of US patients in the Veterans Affairs health system included 83 022 pairs of statin users and active comparators who used a histamine-2 receptor blocker or proton pump inhibitor but not statins. The diabetes progression composite outcome included new insulin initiation, increase in the number of glucose-lowering medication classes prescribed, 5 or more blood glucose measurements of 200 mg/dL or greater, or a new diagnosis of ketoacidosis or uncontrolled diabetes.

### Risk of incident diabetes with intensive-dose compared with moderate-dose statin therapy… [^116ohXT5]. JAMA Network (2011). Excellent credibility.

Context A recent meta-analysis demonstrated that statin therapy is associated with excess risk of developing diabetes mellitus. Objective To investigate whether intensive-dose statin therapy is associated with increased risk of new-onset diabetes compared with moderate-dose statin therapy. Data Sources We identified relevant trials in a literature search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Unpublished data were obtained from investigators. Conclusion In a pooled analysis of data from 5 statin trials, intensive-dose statin therapy was associated with an increased risk of new-onset diabetes compared with moderate-dose statin therapy. Quiz Ref IDStatin therapy significantly reduces cardiovascular events among individuals with and without a history of diabetes mellitus compared with placebo.

1, 2 Intensive-dose statin therapy has also been shown to further reduce cardiovascular events compared with moderate-dose statin therapy. 1, 3 A recent meta-analysis of 13 randomized placebo and standard care. controlled trials involving 91 140 individuals reported that among patients treated with statins, the risk of developing diabetes was 9% higher over a 4-year period compared with patients randomized to placebo or standard care. 4 Recently, findings of 3 large. In absolute terms, there were 2. 0 additional cases of diabetes per 1000 patient-years among those receiving intensive-dose therapy, corresponding to a number needed to harm of 498 per year.

Quiz Ref IDThis study demonstrates that use of intensive-dose statin therapy compared with moderate-dose statin therapy was associated with a higher incidence of new-onset diabetes. However, intensive statin therapy was associated with fewer major cardiovascular events. Fourth, analyses were conducted without access to individual participant data. Fifth, we cannot exclude the possibility that intensive statin therapy may have caused more adverse effects and therefore led to differences in routine clinical care between those treated with intensive- and moderate-dose regimens, resulting in detection bias. In conclusion, this meta-analysis extends earlier findings of an increased incidence of diabetes with statin therapy by providing evidence of a dose-dependent association.
