## Question

Can I add 100mg canagliflozin QD to this patient's current regime of Jardiance 10mg QD and 10 units lantus at night?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether adding canagliflozin 100 mg daily to a regimen that already includes empagliflozin 10 mg daily and insulin glargine 10 units nightly is appropriate, safe, and evidence-based. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacology and whether dual SGLT2 inhibition is rational or redundant. Then, I should verify drug–drug interaction risks, especially for hypoglycemia with insulin. Next, I will review clinical trial data on adding canagliflozin to insulin and check for any dual SGLT2 inhibitor studies. After that, I need to assess guideline recommendations and labeling for SGLT2 inhibitors in combination with insulin. Finally, I will consider renal function constraints, safety signals unique to canagliflozin, and outline a practical, safer alternative plan with monitoring recommendations [^1157CxAg] [^115JdpUi].

> Let me first confirm the pharmacologic overlap. Empagliflozin and canagliflozin are both SGLT2 inhibitors that reduce renal glucose reabsorption, thereby increasing urinary glucose excretion and lowering plasma glucose independent of insulin; adding a second SGLT2 inhibitor targets the same transporter and would be mechanistically redundant rather than complementary, so I should be cautious about duplicative class therapy unless there is compelling evidence, which I need to check carefully [^116jJdjs].

> Wait, let me verify the interaction risk before concluding anything. DrugBank notes that combining empagliflozin and canagliflozin may increase hypoglycemic activity, and both agents individually increase hypoglycemia risk when combined with insulin glargine, so stacking them on top of basal insulin plausibly amplifies hypoglycemia risk even though SGLT2 inhibitors themselves are not insulin secretagogues; I should confirm whether any trials actually studied this exact triple combination, but I suspect none have, which would make this off-label and unsupported [^116gAD4p].

> Next, I should review the evidence for adding canagliflozin to insulin. In a randomized trial of patients with type 2 diabetes on insulin, adding canagliflozin 100 mg reduced HbA1c by about 0.6–0.7% and allowed insulin dose reduction, but hypoglycemia occurred more frequently than placebo and was managed by protocolized insulin down-titration; importantly, that study did not include concomitant empagliflozin, so it does not support dual SGLT2 therapy with insulin [^1134ARik] [^117JrHXG]. Hold on, I should verify whether any trials evaluated dual SGLT2 inhibition; I find no randomized data supporting empagliflozin plus canagliflozin together, and no guideline endorses dual SGLT2 blockade, which reinforces that this combination lacks evidentiary support [^notfound].

> I need to check guideline positions and labeling next. ADA Standards and ACC expert pathways endorse SGLT2 inhibitors for glycemic, cardiovascular, and renal benefits and allow combination with insulin, but they do not recommend or even mention dual SGLT2 inhibitor therapy; moreover, cardiorenal benefits are realized at standard starting doses with no titration required, so there is no indication to combine two SGLT2 inhibitors to enhance outcomes, and FDA labeling for canagliflozin provides dosing with insulin but again does not suggest dual SGLT2 use [^115JdpUi] [^1157CxAg] [^117SCeZ7].

> Let me consider renal function constraints because they matter for both safety and efficacy. For canagliflozin, if eGFR is 30–59 mL/min/1.73 m², the maximum recommended dose is 100 mg daily, and if eGFR is below 30 mL/min/1.73 m², initiation for glycemic control is not recommended, though continuation at 100 mg may be appropriate in selected patients with albuminuria for cardiorenal protection; I should confirm the patient's eGFR before making any recommendation, as this could independently argue against adding canagliflozin or limit its dose [^116hMxBK] [^116cYLsb].

> I will now examine safety signals specific to canagliflozin that could compound risk in this scenario. Canagliflozin carries an increased risk of lower-limb amputations observed in CANVAS, has volume depletion risk amplified by osmotic diuresis, and can precipitate euglycemic ketoacidosis, especially when insulin doses are reduced or in the perioperative setting; adding it to empagliflozin and insulin could increase genitourinary infections and volume-related adverse effects without proven incremental benefit, so I should double-check the patient's foot risk, hydration status, and surgery plans before contemplating this addition [^11164edN] [^1157CxAg] [^112duaZa].

> But wait, what if the goal is stronger A1c lowering or insulin dose reduction? The rational, evidence-based approach is to intensify within guideline-supported options rather than stack two SGLT2 inhibitors; for example, adding a GLP-1 receptor agonist provides complementary mechanisms, weight loss, and cardiovascular benefit, and in a head-to-head trial, semaglutide achieved greater A1c and weight reductions than canagliflozin 300 mg, supporting this strategy over dual SGLT2 therapy; alternatively, if insulin is being used, consider structured basal up-titration or adding prandial coverage per ADA titration guidance rather than introducing a second SGLT2 inhibitor [^1128HX8r] [^114vL31g] [^111YPr6n].

> Hold on, I should verify a practical, safer plan if the patient is already on empagliflozin 10 mg and 10 units of glargine. I would not add canagliflozin; instead, I would optimize the current regimen by reassessing adherence, diet, and activity, checking for other agents that increase hypoglycemia risk, and considering a modest insulin up-titration or addition of a GLP-1 RA if A1c remains above target; if the patient has CKD with albuminuria, I would continue the SGLT2 inhibitor for cardiorenal protection at 100 mg if already on canagliflozin, but I would not initiate dual SGLT2 therapy, and I would monitor for volume depletion, genital infections, and foot complications during follow-up [^115JdpUi] [^1157CxAg] [^112duaZa].

> In summary, I should confirm the bottom line clearly. Adding canagliflozin 100 mg to empagliflozin 10 mg plus insulin glargine is not recommended: it constitutes duplicative class therapy without supportive evidence, increases hypoglycemia risk via interaction with insulin, and exposes the patient to additional adverse effects unique to canagliflozin; the evidence-based path is to avoid dual SGLT2 inhibition and instead intensify with guideline-supported options such as GLP-1 RA addition or insulin optimization, while ensuring renal function and safety parameters are addressed [^116gAD4p] [^1134ARik] [^112duaZa] [^115JdpUi].

Do not add **canagliflozin 100 mg** to a regimen that already includes **empagliflozin 10 mg** and **insulin glargine 10 units**. This creates **duplicated SGLT2 inhibition** without added benefit and increases the risk of hypoglycemia, genital infections, and euglycemic ketoacidosis. If glycemic control is inadequate, consider switching to a different SGLT2 inhibitor or adding a GLP-1 receptor agonist, and adjust insulin as needed [^116gAD4p] [^1157CxAg] [^1134ARik] [^112DEkFy] [^114vL31g].

---

## Pharmacological rationale against dual SGLT2 inhibition

- **Mechanism of action**: SGLT2 inhibitors reduce renal glucose reabsorption, increasing urinary glucose excretion and lowering blood glucose [^116jJdjs].

- **Redundancy**: Combining canagliflozin and empagliflozin duplicates SGLT2 blockade without additional benefit, as both target the same transporter.

- **Class effects**: Both agents share similar efficacy and safety profiles, so dual therapy does not meaningfully improve glycemic control.

---

## Clinical evidence and guidelines

- **Lack of evidence**: No clinical trials support dual SGLT2 inhibition for glycemic control or cardiorenal benefit.

- **Guideline stance**: ADA and EASD do not recommend dual SGLT2 inhibitor therapy; they endorse SGLT2 inhibitors as monotherapy or with other classes, not with each other [^notfound].

- **Trial-tested dosing**: For CV/renal benefit, use the lowest trial-tested dose (e.g. canagliflozin 100 mg or empagliflozin 10 mg) and do not titrate for cardiorenal indications [^115JdpUi].

---

## Potential risks and adverse effects

- **Hypoglycemia**: Combining SGLT2 inhibitors with insulin increases hypoglycemia risk; monitor closely and adjust insulin as needed [^1134ARik].

- **Genital infections**: Dual SGLT2 therapy increases genital mycotic infections due to sustained glycosuria [^113sR1GQ].

- **Euglycemic ketoacidosis**: SGLT2 inhibitors can cause euglycemic ketoacidosis, especially with insulin or illness; dual therapy may increase this risk [^1157CxAg].

- **Volume depletion**: Dual SGLT2 inhibition heightens risk of hypotension and dehydration, particularly in older adults or those on diuretics [^115kAGDZ].

---

## Alternative strategies for glycemic control

If glycemic control is inadequate, consider the following:

- **Switch SGLT2 inhibitor**: Switch from empagliflozin to canagliflozin (or vice versa) rather than combining them.

- **Add GLP-1 receptor agonist**: GLP-1 RAs provide complementary mechanisms, weight loss, and cardiovascular benefit without duplication [^115JdpUi].

- **Adjust insulin**: Titrate insulin glargine or add prandial insulin per guidelines to improve control [^114vL31g].

---

## Clinical scenarios where dual SGLT2 inhibition might be considered

There are **no established scenarios** in which dual SGLT2 inhibition is recommended. It may be considered only in a research setting or when other options are contraindicated, with close monitoring and specialist oversight.

---

## Monitoring and patient counseling

If dual SGLT2 therapy is pursued (not recommended), **monitor closely** for hypoglycemia, genital infections, volume depletion, and ketoacidosis, and counsel patients on infection prevention, hydration, and recognition of ketoacidosis symptoms.

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

Do not add **canagliflozin 100 mg** to a regimen that already includes **empagliflozin 10 mg** and **insulin glargine 10 units** because of redundancy and increased adverse effects. Use alternative strategies — such as switching SGLT2 agents, adding a GLP-1 RA, or adjusting insulin — to improve glycemic control [^1157CxAg].

### Addition of canagliflozin to insulin improves glycaemic control and reduces insulin dose in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: a randomized controlled trial [^117JrHXG]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of canagliflozin in reducing the required insulin dose and the risk of hypoglycaemia in type 2 diabetes (T2D). This study was conducted in patients with T2D treated with insulin. They were randomly assigned to the control (n = 17) and canagliflozin (n = 17, plus 100mg/day canagliflozin) groups. In both groups, a defined insulin dose adjustment protocol was applied to achieve the same level of glycaemic control. The change from baseline in daily insulin dose was significantly smaller in the canagliflozin group (3.9 units/day) than in the control group (13.4 units/day; P = 0.040). Low blood glucose index and predicted % of blood glucose (BG) < 70mg/dL, which are hypoglycaemia-related variables, worsened significantly in the control group but both remained unchanged in the canagliflozin group. The standard deviation for night-time BG levels improved significantly only in the canagliflozin group. Supplementation of insulin therapy with 100mg canagliflozin in patients with T2D reduced the required insulin dose and hypoglycaemic risk and flattened night-time glycaemic fluctuations while maintaining the same level of glycaemic control.

Canagliflozin as Add-on Combination Therapy with Insulin (With or Without Other Anti-Hyperglycemic Agents, Including Metformin HCl)

A total of 1,718 adult patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on insulin greater than or equal to 30 units/day or insulin in combination with other antihyperglycemic agents participated in an 18-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled subtrial of a cardiovascular trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of canagliflozin in combination with insulin. Of these patients, a subgroup of 432 patients with inadequate glycemic control received canagliflozin or placebo plus metformin HCl and ≥ 30 units/day of insulin over 18 weeks.

In this subgroup, the mean age was 61 years, 67% of patients were male, and the mean baseline eGFR was 81 mL/min/1.73 m2. Patients on metformin HCl in combination with basal, bolus, or basal/bolus insulin for at least 10 weeks entered a 2-week, single-blind, placebo run-in period. Approximately 74% of these patients were on a background of metformin HCl and basal/bolus insulin regimen. After the run-in period, patients were randomized to canagliflozin 100 mg, canagliflozin 300 mg, or placebo, administered once daily as add-on to metformin HCl and insulin. The mean daily insulin dose at baseline was 93 units, which was similar across treatment groups.

### Efficacy of additional canagliflozin administration to type 2 diabetes patients receiving insulin therapy: examination of diurnal glycemic patterns using continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) [^112q6uMu]. Diabetes Therapy (2017). Low credibility.

The appearance of non-insulin-dependent SGLT2 inhibitors with a new action mechanism may increase the number of options for drug therapy, further advancing diabetes care. SGLT2 inhibitors are available for several procedures: monotherapy to combination therapy with other oral blood-glucose-lowering agents or insulin. Therefore, they can be selected for patients with differing background factors.

The additional administration of SGLT2 inhibitors to type 2 diabetes patients receiving insulin improved diurnal changes in the blood glucose level, decreasing the dose of insulin, suggesting that these agents are effective for insulin-related weight gain.

### 2020 expert consensus decision pathway on novel therapies for cardiovascular risk reduction in patients with type 2 diabetes: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^115JdpUi]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2020). High credibility.

Type 2 diabetes cardiovascular risk reduction — initiation and titration of SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) should follow trial-tested dosing. SGLT2 inhibitors with CV benefit should be initiated at the lowest dose tested in CV and renal outcomes trials (e.g., 100 mg for canagliflozin, 10 mg for dapagliflozin, 10 mg for empagliflozin), and no further dose titration is needed for CV or renal risk reduction. Among GLP-1RAs, dulaglutide, liraglutide, or injectable semaglutide have demonstrated CV benefit to reduce the risk of MACE, and a GLP-1RA with demonstrated CV benefit should be initiated at the lowest dose and up-titrated stepwise to the doses used in the trials or the otherwise maximal tolerated dose. Prior to initiating T2D therapies aimed at CV disease risk reduction, a detailed patient-clinician risk discussion is recommended, including risks, benefits, drug-drug interactions, safety, patient preferences, and cost considerations.

SGLT2 inhibitors with CV benefit — initiation and renal dose modifications — should be initiated at the lowest dose tested in CV and renal outcomes trials, and no further dose titration is needed for CV or renal risk reduction. For canagliflozin, dose modifications are: eGFR 30 to 59 mL/min/1.73 m2: max dose 100 mg daily; and eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2: use is not recommended for glycemic control. For dapagliflozin, eGFR < 45 mL/min/1.73 m2: use is not recommended for glycemic control; and eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2: use is contraindicated. For empagliflozin, eGFR < 45 mL/min/1.73 m2: use is not recommended.

### Efficacy and safety of canagliflozin, an inhibitor of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2, when used in conjunction with insulin therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes [^1134ARik]. Diabetes Care (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

There are limited data about the effects of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors when used with insulin. We report the efficacy and safety of canagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes using insulin.

Research Design and Methods

The CANagliflozin CardioVascular Assessment Study is a double-blind, placebo-controlled study that randomized participants to placebo, canagliflozin 100 mg, or canagliflozin 300 mg once daily, added to a range of therapies. The primary end point of this substudy was the change in HbA1c from baseline at 18 weeks among patients using insulin; 52-week effects were also examined.

Results

Individuals receiving insulin at baseline were randomized to receive placebo (n = 690), canagliflozin 100 mg (n = 692), or canagliflozin 300 mg (n = 690). These individuals were 66% male and had a median age of 63 years, mean HbA1c of 8.3% (67 mmol/mol), BMI of 33.1 kg/m(2), estimated glomerular filtration rate of 75 mL/min/1.73 m(2), fasting plasma glucose of 9.2 mmol/L, and a median daily insulin dose of 60 IU. Most individuals were using basal/bolus insulin. Reductions in HbA1c with canagliflozin 100 and 300 mg versus placebo were -0.62% (95% CI -0.69, -0.54; -6.8 mmol/mol [95% CI -7.5, -5.9]; P < 0.001) and -0.73% (95% CI -0.81, -0.65; -8.0 mmol/mol [95% CI -8.9, -7.1]; P < 0.001) at 18 weeks and -0.58% (95% CI -0.68, -0.48; -6.3 mmol/mol [95% CI -7.4, -5.2]) and -0.73% (95% CI -0.83, -0.63; -8.0 mmol/mol [95% CI -9.1, -6.9]) at 52 weeks. There were significant falls in fasting plasma glucose, body weight, and blood pressure at both time points and there was a greater incidence of hypoglycemia, genital mycotic infections, and hypovolemia with both canagliflozin doses.

Conclusions

Canagliflozin added to insulin therapy improved glycemic control and decreased body weight. There was a greater frequency of several anticipated side effects, although few led to discontinuation of treatment.

### SGLT2 inhibitors in type 2 diabetes management: key evidence and implications for clinical practice [^116jJdjs]. Diabetes Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

The SGLT2 Inhibitor Class of Medicines

Mechanism of Action

SGLT2 cotransporters are present in the early proximal convoluted tubule (PCT) of the kidney, where they actively reabsorb glucose to optimally maintain blood glucose levels. SGLT2i medicines work independently of insulin to selectively inhibit reabsorption of glucose in the kidney, increasing excretion via the urine.

Three SGLT2i therapies are currently available for clinical use in the UK for the treatment of T2DM: canagliflozin (distributed in the UK by Napp Pharmaceuticals Limited), dapagliflozin (AstraZeneca UK Limited) and empagliflozin (Boehringer Ingelheim Limited). These therapies are all very similar in terms of their mechanisms of action, although canagliflozin is known to also have affinity for SGLT1 cotransporters found in the intestine and kidneys. Phase 3 studies suggest that this property may contribute to the enhanced postprandial glucose-lowering action of canagliflozin 300 mg compared with canagliflozin 100 mg.

UK Treatment Guidelines

Based upon available efficacy and safety data, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) and the Scottish Intercollegiate Guideline Network (SIGN) recommend that SGLT2i therapies can be considered alongside other glucose-lowering medicines as an option at the first intensification of treatment for T2DM, following failure to achieve control with metformin, or as a first-line treatment in cases of metformin intolerance. SGLT2i medicines may also be used as add-on third-line therapies. For example, they may be used in combination with other glucose-lowering agents such as oral therapies or glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) or with insulin. Canagliflozin and empagliflozin may be prescribed in combination with pioglitazone, but dapagliflozin is not approved for combination treatment with pioglitazone.

### Canagliflozin in conjunction with sulfonylurea maintains glycemic control and weight loss over 52 weeks: a randomized, controlled trial in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^113WLjiM]. Clinical Therapeutics (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

Our aim was to investigate the long-term efficacy and safety of canagliflozin, a sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor, added to background sulfonylurea (SU) monotherapy for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Methods

The CANagliflozin cardioVascularAssessment Study (CANVAS) was a double-blind, placebo-controlled cardiovascular outcomes study that randomly assigned participants to receive placebo or canagliflozin 100 or 300 mg once daily in addition to routine therapy. CANVAS included a prespecified SU substudy of patients taking background doses of SU monotherapy; data from the primary efficacy evaluation at 18 weeks have been published previously. We performed a retrospective analysis of the SU substudy at 52 weeks to measure long-term efficacy and safety of canagliflozin used with an SU. The primary objective of the long-term extension was to assess the change from baseline to 52 weeks in glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA 1c).

Findings

A total of 215 patients were included in the 52-week extension study. Patients receiving both 100-mg and 300-mg doses of canagliflozin achieved a sustained reduction in HbA 1c relative to patients receiving placebo (-0.61% [95% CI, -0.941% to -0.282%] and -0.66% [95% CI, -0.993% to -0.332%], respectively), regardless of baseline HbA 1c, duration of diabetes, SU dose, estimated glomerular filtration rate, or body mass index. A sustained reduction in fasting plasma glucose was also found in both 100-mg and 300-mg groups, relative to the placebo group (-2.04 mmol/L [95% CI, -2.778 to -1.299 mmol/L] and -1.88 mmol/L [95% CI, -2.623 to -1.146 mmol/L], respectively). Weight was reduced significantly at 52 weeks in both 100-mg and 300-mg groups, relative to placebo (-1.9% [95% CI, -3.2% to -0.7%] and -2.0% [95% CI, -3.2% to -0.7%], respectively). Reduction in systolic blood pressure was also reported for both dose groups relative to the placebo group, but there was no clear difference in HDL-C, LDL-C, or triglyceride levels. Canagliflozin was generally well tolerated. While documented hypoglycemia occurred in 14% of patients on placebo, the frequency of hypoglycemia with the addition of canagliflozin was similar. There was an increased frequency of genital mycotic infections in both men (5.1%) and women (10.4%) in both canagliflozin groups combined, relative to the placebo group (0%), and their frequency increased in the higher-dose group. There was a slightly higher rate of renal impairment in those treated with canagliflozin versus placebo (2.1% vs 0%).

Implications

After 52 weeks, patients receiving canagliflozin added to background SU had sustained reductions in HbA 1c and fasting plasma glucose, without increasing hypoglycemia and body weight; safety findings were generally consistent with the known safety profile of the drug. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01032629.

### Efficacy and safety of empagliflozin twice daily versus once daily in patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on metformin: a 16-week, randomized, placebo-controlled trial [^111hXveD]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) with a glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) level ≥ 7 and ≤ 10% were randomized to receive empagliflozin 12.5mg twice daily (n = 219), 25mg once daily (n = 218), 5mg twice daily (n = 219) or 10mg once daily (n = 220), or placebo (n = 107) as add-on to stable-dose metformin immediate release (IR) twice daily for 16weeks. The primary endpoint was change from baseline in HbA1c at week 16. At week 16, change from baseline in HbA1c with empagliflozin twice daily was non-inferior to empagliflozin once daily and vice versa. The adjusted mean (95% confidence interval) difference in change from baseline in HbA1c with empagliflozin 12.5mg twice daily versus 25mg once daily was -0.11% (-0.26, 0.03), and with empagliflozin 5mg twice daily versus 10mg once daily it was -0.02% (-0.16, 0.13). All empagliflozin regimens were well tolerated; thus, when used as add-on to metformin IR in patients with T2DM, the therapeutic effect of empagliflozin twice-daily and once-daily regimens can be considered equivalent.

Reduction in Glycated Haemoglobin (HbA1c)

Each of the SGLT2i treatments available within the UK have proven efficacy as monotherapies and combination therapies. Canagliflozin has demonstrated efficacy in nine randomised controlled trials (RCTs), involving 10,285 people with T2DM, with the 300 mg dosage of canagliflozin proving to be particularly efficacious in terms of glycaemic control. Dapagliflozin has shown effective treatment outcomes in 14 RCTs, conducted with 7056 people with T2DM. The efficacy of empagliflozin has been established in 12 RCTs involving 14,663 T2DM individuals, with the 25 mg dosage providing additional improvements in blood glucose control compared with the 10 mg dosage.

In addition, a systematic review and network meta-analysis of RCT data (from January 2005 to January 2015) concerning SGLT2i efficacy, compared with placebo, demonstrated significant reductions in HbA1c with each treatment when prescribed as monotherapy and dual therapy, with few differences between the class members concerning outcomes. Compared with placebo, reductions in HbA1c were greater with canagliflozin 300 mg monotherapy (-1.23%) than with other SGLT2i treatments or canagliflozin 100 mg. Regarding dual therapy, canagliflozin 300 mg achieved the greatest reductions in HbA1c, although statistical significance was only observed in comparison to canagliflozin 100 mg [mean difference 0.15; confidence interval (CI) 0.04–0.26].

Weight Loss

SGLT2i agents are associated with weight loss, much of which is due to a reduction in visceral fat, rather than urinary glucose excretion. As a result, these treatments should be helpful for individuals aspiring to lower or control their body weight, an important factor and common feature of T2DM management.

### Efficacy and safety of canagliflozin used in conjunction with sulfonylurea in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: a randomized, controlled trial [^117MHUCZ]. Diabetes Therapy (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

The efficacy and safety of canagliflozin, a sodium glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, was evaluated in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) inadequately controlled on sulfonylurea monotherapy.

Methods

The CANagliflozin cardioVascular Assessment Study (CANVAS) is a double-blind, placebo-controlled cardiovascular outcomes study that randomized participants to placebo or canagliflozin 100 or 300 mg once daily in addition to routine therapy. Participants in the CANVAS trial are men and women aged ≥ 30 years with T2DM and a history or high risk of cardiovascular disease, and inadequate glycemic control (glycated hemoglobin [HbA1c] ≥ 7.0% and ≤ 10.5%) on current antihyperglycemic therapies. The primary objective of this prespecified substudy was to assess change from baseline to 18 weeks in HbA1c among patients on sulfonylurea monotherapy.

Results

Of the 4330 patients enrolled in CANVAS, 127 met the entry criteria for the sulfonylurea monotherapy substudy (placebo, n = 45; canagliflozin 100 mg, n = 42; canagliflozin 300 mg, n = 40). At 18 weeks, placebo-subtracted changes (95% confidence interval) in HbA1c were -0.74% (-1.15, -0.33; P < 0.001) and -0.83% (-1.24, -0.42; P < 0.001) with canagliflozin 100 and 300 mg, respectively. Relative to placebo, canagliflozin 100 and 300 mg also decreased fasting plasma glucose (FPG; -2.1 mmol/L [-3.0, -1.2] and -2.7 mmol/L [-3.6, -1.7], respectively). Body weight was lower with canagliflozin 300 mg (-1.8% [-3.2, -0.4]; P = 0.014) but unchanged with canagliflozin 100 mg (-0.4% [-1.8, 1.0]; P = 0.557). Canagliflozin 300 mg increased hypoglycemia episodes compared to canagliflozin 100 mg and placebo (15%, 0%, and 4.4%, respectively). Adverse events (AEs) of male and female genital mycotic infections, pollakiuria, and thirst were more common with canagliflozin.

Conclusions

Canagliflozin added to ongoing sulfonylurea monotherapy produced improvements in HbA1c, FPG, and body weight, with an increased incidence of AEs consistent with the mechanism of action of SGLT2 inhibition.

Canagliflozin as Add-on Combination Therapy with Metformin HCl and Sulfonylurea

A total of 469 adult patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on the combination of metformin HCl (greater than or equal to 2,000 mg/day or at least 1,500 mg/day if higher dose not tolerated) and sulfonylurea (maximal or near-maximal effective dose) participated in a 26-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of canagliflozin in combination with metformin HCl and sulfonylurea. The mean age was 57 years, 51% of patients were male, and the mean baseline eGFR was 89 mL/min/1.73 m2. Patients already on the protocol-specified doses of metformin HCl and sulfonylurea (N = 372) entered a 2-week, single-blind, placebo run-in period. Other patients (N = 97) were required to be on a stable protocol-specified dose of metformin HCl and sulfonylurea for at least 8 weeks before entering the 2-week run-in period. Following the run-in period, patients were randomized to canagliflozin 100 mg, canagliflozin 300 mg, or placebo administered once daily as add-on to metformin HCl and sulfonylurea.

At the end of treatment, canagliflozin 100 mg and 300 mg once daily resulted in a statistically significant improvement in HbA1C(p < 0.001 for both doses) compared to placebo when added to metformin HCl and sulfonylurea. Canagliflozin 100 mg and 300 mg once daily also resulted in a greater proportion of patients achieving an HbA1Cless than 7.0%, in a significant reduction in fasting plasma glucose (FPG), and in percent body weight reduction compared to placebo when added to metformin HCl and sulfonylurea (see Table 17).

### Comparative effectiveness of insulin glargine, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors in veterans with type 2 diabetes [^114XXAsN]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a leading cause of cardiovascular disease, kidney failure, blindnessand death. In major recent randomized controlled trials (RCTs), sodium‐glucose cotransporter‐2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) dapagliflozin, canagliflozin and empagliflozin were beneficial in decreasing heart failure hospitalization, cardiovascular death and chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression. While exenatide and lixisenatide, exendin‐4 based glucagon‐like peptide‐1 receptor agonists (GLP‐1RA), did not reduce cardiovascular risk in T2D, the synthetic GLP‐1RA dulaglutide, liraglutideand semaglutide, decreased the risk of cardiovascular events, cardiovascular deaths and CKD progression.

The 2023 American Diabetes Association Guidelines recommend the use of SGLT2i and/or GLP‐1RA for T2D patients with established or high risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, heart failure and/or established kidney disease, irrespective of metformin use. The 2024 American College of Physicians (ACP) guidelines recommend the addition of SGLT2i or GLP‐1RA to metformin and lifestyle management in adults with T2D and inadequate glycaemic control. Furthermore, after evaluating the benefits and harms of SGLT2i and GLP‐1RA, the ACP Guidelines Committee could not determine the superiority of one over the other. On the other hand, a Presidential Advisory from the American Heart Association on Cardiovascular‐Kidney‐Metabolic Health suggested that SGLT2i be prioritized for those with CKD, existing heart failure or high heart failure risk and GLP‐1RA be prioritized for those with severe obesity with body mass index (BMI) ≥ 35 kg/m 2, uncontrolled hyperglycaemia with a haemoglobin A1C (HbA1C) ≥ 9% or high insulin doses. Thus, there is uncertainty about the comparative effectiveness of SGLT2i and GLP‐1RA, particularly in subgroups based on the levels of baseline HbA1C, BMI and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).

### Efficacy and safety of canagliflozin, a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor, as add-on to insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes [^112BcLys]. Diabetes Care (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

This study assessed the efficacy and safety of canagliflozin, a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor, as add-on to insulin in adults with type 1 diabetes.

Research Design and Methods

This 18-week, double-blind, phase 2 study randomized 351 patients (HbA1c 7.0–9.0% [53–75 mmol/mol]) on multiple daily insulin injections or continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion to canagliflozin 100 or 300 mg or placebo. The primary end point was the proportion of patients achieving at week 18 both HbA1c reduction from baseline of ≥ 0.4% (≥ 4.4 mmol/mol) and no increase in body weight. Other end points included changes in HbA1c, body weight, and insulin dose, as well as hypoglycemia incidence. Safety was assessed by adverse event (AE) reports.

Results

More patients had both HbA1c reduction ≥ 0.4% and no increase in body weight with canagliflozin 100 and 300 mg versus placebo at week 18 (36.9%, 41.4%, 14.5%, respectively; P < 0.001). Both canagliflozin doses provided reductions in HbA1c, body weight, and insulin dose versus placebo over 18 weeks. The incidence of hypoglycemia was similar across groups; severe hypoglycemia rates were low (1.7–6.8%). Overall incidence of AEs was 55.6%, 67.5%, and 54.7% with canagliflozin 100 and 300 mg and placebo; discontinuation rates were low (0.9–1.3%). Increased incidence of ketone-related AEs (5.1%, 9.4%, 0%), including the specific AE of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) (4.3%, 6.0%, 0%), was seen with canagliflozin 100 and 300 mg versus placebo.

Conclusions

Canagliflozin provided reductions in HbA1c, body weight, and insulin dose with no increase in hypoglycemia, but increased rates of ketone-related AEs, including DKA, in adults with type 1 diabetes inadequately controlled with insulin.

Canagliflozin as Add-on Combination Therapy with Metformin HCl and Sitagliptin

A total of 217 adult patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on the combination of metformin HCl (greater than or equal to 1,500 mg/day) and sitagliptin 100 mg/day (or equivalent fixed-dose combination) participated in a 26-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of canagliflozin in combination with metformin HCl and sitagliptin. The mean age was 57 years, 58% of patients were male, 73% of patients were White, 15% were Asian, and 12% were Black or African American. The mean baseline eGFR was 90 mL/min/1.73 m2and the mean baseline BMI was 32 kg/m2. The mean duration of diabetes was 10 years. Eligible patients entered a 2-week, single-blind, placebo run-in period and were subsequently randomized to canagliflozin 100 mg or placebo, administered once daily as add-on to metformin HCl and sitagliptin. Patients with a baseline eGFR of 70 mL/min/1.73 m2or greater who were tolerating canagliflozin 100 mg and who required additional glycemic control (fasting finger stick 100 mg/dL or greater at least twice within 2 weeks) were up-titrated to canagliflozin 300 mg. While up-titration occurred as early as Week 4, most (90%) patients randomized to canagliflozin were up-titrated to canagliflozin 300 mg by 6 to 8 weeks.

At the end of 26 weeks, canagliflozin once daily resulted in a statistically significant improvement in HbA1C(p < 0.001) compared to placebo when added to metformin HCl and sitagliptin (see Table 16).

14.1 Glycemic Control Trials in Adults with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus

The effectiveness of INVOKAMET and INVOKAMET XR have been established in clinical trials with canagliflozin in combination with metformin HCl alone, metformin HCl and sulfonylurea, metformin HCl and sitagliptin, metformin HCl and a thiazolidinedione (i.e., pioglitazone), and metformin HCl and insulin (with or without other anti-hyperglycemic agents). The efficacy of canagliflozin was compared to a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor (sitagliptin), both as add-on combination therapy with metformin HCl and sulfonylurea, and a sulfonylurea (glimepiride), both as add-on combination therapy with metformin HCl.

Canagliflozin as Initial Combination Therapy with Metformin HCl Extended-Release

A total of 1,186 adult patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with diet and exercise participated in a 26-week double-blind, active-controlled, parallel-group, 5-arm, multicenter trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of initial therapy with canagliflozin in combination with metformin HCl extended-release. The median age was 56 years, 48% of patients were male, and the mean baseline eGFR was 87.6 mL/min/1.73 m2. The median duration of diabetes was 1.6 years, and 72% of patients were treatment naïve. After completing a 2-week single-blind placebo run-in period, patients were randomly assigned for a double-blind treatment period of 26 weeks to 1 of 5 treatment groups (Table 13). The metformin HCl extended-release dose was initiated at 500 mg/day for the first week of treatment and then increased to 1,000 mg/day. Metformin HCl extended-release or matching placebo was up-titrated every 2–3 weeks during the next 8 weeks of treatment to a maximum daily dose of 1,500 to 2,000 mg/day, as tolerated; about 90% of patients reached 2,000 mg/day.

At the end of treatment, canagliflozin 100 mg and canagliflozin 300 mg in combination with metformin HCl extended-release resulted in a statistically significant greater improvement in HbA1Ccompared to their respective canagliflozin doses (100 mg and 300 mg) alone or metformin HCl extended-release alone.

3.1 Demographic and baseline characteristics

A total of 538 patients were screened for the CanCARE study, of whom 527 patients were enrolled at 28 Canadian sites and were included in the final analysis set for effectiveness and safety. Eleven (2.0%) patients were excluded from analysis because they did not meet one or more of the eligibility criteria. The number of participants for whom HbA1c data were available within the required reporting window of ± 45 days was: baseline, 509; 3 months, 435; 6 months, 376 and 12 months, 321. Patient demographics are summarized in Table 1. Overall baseline demographic and disease characteristics were consistent with eligibility criteria and were representative of the Canadian T2DM patient population. 5

Table 1
Baseline characteristics of patients included in the study

Mean baseline HbA1c was 8.5%, with a mean T2DM duration of 9.8 years. Patients enrolled in the study were treated by community specialists (39.3%) or primary care practitioners (60.7%). At baseline, CANA treatment was initiated, either as monotherapy or as add‐on therapy to multiple AHAs, including one or more oral and injectable agents. With respect to dosing patterns, 83.1% (438/527) of patients received CANA 100 mg and 16.5% (87/527) received CANA 300 mg at study initiation. Two patients (0.7%) initially received CANA 200 mg. Among 351 participants who completed the 12‐month study, 58.2% were receiving CANA 100 mg and 41.5% were receiving CANA 300 mg. A total of 77% percent of patients who completed the study reported not missing a single dose of CANA throughout the duration of the study. A very low percentage of patients (~4%) received CANA as monotherapy from baseline through Months 6 and 12. At initiation, most patients (75.9%) received CANA in combination with two AHAs. The proportion of patients receiving CANA according to different AHA regimens at baseline, and at 6 and 12 month was: insulin, with or without an oral AHA (24.3%, 24.4% and 23.9%, respectively), metformin alone (19.7%, 18.6% and 19.8%, respectively), metformin and DPP‐4 inhibitors (17.1%, 16.5% and 16.0%, respectively), metformin and sulfonylureas (12.7%, 13.1%, and 13.9%, respectively) or metformin + sulfonylureas + DPP‐4 inhibitors (12.3%, 12.7%, and 16.0%, respectively).

14.3 Cardiovascular Outcomes in Adults with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease

The CANVAS and CANVAS-R trials were multicenter, multi-national, randomized, double-blind parallel group, with similar inclusion and exclusion criteria. Patients eligible for enrollment in both CANVAS and CANVAS-R trials were: 30 years of age or older and had established, stable, cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, peripheral artery disease (66% of the enrolled population) or were 50 years of age or older and had two or more other specified risk factors for cardiovascular disease (34% of the enrolled population).

The integrated analysis of the CANVAS and CANVAS-R trials compared the risk of Major Adverse Cardiovascular Event (MACE) between canagliflozin and placebo when these were added to and used concomitantly with standard of care treatments for diabetes and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. The primary endpoint, MACE, was the time to first occurrence of a three-part composite outcome which included cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction and non-fatal stroke.

In CANVAS, patients were randomly assigned 1:1:1 to canagliflozin 100 mg, canagliflozin 300 mg, or matching placebo. In CANVAS-R, patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to canagliflozin 100 mg or matching placebo, and titration to 300 mg was permitted at the investigator's discretion (based on tolerability and glycemic needs) after Week 13. Concomitant antidiabetic and atherosclerotic therapies could be adjusted, at the discretion of investigators, to ensure participants were treated according to the standard care for these diseases.

### Efficacy and safety of canagliflozin by baseline HbA1c and known duration of type 2 diabetes mellitus [^116HJUmG]. Journal of Diabetes and Its Complications (2015). Low credibility.

Aims

Canagliflozin, a sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor, has demonstrated glycemic improvements across studies of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The impact of canagliflozin on HbA1c lowering was assessed by baseline HbA1c and known duration of T2DM.

Methods

This post hoc analysis pooled data from patients with T2DM enrolled in four 26-week, placebo-controlled, Phase 3 studies of canagliflozin (N = 2313). Change in HbA1c from baseline to Week 26 was assessed in the overall population and in subgroups by baseline HbA1c (< 8.0%, 8.0%- < 9.0%, and ≥ 9.0%) and known duration of T2DM (< 5 years, 5- < 10 years, and ≥ 10 years).

Results

Relative to placebo, canagliflozin 100 and 300 mg provided greater HbA1c reductions in the overall population. Progressively larger placebo-subtracted reductions in HbA1c with canagliflozin 100 and 300 mg were seen with increasing baseline HbA1c. HbA1c reductions were similar across subgroups based on known duration of T2DM. Both canagliflozin doses were generally well tolerated across subgroups, with a safety and tolerability profile consistent with that seen in Phase 3 studies.

Conclusions

Canagliflozin provided glycemic improvements in patients with T2DM across a range of baseline HbA1c and known duration of T2DM.

### Impact of empagliflozin added on to basal insulin in type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on basal insulin: a 78-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^111yMhqm]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

The present study comprised two distinct treatment phases to assess the efficacy and safety of empagliflozin as add‐on to basal insulin: an 18‐week period during which the insulin dose was to remain fixed, to directly assess the drug effect, followed by a 60‐week period in which the insulin dose could be adjusted at the discretion of the investigator with the recommendation to treat to a fasting glucose target. Minimal insulin adjustments were made during this period, as there was no glucose monitoring committee enforcing insulin titrations, probably reflecting clinical practice, in which insulin algorithms are not systematically executed. Treatment with empagliflozin 10 and 25 mg for 18 weeks led to mean reductions from baseline in HbA1c of 0.6 and 0.7% (6.2 and 7.8 mmol/mol), respectively, to mean levels close to 7.5% (58 mmol/mol), in contrast to no change in HbA1c in the placebo group. These reductions in HbA1c were largely sustained up to week 78 despite minimal reductions in the dose of insulin in the empagliflozin groups, contrasting with slight insulin dose increments in the placebo group. The option to adjust basal insulin dose between weeks 18 and 78 differs from previous studies investigating oral agents as add‐on to insulin, in which the insulin dose was to remain stable 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, and is more akin to clinical practice; however, it is conceivable that greater proportions of patients would have achieved target HbA1c levels had investigators been required to systematically adjust insulin doses.

While an increase in weight was observed with placebo, sustained weight loss was observed in the empagliflozin groups, likely due to urinary glucose excretion and mild osmotic diuresis. Weight control is an important issue in the management of patients with type 2 diabetes, particularly in patients taking insulin 21, 22, 23. It has been estimated that with insulin therapy, a 1% decrease in HbA1c level is associated with a 2‐kg weight gain over 1 year 24, and it is remarkable that with empagliflozin, despite a 0.7% reduction in HbA1c, weight was reduced by 2 kg. Weight gain may worsen insulin resistance, resulting in the need for an increased dose of insulin, which may cause further weight gain 23, 25, and can reduce patients' adherence to insulin regimens 22; thus, the decrease in body weight observed with empagliflozin suggests this agent could be of particular benefit when used as add‐on to insulin.

Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors in older adults — SGLT2 inhibitors reduce HbA1c by ~0.8%, can reduce weight, and do not cause hypoglycemia; empagliflozin and canagliflozin have been shown to decrease major adverse cardiovascular events, heart failure, and the progression of CKD; these compounds cause an obligate increase in urine volume and an increase in urogenital candida infections, and because adverse effects related to volume depletion were more frequent in older patients treated with canagliflozin, recommendations limit the dosage to 100 mg/d in such patients.

Methods

Study Design, Participant Populations, and Treatments

Efficacy analyses were performed using pooled data from individuals with T2DM enrolled in six double‐blind, placebo‐controlled Phase 3 studies and substudies of 18 or 26 weeks duration (N = 4,158; efficacy population), including canagliflozin as monotherapy, 11 add‐on to metformin, 16 add‐on to metformin plus sulfonylurea, 17 and add‐on to metformin plus pioglitazone 20 and the CANagliflozin cardioVascular Assessment Study (CANVAS) add‐on to sulfonylurea 30 and add‐on to insulin 31 substudies, which included 183 participants aged 75 and older (Table 1). In each study, participants were randomized to receive canagliflozin 100 or 300 mg or placebo once daily. A high‐glycemic substudy (baseline glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA 1c) > 10.0–12.0%) of the monotherapy study 11 was not placebo controlled and therefore not included in this analysis. Safety and tolerability were assessed in a broader population of participants with T2DM enrolled in eight double‐blind, placebo‐ and active‐controlled Phase 3 studies (N = 9,439; safety population), which included 490 participants aged 75 and older (Table 1). The safety population included the four 26‐week studies above, 11, 16, 17, 20 a 52‐week study of canagliflozin as add‐on to metformin vs glimepiride, 15 a 26‐week study of individuals aged 55 to 80, 14 and a 26‐week study of individuals with moderate renal impairment (baseline eGFR 30 to < 50 mL/min per 1.73 m 2). 19 Safety analyses also included all participants enrolled in CANVAS (an ongoing event‐driven study), not just the prespecified substudies included in the efficacy population, through a cutoff date of September 15, 2011.

### Long-term efficacy and safety of canagliflozin in combination with insulin in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^113nviEX]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

Aim

The aim of this study was to assess the long-term efficacy and safety of canagliflozin as add-on therapy in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who had inadequate glycaemic control with insulin.

Materials and Methods

The study comprised a 16-week, double-blind period in which patients were randomized to either placebo (P; N = 70) or canagliflozin (100mg, CAN; N = 76), followed by a 36-week open-label period in which all patients received canagliflozin. The efficacy endpoints included the change in HbA1c from baseline to end of treatment. The safety endpoints were adverse events, hypoglycaemic events, and laboratory test values.

Results

The changes from baseline (mean ± standard deviation, last observation carried forward) in the P/CAN and CAN/CAN groups, respectively, were -1.09% ± 0.85% and -0.88% ± 0.86% for HbA1c, -1.40% ± 2.54% and -2.14% ± 2.75% for body weight, and 7.84% ± 14.37% and 8.91% ± 10.80% for HOMA2-%B (all, P < .001). Adverse events occurred in 85.1% of the P/CAN group and 92.0% of the CAN/CAN group. Hypoglycaemic events occurred in 43.3% and 54.7%, respectively. All hypoglycaemic events were mild in severity and insulin dose reduction decreased the incidence rate of hypoglycaemic events. Post-hoc ordinal logistic modelling/logistic modelling showed that lower serum C-peptide at Week 0 was a risk factor for hypoglycaemia in both the P and CAN groups in the double-blind period as well as in the canagliflozin all-treatment period.

Conclusions

This study demonstrates the long-term efficacy and safety of canagliflozin combined with insulin in Japanese patients.

### Ertugliflozin compared to other anti-hyperglycemic agents as monotherapy and add-on therapy in type 2 diabetes: a systematic literature review and network meta-analysis [^114JYAMF]. Diabetes Therapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In summary, the current NMA found that ertugliflozin may be more effective in lowering HbA1c than dapagliflozin and empagliflozin in patients uncontrolled on diet and exercise as well as those on therapy with metformin alone. The analysis did not find differences in the HbA1c reductions associated with ertugliflozin compared to canagliflozin across all populations evaluated. The degree to which the efficacy and safety found in short-term studies translate to effects on long-term complications of T2DM, most notably cardiovascular and renal events, is of considerable interest. Completed studies for empagliflozin, canagliflozin and dapagliflozin have shown reductions in cardiovascular outcomes. VERTIS CV, an ongoing outcomes trial, will evaluate the effects of ertugliflozin versus standard of care for cardiovascular and renal outcomes.

Endocrine Society — sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors in CKD: SGLT2 inhibitors generally become less effective as GFR decreases, and because of a small increase in adverse events related to intravascular volume contraction, no more than 100 mg once daily of canagliflozin should be used in patients with an eGFR of 45 to < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2. Canagliflozin, empagliflozin, and ertugliflozin should be stopped if the eGFR is < 45 mL/min/1.73 m2, and dapagliflozin should be stopped at 60 mL/min/1.73 m2, primarily because of a decrease in efficacy. Interestingly, empagliflozin and canagliflozin have been shown to delay the progression of CKD.

### Dapagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: a pooled analysis of safety data from phase IIb / III clinical trials [^1158WbpX]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

This pooled analysis reports the safety findings for dapagliflozin, including the newer emergent safety issues of ketoacidosis and lower limb amputation, thereby adding to the knowledge of the safety of this agent in patients with T2DM. This analysis identified no new safety signals for dapagliflozin.

The risk of hypoglycaemia associated with SGLT2 inhibitors is low, as suggested by their mechanism of action and clinical experience to date, and a similar incidence of hypoglycaemia was observed between dapagliflozin and placebo in the analysis reported here. In a pooled analysis of empagliflozin trials, 23.1%, 22.7% and 22.7% of patients receiving empagliflozin 10 and 25 mg and placebo, respectively, reported AEs of hypoglycaemia. 12 In a pooled analysis of canagliflozin trials, AEs of hypoglycaemia were reported for 6.9%, 4.1% and 2.9% of patients receiving canagliflozin 100 and 300 mg, and placebo, respectively, as monotherapy, and for 44.4%, 49.4%, and 34.0% of patients, respectively, who were also receiving background antihyperglycaemic drugs. 14

Canagliflozin as Add-on Combination Therapy with Metformin HCl and Pioglitazone

A total of 342 adult patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on the combination of metformin HCl (greater than or equal to 2,000 mg/day or at least 1,500 mg/day if higher dose not tolerated) and pioglitazone (30 or 45 mg/day) participated in a 26-week, double — blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of canagliflozin in combination with metformin HCl and pioglitazone. The mean age was 57 years, 63% of patients were male, and the mean baseline eGFR was 86 mL/min/1.73 m2. Patients already on protocol-specified doses of metformin HCl and pioglitazone (N = 163) entered a 2-week, single-blind, placebo run-in period. Other patients (N = 181) were required to be on stable protocol-specified doses of metformin HCl and pioglitazone for at least 8 weeks before entering the 2-week run-in period. Following the run-in period, patients were randomized to canagliflozin 100 mg, canagliflozin 300 mg, or placebo, administered once daily as add-on to metformin HCl and pioglitazone.

At the end of treatment, canagliflozin 100 mg and 300 mg once daily resulted in a statistically significant improvement in HbA1C(p < 0.001 for both doses) compared to placebo when added to metformin HCl and pioglitazone. Canagliflozin 100 mg and 300 mg once daily also resulted in a greater proportion of patients achieving an HbA1Cless than 7%, in significant reduction in fasting plasma glucose (FPG), and in percent body weight reduction compared to placebo when added to metformin HCl and pioglitazone (see Table 19). Statistically significant (p < 0.05 for both doses) mean changes from baseline in systolic blood pressure relative to placebo were -4.1 mmHg and -3.5 mmHg with canagliflozin 100 mg and 300 mg, respectively.

Combination with Metformin Plus Other AHAs

Significant reductions in systolic BP were seen with canagliflozin 100 and 300 mg versus placebo as add-on to metformin plus pioglitazone at week 26 (p < 0.01 and p < 0.025, respectively). At week 52, reductions in systolic BP were −3.4 and −3.7 mmHg with canagliflozin 100 and 300 mg, respectively.

In the placebo-controlled add-on to metformin plus sulfonylurea study, canagliflozin 100 and 300 mg provided numerical reductions in systolic BP versus placebo over 26 weeks. At week 52, changes in systolic BP were −3.7, −2.9, and 0.1 mmHg with canagliflozin 100 and 300 mg and placebo, respectively. In the head-to-head study of canagliflozin as add-on to metformin plus sulfonylurea, canagliflozin 300 mg significantly lowered systolic BP versus sitagliptin 100 mg over 52 weeks (p < 0.001). In the metformin plus sulfonylurea stratum of the study in Asian patients, larger changes in systolic BP were seen with canagliflozin 100 and 300 mg compared with placebo at week 18.

In the subset of CANVAS patients on metformin plus insulin, reductions in systolic BP were seen with canagliflozin 100 and 300 mg compared with placebo at week 18 (p < 0.001 for canagliflozin 300 mg versus placebo).

Efficacy of Canagliflozin Monotherapy Versus Metformin

The initial combination study also evaluated the efficacy and safety of canagliflozin 100 and 300 mg monotherapy versus metformin in treatment-naïve patients with T2DM. Canagliflozin 100 and 300 mg demonstrated noninferiority in lowering HbA1c versus metformin at week 26 (noninferiority p = 0.001; Fig. 1). Body weight reductions were significantly greater with canagliflozin 100 and 300 mg versus metformin (p = 0.016 and p = 0.002, respectively; Fig. 2). Reductions in systolic BP were also observed with canagliflozin 100 and 300 mg compared with metformin (Fig. 3).

### Canagliflozin for the treatment of diabetic kidney disease and implications for clinical practice: a narrative review [^111YCT2n]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Renal outcomes data for people with DKD are not yet available for other SGLT2 inhibitors; however, trials for the SGLT2 inhibitors dapagliflozin and empagliflozin that include this population as well as people with CKD (without T2DM) are ongoing and expected to be completed in late 2020 and 2022, respectively. These data may help to clarify whether the renal benefits seen with canagliflozin in CREDENCE trial participants are a class effect of SGLT2 inhibitors and whether these effects may extend to people with CKD who do not have T2DM to further establish the renal efficacy and safety of this class of drugs.

The results from the CREDENCE trial prompted the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to expand the indication for canagliflozin to a new patient population. Prior to CREDENCE, canagliflozin was approved for two indications: (1) as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with T2DM and (2) to reduce the risk of MACE in adults with T2DM and established cardiovascular disease. On the basis of results from the CREDENCE trial, the FDA approved canagliflozin to reduce the risk of ESKD, doubling of serum creatinine, cardiovascular death, and hospitalization for heart failure in adults with T2DM and diabetic nephropathy with albuminuria (> 300 mg/day). The US prescribing information for canagliflozin was also updated to allow the continuation of canagliflozin 100 mg in people already receiving therapy whose eGFR falls to < 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 with a UACR > 300 mg/g until initiation of dialysis or kidney transplantation. Evidence from the CREDENCE trial also prompted the American Diabetes Association to update its guidelines in June 2019 to recommend that people with T2DM with an eGFR ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 and albuminuria (> 300 mg/g) consider using an SGLT2 inhibitor to reduce their risk of DKD progression and/or cardiovascular events. Further updates to these guidelines published in 2020 suggested that SGLT2 inhibitors should be considered independently of HbA1c for people when atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, heart failure, or CKD predominates or for people with T2DM and CKD who require treatment in addition to metformin to attain target HbA1c. Taken together, these new recommendations demonstrate that canagliflozin treatment is beneficial to a diverse array of people in a broad range of circumstances, and physicians should consider the unique characteristics of each patient when determining if canagliflozin is an appropriate treatment option (Fig. 8).

SGLT2 inhibitor use to manage ASCVD, HF, and DKD risk in type 2 diabetes follows this algorithm: Patient is ≥ 18 years old with T2D and ≥ 1 of the following: ASCVD, HF, DKD, or at high risk for ASCVD. If the patient is pregnant or breast feeding, do not start an SGLT2 inhibitor (no safety data available). If the patient's eGFR < 30 ml/min/1.73m^2, do not start an SGLT2 inhibitor. If not, consider starting an SGLT2 inhibitor with proven ASCVD, HF, or DKD benefit; after a discussion incorporating patient-clinician preferences and priorities, if the patient wishes to initiate an SGLT2 inhibitor, initiate an SGLT2 inhibitor with proven ASCVD, HF, or DKD benefit. Canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, or empagliflozin is appropriate. No dose titration is required. Adjust other antihyperglycemic therapies if necessary. Monitor response to therapy and consider further therapies for CV risk reduction, as indicated. This may include the addition of a GLP-1RA in the appropriate patient.

### The effect of canagliflozin, a sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor, on glycemic end points assessed by continuous glucose monitoring and patient-reported outcomes among people with type 1 diabetes [^115e4MmH]. Diabetes Care (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the effects of canagliflozin, a sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor, on glycemic parameters and measures of glucose variability assessed by a 9-point self-monitoring blood glucose (SMBG) and continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) profiles, and patient-reported outcomes as an add-on to insulin among participants with type 1 diabetes.

Research Design and Methods

In this randomized, double-blind study, 351 participants received canagliflozin 100 or 300 mg or placebo for 18 weeks. Change from baseline in daily mean glucose and SD was measured using a 9-point SMBG profile. In a subset of 89 participants who underwent CGM, the change from baseline in mean glucose, measures of glycemic variability (SD, coefficient of variation, and mean amplitude of glycemic excursions), and time spent in glycemic ranges were assessed. Change in treatment satisfaction was evaluated using the Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (n = 328).

Results

At week 18, reductions in daily mean glucose and SD measured using the 9-point SMBG profile were seen with canagliflozin 100 and 300 mg versus placebo. Reductions in mean glucose (-1.2, -0.7, and 0.6 mmol/L) and measures of glycemic variability assessed by CGM, such as changes in glucose SD (-0.3, -0.7, and 0.1 mmol/L), were also seen with canagliflozin 100 and 300 mg versus placebo, respectively. Canagliflozin 100 and 300 mg were associated with increases in time spent within target (glucose > 3.9 to ≤ 10.0 mmol/L) compared with placebo (11.6%, 10.1%, and -3.5%, respectively) and commensurate reductions in time spent above the target level (glucose > 10.0 mmol/L; -12.7%,-7.6%, and 5.7%, respectively). Participants showed greater improvement in treatment satisfaction with canagliflozin versus placebo; reductions in insulin dose, SD of glucose, and body weight contributed to the relationship between canagliflozin and satisfaction change.

Conclusions

Canagliflozin improved indices of glycemic variability and was associated with improvement in treatment satisfaction versus placebo over 18 weeks among participants with type 1 diabetes. Although these data from this study demonstrate the potential benefits of canagliflozin in people with type 1 diabetes, canagliflozin is not approved for the treatment of type 1 diabetes and should not currently be used in people with type 1 diabetes.

### Initial combination therapy with canagliflozin plus metformin versus each component as monotherapy for drug-Naïve type 2 diabetes [^116AkZdv]. Diabetes Care (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

This study assessed the efficacy/safety of canagliflozin (CANA), a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, plus metformin extended-release (MET) initial therapy in drug-naïve type 2 diabetes.

Research Design and Methods

This 26-week, double-blind, phase 3 study randomized 1,186 patients to CANA 100 mg (CANA100)/MET, CANA 300 mg (CANA300)/MET, CANA100, CANA300, or MET. Primary end point was change in HbA(1c) at week 26 for combinations versus monotherapies. Secondary end points included noninferiority in HbA(1c) lowering with CANA monotherapy versus MET; changes in fasting plasma glucose, body weight, and blood pressure; and proportion of patients achieving HbA(1c) < 7.0% (< 53 mmol/mol).

Results

From mean baseline HbA(1c) of 8.8% (73 mmol/mol), CANA100/MET and CANA300/MET significantly lowered HbA(1c) versus MET (median dose, 2,000 mg/day) by -1.77%, -1.78%, and -1.30% (-19.3, -19.5, and -14.2 mmol/mol; differences of -0.46% and -0.48% [-5.0 and -5.2 mmol/mol]; P = 0.001) and versus CANA100 and CANA300 by -1.37% and -1.42% (-15.0 and -15.5 mmol/mol; differences of -0.40% and -0.36% [-4.4 and -3.9 mmol/mol]; P = 0.001). CANA100 and CANA300 monotherapy met noninferiority for HbA(1c) lowering and had significantly more weight loss versus MET (-2.8, -3.7, and -1.9 kg [-3.0%, -3.9%, and -2.1%]; P = 0.016 and P = 0.002). Greater attainment of HbA(1c) < 7.0% (50%, 57%, and 43%) and significantly more weight loss (-3.2, -3.9, and -1.9 kg [-3.5%, -4.2%, and -2.1%]; P = 0.001) occurred with CANA100/MET and CANA300/MET versus MET. The incidence of adverse events (AEs) related to SGLT2 inhibition (genital mycotic infections, osmotic diuresis- and volume depletion-related AEs) was higher in the CANA arms (0.4–4.4%) versus MET (0–0.8%). AE-related discontinuation rates were 1.3–3.0% across groups. The incidence of hypoglycemia was 3.0–5.5% in the CANA arms and 4.6% with MET.

Conclusions

Initial therapy with CANA plus MET was more effective and generally well tolerated versus each monotherapy in drug-naïve type 2 diabetes. CANA monotherapy demonstrated noninferior HbA1c lowering versus MET.

Consensus recommendations for the management of T2DM in patients with corresponding high risk/history of CVD

The results of all the below mentioned CVOTs are summarized in Table 2. Based on these CVOTs and years of expertise, the authors have come up with the treatment approaches for T2DM patients with high risk/history of CVDs.

Management of T2DM in patients at a risk of CVD

Figure 1 describes the consensus approach to glucose lowering with AHAs in this set of population. For patients not reaching their target HbA1c, it is advisable to assess adherence and arrange timely follow-up every 3 months.

Fig. 1
Evidence-based algorithm for the management of patients with T2DM and high risk of CVD. CVD cardiovascular disease, GLP-1 glucagon-like peptide-1, SGLT2 sodium–glucose transporter proteins-2, TZD thiazolidinedione, DPP4 dipeptidylpeptidase-4. a Proven CVD benefits means the agent has a label indication of reducing the CVD events. For SGLT2 inhibitors evidence based preference is empagliflozin > canagliflozin. SGLT2 inhibitors vary in regards to eGFR pre-requisites for a continued use. b For GLP-1 agonist evidence based preference is Semaglutide > Liraglutide > Dulaglutide > Exenatide > Lixenatide. Caution to be exercised in case of end-stage renal disease. c Degludec and insulin Glargine (U100) have shown CVD safety, d Dapagliflozin: preferred option for patients with eGFR > 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2, e Low dose TZDs are better tolerated. f Choose later generation SU to minimize the risk of hypoglycaemia

Recommendation: we recommend using metformin alone or in combination with other drugs as first line therapy in patients with T2DM and high risk of CVD (Grade A)

One of the earliest CVOTs in T2DM patients, UKPDS 34, determined whether a policy of reducing hyperglycaemia to near-normal levels will reduce the risk of development or progression of diabetes-related complications. Metformin was among the intensive control group, which demonstrated statistically significant reductions in the risk of MI and CV death. This rendered metformin a drug of choice in the view of previously available insulin and sulphonylurea that had risk of hypoglycaemia and weight gain. With a long-standing experience and global use of metformin, the Food and Drug Administration removed boxed warnings contraindicating its use in patients with HF in 2006, and liberalized contraindications for those with kidney disease in 2016.

### Efficacy and safety of once-weekly semaglutide versus daily canagliflozin as add-on to metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes (SUSTAIN 8): a double-blind, phase 3b, randomised controlled trial [^1128HX8r]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2019). High credibility.

Background

Existing guidelines for management of type 2 diabetes recommend a patient-centred approach to guide the choice of pharmacological agents. Although glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are increasingly used as second-line agents, direct comparisons between these treatments are insufficient. In the SUSTAIN 8 trial, we compared the efficacy and safety of semaglutide (a GLP-1 receptor agonist) with canagliflozin (an SGLT2 inhibitor) in patients with type 2 diabetes.

Methods

This was a double-blind, parallel-group, phase 3b, randomised controlled trial done at 111 centres in 11 countries. Eligible patients were at least 18 years old and had uncontrolled type 2 diabetes (HbA 1c 7·0–10·5% [53–91 mmol/mol]) on stable daily metformin therapy. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) by use of an interactive web response system to subcutaneous semaglutide 1·0 mg once weekly or oral canagliflozin 300 mg once daily. The primary endpoint was change from baseline in HbA 1c, and the confirmatory secondary endpoint was change from baseline in bodyweight, both at week 52. The primary analysis population included all randomly assigned patients, using on-treatment data collected before initiation of rescue medication. The safety analysis was done on a population that included all patients exposed to at least one dose of trial product. The trial was powered for HbA 1c and bodyweight superiority under reasonable assumptions. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03136484.

Findings

Between March 15, 2017, and Nov 16, 2018, 788 patients were randomly assigned to semaglutide 1·0 mg (394 patients) or canagliflozin 300 mg (394 patients). 739 patients completed the trial (367 in the semaglutide group and 372 in the canagliflozin group). From overall baseline mean, patients receiving semaglutide had significantly greater reductions in HbA 1c and bodyweight than those receiving canagliflozin (HbA 1c estimated treatment difference [ETD] -0·49 percentage points, 95% CI -0·65 to -0·33; -5·34 mmol/mol, 95% CI -7·10 to -3·57; p < 0·0001; and bodyweight ETD -1·06 kg, 95% CI -1·76 to -0·36; p = 0·0029). Gastrointestinal disorders, most commonly nausea, were the most frequently reported adverse events with semaglutide, occurring in 184 (47%) of 392 patients; whereas infections and infestations (defined using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities, version 21.0), most commonly urinary tract infections, occurred more frequently with canagliflozin, in 136 (35%) of 394 patients. Premature treatment discontinuation because of adverse events occurred in 38 (10%) of 392 patients with semaglutide and in 20 (5%) of 394 patients with canagliflozin. One fatal adverse event confirmed unlikely to be caused by treatment occurred in the semaglutide group.

Interpretation

Once-weekly semaglutide 1·0 mg was superior to daily canagliflozin 300 mg in reducing HbA 1c and bodyweight in patients with type 2 diabetes uncontrolled on metformin therapy. These outcomes might guide treatment intensification choices.

### Efficacy, safety and regulatory status of SGLT2 inhibitors: focus on canagliflozin [^115svyFC]. Nutrition & Diabetes (2014). Low credibility.

The improvement in glycaemic control in T2DM patients achieved by SGLT2 inhibition also led to the consideration to use SGLT2 inhibitors in conjunction with insulin therapy in type 1 diabetes mellitus. So far, only limited data from studies with type 1 diabetic patients are available. Studies with empagliflozin in streptozotocin-induced diabetic ratsand results from a Phase II trial indicate beneficial effects of SGLT2 inhibition on reducing HbA 1c, body weight, total daily insulin dose and hypoglycaemic events. Further studies with empagliflozin and other SGLT2 inhibitors are currently underway to prove their efficacy and safety in type 1 diabetes mellitus patients.

Canagliflozin therapy not only was effective in improving glucose metabolism. The induced glucosuria of 70 g per day additionally leads to an energy deficit of 300 kcal per day, which translates into a body weight reduction of −1.84 and −2.43 kg (100 and 300 mg canagliflozin, respectively). Interestingly, weight loss stabilizes after a couple of weeks, even so glucosuria persists and calorie loss is maintained. Compensatory mechanisms such as increased food intake might explain these findings. That weight loss was indeed caused by loss of fat mass and not osmotic diuresis could be shown by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry body composition analysis in clinical trials, a diagnostic technique that can distinguish between fat, bone mineral and other fat-free mass that does not include bone. The weight-reducing characteristics of SGLT2 inhibitors in T2DM patients also might be effective in non-diabetic overweight subjects. This not only creates the option to widen the indication for the use of SGLT2 inhibitors as antiobesity drugs, but also poses the risk for drug abuse, for instance, as a weight-reducing agent or doping compound.

Under canagliflozin therapy, a clinically relevant lowering of systolic (−3.9 and −5.3 mmHg for the 100 and 300 mg dose, respectively) and diastolic (−2.1 and −2.5 mm Hg for the 100 and 300 mg dose, respectively) blood pressure was observed in placebo-controlled studies, which is a desirable additional effect of canagliflozin and not usually expected for a glucose-lowering drug. This was not accompanied by an increased compensatory heart rate. Blood pressure reduction correlates with a mild diuretic effect and haemoconcentration (reflected by increased haemoglobin and haematocrit) observed during canagliflozin treatment. Whether the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system is counter-regulatory activated upon canagliflozin treatment as observed in patients with genetic loss of SLC5A2 (familial renal glucosuria)is currently under investigation.

Case presentation

Our case series involved three patients. Chart reviews of each patient were completed in November 2016, which included printed notes from the referring physicians, blood work and Intensive Dietary Management (IDM) clinic notes from each visit. On the initial consultation, all patients had been receiving various pharmacological therapies for their T2D, including at least 70 units of insulin daily. Patients were then seen monthly thereafter. Patient characteristics are summarised in table 1.

Table 1
Patient characteristics

Patient 1 is a 40-year-old man diagnosed with T2D for 20 years. Other significant medical history includes hypertension and hypercholesterolaemia. His diabetic pharmacotherapy at the time of admission was insulin glargine 58 units at bedtime, insulin aspart 22 units twice daily, canagliflozin 300 mg once daily and metformin 1 g twice daily.

Patient 2 is a 52-year-old man diagnosed with T2D for 25 years. Other significant medical history includes chronic kidney disease, renal cell carcinoma (treated with previous nephrectomy), hypertension and hypercholesterolaemia. His diabetic pharmacotherapy at the time of admission consisted of insulin lispro mix units −38/32 25 IU twice daily.

Patient 3 is a 67-year-old man diagnosed with T2D for 10 years. Other significant medical history includes hypertension and hypercholesterolaemia. His diabetic pharmacotherapy at the time of admission consisted of metformin 1 g twice daily and insulin lispro mix 25–30 units in the morning and 20 units at night.

### Canagliflozin improves glycaemic control over 28 days in subjects with type 2 diabetes not optimally controlled on insulin [^116YxhV8]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

Aim

Canagliflozin is a sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor that is being investigated for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

Methods

This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, 28-day study conducted at two sites, in 29 subjects with T2DM not optimally controlled on insulin and up to one oral antihyperglycaemic agent. Subjects were treated with canagliflozin 100 mg QD or 300 mg twice daily (BID) or placebo. Safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic characteristics and pharmacodynamic effects of canagliflozin were examined. Glucose malabsorption following a 75-g oral glucose challenge was also examined.

Results

Canagliflozin pharmacokinetics were dose-dependent, and the elimination half-life ranged from 12 to 15 h. After 28 days, the renal threshold for glucose excretion was reduced; urinary glucose excretion was increased; and A1C, fasting plasma glucose and body weight decreased in subjects administered canagliflozin (A1C reductions: 0.19% with placebo, 0.73% with 100 mg QD, 0.92% with 300 mg BID; body weight changes: 0.03 kg increase with placebo, 0.73 kg reduction with 100 mg QD, 1.19 kg reduction with 300 mg BID). Glucose malabsorption was not observed with canagliflozin treatment. There were no deaths, serious adverse events or severe hypoglycaemic episodes. The incidence of adverse events was similar across groups. There were no clinically meaningful changes in routine laboratory safety tests, vital signs or electrocardiograms.

Conclusion

In subjects receiving insulin and oral antihyperglycaemic therapy, canagliflozin was well tolerated without evidence for glucose malabsorption, had pharmacokinetic characteristics consistent with once-daily dosing, and improved glycaemic control.

### SGLT2 inhibitors as adjunctive therapy for type 1 diabetes: balancing benefits and risks [^113vJezQ]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2019). High credibility.

Sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have several beneficial effects in patients with type 2 diabetes, including glucose lowering, weight loss, blood pressure lowering, and a reduced risk of major adverse cardiovascular events. To address high unmet medical need via improved glycaemic control, several clinical trials have been done to assess the efficacy and safety of SGLT2 inhibitors in combination with insulin therapy in patients with type 1 diabetes. In this Personal View, we summarise data from eight clinical trials of canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, empagliflozin, and sotagliflozin in patients with type 1 diabetes. HbA 1c -lowering efficacy was greatest at 8–12 weeks of therapy, but the magnitude of HbA 1c lowering waned with longer duration of treatment (up to 52 weeks). Data are not yet available to establish for how long glycaemic efficacy could be sustained during long-term therapy in patients with type 1 diabetes. Moreover, SGLT2 inhibitor therapy induces serious adverse events, including a roughly six-times increased risk of diabetic ketoacidosis. The US Food and Drug Administration estimated that one additional case of ketoacidosis will occur for every 26 patient-years of exposure of patients with type 1 diabetes to sotagliflozin therapy. Assuming a case mortality of 0·4%, this estimate translates into 16 additional deaths per year per 100000 patients with type 1 diabetes undergoing treatment. These considerations raise important questions about the risk-to-benefit profile of SGLT2 inhibitors when used as adjunctive therapy in patients with type 1 diabetes.

### Effects of canagliflozin on initiation of insulin and other antihyperglycaemic agents in the CANVAS program [^114VBpxN]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

3.3 Initiation of insulin in theProgram

The time difference between 10% of patients in the canagliflozin and placebo groups being initiated on insulin from the beginning of the trial was > 2 years, with about 10% of patients in the placebo group on insulin at 52 weeks and 10% of patients in the canagliflozin group on insulin by 160 weeks. During the trials, the risk of initiating insulin was 2.7 times lower for participants treated with canagliflozin compared with placebo (Figure 1).

3.4 Effects on estimated glomerular filtration rate

Proportional hazards held when estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was included in the statistical model (P = 0.103) and the need for initiation of insulin therapy with canagliflozin compared with placebo was lower in both patients with eGFR ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 (HR, 0.37; 95% CI: 0.31, 0.44) and patients with eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 (HR, 0.52; 95% CI: 0.36, 0.75), with no difference in effects between subgroups (P interaction = .11). Those taking insulin at baseline had a lower eGFR than those not on insulin, but the effects of canagliflozin on attenuating the long‐term eGFR decline were qualitatively identical (Figure S2).

### Pharmacodynamic differences between canagliflozin and dapagliflozin: results of a randomized, double-blind, crossover study [^113QneWS]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

The greater reductions in RT G and greater increases in UGE observed in the present study with canagliflozin 300 mg compared with dapagliflozin 10 mg are quantitatively similar to differences that have been observed between canagliflozin doses > 200 mg and canagliflozin 100 mg in previous studies in healthy participants 4. In addition, the reductions in PPG observed with canagliflozin 300 mg have not been observed with canagliflozin doses ≤ 200 mg previously 4, and were not observed with dapagliflozin 10 mg in the present study. Together, these data suggest that the PD effects of canagliflozin 100 mg on RT G, UGE and PPG are quantitatively similar to the effects of dapagliflozin 10 mg. Although no direct comparisons between canagliflozin 100 mg and dapagliflozin 10 mg were made in this study in healthy participants, and no direct comparisons of clinical efficacy between canagliflozin and dapagliflozin in patients with T2DM have been reported, the available data suggest that the PD differences observed between canagliflozin 300 mg and dapagliflozin 10 mg might translate into differences in HbA1c lowering in patients with T2DM that are similar to the differences observed between canagliflozin 300 mg and canagliflozin 100 mg. In phase III studies, canagliflozin 300 mg lowered HbA1c by ∼0.1–0.3% more than canagliflozin 100 mg 12, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27.

### Efficacy and safety of canagliflozin as add-on therapy to a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: a 52-week, open-label, phase IV study [^1128TvGF]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

Sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) are antihyperglycaemic agents with weight-lowering effects. The efficacy and safety of the SGLT2 inhibitor canagliflozin as add-on therapy in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and inadequate glycaemic control with a GLP-1RA (≥ 12 weeks) were evaluated in this phase IV study. Patients received canagliflozin 100 mg once daily for 52 weeks. Efficacy endpoints included change in glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), fasting plasma glucose (FPG), body weight, systolic blood pressure (SBP) and HDL cholesterol from baseline to week 52. Safety endpoints included adverse events (AEs), hypoglycaemia and laboratory tests. Of the 71 patients treated with canagliflozin, 63 completed the study. At 52 weeks, HbA1c was significantly reduced from baseline (-0.70%; paired t test, P < .001). Significant changes were also observed in FPG (-34.7 mg/dL), body weight (-4.46%), SBP (-7.90 mm Hg), and HDL cholesterol (7.60%; all P < .001). The incidence of AEs, adverse drug reactions and hypoglycaemia was 71.8%, 32.4% and 9.9%, respectively. All hypoglycaemic events were mild. These findings suggest that the long-term combination of canagliflozin with a GLP-1RA is effective and well tolerated in Japanese patients with T2DM.

### How and why SGLT2 inhibitors should be explored as potential treatment option in diabetic retinopathy: clinical concept and methodology [^117FLmr8]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Scientific rationale why especially SGLT2 inhibitors might be an effective pharmacologic treatment for prevention and treatment of DR

Conventional antidiabetic therapies, such as sulfonylureas-based therapy regimens, act pharmacologically by enhancing insulin secretion. Efficacy is limited because of progressing β-cell dysfunction and desensitization of insulin signaling resulting in increased peripheral insulin resistance. On the other hand, increased insulin resistance and elevated insulin levels are associated with adverse macrovascular and microvascular consequences. Thus, a more rational approach in these patients may be the reduction of glucotoxicity, insulin resistance, and hyperinsulinemia by adding a SGLT2 inhibitor.

SGLT2 inhibitors are a promising new drug class for the treatment of type 2 diabetes reducing blood glucose levels in type 2 diabetes patients by inhibiting glucose reabsorption in the proximal tubule, subsequently increasing renal glucose excretion. Approved agents for the treatment of type 2 diabetes are empagliflozin (Boehringer Ingelheim, Germany), dapagliflozin (AstraZeneca, UK), and canagliflozin (Johnson & Johnson, US, no longer available in Germany). Pharmacokinetics are very similar for all SGLT2 inhibitors and these drugs have been shown to be safe and well tolerated. With the exception of canagliflozin, which should be given in a higher daily dose when co-administered with CYP450 inducers such as rifampicin, phenytoin, or ritonavir, SGLT2 inhibitors do not show any clinically relevant interactions. Treatment with empagliflozin, dapagliflozin, or canagliflozin reduces cardiovascular mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes at high-risk for cardiovascular events when added to the standard of care. Moreover, diabetic microangiopathy complications such as diabetic nephropathy are significantly improved compared with a placebo when patients are treated with one of the three agents. Whether only these three specific SGLT2 inhibitors are beneficial in patients with diabetes mellitus with regard to microangiopathy is currently unknown but available meta-analyses support the concept of a class effect.

### Long-term safety and efficacy of canagliflozin as add-on therapy to teneligliptin in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes [^115WYs1A]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

This study examined the long‐term safety and efficacy of canagliflozin added on to teneligliptin in Japanese patients with T2DM. In particular, we observed no new safety concerns after administering this combination of drugs compared with previous studies of canagliflozin and teneligliptin. 16, 17, 22 We also observed reductions in HbA1c, FPG and body weight during the study. These effects were apparent within ~4 weeks of starting treatment, and were maintained for 52 weeks without attenuation. The reduction in postprandial glucose levels was also maintained for 52 weeks.

A recent 24‐week randomized, placebo‐controlled trial examined the safety and efficacy of canagliflozin added on to teneligliptin in Japanese patients with T2DM, and showed that this combination was well tolerated and effective. 20 In that study, the addition of canagliflozin was associated with significant improvements in HbA1c, FPG, body weight and postprandial plasma glucose‐related variables. The present study not only confirms the results of this previous study, but also shows that the improvements in HbA1c, FPG, body weight and postprandial glucose were maintained over a longer time period (52 weeks vs 24 weeks). Similarly to the present study, Inagaki et al. 22 also conducted an open‐label, long‐term (52‐week) study of the safety and efficacy of canagliflozin (100 or 200 mg) as monotherapy or added on to other oral antihyperglycaemic drugs, including DPP‐4 inhibitors (sitagliptin, vildagliptin or alogliptin) in Japan. Other 52‐week studies in Japanese patients examined the safety and efficacy of the SGLT2 inhibitors empagliflozin and dapagliflozin added on to other oral antihyperglycaemic drugs, including DPP‐4 inhibitors. Although some data (eg, postprandial glucose) were not reported, the authors mentioned that an SGLT2 inhibitor in combination with a DPP‐4 inhibitor achieved clinically relevant reductions in HbA1c, and was generally well tolerated. 23, 24 The safety and efficacy of combinations of SGLT2 inhibitors and DPP‐4 inhibitors have also been investigated in Western patients. For example, a sub‐analysis of the CANVAS trial revealed improvements in HbA1c and body weight when canagliflozin was added on to a DPP‐4 inhibitor or GLP‐1 receptor agonist for 18 weeks. 25 Some longer‐term Western studies have also been conducted in which dapagliflozin was added on to sitagliptin (with or without metformin) for 48 weeks, 26 or saxagliptin was added on to dapagliflozin plus metformin for 52 weeks. 27 The results of those studies in Western patients, together with the results of the present study in Japanese patients, indicate that the combination of an SGLT2 inhibitor with a DPP‐4 inhibitor is likely to be effective in terms of improving and maintaining glycaemic control for the long term in patients with T2DM, and ethnic differences are unlikely to confound the effects of this combination.

RESULTS

Subject disposition and baseline characteristics

The intent-to-treat analysis set included 451 subjects randomized at 85 study sites in 12 countries. Demographic and baseline characteristics were balanced across treatment groups (Table 1). Mean age was 52.9 years, and 52% of the subjects were male. Mean BMI was 31.5 kg/m 2, and 56% of the subjects were classified as obese (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m 2). Baseline glycemic control reflected mild to moderate hyperglycemia, with baseline A1C in the 7.6–8.0% range across treatment groups. A total of 49 (11%) subjects discontinued before study completion, with a similar proportion discontinuing across treatment groups.

### Characteristics and outcomes of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus treated with canagliflozin: a real-world analysis [^115T3oNF]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2015). Low credibility.

In the 2015 update to the position statement of the ADA regarding the management of T2DM, the use of agents that inhibit SGLT2 has been included as an option for dual therapy (in combination with metformin) or triple therapy (in combination with metformin plus a sulfonylurea, thiazolidinedione, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor [DPP-4i], or insulin). The Comprehensive Diabetes Management Algorithm issued jointly by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) and American College of Endocrinology (ACE) recommends the use of an SGLT2 inhibitor as a component of dual or triple therapy in combination with metformin or other AHAs as well as a monotherapy.

Canagliflozin, which was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in March 2013, was the first SGLT2 inhibitor to enter the US market. The safety and efficacy of canagliflozin has been established in randomized controlled trials. However, an important test of the effectiveness of any new drug is how it performs in the real world, beyond the confines of randomized controlled trials, which require strict inclusion and exclusion criteria. In a previously published retrospective cohort study, short-term data were reported for the first 3 months after the first canagliflozin claim. The current study aims to extend the scope of this analysis by evaluating outcomes with a longer follow-up period. As in the original study, the primary objective of the current analysis was to evaluate changes in glycemic control (i.e. the attainment of % A1C goals with canagliflozin). Secondary objectives included assessing characteristics of patients using canagliflozin and changes in the treatment patterns among patients with T2DM following the first prescription claim for canagliflozin.

### Dose-ranging effects of canagliflozin, a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor, as add-on to metformin in subjects with type 2 diabetes [^111iqoZm]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

OBJECTIVE

To evaluate the effects of canagliflozin, a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor, in type 2 diabetes mellitus inadequately controlled with metformin monotherapy.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS

This was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter, dose-ranging study in 451 subjects randomized to canagliflozin 50, 100, 200, or 300 mg once daily (QD) or 300 mg twice daily (BID), sitagliptin 100 mg QD, or placebo. Primary end point was change in A1C from baseline through week 12. Secondary end points included change in fasting plasma glucose (FPG), body weight, and overnight urinary glucose-to-creatinine ratio. Safety and tolerability were also assessed.

RESULTS

Canagliflozin was associated with significant reductions in A1C from baseline (7.6–8.0%) to week 12: −0.79, −0.76, −0.70, −0.92, and −0.95% for canagliflozin 50, 100, 200, 300 mg QD and 300 mg BID, respectively, versus −0.22% for placebo (all P < 0.001) and −0.74% for sitagliptin. FPG was reduced by −16 to −27 mg/dL, and body weight was reduced by −2.3 to −3.4%, with significant increases in urinary glucose-to-creatinine ratio. Adverse events were transient, mild to moderate, and balanced across arms except for a non–dose-dependent increase in symptomatic genital infections with canagliflozin (3–8%) versus placebo and sitagliptin (2%). Urinary tract infections were reported without dose dependency in 3–9% of canagliflozin, 6% of placebo, and 2% of sitagliptin arms. Overall incidence of hypoglycemia was low.

CONCLUSIONS

Canagliflozin added onto metformin significantly improved glycemic control in type 2 diabetes and was associated with low incidence of hypoglycemia and significant weight loss. The safety/tolerability profile of canagliflozin was favorable except for increased frequency of genital infections in females.

### Short commentary on empagliflozin and its potential clinical impact [^116Kv8EB]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

Sodium glucose cotransporter type 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are a new class of drug developed to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). They target the kidney by reducing renal glucose reabsorption and promoting urinary glucose excretion, which reduces hyperglycemia in individuals with T2DM. The SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin has gained approval in the EU and in the United States for the treatment of adults with T2DM (there is no current indication in type 1 diabetes). Empagliflozin has shown a good efficacy and safety profile from clinical trials when given as monotherapy, and as an add-on therapy to other glucose-lowering agents. This short commentary reviews the key efficacy and safety data from empagliflozin phase III trials and examines the potential role this agent may have in the management of T2DM.

### Improved glucose control with weight loss, lower insulin doses, and no increased hypoglycemia with empagliflozin added to titrated multiple daily injections of insulin in obese inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes [^111zazhE]. Diabetes Care (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

We investigated the efficacy and safety of the sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor, empagliflozin, added to multiple daily injections of insulin (MDI insulin) in obese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

Research Design and Methods

Patients inadequately controlled on MDI insulin ± metformin (mean HbA1c 8.3% [67 mmol/mol]; BMI 34.8 kg/m(2); insulin dose 92 international units/day) were randomized and treated with once-daily empagliflozin 10 mg (n = 186), empagliflozin 25 mg (n = 189), or placebo (n = 188) for 52 weeks. Insulin dose was to remain stable in weeks 1–18, adjusted to meet glucose targets in weeks 19–40, then stable in weeks 41–52. The primary end point was change from baseline in HbA1c at week 18. Secondary end points were changes from baseline in insulin dose, weight, and HbA1c at week 52.

Results

Adjusted mean ± SE changes from baseline in HbA1c were -0.50 ± 0.05% (-5.5 ± 0.5 mmol/mol) for placebo versus -0.94 ± 0.05% (-10.3 ± 0.5 mmol/mol) and -1.02 ± 0.05% (-11.1 ± 0.5 mmol/mol) for empagliflozin 10 mg and empagliflozin 25 mg, respectively, at week 18 (both P < 0.001). At week 52, further reductions with insulin titration resulted in changes from baseline in HbA1c of -0.81 ± 0.08% (-8.9 ± 0.9 mmol/mol), -1.18 ± 0.08% (-12.9 ± 0.9 mmol/mol), and -1.27 ± 0.08% (-13.9 ± 0.9 mmol/mol) with placebo, empagliflozin 10 mg, and empagliflozin 25 mg, respectively, and final HbA1c of 7.5% (58 mmol/mol), 7.2% (55 mmol/mol), and 7.1% (54 mmol/mol), respectively. More patients attained HbA1c < 7% (< 53 mmol/mol) with empagliflozin (31–42%) versus placebo (21%; both P < 0.01). Empagliflozin 10 mg and empagliflozin 25 mg reduced insulin doses (-9 to -11 international units/day) and weight (-2.4 to -2.5 kg) versus placebo (all P < 0.01) at week 52.

Conclusions

In obese, difficult-to-treat patients with T2DM inadequately controlled on high MDI insulin doses, empagliflozin improved glycemic control and reduced weight without increasing the risk of hypoglycemia and with lower insulin requirements.

### Effective utilization of oral hypoglycemic agents to achieve individualized HbA1c targets in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^112RGtHc]. Diabetes Therapy (2016). Low credibility.

SGLT2 Inhibitors

These are the newest group of oral hypoglycemic agents, and include dapagliflozin, canagliflozin, and empagliflozin. SGLT2 is a protein which encourages glucose reabsorption in the proximal tubule in the kidney. The SGLT2 inhibitors block the receptor site, preventing activation of the glucose channel and glucose reabsorption, so the glucose remains in the renal filtrate and ultimately the urine. As the filtrate passes through the loop of Henle, water is reabsorbed by osmosis, but as a result of the elevated levels of glucose in the filtrate, reduced water reabsorption occurs, resulting in increased urine production. The loss of glucose in the urine and thus calories can result in weight loss. However, the side effects due to the glycosuria include increased risk of urinary tract infections and thrush/balanitis. For SGLT2 inhibitors to be effective, good renal function is required, and they should not be prescribed to patients whose eGFR is less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2. The increased diuresis that can result from glycosuria can potentially cause hypotension, and SGLT2 inhibitors should be used with caution in combination with a loop diuretic. The three SGLT2 inhibitors vary in their licensing guidance. Dapagliflozin is not licensed with pioglitazone, is not recommended in triple therapy, and should be stopped if eGFR drops below 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2. Canagliflozin and empagliflozin are both licensed for triple therapy and with pioglitazone. They can be continued at the lower prescribable dose even if eGFR drops below 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 if a therapeutic benefit has been noted, but are stopped if eGFR drops below 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2. SGLT2 inhibitors are taken once daily, with canagliflozin and empagliflozin having the option of a titrating dose. If the HbA1c has not reduced by 6 mmol/mol following the initiation of treatment, it should be discontinued. Unless prescribed in combination with a sulfonylurea or insulin, then the risk of hypoglycemia is low.

### Efficacy of additional canagliflozin administration to type 2 diabetes patients receiving insulin therapy: examination of diurnal glycemic patterns using continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) [^116bPGjH]. Diabetes Therapy (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

The efficacy of administering a sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor during insulin therapy has not been established. In this study, we examined its effects based on diurnal glycemic patterns using continuous glucose monitoring (CGM).

Methods

The subjects were 15 patients who had received insulin therapy for 1 year or more. A CGM device was attached to all subjects for 1 week. The administration of canagliflozin at 100 mg was started 4 days after attachment. The mean glucose concentrations, standard deviation (SD), mean amplitude of glycemic excursions (MAGE), mean of daily difference of blood glucose (MODD), and area under the curve (AUC) (≥ 180, < 70 mg h/dL) after the start of administration were compared with the pretreatment values. In addition, we compared changes in the number of insulin units between basal and bolus insulin. Furthermore, we investigated the influence of canagliflozin on oxidative stress markers and cytokines using 8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and adiponectin as parameters.

Results

The mean glucose concentrations decreased from 161.1 to 139.1 mg/dL (P < 0.01). The SD decreased from 36.5 to 29.6 mg/dL (P = 0.05). The MAGE decreased from 89.2 to 77.4 mg/dL (P < 0.01), and the MODD decreased from 34.3 to 25.5 mg/dL (P < 0.05). All parameters showed significant improvements in diurnal changes. AUC of ≥ 180, i.e. the total area of blood glucose levels at or above 180 on the blood glucose curve of CGM, decreased from 339.1 to 113.6 mg/dL (P < 0.05). AUC of < 70, i.e. the total area of blood glucose levels below 70 on the blood glucose curve of CGM, slightly decreased from 1.6 to 0.3 mg/dL (P = 0.08). The total number of basal insulin units decreased from 128 to 76, and that of bolus insulin decreased from 266 to 154; the dose of insulin could be markedly decreased. In addition, the mean 8-OHdG level decreased from 11.4 to 10.8 ng/mg Cre (P < 0.05), and the mean TNF-α level decreased from 2.31 to 1.79 pg/mL (P = 0.10). The mean adiponectin level increased from 5.01 to 5.53 μg/mL (P < 0.05).

Conclusion

Canagliflozin improved blood glucose changes in type 2 diabetes using insulin. In addition, the results suggest its antioxidant actions.

### Long-term safety and efficacy of canagliflozin as add-on therapy to teneligliptin in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes [^114P8rLh]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

Aim

To evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of canagliflozin as add-on therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) who had inadequate glycaemic control with teneligliptin monotherapy.

Methods

This open-label 52-week study was conducted in Japan. Patients received canagliflozin 100mg added to teneligliptin 20mg orally once daily for 52weeks. The safety endpoint was the incidence of adverse events (AEs). The efficacy endpoints included changes in glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and body weight from baseline to week 52 (with last observation carried forward).

Results

Overall, 153 patients entered the treatment period and 142 completed the study. The overall incidence rates of AEs and drug-related AEs were 69.9% and 22.9%, respectively. Most AEs and drug-related AEs were mild or moderate in severity. There were no previously undescribed safety signals. The mean changes in HbA1c, FPG and body weight were -0.99% (95% confidence interval [CI] -1.12 to -0.85), -38.6mg/dL (95% CI -43.4 to -33.9) and -3.92% (95% CI -4.53 to -3.31), respectively. These effects were maintained for 52weeks without attenuation. HbA1c and body weight were both decreased in 82.24% of patients at the end of the treatment period. Reductions in postprandial glucose were observed at weeks 24 and 52.

Conclusions

No new safety risks with this combination were identified, and sustained improvements in HbA1c, FPG and body weight were observed. The findings suggest that long-term co-administration of canagliflozin with teneligliptin is well tolerated and effective in Japanese patients with T2DM who have inadequate glycaemic control on teneligliptin alone.

### Efficacy and safety of dual add-on therapy with dapagliflozin plus saxagliptin versus glimepiride in patients with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes on a stable dose of metformin: results from a 52-week, randomized, active-controlled trial [^116ypAFa]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Cardiovascular outcomes were not evaluated in this study. However, the Empagliflozin Cardiovascular Outcome Event Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients – Removing Excess Glucose (EMPA REG OUTCOME), Canagliflozin Cardiovascular Assessment Study (CANVAS) and DAPA Effect on Cardiovascular Events (DECLARE‐TIMI 58) trials have shown beneficial cardiovascular effects with the SGLT‐2 inhibitors empagliflozin, canagliflozin and DAPA, respectively. 27, 28, 29 Furthermore, preliminary findings from the CARdiovascular Outcome study of LINAgliptin versus GLIM in patients with type 2 diabetes (CAROLINA) showed similar cardiovascular safety profiles between a DPP‐4 inhibitor (linagliptin) and GLIM, with a lower risk for hypoglycaemia and weight gain with the DPP‐4 inhibitor. 30 Thus, the potential cardiovascular benefits of DAPA and the consistently reported reduction in hypoglycaemia risk and weight gain with DPP‐4 inhibitors highlight several advantages of using these agents for treatment intensification over the use of GLIM alone with metformin.

The practical benefits of add‐on therapy with DAPA + SAXA, compared with GLIM, are also worthy of mention. Importantly, this combination regimen does not require the careful dose titration and frequent glucose monitoring associated with sulphonylurea therapy, so may increase adherence to treatment. Nevertheless, a dual‐therapy regimen with sulphonylurea might still be an appropriate treatment choice because of its relatively lower costs compared with other glucose‐lowering agents.

The findings from this study add to the body of evidence for the benefits of early combination therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes who have insufficient glycaemic control on metformin monotherapy. 31 Administration of multiple antidiabetes agents early on in the disease may enable more rapid attainment of glycaemic control than with the traditional stepwise treatment approach and could possibly delay the deterioration of β‐cell function that characterizes type 2 diabetes. 32

### SGLT2 inhibitors as add on therapy in type 2 diabetes: a real world study [^113Do3XH]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

In our clinic, the use of SGLT2 doesn't correspond to a first line treatment. Despite the decrease in HbA1C, few patients achieved ADA glycated hemoglobin goals.

Second-line pharmacotherapy selection for patients with T2DM is debated. Experts recommended patient- specific considerations. SGLT2 are a promising new class of diabetes pharmacotherapy that particularly shows favorable effects on weight, low potential of hypoglycemia and a reduction of cardiovascular risk.

We observed a significant reduction of HbA1C, similar to a trend in the use of SGLT2 inhibitors as combination therapy compared with previous studies, lowering HbA1C by 1%–1.5%. The majority of clinical trials evaluate moderately uncontrolled diabetes and there is limited data available describing the efficacy of these drugs in patients with poor metabolic control; however, the reduction in glucotoxicity with SGLT2 and improvement insulin sensitivity may result in an increase benefit in patients with a higher HbA1C. We noted a steady increase in control rates in patients receiving SGLT2 inhibitors in addition to sulfonylureas and DPP4 inhibitors, but our results are less than those of controlled clinical trials, attributable to not following current guidelines that recommend stepwise intensification. Rosentock et al. reported a better response in HbA1C goals with triple therapy saxagliptin, metformin and dapagliflozin (41%) and the dual addition of saxagliptin and dapagliflozin (22%). They reported a reduction of HbA1C levels of 1.47%. This HbA1C reduction in the dual add-on group was less than the summation of the reductions seen in the monotherapy arms. No significant differences in control between canagliflozin and dapagliflozin were noted, probably due to class effect. In a recent study, empagliflozin has been noted to reduce CVD risk; however, it was not evaluated here due to unavailability. Metformin is recommended as first- line treatment for patients with T2DM due to its well-established efficacy, safety, low cost, and data demonstrating a reduction in risk of cardiovascular events. SGLT2 as monotherapy is an option in patients with contraindications to the use of metformin or who do not tolerate metformin; in our group alone, this was considered in only 21 patients (6.25%).

### The CANVAS program: implications of canagliflozin on reducing cardiovascular risk in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^111Grhnj]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2019). Medium credibility.

Canagliflozin is a sodium glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor that reduces blood glucose, as well as blood pressure, body weight, and albuminuria in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). In the CANagliflozin cardioVascular Assessment Study (CANVAS) Program, patients with T2DM and high cardiovascular risk treated with canagliflozin had a significantly lower risk of the composite outcome of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke; hospitalization for heart failure; and renal outcomes, but also a greater risk of lower-limb amputation. Cardiovascular outcomes trials of some other T2DM agents (i.e., empagliflozin, dapagliflozin, liraglutide, semaglutide, albiglutide) have also shown potential cardiovascular and renal benefits. As a result, diabetes treatment guidelines have begun to incorporate consideration of cardiovascular and renal benefits into their treatment recommendations. Antihyperglycemic agents with proven beneficial cardiovascular effects represent a new opportunity for the diabetologist and cardiologist, in the setting of a multidisciplinary approach, to concomitantly improve glycemic control and reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in patients with T2DM. This review briefly discusses the pharmacology of canagliflozin, including clinical and preclinical data; it also describes the effects of canagliflozin on cardiovascular outcomes and side-effects, and compares these effects with other glucose-lowering agents with proven cardiovascular benefits.

Type 2 diabetes — prandial insulin initiation, intensification options, and NPH conversion: For initiation and titration of prandial insulin, add 4 units a day or 10% of basal insulin dose; if A1C < 8% (64 mmol/mol), consider reducing the basal insulin dose by 4 units or 10%; increase by 1–2 units or 10–15% twice weekly; and for hypoglycemia lower corresponding dose by 10–20%. If bedtime NPH, consider converting to twice-daily NPH regimen with initial dose 80% of current bedtime NPH dose, 2/3 given in the morning and 1/3 given at bedtime. Stepwise doses of prandial insulin (e.g., two, then three additional injections) are described, with the option to proceed to full basal-bolus plan.

### Efficacy and safety of sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors in type 2 diabetes mellitus: systematic review and network meta-analysis [^113sR1GQ]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

Aim

To assess the comparative efficacy and safety of sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors in adults with type 2 diabetes.

Methods

We electronically searched randomized controlled trials (≥ 24 weeks) including canagliflozin, dapagliflozin or empagliflozin that were published up to 3 November 2015. Data were collected on cardiometabolic and safety outcomes and synthesized using network meta-analyses.

Results

A total of 38 trials (23 997 participants) were included. Compared with placebo, all SGLT2 inhibitors reduced glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), fasting plasma glucose (FPG), body weight and blood pressure, and slightly increased HDL cholesterol. Canagliflozin 300 mg reduced HbA1c, FPG and systolic blood pressure and increased LDL cholesterol to a greater extent compared with other inhibitors at any dose. At their highest doses, canagliflozin 300 mg reduced: HbA1c by 0.2% [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.1–0.3] versus both dapagliflozin 10 mg and empagliflozin 25 mg; FPG by 0.6 mmol/l (95% CI 0.3–0.9) and 0.5 mmol/l (95% CI 0.1–0.8) versus dapagliflozin and empagliflozin, respectively; and systolic blood pressure by 2 mmHg (95% CI 1.0–3.0) versus dapagliflozin; and increased LDL cholesterol by 0.13 mmol/l (95% CI 0.03–0.23) and 0.15 mmol/l (95% CI 0.06–0.23) versus dapagliflozin and empagliflozin, respectively. The highest doses of inhibitors had similar effects on body weight reduction. Canagliflozin 300 and 100 mg increased the risk of hypoglycaemia versus placebo, dapagliflozin 10 mg and empagliflozin 10 mg [odds ratios (ORs) 1.4–1.6]. Dapagliflozin 10 mg increased the risk of urinary tract infection versus placebo and empagliflozin 25 mg (ORs 1.4). All inhibitors similarly increased the risk of genital infection (ORs 4–6 versus placebo).

Conclusions

Although they increase the risk of genital infection, SGLT2 inhibitors are effective in improving cardiometabolic markers in type 2 diabetes, with canagliflozin 300 mg performing better in this respect than other inhibitors. Further studies will clarify whether these differences are likely to translate into differing long-term outcomes.

### Dose-ranging effects of canagliflozin, a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor, as add-on to metformin in subjects with type 2 diabetes [^111UvEcL]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the effects of canagliflozin, a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor, in type 2 diabetes mellitus inadequately controlled with metformin monotherapy.

Research Design and Methods

This was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter, dose-ranging study in 451 subjects randomized to canagliflozin 50, 100, 200, or 300 mg once daily (QD) or 300 mg twice daily (BID), sitagliptin 100 mg QD, or placebo. Primary end point was change in A1C from baseline through week 12. Secondary end points included change in fasting plasma glucose (FPG), body weight, and overnight urinary glucose-to-creatinine ratio. Safety and tolerability were also assessed.

Results

Canagliflozin was associated with significant reductions in A1C from baseline (7.6–8.0%) to week 12: -0.79, -0.76, -0.70, -0.92, and -0.95% for canagliflozin 50, 100, 200, 300 mg QD and 300 mg BID, respectively, versus -0.22% for placebo (all P < 0.001) and -0.74% for sitagliptin. FPG was reduced by -16 to -27 mg/dL, and body weight was reduced by -2.3 to -3.4%, with significant increases in urinary glucose-to-creatinine ratio. Adverse events were transient, mild to moderate, and balanced across arms except for a non-dose-dependent increase in symptomatic genital infections with canagliflozin (3–8%) versus placebo and sitagliptin (2%). Urinary tract infections were reported without dose dependency in 3–9% of canagliflozin, 6% of placebo, and 2% of sitagliptin arms. Overall incidence of hypoglycemia was low.

Conclusions

Canagliflozin added onto metformin significantly improved glycemic control in type 2 diabetes and was associated with low incidence of hypoglycemia and significant weight loss. The safety/tolerability profile of canagliflozin was favorable except for increased frequency of genital infections in females.

### Canagliflozin and metformin hydrochloride (Invokamet) [^113uUTqk]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Canagliflozin

The data in Table 3 are derived from four 26-week placebo-controlled trials where canagliflozin was used as monotherapy in one trial and as add-on therapy in three trials. These data reflect exposure of 1,667 adult patients to canagliflozin and a mean duration of exposure to canagliflozin of 24 weeks with 1,275 patients exposed to a combination of canagliflozin and metformin HCl. Patients received canagliflozin 100 mg (N = 833), canagliflozin 300 mg (N = 834) or placebo (N = 646) once daily. The mean daily dose of metformin HCl was 2,138 mg (SD 337.3) for the 1,275 patients in the three placebo-controlled metformin HCl add-on trials. The mean age of the population was 56 years and 2% were older than 75 years of age. Fifty percent (50%) of the population was male and 72% were White, 12% were Asian, and 5% were Black or African American. At baseline the population had diabetes for an average of 7.3 years, had a mean HbA1Cof 8.0% and 20% had established microvascular complications of diabetes. Baseline renal function was normal or mildly impaired (mean eGFR 88 mL/min/1.73 m2).

Table 3 shows common adverse reactions associated with the use of canagliflozin. These adverse reactions were not present at baseline, occurred more commonly on canagliflozin than on placebo, and occurred in at least 2% of patients treated with either canagliflozin 100 mg or canagliflozin 300 mg.

Abdominal pain was also more commonly reported in patients taking canagliflozin 100 mg (1.8%), 300 mg (1.7%) than in patients taking placebo (0.8%).

Canagliflozin and Metformin HCl

The incidence and type of adverse reactions in the three 26-week placebo-controlled metformin HCl tablets add-on trials in adults, representing a majority of data from the four 26-week placebo-controlled trials, was similar to the adverse reactions described in Table 3. There were no additional adverse reactions identified in the pooling of these three placebo-controlled trials that included metformin HCl tablets relative to the four placebo-controlled trials.

In a trial in adults with canagliflozin as initial combination therapy with metformin HCl [see Clinical Studies (14.1)], an increased incidence of diarrhea was observed in the canagliflozin and metformin HCl combination groups (4.2%) compared to canagliflozin or metformin HCl monotherapy groups (1.7%).

Canagliflozin — CANVAS and CANVAS-R cardiovascular outcomes — enrolled 4,330 and 5,812 patients, respectively, with 72% having established ASCVD, and randomized participants to placebo or canagliflozin (100 or 300 mg in CANVAS, and 100 mg with an optional increase to 300 mg in CANVAS-R). The combined analysis demonstrated a 14% relative reduction in triple MACE versus placebo (HR: 0.86; 95% CI: 0.75 to 0.97 from 31.5 to 26.9 events per 1,000 person-years). Although none of the individual components were statistically significant on their own, point estimates favored SGLT2 therapy — CV death (HR: 0.87; 95% CI: 0.72 to 1.06), fatal or nonfatal MI (HR: 0.89; 95% CI: 0.73 to 1.09), and fatal or nonfatal stroke (HR: 0.87; 95% CI: 0.69 to 1.09) — and all-cause mortality showed HR: 0.87; 95% CI: 0.74 to 1.01.

### Efficacy and safety of empagliflozin added to existing antidiabetes treatment in patients with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^115gRbL1]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2014). Medium credibility.

Background

Diabetes is a leading cause of chronic kidney disease (CKD) worldwide. Optimum glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes is important to minimise the risk of microvascular and macrovascular complications and to slow the progression of CKD. We assessed the efficacy and safety of empagliflozin as an add-on treatment in patients with type 2 diabetes and CKD.

Methods

We did a phase 3, randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled trial at 127 centres in 15 countries. Patients with HbA1c of 7% or greater to 10% or less were eligible for inclusion. Patients with stage 2 CKD (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] ≥ 60 to < 90 mL/min per 1·73 m(2); n = 290) were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to receive empagliflozin 10 mg or 25 mg or placebo once daily for 52 weeks. Patients with stage 3 CKD (eGFR ≥ 30 to < 60 mL/min per 1·73 m(2); n = 374) were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive empagliflozin 25 mg or placebo for 52 weeks. Randomisation was done with a computer-generated random sequence and stratified by renal impairment, HbA1c, and background antidiabetes medication. Treatment assignment was masked from patients and investigators. The primary endpoint was change from baseline in HbA1c at week 24 by ANCOVA in the full analysis set. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01164501.

Findings

In patients with stage 2 CKD, adjusted mean treatment differences versus placebo in changes from baseline in HbA1c at week 24 were -0·52% (95% CI -0·72 to -0·32) for empagliflozin 10 mg and -0·68% (-0·88 to -0·49) for empagliflozin 25 mg (both p < 0·0001). In patients with stage 3 CKD, adjusted mean treatment difference versus placebo in change from baseline in HbA1c at week 24 was -0·42% (-0·56 to -0·28) for empagliflozin 25 mg (p < 0·0001). In patients with stage 2 CKD, adverse events were reported over 52 weeks by 83 patients (87%) on placebo (15 severe [16%] and 11 serious [12%]), 86 (88%) on empagliflozin 10 mg (six severe [6%] and six serious [6%]) and 78 (80%) on empagliflozin 25 mg (eight severe [8%] and seven serious [7%]). In patients with stage 3 CKD, adverse events were reported over 52 weeks by 156 patients (83%) on placebo (15 severe [8%] and 23 serious [12%]) and 156 (83%) on empagliflozin 25 mg (18 severe [10%] and 22 serious [12%]).

Interpretation

In patients with type 2 diabetes and stage 2 or 3 CKD, empagliflozin reduced HbA1c and was well tolerated. However, our findings might not be applicable to the general population of patients with type 2 diabetes and renal impairment.

### Efficacy and safety of canagliflozin as add-on therapy to teneligliptin in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: results of a 24-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^115354Et]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2017). Low credibility.

Previous clinical trials investigating the use of SGLT2 inhibitors as add‐on therapy to DPP‐4 inhibitors in Japanese patients with T2DM and inadequate glycaemic control have been limited to open‐label studies, for example, that by Inagaki et al. 14 To date, there have been no randomized, controlled trials examining the efficacy of an SGLT2 inhibitor added on to a DPP‐4 inhibitor in Asian patients. Therefore, to evaluate the efficacy and safety of SGLT2 inhibitors as add‐on therapy to DPP‐4 inhibitors, we conducted a randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled clinical trial in which Japanese patients with T2DM and inadequate glycaemic control with teneligliptin monotherapy along with diet and exercise were randomized to either the SGLT2 inhibitor canagliflozin or placebo once daily as an add‐on to teneligliptin.

### Cardiovascular protection with sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors in type 2 diabetes: does it apply to all patients? [^113bnBJV]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

CV death was reduced to a greater extent with empagliflozin than with canagliflozin (38% vs. 13%, respectively; no significant difference was observed between subgroups based on history of heart failure [HF]). 11, 32, 44 The all‐cause mortality rates, per 1000 patient‐years, were 19.4 with empagliflozin in EMPA‐REG OUTCOME and 17.3 with canagliflozin in CANVAS. This may be because of the differences in the baseline characteristics of the enrolled patients, which would suggest that the benefit of SGLT2 inhibitors may be larger in patients with a previous CV event or current CVD compared with those with MRF without CVD. Alternatively, as the disparities between enrolled patient populations were limited, the possibility that specific SGLT2 inhibitors may differentially impact on CV death cannot be dismissed.

2.1.2 DECLARE‐TIMI 58

DECLARE‐TIMI 58 was a randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled trial in patients with T2D and MRF (n = 10 186, 59.4%) or established ASCVD (n = 6971, 40.6%). DECLARE‐TIMI 58 had two primary endpoints, with the protocol amended to add a composite of CV death and hHF during the study. A statistically significant reduction in CV death and hHF was observed for dapagliflozin (HR: 0.83; 95% CI: 0.73, 0.95; p = 0.005), driven by a lower rate of hHF (HR: 0.73; 95% CI: 0.61, 0.88), as well as a non‐significant numerical reduction in the co‐primary endpoint of 3P‐MACE (HR: 0.93; 95% CI: 0.84, 1.03; p = 0.17). 33 There was no difference detected between the dapagliflozin and placebo groups in the rate of CV death (HR: 0.98; 95% CI: 0.82, 1.17). In the primary safety analysis, dapagliflozin met the prespecified criterion for non‐inferiority with respect to MACE (upper boundary of 95% CI < 1.3; P < .001 for non‐inferiority). 33

Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Pooled data from the CANVAS and CANVAS‐R trials revealed an unexpected ≈2‐fold higher incidence of lower limb amputation associated with canagliflozin (6.3 versus 3.4 participants per 1000 patient‐years), corresponding to a number needed to harm of ≈300. 12, 58 A pharmacovigilance analysis using FAERS confirmed that use of canagliflozin might be associated with an increased risk of amputations. 59 On the basis of these data, the FDA has added a "black box warning" regarding amputations with canagliflozin, 58 although inconsistent findings were found in a much larger retrospective real‐world study involving 63 845 new users each receiving canagliflozin or non–SGLT2 inhibitor agents (196 amputation events). 60 The European Medicines Agency's Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee warns that the risk of amputation may also apply to other SGLT2 inhibitors to highlight the importance of routine preventative foot care because amputation has a large negative impact on patient clinical course, 61 although no data are available to date supporting this generalization. 62 Indeed, in the pharmacovigilance analysis mentioned, increase of amputation risk was not observed in patients receiving dapagliflozin or empagliflozin. 59 Whether the risk is specific to canagliflozin or is a class effect of SGLT2 inhibitors remains to be understood. It is very likely that the EMPA‐REG OUTCOME trial of empagliflozin will be reassessed because primary analysis of this trial did not systematically include adequate data on amputation. 11 The ongoing DECLARE (Dapagliflozin Effect on Cardiovascular Events) trial, a large‐scale cardiovascular outcomes trial of dapagliflozin that is now required to systematically collect amputation data, will shed light on this debate.

Limitations

We acknowledge several limitations. First, the results were analyzed for study‐level data but not for patient‐level data; individual patient‐level data could improve the accuracy of the findings. Second, we could not rule out potential publication bias even though statistical evaluation did not suggest significant publication bias. Third, considerable heterogeneity was detected in the analyses of several outcomes and may be due to the differences in trial populations, baseline comorbidities, and treatment regimens. In these cases, data were pooled with random‐effects models. Fourth, most patients enrolled were white; therefore, caution should be used in generalizing the findings to other populations.

### Dose-ranging effects of canagliflozin, a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor, as add-on to metformin in subjects with type 2 diabetes [^113rZVBZ]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

FPG.

Significantly greater mean reductions in FPG were observed with all doses of canagliflozin (−16.2 to −27.0 mg/dL) compared with placebo (3.6 mg/dL). Sitagliptin also reduced FPG (−12.6 mg/dL) (Fig. 1 B). The FPG reduction with canagliflozin appeared maximal at doses of 200 mg QD and above. Reduction in FPG was maximal by the first double-blind treatment period visit at week 3 and was maintained through week 12.

Body weight.

Body weight reductions were seen in all canagliflozin groups relative to placebo (Fig. 1 C). Canagliflozin was associated with reductions in body weight from baseline; these reductions were −2.3 to −3.4% (−2.0 to −2.9 kg) at week 12. Reductions observed in the placebo and sitagliptin treatment groups were −1.1% (−0.8 kg) and −0.6% (−0.4 kg) from baseline, respectively. Weight loss appeared to be greatest in subjects in the canagliflozin 300-mg QD and BID groups. Weight loss was progressive during the 12-week treatment period without apparently reaching a plateau. At week 12, last observation carried forward, at least a 5% body weight loss from baseline was observed in 16, 12, 22, 21, and 32% of subjects in the canagliflozin 50-, 100-, 200-, and 300-mg QD and the 300-mg BID dose groups, respectively, compared with 5% in the placebo group and 6% in the sitagliptin group.

UGE.

All doses of canagliflozin increased the overnight U Glucose -to-U Creatinine ratio (Fig. 1 D). The increase in U Glucose -to-U Creatinine ratio was similar with 100- to 300-mg QD doses and modestly greater than observed with the 50-mg QD dose; an additional increase in UGE with 300 mg BID was also noted. The increase in UGE observed at week 3 persisted without evident attenuation through week 12. Canagliflozin lowered overnight calculated RT G in a dose-dependent fashion. RT G (mean ± SD) was lowered to 80.3 ± 27.1 and 77.1 ± 23.1 mg/dL with 300-mg QD and 300-mg BID treatments, respectively, at week 12.

### Efficacy and safety of canagliflozin in combination with insulin: a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^115KX6gb]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2016). Low credibility.

a Hypoglycemia in the follow-up period was excluded

The mean daily insulin dose during treatment was 29.7 units. Hypoglycemic events occurred similarly in patients receiving lower (< 29.7 units), equal, or higher than (≥ 29.7 units) the average insulin dose. The incidence of hypoglycemia in patients receiving an insulin dose of < 29.7 units or ≥ 29.7 units was 27.5% (n = 11) or 32.3% (n = 10), respectively, in the placebo group and 39.5% (n = 15) or 40.5% (n = 15), respectively, in the canagliflozin group.

The incidence of hypoglycemia and incidence per subject-year exposure did not differ substantially according to the type of insulin regimen received by either the placebo group or the canagliflozin group (Table 5). Additional file 2: Table S1 summarizes the incidence of hypoglycemia at 0:00–5:59, 6:00–11:59, 12:00–17:59, and 18:00–23:59 h. The hypoglycemic events occurred most frequently between 6:00 and 11:59 h. Furthermore, the incidence of hypoglycemia of both groups was not associated with exposure period (data not shown). The incidence of hypoglycemia per subject-year exposure was higher in the canagliflozin group (7.97) than in the placebo group (4.51) (Table 5). For patients whose insulin dose was decreased by the investigator because of a hypoglycemic event, the incidence rate of hypoglycemia per subject-year exposure decreased with dose reduction in the canagliflozin group, regardless of the type of insulin regimen (Table 6).

### Potential place of sglt2 inhibitors in treatment paradigms for type 2 diabetes mellitus [^114APGot]. Endocrine Practice (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

Following the first Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval in 2013, sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have generated much interest among physicians treating patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Here, the role in treatment with this drug class is considered in the context of T2DM treatment paradigms.

Methods

The clinical trials for the SGLT2 inhibitors are examined with a focus on canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, and empagliflozin.

Results

Evidence from clinical trials in patients with T2DM supports the use of SGLT2 inhibitors either as monotherapy or in addition to other glucose-lowering treatments as adjuncts to diet and exercise, and we have gained significant clinical experience in a relatively short time.

Conclusion

The drugs appear to be useful in a variety of T2DM populations, contingent primarily on renal function. Most obviously, SGLT2 inhibitors appear to be well suited for patients with potential for hypoglycemia or weight gain. In clinical trials, patients treated with SGLT2 inhibitors have experienced moderate weight loss and a low risk of hypoglycemic events except when used in combination with an insulin secretagogue. In addition, SGLT2 inhibitors have been shown to reduce blood pressure, so they may be beneficial in patients with T2DM complicated by hypertension. SGLT2 inhibitors were incorporated into the 2015 American Diabetes Association (ADA)/European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) position statement on the management of hyperglycemia and received an even more prominent position in the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE)/American College of Endocrinology (ACE) comprehensive diabetes management guidelines and algorithm.

### SGLT2 inhibitors through the windows of EMPA-REG and CANVAS trials: a review [^116KQXoA]. Diabetes Therapy (2017). Low credibility.

A profound reduction (38%) in CV death was observed with empagliflozin, compared to only 13% reduction in CV death with canagliflozin on top of optimal secondary preventive measures including aspirin and statin therapy, despite being from the same class. This could be related to the differences in the baseline characteristics of the study population, effect of concurrent use of cardioprotective drugs, selectivity for SGLT2 over SGLT1 transporters (> 2500-fold for empagliflozin and > 250-fold for canagliflozin), adjudication of CV events or statistical analysis of the results. The differences in the baseline characteristics (Table 1) of the study subjects might explain the disparity in observed CV outcomes. Two-thirds of patients in the CANVAS trial had established CV events and one-third were at risk for CV events, whereas EMPA-REG enrolled 99.5% of subjects with prior CV events. It is presumed that the higher the baseline HbA1c is, the greater the HbA1c reduction with any intervention will be. In a similar way, the higher the baseline risk for CV events is, the better the CV protection will be, as was shown in the EMPA-REG trial. Is it so simple to confirm this presumption? Yes, it is probably true, as subjects with prior CV events in the CANVAS trial had 18% reduction in CV death (HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.72–0.95) compared to only 2% in those without prior CV events (HR 0.98, 95% CI 0.74–1.30). Further, the follow-up duration could have influenced the MACE outcome in the study groups, as duration of study was double with CANVAS compared to EMPA-REG (6 vs 3 years).

Table 1

The glycemic equipoise, defined as the difference in HbA1c achieved between the drug and the placebo arm, should not exceed 0.3% at the end of the study, which is a prerequisite for CVOTs to abrogate the effect of reduction in glucotoxicity on CV outcomes. The HbA1c differences in the drug arm versus placebo were 0.28% and 0.58%, in EMPA-REG and CANVAS trials, respectively. Hence, some beneficial effects on CV outcomes with canagliflozin may be attributed to glycemic reduction unlike empagliflozin.

### Efficacy and safety of teneligliptin added to canagliflozin monotherapy in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: a multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group comparative study [^111R2ANx]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors and sodium glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are frequently used in combination for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). We examined the efficacy and safety of teneligliptin (a DPP-4 inhibitor) added to canagliflozin (an SGLT2 inhibitor) monotherapy in Japanese patients with poorly controlled T2DM as part of the development of a fixed-dose combination of teneligliptin and canagliflozin. Japanese patients treated with canagliflozin (100 mg) for ≥ 12 weeks were randomized to receive add-on teneligliptin (20 mg; C + T group) or placebo (C + P group) for 24 weeks. The primary endpoint was change in glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) from baseline to Week 24. The between-group differences in reductions from baseline to Week 24 were significantly greater in the C + T group for HbA1c (-0.94%; P < .001). The incidence of adverse events was similar in both groups (55.8% and 49.4% in the C + T and C + P groups, respectively). No episodes of hypoglycaemia were reported. Teneligliptin added to ongoing canagliflozin monotherapy improved glycaemic control and was well tolerated in Japanese patients with inadequately controlled T2DM.

### Anti-obesity medications and investigational agents: an Obesity Medicine Association (OMA) clinical practice statement (CPS) 2022 [^115WGWJc]. Obesity Pillars (2022). High credibility.

Canagliflozin and related SGLT-2 regimens — weight outcomes are summarized: Canagliflozin is illustrative of an SGLT-2 inhibitor that produces dose-dependent modest weight reduction (1–3%) in patients without diabetes due to glucosuria from impairment of proximal renal tubule glucose reabsorption, and licogliflozin, a dual SGLT-1/SGLT-2 inhibitor, significantly reduces body weight though the magnitude is described as modest. In a randomized, placebo-controlled trial, semaglutide once weekly added to SGLT-2 inhibitor therapy in type 2 diabetes produced greater reductions in HbA1c (−1.42%) and body weight (−3.81 kg) versus placebo. In a randomized, controlled trial of patients with type 2 diabetes on stable metformin monotherapy, exenatide plus dapagliflozin produced clinically relevant changes in body weight, fasting plasma glucose, 2h post-prandial glucose, and systolic blood pressure.

### Ertugliflozin compared to other anti-hyperglycemic agents as monotherapy and add-on therapy in type 2 diabetes: a systematic literature review and network meta-analysis [^112dBUFW]. Diabetes Therapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Ertugliflozin is a new sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. As there are no head-to-head trials comparing the efficacy of SGLT2is, the primary objective of this analysis was to indirectly compare ertugliflozin to other SGLT2i in patient populations with inadequately controlled glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c > 7.0%) and previously treated with either diet/exercise, metformin alone or metformin plus a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor (DPP4i).

Methods

A systematic literature review (SLR) identified randomized controlled trials (RCTs) reporting outcomes at 24–26 weeks of treatment. Comparators to ertugliflozin were the SGLT2is canagliflozin, dapagliflozin and empagliflozin, with non-SGLT2i comparators also evaluated third-line [insulin and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs)]. Outcomes were change from baseline in HbA1c, weight and systolic blood pressure (SBP) as well as HbA1c < 7% and key safety events. Bayesian network meta-analysis was used to synthesize evidence. Results are presented as the median of the mean difference (MD) or as odds ratios with 95% credible intervals (CrI).

Results

In patients uncontrolled on diet/exercise, the efficacy of ertugliflozin 5 mg monotherapy was not significantly different from that of other low-dose SGLT2is in terms of HbA1c reduction, while ertugliflozin 15 mg was more effective than dapagliflozin 10 mg (MD − 0.36%, CrI − 0.65, − 0.08) and empagliflozin 25 mg (MD − 0.31%, CrI − 0.58, − 0.04). As add-on therapy to metformin, ertugliflozin 5 mg was more effective in lowering HbA1c than dapagliflozin 5 mg (MD − 0.22%, CrI − 0.42, − 0.02), and ertugliflozin 15 mg was more effective than dapagliflozin 10 mg (MD − 0.26%, CrI − 0.46, − 0.06) and empagliflozin 25 mg (MD − 0.23%, CrI − 0.44, − 0.03). Among patients uncontrolled on combination therapy metformin plus a DPP4i, no relevant RCTs with insulin were identified from the SLR. One study with a GLP-1 RA was included in a sensitivity analysis due to limited data. There were no differences between ertugliflozin 5 or 15 mg and other SGLT2is, with the exception of dapagliflozin 10 mg, which was significantly less effective when added to sitagliptin and metformin. Overall, there were no other significant differences for remaining efficacy and safety outcomes except for a lower SBP for canagliflozin 300 mg compared to ertugliflozin 15 mg in the diet/exercise population.

Conclusions

Indirect comparisons for HbA1c reduction found that ertugliflozin 5 mg was more effective than dapagliflozin 5 mg when added to metformin monotherapy, whereas ertugliflozin 15 mg was more effective than dapagliflozin 10 mg and empagliflozin 25 mg when added to diet/exercise and to metformin monotherapy. The HbA1c reduction associated with ertugliflozin was no different than that associated with canagliflozin across all populations.

### Cost of glycemic target achievement with sodium glucose Co-transporter 2 inhibitors in patients with type 2 diabetes in the UK [^114jK7NJ]. Diabetes Therapy (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Diabetes-related costs make up a large portion of healthcare expenditures in the UK. Many of these costs are related to treatment of diabetes-related complications. Reducing HbA1c to < 7.0% (53 mmol/mol) reduces the incidence of complications and comorbidities. Metformin plus sulfonylurea is the most common dual oral combination therapy in the UK. The costs of achieving HbA1c < 7.0% in patients inadequately controlled on metformin plus sulfonylurea were analyzed for the sodium glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, and empagliflozin from the perspective of the UK National Health System.

Methods

A Bayesian network meta-analysis (NMA) was used to compare the proportion of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus inadequately controlled on metformin plus sulfonylurea that achieved HbA1c < 7.0% after 26 weeks with canagliflozin 100 and 300 mg, dapagliflozin 10 mg, and empagliflozin 10 and 25 mg; odds ratios (ORs) and pairwise probabilities (P) for canagliflozin versus dapagliflozin and empagliflozin were calculated. The costs associated with achieving HbA1c < 7.0% were estimated on the basis of medication costs and the proportion of patients achieving the HbA1c goal.

Results

NMA results showed that a higher proportion of patients treated with canagliflozin 300 mg achieved HbA1c < 7.0% (41%) compared with those treated with dapagliflozin 10 mg (25%), empagliflozin 10 mg (23%), empagliflozin 25 mg (28%), or canagliflozin 100 mg (27%). The odds of achieving HbA1c < 7.0% were greater with canagliflozin 300 mg than with dapagliflozin 10 mg (OR 2.03 [P = 94%]), empagliflozin 10 mg (OR 2.29 [P = 99%]), or empagliflozin 25 mg (OR 1.71 [P = 93%]). The per patient costs of achieving HbA1c < 7.0% at 26 weeks were £881, £580, £951, £1034, and £849 with canagliflozin 100 and 300 mg, dapagliflozin 10 mg, and empagliflozin 10 and 25 mg.

Conclusions

This analysis suggests that, in the UK, canagliflozin 300 mg provides the best value for money among all SGLT2 inhibitors in terms of achieving HbA1c < 7.0% when used as part of triple therapy with metformin plus sulfonylurea.

### Canagliflozin… [^113GYKVu]. Wikipedia (2009). Low credibility.

Common side effects include vaginal yeast infections, nausea, constipation, and urinary tract infections. Serious side effects may include low blood sugar, Fournier's gangrene, leg amputation, kidney problems, high blood potassium, and low blood pressure. Diabetic ketoacidosis may occur despite nearly normal blood sugar levels. Use in pregnancy and breastfeeding is not recommended. Canagliflozin is a sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor. It works by increasing the amount of glucose lost in the urine.

Medical uses Canagliflozin is indicated to be used with diet and exercise to lower blood sugar in adults with type 2 diabetes; to reduce the risk of major heart-related events such as heart attack, stroke, or death in people with type 2 diabetes who have known heart disease; and to reduce the risk of end-stage kidney disease, worsening of kidney function, heart-related death, and being hospitalized for heart failure in certain people with type 2 diabetes and diabetic kidney disease. Canagliflozin is an anti-diabetic medication used to improve blood sugar control in people with type 2 diabetes. It is a third-line medication to metformin. Per the British National Formulary it is also less preferred than a sulfonylurea as of 2019, while the American Diabetes Association and European Association for the Study of Diabetes consider either a SGLT2 inhibitor or GLP-1 receptor agonist a reasonable second line medication in those with heart disease. Canagliflozin decreases HbA~1c~ levels by 0.

77% to

1. 16% when given by itself, in combination with metformin, in combination with metformin and a sulfonylurea, in combination with metformin and pioglitazone, or in combination with insulin, from initial HbA~1c~ levels of 7. 8% to
8. 1%. When added to metformin, canagliflozin does not appear worse than sitagliptin or glimepiride in reducing HbA~1c~ levels, while canagliflozin maybe better than sitagliptin and glimiperide in decreasing HbA~1c~. It is unclear whether or not it has any unique cardiovascular benefits beyond lowering blood sugar. Although canagliflozin produces beneficial effects on HDL cholesterol, it has also been shown to increase LDL cholesterol to produce no change in total cholesterol. Evidence shows that apart from positive effects on glycemic levels, canagliflozin also reduces the risk of heart attacks and heart failures.

SGLT2 inhibitors, including canagliflozin, reduce the likelihood of hospitalization for congestive heart failure or progression of renal disease in persons with diabetes mellitus type 2 and reduce the likelihood of stroke and heart attack in persons with diabetes mellitus type 2 who have known atherosclerotic vascular disease. Contraindications Canaglifozin is contraindicated in:

- Type 1 diabetes
- Diabetic ketoacidosis
- Severe renal impairment, end-stage renal disease
- Patients on dialysis. Adverse effects As with other SGLT2 inhibitors, canagliflozin is associated with increased incidence of urinary tract infections, fungal infections of the genital area, thirst, elevations in LDL cholesterol, increased urination and episodes of low blood pressure. Rarely, use of canagliflozin is associated with necrotizing fasciitis of the perineum, also called Fournier gangrene.
