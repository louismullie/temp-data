## Question

21. The ratio of areas of polygons. The perimeters of a certain equilateral triangle and a regular hexagon coincide. What is the ratio of their areas?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for the ratio of the area of an equilateral triangle to the area of a regular hexagon when their perimeters are equal. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about setting up variables for side lengths and expressing the perimeters. Then, I should equate the perimeters to relate the side lengths. Next, I will write the area formulas for both shapes. After that, I will substitute the side-length relationship into the area formulas and compute the ratio. Finally, I should simplify and double-check the result, making sure the units and logic are consistent throughout.

> Let me first confirm the setup. For the equilateral triangle, let the side length be a, so the perimeter is 3a. For the regular hexagon, let the side length be b, so the perimeter is 6b. Since the perimeters coincide, I should set 3a equal to 6b, which immediately gives a = 2b. Wait, let me verify that algebra: 3a = 6b implies a = 2b, yes, that's correct.

> Next, I should review the area formulas. The area of an equilateral triangle with side a is (√3/4)a², and the area of a regular hexagon with side b is (3√3/2)b². Hold on, I should verify the hexagon formula; a regular hexagon can be divided into six equilateral triangles, each of area (√3/4)b², so six of those give 6 × (√3/4)b² = (3√3/2)b², which checks out.

> Now I will substitute the side-length relationship into the area expressions. For the triangle, replacing a with 2b gives area_triangle = (√3/4)(2b)² = (√3/4)(4b²) = √3 b². For the hexagon, the area remains (3√3/2)b². I should double-check the triangle substitution: (√3/4) × 4b² is indeed √3 b², so that's correct.

> I will now compute the ratio of the triangle's area to the hexagon's area. Dividing the triangle's area by the hexagon's area gives (√3 b²) / [(3√3/2)b²]. The √3 and b² terms cancel, leaving 1 / (3/2) = 2/3. Wait, let me verify the cancellation and the final division: yes, 1 divided by 3/2 is 2/3, so the ratio is 2/3.

> Final answer: The ratio of the area of the equilateral triangle to the area of the regular hexagon, when their perimeters are equal, is 2/3.

The ratio of the area of an equilateral triangle to that of a regular hexagon with the same perimeter is **2:3**. This is derived by equating their perimeters to express the triangle's side length in terms of the hexagon's, then substituting into their area formulas. The triangle's area is (\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} a^2) and the hexagon's is (\\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{2} b^2); with (a = 2b), the ratio simplifies to **2:3**.

---

## Step-by-step solution

### Step 1: define variables and perimeter relationship

Let the side length of the equilateral triangle be (a) and the side length of the regular hexagon be (b). The perimeters are equal, so:

[
3a = 6b \\implies a = 2b
]

---

### Step 2: area formulas

The area of an equilateral triangle with side (a) is:

[
A_{\\text{triangle}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} a^2
]

The area of a regular hexagon with side (b) is:

[
A_{\\text{hexagon}} = \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{2} b^2
]

---

### Step 3: substitute and simplify

Substitute (a = 2b) into the triangle's area:

[
A_{\\text{triangle}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} (2b)^2 = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} \\cdot 4b^2 = \\sqrt{3} b^2
]

Now compute the ratio:

[
\\frac{A_{\\text{triangle}}}{A_{\\text{hexagon}}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3} b^2}{\\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{2} b^2} = \\frac{2}{3}
]

---

### Final answer

The ratio of the area of the equilateral triangle to the area of the regular hexagon is **2:3**.

### Plasma membrane remodeling determines adipocyte expansion and mechanical adaptability [^a60bafb5]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Quantification of caveolar contribution to adipocyte volumetric oscillations

Caveolar flattening provides additional membrane surfaceand could thereby enable adipocyte expansion by readily increasing cellular volume. To estimate this effect, we considered the adipocyte with the largest median PM-LD distance in our dataset (1.78 microns), which had 9.13 caveolae per micron of PM perimeter. This corresponds to 83.36 caveolae per square μm of PM surface. Assuming a spherical morphology for caveolae and a typical value of 80 nm in diameter, the surface area for individual caveolae would correspond to 4·π·0.040 2 = 0.02 μm 2, and total caveolar area would be 0.02·83.36 = 1.67 μm 2 per μm 2 of PM. Thus, the fraction of caveolar membrane content per unit would be 1.67/ (1.67+1) = 0.63, meaning that caveolae comprise up to 63% of total adipocyte membrane surface area. Based on our analysis of caveolae disappearance as the LD grows (Fig. 1) and previous reports, about 90% of caveolae could completely flatten out. This magnitude of caveolae flattening would result in a final 1+0.9·1.67 = 2.50 μm 2 per initial μm 2 of PM, and thereby account for a 2.50x increase in cell surface, which would correspond to aincrease in adipocyte volume.

Calculation of area coverage percentage by circles in hexagonal packing arrangement

The maximum area covered by circles of radiusis achieved when they are arranged in a hexagonal lattice. Therefore, by computing the area of a hexagon (that tessellate the whole 2D space), and the area of the inscribed circle (Supplementary Fig. 2m), we can obtain the maximum fraction of area covered by circles as the ratio between both areas.

A hexagon would be composed by 12 triangles as shown in Supplementary Fig. 2m. From simple trigonometry calculations, we obtain the radius of the hexagon (L):

The base of the triangle would equal:

Lleading to a triangle area, A t:

The hexagon area (A h) will thus result:

The area of the inscribed circle is:

With this we obtain the fraction of hexagon covered by a circle:

Thus, packing of perfect circles would cover at most approximately 90.7% of the area.

2.1 Mesh decimation and smoothing

The accuracy of quantitative surface measures depends on the quality of the mesh. As surface reconstruction from MR images introduces noise, a more uniform, simplified, and smoothed mesh is necessary to reduce the irregularities of the original mesh (Dahnke & Gaser,) and improve the signal‐to‐noise ratio. To achieve this, we used quadratic edge collapse decimation with a target reduction value of 70% and Laplacian and Taubin smoothing (Ohtake, Belyaev, & Bogaevski; Sorkine; Taubin,) algorithms (Cignoni et al.) (Figure 2a, b). In a previous study, 70% down‐sampling of Freesurfer‐generated pial surfaces yielded an error value below 0.2 mm for both gyri and sulci (Tran & Fang). This decimation results in approximately 40 k vertices and 80 k triangles per hemisphere. Laplacian and Taubin smoothing are applied for 50 and 100 iterations, respectively. These values were found to avoid over‐smoothing and shrinkage of the surface while preserving the original topology (Figure 3). Less convoluted areas are covered with slightly fewer triangles and vice versa. To assess the quality of the decimated mesh, we compared the radius ratio and aspect ratio of its triangular elements before and after mesh decimation and smoothing using open‐source 3D mesh processing software Meshlab (Cignoni et al.). Radius ratio (Tecchio & Basso,) is the ratio of the radii of the circle inscribed in a triangle, and the triangle's circumsphere; it is calculated for triangleaswhere a is the total area of the triangle and, andare its edge lengths. Radius ratio ranges from 0 to 1, with an optimal value of 1 for an equilateral triangle. Aspect ratio is the ratio of a triangle's area to its longest edge length, with low values indicating stretched‐out obtuse triangles. After decimation, we observed 15% improvement in the radius and aspect ratios (Figure 4), particularly by eliminating many of the most distorted triangles.

### Mechanical control of neural plate folding by apical domain alteration [^78b03794]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

3D vertex model of furrow formation

In the 3D model, cells are represented as polyhedrons with near-constant volumearranged in a mono-layered sheet. The apical and basal sides of the cells are polygons, whereas the lateral sides are quadrilaterals; we use a model based on surface-tensions in cell sides –, expanded to also include an apical-perimeter-elasticity term. The energy function, therefore, readswhere the sum runs over allcells, andare the apical, basal, and lateral areas of the-th cell, whereas, andare the corresponding surface tensions and the factorarises because each lateral side is shared between two cells.andare the current and target apical perimeter of the-th cell, withbeing the perimeter elasticity modulus.is the volume of the-th cell, is the target cell volume, andis the bulk modulus.

To non-dimensionalize the model, we divide it by, so that the dimensionless energy now reads

Here, = and = are the dimensionless apical and basal surface tensions, respectively;, andare the apical, basal, and lateral dimensionless areas of the-th cell, respectively; andare the dimensionless actual and target apical perimeter of the-th cell, andis the dimensionless volume of that cell. The dimensionless perimeter elasticity modulus is given by = , whereas the dimensionless bulk modulus is given by = . We set, corresponding to a cuboidal tissue, = 1, and = 100. The target apical perimeter is set to equal the equilibrium apical perimeter of a cell without perimeter elasticity in a flat hexagonal honeycomb tissue, To model the constricting cells, we again set their target apical perimeter to equal to 10% of the target perimeter of non-constricting cells. We assume overdamped equations of motion, with dimensionless vertex positions now measured in units ofand dimensionless time in units of. The resulting equations of motion are solved using an explicit Euler scheme, with time step; model tissues are shown at.

The simulations again start with a regular hexagonal lattice. We set boundary conditions along the AP axis to be periodic, as the AP length of the hinge is much larger than its width. Boundary conditions perpendicular to AP are fixed. The simulated patch has 20 cells along the AP axis, and 40 perpendicular to it. As before, the outermost cells perpendicular to AP cannot change shape. Moreover, T1 transitions are again not allowed.

### Numerosity tuning in human association cortices and local image contrast representations in early visual cortex [^cac096fc]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

We also determined how well the relationship between aggregate Fourier power and numerosity generalizes across a much greater range of item sizes, spacings, and shapes that were not included in our fMRI experiments. We tested single circles from 1–240 pixels diameter placed at the image center. We then tested images of seven circles, each of diameter 16 pixels, spaced randomly but evenly within a 50–528 pixel diameter circular area. The minimum center-to-center distance increased with the group area. We then tested images of 16-pixel diameter circles from numerosity 1–175 within a 700-pixel diameter circular area, placed at least 24 pixels apart (edge-to-edge).

We then tested regular convex polygons from three corners (equilateral triangle) to ten corners (regular decagon), plus a circle (i.e. infinite corners), with all corners 30 pixels (radius) from the image center. We also tested regular stars with 3–10 points (at 30 pixels radius), interleaved with concave corners at 10 pixels radius. Spatial frequency differs with orientation in these shapes, so we determined the frequency of the first harmonic separately at each orientation and summed the PSD within the resulting area.

We finally tested pairs of dots with and without connecting elements to determine whether the effects of these connecting elements on Fourier power predict their effects on perception. All dots we 30 pixels in diameter. All bars were 4 pixels wide and the same length as the (edge-to-edge) distance between dots. Illusory contour inducers were 4 pixels wide, the same color as the background, and extending 10 pixels into the dot. To separate effects of connected configurations from changes to image properties, we included conditions where the bar or illusory contour inducer was split in the middle and rotated around the dot center.

To model predictions of the mean fMRI response to aggregate Fourier power (or any other non-numerical feature), we took the mean value over all displays of the same numerosity and stimulus configuration.

### Invariance properties of bacterial random walks in complex structures [^031312fd]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

The effect of size and shape

We have demonstrated that, for a fixed shape, the density of obstacles has a strong effect on the distribution of path lengths while leaving the mean value unchanged as long as the total internal accessible area remains the same.

We will now investigate the effects of shape and size on the path length distributions and again conclude that, although path distributions are very sensitive to the detailed geometry of the domain, mean path lengths and residence times can be accurately predicted using only the surface to perimeter ratio. We fabricate microstructures of circular, squared and triangular shapes all in four different sizes as shown in Fig. 2a. In all structures the obstacle density is fixed to N / S = 0.016 μm −2. All recorded trajectories are also plotted in Fig. 2a with a color map encoding the scaled path length L /. In Fig. 2b we plot for each structure the histogram of path lengths normalized by the expected valuein Eq. 4. As we move from circles to squares and then to triangles we observe that the corresponding histograms are characterized by larger frequencies for both short and long path lengths. The probability of short paths increases as we introduce convex corners and reduce their angle, as evidenced by the blue-violet color of the corners in squared and triangular structures. The presence of longer paths in triangles can be also understood noting that the normalized maximum straight paths for circles, square and triangles are respectively 4/ π,/ π and/ π (see Supplementary Fig. 2). Despite these qualitative and quantitative differences between histograms, mean path lengths are always close to 1 when normalized by the predicted valueas shown in Fig. 2b. The observed path length distributions can be very well reproduced by a Lorentz gas model where collisions with obstacles are described as instantaneous reorientation events. These events are assumed to occur with a constant probability per unit path length given by, where/ π is the rotational average cross section of line obstacles with length b (see Methods). For perfectly straight trajectories, circles and squares have path length distributions with a vertical asymptote. A strong peak is found at the location of this divergence and is progressively smeared as the linear size of the domain becomes larger than the mean free path. Upon increasing the size of the region a peak aroundappears due to bacteria that scatter close to the boundary, reorient and exit. The mix of these two types of trajectories gives rise to the observed double-peak structure. Differently for the triangle no asymptote is present in the P (L) for large λ, therefore only a peak atprogressively appears. These results show that P (L) depends strongly on the random walk properties (as the mean free path), and on the domain features (shape and size). Differently the mean valuesanddepend only on the surface to perimeter ratio of the domain as expressed by Eq. 4. Experimental values ofare shown Fig. 3a for all shapes and sizes. We find an excellent agreement with theory using the same value s = 6.3 μm 2 that was used previously to predict the experimental values ofas a function of the number of obstacles (see Fig. 1c). This value of s has also been used to calculateaccording to Eq. 5 which captures quantitatively well the experimental data as shown in Fig. 3b.

### Subicular neurons encode concave and convex geometries [^d1461789]. Nature (2024). Excellent credibility.

Behavioural experiments with imaging

After mice had fully recovered from the surgery, they were handled and allowed to habituate to wearing the head-mounted miniscope by freely exploring an open arena for 20 min every day for one week. The actual experiments took place in a different room from the habituation. The behaviour rig, an 80/20 built compartment, in this dedicated room had two white walls and one black wall with salient decorations as distal visual cues, which were kept constant over the course of the entire study. For experiments described below, all the walls of the arenas were acrylic and were tightly wrapped with black paper by default to reduce potential reflections from the LEDs on the scope. A local visual cue was always available on one of the walls in the arena, except for the oval environment. In each experiment, the floors of the arenas were covered with corn bedding. All animals' movements were voluntary.

Circle, equilateral triangle, square, hexagon and low-wall square

This set of experiments was carried out in a circle, an equilateral triangle, a square, a hexagon and a low-wall square environment. The diameter of the circle was 35 cm. The side lengths were 30 cm for the equilateral triangle and square, and 18.5 cm for the hexagon. The height of all the environments was 30 cm except for the low-wall square, which was 15 cm. In total, we conducted 15, 18, 17, 18 and 12 sessions (20 min per session) from nine mice in the circular, triangular, square, hexagonal and low-wall square arenas, respectively. We recorded a maximum of two sessions per condition per mouse. For each mouse, we recorded 1–2 sessions in each day. If two sessions were made from the same animal on a given day, recordings were carried out from different conditions with at least a two-hour gap between sessions. For each mouse, data from this set of experiments were aligned and concatenated, and the activity of neurons was tracked across the sessions. As described above, all the walls of the arenas were black. A local visual cue (strips of white masking tape) was present on one wall of each arena, covering the top half of the wall. For CA1 imaging, mice were placed into a familiar 25 × 25 cm square environment for a single, 20 min session recording.

### Controlled packing and single-droplet resolution of 3D-printed functional synthetic tissues [^1507b7a6]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

In hexagonally packed regions of droplet network replicas, a droplet in the second or third layer was surrounded by 12 droplets, which formed 12 DIBs — producing the space-filling trapezo-rhombic dodecahedron (D 3h) (Fig. 5d) expected for hcp. Horizontal cross-sections of these polyhedra showed a regular hexagon at the midpoint (Fig. 5h), with two aligned equilateral triangles near the top and bottom (Fig. 5g, i). In contrast to what we saw for hcp, horizontal sections of a polyhedron in a face-centred cubic lattice — a rhombic dodecahedron (O h) — would show two equilateral triangles, near the top and the bottom of the polyhedron, rotated by 60° with respect to each other. Droplets at the bottom of a network (touching the glass) were surrounded by nine droplets and formed ten-faced polyhedra (C 3v) with a flat circular face due to bilayer formation at the quartz surface (Supplementary Fig. 9h–k). Droplets at the periphery (at the top and sides of a network) formed polyhedra with ten faces or less, and with a curved face arising from the oil–water interface (Supplementary Fig. 9l–p).

### Shape morphing of plastic films [^a96c261a]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Polygons

The adhesive layer was parallelly aligned with certain intervals. The width of the adhesive layer (w a) was calculated from the interior angles ɵ and the diameter of the peeled-off film, d, where w a = (180− ɵ) π d /360. The intervals are equal to the corresponding side length. Taking right triangle with interior angles of 60° and the shortest side length of 10 mm as an example, the diameter of peeled-off PTFE film (thickness of 80 μm, width of 4 mm) with Kapton tape as the adhesive layer and a peeling angle of 180° is 2 mm; thus, the widths of adhesive layers should be 2.62, 1.57, 2.09 and 2.62 mm, respectively, and the corresponding intervals should be 17.3, 10 and 20 mm, respectively (Fig. 3e). The PTFE film (thickness of 80 μm, width of 4 mm) was adhered vertical to the adhesive layer and peeled off at peeling angle of 180°. For an isosceles right triangle with a short side length of 10 mm, the widths of adhesive layers should be 2.36, 1.57, 2.36, and 2.36 mm, respectively, and the corresponding intervals should be 10, 10, and 14.1 mm, respectively. For an equilateral triangle with a side length of 10 mm, the widths of adhesive layers should be 2.09, 2.09, 2.09, and 2.09 mm, respectively, and the corresponding intervals should be 10, 10 and 10 mm, respectively. For the equilateral polygon with a side length of 10 mm, the widths of adhesive layers are 1.57, 1.26, and 1.05 mm with intervals of 10 mm for quadrangle, pentagon and hexagon, respectively.

### Physical basis for the determination of lumen shape in a simple epithelium [^e7bb641a]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

To further explore how these treatments altered lumen shape, we calculated the solidity of lumen cross-sectional shapes. The solidity metric is defined as the ratio of the lumen area and the area of its convex hull (Fig. 2d). A value of 1 describes completely convex shapes, such as an ellipse or a regular polygon, while lower values reflect varying degrees of surface concavity. We chose to evaluate lumen shape by this metric because it could capture the variations in lumen shape concavity that other 2D metrics we tested did not. We also calculated how similar or dissimilar individual luminal cross-sections were to circles by calculating the isoperimetric quotient (IPQ), given by:for lumen cross-sectional area a, and lumen cross-sectional perimeter p. A value of 1 for this metric represents a perfect circle. To determine how these metrics change with lumen size we plotted them against a normalized lumen radius, the ratio between the estimated lumen radius and the mean cell width (Fig. 2d). This normalization accounts for the difference between lumens of the same size but surrounded by thicker or thinner cells. Independent of treatment with ddAVP, ouabain, or water vehicle control, the solidity and IPQ of lumens showed the same abrupt transition to values close to 1 with increasing relative lumen size (Fig. 2e and Supplementary Fig. 2c). Although control and ddAVP treated lumens were statistically distinguishable by a 2D Kolmogorov–Smirnov test, differences in lumen shape were modest in practice (Fig. 2a, e). Thus, for lumens of approximately four to tens of cells, modulating fluid pumping via ddAVP or ouabain did not strongly influence lumen shape.

### Engineering an anti-HER2 biparatopic antibody with a multimodal mechanism of action [^45cbd5b1]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Simulation of HER2 nanolever crosslinking

The surface interlinking simulation consisted of three consecutive steps. At first, a square surface with a given side length (1 µm in all images) was divided into equally sized hexagons with an in-radius of 2.5 nm. Each of these areas will (potentially) hold one DNA lever at its center. The in-radius of 2.5 nm guaranteed a minimum distance between DNA levers of 5 nm, which is an approximate physical density limit based on DNA radius and electrostatic repulsion between DNA molecules. Second, each of the defined hexagons was checked for whether it should contain a DNA molecule. The probability of a hexagon containing a DNA molecule is equal to the ratio of the hexagon area and the area of another hexagon with in-radius equal to half of a given distance between DNA levers. This way, the DNA levers were stochastically distributed over the surface but maintain a given average distance. Third, the interlinking molecules were introduced one-by-one to the surface. Each molecule was bound randomly to a DNA lever with a free binding site. After the molecule's initial binding, it bound to the closest neighboring DNA lever (with free binding site), which it could reach (including the length of both DNA levers and the molecule). If no second binding partner was found, the molecule was left singly bound. Each molecule that binds reduces the number of free binding sites of a DNA lever by one. Initially, each DNA lever starts with two free binding sites. Once all binding sites were occupied, the total number of DNA levers interlinked through bound molecules was compared to the total number of initial DNA levers. The binding of molecules was repeated ten times on ten individual surfaces. The size for each simulated surface density was chosen so that boundary effects are negligible.

### Structural puzzles in virology solved with an overarching icosahedral design principle [^5f77ba37]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Methods

The construction of the polyhedral models and their duals is described below.

Construction of polyhedral designs

Consider two lines intersecting at an angle of 60° at the centre of one of the hexagons in the hexagonal (sub)lattice of a given Archimedean lattice. Counting steps between midpoints of adjacent hexagons along these lines via the integer coordinatesand, thencharacterises the positions of other hexagons in the (sub)lattice with respect to the original one, i.e. Using the line connecting the midpoints of these hexagons as the edge of an equilateral triangle of an icosahedral face (Supplementary Fig. 1), the position of the remainder of that surface is uniquely determined, andthus defines a planar embedding of an icosahedral surface into the Archimedean lattice (see examples in Fig. 2). The corresponding polyhedral shape in three dimensions is an icosahedron, obtained via identification of edges of the planar embedding. The numbers of pentagonal, hexagonal, triangular and square faces in the Archimedean lattice overlapping with this icosahedral surface for different values ofandare provided in Supplementary Tables 1–4 for the hexagonal, trihexagonal, snub hexagonal and rhombitrihexagonal lattice, respectively. In particular, an icosahedral face given bycontains either no additional face (hexagonal case), one triangle (trihexagonal case), four triangles (snub hexagonal case), or one triangle and a square (rhombitrihexagonal case), that each form the start of an infinite series of polyhedra.

Construction of the dual lattices

For each polyhedron in the above classification, we construct a dual polyhedron. For this, vertices are positioned at the centres of the polyhedral faces, and vertices associated with adjacent faces connected by straight lines. Since Archimedean lattices have a single type of vertex environment, these dual polyhedra each have a single type of face that corresponds to the fundamental domain of a Laves lattice. These faces are triangles, rhombs, florets and kites for the hexagonal, trihexagonal, snub hexagonal and rhombitrihexagonal lattice, respectively. Using again the planar embedding of an icosahedral surface into the associated Archimedean lattice, we determine the numbers of each such face for polyhedra characterised byandas above; their numbers are listed in Supplementary Table 5.

### Mechanical control of neural plate folding by apical domain alteration [^fa0e0350]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Cell elongation can arise passively from the presence of interspersed contractile cells

The heterogeneity of apical domains in the neural plate indicates that only a subset of the cells undergo apical constriction. We asked whether the observed cell behavior in the tissue can be explained as a mechanical consequence of apical contractility. We therefore analyzed a 2D vertex model – of the neural plate epithelium. In a 2D vertex model, each cell is represented as a polygon and defined by the position of its vertices. An energy is chosen for the model tissue, and the vertices are then assumed to follow overdamped dynamics towards an energy minimum. In this case, we use the usual area-and-perimeter elasticity energy, which sets a target area and perimeter value for each cell. The energy, therefore, readswhere the sum runs over allcells, andare the area and the perimeter, respectively, of the-th cell, whereasis its target perimeter; is the perimeter elasticity modulus (this is the dimensionless form of the energy; see Methods). We setand, just below the perimeter of a regular hexagon of area 1, and started the simulation with a regular hexagonal lattice. Abyrectangular region (blue border in Fig. 3a) represents the posterior region of the neural plate. Here, corresponds to the length along the AP axis, andthe length perpendicular to the AP axis. The model posterior neural plate is embedded in abysimulated tissue. Unless stated otherwise, we set, and.

To assess whether cluster positions formed a regular hexagonal structure with learning in a comparable manner way to grid cells found in the medial entorhinal cortex (mEC), we followed the method of Hafting et al.and Perez-Escobar et al.

In Hafting et al. rodents traversed circular and square environments whilst they recorded electrophysiological signals from mEC neurons. They found cells that displayed multiple firing fields and resembled a grid of regularly tessellating triangles spanning the recorded environment. To assess this regularity quantitatively, they computed the spatial autocorrelogram of the firing rate map. If the fields were arranged in a regular grid, the center peak of the autocorrelogram should be surrounded by six equidistance peaks, forming a regular hexagon. The spatial autocorrelogram was computed as follows. Withdenoting the cluster activation at location, the autocorrelation with spatial lags of τ x and τ y was estimated as:whereis the autocorrelation between bins offset of τ x and τ y, andare equivalent for an autocorrelation indicates the average firing rate of the cell in each location, and n is the number of spatial bins over which the estimation was made.

To quantify the degree of this regularity, a 'grid score' is commonly usedby computing the correlation between the center region of the spatial autocorrelogram (a masked region including the six surrounding peaks but excluding the centre peak) and a 60° and 120° rotated version (to assess the six-fold hexagonal symmetry) minus the correlation between the spatial autocorrelograms and a 30°, 90°, and 150° rotated version (where there should be a low correlation):

To assess the regularity of the cluster positions in a given environment in the current study and compare our results with empirical findings, we followed the method described above. We first computed activation maps to emulate firing rate maps in empirical neuronal recordings, and computed the spatial autocorrelogram to obtain the grid score.

### Entropy-driven formation of chiral nematic phases by computer simulations [^325fb91c]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

As we explain below, this particle model presents several shape features that can be easily tuned, e.g. aspect ratio, convexity, biaxiality, handedness, degree of twist (or molecular pitch) and number of polyhedral faces. A systematic study of how these properties, some of which are intuitively associated to microscopic chirality and liquid-crystalline behaviour, affect the self-assembly of many of such particles, can be efficiently carried out by performing computer simulations. In particular, here we study the nematic phase behaviour of the simplest shape of this class, i.e. twisted triangular prisms (TTP). Our particle is obtained by twisting one base of an elongated triangular prism of height h by an angle α relative to the other base and by adding additional edges to ensure flat faces (Fig. 1). Remarkably, depending on the choice of which vertices are connected by these additional edges, it is possible to build both concave and convex chiral particles. The triangular base has fixed perimeter πω, such that in the limit of infinite number of sides (circle) the width ω coincides with particle diameter. In this study we consider concave TTPs with either equilateral or isosceles triangular bases defined by the base angle γ. When the top triangular base is rotated clockwise the twist angle α is positive and it is tempting to call the TTP right handed. We return to this definition of particle handedness when we discuss our results for the oblate (discotic) cholesteric phases. We note that α should be less than or equal to the smallest angle of the base to avoid self-intersection of the particle shape. For convenience, we also introduce the vectors u, v and w describing the TTP as shown in Fig. 1, which allow us to define the long, medium and short dimensions of the TTP by their length | u |, | v | and | w |, whereas the particle frame is described by the long, medium and short particle axis denoted by the unit vectors,… Note that the height h coincides with | u |. To detect overlaps between particles, i.e. the key ingredient in Monte Carlo (MC) simulations aimed to study the self-assembly of hard particles, we implement an algorithm based on triangle–triangle intersection detection using the RAPID library, which is also suitable for concave shapes. Analogously to spherocylinders(and other hard-rod models), the nematic phase can be stabilized at sufficiently high aspect ratio (h / ω), whereas the particle chirality can be tuned by changing the twist angle α that also changes the molecular pitch. Additionally, by further modifying the particle shape (changing the base) we study how the competition between biaxiality and chirality propagates from microscopic (single particle) to macroscopic (self-assembled structure) level.

### Tumour evolution and microenvironment interactions in 2D and 3D space [^1e07c535]. Nature (2024). Excellent credibility.

Tumour microregion annotation and layer determination

Using Visium ST, tumour microregions were determined through a multistep process using H&E. Each ST spot was assigned as either stroma or tumour by manually reviewing the morphology on H&E stained sections. If at least 50% of the pixels within a spot covered malignant cell morphology, the spot was labelled as tumour. Otherwise, it was labelled as stroma. Next, we defined distinct tumour microregions using a set of three rules. The first rule specified that tumour spots immediately adjacent to one another are initially marked as a single tumour microregion. The second rule states that if two distinct tumour regions together occupied at least 50% of one single spot, the spot is assigned to the distinct tumour region with the higher percentage occupied. Finally, the third rule specified that if there was a clear morphological difference of the tumour spots within one tumour microregion, the microregion must be separated into distinct microregions, one per clear morphology.

Afterwards, we ran the Morph toolset, which uses mathematical morphology to refine the tumour microregions. That is, if the total number of spots in a microregion is less than or equal to three, then we labelled all such spots as stroma. Last, Morph assigned the layer (for example, T1) of each spot of a tumour microregion by a sequence of mathematical morphology operations described in the Spot-depth correlation analysis method, which denotes the depth of a given spot inside a microregion.

Average spot area and microregion size calculation

To calculate the area each spot takes, we used the spot size (55 µm) and centre-to-centre distance between each spot (100 µm) provided by 10x Genomics. As illustrated in Supplementary Fig. 6, the Visium spots form a hexagonal lattice that covers the sample. The repeating unit of this lattice is a trapezoid shape centred at each spot's centre that is composed of eight equilateral triangles. Each triangle has a side of 50 µm (half of the spot the centre-to-centre distance). Using the area equation of equilateral triangles and multiplying it by 8, we obtained the area of each trapezoid as 8,660 µm 2, which is the average area occupied by each spot. To calculate the microregion size, we multiplied the spot count by 8,660 and divided by 10 6 to obtain the size in mm 2.

### Transition metal dichalcogenide metamaterials with atomic precision [^4b92bbb7]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Discussion

The appearance of ultranarrow features displayed in Fig. 4, together with the data presented earlier, points towards the mechanism of the anisotropic wet etching. Specifically, in a TMD of a general formula MX 2 there exist many types of edge states, including both X- and M-terminated zigzag edges. The hypothesis is that these different zigzag and armchair edges are likely different in terms of their chemical stability against etching by hydrogen peroxide (this hypothesis is supported by earlier literature studying the opposite behavior of S- and Mo-edges in chemical vapor deposition grown MoS 2 clusters). Thus, etching of a MX 2 monolayer likely results in survival of only one type of the zigzag edges, whichever is more stable (the armchair configuration does not withstand the wet etching process). This is partially confirmed in Supplementary Fig. 13, which shows that anisotropic etching of a monolayer results in an equilateral triangle, instead of a hexagon (note that the structure of an equilateral triangle requires that all edges within the structure have the same X- or M-zigzag termination). In 2H-stacked multilayers, which most common TMDs follow, the X- and M-terminated zigzag edges within a hexagon overlap each other in a vertical stack. This vertical sequencing likely makes the hexagonal arrangement ultimately possible in a multilayer TMD configuration. We note, however, that future studies are required to confirm this hypothesis and the exact mechanism of anisotropic etching process studied here is likely more complex.

### Controlled packing and single-droplet resolution of 3D-printed functional synthetic tissues [^3b7915f7]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Classifying packing types

To estimate the proportion of packing types within each network, we first generated a mesh over the print by performing a Delaunay triangulation using the centres of all regions classified as droplets as the input points. A convenient property of this triangulation method is that the circumcircle of each triangle contains no other points; each triangle therefore represents a triplet of neighbouring droplets and provides localised geometrical information about their arrangements.

The plot of the bivariate distribution of the largest angle of each triangle vs the triangle area normalised by the average droplet area for all prints revealed two distinct clusters of triangles, one corresponding to hexagonally packed droplet regions, and one corresponding to square-packed droplet regions (Supplementary Fig. 3 d). Reasoning that these represented stable configurations of droplets for certain printing parameters, we classified each triangle using these clusters. Four packing categories were used: 'hexagonal' (closely packed triplets of droplets arranged as equilateral triangles), 'square' (closely packed triplets of droplets arranged as right-angled triangles), 'amorphous' (closely packed triplets of droplets of intermediate arrangement) and 'no packing' (triplets of droplets that are not close-packed). For a hexagonal classification. For an amorphous classification. For a square classification. In addition, for all of these classes. Triangles that fell outside of these ranges were classified as no packing (Supplementary Fig. 3 d).

Some elongated 'sliver' triangles were classified as being a member of one of the closely packed classes, despite being composed of widely spaced droplets. Closer analysis of these triangles revealed that they were generally composed of two closely packed droplets and a single more distant droplet, together forming a skinny near-isosceles triangle. We therefore applied an additional constraint based on the perimeter of each triangle normalised by the average droplet radius. Since for perfect hexagonal packing, and for a perfect square packing, we set the constraintfor the closely packed classes based on a linear interpolation between these two points. Our chosen y -intercept for this constraint is slightly greater than the theoretical y -intercept from the interpolation, allowing triangles with small deviations from the perfect packing geometry to be classified as closely packed while still ensuring classification of sliver triangles as no packing.

Development of mathematical IgM–VSG coat binding interface model

To approximate the binding "footprint" of a pentameric IgM molecule on the VSG coat, we first modeled the VSG coat as a regularly spaced hexagonal grid, as has been shown in previous studies. A regular hexagon of height h has six sides of length equal to (h /3 1/2). A hexagon with a height of 40 nm (the upper estimate of the diameter of an IgM molecule) thus has sides of length ~23.1 nm. If such a hexagon has five VSG homodimers on each side, they will be equally spaced at ~5.8 nm (23.1 nm/4 inter-homodimer spaces), a value extremely close to previously estimated homodimer spacing (5.7 nm spacing with a random displacement up to 0.5 nm). Filling this hexagon with additional VSG homodimers at the same spacing, we estimated that 61 VSG homodimers (or 122 VSG monomers) would be within reach of a single IgM with a 40 nm diameter (Fig. 4b, c). The same calculations were performed for IgM with a 30 nm diameter (Supplementary Fig. 4): 30 nm/3 1/2 gives a side length of ~17.3 nm. Assuming four VSG homodimers on each side, they will again be equally spaced at ~5.8 nm (17.3 nm/3 inter-homodimer spaces). Filling this hexagon results in 37 VSG homodimers (or 74 VSG monomers) within reach of a single IgM with a 30 nm diameter.

### Electronically decoupled stacking fault tetrahedra embedded in Au (111) films [^85b58c1a]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

Deviations of the experimental data in Fig. 5 from the theoretical model may be attributed at least partially to deviations from the assumed idealized hexagonal (truncated triangular) shape. In particular, deviations in Fig. 5 are most pronounced for the smaller SFTs such as the one in Fig. 4a. For these smaller SFTs, the precise shape can be observed less clearly in STM images and it may be more close to that of a triangle rather than a hexagon. In addition, electron scattering at the subsurface SF planes of the SFT may affect the ideal particle-in-a-box type confinement of electrons.

Finally, as indicated above, the exposed surfaces of the Au SFTs all have a regular crystalline shape, that is, the shape of a hexagon or truncated triangle. Exceptionally, an equilateral, triangularly shaped defect-like feature is found (only one observation, see Supplementary Fig. 5). The arrangement of the herringbone ridges at the triangular shaped feature differs from that of the other SFTs (Supplementary Fig. 5a). Moreover, the triangular feature exhibits an electronic behaviour that differs from the other SFTs. It shows the Au(111) bulk conduction band similar to the surrounding Au(111) surface (Supplementary Fig. 5k). In addition, wave patterns can already be observed in LDOS maps at voltages close to the Fermi level (Supplementary Fig. 5f, g), while the SFTs discussed above reveal wave patterns only above 1,490 mV. The resolved wave patterns (Supplementary Fig. 5e–i) and resonance in the STS spectrum (Supplementary Fig. 5j) can be interpreted as confinement of the bare Au(111) surface state (Supplementary Fig. 5j) following the particle-in-a-box model with E 0 = −460 meV and m ✱ = 0.23 m e, similar to the results reported in ref.for Au islands. This triangular feature therefore must have a different structure than the other Au SFTs. The triangular feature may be interpreted as a so-called Frank loop, consisting of a single stacking fault. The Frank loop is very similar to the SFT in terms of the spatial coordinates of atoms.

### A critical edge number revealed for phase stabilities of two-dimensional ball-stick polygons [^7f4de52a]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

The octagon system stabilizes at the triangular lattice up to a finite temperature when it transforms into a rotator crystal phase discontinuously. The rotator crystal of octagon has roughly three preferred body-orientations of monomers, as shown in Fig. 6g, h, similar to the case for hard octagon. However, the body-orientation distribution is very rough and the ranges between peaks and valleys are much smaller than that of the discrete rotator crystal phase for hexagon. The melting scenario follows a regular solid-liquid one at relatively low pressures (P = 0–5). The hexatic phase appears at higher pressures of P = 5–8 and leads to a hard-disk-like behavior, qualitatively the same as the L-J disk. The phase diagram of the octagon system is drawn in Fig. 7c, showing that there are always two solid states, and the hexatic region is very narrow at high pressures and disappears at low pressures.

Phase stabilities

To gain a deeper understanding on the mechanism of phase stabilities, we plot the melting points of different crystalline structures under different pressures in Fig. 8. The melting point increases with pressure and is higher for polygons with more edges at relatively high pressures, which is regarded as the entropy-dominant regime. Meanwhile, the melting-temperature curves for hexagon and octagon have a crossover point located between P = 1 and P = 1.5. At relatively low pressures, hexagon stays in the triangular-lattice crystal phase before melting into liquid, and has a higher melting point than octagon. By contrast, at relatively high pressures, hexagon is in the rotator crystal phase before melting into liquid, and has a melting point lower than octagon. Therefore, the crossover of the melting point locates in the pressure interval where the rotator crystal phase for hexagon appears. Detailed examination on the local structure of triangular-lattice crystal morphology suggests that, as shown in Fig. 6d and much clearer in Fig. 9d, each atom has two neighboring atoms belonging to two different molecules, and these three atoms form a regular triangular local structure, which is the most stable structure of an L-J cluster composed of three atoms. In other words, the crystal phase for hexagon has the intermolecular interaction perfectly matches the molecular shape, leading to an ultra-stability at low pressures when the phase stability is dominated by enthalpy.

### Entorhinal and transentorhinal atrophy in mild cognitive impairment using longitudinal diffeomorphometry [^816be212]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2017). Low credibility.

2.4 Longitudinal mapping

We overcome variability in anatomic definitions over time by mapping our template simultaneously onto each scan in a time series. Our approach is to define two geodesic trajectories parametrized by the functions p 0 and p 1. This results in diffeomorphisms(from template to baseline), indexed by, andfrom baseline through the time series, indexed bywith.

We are given a template segmentation I 0 and a target family of target segmentations J ij at times t ij for. We seek to minimize the data fidelity functionwhereis the L 2 norm of a scalar-valued function, defined byandis a positive real number controlling the relative weight of the data fidelity term in our cost function.

In addition, we include regularization terms of the formThis is the norm of the initial velocity vector field on our reproducing kernel Hilbert space of smooth functions. Seefor details. Optimal mappings are computed by minimizing the cost function

forandpositive real numbers controlling the relative weight of each regularization term. This implementation is discussed inwith computational details including graphics processing unit performance discussed in.

2.5 Global volume measurement

At each time point, we measure the volume of the region by summing voxels in the segmentation images and multiplying by the voxel size. When images are not binary due to linear interpolation on rigid alignment, we sum their interpolated value, which we interpret as a voxel that is fractionally filled by the anatomy of interest.

2.6 Local measurements

Local atrophy measurements are calculated from properties of the mappings. The local change in volume between template and subject i time j is estimated at each vertex x k of our triangulated surface as the determinant of the Jacobian of the mapping.

The local change in thickness is estimated as the ratio of the Jacobian determinant to the local change in surface area ("volume equals surface area times thickness"). This approach is valid when the template is a thin laminar structure like the ERC and TEC. Local surface area change is estimated by computing, for each triangular face of our template, the deformed triangle area divided by the template triangle area. This measure is interpolated from faces to vertices by assigning to each vertex the sum of 1/3 of the value at its neighboring faces. This choice of interpolation preserves the total area.

where S i is the area of cell i, L j is the length of edge j, L k is the length of outermost edge k, and K S, K B, K R, K E and L E are constants. The first term of the right-hand side represents area elasticity, where cell i has a target area s i that depends on its edge number N i and is given by the relative area of N i -sided regular polygon to that of regular hexagon, namely, s i = N i tan(π /6)/6 tan(π / N i). K S denotes the elastic constant. The second term describes the conservation force of edge length, where each edge has the target lengthat which the potential energy function reaches a minimum. This condition ensures that neighbouring vertices do not become extremely close because of repulsive force. The third term indicates the elastic force that maintains the outermost edges at a constant length L E with the elastic coefficient K E, which reflects that the outer cell wall is usually thickened and stiffened by a cuticle.

In animal cell models, it is usually assumed that vertices are reconnected to mimic cell movement if an edge becomes extremely short. In contrast, because the plant cell wall prevents changes in the relative position of cells, such reconnection process is not permitted in our model. In addition, neighbouring vertices are prohibited to be extremely close by potential energy as described above.

Programmes were written in C and the vertex position (x j) was iteratively calculated every time step Δ t = 0.005, using the fourth-order Runge–Kutta method.

### Microstructure of a spatial map in the entorhinal cortex [^8f3c3689]. Nature (2005). Excellent credibility.

The ability to find one's way depends on neural algorithms that integrate information about place, distance and direction, but the implementation of these operations in cortical microcircuits is poorly understood. Here we show that the dorsocaudal medial entorhinal cortex (dMEC) contains a directionally oriented, topographically organized neural map of the spatial environment. Its key unit is the 'grid cell', which is activated whenever the animal's position coincides with any vertex of a regular grid of equilateral triangles spanning the surface of the environment. Grids of neighbouring cells share a common orientation and spacing, but their vertex locations (their phases) differ. The spacing and size of individual fields increase from dorsal to ventral dMEC. The map is anchored to external landmarks, but persists in their absence, suggesting that grid cells may be part of a generalized, path-integration-based map of the spatial environment.

where n is the number of clusters. We can interpret this ratio as the following: the numerator indicates intra cluster distance, in which a smaller value shows that each distinct cluster is tightly bounded. A larger denominator value implies that the inter clusters are well separated from each other. Thus, if the α value is generally small, we can conclude that the algorithm performs well.
2. The intersection area can be seen as computing the overlap between two clusters. We first remove the outliers (see Figure 1) (Tony, Ming, & Zhi‐Hua,) to compute the convex hull for each group and use them to measure the overlap. For the intersection area, we find the area of each polytope(cluster) and find the total area by summing them. After that we compute the overlap area between each cluster. In specific, this is done by summing all of the polytope areas minus the area of the union of all the polytopes, normalized by the area of the union. The lower value of intersection area determines the formation of good cluster with less overlap.
Roundness is the ratio of the area of each polytope to the area of the circumscribed circle. To compute the roundness of each cluster, we first represent each cluster as a cloud with a convex hull. To remove the effect of the differences in perimeters, we normalize the perimeters. This normalization effectively approximates the process of making the perimeters equal. Finally, we compute the area of the polytope and use the area as our measure of roundness. The higher roundness metric value determines the good quality of the cluster. More precisely, it quantifies how the samples are distributed around the mean of a given cluster.

### The 30-degree angle revisited [^eec48357]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

The standard surgical ellipse, with 30 degrees apical angles and a length-to-width ratio of 2 or 3 to 1, works optimally on a flat surface. The same pattern, when used for excisions on strongly convex or concave surfaces, leads to distortions which may require significant revisions. The reason for these discrepancies is explainable by the mathematical differences between flat Euclidian geometry and curved non-Euclidian geometry. Understanding these basic mathematical principles as applied to cutaneous surgery should lead to better preoperative planning, fewer intraoperative surprises, and more pleasing results.

### Feasibility and coexistence of large ecological communities [^02d41162]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Shape of the feasibility domain

So far, we have focused on the volume of the parameter space resulting in feasiblity. However, two systems having the same Ξ can still have very different responses to parameter perturbations, just as two triangles having the same area need not to have sides of the same length (Fig. 1). The two extreme cases correspond to (a) an isotropic system in which if we start at the barycentre of the feasibility domain, moving in any direction yields roughly the same effect (equivalent to an equilateral triangle); (b) anisotropic systems, in which the feasibility domain is much narrower in certain directions than in others (as in a scalene triangle). For our problem, the domain of growth rates leading to coexistence is — once the growth rates are normalized — the (S −1)-dimensional generalization of a triangle on a hypersphere. For S = 3, this domain is indeed a triangle lying on a sphere as shown in Fig. 1. If all the S (S −1)/2 sides of this (hyper-)triangle are about the same length, then different perturbations will have similar effects on the system. On the other hand, if some sides are much shorter than others, then there will be changes of conditions which will more likely have an impact on coexistence than others. We therefore consider a measure of the heterogeneity in the distribution of the side lengths (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Note 10). The larger the variance of this distribution, the more likely it is that certain perturbations can destroy coexistence, even when Ξ is large and the perturbation small. This way of measuring heterogeneity is particularly convenient because it is independent of the initial conditions. Moreover, the length of each side can be directly related to the similarity between the corresponding pair of species (Supplementary Note 10), drawing a strong connection between the parameter space allowing for coexistence and the phenotypic space. As in the case of Ξ, this measure is a function of the interaction matrix and corresponds to a geometrical property of the coexistence domain.

### Egocentric neural representation of geometric vertex in the retrosplenial cortex [^ff94d57a]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Neural representation of geometric vertex in the granular RSC

First, we investigated whether the neural representation of geometric vertices exists in the RSC. To do so, we injected AAV-CaMKII-GCaMP6s into the granular layers of RSC and recorded Ca 2+ signals from a total of 740 GCaMP6s-expressing excitatory neurons using a miniaturized microscope in nine mice (Fig. 1a, b). From the ΔF/F o Ca 2+ signals acquired from the granular RSC neurons, we extracted deconvoluted spikes (Fig. 1b) to plot neural activities while mice freely explored open chambers of different environmental geometries. We used a circular open chamber (radius of 25 cm) and three different shapes of regular polygon open chambers that had distinct numbers of vertices. The dimensions of regular polygon-shaped open chambers were chosen so that they can be inscribed into the circular open chamber, so as to keep the center-to-vertex distance constant (25 cm) (Fig. 1c). In a circular open chamber, the granular RSC neuronal spikes tessellated along the entire circumference (Fig. 1c, d), which is similar to RSC neuronal responses previously reported in rats. However, in regular polygon-shaped open chambers, subpopulations of granular RSC neurons spiked exclusively near the vertices (Fig. 1c, d, Supplementary Movie 1). When the regular polygon-shaped open chambers were morphed from a square to a 24-gon using 8 cm-wide walls while keeping the total perimeter constant across chambers, vertex-selective spiking was still observed in the square, hexagon, and octagon open chambers, but vertex-selective spiking diminished in the 12-gon and 24-gons (Supplementary Fig. 1), indicating there may be a spatial resolution (edge length > 16 cm) required in detecting vertices of the environmental geometry. The spatial patterns of vertex-selective RSC neuronal receptive fields (Fig. 1c, d) were different from grid cells, as all RSC neurons had low grid scoresin a square chamber (Supplementary Fig. 2). Additionally, they were distinctively different from boundary vector cellsor border cellsas subpopulations of RSC neurons fired exclusively near the vertex located farthest away from the center, as shown in the population responses of RSC neurons as a function of distance from vertex (Fig. 1e) and at either end of the edge (Fig. 1f). To quantitatively analyze the vertex-selective neuronal characteristics, we defined the vertex score. The vertex score was calculated by taking the distance from the spatial bin with the maximum spike firing rate within the spatial receptive field to the nearest vertex, which was then normalized by the largest possible distance to the vertex in a given chamber. The resulting vertex scores ranged from 0 to 1, where 0 indicated that the spatial receptive fields were located farthest away from all vertices, and 1 indicated that the spatial receptive fields were located exclusively at any of the vertices. A given RSC neuron was defined as a vertex cell within each chamber if the vertex score exceeded the 95 th percentile of the probability distribution of randomly shuffled vertex scores in any of the regular polygon-shaped open chambers (Fig. 1g), and if it showed stable spatial receptive fields during the entire 30-min recording sessions. Based on vertex score analysis, in each chamber, 32%, 32%, and 33% of RSC neurons (234, 234, and 247 out of 740 neurons) were vertex cells in triangle, square, and hexagon chambers, respectively (Fig. 1g) (Supplementary Fig. 3), while 9% of RSC neurons (66 out of 740 neurons) sustained vertex cell responses in all three different open chambers (Fig. 1h, left). Overall, across the three open chambers, granular RSC neurons that are defined as vertex cells in any one of the chambers were 60% (443 out of 740 neurons), with similar ratio of vertex cells observed in each animal (Fig. 1h, right). Among the imaged granular RSC neuronal populations, a high proportion of granular RSC neurons were vertex cells that spiked exclusively near the vertices while being inhibited at the center of the open chamber as well as the edge (Fig. 1i). However, subpopulations of non-vertex cells in the granular RSC were found to be border cells (27%, 200 out of 740 neurons, Supplementary Fig. 4a–c) while subpopulations of vertex cells showed conjunctive responses to both vertices and borders (16%, 122 out of 740 neurons, Supplementary Fig. 5).

For these three polygons, the ground-state crystalline structures: striped phase for pentagon, triangular lattice for both hexagon and octagon, can be stabilized until their melting temperatures, attributed to the even weaker confliction between interaction and shape. The snapshots of these crystalline configurations are shown in Fig. 6a, b, and g, respectively. Below we describe the melting scenarios of each polygon under various pressures, and the readers are referred to the Methods section and SI for more details on the calculation procedure and results.

### Nuclear morphology is a deep learning biomarker of cellular senescence [^e0568907]. Nature Aging (2022). High credibility.

Nuclear morphology

An analysis of the nuclei was performed to assess morphological properties. The two-color mask library was used, as it provided a universal representation of the detected nuclei (with U-Net detector models that have good coverage of the nuclei region). Nuclear morphology was assessed using several metrics, including area, perimeter, moments, convexity, and aspect ratio. Convexity is the ratio of convex hull perimeter to perimeter, which provides a size-neutral measure of boundary regularity. The convex hull is a polygon that connects the outer edges of nuclei like an envelope.

### Cortical thickness systematically varies with curvature and depth in healthy human brains [^4c04d438]. Human Brain Mapping (2022). Medium credibility.

2.4.2 Mean curvature

Unlike Gaussian curvature, mean curvature is an extrinsic property of the surface, providing a useful measure of foldedness. It has an intuitive meaning, changing as a piece of paper is folded into a cone or cylinder. Just like paper folding, the extent of shape change might be restricted by intrinsic properties of the surface, such as its initial thickness and surface area (Mota & Herculano‐Houzel). The direction of the outward unit normal provides the orientation at a given point, so that the mean curvature distinguished between convex and concave shapes. It has previously been shown to be a good indicator of gyral and sulcal patterns of the cortex (Batchelor et al; Cachia et al; Luders et al.). For discrete surfaces, the mean curvaturecan be calculated bywhereis the number of edges connected to the vertex; denotes the length of the i th edge connected to the vertex; is the dihedral angle, or the angle between normal vectors of the adjacent triangles meeting at the edge; andis the sum of the areas of the adjacent triangles (Mesmoudi et al.) (Figure 6). This formulation assumes that the neighboring vertices of the polygon is a cylindrical arc with a small radius tangent to adjacent edges.

2.4.3 Principal curvatures

At a given point on a curved surface, there are two orthogonal planes that correspond to the maximum and minimum normal curvatures, and, respectively. (Here we use the convention, but note that some studies instead use.) The principal curvatures are quantified as the reciprocal of the radius of the circle of best fit tangent to the surface at that point. The local shape of a point on an arbitrary surface can be determined by principle curvatures (Figure 7). They can be calculated from the mean and Gaussian curvature asand) (Gray,) or conversely, the mean and Gaussian curvature can be written in terms of principal curvatures asand, respectively. In this study, we calculated the principal curvatures from the values of mean and Gaussian curvature at each vertex (Hu et al.).

### A universal state and its relaxation mechanisms of long-range interacting polygons [^59dbff00]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

The length scale a is the average particle distance. f numerical simulations of squares (φ = 17.6) and triangles (φ = 15) illustrate that the states are shape dependent at a low cut-off distance but shape-independent at a high cut-off distance. Upper panels: square particles produce a square lattice at low cut-off distance R C = 3 (the unit of R C is the disc particle's diameter, i.e. 6 mm); while a hexagonal state appears at high cut-off distance R C = 6. Lower panels: triangle particles exhibit a glassy state at R C = 3 but a hexagonal state at R C = 6. g square and triangle particle's phase diagrams from simulations. At large enough R C, a hexagonal state universally appears. The lower-left blank area is the region at and below the jamming point, where the system starts to unjam and fall apart

Among all three groups, the high-symmetry group behaves almost identical to discs which is well understood. Therefore our study mainly focuses on the intermediate and low symmetry situations, represented by the square and triangle systems, respectively. We directly visualize their high-density ordered state in Fig. 1b, c, with all particle centers connected for a better illustration: clearly the hexagonal crystalline symmetry universally appears in both systems. However, because the orientations of polygons are not identical, this structure is actually a hexagonal plastic crystal. As the rotational symmetry is lowered, the triangular particles tend to produce more 5–7 pair dislocations (labeled in red in Fig. 1c), which make the system more disordered with |Ψ 6 | values smaller than squares. In Fig. 1d, e we plot the 2D Fourier transform of particle centers, which once again confirms a nice hexagonal symmetry in both systems.

### Mechanical control of neural plate folding by apical domain alteration [^f1afa5a9]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

2D vertex model

Each cell in the 2D vertex model is a polygon. The evolution of the system follows the friction-dominated equation of motion for the polygon verticeswhereis the position of vertex, is the viscosity of the vertices, indicates the gradient relative to the position of the-th vertex, andis the (dimensionful) energy of the tissue. We use the usual area-and-perimeter-elasticity energy function:

Here, andare the area and perimeter, respectively, of cell, andare respectively its target area and perimeter, whereasandare respectively the area and perimeter elasticity moduli. To recast the equation in dimensionless form, we divide this energy by, where we assume that the target area of all cells is identical. This results in the main text Equation, with the definitions,… The equation of motions then becomeswhereis the dimensionless position of the-th vertex, the overdot indicates the derivative with respect to the dimensionless time (measured in units of), and the gradient is now with respect to the dimensionless position of vertex.

The initial condition of our model is a regular hexagonal lattice withandcells along theandaxis, respectively. In the model neural plate region, every second row contains an extra cell along theaxis, so that the region is symmetrical relative to the AP axis. The outermost cells of the entire model tissue cannot change shape, enforcing fixed boundary conditions. The resulting equations of motion are solved using an explicit Euler scheme, with time step, and model tissues are shown at time(in the case of thetissue shown in Fig. S5 e, f, we useddue to the computational intensity of simulating a model tissue of that size, and the tissue is shown atas the greater number of cells means it takes longer for it to relax). Note that our model does not allow for T1 transitions and the model tissue is therefore always a hexagonal lattice in terms of cell neighbor relations.

### Comparing accuracies of length-type geographic atrophy growth rate metrics using atrophy-front growth modeling [^3d2eb435]. Ophthalmology Science (2022). Medium credibility.

It is interesting to note that the square-root-transformed metrics tend to overestimate the growth rate, whereas the perimeter-adjusted growth rates tend to underestimate the growth rate. The overestimation of square-root-transformed metrics can be understood as a consequence of the inverse proportionality to the square root of circularity (equation 2) and thedependency on focality (equation 3). The underestimation of the perimeter-adjusted growth rates can be understood as a consequence of lesion merging, which censors GA growth (Appendix 3) and anisotropic growth fields, which, as mentioned, increase the follow-up lesion's perimeter-to-area ratio.

Considering the scatterplots of Figure 5, we see that with increasing follow-up intervals, a trend of improving accuracy for the effective radius metric and a worsening accuracy for the perimeter adjusted metric emerges. The latter is expected and can be understood as a consequence of increased lesion merging (see, for example, merging at the longer intervals in Fig 6). The former is somewhat less expected, but can be understood as a consequence of the increasing circularity and decreasing focality of follow-up lesions in the large growth limit; that is, the follow-up lesions tend to look more like (unifocal) circles at longer follow-up intervals (Fig 6). Moreover, because the follow-up lesions have substantially more area than the baseline lesions, they dominate the contribution of the baseline lesion areas in the difference of square-root-of-areas computation (equation 1). However, an important caveat to this trend is that, in clinically observed GA growth patterns, we expect to see the formation of new lesion foci during the follow-up interval, the probability of which increases with longer follow-up intervals. Such new foci formation would tend to decrease the accuracy of the square-root-transformed metrics. Notably, new foci formation was not modeled in our simulations, a limitation discussed later.

### Topological dual and extended relations between networks of clathrate hydrates and frank-kasper phases [^5161ebba]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Results

Basic building blocks

Conventionally, the crystalline clathrate hydrates structures are described by the combination of elementary cages as listed in Supplementary Table S1, mindful that numerical descriptions cannot express the steric connectivities. Through careful deconstruction of the H-bond network of clathrate hydrates, we replaced the well-established elementary cages description to define one common building block that is identified in all crystal structures discussed in this work: 5 12 cage with two hexagonal rings. As shown in Fig. 2 a, the two hexagonal rings lie in the same plane and each share an edge with the 5 12 cage. The line connecting the center of the hexagonal rings passes through the center of the 5 12 cage, and it will be called centerline. We summarize three primitive connectivities of this basic building block (BBB) in crystalline clathrate hydrates, as shown in Fig 2 c: (PC1) two BBBs are connected via a node in the hexagonal rings (a water molecule) and their centerline are perpendicular; (PC2) BBBs are connected by sharing hexagonal rings, meanwhile their 5 12 cages merge through pentagonal faces, which leads to an equilateral triangle building block; (PC3) the arrangement of the 5 12 cage is the same as in PC2, while their centerlines are parallel. Following these three primitive connectivities, other more complex building blocks can be derived to assemble diverse crystalline H-bonded networks. The network extends exclusively following the PC1 forming a cube building block (CBD, Fig. 2 d). The 2D tiling of the equilateral triangle building block has six-fold symmetry, which is represented by a rhombic block (R-A, Fig. 2 f); similarly, PC3 derives another type of rhombic block (R-B, Fig. 2 g). Moreover, the PC2 interlaced in 3D forms a pyramid building block (Fig. 2 e) — a detail structure is shown in Supplementary Fig. 4.

### Mono-planar T-Hex: speed and flexibility for high-resolution 3D imaging [^d0089922]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Towards greater flexibility of segmentation, a key parameter is the PE increment d of each individual shot, which is the spacing of readout lines in EPI and the radial increment per turn for a spiral readout. For conventional segmentation, d is constrained to integer multiples of the lattice constant Δk as shown in Figure 1A. However, other distances occur on the hexagonal grid as illustrated in Figure 1B. Defining the hexagonal grid by the basis vectorsand, a greater variety of vector lengths results from forming integer combinations ofand:

Due to the symmetries of the grid, all possible distances are represented by vectors from the origin to points in the first dodecant marked yellow in Figure 1B (M 1 ≥ M 2 ≥ 0).

This greater choice of distances can be exploited to increase the flexibility of segmentation by selecting a grid point with favorable distance d from the origin (eg, M 1 = 2, M 2 = 1, marked red in Figure 1B) and tilting the grid such that the corresponding vectoris orthogonal to the principal axis of the stack (2nd PE axis in Figure 1C). For all choices of, the points on the tilted hexagonal grid fall onto a finer, rectilinear grid (green lines in Figure 1D), as derived in the Appendix of Ref.

For optimal imaging performance, the eventual sampling density must account for the required FOV and the parallel imaging capability of the array used. Either or both may be anisotropic, calling for different densities in the two PE directions. To implement these, the tilted hexagonal pattern is rescaled in the two dimensions and cropped according to the desired resolution.

### Predicting visual function by interpreting a neuronal wiring diagram [^10e54a65]. Nature (2024). Excellent credibility.

Ellipse approximation to 'receptive fields'

Suppose that an image has hexel valuesat Cartesian coordinates, where i runs from 1 to N points of a hexagonal lattice. Normalizing the image yields a probability distribution. Then compute the coordinates of the image centroid byand the covariance matrix byin which I denotes the 2 × 2 identity matrix and s denotes the length of a hexagon side. The length and width of the hexel image are defined asand, in whichandare the larger and smaller eigenvalues of the covariance matrix. The approximating ellipse is centred at the image centroid, and oriented along the principal eigenvector of the covariance matrix.

The first term of the covariance matrix C effectively regards the probability distribution as a weighted combination of Dirac delta functions located at the lattice points. The second term is a correction that arises if each delta function is replaced by a uniform distribution over the corresponding hexagon. This replacement makes biological sense because a column receives visual input from a non-zero solid angle. Without the correction, the length and width would vanish if the image consists of a single hexel concentrated at a single delta function. With the correction, the length and width of an image with a single non-zero hexel become, in whichis the lattice constant. The correction becomes relatively minor when the length and width of the image are large.

The above has implicitly definedas the width of a 1D Gaussian distribution, for whichis the variance. This is the full-width atof the maximum. Alternatively, the width could be estimated by the full-width at half-maximum. For either estimate, the width is proportional to. I stick with the simpler estimate, which can be readily scaled by any multiplicative factor of the reader's preference.

### Versatile kit of robust nanoshapes self-assembling from RNA and DNA modules [^8eeab1b0]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Isolation and characterization of nanoshapes

The kinetic and thermodynamic stability of the RNA-DNA-11 assemblies was demonstrated by extraction of individual bands from a gel and re-analysis by PAGE showing stable single bands (Fig. 2a). Gel purification provided pure samples of individual RNA-DNA-11 assemblies for imaging by atomic force microscopy (AFM). In agreement with PAGE analysis including RNA size marker, AFM imaging of the RNA-DNA-11 combination revealed a mixture of clean polygonal nanoshapes, ranging from triangles to hexagons, devoid of larger aggregates (Fig. 2b, Supplementary Fig. 6). Perimeter analysis of nanoshapes observed by AFM revealed discrete peaks representing polygon classes, from triangles to hexagons (Fig. 2c). The peak spacing at multiples of 8 nm corresponds to the side length of polygons assembled from RNA corner modules that are connected by a DNA-11 insert. Each side of these nanoshapes contains a total of 31 bp, including 8 bp of RNA-RNA double strand combined in the two corner modules, 11 bp of DNA-DNA in the DNA-11 insert and 12 bp of RNA-DNA hybrid combined in the two overlapping regions between insert and corners (Supplementary Figs. 1, 2). The polygon side length of 8 nm as measured by AFM suggests that all bp in the nanoshape sides adopt the A form conformation with a characteristic rise/bp of 0.26 nm, amounting to a predicted length of 8.1 nm for a helix of 31 bp.

### Evaluation of foveal avascular zone after strabismic and anisometropic amblyopia therapy in Saudi children using optic coherence tomography angiography: a cohort study [^781af975]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

High-resolution OCTA images depicting depth-resolved retinal vasculature were acquired using an OCTA instrument. Advanced segmentation techniques then isolate the retinal layers and distinguish blood vessels from the surrounding tissue. The algorithm then detects and delineates the borders of the FAZ, identifying the central avascular area of the macula that lacks perfused capillaries. With the FAZ outlined, the software measures the number of pixels within the defined region and converts this into a physical area in units such as square millimeters. Additionally, the circularity of the FAZ was calculated by analyzing its shape contours. Through this automated sequence, the proprietary algorithm developed by the company enabled reliable and validated quantification of clinically relevant FAZ metrics (Figure 1). Although the specific details of their software are proprietary, the general workflow demonstrates an optimized approach for precise FAZ analysis.

Figure 1
Foveal Avascular Zone (FAZ) Parameters in Amblyopic and Nonamblyopic Eyes at Study Onset and Final Follow-Up. The presented graph depicts the FAZ area (in mm 2), perimeter (in mm), and circularity in the amblyopic eye in comparison with the nonamblyopic fellow eye at the beginning and conclusion of the study. It is noteworthy that no significant discrepancies were detected between the amblyopic and nonamblyopic eyes in terms of the FAZ parameters at either time point. However, minor reductions in the FAZ perimeter were observed in the amblyopic eye throughout the study.

The SCP layer is a thin layer of tissue that lies between the internal limiting membrane and outer border of the inner plexiform layer in the eye. The ratio of the perimeter of the FAZ to that of a circle with an equal area, which ranges from 0 to 1, was used to determine the circularity of the FAZ. A value closer to 1 indicated a more regular circular shape. We assumed that the circularity of the FAZ at baseline was 0.7 ± 0.1 in the eye with amblyopia, and four months after amblyopia treatment, it was 0.8 ± 0.12, as reported by Huang et al. We ensured high-quality scan with an experienced technician trained by the OCTA company. The built-in software automatically rejected scans if the artifacts affected the interpretation of the scan results. The FAZ area was measured and corrected for the magnification factor due to variations in axial length using the formula:

### Pore configuration landscape of granular crystallization [^b2d1eb3b]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

It is notable that a Delaunay tetrahedron generates a point in the PD 2 plot only when its circumcentre lies inside its four triangular faces. Such a tetrahedron is called 'well-centred'. The birth value is the largest circumradius of the four faces and the death value is the circumradius of the tetrahedron. Circumradii of the triangular faces, ρ i, and of the tetrahedron, R, are related by ρ i = R sin(γ i) where γ i is the angle between the outward-pointing normal to face i and a radial line drawn from the tetrahedron circumcentre to one of the vertices on face i. The angles γ i can take any value in (0, π) so ρ i ∈(0, R), with ρ i = R when γ i = π /2 (and so have birth = death in PD 2). For a tetrahedron to be well-centred, however, we must have γ i < π /2 for all four faces. But the largest angle in any given tetrahedron must be greater than that for a regular tetrahedron, so. This means the circumradii of the faces of a well-centred tetrahedron satisfy ρ i ∈(R sin(γ max), R sin(π /2)), that is, ρ i / R ∈(/3, 1). This is quite a narrow strip in the persistence diagram PD 2 (/3 = 0.9428), and implies that any point (b, d) in PD 2 with d > 3 b /must be due to a 'pore' built from two or more Delaunay tetrahedra (that is, five or more beads in the bead-pack data).

Our bead packs are weakly polydisperse, and the variation in bead radii is compensated for by using the weighted DT (also known as a regular triangulation) based on the power distance to a ball B (z, r): d B (x) = d (x, z) 2 − r 2. The definition of alpha shapes carries over naturally to this setting.

### Quantitative morphological variation in the developingWing [^3ed6547e]. G3 (2018). Low credibility.

Scalar measures

The standardized distances between the 28 possible pairwise combinations of the 8 landmarks were obtained from the Cartesian coordinates of the landmarks standardized by the centroid size. Centroid size is proportional to the square root of wing area. In addition, we measured the standardized lengths for a portion of the anterior margin using landmarks 1–3 and semi-landmarks 9–14, and for a portion of the posterior margin using landmarks 5–7 and semi-landmarks 15–17 (Figure S1).

Three areas were calculated using the surveyor's formula for calculating areas of polygons. The first area was obtained by calculating the area of the regular polygon within the landmarks 1–4 and semi-landmarks 9–14, thus obtaining a proxy of the anterior wing area ('Anterior'). The second areas is for the polygon defined by the landmarks 3–6 which contains the region within the longitudinal veins L3 and L4 ('Middle'). The third area is the one of the regular polygon defined by landmarks 5–8 and semi-landmarks 15–17, and gives a proxy of the posterior wing area ('Posterior') (Figure S1).

Standardized lengths and areas were compared between developmental stages and between genotypes by calculating means ratios. Values of variance for these ratios were obtained by bootstrapping the data. For example, change in the standardized length between landmarks 2 and 8 (stlen28) during the larval to pupal transition in the yw genotype was calculated with the following procedure: individual values for stlen28 in the yw pupal wings population were re-sampled with replacement a number of times equal to the number of individuals in the population. The mean on the re-sampled data were calculated and divided by the mean obtained by the same approach on the yw larval wing population. This procedure was repeated 1000 times providing thus a distribution of values for the ratio of stlen28 (pupa) / stlen28(larva) of the yw genotype. Scalar measures were computed and plotted using R version 3.3.0.

Measurements "are performed using geometric test probes, such as points (0D), lines (1D), planes (2D), or volumes (3D)". These probes create countable events in the image, and "Raw counts provide ratios… that are multiplied by the reference space volume to obtain absolute measures for the lung or subcompartment".

### Emergent geometry and duality in the carbon nucleus [^66b35170]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

The carbon atom provides the backbone for the complex organic chemistry composing the building blocks of life. The physics of the carbon nucleus in its predominant isotope, 12 C, is similarly full of multifaceted complexity. Here we provide a model-independent density map of the geometry of the nuclear states of 12 C using the ab initio framework of nuclear lattice effective field theory. We find that the well-known but enigmatic Hoyle state is composed of a "bent-arm" or obtuse triangular arrangement of alpha clusters. We identify all of the low-lying nuclear states of 12 C as having an intrinsic shape composed of three alpha clusters forming either an equilateral triangle or an obtuse triangle. The states with the equilateral triangle formation also have a dual description in terms of particle-hole excitations in the mean-field picture.

### Nuclear morphology is a deep learning biomarker of cellular senescence [^562f9815]. Nature Aging (2022). High credibility.

Senescent cells display altered nuclear morphology

The morphology of the detected nuclei was analyzed to compare senescent cells to controls. There was a significant difference in nuclear area as previously reported. Notably, IR senescent cells were also significantly larger than RS cells (Fig. 1c). Aging and certain premature aging diseases have been associated with greater irregularities or folds in the nuclear envelope. We therefore evaluated the regularity of the nuclear envelope using convexity, a ratio of convex hull perimeter to perimeter. Convexity indicated that control cells were more regular compared to both IR and RS (Fig. 1d), and RS had the highest irregularity. This finding suggests convexity is another measure of senescence, with lower values corresponding to increased senescence. In addition, we found that both IR and RS had higher aspect ratios compared to control (Fig. 1e). We evaluated area and convexity per nuclei, observing overlapping clusters for the three states with area of RS overlapping both control and IR and convexity of RS and IR overlapping (Fig. 1f). Interestingly, the distribution of area for the IR senescent cells was bimodal, with the lower mode matching RS and a higher mode at almost twice the area, perhaps suggesting IR induced aneuploidy or stalling at the G2 checkpoint of the cell cycle. To further explore this hypothesis, we induced senescence with multiple IR doses and used flow cytometry to study the cell cycle. Remarkably, we observed a dose-dependent increase in G2 and corresponding loss of G1 and S-phase cells 10 days after the IR treatment (Fig. 1g and Extended Data Fig. 1m), indicating that IR induction leads to G2-stalled senescent cells as previously suggested. Simple nuclear morphological measures appear to be a viable method for assessing cellular senescence in culture.

Our work is different from previous work, where the connecting direction was normal to the regular polyhedrons; instead, we determine the connecting direction by bridging the centroids of the deformed polyhedrons in the template. We obtain the length of the connectionbetween the adjacent shrunken polyhedrons:

### Endoscopic image-based prediction of esophageal stenosis after ESD using mucosal defect metrics [^aff7d224]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

Measurement of Mucosal Defect Area, Perimeter, and Circumferential Ratio

The area and perimeter of the specimens were measured using the Image Pro Plus 6.0 program (MediaCybernetics, Silver Spring, MD, USA), as shown in Fig. 1 A–C. The circumferential ratio of mucosal defects was estimated by reviewing the documented ratio of the lesion in the operation record. Circumferential or near circumferential defects are denoted as "1". Defects that cover half of the circumference are denoted as "0.5", those that cover two-thirds are denoted as "0.67", and so forth (values equal to or less than one-fifth of the circumference were consistently recorded as "0.2"). The Image Pro Plus 6.0 program was utilized to measure the area and perimeter of the mucosal defect within the near-circumferential defect, where the mucosal bridge was preserved during ESD. For a circumferential defect where the mucosal bridge was not preserved, the area was calculated by area = circumference × longitudinal length. Since the mucosa obtained from a circumferential resection was cylindrical, calculating the circumference of the upper and lower sides could not accurately reflect its larger resection area. Therefore, these cases were not included in the perimeter statistics. The assessment of MPI during ESD procedure was conducted using the MPI scale.(grade 0: no defected injury, class i: injury without full perforation, and grade p: injury with full perforation). MPI and the presence or absence of mucosal bridges during ESD were converted into categorical variables (absence denoted as 0, presence denoted as 1, both MPI-i and MPI-p denoted as 1).

### Geographic atrophy growth is strongly related to lesion perimeter: unifying effects of lesion area, number, and circularity on growth [^00c837ce]. Ophthalmology: Retina (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To investigate the underlying reason for the previously observed impact of baseline lesion size, number, and circularity on geographic atrophy (GA) growth rate.

Design

Retrospective analysis of a multicenter, prospective, randomized controlled trial.

Participants

Age-Related Eye Disease Study participants with GA secondary to nonexudative age-related macular degeneration.

Methods

We manually delineated atrophic lesions on color fundus photographs of 318 eyes with GA followed up over at least 2 visits (mean follow-up duration, 5.1 ± 3.0 years). We calculated GA area growth rate for each eye based on the first and last visit. GA perimeter-adjusted growth rate was defined as the ratio between GA area growth rate and mean GA perimeter between the first and last visit for each eye.

Main Outcome Measures

GA area growth rate, growth rate of the square root of GA area, and GA perimeter-adjusted growth rate.

Results

GA area growth rate was correlated strongly with mean GA perimeter (r 2 = 0.66). GA area growth rate was associated with baseline GA area (r 2 = 0.39; P < 0.001), lesion number (r 2 = 0.10; P < 0.001), and circularity index (r 2 = 0.28; P < 0.001). The use of the square root of GA area reduced the influence of baseline GA area (but not lesion number or circularity) on GA growth rate. In comparison, GA perimeter-adjusted growth rate (0.098 ± 0.062 mm/year) was not correlated with baseline GA area (r 2 = 0.005; P = 0.20), lesion number (r 2 = 0.00009; P = 0.86), or circularity index (r 2 = 0.007; P = 0.14). GA perimeter-adjusted growth rate was 50.0% higher in eyes whose fellow eyes showed GA at any visit (0.102 ± 0.062 mm/year) than in eyes whose fellow eyes never demonstrated GA during follow-up (0.068 ± 0.049 mm/year).

Conclusions

The growth rate of GA area is associated strongly with lesion perimeter. This relationship explains the previously observed influences of baseline GA size, lesion number, and circularity on GA growth rate. GA perimeter-adjusted growth rate is uncorrelated with the 3 morphologic factors and may serve as a surrogate outcome measure to monitor GA progression in future studies.

### Age-related deficits in mobility resilience with an extreme weather and climate event [^84c40aa0]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

The ratio of recovery is the daily mobility at a new equilibrium after reaching the prehurricane average level (M Equilibrium) to the average daily mobility in the week before the forming of the hurricane (M 0). The posthurricane mobility equilibrium is determined when the variance of daily mobility is equal to or lower than the average variance of daily mobility in the 7 days before the forming of the hurricane (detailed in the eMethods in Supplement 1): ratio of recovery = M Equilibrium / M 0.

The ratio of impact is the maximal daily loss in mobility during the hurricane (I) to the average daily mobility in the week before the forming of the hurricane (M 0), where I = M 0 − M Low (M Low being the lowest daily mobility during the hurricane): ratio of impact = I / M 0 = (M 0 − M Low) / M 0.

The area of the resilience triangle is calculated as the sum of the percentages of daily mobility loss compared with M 0 across the days between the start day of the hurricane's impact (D Start) to the day when mobility returned to the prehurricane average level (D Recover):

If the daily mobility could not return to the prehurricane level, we determined the end of the triangle as the day when daily mobility achieved a new equilibrium (D Equilibrium). The ratio of recovery and ratio of impact in these neighborhoods were calculated the same way as previously described, while the area of the resilience triangle was calculated as the sum of the percentage of daily mobility loss compared with M 0 across the days between D Low and D Equilibrium. We found that only 4 of the 1819 studied neighborhoods did not recover to their prehurricane mobility level.

Additional details regarding the social infrastructure–related points of interest, mobility (geolocation) datasets, and the techniques for detecting the resilience triangle are described in the eMethods and eFigure 1 in Supplement 1. Statistics of the resilience metrics pertaining to mobility are presented in eFigure 2 and eTables 1 and 2 in Supplement 1.

### Shaping micro-clusters via inverse jamming and topographic close-packing of microbombs [^7662020f]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Programming the degrees of freedom in topographic clusters

Empirically, the final clusters can be programmed by the number of seeds (N = 1, 2, 3,…) and the number of vertices of the well (V = 0, 3, 4, 5, and 6 for circles, triangles, squares, pentagons, and hexagons, respectively) providing topographic confinement. As shown in Fig. 5a, we analyzed over 2000 clusters. In the confinement of N = 1, single-cell particles could be created by filling the microwell, imitating the shape of the confinement. For N > 1, the differentiated cleavages were symmetric when k = V / N yielded an integer k, i.e. (V, N) = (0, 2), (0, 3), (3, 3), (4, 2), (6, 2), and (6, 3). Otherwise, clusters with random microbomb assembly were observed. Regarding the orientation of the constituent cells, the (6, 2) combination, for example, could program two types of symmetric clusters: one with a cleavage wall normal to one of the 6 edges where the interior angle of a unit is 3 π (marked as a black line), and the other containing two isosceles trapezoids (internal angle is 2 π) shares the space diagonally (marked as a blue line). In addition, it is important to note that since there are no predictable cues for the cleavage orientation in the case of the singularity (V = 0), the perfect programming of clusters (100%) for all cases of N is warranted from the non-pinning mobility in confinement. The SEM images in Fig. 5b, c reveal the hollow nature of the clusters from a triangular prism (Fig. 5b) and a cube with a cleavage connecting four cells (Fig. 5c) after focused ion beam (FIB) milling. At room temperature, the shell became glassy again, and thus the microbombs could maintain the packed shape permanently.

### Regionalized tissue fluidization is required for epithelial gap closure during insect gastrulation [^93d57933]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Shape index analysis

Shape index was calculated for each segmented cell in the 2D cartographic projections aswhere P is the cell perimeter and A is the cross-sectional area. The measurements were distortion-corrected using the above-mentioned Fiji plugins and plotted onto the segmented cartographic projection as a color map. The local cell shape alignment index Q was calculated as described recently. Briefly, cells in each map projection were converted into a triangular mesh connecting the centers of all adjacent segmented cells, i.e. where three (or more) cells touch, a triangle (or a triangle fan) with vertices coinciding with centers of adjacent cells was formed. For every triangle, a degree q of deviation from equilateral triangle was computed. For every cell, its shape alignment index Q became a weighted average over q from all triangles whose vertex coincides with this cell's center. Using this Q, an adjusted shape index threshold was determined as p adj = p 0 + 4 bQ 2 for p 0 = 3.94 and b = 0.43. According to Wang et al. simulations of this threshold marks solid-to-fluid transition for a given anisotropy in the tissue (i.e. for a given value of cell shape alignment index Q). The tissue fluidity for a given cell was then calculated as a difference between its actual shape index p and p adj for a given local value of Q. This difference was converted into a color code and displayed on each cartographic projection. Green color signifies solid-like local tissue properties (p < p adj), brown color fluid-like local tissue properties (p > p adj), and black color marks the vicinity to the theoretically predicted solid-to-fluid transition (p = p adj).

### A general method for the creation of dilational surfaces [^6025b588]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Dilational structures can change in size without changing their shape. Current dilational designs are only suitable for specific shapes or curvatures and often require parts of the structure to move perpendicular to the dilational surface, thereby occupying part of the enclosed volume. Here, we present a general method for creating dilational structures from arbitrary surfaces (2-manifolds with or without boundary), where all motions are tangent to the described surface. The method consists of triangulating the target curved surface and replacing each of the triangular faces by pantograph mechanisms according to a tiling algorithm that avoids collisions between neighboring pantographs. Following this algorithm, any surface can be made to mechanically dilate and could, theoretically, scale from the fully expanded configuration down to a single point. We illustrate the method with three examples of increasing complexity and varying Gaussian curvature.

### Mono-planar T-Hex: speed and flexibility for high-resolution 3D imaging [^94f77b72]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

2 METHODS

2.1 Trajectory design

2.1.1 Tilted hexagonal grids

Fast 3D Fourier encoding is often achieved by stacking identical 2D readouts in the third dimension. EPI and Archimedean spirals then form 2D Cartesian grids in planes orthogonal to the read direction. These planes, which are parallel for EPI and radial about the principal axis of the stack for spirals, shall be referred to as phase‐encoding (PE) planes. However, Cartesian sampling is usuallly suboptimal. Structures with approximately circular or elliptical support are sampled more efficiently on hexagonal grids. In parallel imaging with undersampling, the greater isotropy of hexagonal patterns improves the conditioning of image reconstruction for a given mean sampling density.,

Spiral and EPI trajectories can readily be stacked in such a way that they cover hexagonal grids in their PE planes (Figure 1A). However, due to the finite feasible length of individual readouts, one shot may not suffice to cover an entire nominal k‐space plane when targeting high resolution. The common solution to this problem is to segment each plane into N interleaved shots. However, due to the inflexibility in time allocation arising from N being an integer, it is often impossible to optimize the sequence timing for contrast and SNR as discussed more closely in the Supporting Information.

### Polygonal non-wetting droplets on microtextured surfaces [^39b281e0]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Understanding the interactions between liquids and solids is important for many areas of science and technology. Microtextured surfaces have been extensively studied in microfluidics, DNA technologies, and micro-manufacturing. For these applications, the ability to precisely control the shape, size and location of the liquid via textured surfaces is of particular importance for the design of fluidic-based systems. However, this has been passively realized in the wetting state thanks to the pinning of the contact line, leaving the non-wetting counterpart challenging due to the low liquid affinity. In this work, confinement is imposed on droplets located on well-designed shapes and arrangements of microtextured surfaces. An active way to shape non-wetting water and liquid metal droplets into various polygons ranging from triangles, squares, rectangles, to hexagons is developed. The results suggest that energy barriers in different directions account for the movement of the contact lines and the formation of polygonal shapes. By characterizing the curvature of the liquid-vapour meniscus, the morphology of the droplet is correlated to its volume, thickness, and contact angle. The developed liquid-based patterning strategy under active regulation with low adhesion looks promising for low-cost micromanufacturing technology, DNA microarrays, and digital lab-on-a-chip.

### Collective self-caging of active filaments in virtual confinement [^e5ed295e]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Table 1
Simulation parameters corresponding to the data shown in the main text (unless specified otherwise)

For sufficiently large U 0 and d, filaments experience strong repulsive forces that prevent overlaps and thus reproduce a strictly 2D confinement. Decreasing either of these two parameters, we observe crossing between filaments similar to those reported in the experiments (see Fig. 1 d). Lowering U 0 at fixed d = σ /2 for the filament density used in our simulations, this transition quickly leads to a vanishing of the interactions between filaments, leading to structureless aggregates in the illuminated region. On the other hand, decreasing d at fixed U 0 allows for a larger intermediate regime where filaments can cross each other while still effectively aligning nematically when their density reaches large enough values. As discussed in the main text and shown in Fig. 3, this regime where 0.15 ≲ d / σ ≲ 0.35 precisely corresponds to the emergence of nontrivial patterns at the illumination boundary.

The data presented in Fig. 2 d was obtained by varying the radius of the illuminated disk in the range [5 σ; 80 σ] while keeping the system size fixed. In Fig. 4, we illustrate various geometries with the following specifications: ellipse with major and minor radii of 55 σ and 40 σ, respectively (a), ellipse with major and minor radii of 66 σ and 15 σ, respectively (b), square of side length 50 σ (c), trapezoid with height 55 σ, length of the first base 124 σ, and of the second base 62 σ (d), equilateral triangle with height 80 σ (e), and a teardrop made from one equilateral triangle with height 80 σ and a semicircle with radius 23 σ (f).

### Human V4 size predicts crowding distance [^d250125a]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Relationship between A and λ

We quantified the relationship between A, cortical map surface area, and λ, number of letters in the uncrowded visual field, in two ways. First, we computed the correlation (Pearson's r) and covariance between the two variables. These calculations treat the two variables symmetrically. We visualize the covariance ellipses at 1-SD and 2-SD, scaling the x and y axes so that one standard deviation of each variable is the same length (Fig. 3a). This ensures that the covariance ellipses are circular when the correlation is 0. Second, to explicitly test for conservation, we fit a linear model to A (independent variable) and λ (dependent variable), with the intercept set to 0, and asked how much of the variance in λ is explained (Fig. 3c). Note that the variance explained can be negative, because a line through the origin may be a worse predictor (larger residuals in λ) than just assuming the mean (a horizontal line). For both the correlation coefficient and the variance explained, 68% confidence intervals were calculated by bootstrapping participants with replacement (n = 10000).

The relationship between A and λ depends on how we compute λ. We measured radial but not tangential crowding distance, so we estimated the tangential crowding distance by assuming that all participants have the same fixed 2:1 ratio of radial to tangential crowding, based on mean values reported by Kurzawski et al.and Toet and Levi. We simulated two cases to estimate how much this assumption affects our estimates of λ. In one case, we assigned each participant a ratio of radial to tangential crowding drawn from a Gaussian distribution with a 2:1 mean and the standard deviation reported by Kurzawski et al. In the other case, everyone was assigned the same 2:1, with zero variance. The change in variance only slightly changed estimates of λ. The estimates of λ in the two cases are 88% correlated. If we treat this discrepancy as measurement noise, correcting for it {} would slightly increase the estimated underlying correlation r between λ and V4 A, from 0.65 to 0.74. The point is just that the measured correlation depends only weakly on the variance of the radial-to-tangential ratio.

### An innovative method for nasal alar reduction surgery based on the equilateral triangle design theory [^be1dd641]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

At present, there is no unified and accurate method to design the amount of tissue to be removed in alar reduction surgery. The authors present the experience that the crescent-shaped alar resection is based on the innovative equilateral triangle theory. It can accurately estimates the amount of alar tissue to be removed and conforms to the 3-dimensional esthetic concept of the nose. Followed up for 6 to 12 months, took 6 and 12 months postoperative photos, measured the postoperative nasal base width, and conduct a questionnaire satisfaction survey. The width of the nasal base was reduced by an average of 4.4 ± 2.1 mm. The mean visual analog scale score showed: 4.8 ± 1.6 before operation and 7.6 ± 1.2 after the operation (P < 0.05), which revealed satisfactory patient outcomes. This method provides a new idea for the evaluation of nasal alar resection volume and is worthy of clinical application.

### The self-overlap method for assessment of lung nodule morphology in chest CT [^891c9e21]. Journal of Digital Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

Surface morphology is an important indicator of malignant potential for solid-type lung nodules detected at CT, but is difficult to assess subjectively. Automated methods for morphology assessment have previously been described using a common measure of nodule shape, representative of the broad class of existing methods, termed area-to-perimeter-length ratio (APR). APR is static and thus highly susceptible to alterations by random noise and artifacts in image acquisition. We introduce and analyze the self-overlap (SO) method as a dynamic automated morphology detection scheme. SO measures the degree of change of nodule masks upon Gaussian blurring. We hypothesized that this new metric would afford equally high accuracy and superior precision than APR. Application of the two methods to a set of 119 patient lung nodules and a set of simulation nodules showed our approach to be slightly more accurate and on the order of ten times as precise, respectively. The dynamic quality of this new automated metric renders it less sensitive to image noise and artifacts than APR, and as such, SO is a potentially useful measure of cancer risk for solid-type lung nodules detected on CT.

### Optogenetic control of apical constriction induces synthetic morphogenesis in mammalian tissues [^23e118f1]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Translocation measurement

For the analysis of translocation, 2 × 10 5 MDCK cells were seeded on a 12 mm-diameter glass (113 cells/mm 2). Samples were stimulated 2 days after seeding as described in live imaging methods. Translocation measurements were carried out with FIJI using apical slices of MDCK cells. A 0.362 μm 2 area (5 × 5 pixels) of the junctional or cytoplasmic region was manually selected and averaged for every time point. Three areas for each type (junction or cytoplasm) were selected on every image. For the junction/cytoplasm ratio, each junction measurement was divided by the closest cytoplasm measurement.

Sample preparation for 3D segmentation

For the analysis cell shape, 2 × 10 5 MDCK cells were seeded on a 12 mm-diameter glass (113 cells/mm 2). Samples were stimulated 2 days after seeding as described in live imaging methods. For Shroom3 measurements, a stable GFP-CAAX and doxycycline-inducible mCherry clonal cell lines were mixed at 5% ratio with a GFP-CAAX stable cell line. Samples were induced with 0.5 μg/ml 24 h before the measurement. For WT-control measurements, only the GFP-CAAX stable cell line was used.

Curvature measurement

Local curvature was defined as the inverse of the radius of the osculating circle to three points of a curve. Curvature was measured by calculating the osculating circle of three equally distanced points (20 pixels distance) in the skeleton, equivalent to calculating the inverse of the radius of a circumscribed circle around a triangle:Being R the radius of the osculating circle of points A, B, and C. AB, BC, and CA are the distance between the points. K is the area of the triangle formed by A, B, and C. Local curvatures were measured along the skeleton of the main axis and averaged for every time point to obtain a general curvature measurement.

For neuroectodermal organoids, SspB-mCherry-CShroom3 slices were segmented. Curvature measurements were applied to the perimeter of the segmented organoids. In this case, distance between points was set up higher (320 pixels) to filter out curvatures caused by very small features, such as delaminating cells.

### Universality in long-distance geometry and quantum complexity [^7fa0611b]. Nature (2023). Excellent credibility.

More generally, we can imagine adjusting this criterion in various directions. For example, we could require that a and c are not independent of n but have a mild n dependence. In the Supplementary Information, we mention a boundthat was proved in the context of nilpotent Lie groups of the formwhere 0 < α < 1. This implies that the fractional error vanishes at large d at a rate no slower than d α −1. This is a stronger statement than equation (22) if c is left unspecified, but it is a slightly weaker statement than equation (22) if it requires c = 1.

In the context of discrete groups, an elementary result is that the coarse geometry defined by the Cayley graph is independent of the choice of generating set. That is, we can consider a group G that is generated by some set of easy elements g 1,…, g k. The distance from the identity to some group element g is the minimum length of the word formed from g 1,…, g k that expresses g. Although the metric depends on the choice of generating set (or more generally, the penalty factors associated with each group element), the claim is that different choices of generating sets give distance functions that satisfy equation (22). Furthermore, we can consider properties of the geometry that depend on only the equivalence class. A particularly interesting property is δ -hyperbolicity, which is a notion of negative curvature that applies even in this discrete context. We can identify negative curvature by observing that all triangles in negatively curved spaces are slim — that is, any point on one side of the triangle is close to some point on another side of the triangle, with the maximum separation set by the curvature scale. This property defines what is known as Gromov hyperbolic groupsand is the subject of ongoing mathematical work. A simple example is a free group, where the Cayley graph is an infinite tree. This notion of negative curvature may explain our conjecture that the critical metric has negative sectional curvatures. In particular, the notion of δ -hyperbolicity shows that the concept of large-scale curvature is not a contradiction. In the context of Lie groups, we expect that although many members of a given equivalence class exhibit extreme local curvatures, their large-scale curvatures (for example, that probed by large triangles) should approximately agree with the large-scale curvatures of the critical metric.

### Strain and morphological changes of median nerve after carpal tunnel release [^ca39fa5f]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Objectives

Characterization of the changes of ultrasound parameters after carpal tunnel release may be useful for clarifying the effectiveness or the recovery process of the carpal tunnel syndrome treatment. We evaluated strain and morphological changes of the median nerve before and after carpal tunnel release in carpal tunnel syndrome patients.

Methods

Twenty-two wrists of 20 idiopathic carpal tunnel syndrome patients who underwent open carpal tunnel release were evaluated by ultrasound. Cross-sectional images of the median nerve were obtained at the proximal carpal tunnel. The cross-sectional area, perimeter, aspect ratio of the minimum enclosing rectangle, and strain of the median nerve were measured and compared before and after carpal tunnel release. According to the patient's recovery, the areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) were compared among the parameters.

Results

After carpal tunnel release, the area and perimeter significantly decreased, and the strain significantly increased compared with before carpal tunnel release. There were no significant changes in the aspect ratio after carpal tunnel release. The AUCs were 0.663, 0.643, 0.543, and 0.731 for the area, perimeter, aspect ratio, and strain, respectively.

Conclusions

Significant decreases in median nerve area and perimeter as well as significant increases in median nerve strain were observed after carpal tunnel release. The results of this study may be useful when considering how the median nerve recovers after carpal tunnel release.

### Comparison of oblique triangular configuration and inverted equilateral triangular configuration of three cannulated screws in treating unstable femoral neck fracture: a finite element analysis [^4d515c26]. Injury (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The cross-sectional area of three parallel screws might affect the stability of the internal fixation of femoral neck fractures. The screws fixed in the oblique-triangle configuration (OTC) were assumed to have a larger cross-sectional area, but the biomechanical stability has not yet been validated. In this study, finite element analyses were performed to compare the biomechanical properties of the internal fixation fixed by the OTC and the traditional Inverted Equilateral Triangle Configuration (IETC).

Method

Pauwels type III fracture was established on the three-dimensional femoral model and three cannulated screws with the OTC and traditional IETC methods were applied. The oblique-triangle configuration with the largest area inscribed the femoral neck isthmus by the three screws was determined, the area and circumference of the cross-section formed by the OTC and IETC model were compared. Stress, strain, and displacement peaks of the two configuration models under different loads were compared. Twelve pairs of nodes on the fracture ends were selected and the displacement of the fracture ends was evaluated through the displacement between these nodes.

Results

The area and circumference of the cross-section formed by the OTC were larger than those in the IETC model. The degree of stress dispersion around the screw holes in the OTC model was better than that of the IETC, but the stress distribution order of the three screws in the two models was consistent. The maximum stress, strain, displacement, and displacement of the fracture end in the OTC model were smaller than those in the IETC model. The stress, strain, displacement, and fracture end displacement peaks of the two fixed models gradually increase with the increase of loads.

Conclusion

The oblique-triangle configuration showed superior mechanical properties than the IETC in finite element analyses. This study suggests that when three screws are fixed in parallel method, the larger the cross-sectional area of the screw configuration, the better stability of the internal fixation might be obtained. Furthermore, the biomechanical properties of various spatial configurations and screw holes of the three parallel screws need to be considered before clinical practice.

### Buckling cluster-based H-bonded icosahedral capsules and their propagation to a robust zeolite-like supramolecular framework [^ceca30e9]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Crystalline cluster-based H-bonded icosahedral assembly

Inspection of the rhombic dodecahedral crystal habit in the case of 1 is unexpected among crystalline forms of coinage metallic clusters, which is evocative of an example of icosahedral viruses crystallized into cubic crystals in a similar dodecahedral shape. This inspire us to conjecture that extraordinary arrangement and packing of cluster tectons might exist. To our delight, the most attractive structural feature of 1 is that twelve molecular copper clusters per unit cell self-assemble into an enclosed approximately icosahedral capsule denoted as Cu 60 (Fig. 1d) with an approximate diameter of 3.0 nm. The surface of the pseudo icosahedron contains two types of triangular faces (Fig. 1e): 8 equilateral triangles and 12 isosceles triangles, each equilateral triangle with side lengths of 16 Å (the centroid-centroid distances of two adjacent clusters) and each isosceles triangle with side and base lengths of 16 and 13 Å, respectively. It is worth noting that this is the only possible combinatorial outcome for the pseudo icosahedron buckled from these equilateral triangles and isosceles triangles, based on the ChatGPT prediction. The internal hollow icosahedral capsule Cu 60 could accommodate a sphere with a diameter of about 25 Å, corresponding to a sphere volume of ~8177 Å. Our observation of the supramolecular icosahedral assembly that involves solid-state aggregation of individual clusters is intriguing. It was previously reported that atomically precise metal nanoclusters functionalized with capsid-targeting ligands which were used to label specific components of the surface of enteroviruses created icosahedral arrangement of clusters. But once the absence of capsid-targeting ligands and without linking to the viral surfaces, cluster-based icosahedra are difficult to achieve. More importantly, the atomically accurate cluster-based icosahedral capsule will provide much more detailed information for further identifying the possible assembled origin of the icosahedron as the largest of the Platonic solids.

### Comparing accuracies of length-type geographic atrophy growth rate metrics using atrophy-front growth modeling [^d6cf3a30]. Ophthalmology Science (2022). Medium credibility.

Simulations with Simplified Lesion Geometries and Growth Fields

Figure 2 illustrates a hierarchy of simplified, simulated lesion geometries and growths whose rows are arranged according to focality and whose columns are arranged according to a subjective complexity of lesion geometry and growth pattern. All lesions of Figure 2 were constructed to correspond to Δ t = 1 year follow-up intervals to have equal baseline areas of A (t b) = 6 mm 2 and to have equal length-type growth rates of Λ = 0.1 mm/year, the latter of which approximately corresponds to the reported mean of the 1-year perimeter adjusted growth rates of the AREDS dataset. Mathematical specifications of the lesion geometries and growth fields are given in Appendix 5. Using the terminology of Table 1, configurations 1 through 3 represent a progression of geometric complexity, moving from a circle (configuration 1) to an ellipse (configuration 2) to a notched shape (configuration 3). Relevant to growth rate estimation, configurations 1 and 2 both are convex shapes, and therefore isotropic growth never results in intrafocus merging (Appendix 3); however, configuration 2 is noncircular (i.e. has a circularity index of < 1), and therefore results in errors when assessed using square-root-transformed metrics (equation 2). Configuration 3 has a nonconvex geometry, and therefore, lesion growth can lead to intrafocus merging, which has the effect of censoring GA growth, making growth estimation ill-posed for any metric (Appendix 3). Compared with configurations 1 through 3, configuration 4 corresponds to an anisotropic growth field, which causes the baseline circular lesion to grow into a more complex, nonconvex geometry. In the second row, although the baseline lesion shapes are all circular, bifocality results in estimation errors when using square-root-transformed metrics (equation 3). Configurations 5 and 6 correspond to different distributions of lesion area between the foci. Configuration 7 corresponds to an anisotropic growth field, constructed so that the lesion growth rate of each lesion focus is constant, but with the rate of the top left lesion being half that of the bottom right lesion. Finally, unlike configurations 5 through 7, configuration 8 involves merging of the 2 lesion foci (i.e. interfoci merging). Evaluations of metric accuracy were performed by scaling the growth fields (but not the baseline lesion geometries) so as to vary Λ through a range of 0.05 to 0.7 mm/year (Appendix 5).

### Apical conicity ratio: a new index on left ventricular apical geometry after myocardial infarction [^c30b61af]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

Our objective was to introduce a new index to evaluate left ventricular aneurysm by quantitative analysis of left ventricular apical geometry.

Methods

A total of 116 selected subjects underwent magnetic resonance imaging, 28 healthy volunteers, 29 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, and 59 patients with ischemic heart disease (26 with left ventricular aneurysm; 33 with no aneurysm). The apical conicity ratio was calculated as the ratio of left ventricular apical area over apical triangle.

Results

Diastolic apical conicity ratio of patients with left ventricular aneurysm was 1.62 ± 0.20 and systolic apical conicity ratio was 1.78 ± 0.43. After left ventricular reconstruction, the diastolic apical conicity ratio decreased to 1.47 ± 0.23 and the systolic ratio to 1.51 ± 0.21, which came close to the normal level, whereas other global indices remained. In patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, sphericity index and eccentricity index increased significantly without changes in the apical conicity ratio. Among patients with ischemic heart disease, the apical conicity ratio of the group with left ventricular aneurysm was significantly higher than that of the group without an aneurysm when the other indices between the 2 groups showed no statistically difference. Receiver operating characteristic curves showed only apical conicity ratio had high power of discriminating left ventricular aneurysm from no aneurysm.

Conclusions

The new index, apical conicity ratio, can be used to quantify the regional left ventricular deformation, especially in patients with left ventricular aneurysm resulting from myocardial infarction.

### Subicular neurons encode concave and convex geometries [^5593e5fe]. Nature (2024). Excellent credibility.

Animals in the natural world constantly encounter geometrically complex landscapes. Successful navigation requires that they understand geometric features of these landscapes, including boundaries, landmarks, corners and curved areas, all of which collectively define the geometry of the environment 1–12. Crucial to the reconstruction of the geometric layout of natural environments are concave and convex features, such as corners and protrusions. However, the neural substrates that could underlie the perception of concavity and convexity in the environment remain elusive. Here we show that the dorsal subiculum contains neurons that encode corners across environmental geometries in an allocentric reference frame. Using longitudinal calcium imaging in freely behaving mice, we find that corner cells tune their activity to reflect the geometric properties of corners, including corner angles, wall height and the degree of wall intersection. A separate population of subicular neurons encode convex corners of both larger environments and discrete objects. Both corner cells are non-overlapping with the population of subicular neurons that encode environmental boundaries. Furthermore, corner cells that encode concave or convex corners generalize their activity such that they respond, respectively, to concave or convex curvatures within an environment. Together, our findings suggest that the subiculum contains the geometric information needed to reconstruct the shape and layout of naturalistic spatial environments.

### Polygonal non-wetting droplets on microtextured surfaces [^db22327a]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Design of silicon micropillar arrays and operations

A schematic representation of the experimental setup is given in Fig. 1a. It consisted of a z -axis translation stage on the bottom and a superhydrophobic glass plate (treated with a commercial coating agent, Glaco Mirror Coat "Zero", Soft 99, Co.), on the top (Supplementary Method 1, Supplementary Fig. 1). As shown in the first row of each panel (Fig. 1b–d), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) illustrated well-defined shapes of silicon micropillar arrays fabricated by standard contact photolithography and deep-reactive ion etching. These microtextured surfaces can be categorized into three groups. First, cross-sectional areas of the pillars based on triangular, circular, and square were arranged in square arrays, respectively (Fig. 1b). Second, the triangular cross-sections of the pillars were arranged in triangular arrays (Fig. 1c). Third, cross-sections of the pillars based on triangular, square, hexagonal, and circular were arranged in hexagonal arrays, respectively (Fig. 1d). Note that a refers to the typical length scale of the cross-sectional area of a pillar, i.e. the side length of the triangular and square pillars, the diameter of the cylindrical pillars, and the diagonal length of the hexagonal pillars (Supplementary Fig. 2). Also, the side length of the triangular and square pillars was set to a = 20 μm, side length of the hexagonal pillars was a = 10 μm, and diameter of the cylindrical pillars was a = 20 μm. The minimum spacing of the pillars was denoted as b = 10 μm and the pillar height was h = 90 μm (Supplementary Method 2, Supplementary Table 1). All samples were first coated by a silane film CF 3 (CF 2) 9 CH 2 CH 2 SiCl 3 (FDDTS) deposited by RPX-540 of Integrated Surface Technologies, Inc. Afterward, the surface of each pillar became hydrophobic with the Young contact angle θ 0 = 110 ± 5°. Each sample was cleaned before the experiments. By placing water (Fig. 1b–d) and liquid metal (Galinstan, Fig. 1e) droplets in a confinement consisting of a microtextured surface on the bottom and a superhydrophobic glass surface on the top, polygonal-shaped droplets were formed by narrowing the separation of the two surfaces. The top-view visualization of the droplet by a CCD camera (Canon 550D, Hi-Scope advanced KH3000) and separation H of the two surfaces by length sensor (Heidenhain-Metro 2581) were recorded simultaneously. The details of the microfabrication, silanization, sample-cleaning procedure, contact angle measurements, and experimental process are all provided in the Methods section.

### Selective directed self-assembly of coexisting morphologies using block copolymer blends [^216275c6]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

Image analysis

We quantify order in the BCP patterns using image analysis of SEM data, as previously described in the literature. We used code written in the Python programming language, exploiting libraries for image manipulation (Python Image Library), numerical computations (numpy)and plotting (matplotlib). For dot patterns, image thresholding and segmentation is used to identify the cylinder cores. The local topology of the hexagonal lattice is assessed by connecting cylinder cores to nearest neighbours, using a cutoff distance of 1.36 × the average cylinder–cylinder distance (that is, halfway between the first and second 'rings' of cylinders surrounding a representative cylinder). For each cylinder, the number of neighbours (number of cylinders within the cutoff distance) is calculated. Using this nearest-neighbour map, defects can be identified by cylinders that deviate from the ideal state of having six nearest neighbours (regions where a cylinder is 'missing' are surrounded by cylinders of five nearest neighbours, distortions of the hex lattice lead to local configurations where the nearest-neighbour count is larger or smaller than six, and so on). The areal defect density is computed by dividing the defect count by the image size (cylinders at the periphery of the image are ignored, since they lack the correct nearest-neighbour count owing to the image edge). For line patterns, image thresholding and segmentation is used to identify the endpoints of individual lines. Endpoints (other than at the image edge) correspond to local defects in the morphology. The trend of the areal defect densities provides a robust measure of the relative ordering quality of different samples. The relative areal coverage of line patterns (F L) versus dot patterns was assessed using particle counting. A thresholded image was used to identify 'particles' within the image, and a size cutoff was used to distinguish between regions of dots (small particles) and lines (large, elongated particles). The spacing between rows of aligned BCP morphology was assessed by summing pixel grayscale intensity values in each column in the SEM image. Images were first Fourier-filtered to suppress imaging noise, and rotated to align the experimental patterns with the pixel grid. Columns were summed to yield a one-dimensional oscillating curve. Peak-fitting (Gaussian fit constrained to a local part of the curve) was used to identify the positions of local maxima; distances between adjacent maxima were used to measure the local pattern spacing (Δ x).

### Comparing accuracies of length-type geographic atrophy growth rate metrics using atrophy-front growth modeling [^53dbc2ff]. Ophthalmology Science (2022). Medium credibility.

Observing that GA lesions tend to enlarge along their margins, researchers proposed the perimeter-adjusted growth rate metric, as an extension of the effective radius growth rate to more general, noncircular geometries:

Conveniently, this metric has been well studied in the computer-aided geometric design community in the context of offset curves. It can be shownthat for isotropic, time-invariant growth fields, = Λ for lesions having concave curvatures whose absolute values are small relative to the lesion growth (an illustration of concave and convex margin segments, as well as the precise definition of small, is provided in Appendix 3 and Figure S1). Briefly and informally, a concave margin segment corresponds to an inward bulge in the lesion, and a convex margin segment corresponds to an outward bulge in the lesion). Intuitively, this condition requires that no intrafocus merging occurs. Of note, = Λ for any convex lesion undergoing isotropic, time-invariant growth (a lesion is convex if the entirety of its margin is convex, that is, the lesion has no inward bulges; for example, ellipse-shaped lesions are convex).

Although the above results demonstrate the usefulness of the atrophy-front growth model for interpreting length-type growth rate metrics, they pertain to simplistic geometries and growth patterns. Analysis of arbitrary geometries and growth patterns, for which analytical results are unwieldy or intractable, can be approached numerically, which is the focus of the subsequent section.

Generating Datasets for Numerical Evaluation of Metric Accuracy

Compared with clinically observed GA data, for which the complete growth dynamics are not well understood, simulated GA data have the advantage that the true growth parameters can be precisely specified. Importantly, an observed data set comprising images of a GA lesion acquired at a sequence of follow-up visits does not provide direct information related to the underlying growth field; different growth fields can result in the same observed growth data. This ambiguity is particularly acute for common clinical datasets, for which the intervisit times are relatively lengthy (e.g. 6 months or longer). Because of these challenges, we outline below our growth simulation approach, and then we construct a set of highly simplified lesion geometries and growth fields that highlight inherent limitations of the square-root-transformed and perimeter-adjusted metrics. Finally, we present a semisimulated approach to generating realistic GA growth configurations using real lesion geometries and simulated random growth fields.

### Comparing accuracies of length-type geographic atrophy growth rate metrics using atrophy-front growth modeling [^d30272cf]. Ophthalmology Science (2022). Medium credibility.

Results

Figure 3 shows the effective radiusand the perimeter-adjustedmetrics plotted against the ground truth growth ratesfor each of the configurations of Figure 2. We can see that, as was analytically derived in the Methods, the perimeter adjusted growth rateis a perfect estimator of Λ for isotropic, nonmerging growth patterns (configurations 1, 2, 5, 6, and 7). We also see that, even for configurations violating these requirements (configurations 3, 4, and 8), performs at or near the pixel resolution of the simulation grid (± 6 μm; Appendix 5) for most clinically observed growth rates. In comparison, the effective radius metricperforms relatively poorly for all but the simplest configuration (configuration 1), for which it was designed. Specifically, the effective radius metric is affected by circularity (equation 2), number of lesion foci (equation 3), and lesion merging.

Atrioventricular (AV) valves morphometric evaluation — measurement of mitral valve (MV) and tricuspid valve (TV) size helps characterize valvar pathology and diagnose ventricular hypoplasia, with annular diameter and area measured by 2D and 3D imaging; annular area may also be estimated from a single-plane diameter using the area formula for a circle, but because the MV annulus is elliptical and saddle-like in shape a more accurate estimate can be obtained with orthogonal diameters using the area formula for an ellipse, and published pediatric normative databases have used annular diameters measured in apical 4-chamber (lateral diameter) and parasternal long-axis (anteroposterior diameter) views to calculate MV and TV elliptical annular areas.

### Imaging the structure of the trimer systems (4) He3 and (3) He (4) He2 [^1f6f9de3]. Nature Communications (2014). Medium credibility.

Helium shows fascinating quantum phenomena unseen in any other element. In its liquid phase, it is the only known superfluid. The smallest aggregates of helium, the dimer (He2) and the trimer (He3) are, in their predicted structure, unique natural quantum objects. While one might intuitively expect the structure of (4)He3 to be an equilateral triangle, a manifold of predictions on its shape have yielded an ongoing dispute for more than 20 years. These predictions range from (4)He3 being mainly linear to being mainly an equilateral triangle. Here we show experimental images of the wave functions of (4)He3 and (3)He(4)He2 obtained by Coulomb explosion imaging of mass-selected clusters. We propose that (4)He3 is a structureless random cloud and that (3)He(4)He2 exists as a quantum halo state.

### Endoscopic image-based prediction of esophageal stenosis after ESD using mucosal defect metrics [^3c3ddfee]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

ROC Curve Analysis and Establishment and Validation of Nomogram Model

The dataset was partitioned into a training set and a validation set using a random allocation ratio of 7:3. There were no statistically significant disparities observed in the circumferential ratio, area, perimeter of mucosal defect, and intraoperative MPI between the two groups (all P > 0.05). Owing to collinearity between the mucosal defect's area and perimeter, we analyzed these separately along with the circumferential ratio and intraoperative MPI. We then developed a nomogram model from the training set to predict the risk of postESD esophageal stenosis. In the training set, the C-statistic of perimeter and area was 0.875 and 0.830, while in the validation set it was 0.747 and 0.835, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 1–2). The Hosmer–Lemeshow GOF test yielded nonsignificant results in both the training set (χ 2 = 10.576 and 10.721, respectively) and the test set (χ 2 = 7.001 and 6.958, respectively) (P > 0.05). This suggested that the prediction model demonstrated excellent discrimination and calibration. When the mucosal defect area reached 1200–1250 mm 2 and the perimeter was 55–60 mm, the prediction score was approximately equal to that of the mucosal defect at 3/4 esophageal circumference (Supplementary Fig. 3; Supplementary Fig. 4). When the cumulative score reaches 70, there is a high probability (> 50%) of esophageal stenosis.

### The genetic basis of apple shape and size unraveled by digital phenotyping [^a8fe2b6b]. G3 (2024). Medium credibility.

Feature extraction for shape and size

From the apple fruit contours obtained from FruitPhenoBox, 1D features for shape and size were systematically processed (Table 1, Fig. 1b). For the points on the fruit contour defined in polar coordinates (Pol), the distance of the point from the center of the coordinate system, i.e. the radius, was used in feature extraction. The points in the Cartesian coordinate system were expressed as individual coordinates for both axes (X measuring fruit diameter and Y measuring fruit length). Different fruit sections were determined as the top (A), bottom (B), left (L), or right (R) half of the fruit, as well as intersections of the fruit halves, i.e. fruit quarters (A.L, A.R, B.L, B.R) and unions of the halves, i.e. the full fruit (AB, LR). Points from the fruit contour derived in Cartesian and polar coordinates within a chosen fruit section were used to calculate different types of features, namely the mean (Av), the standard deviation (SD), the minimum (Min), or maximum (Max) value, the 0.25, 0.50, or 0.75 quartile (Q25, Q50, Q75), the area, the ratio between Max and Min value (RatM), and the Max value relative to the Av value (MaxR). The area was calculated by summing up 1°-radius increments in the specified section. For each type of feature, the absolute value (Abs) was taken from the features extracted on different sections. For the opposite fruit halves, absolute values were first extracted and then the ratio (Rat) and the sum (Sum) were calculated across the fruit halves. The ratio or the sum of top vs bottom halves was calculated as average (Rat. Av and Sum. Av) and SD (Rat.SD and Sum.SD). Hereby, the top and bottom halves were calculated from quarter values using the corresponding left–right fruit quarters (AB.LR). Additionally, symmetry between L and R as well as A and B was calculated as the Av or SD of the difference between corresponding absolute values of radius of each fruit half (Sym.abs, sections LR, and AB). Similarly, the symmetry measure Sym.abs was obtained for individual apple sections A, B, L, and R when comparing the opposite quarters within the fruit halves. Additionally, a relative symmetry (Sym.rel) was derived for the same apple sections as Sym.abs, but the measure Sym.rel was normalized for the area of the apple section.

It is measured in four-chamber apical view, at end-systole, on the frame just prior to mitral valve opening by tracing the LA inner border, excluding the area under the mitral valve annulus and the inlet of the pulmonary veins. It is described as more representative of actual LA size than anteroposterior diameter only, but requires a dedicated view to avoid LA foreshortening and assumes a symmetric shape of the atrium.

### A general patterning approach by manipulating the evolution of two-dimensional liquid foams [^7ec00d8c]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

To prepare perfect hexagonal arrays of larger bubbles, increases in the side length of the hexagonal cells result in the increases in the pillar interval, which leads to the formation of defects. An alternative method is to increase the number of silicon pillars on each side (denoted as N) when increase the side length (denoted as l). As shown in Fig. 2c, the pillar interval a equals l /(N −1). For the same side length l, more pillars on each side N correspond to a smaller the pillar interval a, and an increased occurrence of the reverse Ostwald ripening phenomenon. This deduction agrees well with the experiments exhibited in Fig. 2d. The squares on the map mean that N is large and a /2 will be small and less than ρ; thus, only reverse Ostwald ripening happens, eventually forming perfect hexagonal bubble arrays. The crosses in the map suggest that N is small and a /2 will be much larger than ρ; thus, only the defect formation will happen. The triangles show that if N is not too large, a /2 will be slightly more than ρ, and some bubbles shows the reverse Ostwald ripening (Fig. 2a) and others exhibits the defect formation (Fig. 2b). The coexistence of reverse Ostwald ripening and defect formation leads to the formation of partly hexagonal bubble arrays (Supplementary Fig. 4b). The least number of silicon pillars on each side and the corresponding maximum pillar interval for preparing perfect bubble arrays of different side length were summarized in Fig. 2e. With the increase of side length, the N min increases significantly for rejecting the increase of pillar interval. Therefore the maximum pillar interval only increases slightly. The allowed maximum pillar interval, a max, can be considered 2 ρ because both are the allowed maximum pillar interval for forming perfect bubble arrays, that is, a /2 ≤ a max /2≈ ρ.

### Guidelines for performing a comprehensive transesophageal echocardiographic examination: recommendations from the American Society of Echocardiography and the Society of Cardiovascular Anesthesiologists [^6c7856d5]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2013). Medium credibility.

Mitral valve anatomy and annulus measurement — 2D versus 3D assessment: The MV complex is composed of the annulus, the leaflets (anterior and posterior), chordae tendineae, and papillary muscles, and unlike the TV, the MV is in direct continuity with the AV complex; the native mitral annulus is D shaped, is nonplanar, and its area changes during the cardiac cycle with fibrous trigones medially and laterally. Traditional 2D imaging uses a "view-based" approach with four-chamber and two-chamber windows, and the ASE guidelines advocate using a single four-chamber view to measure the annular diameter in mid-diastole and then calculating the annular area using the formula of a circle, but this is noted as an oversimplification; more accurate assessment has been proposed using correct anatomic LAX and commissural planes with an elliptical formula to estimate annular area, identifying the highest point of the mitral leaflet in LAX, and using simultaneous multiplane imaging or 3D volume reconstruction, which correlate with in vitro and in vivo models, while direct 3D planimetry of annular area may be more accurate but is not validated.

### American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists, American college of endocrinology, and associazione medici endocrinologi medical guidelines for clinical practice for the diagnosis and management of thyroid nodules – 2016 update [^abb642ca]. Endocrine Practice (2016). Medium credibility.

Thyroid nodule margins and shape — assessment rules and specific features: "Nodule shape and margins should be assessed as independent features", recognizing that "an irregularly shaped nodule may have well-defined margins". "In large nodules (diameter > 4 cm), accurate assessment of the profile and regularity of margins may be difficult". "The presence of ill-defined margins is suspicious for malignancy", but definition matters: "Nodule margins are ill-defined when they lack clear demarcation from the surrounding perinodular tissue for most (> 50%) of their perimeter". Notably, "ill-defined but round margins are often observed in benign nodules and should not be viewed as suspicious", whereas "spiculated margins — even when well-demarcated from surrounding thyroid parenchyma — are a highly specific sign of malignancy".

### Morphometric analysis of the inferior alveolar nerve fails to demonstrate sexual dimorphism [^9c27303c]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose

With regard to the incidence of inferior alveolar nerve (IAN) damage after an IAN block or following oral and maxillofacial surgical procedures, there are reports of sexual dimorphism, no sexual dimorphism, and little sexual dimorphism. However, details of the morphology and sexual dimorphism in the characteristics of the IAN have not been available in textbooks. We morphometrically analyzed the human IAN and clarified these issues.

Materials and Methods

The materials were obtained from 22 cadavers (11 female and 11 male), aged 59 to 84 years (average age: 74.1 yr), and dentulous. The causes of death did not influence the nervous system, so the IANs were considered to be normal. Human IANs were resected at the mandibular foramen. We counted the myelinated axons and measured the transverse area, perimeter, and circularity ratio of the myelinated axons.

Results

We estimated the average total number of myelinated axons in the female IAN to be 25,230, with an average transverse area of 34.1 microm(2), an average perimeter of 21.8 microm, and an average circularity ratio of 0.86, with the same measurements in the male IAN being 20,278, 31.7 microm(2), 20.7 microm, and 0.87, respectively. Our data showed no significant difference between the female and male specimens in any measured item (P < .05).

Conclusions

We assumed that the sex difference in the incidence of IAN damage was not affected by the morphometric findings. Our findings might partly explain why there is no significant sex difference in the incidence of IAN damage.

### Simple spatial scaling rules behind complex cities [^23b5e063]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Spatial scaling

Our simple rules produce the AP, road network, and socioeconomic interaction distributions (see Fig. 1b, c). The AP distribution and its morphology are in good agreement with the real city of Greater London (see Fig. 1d).

The model allows us to quantify these predictions. According to the SA mechanism, when t is sufficiently large the spatial distribution of AP is approximatelywhere ρ (r, t) is the average density at distance r from the city centre, i.e. the seed node at position (0, 0), R (t) is the radius of the entire city at time t (see Fig. 2b and further details of the explicit form of ρ (r, t) are in Supplementary Note 1), and β is a parameter derived from C. The dependence of β on C (see Fig. 2a) can be derived by the non-linear fitting, and the simulation results are shown in Fig. 2b. Figure 2c shows that the collected data validate Eq. (4). The AP in the real data is defined as a mixture of working and residential populations according to their active duration in that region (see Methods). In the downtown area (i.e. when r / R (t) → 0), the AP density decays following the power law shown in Eq. (4) (see Fig. 2c). In contrast, residential population density decays exponentially as we move from city centre to urban fringe, as verified in previous researchand our data (see Supplementary Fig. 8). This reconciles the conflict between area-size allometry and the exponential decay of population from city centre to urban fringe found in the literature. To eliminate the influence of noise in the empirical data and allow an unbiased comparison of different quantities, we study the cumulative quantities in terms of the distance from the central area instead of the local density (see Fig. 3). Integrating Eq. (4) we obtainwhere P (r, t) is the cumulative AP within the concentric circle of the central area with radius r (see Supplementary Note 3 and Supplementary Fig. 7 for detailed derivations). This expression is approximately a power law with an exponent 2 − β when. This is consistent with the fractal city hypothesis, and the fractal dimension is 2 − β if the distributions of APs and buildings are similar. We can similarly calculate the cumulative road length and socioeconomic interactions asandTherefore the exponents of the cumulative length of the road network and socioeconomic interactions within the circle of radius r are 2 − β /2 and 2 − 3 β /2. These predictions are consistent with the data from Beijing and London shown in Fig. 3. Due to the need for high-resolution data, we use nighttime light as the proxy for socioeconomic interactions –. Although nighttime light data has some intrinsic disadvantages when representing high-resolution interactions (e.g. at a community level, because luminosity is also associated with road density and type of land use), it remains the best candidate among open-source data. We show that as long as the spatial resolution is not excessively high it is a good proxy (see Methods, Supplementary Figs. 10 and 12–14 and Supplementary Note 6 for further discussion). Thus based on Eqs. (5)–(7) we can obtain all the other spatial scaling exponents from any single observation.
