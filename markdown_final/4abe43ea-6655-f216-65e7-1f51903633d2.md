## Question

What is the impact of vaccination status on hospitalization rates after previous Covid infection?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how vaccination status affects hospitalization risk after a previous COVID-19 infection. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical frame and the key exposure groups to compare. Then, I should verify the highest-quality evidence on hybrid versus natural immunity. Next, I will examine waning and variant effects, especially Delta and Omicron. After that, I should review booster effects and timing. I will then consider special populations and confounding, and finally synthesize practical recommendations with appropriate caveats and citations.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame and the groups that matter most: people with prior infection who remain unvaccinated, those with prior infection who get vaccinated (hybrid immunity), and, for context, those without prior infection who are vaccinated or unvaccinated. I need to ensure I'm focusing on hospitalization as the outcome rather than infection alone, because infection estimates are more vulnerable to testing and ascertainment bias than hospitalization or death outcomes [^31177a59] [^69b6c999].

> Next, I should review the highest-quality comparative evidence. The Israeli Nature Communications analysis of 2.4 million individuals during Delta predominance found that, compared with non-recent two-dose vaccine immunity, infection-induced immunity reduced hospitalization by 66%, while boosted vaccine immunity reduced it by 89%, and enhanced infection-induced immunity (prior infection plus a single BNT162b2 dose) reduced it by 75% [^a02db504]. Wait, let me verify the magnitude of hybrid benefit: yes, a single dose after infection provided a substantial additional reduction beyond natural immunity alone, though still less than a booster in that study period [^a02db504].

> I will now examine large-scale cohort data that separate prior infection and vaccination status. The California/New York MMWR analysis showed that, after Delta became predominant, hospitalization rates were markedly lower in those with prior infection, and even lower in those with prior infection plus vaccination, relative to unvaccinated without prior infection; importantly, infection-derived protection appeared relatively stronger during Delta, coinciding with waning of vaccine-induced immunity in many recipients [^c2c61f65] [^99920d61]. Hold on, I should verify the timing and variant context: yes, these data span May–November 2021, largely pre-Omicron, which explains the relatively favorable performance of infection-induced immunity in that window [^c2c61f65].

> Let me consider waning and variant effects more explicitly. During Omicron, absolute protection against hospitalization declined for all groups, but relative advantages persisted. COVID-NET data from January–April 2022 showed hospitalization rates were about 10.5 times higher in unvaccinated versus boosted individuals, and about 2.5 times higher in vaccinated without boosters versus boosted, indicating that boosters restored protection even as Omicron eroded two-dose effectiveness [^426aca2a] [^5b4365a0]. I should double-check that these comparisons are population-level and age-adjusted where possible; yes, COVID-NET provides population-based, age-adjusted rate ratios across 13 states [^426aca2a].

> Now, I need to check booster-specific effectiveness in previously infected people. The CDC test-negative design among adults with prior infection found that a booster dose provided approximately 72.5% additional protection against hospitalization when the prior infection was within 180 days, and about 46.7% when the prior infection was more remote, underscoring that boosting adds meaningful protection on top of natural immunity, albeit with some attenuation over time since infection [^d76c8fec]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought the booster effect was uniformly above 70% regardless of timing; I should correct that: the point estimate drops when the prior infection was more than 180 days earlier, reflecting waning of infection-induced immunity and possibly variant mismatch effects [^d76c8fec].

> Next, I should review special populations and confounding. Older adults, immunocompromised patients, and those with multiple comorbidities have higher baseline hospitalization risk and may mount weaker vaccine responses; thus, even with hybrid immunity, their absolute risk remains higher, and vaccination strategies often include additional doses or pre-exposure prophylaxis in these groups [^ab8b943a] [^633846ac]. I need to ensure I account for the "healthy vaccinee" effect and differential testing/hospitalization thresholds, which can bias nonrandomized estimates; careful matching and test-negative designs mitigate some of this, but residual confounding remains possible in observational studies [^bbefe381] [^69b6c999].

> Let me synthesize the magnitude of benefit. Prior infection alone confers substantial protection against hospitalization, on the order of roughly 66–88% in several large cohorts, but vaccination after infection provides additional protection, typically in the range of about 45–75% relative risk reduction versus natural immunity alone, with the highest protection seen with booster doses and during periods of variant circulation that erode two-dose vaccine effectiveness [^a02db504] [^d76c8fec] [^8d8839f9]. Hold on, I should verify that these ranges align with both Delta-era and Omicron-era data; yes, while absolute risks vary by variant and time since exposure, the relative advantage of hybrid over natural immunity persists across periods, albeit attenuated during Omicron [^426aca2a] [^6f841801].

> I should confirm practical implications and timing. For people with recent prior infection, a single vaccine dose can meaningfully enhance protection, but waiting 2–3 months after infection is reasonable to optimize immunogenicity and avoid conflounding from recent infection; for those with remote infection or during high transmission of immune-evasive variants, staying up to date with recommended boosters provides the most robust protection against hospitalization [^cb252915] [^2ae28d4c]. But wait, what if the person is immunocompromised or otherwise high risk? In that case, earlier vaccination after infection may be appropriate, and additional doses or pre-exposure prophylaxis should be considered per current guidance [^633846ac].

> Finally, I need to ensure the bottom line is clear and clinically actionable. Vaccination after prior COVID-19 infection reduces the risk of subsequent hospitalization beyond natural immunity alone, with the clearest incremental benefit from booster doses; however, absolute risk remains higher in older adults and those with comorbidities, so vaccination status should be integrated with age, comorbidity, and exposure risk to guide counseling and prevention strategies, including consideration of early antivirals if reinfection occurs in high-risk patients [^a02db504] [^d76c8fec] [^2ae28d4c].

---

Vaccination after prior COVID-19 infection provides **additional protection** against hospitalization, with the strongest benefit from booster doses [^a02db504] [^d76c8fec]. Natural immunity alone offers substantial protection, but **waning occurs over time** and varies by variant [^8d8839f9] [^a824198e]. Hybrid immunity (prior infection plus vaccination) **reduces hospitalization risk more than infection alone**, especially during Delta and Omicron waves [^a02db504] [^6f841801]. Booster doses restore protection as immunity wanes, and vaccination remains the safest strategy to prevent severe outcomes [^31177a59] [^2ae28d4c].

---

## Protection from prior infection alone

Natural immunity from prior infection provides **strong protection** against reinfection and hospitalization, but this protection wanes over time and varies by variant [^8d8839f9] [^a824198e]. A large Swedish cohort found that natural immunity reduced reinfection risk by 95% and hospitalization by 87% for up to 20 months, though protection attenuated after 9 months [^8d8839f9]. Similarly, a JAMA Network Open study showed 85% lower risk of reinfection and 88% lower risk of hospitalization in unvaccinated individuals with prior infection compared to those without prior infection [^5e76d174].

---

## Impact of vaccination after prior infection

Vaccination after prior infection **enhances protection** against reinfection and hospitalization, creating hybrid immunity that is more robust and durable than infection alone [^a02db504] [^8d8839f9]. A Nature Communications study found that hybrid immunity reduced hospitalization risk by 75% compared with non-recent two-dose vaccination, and by 66% compared with infection alone [^a02db504]. Another large cohort showed that vaccination after infection reduced reinfection risk by about 50% across populations, including high-risk groups [^741e8bf9] [^6cedc6ff].

## Comparative effectiveness: natural immunity vs. vaccination

| **Immunity type** | **Protection against reinfection** | **Protection against hospitalization** |
|-|-|-|
| Natural immunity (prior infection only) | High initially, wanes over time (≈85–95% initially, declining after 9–12 months) [^8d8839f9] [^5e76d174] | Substantial initially, wanes over time (≈87–88% initially, declining after 9–12 months) [^8d8839f9] [^5e76d174] |
| Vaccination only (no prior infection) | High initially, wanes over time (≈90% initially, declining after 6–12 months) [^a824198e] [^481f8efc] | Strong and durable (≈70–90% against hospitalization, with boosters restoring protection) [^a824198e] [^31177a59] |
| Hybrid immunity (prior infection + vaccination) | Highest and most durable protection (≈95% or higher, persisting beyond 12 months) [^notfound] | Strongest protection (≈75–90% or higher, with boosters maintaining protection) [^a02db504] [^6f841801] |

## Waning of immunity and role of boosters

Both natural and vaccine-induced immunity **wane over time**, especially against emerging variants such as Delta and Omicron [^a824198e] [^e32c2c32]. Booster doses significantly restore protection, particularly against severe outcomes. During Omicron, hospitalization rates were 10.5 times higher in unvaccinated individuals and 2.5 times higher in vaccinated individuals without boosters compared with those who had received boosters [^426aca2a] [^5b4365a0]. Boosters also enhance hybrid immunity, providing sustained protection against hospitalization [^a02db504] [^31177a59].

---

## Variant-specific considerations

Variant circulation **influences the strength** of infection- and vaccine-derived protection. During Delta predominance, infection-derived protection appeared stronger due to waning vaccine immunity, whereas Omicron's immune escape reduced the effectiveness of both natural and vaccine-induced immunity, though hybrid immunity remained superior [^c2c61f65] [^a824198e]. Nonetheless, vaccination continued to provide substantial protection against severe outcomes even during Omicron [^426aca2a] [^6f841801].

---

## Clinical implications and public health recommendations

- **Vaccination after prior infection**: Strongly recommended to enhance and sustain protection against reinfection and hospitalization [^a02db504] [^8d8839f9].
- **Booster doses**: Essential to maintain protection as immunity wanes, especially in the context of emerging variants [^31177a59] [^2ae28d4c].
- **Individualized risk assessment**: Consider age, comorbidities, and timing of prior infection or vaccination when advising on booster timing and additional doses [^2901901c] [^2ae28d4c].

---

Vaccination after prior COVID-19 infection **provides additional protection** against hospitalization, with the strongest benefit from booster doses. Natural immunity alone offers substantial but waning protection, whereas hybrid immunity delivers the most robust and durable defense against severe outcomes.

By November 30, 2021, approximately 130,781 COVID-19-associated deaths, one in six of all U.S. deaths from COVID-19, had occurred in California and New York.* COVID-19 vaccination protects against infection with SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19), associated severe illness, and death (1,2); among those who survive, previous SARS-CoV-2 infection also confers protection against severe outcomes in the event of reinfection (3,4). The relative magnitude and duration of infection- and vaccine-derived protection, alone and together, can guide public health planning and epidemic forecasting. To examine the impact of primary COVID-19 vaccination and previous SARS-CoV-2 infection on COVID-19 incidence and hospitalization rates, statewide testing, surveillance, and COVID-19 immunization data from California and New York (which account for 18% of the U.S. population) were analyzed. Four cohorts of adults aged ≥ 18 years were considered: persons who were 1) unvaccinated with no previous laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis, 2) vaccinated (14 days after completion of a primary COVID-19 vaccination series) with no previous COVID-19 diagnosis, 3) unvaccinated with a previous COVID-19 diagnosis, and 4) vaccinated with a previous COVID-19 diagnosis. Age-adjusted hazard rates of incident laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases in both states were compared among cohorts, and in California, hospitalizations during May 30-November 20, 2021, were also compared. During the study period, COVID-19 incidence in both states was highest among unvaccinated persons without a previous COVID-19 diagnosis compared with that among the other three groups. During the week beginning May 30, 2021, compared with COVID-19 case rates among unvaccinated persons without a previous COVID-19 diagnosis, COVID-19 case rates were 19.9-fold (California) and 18.4-fold (New York) lower among vaccinated persons without a previous diagnosis; 7.2-fold (California) and 9.9-fold lower (New York) among unvaccinated persons with a previous COVID-19 diagnosis; and 9.6-fold (California) and 8.5-fold lower (New York) among vaccinated persons with a previous COVID-19 diagnosis. During the same period, compared with hospitalization rates among unvaccinated persons without a previous COVID-19 diagnosis, hospitalization rates in California followed a similar pattern. These relationships changed after the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant became predominant (i.e., accounted for > 50% of sequenced isolates) in late June and July. By the week beginning October 3, compared with COVID-19 cases rates among unvaccinated persons without a previous COVID-19 diagnosis, case rates among vaccinated persons without a previous COVID-19 diagnosis were 6.2-fold (California) and 4.5-fold (New York) lower; rates were substantially lower among both groups with previous COVID-19 diagnoses, including 29.0-fold (California) and 14.7-fold lower (New York) among unvaccinated persons with a previous diagnosis, and 32.5-fold (California) and 19.8-fold lower (New York) among vaccinated persons with a previous diagnosis of COVID-19. During the same period, compared with hospitalization rates among unvaccinated persons without a previous COVID-19 diagnosis, hospitalization rates in California followed a similar pattern. These results demonstrate that vaccination protects against COVID-19 and related hospitalization, and that surviving a previous infection protects against a reinfection and related hospitalization. Importantly, infection-derived protection was higher after the Delta variant became predominant, a time when vaccine-induced immunity for many persons declined because of immune evasion and immunologic waning (2,5,6). Similar cohort data accounting for booster doses needs to be assessed, as new variants, including Omicron, circulate. Although the epidemiology of COVID-19 might change with the emergence of new variants, vaccination remains the safest strategy to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infections and associated complications; all eligible persons should be up to date with COVID-19 vaccination. Additional recommendations for vaccine doses might be warranted in the future as the virus and immunity levels change.

Vaccination protected against COVID-19 and related hospitalization, and surviving a previous infection protected against a reinfection and related hospitalization during periods of predominantly Alpha and Delta variant transmission, before the emergence of Omicron; evidence suggests decreased protection from both vaccine- and infection-induced immunity against Omicron infections, although additional protection with widespread receipt of booster COVID-19 vaccine doses is expected. Initial infection among unvaccinated persons increases risk for serious illness, hospitalization, long-term sequelae, and death; by November 30, 2021, approximately 130,781 residents of California and New York had died from COVID-19. Thus, vaccination remains the safest and primary strategy to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infections, associated complications, and onward transmission. Primary COVID-19 vaccination, additional doses, and booster doses are recommended by CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices to ensure that all eligible persons are up to date with COVID-19 vaccination, which provides the most robust protection against initial infection, severe illness, hospitalization, long-term sequelae, and death. ** Additional recommendations for vaccine doses might be warranted in the future as the virus and immunity levels change.

Discussion

This analysis integrated laboratory testing, hospitalization surveillance, and immunization registry data in two large states during May–November 2021, before widespread circulation of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant and before most persons had received additional or booster COVID-19 vaccine doses to protect against waning immunity. Rate estimates from the analysis describe different experiences stratified by COVID-19 vaccination status and previous COVID-19 diagnosis and during times when different SARS-CoV-2 variants predominated. Case rates were initially lowest among vaccinated persons without a previous COVID-19 diagnosis; however, after emergence of the Delta variant and over the course of time, incidence increased sharply in this group, but only slightly among both vaccinated and unvaccinated persons with previously diagnosed COVID-19. Across the entire study period, persons with vaccine- and infection-derived immunity had much lower rates of hospitalization compared with those in unvaccinated persons. These results suggest that vaccination protects against COVID-19 and related hospitalization and that surviving a previous infection protects against a reinfection. Importantly, infection-derived protection was greater after the highly transmissible Delta variant became predominant, coinciding with early declining of vaccine-induced immunity in many persons. Similar data accounting for booster doses and as new variants, including Omicron, circulate will need to be assessed.

The understanding and epidemiology of COVID-19 has shifted substantially over time with the emergence and circulation of new SARS-CoV-2 variants, introduction of vaccines, and changing immunity as a result. Similar to the early period of this study, two previous U.S. studies found more protection from vaccination than from previous infection during periods before Delta predominance. As was observed in the present study after July, recent international studies have also demonstrated increased protection in persons with previous infection, with or without vaccination, relative to vaccination alone †††, §§§. This might be due to differential stimulation of the immune response by either exposure type. Whereas French and Israeli population-based studies noted waning protection from previous infection, this was not apparent in the results from this or other large U.K. and U.S. studies **. Further studies are needed to establish duration of protection from previous infection by variant type, severity, and symptomatology, including for the Omicron variant.

### Rates of COVID-19 among unvaccinated adults with prior COVID-19 [^5e76d174]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Discussion

Among 121 615 patients with more than 10 million days of follow-up, unvaccinated individuals with prior symptomatic COVID-19 had 85% lower risk of acquiring COVID-19 than unvaccinated individuals without prior COVID-19. Prior studies investigating protection against SARS-CoV-2 reinfection found similar results, with protection associated with natural immunity ranging from 80.5% to 100%. This level of protection is similar to that reported for mRNA vaccines. The findings that patients with prior COVID-19 had 88% protection against hospitalization for COVID-19 and 83% protection against COVID-19 not requiring hospitalization suggest that natural immunity was associated with similar protection against mild and severe disease. mRNA vaccines are associated with similar prolonged protection from severe COVID-19 as found in our study, although vaccine-associated protection from mild COVID-19 has been shown to wane at 6 months.

Limitations include possible COVID-19 testing or vaccination at outside health care facilities, but undetected infection should have been balanced between cases and controls. Patients who have recovered from COVID-19 may behave differently from those without immunity, potentially confounding results. Strengths include large sample size, long duration of follow-up, and inclusion of only unvaccinated individuals with symptomatic COVID-19. The findings of this study may have important implications for vaccine policy and public health.

### Comparing COVID-19-related hospitalization rates among individuals with infection-induced and vaccine-induced immunity in Israel [^481f8efc]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Over 2 years after the first reported case of SARS-CoV-2, the COVID-19 pandemic is still ongoing, with many countries experiencing new waves of infections and entering further lockdowns. Widespread vaccination campaigns are underway all over the world, although with extremely variable levels of population coverage. Surges in healthcare utilization caused by pandemic wave peaks still pose a challenge to the capacity of healthcare systems.

Evidence of waning vaccine immunity over time has emerged: following the second vaccine, there is a significant drop in effectiveness against symptomatic infection; from a peak of ~90% in the weeks immediately following vaccination to a much lower 50–80% 6 months after vaccination –. As a result, some countries are offering booster vaccinations, amongst them Israel, in which ~4.5 million individuals have received a BNT162b2 booster dose. Studies from these countries have demonstrated the benefit of booster vaccines in reducing symptomatic COVID-19 infection and providing an even greater reduction in severe outcomes.

In contrast, the degree of protection provided by previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, also known as infection-induced immunity, remains unclear. Recent reports demonstrate what appears to be robust protection from infection-induced immunity against documented reinfection, however, both positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test and symptomatic COVID-19 as outcomes are sensitive to misclassification bias due to differential testing rates, as alluded to by the authors of these reports –. The degree of protection against outcomes that are less vulnerable to bias, such as COVID-19-related hospitalization, remains unclear. Policies regarding the management of recovered COVID-19 patients vary between countries, with some, including Israel, opting to vaccinate these individuals with a single "enhancer" dose 3 months after diagnosis of the infection. This policy is supported by the limited evidence that does exist, which demonstrates that recovered COVID-19 patients who receive a single vaccine dose have an approximately twofold reduced rate of reinfection compared to similar unvaccinated recovered individuals. Some countries offer two vaccine doses to recovered individuals based on evidence of improved protection with a second dose.

### Effectiveness of COVID-19 mRNA vaccination in preventing COVID-19-associated hospitalization among adults with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection-United States, June 2021-February 2022 [^d76c8fec]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2022). Medium credibility.

 Among persons with a previous infection < 180 days and ≥ 180 days before dose 1, adjusted VE after dose 1 was 43.2% (95% CI = 25.3%–56.8%) and 36.8% (95% CI = 14.0%–53.5%), respectively; adjusted VE after dose 2 was 37.6% (95% CI = 29.6%–44.6%) for persons with a previous infection < 180 days before dose 1 and 38.9% (95% CI = 28.2%–48.1%) for persons with a previous infection ≥ 180 days before dose 1; adjusted VE after a booster dose was 72.5% (95% CI = 65.2%–78.2%) for persons with a previous infection < 180 days before dose 1 and 46.7% (95% CI = 24.9%–62.2%) for persons with a previous infection ≥ 180 days before dose 1.

### Comparing COVID-19-related hospitalization rates among individuals with infection-induced and vaccine-induced immunity in Israel [^31177a59]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

The case for universal booster vaccines remains a contentious issuedespite a number of recent publications demonstrating a substantial risk reduction in COVID-19-related outcomes from booster vaccines. We corroborate previous publications, showing that individuals with non-recent vaccine immunity benefit from a booster dose, with much-increased protection against COVID-19-related hospitalization (incidence rate reduction of 89%). Furthermore, the magnitude of our estimated effect size for the benefit of a booster vaccine is in line with the previous studies.

We feel that the chosen outcome — COVID-19-related hospitalization — represents the best compromise between minimizing bias (largely circumventing the misclassification arising from differential testing rates across exposure groups common with less severe outcomes such as PCR-confirmed COVID-19 and symptomatic COVID-19) and maximizing statistical power (relative to more severe and less common outcomes such as severe COVID-19 illness and COVID-19-related death).

The findings in this report are subject to at least five limitations. First, underascertainment of vaccination status from available information would likely lead to an underestimation of VE, particularly if vaccinated control-patients were misclassified as unvaccinated; this might have led to lower estimated VE compared with similar analyses. Second, generalizability might be limited by incomplete data or by missing data from persons who do not seek health care; however, Cosmos data are broadly representative of the U.S. population. Third, several VE estimates were imprecise, with broad CIs; estimates should be interpreted with caution. Fourth, underascertainment of previous infection might have occurred because of dependence on EHR data; however, findings were similar when restricting analyses to case-patients with positive initial NAAT results, and the test-negative design for an endpoint of severe illness mitigates the risk for selection bias. Finally, there might be residual or unmeasured confounding by characteristics associated with exposure, vaccination, or hospitalization that were not recorded in the data set.

An increasing proportion of the U.S. population has had SARS-CoV-2 infection †††† and might be at risk for SARS-CoV-2 reinfection leading to hospitalization. In the current analysis, approximately 50% of these reinfections occurred during the Omicron-predominant period. Vaccination remains the safest strategy for preventing complications of SARS-CoV-2 infection. COVID-19 vaccination offers additional protection against reinfection leading to hospitalization, with a booster dose offering the highest level of protection. To prevent COVID-19–associated hospitalization, all eligible persons should stay up to date with vaccination, including those with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection.

### COVID-19-associated hospitalizations among vaccinated and unvaccinated adults 18 years or older in 13 US States, January 2021 to April 2022 [^6611cd42]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

As of April 30, 2022, 219.7 million people in the US had received a COVID-19 primary vaccine series, including more than 76% of the population 18 years or older. More than 100.6 million (45.8%) had also received additional or booster doses, which were recommended for people with immunosuppression in August 2021, all persons 65 years or older in September 2021, and all persons 18 years or older in November 2021. Data demonstrate that COVID-19 vaccines are strongly associated with prevention of COVID-19–associated hospitalization in adults, especially with the addition of a booster dose. Infections in vaccinated persons are expected, even in the setting of effective vaccines. Although most infections in vaccinated persons have been mild or asymptomatic, serious SARS-CoV-2 infections can occur in vaccinated persons. Using data from the Coronavirus Disease 2019–Associated Hospitalization Surveillance Network (COVID-NET), which represents more than 192 000 COVID-19–associated hospitalizations from January 2021 to April 2022, factors associated with hospitalizations among vaccinated persons were assessed. Population-based hospitalization rates by vaccination status were compared, including during the period when the highly transmissible B.1.1.529 (Omicron) variant of SARS-CoV-2 became the predominant circulating variant. Unlike previously published reports, and web pagesthat include COVID-NET data, this study reports hospitalization rates by vaccination status and clinical and demographic characteristics of hospitalized patients, beginning with the period when vaccines first became available, and includes comparisons of unvaccinated persons, persons vaccinated with a primary series without a booster dose, and those vaccinated with a primary series and at least 1 booster dose.

### COVID-19 disease incidence and severity in persons previously infected and unvaccinated vs previously uninfected and vaccinated [^e32f1adc]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Using the national COVID-19 database of the US Department of Veterans Affairs, we matched pairs of individuals who were previously uninfected and vaccinated (≥ 2 doses of an mRNA vaccine) and previously infected and unvaccinated. The incidence rate of breakthrough infection among vaccinated individuals (per 1000 person-days, 0.30; 95% CI, .29-.32) was similar to the reinfection rate among unvaccinated individuals (0.31; 95% CI, .30-.32; P = 0.5). The incidence rate of hospitalization/death was higher after reinfection (7.31; 95% CI, 6.66–8.03) as compared with the rate after breakthrough infection (4.69; 95% CI, 4.06–5.42; P < .0001). The incidence of hospitalization/death is significantly higher after reinfection among unvaccinated individuals as compared with breakthrough infection after vaccination.

### COVID-19-associated hospitalizations among vaccinated and unvaccinated adults 18 years or older in 13 US States, January 2021 to April 2022 [^426aca2a]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Importance

Understanding risk factors for hospitalization in vaccinated persons and the association of COVID-19 vaccines with hospitalization rates is critical for public health efforts to control COVID-19.

Objective

To determine characteristics of COVID-19-associated hospitalizations among vaccinated persons and comparative hospitalization rates in unvaccinated and vaccinated persons.

Design, Setting, and Participants

From January 1, 2021, to April 30, 2022, patients 18 years or older with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were identified from more than 250 hospitals in the population-based COVID-19-Associated Hospitalization Surveillance Network. State immunization information system data were linked to cases, and the vaccination coverage data of the defined catchment population were used to compare hospitalization rates in unvaccinated and vaccinated individuals. Vaccinated and unvaccinated patient characteristics were compared in a representative sample with detailed medical record review; unweighted case counts and weighted percentages were calculated.

Exposures

Laboratory-confirmed COVID-19-associated hospitalization, defined as a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result within 14 days before or during hospitalization.

Main Outcomes and Measures

COVID-19-associated hospitalization rates among vaccinated vs unvaccinated persons and factors associated with COVID-19-associated hospitalization in vaccinated persons were assessed.

Results

Using representative data from 192 509 hospitalizations (see Table 1 for demographic information), monthly COVID-19-associated hospitalization rates ranged from 3.5 times to 17.7 times higher in unvaccinated persons than vaccinated persons regardless of booster dose status. From January to April 2022, when the Omicron variant was predominant, hospitalization rates were 10.5 times higher in unvaccinated persons and 2.5 times higher in vaccinated persons with no booster dose, respectively, compared with those who had received a booster dose. Among sampled cases, vaccinated hospitalized patients with COVID-19 were older than those who were unvaccinated (median [IQR] age, 70 [58–80] years vs 58 [46–70] years, respectively; P < .001) and more likely to have 3 or more underlying medical conditions (1926 [77.8%] vs 4124 [51.6%], respectively; P < .001).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this cross-sectional study of US adults hospitalized with COVID-19, unvaccinated adults were more likely to be hospitalized compared with vaccinated adults; hospitalization rates were lowest in those who had received a booster dose. Hospitalized vaccinated persons were older and more likely to have 3 or more underlying medical conditions and be long-term care facility residents compared with hospitalized unvaccinated persons. The study results suggest that clinicians and public health practitioners should continue to promote vaccination with all recommended doses for eligible persons.

### Summary of guidance for minimizing the impact of COVID-19 on individual persons, communities, and health care systems-United States, August 2022 [^2ae28d4c]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2022). Medium credibility.

As SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, continues to circulate globally, high levels of vaccine- and infection-induced immunity and the availability of effective treatments and prevention tools have substantially reduced the risk for medically significant COVID-19 illness (severe acute illness and post-COVID-19 conditions) and associated hospitalization and death (1). These circumstances now allow public health efforts to minimize the individual and societal health impacts of COVID-19 by focusing on sustainable measures to further reduce medically significant illness as well as to minimize strain on the health care system, while reducing barriers to social, educational, and economic activity (2). Individual risk for medically significant COVID-19 depends on a person's risk for exposure to SARS-CoV-2 and their risk for developing severe illness if infected (3). Exposure risk can be mitigated through nonpharmaceutical interventions, including improving ventilation, use of masks or respirators indoors, and testing (4). The risk for medically significant illness increases with age, disability status, and underlying medical conditions but is considerably reduced by immunity derived from vaccination, previous infection, or both, as well as timely access to effective biomedical prevention measures and treatments (3,5). CDC's public health recommendations change in response to evolving science, the availability of biomedical and public health tools, and changes in context, such as levels of immunity in the population and currently circulating variants. CDC recommends a strategic approach to minimizing the impact of COVID-19 on health and society that relies on vaccination and therapeutics to prevent severe illness; use of multicomponent prevention measures where feasible; and particular emphasis on protecting persons at high risk for severe illness. Efforts to expand access to vaccination and therapeutics, including the use of preexposure prophylaxis for persons who are immunocompromised, antiviral agents, and therapeutic monoclonal antibodies, should be intensified to reduce the risk for medically significant illness and death. Efforts to protect persons at high risk for severe illness must ensure that all persons have access to information to understand their individual risk, as well as efficient and equitable access to vaccination, therapeutics, testing, and other prevention measures. Current priorities for preventing medically significant illness should focus on ensuring that persons 1) understand their risk, 2) take steps to protect themselves and others through vaccines, therapeutics, and nonpharmaceutical interventions when needed, 3) receive testing and wear masks if they have been exposed, and 4) receive testing if they are symptomatic, and isolate for ≥ 5 days if they are infected.

### Trends in COVID-19 hospital outcomes in england before and after vaccine introduction, a cohort study [^479d617e]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

It is now well established that a segment of the population who acquire severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, the virus responsible for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), in the community will require hospitalisation, potential escalation to intensive care facilities, and may die in hospital or soon after discharge. COVID-19 has been shown to disproportionately impact older people and those with multiple co-morbidities, compared to younger, healthier individuals, and there is considerable evidence that these factors heavily influence prognosis following hospital admission for COVID-19 –.

The extensive vaccination campaign in England during 2021 has dramatically changed the outlook for COVID-19, lessening symptoms and reducing morbidity and mortality. Despite widespread and high levels of vaccination, however, individuals continue to experience COVID-19 infection severe enough to require hospitalisation. Several studies have previously examined COVID-19 hospitalised fatality risk (HFR) in England according to baseline demographic factors. but there is little information about prognosis in the current context of vaccination across the population and how this might be related to hospital load.

We aimed to investigate trends in mortality within 90 days of hospitalisation with COVID-19 among a national cohort of all people hospitalised with community-onset COVID-19 in England and how these trends vary according to vaccination status, hospital load, and other factors. We apply statistical methods which account for competing outcomes to estimate absolute and relative risks of hospitalised fatality, and lengths of stay in hospital by outcome, and control for or assess the potential impact of different biases.

### The relationship of COVID-19 vaccination with mortality among 86, 732 hospitalized patients: subpopulations, patient factors, and changes over time [^2d566993]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

COVID-19 has disrupted virtually every aspect of society, infecting over 85 million individuals in the USA and causing over one million COVID deaths through June 2022. Vaccination with any of the FDA-approved SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) vaccinations can prevent more severe COVID-19 disease, – protect against different COVID-19 variants, – and produce persistent effects. However, important knowledge gaps remain.

Little research has examined vaccination effects in hospitalized populations, patients that typically have the most severe COVID disease. While some studies track individuals as they transition from nonhospitalized to hospitalization status,– there is less research on vaccination effects in large, hospitalized samples. Research with relatively small samples of hospitalized patients shows that vaccination reduces mortality. However, the small sample sizes of these studies limit the ability to determine associations between vaccination and disease severity in specific patient groups. Such information could reveal groups who would benefit from additional preventive or ameliorative actions to reduce their risk of COVID-19 morbidity or mortality.

This study examined associations between COVID-19 vaccination status and mortality in a sample of 86,732 patients who were hospitalized with COVID-19 from January 2021, when COVID-19 vaccination became generally available, to January 2022.

Key Points

Question

How do COVID-19–associated hospitalization rates compare among adults who are unvaccinated and vaccinated, and what are the risk factors for hospitalization for COVID-19 among vaccinated persons?

Findings

In this cross-sectional study of US adults hospitalized with COVID-19 during January 2022 to April 2022 (during Omicron variant predominance), COVID-19-associated hospitalization rates were 10.5 times higher in unvaccinated persons and 2.5 times higher in vaccinated persons with no booster dose, respectively, compared with those who had received a booster dose. Compared with unvaccinated hospitalized persons, vaccinated hospitalized persons were more likely to be older and have more underlying medical conditions.

Meaning

The study results suggest that COVID-19 vaccines are strongly associated with prevention of serious COVID-19 illness.

### Effectiveness associated with vaccination after COVID-19 recovery in preventing reinfection [^741e8bf9]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Importance

The benefit of vaccination for preventing reinfection among individuals who have been previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 is largely unknown.

Objective

To obtain population-based estimates of the probability of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection and the effectiveness associated with vaccination after recovery from COVID-19.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cohort study used Rhode Island statewide surveillance data from March 1, 2020, to December 9, 2021, on COVID-19 vaccinations, laboratory-confirmed cases, hospitalizations, and fatalities to conduct a population-based, retrospective study during periods when wild type, Alpha, and Delta strains of SARS-CoV-2 were predominant. Participants included Rhode Island residents aged 12 years and older who were previously diagnosed with COVID-19 and unvaccinated at the time of first infection, stratified into 3 subpopulations: long-term congregate care (LTCC) residents, LTCC employees, and the general population (ie, individuals not associated with congregate settings). Data were analyzed from October 2021 to January 2022.

Exposures

Completion of the primary vaccination series, defined as 14 days after the second dose of an mRNA vaccine or 1 dose of vector virus vaccine.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The main outcome was SARS-CoV-2 reinfection, defined as a laboratory-confirmed positive result on a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or antigen test at least 90 days after the first laboratory-confirmed positive result on a PCR or antigen test.

Results

Overall, 3124 LTCC residents (median [IQR] age, 81 [71–89]; 1675 [53.6%] females), 2877 LTCC employees (median [IQR] age, 41 [30–53]; 2186 [76.0%] females), and 94 516 members of the general population (median [IQR] age, 35 [24–52] years; 45 030 [47.6%] females) met eligibility criteria. Probability of reinfection at 9 months for those who remained unvaccinated after recovery from prior COVID-19 was 13.0% (95% CI, 12.0%-14.0%) among LTCC residents, 10.0% (95% CI, 8.8%-11.5%) among LTCC employees, and 1.9% (95% CI, 1.8%-2.0%) among the general population. Completion of the primary vaccination series after infection was associated with 49% (95% CI, 27%-65%) protection among LTCC residents, 47% (95% CI, 19%-65%) protection among LTCC employees, and 62% (95% CI, 56%-68%) protection in the general population against reinfection, adjusting for potential sociodemographic and clinical confounders and temporal variation in infection rates.

Conclusions and Relevance

These findings suggest that risk of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection after recovery from COVID-19 was relatively high among individuals who remained unvaccinated. Vaccination after recovery from COVID-19 was associated with reducing risk of reinfection by approximately half.

### COVID-19-associated hospitalizations among vaccinated and unvaccinated adults 18 years or older in 13 US States, January 2021 to April 2022 [^164619ee]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Conclusions

In this cross-sectional study of US adults hospitalized with COVID-19 during the first year of vaccine availability in the US, COVID-19–associated hospitalization rates in unvaccinated adults were more than 10 times higher than in vaccinated persons, a salient finding when many eligible Americans remained unvaccinated. COVID-19 vaccines, including booster doses, are strongly associated with prevention of COVID-19–associated hospitalizations, and vaccination is effective in averting serious clinical consequences. To reduce COVID-19–associated morbidity and mortality, clinicians and public health practitioners should continue to promote COVID-19 vaccinations with all recommended doses for all eligible persons.

### Comparing COVID-19-related hospitalization rates among individuals with infection-induced and vaccine-induced immunity in Israel [^a02db504]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

With the COVID-19 pandemic ongoing, accurate assessment of population immunity and the effectiveness of booster and enhancer vaccine doses is critical. We compare COVID-19-related hospitalization incidence rates in 2,412,755 individuals across four exposure levels: non-recent vaccine immunity (two BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine doses five or more months prior), boosted vaccine immunity (three BNT162b2 doses), infection-induced immunity (previous COVID-19 without a subsequent BNT162b2 dose), and enhanced infection-induced immunity (previous COVID-19 with a subsequent BNT162b2 dose). Rates, adjusted for potential demographic, clinical and health-seeking-behavior confounders, were assessed from July-November 2021 when the Delta variant was predominant. Compared with non-recent vaccine immunity, COVID-19-related hospitalization incidence rates were reduced by 89% (87–91%) for boosted vaccine immunity, 66% (50–77%) for infection-induced immunity and 75% (61–83%) for enhanced infection-induced immunity. We demonstrate that infection-induced immunity (enhanced or not) provides more protection against COVID-19-related hospitalization than non-recent vaccine immunity, but less protection than booster vaccination. Additionally, our results suggest that vaccinating individuals with infection-induced immunity further enhances their protection.

### COVID-19-associated hospitalizations among vaccinated and unvaccinated adults 18 years or older in 13 US States, January 2021 to April 2022 [^73787280]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Consistent with other studies, hospitalized cases among vaccinated persons occurred in older and more medically fragile populations. People at the greatest risk of severe disease (including those older than 75 years, with immunosuppression, with underlying medical conditions, and those who reside in LTCFs) may also be among those less likely to mount an adequate immune response to vaccination and SARS-CoV-2 infection. The study results suggest that persons with underlying conditions are more likely to be vaccinated, and those who were hospitalized despite vaccination may be more vulnerable to severe infection at baseline than those who are unvaccinated. Vaccination likely attenuates disease severity if infection occurs in a vaccinated person, but the current study found that conditional on being hospitalized, vaccinated persons were still at a high risk of severe outcomes. Although vaccinated patients had a shorter length of stay than unvaccinated patients, after adjusting for multiple factors, there was no clear difference in the risk for ICU admission or in-hospital death between vaccinated and unvaccinated persons, likely reflecting that those who were hospitalized despite vaccination may be more vulnerable to severe infection at baseline than those who are unvaccinated. Unidentified confounders that are not well accounted for may also be associated with these results; further detailed analyses examining clinical presentation and outcomes are ongoing.

The study finding that a substantial and growing proportion of people hospitalized with COVID-19 were vaccinated is not surprising; the proportion of hospitalized cases who are vaccinated, including those who are boosted, is expected to increase as population vaccination coverage and receipt of booster doses increases. Given high vaccination coverage, particularly in older age groups (more than 89% for those 65 years or older by April 2022 had received at least a primary vaccination series), the finding that proportionately less (75%) of hospitalized patients in that age group and that month were vaccinated is consistent with what is expected from effective vaccines. However, the high proportion of hospitalized patients who were vaccinated suggests not only a need for all people to stay up to date with vaccination, including additional boosters doses for eligible persons, but also for increased use of early outpatient antiviral treatment for patients at high riskof severe COVID-19 regardless of vaccination status, and the use of preexposure prophylaxis, such as tixagevimab-cilgavimab, in patients with an immunocompromising condition that may result in an inadequate immune response to COVID-19 vaccination.

### Factors influencing estimated effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines in non-randomised studies [^1c3c2eb9]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Death attribution

The vaccinated group may have a lesser chance of having deaths attributed to COVID-19 rather than to other causes, if vaccines are perceived as very effective, while unvaccinated people may have their deaths attributed to COVID-19 more easily. Conversely, the unvaccinated group may have a lower chance of having deaths attributed to COVID-19, if the unvaccinated group deaths occur in environments that are less able to pursue COVID-19 diagnosis (eg, disadvantaged populations). There is no direct evidence to date for differential death attribution based on vaccination status, but there is evidence that deaths can be overattributed to COVID-19, while in other situations COVID-19 deaths may be missed, so the differential attribution according to vaccination status is possible as a form of diagnosis bias.

Outcomes affected

As shown in table 1, all of these factors may impact the estimated effects for deaths. With the exception of death attribution and treatment use choices after hospital admission, all other factors may also impact the estimated effects for hospitalisations. Pre-existing immunity, vaccination misclassification, exposure differences and testing bias may impact the estimated effects for infection outcomes.

### Factors influencing estimated effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines in non-randomised studies [^69b6c999]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Non-randomised studies assessing COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness need to consider multiple factors that may generate spurious estimates due to bias or genuinely modify effectiveness. These include pre-existing immunity, vaccination misclassification, exposure differences, testing, disease risk factor confounding, hospital admission decision, treatment use differences, and death attribution. It is useful to separate whether the impact of each factor admission decision, treatment use differences, and death attribution. Steps and measures to consider for improving vaccine effectiveness estimation include registration of studies and of analysis plans; sharing of raw data and code; background collection of reliable information; blinded assessment of outcomes, e.g. death causes; using maximal/best information in properly-matched studies, multivariable analyses, propensity analyses, and other models; performing randomised trials, whenever possible, for suitable questions, e.g. booster doses or comparative effectiveness of different vaccination strategies; living meta-analyses of vaccine effectiveness; better communication with both relative and absolute metrics of risk reduction and presentation of uncertainty; and avoidance of exaggeration in communicating results to the general public.

To understand how coronavirus disease 2019 vaccines impact infection risk in children < 5 years, we assessed risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection from September 2022 to April 2023 in 3 cohort studies. There was no difference in risk by vaccination status. While vaccines reduce severe disease, they may not reduce SARS-CoV-2 infections in naïve young children.

### Optimal annual COVID-19 vaccine boosting dates following previous booster vaccination or breakthrough infection [^6138413f]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

COVID-19 booster vaccinations mitigate transmission and reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with infection. However, the optimal date for booster administration remains uncertain. Geographic variation in infection rates throughout the year makes it challenging to intuit the best yearly booster administration date to effectively prevent infection, and also challenging to provide best guidance on how to alter booster administration in response to a breakthrough infection.

Methods

We leveraged longitudinal antibody and reinfection probabilities with spatiotemporal projections of COVID-19 incidence to develop a geographically informed approach to optimizing the timing of booster vaccination. We assessed the delay in booster vaccination that is warranted following breakthrough infections whenever they occur during the year, enabling a personalized assessment of optimal timing that acknowledges and respects diversity of COVID-19 immune status, addressing a substantial barrier to uptake.

Results

Yearly booster vaccination on any date is beneficial to prevention of infection. However, each location exhibits as much as a 3-4-fold range in degree of protection by date of uptake. Optimal COVID-19 booster vaccination dates are location-specific, typically in early autumn in the Northern Hemisphere. Infection late in the interval between boosts substantially alters the optimal boosting date.

Conclusions

Considerable benefit accrues from aptly timing COVID-19 booster vaccination campaigns, which can be tailored to specific locations. Individuals can acquire the greatest benefit from booster vaccination by timing it optimally, including delaying in cases of infection late in the interval between boosts. These results provide location-specific guidance for public health policy, healthcare provider recommendations, and individual decision-making.

### Risk factors for severe COVID-19 outcomes among persons aged ≥ 18 years who completed a primary COVID-19 vaccination series-465 health care facilities, United States, December 2020-October 2021 [^ab8b943a]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2022). Medium credibility.

Approximately 70% of eligible adults in the United States have completed a primary COVID-19 vaccination series. §§§§ With the emergence of novel variants of concern and development of additional therapeutic strategies, studies in vaccinated populations are vital to guide targeted guidelines and interventions for persons at risk for severe outcomes. COVID-19–associated outcomes occurred in a small proportion of persons (0.015%) who had completed primary vaccination, all of whom were aged ≥ 65 years, immunosuppressed, or had other underlying conditions. Even when vaccinated, persons with identifiable risk factors should receive interventions including chronic disease management, precautions to reduce exposure, additional primary and booster vaccine doses, and effective pharmaceutical therapy as indicated to reduce risk for severe COVID-19–associated outcomes. Increasing COVID-19 vaccination coverage is a public health priority.

### Laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 among adults hospitalized with COVID-19-like illness with infection-induced or mRNA vaccine-induced SARS-CoV-2 immunity-nine States, January-September 2021 [^6169fde1]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2021). Medium credibility.

Previous infection with SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) or COVID-19 vaccination can provide immunity and protection from subsequent SARS-CoV-2 infection and illness. CDC used data from the VISION Network* to examine hospitalizations in adults with COVID-19-like illness and compared the odds of receiving a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result, and thus having laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, between unvaccinated patients with a previous SARS-CoV-2 infection occurring 90–179 days before COVID-19-like illness hospitalization, and patients who were fully vaccinated with an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine 90–179 days before hospitalization with no previous documented SARS-CoV-2 infection. Hospitalized adults aged ≥ 18 years with COVID-19-like illness were included if they had received testing at least twice: once associated with a COVID-19-like illness hospitalization during January-September 2021 and at least once earlier (since February 1, 2020, and ≥ 14 days before that hospitalization). Among COVID-19-like illness hospitalizations in persons whose previous infection or vaccination occurred 90–179 days earlier, the odds of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 (adjusted for sociodemographic and health characteristics) among unvaccinated, previously infected adults were higher than the odds among fully vaccinated recipients of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine with no previous documented infection (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 5.49; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.75–10.99). These findings suggest that among hospitalized adults with COVID-19-like illness whose previous infection or vaccination occurred 90–179 days earlier, vaccine-induced immunity was more protective than infection-induced immunity against laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. All eligible persons should be vaccinated against COVID-19 as soon as possible, including unvaccinated persons previously infected with SARS-CoV-2.

Baseline cohort characteristics and model parameters for severe COVID-19 risk and vaccine effectiveness

a Seroprevalence estimated by nucleocapsid antibody to support history of natural infection, with adjustment for number of infections since the last survey to approximate September 2022.

b Incidence estimates for severe COVID-19 (defined by hospitalization or death) were generated using publicly available US CDC data, averaging over 6 months preceding September 2022, coinciding with introduction of the bivalent vaccine.

See Appendix for further methodologic description.

We simulated a two-year time horizon, which was chosen to allow adequate time for comparison of vaccine strategies (i.e. one year time horizon would not allow estimation of differences from one-time and annual strategies). We assumed a hypothetical fixed population with no aging or demography. The start of the simulation (time 0) coincided with approximately September 2022, alongside introduction of the bivalent vaccine in the United States.

During the simulation, we applied an individual-specific, time-varying probability of SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe COVID-19 for each month time step, informed by the model calibration using COVID-19 surveillance datasets (see Calibration and Validation section). This probability combined a fixed group-specific 'force of infection' term by age and immune status and an individual, time-varying level of protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe COVID-19. An individual's risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe disease changed over time as protection waned. The primary analysis used a static model of infection, meaning we did not account for indirect effects due to vaccination (i.e. reduced transmission due to vaccine-induced protection), although we did test a dynamic transmission model in an alternative analysis (see Scenario Analysis). Each person's level of protection was based on vaccine status (time since last vaccine) and prior infection history (time since last infection, if applicable). This model explicitly accounted for waning of protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe COVID-19 independently based on timing of last vaccination and prior infection, which was estimated from literature –, (Supplementary Tables S1 - S2). We separately modeled individuals as either having vaccine-induced (without prior infection) or hybrid immunity (defined as vaccination with documented prior infection) since literature suggests far higher and more durable protection for hybrid immunity, (Supplementary Fig. S1).

### The relationship of COVID-19 vaccination with mortality among 86, 732 hospitalized patients: subpopulations, patient factors, and changes over time [^1b547156]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

In this large, diverse sample of 86,732 patients with COVID-19 hospitalized from January 1, 2021, to January 31, 2022, vaccination for COVID-19 was associated with significantly reduced mortality. Overall, in analyses in which results were adjusted for covariates that are often associated with COVID-19 severity, – the mortality rates were 5.1% and 8.3% for vaccinated and unvaccinated patients, respectively. When patients were "restricted" to those who had no immune compromised or suppressed diagnoses, the association between the number of vaccination doses and mortality became somewhat stronger. Thus, in the Restricted subsample, the adjusted mortality rate for patients who were not immunized was 7.9% while it was only 3.5% in those who had received three vaccine doses. This underscores the value of additional vaccine doses or booster vaccinations even among patients sufficiently ill so as to require hospitalization

### Impact of prior COVID-19 infection on perceptions about the benefit and safety of COVID-19 vaccines [^9e4e5862]. American Journal of Infection Control (2024). Medium credibility.

In this online survey of 1,733 US adults in December 2021, respondents believed COVID-19 vaccines are less beneficial and less safe for someone who had already had COVID-19. Those who experienced COVID-19 after being vaccinated believed that the vaccines are less beneficial and less safe than those who had not. Findings highlight the need to better communicate evolving evidence of COVID-19 vaccine benefit and safety and to tailor communications to peoples' COVID-19 history and vaccination status.

### The relationship of COVID-19 vaccination with mortality among 86, 732 hospitalized patients: subpopulations, patient factors, and changes over time [^c548cd46]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Information on COVID-19 vaccination effects on mortality among patients hospitalized with COVID-19 could inform vaccination outreach efforts and increase understanding of patient risk.

Objective

Determine the associations of vaccination status with mortality in adult patients hospitalized with COVID-19.

Design

This retrospective cohort study assessed the characteristics and mortality rates of adult patients hospitalized with COVID-19 across 21 healthcare systems in the USA from January 1, 2021, to January 31, 2022.

Participants

Adult patients admitted to participating hospitals who had COVID-19 diagnoses and/or positive PCR tests and completed their hospital stay via discharge or death.

Main Measure

In-hospital mortality vs. discharge (outcome) and patient age, sex, race, ethnicity, BMI, insurance status, comorbidities, and vaccination status extracted from the electronic health record (EHR).

Key Results

Of 86,732 adult patients hospitalized with COVID-19, 45,082 (52%) were female, mean age was 60 years, 20,800 (24%) were Black, and 22,792 (26.3%) had one or more COVID-19 vaccinations. Statistically adjusted mortality rates for unvaccinated and vaccinated patients were 8.3% (95% CI, 8.1–8.5) and 5.1% (95% CI, 4.8–5.4) respectively (7.9% vs. 4.5% with no immune compromise). Vaccination was associated with especially large reductions in mortality for obese (OR = 0.67; 95% CI 0.56–0.80) and severely obese (OR = 0.52; 95% CI, 0.41–0.67) patients and for older patients (OR = 0.99; 95% CI, 0.98–0.99). Mortality likelihood was higher later in the study period (August 2021-January 31, 2022) than earlier (January 1, 2021-July 30, 2021) (OR = 1.10; 95% CI = 1.04–1.17) and increased significantly for vaccinated patients from 4.6% (95% CI, 3.9–5.2%) to 6.5% (95% CI, 6.2–6.9%).

Conclusions

Patients vaccinated for COVID-19 had reduced mortality, especially for obese/severely obese and older individuals. Vaccination's protective effect against mortality declined over time and hospitalized obese and older individuals may derive especially great benefit from prior vaccination against SARS-CoV-2.

### SARS-CoV-2 infection and hospitalization among adults aged ≥ 18 years, by vaccination status, before and during SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.529 (omicron) variant predominance-los angeles county, California, November 7, 2021-January 8, 2022 [^3554ac2f]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2022). Medium credibility.

Although disease severity appears to be lower for Omicron, a rapid increase in infections during Omicron predominance has resulted in a relatively substantial volume of hospitalizations. The high volume of hospitalizations during a surge can compound the effects of staffing shortages and staff member burnout, which puts a strain on the health care sector. The rise in hospitalization rates in LAC was most pronounced among unvaccinated persons, whereas hospitalization rates remained lower among those who were fully vaccinated, and lowest among those who had received a booster. Being up to date with COVID-19 vaccinations is a critical component of reducing the strain on health care facilities.

The findings in this report are subject to at least five limitations. First, vaccination data for persons who lived in LAC at the time of their laboratory-confirmed infection, but who were vaccinated outside of California, were unavailable, leading to misclassification of their vaccination status; if vaccinated persons without accessible records were considered unvaccinated, the incidence in unvaccinated persons could be underestimated. Some boosters might have been misclassified as first doses, and the persons receiving these might have been incorrectly classified as partially vaccinated and excluded. Second, aside from age adjustment, it was not possible to control for other factors that are associated with vaccine coverage, such as sex and race/ethnicity. Differences in vaccination and booster coverage by these characteristics, especially if proportionally different from that of SARS-CoV-2 infections, could affect generalizability of these results to LAC and other populations or jurisdictions. Third, the risks for SARS-CoV-2 infection are not equal for everyone; the likelihood of exposure might influence the likelihood of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance and coverage. External risk factors related to the possibility of infection and hospitalization, such as sample characteristics and social determinants of health, are important to consider when interpreting these findings. Fourth, COVID-19–associated hospitalizations were determined based on hospital admission and SARS-CoV-2 test dates alone, potentially leading to the inclusion of incidental positive SARS-CoV-2 test results in patients whose hospitalizations were not caused by COVID-19. Finally, genomic sequencing data were available for only a sample of SARS-CoV-2 specimens and not representative of all infections; however, the variant predominance trends were consistent with what has been reported nationally during these periods.

### Effectiveness associated with vaccination after COVID-19 recovery in preventing reinfection [^6cedc6ff]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Discussion

This cohort study is among the first, to our knowledge, to examine VE among people who recovered from COVID-19 and were unvaccinated at the time of their first infection; that is, we examined the effectiveness associated with vaccination after a primary infection. This analysis provides important information for guideline development, particularly relating to residents of LTCC facilities and employees who work in these settings. Previous infection is now taken into account in the development of US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelinesand has been used as an argument against vaccine requirements.

Using a statewide population cohort, we found that probability of reinfection within 9 months of recovery from primary infection with SARS-CoV-2 was approximately 2% in the unvaccinated general population, but 10% in LTCC employees and 13% among LTCC residents. Using a prospective event-history analysis with vaccine exposure as a time-varying covariate, we found that the VE associated with CPVS after recovery from prior SARS-CoV-2 infection was 62% for the general population and 49% for both residents and employees of LTCC facilities. These estimates adjusted for age, sex, race and ethnicity, community COVID-19 risk, symptom and hospitalization status during the primary SARS-CoV-2 infection, and timing of entry into the risk cohort relative to the onset of the pandemic (calendar time). The findings of our statewide cohort study suggest that vaccination after recovery from prior COVID-19 was associated with substantial benefit for preventing subsequent reinfection, with risk reduced by nearly half for all subpopulations. Among LTCC residents and employees, for whom the probability of reinfection at 9 months after primary infection among those who remained unvaccinated was at least 5-fold greater than in the general population (10%-13% vs 2%), this is a particularly notable finding.

### Comparing frequency of booster vaccination to prevent severe COVID-19 by risk group in the United States [^2901901c]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Both COVID-19 vaccination and natural infection from SARS-CoV-2 generate protection against future risk of COVID-19; however, this protection wanes over time, in part due to new variants –. While waning protection from vaccination and natural infection against SARS-CoV-2 infection is well-documented, recent analyses have also found some waning of protection against severe COVID-19 (defined as hospitalization or death) –. Studies further suggest that additional booster vaccine doses or natural infection can restore the level of protection despite this prior decline. A key question remains: what is the comparative effectiveness of different frequencies of COVID-19 booster vaccination in key risk groups to offset waning of protection against severe disease?

While there was considerable study of vaccine prioritization during the introduction of the COVID-19 vaccine –, there is limited evidence to guide decisions on the timing of COVID-19 booster vaccination to prevent severe COVID-19. The risk for severe COVID-19 is complex and person-specific. Considerations to determine the frequency of COVID-19 booster vaccination (e.g. monovalent vaccines targeting one variant such as Omicron XBB.1.5, or bivalent vaccines targeting more than one variant, such as the ancestral strain and Omicron subvariants BA.4/5) for an individual include: i) baseline risk for severe COVID-19 given infection, correlated with increased age and presence of immunocompromising conditions; ii) vaccination history, including number of doses and time since last vaccination; iii) previous SARS-CoV-2 infection(s), including time since last infection and variant; and iv) overall risk of infection driven by levels of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the community. Given heterogeneity in risk of severe COVID-19 within the population, the comparative effectiveness of different frequencies of COVID-19 booster vaccination may vary based on key risk factors.

### Laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 among adults hospitalized with COVID-19-like illness with infection-induced or mRNA vaccine-induced SARS-CoV-2 immunity-nine States, January-September 2021 [^f3a254ba]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this multistate analysis of hospitalizations for COVID-19–like illness among adults aged ≥ 18 years during January–September 2021 whose previous infection or vaccination occurred 90–179 days earlier, the adjusted odds of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were higher among unvaccinated and previously infected patients than among those who were fully vaccinated with 2 doses of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine without previous documentation of a SARS-CoV-2 infection. Secondary analyses that did not adjust for time since infection or vaccination or adjusted time since infection or vaccination differently as well as before and during Delta variant predominance produced similar results. These findings are consistent with evidence that neutralizing antibody titers after receipt of 2 doses of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine are high; however, these findings differ from those of a retrospective records-based cohort study in Israel, †† which did not find higher protection for vaccinated adults compared with those with previous infection during a period of Delta variant circulation. This variation is possibly related to differences in the outcome of interest and restrictions on the timing of vaccination. The Israeli cohort study assessed any positive SARS-CoV-2 test result, whereas this study examined laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 among hospitalized patients. The Israeli cohort study also only examined vaccinations that had occurred 6 months earlier, so the benefit of more recent vaccination was not examined. This report focused on the early protection from infection-induced and vaccine-induced immunity, though it is possible that estimates could be affected by time. Understanding infection-induced and vaccine-induced immunity over time is important, particularly for future studies to consider.

### Effectiveness associated with vaccination after COVID-19 recovery in preventing reinfection [^331f5e45]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Conclusions

The findings of this cohort study suggest that risk of reinfection after recovery from COVID-19 was relatively high among individuals who remained unvaccinated, including the general population and LTCC residents and employees. Vaccination after recovery from COVID-19 was associated with substantial benefit, reducing risk of reinfection by approximately half. Individuals who have recovered from COVID-19 and remain unvaccinated should be encouraged to complete vaccinations, as they are eligible, to reduce their risk of reinfection.

### Epidemiology and clinical presentation of COVID-19 in older adults [^c4968db4]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection remains asymptomatic in 33% to 90% of older adults depending on their immune status from prior infection, vaccination, and circulating strain. Older adults symptomatic with SARS-CoV-2 often both present atypically, such as with a blunted fever response, and develop more severe disease. Early and late reports showed that older adults have increased severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) with higher case fatality rates and higher intensive care needs compared with younger adults. Infection and vaccine-induced antibody response and long-term effects of COVID-19 also differ in older adults.

### Association of primary and booster vaccination and prior infection with SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe COVID-19 outcomes [^a824198e]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Data about the association of COVID-19 vaccination and prior SARS-CoV-2 infection with risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe COVID-19 outcomes may guide prevention strategies.

Objective

To estimate the time-varying association of primary and booster COVID-19 vaccination and prior SARS-CoV-2 infection with subsequent SARS-CoV-2 infection, hospitalization, and death.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Cohort study of 10.6 million residents in North Carolina from March 2, 2020, through June 3, 2022.

Exposures

COVID-19 primary vaccine series and boosters and prior SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Rate ratio (RR) of SARS-CoV-2 infection and hazard ratio (HR) of COVID-19-related hospitalization and death.

Results

The median age among the 10.6 million participants was 39 years; 51.3% were female, 71.5% were White, and 9.9% were Hispanic. As of June 3, 2022, 67% of participants had been vaccinated. There were 2 771 364 SARS-CoV-2 infections, with a hospitalization rate of 6.3% and mortality rate of 1.4%. The adjusted RR of the primary vaccine series compared with being unvaccinated against infection became 0.53 (95% CI, 0.52–0.53) for BNT162b2, 0.52 (95% CI, 0.51–0.53) for mRNA-1273, and 0.51 (95% CI, 0.50–0.53) for Ad26.COV2.S 10 months after the first dose, but the adjusted HR for hospitalization remained at 0.29 (95% CI, 0.24–0.35) for BNT162b2, 0.27 (95% CI, 0.23–0.32) for mRNA-1273, and 0.35 (95% CI, 0.29–0.42) for Ad26.COV2.S and the adjusted HR of death remained at 0.23 (95% CI, 0.17–0.29) for BNT162b2, 0.15 (95% CI, 0.11–0.20) for mRNA-1273, and 0.24 (95% CI, 0.19–0.31) for Ad26.COV2.S. For the BNT162b2 primary series, boosting in December 2021 with BNT162b2 had the adjusted RR relative to primary series of 0.39 (95% CI, 0.38–0.40) and boosting with mRNA-1273 had the adjusted RR of 0.32 (95% CI, 0.30–0.34) against infection after 1 month and boosting with BNT162b2 had the adjusted RR of 0.84 (95% CI, 0.82–0.86) and boosting with mRNA-1273 had the adjusted RR of 0.60 (95% CI, 0.57–0.62) after 3 months. Among all participants, the adjusted RR of Omicron infection compared with no prior infection was estimated at 0.23 (95% CI, 0.22–0.24) against infection, and the adjusted HRs were 0.10 (95% CI, 0.07–0.14) against hospitalization and 0.11 (95% CI, 0.08–0.15) against death after 4 months.

Conclusions and Relevance

Receipt of primary COVID-19 vaccine series compared with being unvaccinated, receipt of boosters compared with primary vaccination, and prior infection compared with no prior infection were all significantly associated with lower risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection (including Omicron) and resulting hospitalization and death. The associated protection waned over time, especially against infection.

Real-world effectiveness — A growing number of real-world studies show similar overall vaccine effectiveness for preventing symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID-19, although vaccine effectiveness is likely lower for immunocompromised persons. Several studies assessing vaccine breakthrough infections in the general population indicate that COVID-19 vaccines reduce the risk of severe disease, hospitalization, and death, and vaccinated persons have decreased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and reduced risk for secondary infection and/or likelihood for transmission to contacts, including household contacts.

### Post-COVID-19-vaccination adverse events and healthcare utilization among individuals with or without previous SARS-CoV-2 infection [^49935f6f]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Post-marketing pharmacovigilance data are scant on the safety of Covid-19 vaccines among people with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection compared with ordinary vaccine recipients. We compared the post-vaccination adverse events of special interests (AESI), accident and emergency room (A&E) visit, and hospitalization between these two groups.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective cohort study using a territory-wide public healthcare database with population-based vaccination records in Hong Kong.

Results

In total, 3922 vaccine recipients with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection and 1,137,583 vaccine recipients without previous SARS-CoV-2 infection were included. No significant association was observed between previous SARS-CoV-2 infection and AESI or hospitalization. Previous SARS-CoV-2 infection was significantly associated with a lower risk of A&E visit (CoronaVac: hazard ratios [HR] = 0.56, 95% confidence intervals [CI]: 0.32–0.99; Comirnaty: HR = 0.62, 95% CI: 0.47–0.82).

Conclusion

No safety signal of Covid-19 vaccination was detected from the comparison between vaccine recipients with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection and those without infection.

### SARS-CoV-2 infection and hospitalization among adults aged ≥ 18 years, by vaccination status, before and during SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.529 (omicron) variant predominance-los angeles county, California, November 7, 2021-January 8, 2022 [^b579aa98]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2022). Medium credibility.

COVID-19 vaccines are effective at preventing infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, as well as severe COVID-19–associated outcomes in real-world conditions. The risks for SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19–associated hospitalization are lower among fully vaccinated than among unvaccinated persons; this reduction is even more pronounced among those who have received additional or booster doses (boosters). Although the B.1.1.529 (Omicron) variant spreads more rapidly than did earlier SARS-CoV-2 variants, recent studies suggest that disease severity is lower for Omicron compared with that associated with the B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant; but the high volume of infections is straining the health care system more than did previous waves. *, † The Los Angeles County (LAC) Department of Public Health (LACDPH) used COVID-19 surveillance and California Immunization Registry 2 (CAIR2) data to describe age-adjusted 14-day cumulative incidence and hospitalization rates during November 7, 2021–January 8, 2022, by COVID-19 vaccination status and variant predominance. For the 14-day period ending December 11, 2021, the last week of Delta predominance, the incidence and hospitalization rates among unvaccinated persons were 12.3 and 83.0 times, respectively, those of fully vaccinated persons with a booster and 3.8 and 12.9 times, respectively, those of fully vaccinated persons without a booster. These rate ratios were lower during Omicron predominance (week ending January 8, 2022), with unvaccinated persons having infection and hospitalization rates 3.6 and 23.0 times, respectively, those of fully vaccinated persons with a booster and 2.0 and 5.3 times, respectively, those of fully vaccinated persons without a booster. In addition, during the entire analytic period, admission to intensive care units (ICUs), intubation for mechanical ventilation, and death were more likely to occur among unvaccinated persons than among fully vaccinated persons without or with a booster (p < 0.001). Incidence and hospitalization rates were consistently highest for unvaccinated persons and lowest for fully vaccinated persons with a booster. Being up to date with COVID-19 vaccination is critical to protecting against SARS-CoV-2 infection and associated hospitalization.

### Estimated 2023–2024 COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness in adults [^33263323]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Waning was apparent in this analysis, including some strata 179 to 299 days after vaccination in which point estimates were negative. VE can be measured in multiple ways but is essentially a comparison between rates or risk of disease in vaccinated vs unvaccinated (or less vaccinated) populations. Persons who did not receive 2023–2024 COVID-19 vaccines were more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection soon after 2023–2024 COVID-19 vaccine rollout, which corresponds to the earlier time since dose strata, compared with those who received a 2023–2024 COVID-19 vaccine. Because prior SARS-CoV-2 infection provides some protection against future SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19, higher infection rates in the comparator population (ie, those without 2023–2024 vaccines) early in the study period may have temporarily provided them with higher infection-induced protection and reduced the measured VE with greater time since dose, resulting in negative VE estimates further from vaccination. Results in this analysis, which did not control for prior infection, suggest that the risk of COVID-19 among people who are more than 6 months from their 2023 to 2024 vaccination appears to be higher than unvaccinated people who may have had more recent prior infection. However, controlling for prior SARS-CoV-2 infection generally increases measured VE, lending further evidence that the measured VE in this analysis is likely an underestimate of vaccination's true protection. Lower VE in younger age groups, including negative VE, may be indicative of differences in who gets vaccinated or patterns of prior infection. Notably, none of the VE estimates against critical illness were negative, highlighting that updated COVID-19 vaccines continued to provide protection against the most severe outcomes and supporting COVID-19 vaccine recommendations.

### Risk factors for severe COVID-19 outcomes among persons aged ≥ 18 years who completed a primary COVID-19 vaccination series-465 health care facilities, United States, December 2020-October 2021 [^9f27d339]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2022). Medium credibility.

Population-wide data have demonstrated that COVID-19 hospitalization and death are more frequent among Hispanic, non-Hispanic Black, and non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaska Native persons than among non-Hispanic White persons. This might be explained by higher levels of SARS-CoV-2 exposure, reduced access to care, and higher rates of uncontrolled underlying conditions experienced by these populations; however, this study did not find an association between race/ethnicity and severe COVID-19 outcomes after primary vaccination, suggesting that COVID-19 vaccines are important for helping to mitigate racial and ethnic disparities exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Several factors could contribute to severe outcomes in populations who are at risk, including suboptimal response to vaccination, waning immunity, and predisposition to severe disease. Persons who might not have mounted a protective immune response after initial vaccination might benefit from an additional primary dose. Booster vaccination after primary vaccination has been demonstrated to further reduce the risk for infection, particularly severe COVID-19, and is recommended by CDC for all persons aged ≥ 18 years. ** Pharmaceutical therapies are also available for preventing and treating COVID-19 in at-risk populations. †††† In addition, findings from this study complement data from clinical trials suggesting that anti–SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies when appropriate might protect vaccinated persons with COVID-19 from experiencing severe outcomes.

The findings in this report are subject to at least five limitations. First, the reliance on procedure, diagnosis, and billing codes to define vaccination status, underlying conditions, and outcomes might have led to misclassification because of inaccurate or incomplete records. In addition, presence of underlying conditions might not be fully collected by administrative coding. Second, outcomes that occurred during COVID-19 encounters might have been related to other factors (e.g. diminished access to routine services for control of chronic diseases might have exacerbated severe outcomes in persons with comorbidities). Third, the components of the composite outcome are not necessarily of equal severity and results should be interpreted accordingly; the number of deaths alone was too small to allow analysis of risk factors in this subgroup. Fourth, persons with underlying conditions might be more likely to access health care, thereby disproportionately increasing COVID-19 risk estimates in this group compared with persons without underlying conditions. Finally, PHD-SR represents a convenience sample of health care facilities, limiting generalizability to the U.S. population.

### COVID-19 incidence and death rates among unvaccinated and fully vaccinated adults with and without booster doses during periods of delta and omicron variant emergence-25 U.S. jurisdictions, April 4-December 25, 2021 [^e32c2c32]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2022). Medium credibility.

Previous reports of COVID-19 case, hospitalization, and death rates by vaccination status † indicate that vaccine protection against infection, as well as serious COVID-19 illness for some groups, declined with the emergence of the B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, and waning of vaccine-induced immunity. During August–November 2021, CDC recommended § additional primary COVID-19 vaccine doses among immunocompromised persons and booster doses among persons aged ≥ 18 years. The SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.529 (Omicron) variant emerged in the United States during December 2021 and by December 25 accounted for 72% of sequenced lineages. To assess the impact of full vaccination with additional and booster doses (booster doses), case and death rates and incidence rate ratios (IRRs) were estimated among unvaccinated and fully vaccinated adults by receipt of booster doses during pre-Delta (April–May 2021), Delta emergence (June 2021), Delta predominance (July–November 2021), and Omicron emergence (December 2021) periods in the United States. During 2021, averaged weekly, age-standardized case IRRs among unvaccinated persons compared with fully vaccinated persons decreased from 13.9 pre-Delta to 8.7 as Delta emerged, and to 5.1 during the period of Delta predominance. During October–November, unvaccinated persons had 13.9 and 53.2 times the risks for infection and COVID-19–associated death, respectively, compared with fully vaccinated persons who received booster doses, and 4.0 and 12.7 times the risks compared with fully vaccinated persons without booster doses. When the Omicron variant emerged during December 2021, case IRRs decreased to 4.9 for fully vaccinated persons with booster doses and 2.8 for those without booster doses, relative to October–November 2021. The highest impact of booster doses against infection and death compared with full vaccination without booster doses was recorded among persons aged 50–64 and ≥ 65 years. Eligible persons should stay up to date with COVID-19 vaccinations.

### Are some COVID-19 vaccines better than others? Interpreting and comparing estimates of efficacy in vaccine trials [^c1ad45ed]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine trials provide valuable insight into the safety and efficacy of vaccines, with individually randomized, placebo-controlled trials being the gold standard in trial design. However, a myriad of variables must be considered as clinical trial data are interpreted and used to guide policy decisions. These variables include factors such as the characteristics of the study population and circulating severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) strains, the force of infection, the definition and ascertainment of endpoints, the timing of vaccine efficacy assessment, and the potential for performance bias. In this Viewpoints article, we discuss critical variables to consider when comparing efficacy measurements across current and future COVID-19 vaccine trials.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^55eda865]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

COVID-19 vaccine — evidence summary in people with HIV: Worse outcomes for people with HIV and COVID-19, including high COVID-19 mortality rates, have been reported in cohort studies from the United States, the United Kingdom, and South Africa, and HIV was independently associated with an increased risk of severe and critical COVID-19 in a trial that included data from 38 countries. In a multicenter cohort study of 286 people with HIV and COVID-19 in the United States, a lower CD4 count (i.e., < 200 cells/mm3) was associated with a higher risk for the composite endpoint of intensive care unit admission, invasive mechanical ventilation, or death, and a multisite clinical cohort showed an association between lower current (< 350 cells/mm3) and nadir (< 200 cells/mm3) CD4 counts and risk of hospitalization, intubation, or death without an association between viral load suppression and COVID-19 disease severity. Most people with HIV develop antibody responses to vaccination comparable to those measured in people without HIV; however, responses may be lower and antibody titers decline faster, particularly for individuals with CD4 counts < 200 cells/mm3. Rates of breakthrough infections after vaccination are higher among individuals with HIV, with vaccine efficacy declining sooner than in HIV-negative matched cohorts, and breakthrough infections showed no association with viral load suppression, though fewer breakthroughs were seen in individuals with CD4 counts ≥ 500 cells/mm3. Vaccine efficacy against more severe outcomes has been more robust than protection against infection or mild disease.

### Advisory committee on immunization practices recommended immunization schedule for children and adolescents aged 18 years or younger-United States, 2025 [^5ee733d8]. AAO (2025). High credibility.

COVID-19 and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) risk and vaccine impact are described as follows: older adults, immunocompromised individuals, and those with certain comorbidities are at risk for severe illness from COVID-19, and from October 2023 to May 2024, rates of hospitalization due to COVID-19 were greatest in adults 75 years of age or older. COVID-19 vaccination reduces the risk of severe disease, hospitalization, and death, with the 2023 to 2024 COVID-19 vaccines decreasing the risk of emergency department and urgent care visits by 50% in the first 2 months after vaccination; however, protection decreased over time, with little effect remaining 4 to 6 months after vaccination, and COVID-19 vaccines have been updated annually to address the currently circulating strains and waning immunity from prior vaccination and infection. For RSV, infants, young children, older adults, and people with immunocompromise are at risk for severe infection and hospitalization; approximately 100,000 to 150,000 adults 60 years of age or older are hospitalized for RSV annually in the United States; RSV is also the most common cause of pneumonia and bronchiolitis among children younger than 1 year of age; and other risk factors for severe RSV disease include medical comorbidities such as chronic cardiovascular, respiratory, hepatic, renal, or hematologic disease.

### COVID-19 and mental illnesses in vaccinated and unvaccinated people [^36b082ec]. JAMA Psychiatry (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

SARS-CoV-2 infection, and consequent COVID-19, are associated with subsequent mental illnesses in both hospital- and population-based studies, including both common mental health difficulties, such as anxiety and depressive symptoms, and serious mental illness, including psychotic disorders. Potential mechanisms include physiological pathways, such as inflammation and microvascular changes, and psychosocial effects, such as anxiety about the potential outcomes of COVID-19, including post–COVID-19 condition. Previous studies have identified associations of COVID-19 with mental illnesses in both hospitalized patients, and the general population. Differentiating between hospitalized patients and the general population may provide insights into the implications of COVID-19 severity for subsequent mental illnesses.

Rapid rollout of COVID-19 vaccination was a crucial component of the public health response. Although the impacts of vaccination in preventing and reducing the severity of COVID-19 are well established, there is limited evidence regarding the implications of vaccination for other adverse outcomes of COVID-19, including mental illnesses. We did not identify any studies investigating differences in mental illnesses following COVID-19 by vaccination status. Furthermore, rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection, vaccination, and disease severity may differ by sociodemographic and health factors, so mental health outcomes may also vary between subgroups.

Using electronic health record data from more than 18 million people, we examined associations of diagnosed COVID-19 with subsequent mental illnesses prior to vaccine availability and for unvaccinated and vaccinated people after vaccination became available. We compared rates of mental illnesses after COVID-19 with rates before or without COVID-19. We also examined associations in subgroups defined by COVID-19 severity, age, sex, ethnicity, prior mental illness, and prior COVID-19. Ethnicity data were reported because disparities in COVID-19 outcomes by ethnic group have been reported. Follow-up of those diagnosed with COVID-19 during the first year of the pandemic was for up to 2 years postdiagnosis.

### Risk of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection and COVID-19 hospitalisation in individuals with natural and hybrid immunity: a retrospective, total population cohort study in Sweden [^8d8839f9]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2022). High credibility.

Background

Real-world evidence supporting vaccination against COVID-19 in individuals who have recovered from a previous SARS-CoV-2 infection is sparse. We aimed to investigate the long-term protection from a previous infection (natural immunity) and whether natural immunity plus vaccination (hybrid immunity) was associated with additional protection.

Methods

In this retrospective cohort study, we formed three cohorts using Swedish nationwide registers managed by the Public Health Agency of Sweden, the National Board of Health and Welfare, and Statistics Sweden. Cohort 1 included unvaccinated individuals with natural immunity matched pairwise on birth year and sex to unvaccinated individuals without natural immunity at baseline. Cohort 2 and cohort 3 included individuals vaccinated with one dose (one-dose hybrid immunity) or two doses (two-dose hybrid immunity) of a COVID-19 vaccine, respectively, after a previous infection, matched pairwise on birth year and sex to individuals with natural immunity at baseline. Outcomes of this study were documented SARS-CoV-2 infection from March 20, 2020, until Oct 4, 2021, and inpatient hospitalisation with COVID-19 as main diagnosis from March 30, 2020, until Sept 5, 2021.

Findings

Cohort 1 was comprised of 2039106 individuals, cohort 2 of 962318 individuals, and cohort 3 of 567810 individuals. During a mean follow-up of 164 days (SD 100), 34090 individuals with natural immunity in cohort 1 were registered as having had a SARS-CoV-2 reinfection compared with 99168 infections in non-immune individuals; the numbers of hospitalisations were 3195 and 1976, respectively. After the first 3 months, natural immunity was associated with a 95% lower risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 0·05 [95% CI 0·05–0·05] p < 0·001) and an 87% (0·13 [0·11–0·16]; p < 0·001) lower risk of COVID-19 hospitalisation for up to 20 months of follow-up. During a mean follow-up of 52 days (SD 38) in cohort 2, 639 individuals with one-dose hybrid immunity were registered with a SARS-CoV-2 reinfection, compared with 1662 individuals with natural immunity (numbers of hospitalisations were eight and 113, respectively). One-dose hybrid immunity was associated with a 58% lower risk of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection (aHR 0·42 [95% CI 0·38–0·47]; p < 0·001) than natural immunity up to the first 2 months, with evidence of attenuation thereafter up to 9 months (p < 0·001) of follow-up. During a mean follow-up of 66 days (SD 53) in cohort 3, 438 individuals with two-dose hybrid immunity were registered as having had a SARS-CoV-2 reinfection, compared with 808 individuals with natural immunity (numbers of hospitalisations were six and 40, respectively). Two-dose hybrid immunity was associated with a 66% lower risk of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection (aHR 0·34 [95% CI 0·31–0·39]; p < 0·001) than natural immunity, with no significant attenuation up to 9 months (p = 0·07). To prevent one reinfection in the natural immunity cohort during follow-up, 767 individuals needed to be vaccinated with two doses. Both one-dose (HR adjusted for age and baseline date 0·06 [95% CI 0·03–0·12]; p < 0·001) and two-dose (HR adjusted for age and baseline date 0·10 [0·04–0·22]; p < 0·001) hybrid immunity were associated with a lower risk of COVID-19 hospitalisation than natural immunity.

Interpretation

The risk of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection and COVID-19 hospitalisation in individuals who have survived and recovered from a previous infection remained low for up to 20 months. Vaccination seemed to further decrease the risk of both outcomes for up to 9 months, although the differences in absolute numbers, especially in hospitalisations, were small. These findings suggest that if passports are used for societal restrictions, they should acknowledge either a previous infection or vaccination as proof of immunity, as opposed to vaccination only.

### Impact of the influenza vaccine on COVID-19 infection rates and severity [^1154ee51]. American Journal of Infection Control (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

With a unique influenza season occurring in the midst of a pandemic, there is interest in assessing the role of the influenza vaccine in COVID-19 susceptibility and severity.

Methods

In this retrospective cohort study, patients receiving a laboratory test for COVID-19 were identified. The primary outcome was comparison of positive COVID-19 testing in those who received the influenza vaccine versus those who did not. Secondary end points in patients testing positive for COVID-19 included mortality, need for hospitalization, length of stay, need for intensive care, and mechanical ventilation.

Results

A total of 27,201 patients received laboratory testing for COVID-19. The odds of testing positive for COVID-19 was reduced in patients who received an influenza vaccine compared to those who did not (odds ratio 0.76, 95% CI 0.68–0.86; P < .001). Vaccinated patients testing positive for COVID-19 were less likely to require hospitalization (odds ratio, 0.58, 95% CI 0.46–0.73; P < .001), or mechanical ventilation (odds ratio, 0.45, 95% CI 0.27–0.78; P = 0.004) and had a shorter hospital length of stay (risk ratio, 0.76, 95% CI 0.65–0.89; P < .001).

Conclusion

Influenza vaccination is associated with decreased positive COVID-19 testing and improved clinical outcomes and should be promoted to reduce the burden of COVID-19.

### Persistence in risk and effect of COVID-19 vaccination on long-term health consequences after SARS-CoV-2 infection [^c75b1277]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

This study examined the progressive risk of acute and post-acute sequelae following SARS-CoV-2 infection at 3 monthly intervals up to a year amongst patients with different vaccination status. The risk of clinical sequelae was observed to reduce gradually over the observation period. Complete vaccination and the uptake of booster dose of COVID-19 vaccines were found to further reduce the risk and persistence in risk of long-term health consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The findings of this study indicated a lesser disease burden caused by health consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to that reported in earlier study and provided real-world evidence supporting the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines in reducing the risk of long-term health consequences following infection.

### The relationship of COVID-19 vaccination with mortality among 86, 732 hospitalized patients: subpopulations, patient factors, and changes over time [^be4afbfa]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

The Analysis Sample

Overall, 75.2% (n = 65,192) of the sample had both a positive PCR test result and a COVID ICD-10 diagnosis, 5.4% (n = 4,706) had only a positive PCR test, and 19.4% (n = 16,834) had only a COVID ICD-10 diagnosis at the time of hospitalization. Variation in diagnostic indicators may have been due to prioritization of medical intervention and some clinicians' sense that multiple indicators or COVID-19 were not necessary. A total of 22,792 patients (26%) had received one or more COVID-19 vaccinations (Table 1).

Participants per Health System

The number of analysis sample patients from each of the 21 participating health systems ranged from 263 to 11,652 (mean = 4130 patients, SD = 3352; median = 2817). Patients had a mean of 10.32 (SD = 17.79) encounters with the healthcare system prior to the index hospitalization.

Characteristics of the Sample and Vaccination Rates

The characteristics of the patients across the 21 health systems are depicted in Table 1.

Vaccination Status of the Sample

S Figure 2 presents the rates at which patients were vaccinated across the 12 months of the study period using both the binary and the continuous vaccination variables. Less than half the sample had received any vaccination by the final month and only about 10% had received a 3rd dose by that time. Patterns of vaccine uptake (observed, not covariate adjusted) over time for the binary vaccination variable are depicted for the different covariate populations in S Figures 3–9.

Analyses of rates of vaccination (binary) as a function of covariate population and time were conducted via simultaneous entry of all covariates (S Table 2). There was a significant main effect reflecting overall increases in vaccination rates over time. Groups especially likely to be vaccinated were patients over 60 years of age, males, those on Medicare, and those with higher comorbidity scores (see S Figures 3–9). Groups especially unlikely to be vaccinated were Black patients, Hispanic patients, the severely obese, and those receiving Medicaid or who had missing or other insurance status. Interaction tests between time and covariate groups showed that some groups exhibited especially large increases in vaccination receipt over time, e.g. Black, Asian, and Hispanic individuals (see S Figures 3–9).

How to approach a patient when considering pharmacologic treatments for COVID-19 — this section discusses how to approach a patient suspected to have COVID-19 and how to apply the IDSA COVID-19 treatment guidelines to specific clinical syndromes. The guideline notes that the certainty of supporting evidence is low to moderate for most recommendations and that the panel made conditional suggestions rather than strong recommendations for or against most of the agents. It further states that though substantial progress was made with COVID-19 therapies, there remain many unanswered questions in the management of COVID-19, and that despite limited evidence, to give actionable and timely guidance to frontline clinicians, it provides recommendations for use of combinations of agents, recommends some agents over others, or extrapolates to sub populations not evaluated in trials. Critical unanswered questions identified include which sub-populations or specific clinical types of patients benefit most from specific therapeutic agents, what the efficacy and safety of COVID-19 therapies are in populations immune from prior SARS-CoV-2 infections and vaccination, what the efficacy and safety of treatments are in infections with specific SARS-CoV-2 variants and sub-variants, and how therapeutic agents perform when compared to each other to allow a tiered approach to treating patients with COVID-19.

### SARS-CoV-2 infection and hospitalization among adults aged ≥ 18 years, by vaccination status, before and during SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.529 (omicron) variant predominance-los angeles county, California, November 7, 2021-January 8, 2022 [^87e84540]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2022). Medium credibility.

COVID-19 vaccines are effective at preventing infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, as well as severe COVID-19-associated outcomes in real-world conditions (1,2). The risks for SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19-associated hospitalization are lower among fully vaccinated than among unvaccinated persons; this reduction is even more pronounced among those who have received additional or booster doses (boosters) (3,4). Although the B.1.1.529 (Omicron) variant spreads more rapidly than did earlier SARS-CoV-2 variants, recent studies suggest that disease severity is lower for Omicron compared with that associated with the B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant; but the high volume of infections is straining the health care system more than did previous waves (5).*, † The Los Angeles County (LAC) Department of Public Health (LACDPH) used COVID-19 surveillance and California Immunization Registry 2 (CAIR2) data to describe age-adjusted 14-day cumulative incidence and hospitalization rates during November 7, 2021-January 8, 2022, by COVID-19 vaccination status and variant predominance. For the 14-day period ending December 11, 2021, the last week of Delta predominance, the incidence and hospitalization rates among unvaccinated persons were 12.3 and 83.0 times, respectively, those of fully vaccinated persons with a booster and 3.8 and 12.9 times, respectively, those of fully vaccinated persons without a booster. These rate ratios were lower during Omicron predominance (week ending January 8, 2022), with unvaccinated persons having infection and hospitalization rates 3.6 and 23.0 times, respectively, those of fully vaccinated persons with a booster and 2.0 and 5.3 times, respectively, those of fully vaccinated persons without a booster. In addition, during the entire analytic period, admission to intensive care units (ICUs), intubation for mechanical ventilation, and death were more likely to occur among unvaccinated persons than among fully vaccinated persons without or with a booster (p < 0.001). Incidence and hospitalization rates were consistently highest for unvaccinated persons and lowest for fully vaccinated persons with a booster. Being up to date with COVID-19 vaccination is critical to protecting against SARS-CoV-2 infection and associated hospitalization.

### Time to establish an international vaccine candidate pool for potential highly infectious respiratory disease: a community's view [^d8201cd1]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Mitigating the impact of an infectious disease pandemic entails the availability of effective vaccines that can reduce disease severity and prevent deaths. By the end of 2022, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) claimed almost 7 million lives around the world, with the death rate being substantially higher during the first disease wave substantially higher during the first disease wave, prior to vaccine availability. In particular, the death rate declined from 5.7% during the first wave to approximately 1.7% during the second and third waves second and third waves in developed countries, when vaccines became available when vaccines became available and the later variants, Omicron and Delta, caused significantly less morbidity and mortality. Evidence suggests a 60%–90% decline in severity following vaccination, and that vaccination remains the safest and best tool for protecting against COVID-19-related hospitalization and death, irrespective of previous infection status. Once vaccines were available, they averted an estimated 20 million deaths from COVID-19. Widespread vaccination is also expected to reduce the economic burden of the disease and its impact on social liberties, and the likelihood of the emergence of immune escape virus variants. Among all pandemic diseases, air transmissible respiratory diseases are the most contagious and difficult to contain. The critical question is thus how to make vaccines available as early as possible during future similar or even more severe pandemics.

### Persistence in risk and effect of COVID-19 vaccination on long-term health consequences after SARS-CoV-2 infection [^961ebe84]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Overall, a graded reduction in the risk of clinical sequelae among infected patients was observed over time and with the increased number of doses of COVID-19 vaccines received prior to infection. Compared to non-infected controls, patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection were observed to incur a greater risk of clinical sequelae including major cardiovascular diseases [HR dose = 0: 4.64 (4.00, 5.38); dose = 1: 3.13 (2.60, 3.76); dose = 2: 2.53 (2.21, 2.89); dose ≥ 3: 1.99 (1.72, 2.29)], and all-cause mortality [HR dose = 0: 18.89 (18.07, 19.74); dose = 1: 8.96 (8.46, 9.48); dose = 2: 3.95 (3.71, 4.20); dose ≥ 3: 1.74 (1.50, 2.02)] across patients with different COVID-19 vaccination status during the acute phase of infection. A graded decrease in risk was observed in patients with a greater number of doses of COVID-19 vaccination with unvaccinated and incompletely vaccinated patients incurring a greater risk of most clinical sequelae than those completely vaccinated and those who received booster doses of vaccines. Most notably, there was an approximately five-fold reduction in risk of all-cause mortality between unvaccinated patients (18.89; 18.07,19.74) and patients with complete vaccination (3.95; 3.71, 4.20) during the acute phase of infection. Such risk was further reduced amongst patients who received booster dose of vaccines (1.74; 1.50, 2.02).

Infectious Diseases Society of America COVID-19 molecular diagnostic testing — evidence certainty and research needs — notes that the level of certainty of evidence to support a recommendation of NAAT for symptomatic individuals suspected of having COVID-19 was deemed very low in 2021 and moderate today, and that most recommendations in this guideline are conditional, with very low or low certainty of evidence to support them. Evidence is especially sparse or of poor quality for performance of tests in children, immunocompromised individuals, those vaccinated or infected previously with SARS-CoV-2, and persons infected with newer variants such as Omicron. Research needs recognized by the panel include identifying a laboratory marker of infectiousness to guide release from isolation, studying the value of testing for asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection at the time of hospitalization or before a medical or surgical procedure, obtaining additional data on the accuracy of home testing and on testing specimen sources other than NP swabs, and determining clinical test performance in prospective multicenter studies using a well-defined reference standard; Table 9 outlines the type of clinical studies needed to address key diagnostic knowledge gaps.

### Trends in COVID-19 hospital outcomes in england before and after vaccine introduction, a cohort study [^cd882dfb]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

There is now compelling evidence that vaccination reduces the number of individuals being hospitalisedand the risk of mortality, regardless of hospital admission. We found reduced hospitalised fatality among vaccinated individuals, with the reduction most clearly seen among older individuals. For those aged 75 and over, vaccination reduced HFR to approximately the risk of an unvaccinated individual aged 10 years younger. In adjusted estimates, each additional vaccine dose reduced the hazard for fatality by a significant margin, with a 42% (38–46%) estimated reduction in the risk of death for double-vaccinated individuals. This is a slightly lower reduction than for all community-acquired PCR-positive COVID-19 cases in England, where a 51% (37–62%) reduced risk of death was estimated for symptomatic individuals who had received a single vaccine. This difference may reflect the portion of hospitalised individuals who die from other causes, or could be an indication of waning vaccine efficacy among our study population.

After controlling for all measured covariates, including hospital load and vaccination, we continued to estimate monthly variation in outcomes, with apparent seasonal variation in hazards. Whilst seasonal patterns in respiratory pathogens such as influenza and respiratory syncytial virus are well-documented, a multitude of interlinked factors including changes in national restrictions and the emergence of new variants may have influenced these trends.

### Factors influencing estimated effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines in non-randomised studies [^bbefe381]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Disease risk factor confounding

The vaccinated group may have a higher background risk of developing severe disease after infection compared with the unvaccinated group, if vaccination has been prioritised for people at higher risk of COVID-19 consequences (older age, presence of comorbidities). Early deployment of COVID-19 vaccines in most countries used such priority rules. The opposite situation may also happen, if some extremely high-risk people are preferentially left unvaccinated, for example, if people with terminal illness are spared vaccination because of perceived futility or because of concern about potential vaccine adverse effects with extreme frailty. Adjusting for age and sex, people who choose to be vaccinated are often far more healthy ('healthy vaccinee effect'), for example, in a US study, vaccinated people had markedly decreased risk of dying from non-COVID-19 causes (adjusted relative risk 0.34–0.54). Matched designs, standard multivariable adjustments, propensity matching, instrumental variables and more complex causal modelling may be used with variable success each time, depending on how well confounders are known, measured and incorporated in the modelling.

Hospital admission decision and treatment use

The vaccinated group may have a higher chance of being admitted to the hospital, if their socioeconomic and demographic profile is such that it leads to better access to and coverage of hospital care than the unvaccinated group and/or if more serious background risk leads to hospital admission more readily. Conversely, the unvaccinated group may have a higher chance to be admitted in the hospital, if for the same clinical presentation and other things being equal, there is a perception that lack of vaccination portends serious outcomes. Hospital admission may then also affect the risk of death. All these considerations are speculative, and one needs to probe empirically if such biases exist in different circumstances and settings. Similar reasons may lead to differential access to and use of treatment modalities that may affect hard outcomes. Biases could also arise from counting people admitted with a COVID-19-positive test versus people admitted due to COVID-19.

* Fully vaccinated adolescents with COVID-19–associated hospitalizations were defined as those who had received the final dose in their primary series ≥ 14 days before receiving a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result associated with their hospitalization. Adolescents who received only 1 vaccine dose ≥ 14 days before the SARS-CoV-2 test date or had received a single dose of vaccine < 14 days before the positive SARS-CoV-2 test results were considered partially vaccinated; they were not included in rates and were grouped with unvaccinated adolescents in other analyses. COVID-NET sites, through agreements with state health departments and other partners, collect COVID-19 vaccination information on COVID-19–associated hospitalizations through state-based vaccine registries.

### A systematic review and meta-analysis of the impact of vaccination on prevention of long COVID [^9d53805d]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

In summary, our findings support recent evidence suggesting that primary course vaccination and, to a greater extent, booster vaccination prior to SARS-CoV-2 infection may reduce the risk of long COVID symptoms. Further, a systematic literature review currently under peer-review has reported that existing data on COVID-19 vaccination in adults demonstrates that the effect of vaccination prior to infection on long COVID occurs regardless of the predominant variant in circulation.

Factors affecting long COVID risk

A recent cohort study of 441,583 veterans from the Department of Veterans Affairs Health Care System databases by Xie et al. reported 5.23 fewer long COVID events per 100 persons at 1 year post infection during the Omicron era versus during the pre-Delta and Delta eras combined. Furthermore, it was estimated that 28% of the reduction in long COVID events was attributable to viral era-related changes, with the remaining attributable to the effect of vaccination. These findings demonstrate that the incidence of long COVID in the Omicron era remains substantial.

For the data presented here, it cannot be determined whether the protective effect of vaccination against long COVID arises solely from a reduced risk of infection and severe disease (population-level) or whether this can occur irrespective of acute disease severity. Severe COVID-19, as determined by hospitalization or intensive care unit admittance, is among the strongest predictors for the risk of developing long COVID. It follows that, by effectively reducing the incidence of severe COVID-19, vaccination may, in turn, prevent progression to long COVID, thus achieving a protective effect. The impact of repeated SARS-CoV-2 infection on the risk of developing long COVID has not been fully elucidated. While some studies indicate that previous infection with SARS-CoV-2 may decrease the risk of long COVID after a second infection, there is also evidence to suggest that reinfection leads to a cumulative increased risk of long COVID.

### Incidence and predictors of clinical failure after early treatment for mild-to-moderate COVID-19 in high-risk individuals: a multicentric cohort study [^1f981143]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

At the end of 2019, a novel coronavirus designated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2), rapidly spread throughout the world, resulting in a global pandemic with over 750 million confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19). The spectrum of COVID‐19 disease in adults ranges from asymptomatic infection to mild respiratory tract symptoms to severe pneumonia. The risk of severe illness varies by age, underlying comorbidities, immunity due to prior SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and vaccination status. Additionally, viral variants have been associated with heterogeneous risks of severe disease, estimated as lower with Omicron. The management of COVID‐19 in the outpatient setting during the early phases of the acute infection and the correct identification of individuals at increased risk for hospitalization or death are crucial to prevent disease progression. Early treatment with antivirals or monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) remains a high priority in high‐risk, not‐hospitalized patients, as reported by national and international recommendations, albeit with some differences according to specific country. Although, at the present state of the pandemic, the spread of vaccination and the lower pathogenicity of the current SARS‐CoV‐2 variants have drastically reduced the rate of COVID‐19‐related complications, there are restricted categories of individuals who remain at risk of disease progression, even after receiving prompt treatment. There is a lack of real‐world data aimed to identify these specific subgroups, which can help detect people at greater risk of progression to severe disease and death and inform guidelines for COVID‐19 early treatment strategies and vaccination programs in fragile populations in the Omicron era.

In our real‐life cohort of high‐risk individuals early treated with antivirals or mAbs over a period covering a range of SARS‐CoV‐2 variants of concern (VoCs), we aimed to estimate the risk of hospitalization and death in this target population and identify factors associated with the risk of progression to severe COVID‐19 disease.

### Effectiveness of a single COVID-19 mRNA vaccine dose in individuals with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection: a systematic review [^2e00818f]. Communications Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

We found that among individuals with a history of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, a single COVID-19 mRNA vaccine dose provided significant added protection against infection, symptomatic infection, hospitalization, and hospitalization or death on top of the protection acquired from natural infection alone during both pre-Omicron and Omicron predominance periods –. Effectiveness for one dose plus prior SARS-CoV-2 infection was comparable to protection following two doses plus prior infection, and was higher than protection following two doses without prior infection. While other reviews have summarized COVID-19 VE of multiple doses in individuals with a history of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection –, to our knowledge this is the first systematic review to summarize the effectiveness of a single dose of mRNA vaccine.

Single dose VE for the original vaccine plus prior infection tended to be higher during the pre-Omicron period than the Omicron period against infection and symptomatic infection. This observation is consistent with VE estimates for two and three doses of original vaccine and may be explained by a better match of vaccine composition to circulating variants or less waning of immunity in pre-Omicron periods –. Further research is needed to better understand the protection provided by a single dose, particularly for updated formulations of COVID-19 mRNA vaccine, in the current (2023 and onwards) setting of high population-level immunity to SARS-CoV-2 globally.

We did not find any studies that estimated single dose VE among children aged < 5 years with history of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. Considering only 9% of children aged < 2 years and 11% of children aged 2–4 years have received ≥ 1 COVID-19 vaccine dose in the United States as of May 2023, this finding was not unexpected. For older children and adolescents, the available evidence supports the effectiveness of one dose plus prior infection against infection and symptomatic infection, although no data were available for hospitalization or severe outcomes.

IDSA COVID-19 serologic testing — summary statement and benefits/harms note that the overall quality of evidence was very low because of risk of bias, indirectness, and imprecision, and it is unclear if patient outcomes are any different because of testing; it is therefore unclear if serologic testing provides any benefit for patient care decisions or to patients. Anti–SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests help identify people who may have been infected or were vaccinated, but a universal antibody level predictive of protection from reinfection after infection or vaccination has not been identified. The panel did not identify any benefits to antibody testing in most individuals to inform management decisions, though there may be selected scenarios for immunocompromised hosts where serologic testing could be considered, such as patients with symptomatic COVID-19 and significant humoral immune impairment being evaluated for treatment with convalescent plasma.

### Interim estimates of 2024–2025 COVID-19 vaccine… [^194d0c01]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Among adults aged ≥ 18 years, VE against COVID-19–associated ED/UC visits was 33% during the first 7–119 days after vaccination. Among immunocompetent adults aged ≥ 65 years from two CDC networks, VE estimates against COVID-19–associated hospitalization were 45% and 46% during the first 7–119 days after vaccination. Among adults aged ≥ 65 years with immunocompromising conditions in one network, VE was 40% during the first 7–119 days after vaccination. These findings demonstrate that vaccination with a 2024–2025 COVID-19 vaccine dose provides additional protection against COVID-19–associated ED/UC encounters and hospitalizations compared with not receiving a 2024–2025 dose and support current CDC and ACIP recommendations that all persons aged ≥ 6 months receive a 2024–2025 COVID-19 vaccine dose.

This analysis estimated 2024–2025 COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness against COVID-19–associated emergency department or urgent care visits in one CDC-funded VE network and VE against COVID-19–associated hospitalization in two CDC-funded VE networks during September 2024–January 2025 among adults aged ≥ 18 years. Among adults aged ≥ 65 years without immunocompromising conditions in VISION, 26, 219 hospitalizations met criteria for inclusion in analyses, including 2, 248 case-patients and 23, 971 control patients. VE of a 2024–2025 COVID-19 vaccine dose against COVID-19–associated hospitalization was 45% a median interval of 53 days since receipt of a 2024–2025 COVID-19 vaccine dose. Among adults aged ≥ 65 years without immunocompromising conditions in the IVY network, 1, 929 met inclusion criteria, including 683 case-patients and 1, 246 control patients.

VE against COVID-19–associated hospitalization was 46%, a median of 60 days after receipt of a 2024–2025 COVID-19 vaccine dose.

### Incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, emergency department visits, and hospitalizations because of COVID-19 among persons aged ≥ 12 years, by COVID-19 vaccination status-Oregon and Washington, July 4-September 25, 2021 [^12820e8d]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2021). Medium credibility.

Population-based rates of infection with SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) and related health care utilization help determine estimates of COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness and averted illnesses, especially since the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant began circulating in June 2021. Among members aged ≥ 12 years of a large integrated health care delivery system in Oregon and Washington, incidence of laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, emergency department (ED) visits, and hospitalizations were calculated by COVID-19 vaccination status, vaccine product, age, race, and ethnicity. Infection after full vaccination was defined as a positive SARS-CoV-2 molecular test result ≥ 14 days after completion of an authorized COVID-19 vaccination series.* During the July-September 2021 surveillance period, SARS-CoV-2 infection occurred among 4,146 of 137,616 unvaccinated persons (30.1 per 1,000 persons) and 3,009 of 344,848 fully vaccinated persons (8.7 per 1,000). Incidence was higher among unvaccinated persons than among vaccinated persons across all demographic strata. Unvaccinated persons with SARS-CoV-2 infection were more than twice as likely to receive ED care (18.5%) or to be hospitalized (9.0%) than were vaccinated persons with COVID-19 (8.1% and 3.9%, respectively). The crude mortality rate was also higher among unvaccinated patients (0.43 per 1,000) than in fully vaccinated patients (0.06 per 1,000). These data support CDC recommendations for COVID-19 vaccination, including additional and booster doses, to protect individual persons and communities against COVID-19, including illness and hospitalization caused by the Delta variant (1).

Table 35 — Assessment of clinical severity of COVID-19 to target treatments — states that diagnostic classification of severity helps target specific treatments and that "The clinician should identify which of the severity categories in Table 35 the patient falls into." Categories are: mild-to-moderate COVID-19 (SpO2 ≥ 94% on room air and not needing supplemental oxygen) with risk factors for progression to severe disease, hospitalization or death; severe but not critical COVID-19 (SpO2 < 94% on room air or needing low-flow supplemental oxygen); critical COVID-19 needing high-flow oxygen/ or non-invasive ventilation; and critical COVID-19 needing mechanical ventilation or ECMO (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation). The footnote lists risk factors including age > 60 years, BMI > 25, diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, chronic lung disease, cancer, or immunocompromised patients, and notes that risk factors for progression are changing as the epidemic evolves with new variants, vaccination, and previous infection rates.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on the diagnosis of COVID-19: serologic testing [^5f000a4b]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

IDSA COVID-19 serologic testing — studies assessing vaccination identified 10 postvaccination studies including 6 cohort studies, 1 clinical trial, 1 systematic review, and 2 case control studies evaluating binding antibody level and SARS-CoV-2 breakthrough infection. Results were inconsistent: 5 studies reported a correlation between seropositivity and decreased infection rates, whereas 2 reported no difference between those who had seroconverted after vaccination and those who had not. The number of breakthrough infections in some studies was small and several studies focused on immunocompromised populations. The presence of nAbs appears to correlate with protection against breakthrough infection, but a single titer or threshold antibody level predictive of protection has not been identified; quantitative results are not commutable across assays unless calibrated to a common reference standard, and no studies measured the predictive value of hybrid immunity.

### Reduced risk of reinfection with SARS-CoV-2 after COVID-19 vaccination-Kentucky, may-June 2021 [^81edde9e]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2021). Medium credibility.

Although laboratory evidence suggests that antibody responses following COVID-19 vaccination provide better neutralization of some circulating variants than does natural infection (1,2), few real-world epidemiologic studies exist to support the benefit of vaccination for previously infected persons. This report details the findings of a case-control evaluation of the association between vaccination and SARS-CoV-2 reinfection in Kentucky during May-June 2021 among persons previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 in 2020. Kentucky residents who were not vaccinated had 2.34 times the odds of reinfection compared with those who were fully vaccinated (odds ratio [OR] = 2.34; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.58–3.47). These findings suggest that among persons with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, full vaccination provides additional protection against reinfection. To reduce their risk of infection, all eligible persons should be offered vaccination, even if they have been previously infected with SARS-CoV-2.

### COVID-19-associated hospitalizations among U.S. adults aged ≥ 65 years-COVID-NET, 13 States, January-August 2023 [^f24305ba]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2023). Medium credibility.

Adults aged ≥ 65 years remain at elevated risk for severe COVID-19 disease and have higher COVID-19-associated hospitalization rates compared with those in younger age groups. Data from the COVID-19-Associated Hospitalization Surveillance Network (COVID-NET) were analyzed to estimate COVID-19-associated hospitalization rates during January-August 2023 and identify demographic and clinical characteristics of hospitalized patients aged ≥ 65 years during January-June 2023. Among adults aged ≥ 65 years, hospitalization rates more than doubled, from 6.8 per 100,000 during the week ending July 15 to 16.4 per 100,000 during the week ending August 26, 2023. Across all age groups, adults aged ≥ 65 years accounted for 62.9% (95% CI = 60.1%-65.7%) of COVID-19-associated hospitalizations, 61.3% (95% CI = 54.7%-67.6%) of intensive care unit admissions, and 87.9% (95% CI = 80.5%-93.2%) of in-hospital deaths associated with COVID-19 hospitalizations. Most hospitalized adults aged ≥ 65 years (90.3%; 95% CI = 87.2%-92.8%) had multiple underlying conditions, and fewer than one quarter (23.5%; 95% CI = 19.5%-27.7%) had received the recommended COVID-19 bivalent vaccine. Because adults aged ≥ 65 years remain at increased risk for COVID-19-associated hospitalization and severe outcomes, guidance for this age group should continue to focus on measures to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection, encourage vaccination, and promote early treatment for persons who receive a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result to reduce their risk for severe COVID-19-associated outcomes.

### Clinical epidemiology and risk factors for critical outcomes among vaccinated and unvaccinated adults hospitalized with COVID-19-VISION network, 10 States, June 2021-March 2023 [^13518a1a]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The epidemiology of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) continues to develop with emerging variants, expanding population-level immunity, and advances in clinical care. We describe changes in the clinical epidemiology of COVID-19 hospitalizations and risk factors for critical outcomes over time.

Methods

We included adults aged ≥ 18 years from 10 states hospitalized with COVID-19 June 2021-March 2023. We evaluated changes in demographics, clinical characteristics, and critical outcomes (intensive care unit admission and/or death) and evaluated critical outcomes risk factors (risk ratios [RRs]), stratified by COVID-19 vaccination status.

Results

A total of 60 488 COVID-19-associated hospitalizations were included in the analysis. Among those hospitalized, median age increased from 60 to 75 years, proportion vaccinated increased from 18.2% to 70.1%, and critical outcomes declined from 24.8% to 19.4% (all P < .001) between the Delta (June-December, 2021) and post-BA.4/BA.5 (September 2022-March 2023) periods. Hospitalization events with critical outcomes had a higher proportion of ≥ 4 categories of medical condition categories assessed (32.8%) compared to all hospitalizations (23.0%). Critical outcome risk factors were similar for unvaccinated and vaccinated populations; presence of ≥ 4 medical condition categories was most strongly associated with risk of critical outcomes regardless of vaccine status (unvaccinated: adjusted RR, 2.27 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 2.14–2.41]; vaccinated: adjusted RR, 1.73 [95% CI, 1.56–1.92]) across periods.

Conclusions

The proportion of adults hospitalized with COVID-19 who experienced critical outcomes decreased with time, and median patient age increased with time. Multimorbidity was most strongly associated with critical outcomes.

The impact of coronavirus disease 2019 vaccination on viral characteristics of breakthrough infections is unknown. In this prospective cohort study, incidence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection decreased following vaccination. Although asymptomatic positive tests were observed following vaccination, the higher cycle thresholds, repeat negative tests, and inability to culture virus raise questions about their clinical significance.

### Trends in COVID-19 hospital outcomes in england before and after vaccine introduction, a cohort study [^eeb058d0]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Widespread vaccination campaigns have changed the landscape for COVID-19, vastly altering symptoms and reducing morbidity and mortality. We estimate trends in mortality by month of admission and vaccination status among those hospitalised with COVID-19 in England between March 2020 to September 2021, controlling for demographic factors and hospital load. Among 259,727 hospitalised COVID-19 cases, 51,948 (20.0%) experienced mortality in hospital. Hospitalised fatality risk ranged from 40.3% (95% confidence interval 39.4–41.3%) in March 2020 to 8.1% (7.2–9.0%) in June 2021. Older individuals and those with multiple co-morbidities were more likely to die or else experienced longer stays prior to discharge. Compared to unvaccinated people, the hazard of hospitalised mortality was 0.71 (0.67–0.77) with a first vaccine dose, and 0.56 (0.52–0.61) with a second vaccine dose. Compared to hospital load at 0–20% of the busiest week, the hazard of hospitalised mortality during periods of peak load (90–100%), was 1.23 (1.12–1.34). The prognosis for people hospitalised with COVID-19 in England has varied substantially throughout the pandemic and according to case-mix, vaccination, and hospital load. Our estimates provide an indication for demands on hospital resources, and the relationship between hospital burden and outcomes.

### Changes in infectivity, severity and vaccine effectiveness against delta COVID-19 variant ten months into the vaccination program: the Israeli case [^e137b5a2]. Preventive Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

We present epidemiological data to examine trends in COVID-19 incidence, morbidity and mortality in Israel as well as changes in vaccine effectiveness, and discuss the impact of the delta variant and the third, "booster", vaccine. A retrospective-archive study was conducted from February 27th 2020 to October 16th, 2021. Data were obtained from the Israeli Ministry of Health's open COVID 19 database, including PCR-confirmed cases, number hospitalized - including severe cases, death rate, all by age and vaccination status, case fatality rate and changing effectiveness of the vaccine. After three COVID waves, confirmed cases rose from under 30 new daily cases in mid-June to a high of 11,000 in early September 2021. Severe hospitalized cases and death rates were lower than in previous waves and largely restricted to those not fully vaccinated. In the first three months of the vaccination campaign, non-vaccinated population demonstrated much higher morbidity rates. Four months after vaccination began, this gap was attenuated, with low rates of infection and hospitalization in all groups. The gap was regained following uptake of the third vaccine. Data from the fourth wave show reduced hospitalizations and mortality compared to previous waves and suggest that this may be related to high vaccine coverage. These trends suggest that countries with high vaccination might adopt a more permissive approach towards COVID even in the face of new variants.

### The unintended consequences of COVID-19 vaccine policy: why mandates, passports and restrictions may cause more harm than good [^07e2aa5c]. BMJ Global Health (2022). High credibility.

Table 1
The global turn towards mandatory COVID-19 proof-of-vaccination policies*

The publicly communicated rationale for implementing such policies has shifted over time. Early messaging around COVID-19 vaccination as a public health response measure focused on protecting the most vulnerable. This quickly shifted to vaccination thresholds to reach herd immunity and 'end the pandemic' and 'get back to normal' once sufficient vaccine supply was available. In late summer of 2021, this pivoted again to a universal vaccination recommendation to reduce hospital/intensive care unit (ICU) burden in Europe and North America, to address the 'pandemic of the unvaccinated'.

COVID-19 vaccines have represented a critical intervention during the pandemic given consistent data of vaccine effectiveness averting COVID-19-related morbidity and mortality. However, the scientific rationale for blanket mandatory vaccine policies has been increasingly challenged due to waning sterilising immunity and emerging variants of concern. A growing body of evidence shows significant waning effectiveness against infection (and transmission) at 12–16 weeks, with both Delta and Omicron variants, including with third-dose shots. Since early reports of post-vaccination transmission in mid-2021, it has become clear that vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals, once infected, transmit to others at similar rates. Vaccine effectiveness may also be lower in younger age groups. While higher rates of hospitalisation and COVID-19-associated morbidity and mortality can indeed be observed among the unvaccinated across all age groups, broad-stroke passport and mandate policies do not seem to recognise the extreme risk differential across populations (benefits are greatest in older adults), are often justified on the basis of reducing transmission and, in many countries, ignore the protective role of prior infection.

### Persistent COVID-19 symptoms at 6 months after onset and the role of vaccination before or after SARS-CoV-2 infection [^57a72dc4]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Conclusions

In this cohort study, more severe acute COVID-19 illness, a higher CCI score, and being unvaccinated prior to infection were associated with a higher risk of reporting 28 or more days of COVID-19 symptoms, and participants with COVID-19 were more likely to seek medical care for diabetes, pulmonary, neurology, and mental health–related diagnoses for at least 6 months after COVID-19 onset compared with their pre–COVID-19 health care use patterns. Our findings suggest that PCCs present a major burden to patients and the health care systems that treat them. Our observational data offer further evidence that postinfection vaccination may mitigate PCCs. Taken together, these findings may inform the risk-benefit ratio of COVID-19 vaccination policy.

### SARS-CoV-2 infections and hospitalizations among persons aged ≥ 16 years, by vaccination status-los angeles county, California, may 1-July 25, 2021 [^6a02d15b]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2021). Medium credibility.

COVID-19 vaccines fully approved or currently authorized for use through Emergency Use Authorization from the Food and Drug Administration are critical tools for controlling the COVID-19 pandemic; however, even with highly effective vaccines, a proportion of fully vaccinated persons will become infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. To characterize postvaccination infections, the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health (LACDPH) used COVID-19 surveillance and California Immunization Registry 2 (CAIR2) data to describe age-adjusted infection and hospitalization rates during May 1–July 25, 2021, by vaccination status. Whole genome sequencing (WGS)–based SARS-CoV-2 lineages and cycle threshold (Ct) values from qualitative reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for two SARS-CoV-2 gene targets, including the nucleocapsid (N) protein gene region and the open reading frame 1 ab (ORF1ab) polyprotein gene region, * were reported for a convenience sample of specimens. Among 43,127 reported SARS-CoV-2 infections in Los Angeles County residents aged ≥ 16 years, 10,895 (25.3%) were in fully vaccinated persons, 1,431 (3.3%) were in partially vaccinated persons, and 30,801 (71.4%) were in unvaccinated persons. Much lower percentages of fully vaccinated persons infected with SARS-CoV-2 were hospitalized (3.2%), were admitted to an intensive care unit (0.5%), and required mechanical ventilation (0.2%) compared with partially vaccinated persons (6.2%, 1.0%, and 0.3%, respectively) and unvaccinated persons (7.6%, 1.5%, and 0.5%, respectively) (p < 0.001 for all comparisons). On July 25, the SARS-CoV-2 infection rate among unvaccinated persons was 4.9 times and the hospitalization rate was 29.2 times the rates among fully vaccinated persons. During May 1–July 25, the percentages of B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant infections estimated from 6,752 samples with lineage data increased among fully vaccinated persons (from 8.6% to 91.2%), partially vaccinated persons (from 0% to 88.1%), and unvaccinated persons (from 8.2% to 87.1%). In May, there were differences in median Ct values by vaccination status; however, by July, no differences were detected among specimens from fully vaccinated, partially vaccinated, and unvaccinated persons by gene targets. These infection and hospitalization rate data indicate that authorized vaccines were protective against SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe COVID-19 during a period when transmission of the Delta variant was increasing. Efforts to increase COVID-19 vaccination, in coordination with other prevention strategies, are critical to preventing COVID-19–related hospitalizations and deaths.

### The effect of COVID-19 vaccination on the risk of persistent post-COVID-19 condition: cohort study [^561cd0ec]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

The natural history of post–coronavirus disease 2019 condition (PCC) is poorly understood. We have previously shown that a PCC diagnosis correlates with excess health care usage in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)–infected individuals, indicating a good accuracy of the diagnosis for severe PCC, and a Swedish cohort study found an association between coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination and a reduced risk of being diagnosed with PCC. Whether COVID-19 vaccination also influences the risk of experiencing long-term, persistent PCC remains to be understood. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether COVID-19 vaccination was associated with a reduced risk of persistent PCC.

### The Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on the diagnosis of COVID-19: molecular diagnostic testing (December 2023) [^54e6d97c]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

IDSA COVID-19 molecular diagnostics — Recommendation 8 — states that the panel suggests against routine SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) in asymptomatic individuals without a known exposure to COVID-19 who are being hospitalized, with a conditional recommendation and very low certainty evidence. Important considerations include that the IDSA panel was unable to identify studies showing reduced SARS-CoV-2 transmission to healthcare providers or other patients from prehospitalization testing and that the evidence was indirect, assessing only diagnostic test accuracy in studies of symptomatic patients alone or together with asymptomatic patients. Scope notes specify that this recommendation applies only to tests evaluated in the included studies; one test, Abbott IDNow, was included in most of the studies and may have skewed results towards lower sensitivity, evaluated assays used diverse technologies that may theoretically impact results, and limited data were available for immunocompromised or vaccinated individuals, those with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, or those infected with different SARS-CoV-2 variants.

### Persistence in risk and effect of COVID-19 vaccination on long-term health consequences after SARS-CoV-2 infection [^319fdac3]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

This study examined the risk of long-term health consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection involving multiple organ systems between patients with a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection and non-infected controls over the course of 365 days. The findings of this study showed a reduction in the risk of the majority of clinical sequelae over the course of the observation window suggesting the gradual subside of the risk of long-term health consequences over a year. COVID-19 vaccination, especially the uptake of the booster dose, was found to be effective in reducing the risk of health consequences. Patients who received three or more doses of vaccines did not incur any significant risk increased in clinical sequelae from 91 days onwards from their initial infection. On the other hand, unvaccinated patients were at a greater risk of several clinical sequelae including all-cause mortality up to one year following infection. Such findings provided evidence to support the potential protection from vaccination in reducing the risk of long-term health consequences following SARS-CoV-2 infection.

### Protection from COVID-19 mRNA vaccination and prior SARS-CoV-2 infection against COVID-19-associated encounters in adults during delta and omicron predominance [^6f841801]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Data assessing protection conferred from COVID-19 mRNA vaccination and/or prior SARS-CoV-2 infection during Delta and Omicron predominance periods in the United States are limited.

Methods

This cohort study included persons ≥ 18 years who had ≥ 1 health care encounter across 4 health systems and had been tested for SARS-CoV-2 before 26 August 2021. COVID-19 mRNA vaccination and prior SARS-CoV-2 infection defined the exposure. Cox regression estimated hazard ratios (HRs) for the Delta and Omicron periods; protection was calculated as (1-HR)×100%.

Results

Compared to unvaccinated and previously uninfected persons, during Delta predominance, protection against COVID-19-associated hospitalizations was high for those 2- or 3-dose vaccinated and previously infected, 3-dose vaccinated alone, and prior infection alone (range, 91%-97%, with overlapping 95% confidence intervals [CIs]); during Omicron predominance, estimates were lower (range, 77%-90%). Protection against COVID-19-associated emergency department/urgent care (ED/UC) encounters during Delta predominance was high for those exposure groups (range, 86%-93%); during Omicron predominance, protection remained high for those 3-dose vaccinated with or without a prior infection (76%; 95% CI = 67%-83% and 71%; 95% CI = 67%-73%, respectively).

Conclusions

COVID-19 mRNA vaccination and/or prior SARS-CoV-2 infection provided protection against COVID-19-associated hospitalizations and ED/UC encounters regardless of variant. Staying up-to-date with COVID-19 vaccination still provides protection against severe COVID-19 disease, regardless of prior infection.

### Effectiveness associated with vaccination after COVID-19 recovery in preventing reinfection [^3dea117c]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Our findings are consistent with a case-control study by Cavenaugh et alusing surveillance data from Kentucky, which found that being unvaccinated was associated with approximately 2-fold higher odds of reinfection compared with being fully vaccinated. A cohort study by Hammerman et alusing electronic medical record data from Israel estimated VE among people who had recovered from prior COVID-19 to be higher (approximately 60% for those aged ≥ 65 years and 82% for those aged 16–64 years). Another study of health care workers from the United Kingdom found that infection-acquired immunity waned after a year but was consistently higher than 90% for individuals who were subsequently vaccinated. Given that most hospitalizations and fatalities in our cohort were associated with the first infections, we were not able to conduct formal statistical inference about VE associated with preventing more severe reinfections; however, the observed incidence rates of reinfection-associated COVID-19 hospitalization and death were lower among individuals who were vaccinated compared with individuals who were unvaccinated.

Our findings highlight the continued importance of vaccination, including after recovery from prior COVID-19, among LTCC residents and employees, who are likely at increased risk of reinfection owing to their older age and/or greater exposure to the virus in LTCC settings. Employees and some residents or clients of other settings with greater COVID-19 exposure (eg, health care or correctional environments) may similarly experience high risk of reinfection and benefit from vaccination after recovery from COVID-19.

Our study has several key strengths. The database contains statewide information on positive PCR test results, most positive antigen test results, and nearly all vaccine doses administered in Rhode Island during the study period. The database also has information about whether the individual with positive test results is a resident or employee of a LTCC, a critical subpopulation with respect to SARS-COV-2 infection risk. A second major strength is the prospective nature of the analysis: we were able to follow individuals prospectively in time and calculate VE in terms of relative incidence (1 − AHR).

### Reinfection rates among patients who previously tested positive for coronavirus disease 2019: a retrospective cohort study [^edbf3a1b]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Protection afforded from prior disease among patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection is unknown. If infection provides substantial long-lasting immunity, it may be appropriate to reconsider vaccination distribution.

Methods

This retrospective cohort study of 1 health system included 150 325 patients tested for COVID-19 infection via polymerase chain reaction from 12 March 2020 to 30 August 2020. Testing performed up to 24 February 2021 in these patients was included. The main outcome was reinfection, defined as infection ≥ 90 days after initial testing. Secondary outcomes were symptomatic infection and protection of prior infection against reinfection.

Results

Of 150 325 patients, 8845 (5.9%) tested positive and 141 480 (94.1%) tested negative before 30 August. A total of 1278 (14.4%) positive patients were retested after 90 days, and 62 had possible reinfection. Of those, 31 (50%) were symptomatic. Of those with initial negative testing, 5449 (3.9%) were subsequently positive and 3191 of those (58.5%) were symptomatic. Protection offered from prior infection was 81.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] 76.6–85.8) and against symptomatic infection was 84.5% (95% CI, 77.9–89.1). This protection increased over time.

Conclusions

Prior infection in patients with COVID-19 was highly protective against reinfection and symptomatic disease. This protection increased over time, suggesting that viral shedding or ongoing immune response may persist beyond 90 days and may not represent true reinfection. As vaccine supply is limited, patients with known history of COVID-19 could delay early vaccination to allow for the most vulnerable to access the vaccine and slow transmission.

### Monitoring incidence of COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths, by vaccination status-13 U.S. jurisdictions, April 4-July 17, 2021 [^0ef83396]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2021). Medium credibility.

§ To ascertain COVID-19–associated deaths, eight jurisdictions relied upon vital records; and five jurisdictions relied upon a combination of vital records and provider reporting (two), case investigations and vital records (two), and provider reporting, case investigations, and vital records (one). Eleven jurisdictions provided deaths with COVID-19 as a cause; one provided all deaths that occurred within 30 days of becoming a case (without confirming cause); and one provided deaths confirmed with COVID-19 as a cause or within 60 days of positive specimen collection.

¶ Fully vaccinated persons are those who are ≥ 14 days postcompletion of the primary series of an FDA-authorized COVID-19 vaccine. Not fully vaccinated persons are those who did not receive an FDA-authorized COVID-19 vaccine or who received vaccine but are not yet considered fully vaccinated.

 Alabama, Arizona, Colorado, Indiana, Los Angeles County (California), Louisiana, Maryland, Minnesota, New Mexico, New York City (New York), North Carolina, Seattle/King County (Washington), and Utah.

†† Two analysis periods, April 4–June 19 and June 20–July 17, were designated based on the threshold week when the weighted percentage of lineages from whole-genome sequencing results submitted to or performed by CDC reached 50% for the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant across the 13 jurisdictions.

During April 4–June 19, fully vaccinated persons accounted for 5% of cases, 7% of hospitalizations, and 8% of deaths overall; these percentages were higher during June 20–July 17 (18%, 14%, and 16%, respectively). Using the reported 37% vaccination coverage for the 13 jurisdictions during April 4–June 19 and an assumption of 90% VE, vaccinated persons would have been expected to account for 6% of cases (close to the 5% observed). With 53% coverage reported during June 20–July 17, vaccinated persons were expected to account for 10% of cases at a constant VE of 90%; the observed 18% would have been expected at a lower VE of 80%.

### New COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations among adults, by vaccination status-new york, may 3-July 25, 2021 [^72ae6032]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2021). Medium credibility.

§ New hospitalizations were determined by a report of a hospital admission with a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis, entered into the Health Electronic Response Data System, which includes a statewide, daily electronic survey of all inpatient facilities in New York.

¶ Persons were determined to be fully vaccinated following 14 days after final vaccine-series dose receipt, per the Citywide Immunization Registry and the New York State Immunization Information System, which collect and store all COVID-19 vaccine receipt data by providers for persons residing in New York City and the rest of New York, respectively.

New COVID-19 cases among fully vaccinated and unvaccinated adults, vaccine coverage, and estimated vaccine effectiveness, by age — New York, May 3–July 25, 2021

A total of 1,285 new COVID-19 hospitalizations (0.17 per 100,000 person-days) occurred among fully vaccinated adults, compared with 7,288 (1.68 per 100,000 person-days) among unvaccinated adults (Table). Hospitalization rates generally declined through the week of July 5, but increased the weeks of July 12 and July 19, and were higher among fully vaccinated and unvaccinated persons aged ≥ 65 years compared with younger age groups (Figure 2). Age group–specific estimated VE against hospitalization remained stable, ranging from 89.1% to 97.1% for persons aged 18–49 years, from 89.8% to 96.1% for persons aged 50–64 years, and from 86.5% to 94.2% for persons aged ≥ 65 years. During May 3–July 25, the overall, age-adjusted VE against hospitalization was generally stable from 89.5% to 95.1% (Figure 2) (Table). The ratio of hospitalizations to cases was moderately lower among fully vaccinated (13.3 hospitalizations per 100 cases) compared with unvaccinated (17.1 hospitalizations per 100 cases) groups.

### Multisociety statement on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination as a condition of employment for healthcare personnel [^ea2e4b63]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2022). High credibility.

COVID-19 epidemiology and regulatory context in the United States notes that "More than 33 million Americans (> 1 in 10) have been documented to have acquired severe acute respiratory coronavirus virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection," and "More than 600,000 Americans have died from the disease," with the third-wave peak when "nearly 260,000 cases were reported per day and nearly 160,000 COVID-19 patients were hospitalized in the United States each week." For vaccine authorization, "the EUA requires fewer months of safety and efficacy data (typically 2–3 months of experience), whereas full FDA approval requires at least 6 months of data that can be evaluated in detail," and "In the United States, 3 COVID-19 vaccines have been granted EUAs," while "both Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna filed for formal FDA approval in 2021." Policy precedent is that "In the last 15 years, increasing numbers of healthcare organizations have instituted a requirement for receipt of ACIP-recommended vaccines for HCP to reliably and sustainably increase HCP vaccination rates."
