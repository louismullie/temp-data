## Question

Elevated amylase 129 in 26 year old

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to interpret and manage an amylase level of 129 U/L in a 26-year-old, and what steps to take next. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether this value meets diagnostic thresholds for acute pancreatitis. Then, I should verify the clinical context and symptoms. Next, I will consider the differential diagnosis for mild hyperamylasemia, including salivary sources, macroamylasemia, and benign pancreatic hyperenzymemia. After that, I should outline a practical, stepwise workup and when to image. Finally, I will synthesize a bottom-line recommendation and follow-up plan, making sure I double-check that each step aligns with current guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the magnitude of elevation and its diagnostic significance. An amylase of 129 U/L is only a mild elevation, typically less than 1.5 times the upper limit of normal, and it does not meet the ≥ 3× ULN threshold used to support a diagnosis of acute pancreatitis in the presence of compatible symptoms and/or imaging, so I should not jump to conclusions about pancreatitis based on this number alone [^111wfzKF] [^115ffP9f].

> Wait, let me verify the clinical context before labeling this as disease. I need to check for epigastric or left upper quadrant pain radiating to the back, nausea, vomiting, and peritoneal signs. If there are no symptoms, the likelihood of acute pancreatitis is low, and if symptoms are present, I should pair them with lipase and imaging to meet diagnostic criteria rather than relying on amylase alone [^111wfzKF] [^111nkKSU].

> Hold on, I should review the differential for mild hyperamylasemia. Salivary gland inflammation or injury, gastrointestinal conditions like gastroenteritis or peptic ulcer disease, gynecologic or ovarian pathology, and even ectopic amylase production can raise amylase modestly; importantly, macroamylasemia can cause persistent mild elevations without pancreatic disease, and benign pancreatic hyperenzymemia can present with fluctuating enzyme elevations in otherwise healthy individuals, so I need to ensure I do not anchor on pancreatitis prematurely [^114UnGxW] [^111mJEXT] [^117RZZYn].

> I will now examine the immediate next steps. I should confirm the result with a repeat amylase and obtain a serum lipase, because lipase is more specific and has a wider diagnostic window than amylase; if lipase is normal, that further lowers the probability of pancreatitis and shifts attention toward non-pancreatic sources or macroamylasemia, whereas a concordant mild elevation might still be non-pancreatic but warrants correlation with symptoms and imaging if indicated [^11694jax] [^1168pqk1].

> Let me consider when imaging is warranted. If the patient is asymptomatic, routine imaging is not indicated. If there are symptoms or persistent unexplained elevations, a right upper quadrant ultrasound is reasonable to assess for biliary disease, and contrast-enhanced CT or MRI should be reserved for diagnostic uncertainty or failure to improve clinically, rather than obtained routinely at presentation [^111nkKSU] [^11694jax].

> But wait, what if the elevation persists without symptoms? I should double-check for macroamylasemia using an amylase–creatinine clearance ratio. A value less than 1% in the setting of normal renal function supports macroamylasemia and avoids unnecessary invasive testing, and I should also consider whether celiac disease or other inflammatory conditions could be contributory, as macroamylasemia has been described in celiac disease and may persist despite a gluten-free diet in some cases [^111mJEXT] [^114N3oMW].

> Next, I should review medication and social history carefully. GLP-1 receptor agonists such as liraglutide and dulaglutide can cause small, often clinically insignificant increases in amylase and lipase; in the absence of symptoms, these findings are not diagnostic of pancreatitis, though I should remain vigilant if symptoms emerge and follow product labeling guidance [^1137b6of] [^115cpdCL] [^117XCG6m].

> Let me synthesize the bottom line. In a 26-year-old with an isolated amylase of 129 U/L, acute pancreatitis is unlikely unless there is characteristic pain and either lipase ≥ 3× ULN or imaging evidence; the most prudent course is to repeat amylase, obtain a lipase, assess symptoms, and avoid early imaging if the patient is well, while keeping macroamylasemia and benign pancreatic hyperenzymemia on the radar if the elevation persists without symptoms or other explanation [^111wfzKF] [^111nkKSU] [^117RZZYn].

> I should confirm the follow-up plan. If lipase is normal and the patient remains asymptomatic, no immediate further workup is needed. If lipase is mildly elevated or symptoms develop, I would proceed with targeted imaging and labs such as liver enzymes, calcium, and triglycerides to evaluate etiologies, and if unexplained hyperamylasemia persists beyond several months, I would reassess for macroamylasemia and benign hyperenzymemia to prevent unnecessary interventions [^11694jax] [^116VBxuw] [^111mJEXT].

An amylase of 129 U/L in a 26-year-old is a **mild, non-specific elevation** and not diagnostic of pancreatitis [^111wfzKF]. Confirm with **lipase** and assess for symptoms, medications, alcohol, and trauma [^1168pqk1]. If asymptomatic, observe and repeat; if symptomatic or persistent, obtain abdominal ultrasound [^116vydwn] and consider CT/MRI [^11694jax]. Evaluate for macroamylasemia [^111mJEXT] if unexplained. Most cases are benign or due to non-pancreatic causes; **pancreatitis is unlikely without lipase ≥ 3× ULN or imaging** [^115ffP9f].

---

## Normal reference ranges and clinical significance

Normal amylase typically ranges from 30–110 U/L; thus, 129 U/L is a **mild elevation** and not specific for pancreatitis [^111L2htC]. Mild hyperamylasemia is common and often reflects non-pancreatic sources or transient pancreatic irritation [^114UnGxW].

---

## Differential diagnosis of elevated amylase

Elevated amylase is **not specific to pancreatitis**; many pancreatic and non-pancreatic conditions can raise levels [^114UnGxW]:

| **Category** | **Conditions** |
|-|-|
| Pancreatic | - Acute pancreatitis [^111wfzKF] <br/> - Chronic pancreatitis [^111kbGuT] <br/> - Pancreatic trauma [^1155DCZd] <br/> - Pancreatic cancer [^notfound] |
| Non-pancreatic | - Salivary gland disorders (mumps, parotitis) [^1168XaEd] <br/> - Macroamylasemia [^111mJEXT] <br/> - Renal insufficiency [^notfound] <br/> - Gastrointestinal disorders (peptic ulcer, perforation, obstruction) [^111gXiHN] <br/> - Medications (e.g. GLP-1 agonists) [^1137b6of] <br/> - Alcohol use [^notfound] <br/> - Trauma [^114mGTbM] |

## Clinical approach to mild amylase elevation

### Initial evaluation

- **Confirm the result**: Repeat amylase to exclude lab error.
- **Clinical assessment**: Document abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, fever, alcohol/drug use, trauma, and medications [^111RYiBP].
- **Lipase testing**: Lipase is more specific than amylase for pancreatitis; levels > 3× ULN support the diagnosis when paired with symptoms/imaging [^111L2htC] [^111wfzKF].

---

### Further diagnostic evaluation

- **Imaging**: Abdominal ultrasound is first-line to assess biliary disease, pseudocysts, or ductal abnormalities; contrast-enhanced CT/MRI if symptoms persist or complications are suspected [^116vydwn] [^11694jax].
- **Macroamylasemia**: Consider if persistent unexplained elevation; check amylase-creatinine clearance ratio or polyethylene glycol precipitation [^111mJEXT].
- **Additional labs**: Liver enzymes, calcium, triglycerides, renal function, and inflammatory markers as indicated [^116VBxuw].

---

## Clinical implications and management

- **Benign course**: Most mild, isolated amylase elevations resolve spontaneously without intervention.
- **Observation**: Reassure and recheck if asymptomatic; investigate if symptomatic or persistent.
- **Treat underlying cause**: Address identified etiologies (e.g. biliary disease, medication, alcohol) [^113KdCdi].
- **Avoid unnecessary testing**: Do not over-image or over-test in stable, asymptomatic patients [^111nkKSU].

---

## When to be concerned

Be concerned if **lipase ≥ 3× ULN** with compatible symptoms or imaging [^111wfzKF], if there is persistent unexplained elevation, or if red flags such as severe pain, jaundice, weight loss, or systemic symptoms are present. These findings warrant further evaluation for pancreatitis or alternative pathology [^113hMxVS].

---

An amylase of 129 U/L in a 26-year-old is a **mild, non-specific finding**. Confirm with lipase, assess symptoms and context, and use imaging selectively. Most cases are benign or due to non-pancreatic causes; pancreatitis is unlikely without lipase ≥ 3× ULN or supportive imaging [^11694jax].

### Pancreatic safety of once-weekly dulaglutide in Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: subgroup analysis by potential influencing factors [^117XCG6m]. Diabetes Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In the randomized, open-label, parallel-arm, active-controlled phase III AWARD-CHN2 trial, once-weekly dulaglutide plus concomitant oral antihyperglycemic medications (OAMs) improved HbA1c over 26 weeks compared with once-daily insulin glargine in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). This post-hoc subgroup analysis of AWARD-CHN2 investigated the pancreatic safety of dulaglutide in Chinese patients with T2DM, stratified by potential influencing factors.

Methods

Changes in pancreatic enzyme (pancreatic amylase, total amylase, and lipase) levels over 26 weeks were assessed and stratified by patient age (< 60, ≥ 60 years), sex (female, male), duration of diabetes (< 10, ≥ 10 years), baseline weight (< 70, ≥ 70 kg), BMI (< 25, ≥ 25 kg/m²), HbA1c (< 8.5, ≥ 8.5%), triglycerides (< 2.3, ≥ 2.3 mmol/L), and concomitant OAMs (metformin, sulfonylurea, metformin plus sulfonylurea).

Results

A total of 203 Chinese patients with T2DM were included in this post-hoc analysis. Pancreatic enzyme levels increased within the normal range from baseline to Week 26, and no pancreatitis events were confirmed by independent adjudication. Least-squares mean increase in pancreatic amylase (U/L) from baseline to Week 26 was comparable across all subgroups with no statistically (all P-values > 0.05) or clinically significant between-group differences for age (< 60 years: 5.34; ≥ 60 years: 6.71), sex (female: 5.85; male: 5.66), duration of diabetes (< 10 years: 6.15; ≥ 10 years: 4.85), weight (< 70 kg: 6.19; ≥ 70 kg: 5.39), BMI (< 25 kg/m²: 5.92; ≥ 25 kg/m²: 5.61), HbA1c (< 8.5%: 6.82; ≥ 8.5%: 4.08), triglycerides (< 2.3 mmol/L: 4.94; ≥ 2.3 mmol/L: 8.04), and concomitant OAMs (metformin: 5.68; sulfonylurea: 5.44; metformin plus sulfonylurea: 5.87). Similar results were observed for total amylase and lipase.

Conclusion

In Chinese patients with T2DM receiving dulaglutide 1.5 mg in AWARD-CHN2, elevations of pancreatic enzymes over 26 weeks were within the normal range and were neither associated with pancreatitis nor baseline factors, which suggests the clinical use of dulaglutide in Chinese patients with T2DM is not associated with pancreatic safety issues.

### Definitions of pediatric pancreatitis and survey of present clinical practices [^114CFYBK]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2012). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "INSPPIRE diagnostic criteria for pediatric acute pancreatitis" for pediatric pancreatitis.

The INSPPIRE (International Study Group of Pediatric Pancreatitis: In Search for a Cure) diagnostic criteria is a clinical calculator specifically designed for the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis in pediatric patients. This scoring system is used to identify children who are likely to have acute pancreatitis based on a combination of symptoms, physical examination findings, and laboratory results. The INSPPIRE criteria include abdominal pain characteristic of pancreatitis, serum amylase and/or lipase levels greater than three times the upper limit of normal, and imaging findings consistent with acute pancreatitis. The clinical utility of this calculator is to provide a standardized method for diagnosing acute pancreatitis in children, which can help guide treatment decisions and predict prognosis. There are no specific exclusion criteria for its use, but it should be noted that it is not intended to replace clinical judgment or to be used in isolation. It should be used in conjunction with a comprehensive clinical assessment.

The INSPPIRE diagnostic criteria are used to evaluate the likelihood of pediatric acute pancreatitis by assessing three specific clinical factors. These factors are:

- Whether abdominal pain suggestive of or compatible with acute pancreatitis is present, characterized by acute onset especially in the epigastric region.
- Whether there is serum amylase and/or lipase activity at least more than three times the upper limit of normal.
- Whether imaging findings are characteristic of or compatible with acute pancreatitis.

For each factor, the response can be either "Yes" or "No". Each "Yes" response contributes 1 point to the total score, while each "No" response contributes 0 points. The points are tallied, resulting in a possible score range from 0 to 3. Here's how it works:

- **Abdominal pain**: "Yes" = 1 point, "No" = 0 points
- **Elevated enzyme levels**: "Yes" = 1 point, "No" = 0 points
- **Imaging findings**: "Yes" = 1 point, "No" = 0 points

The total score is the sum of the individual scores from these factors. Depending on the total score, the interpretation is as follows:

- A score of 2 or more suggests that the diagnostic criteria are met, indicating a high likelihood of acute pancreatitis.
- A score of 1 or less suggests that the diagnostic criteria are not met, indicating that acute pancreatitis is unlikely.

Through this simple yet effective scoring system, clinicians can systematically assess the presence of symptoms, biochemical markers, and imaging evidence to guide their diagnosis of pediatric acute pancreatitis.

### Abdominal pain in a 5-year-old boy [^117Y27Ar]. BMJ Case Reports (2011). Medium credibility.

A 5-year-old male presented with a 1-day history of vomiting, epigastric pain, loose stools and poor oral intake. The child had intermittent symptoms of abdominal pain and vomiting for the past 2 years and there was a strong family history of chronic hereditary pancreatitis. A random serum amylase was elevated at 2320 IU/l. Abdominal ultrasound scan revealed no abnormalities. On the basis of the family history, positive symptoms and elevated amylase, a diagnosis of hereditary pancreatitis was made. The child received symptomatic management and treatment for his acute illness. He is currently awaiting results from molecular testing.

### A multidisciplinary approach to an unusual cause of hyperamylasaemia [^114Npcca]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

Clinical features together with elevation of pancreatic enzymes are the key diagnostic indicators of acute pancreatitis. We report a case of a woman in her 50s who presented with abdominal distension and serum amylase raised to more than 30 times the upper limit of normal. She was initially treated for acute pancreatitis, however, she was not symptomatic of this and the pancreas appeared to be normal on CT scan. Further investigations revealed the patient had a high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma with nodal metastatic spread. An amylase-secreting ovarian tumour was suspected, which was supported by elevated salivary-amylase isoenzymes, consistent with previous reports in the literature. The patient was treated with chemotherapy and surgery, during which her serum amylase and CA-125 initially fell significantly, but eventually both increased, reflecting disease progression. This case serves as an important reminder to consider non-pancreatic causes of raised serum amylase, to avoid misdiagnosis.

### Abdominal pain and hyperamylasaemia – not always pancreatitis [^1168XaEd]. BMJ Case Reports (2010). Medium credibility.

A raised serum amylase concentration, at least four times the upper limit of normal (ULN), is used to support the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis in a patient presenting with abdominal pain. The authors report a case of toxic shock syndrome complicated by a raised serum amylase concentration that peaked at 50 times the ULN in a patient with recurrent abdominal pain. The commonest cause of hyperamylasaemia is pancreatic; however, further investigation of serum lipase and amylase isoenzyme studies found this to be of salivary origin and attributable to soft tissue inflammation of the salivary gland. This case highlights the need to consider non-pancreatic causes of hyperamylasaemia.

### Gastroenteritis-associated hyperamylasemia… [^113vR1E7]. JAMA Network (2002). Excellent credibility.

Results A total of 1041 patients with acute gastroenteritis were identified. Serum amylase levels were determined in 701 patients and were abnormally elevated in 66 of them. In 15 patients, other possible causes of hyperamylasemia were present, and these patients were excluded. The mean serum amylase level among the remaining 51 patients was 1. 32 of the upper normal level, with a range of up to
2. 2 times the upper normal range. The normal range of amylase levels in our laboratory is 30 to 300 IU/L, determined as the range of 2 SD of the mean, thereby allowing for 2. 5% of above-normal results in the reference population. 1 In our study, patients were considered to have hyperamylasemia only when their amylase values were higher than 318 IU/L, which is the value at 3 SD of the normal population.

A total of 1041 patients were seen in the emergency department with a diagnosis of acute gastroenteritis from April 1999 through November 1999. Amylase results were available for 701 of these patients. Sixty-six patients had elevated amylase values. Fifteen patients were excluded after the application of the exclusion criteria previously described, leaving 51 patients with gastroenteritis-related elevated amylase levels out of 686 patients with gastroenteritis and available amylase results. The average amylase level among the hyperamylasemic patients was 396 IU/L, with a range of 319 to 657 IU/L. In all 13 patients who were examined within a month after the gastroenteritis episode, amylase levels were found to be normal, showing the temporal association between gastroenteritis and hyperamylasemia. The fact that amylase values in our series did not exceed 2.

2 times the upper normal value should be interpreted cautiously, as inclusion of patients in this retrospective study was based on emergency department diagnosis of acute gastroenteritis. The course of gastroenteritis as manifested by duration of hospital stay, need for antibiotics, and clinical symptoms and laboratory results was similar in patients with elevated or normal amylase levels in our study.

### Don't test for amylase in cases of suspected acute pancreatitis… [^114uD1hq]. AAFP (2017). Low credibility.

Amylase and lipase are digestive enzymes normally released from the acinar cells of the exocrine pancreas into the duodenum. Following injury to the pancreas, these enzymes are released into the circulation. While amylase is cleared in the urine, lipase is reabsorbed back into the circulation. In cases of acute pancreatitis, serum activity for both enzymes is greatly increased. Serum lipase is now the preferred test due to its improved sensitivity, particularly in alcohol-induced pancreatitis. Its prolonged elevation creates a wider diagnostic window than amylase. In acute pancreatitis, amylase can rise rapidly within three to six hours of the onset of symptoms and may remain elevated for up to five days. Lipase, however, usually peaks at 24 hours with serum concentrations remaining elevated for eight to 14 days. This means it is far more useful than amylase when the clinical presentation or testing has been delayed for more than 24 hours.

Current guidelines and recommendations indicate that lipase should be preferred over total and pancreatic amylase for the initial diagnosis of acute pancreatitis and that the assessment should not be repeated over time to monitor disease prognosis. Repeat testing should be considered only when the patient has signs and symptoms of persisting pancreatic or peripancreatic inflammation, blockage of the pancreatic duct, or development of a pseudocyst. Testing both amylase and lipase is generally discouraged because it increases costs while only marginally improving diagnostic efficiency compared to either marker alone.

### 2019 WSES guidelines for the management of severe acute pancreatitis [^111L2htC]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Serum pancreatic enzyme measurement is the "gold standard" for the diagnosis of AP. In an episode of AP, amylase, lipase, elastase, and trypsin are released into the bloodstream at the same time but the clearance varies depending on the timing of blood sampling. Amylase is an enzyme secreted by the pancreas, and also salivary glands, small intestine, ovaries, adipose tissue, and skeletal muscles. There are two major isoforms of amylase: pancreatic and salivary, and the leading function is digestion of starch, glycogen, and related poly- and oligosaccharides, by hydrolysis. In AP, serum amylase levels usually rise within 6 to 24 h, peak at 48 h, and decrease to normal or near normal levels over the next 3 to 7 days.

Lipase is another enzyme secreted by the pancreas. AP is the main reason for an increase in lipase, and many investigators emphasize that lipase is more specific, but can be found elevated also in non-pancreatic diseases such as renal disease, appendicitis, acute cholecystitis, chronic pancreatitis, bowel obstruction, etc. In AP, serum lipase remains elevated for a longer period than serum amylase. It rises within 4 to 8 h, peaks at 24 h, and decreases to normal or near normal levels over the next 8 to 14 days.

Trypsinogen is the zymogen of the pancreatic enzyme trypsin. In AP, the serum and urinary concentrations of trypsinogen usually rise to high levels within a few hours and decrease in 3 days.

Collectively, serum lipase is considered a more reliable diagnostic marker of AP than serum amylase. No single test shows optimal diagnostic accuracy, but most current guidelines and recommendations indicate that lipase should be preferred over total and p-amylase. The main reasons supporting lipase over both types of amylase for the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis include higher sensitivity and larger diagnostic window. A Cochrane revision with the aim to compare the diagnostic accuracy of different pancreatic enzymes in the diagnosis of AP showed a sensitivity and specificity of 72% and 93% for serum amylase, and 79% and 89% for serum lipase, respectively.

Chang et al. found in a meta-analysis including 13 studies that trypsinogen-2 dipstick test is a rapid and non-invasive bedside test with sensitivity 82% and specificity 94% for AP.

### Acute abdominal pain in a 15-year-old male patient [^1166UKeZ]. Clinical Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

The mechanism for CIAP is not fully understood, but a landmark animal model study showed that following the intraperitoneal administration of a cannabinoid receptor agonist, AP severity was worsened in a dose-dependent fashion. Histology and laboratory testing have demonstrated evidence of pro-inflammatory effects on the pancreas, including pancreatic edema, inflammatory infiltrates, and serologic markers including lipase and amylase.

In 2004, a new possible cause of AP was identified in a 29-year-old man with a history of heavy cannabis use. To date, case reports of CIAP have mostly been documented in the adult population, ranging from 17 to 48 years old. Symptoms and laboratory values consistent with pancreatitis were seen across patient presentations, including acute epigastric pain, abdominal tenderness, nausea, and elevated amylase and lipase levels. Histories of heavy (up to 2–3 g per day), longtime, and sometimes daily cannabis use were reported. Of note, only one case report focused on a 17-year-old pediatric patient from France, who presented with epigastric pain, lipase of 1211 IU/L, status epilepticus, and a Glasgow Coma Scale of 15. His history was positive for a heavy daily cannabis use, primarily through a smoking device.

Cohort studies conducted on CIAP estimate that cannabis use was associated with approximately 9.3% to 10% of all AP cases and was the attributable cause in 2% to 2.9% of cases. Patients with CIAP were generally younger than 35 years of age, had daily and several-year histories of cannabis use, and consumption of more than 1 g per day. Interestingly, patients who reduced their consumption by at least 50% or who stopped altogether were found to have no recurring episodes of AP. Systematic reviews echo these findings, demonstrating a temporal effect between recurrent cases of AP and further cannabis use, and cannabis cessation resulting in no further episodes of recurrent AP.

### Amylase: a disease activity index in multiple myeloma? [^116yAM7R]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2006). Low credibility.

This study reports a case of a patient with lambda-light chain multiple myeloma who developed a high hyperamylasaemia of the salivary type during the disease and soon afterwards died. Ectopic production of amylase by myeloma cells has been described in a few cases and demonstrated by tissue culture and immunohistochemical techniques. The common characteristics of these cases were: salivary amylase isoenzyme increase, high tumor mass, extensive extra-medullary spread, extensive bone destruction and poor prognosis. In patients with amylase-producing multiple myeloma, the onset of hyperamylasaemia heralds a rapid disease progression; therefore, in these patients, a simple test such as serum amylase may represent a reliable disease activity index and provide an additional prognostic information.

### Classification of acute pancreatitis in the pediatric population: clinical report from the NASPGHAN pancreas committee [^1179Defv]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2017). Medium credibility.

Pediatric acute pancreatitis — local complications include peripancreatic and necrotic fluid collections, pancreatic and peripancreatic necrosis (sterile or infected), and development of pseudocysts and walled-off necrosis (sterile or infected); a pseudocyst is surrounded by a well-defined wall and usually does not form in < 4 weeks. Some complications may not develop within the first few days and may manifest later, with recurrence of abdominal pain, development of fever, and new or progressive increase in serum amylase levels suggesting their development.

### Recommendations for diagnosis and management of autoimmune pancreatitis in childhood: consensus from INSPPIRE [^116NgY19]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2018). Medium credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for pediatric pancreatitis, more specifically with respect to patients with autoimmune pancreatitis (laboratory tests), INSPPIRE 2018 guidelines recommend to recognize that pediatric autoimmune pancreatitis is associated with elevated amylase and lipase which due to a common subacute presentation may have already normalized at the time of diagnosis.

### Coeliac disease masquerading as macroamylasaemia [^114N3oMW]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Summary

Macroamylasaemia (MA) is a biochemical disorder characterised by elevated serum amylase activity, resulting from the circulation of a macromolecular complex of amylase bound to a serum component, often an immunoglobulin. The increased molecular weight of this complex prevents the normal renal excretion of the enzyme. A few cases of adult patients with coeliac disease (CD) and MA have been reported, in which the biochemical disorder resolved after treatment with a gluten-free diet. However, in other cases, this resolution did not occur. Here, we report a case of CD masquerading as recurrent pancreatitis due to the presence of MA.

### The clinical characteristics of focal acute pancreatitis based on imaging diagnosis: comparison with non-localized acute pancreatitis-a preliminary result [^114M7yuz]. BMC Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Compared with patients with non-localized AP, patients with focal AP have a smaller proportion of bloating and abdominal tenderness, and the levels of neutrophil ratio, D-dimer, GGT, amylase, and lipase are lower. However, there was no significant difference in the severity between two groups of patients. Therefore, although focal AP is a limited inflammatory change in imaging, it does not show a milder disease than non-localized AP, on the contrary, focal AP is clinically more difficult to diagnose in a timely and accurate manner due to the insignificance of symptoms and changes in certain laboratory indicators, which requires the attention of clinicians.

### Acute abdominal pain in a 15-year-old male patient [^116vAux3]. Clinical Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Acute pancreatitis describes the process of reversible inflammation of the pancreas following injury and inflammatory response. Over the last 2 decades, studies have shown increasing incidence in pediatric cases which are estimated at 3.6 to 13.2 per 100 000 individuals. While infection is a leading cause of pancreatitis in children, a variety of causes of AP are known, including structural/anatomic, obstructive/biliary, medications, trauma, metabolic, and genetic causes. Acute pancreatitis is one of the most common causes of gastroenterology-related hospitalization and accounts for more than 2 billion in hospital costs annually in the United States.

Diagnostic criteria for AP include evidence of 2 of the following: (1) lipase and/or amylase greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal, (2) acute onset of epigastric abdominal pain, and (3) evidence of pancreatitis on imaging.

When examining the differential diagnosis for symptoms of epigastric pain and emesis with a known history of cannabis use, cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome is an important diagnosis to consider. Cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome is characterized by cyclical hyperemesis and abdominal pain after consuming cannabis, which may be relieved by baths or hot showers. In our patient, his emesis and abdominal pain were not cyclical in nature and did not recur following his admission.

Cannabis is the most frequently consumed recreational drug in the world. Cannabis use is highly prevalent among adolescents, with a recent Canadian survey reporting the average age of initiation to be 14.3 years, with up to 44% of youth aged 16 to 19 using cannabis within the last year, and 31% increasing their use during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data from the United States show that up to 25% of high school students reported cannabis use in the last month.

### The spectrum of valproic acid-associated pancreatitis [^114ttqWY]. Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

Our goal was to characterize valproic acid-associated pancreatitis in children.

Patients and Methods

The charts of all patients with pancreatitis (diagnosed by using strict criteria) associated with valproic acid during a 10-year period were reviewed. Clinical and laboratory results were abstracted.

Results

Twenty-two patients with valproic acid-associated pancreatitis were seen during the study period. Symptoms were similar to those of patients with pancreatitis from other etiologies and included abdominal pain/tenderness (83%), vomiting/retching (74%), abdominal distention (30%), and fever/chills (26%). Valproic acid levels were in the therapeutic range in all but 1 patient. The mean duration of therapy before the onset of pancreatitis was 32 months. The serum lipase level was > 3 times the reference value in all patients, but the serum amylase level was not significantly elevated in 31% of the patients tested. Imaging studies altered clinical management in only 1 patient. The length of stay was generally brief (mean: 8 days). Two patients died. Of the 5 patients who were rechallenged, 4 had relapses.

Conclusions

Valproic acid-associated pancreatitis does not depend on valproic acid serum level and may occur any time after the onset of therapy. The serum lipase level is more sensitive than the serum amylase level and should be obtained when pancreatitis is suspected. Early imaging studies did not change clinical management.

Initial evaluation and diagnosis of pediatric acute pancreatitis — diagnosis relies on clinical criteria and requires at least 2 of 3 elements: abdominal pain compatible with acute pancreatitis, serum lipase or serum amylase at least 3 times the upper limit of normal, and imaging findings consistent with acute pancreatitis; abdominal pain and/or irritability are common, and in infants and toddlers symptoms may be subtle necessitating a high index of suspicion.

### American College of Gastroenterology guidelines: management of acute pancreatitis [^111nkKSU]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Acute pancreatitis (AP) — diagnostic criteria and early CT use: Diagnosis is most often established by identification of 2 of the 3 criteria — abdominal pain consistent with the disease, serum amylase and/or lipase greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal, and/or characteristic findings from abdominal imaging. Patients with AP typically present with epigastric or left upper quadrant pain that is usually constant with radiation to the back, chest, or flanks, whereas pain described as dull, colicky, or located in the lower abdominal region is not consistent with AP and suggests an alternative etiology. Abdominal imaging is often helpful to determine the diagnosis of AP in patients with atypical presentations. Due to limitations on sensitivity and negative predictive value, serum amylase alone cannot be used reliably for the diagnosis of AP, and serum lipase is preferred. Regarding early imaging, "We suggest that early at/admission routine computed tomography (CT) not be performed for the purpose of determining severity in AP and should be reserved for patients in whom the diagnosis is unclear or who fail to improve clinically within the first 48–72 hours after hospital admission and intravenous hydration".

### Eosinophilic duodenitis misdiagnosed as acute pancreatitis in a child: a case report [^113JP6dU]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusions

Non-EoE EGIDs are rare immune-mediated disorders of the GI tract observed in children. Patients present with various upper and lower GI symptoms, and these disorders are diagnosed based on clinical manifestations and histologic evidence of eosinophilic inflammation after ruling out a secondary cause or systemic illnesses. It is believed that GI segment-specific threshold eosinophil values are considered prior to making a non-EoE EGIDs diagnosis.

Our patient presented with abdominal distension, vomiting, epigastric pain, and slightly increased amylase and lipase values. Imaging findings revealed mild common bile duct and pancreatic duct dilatation without relevant changes in the pancreas (pancreatic swelling, peripancreatic fluid). Considering that she presented with abdominal discomfort for 7 days and mild elevation of lipase and amylase at that time and that her serum amylase and lipase values were less than the discriminatory level (≥ 3 times greater than the upper limit of normal), we could not exclude the possibility of a resolving pancreatic inflammation despite the imaging findings not compatible with AP.

### Once-weekly glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist dulaglutide is non-inferior to once-daily liraglutide and superior to placebo in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes: a 26-week randomized phase III study [^117Cem38]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

Up to 26 weeks, 9 patients (1.8%) experienced any hypoglycaemia [dulaglutide, n = 6 (2.1%); liraglutide, n = 2 (1.5%); placebo, n = 1 (1.4%)]; no episodes of severe hypoglycaemia were reported. Two patients (0.7%; both dulaglutide) experienced nocturnal hypoglycaemia up to 26 weeks.

In a pairwise comparison at 26 weeks, dulaglutide significantly increased total amylase and lipase levels compared with placebo (p < 0.001; Table 2). No difference was observed between dulaglutide and liraglutide in changes in total amylase level. Liraglutide significantly increased lipase levels compared with dulaglutide (median increases were 11.0 and 7.0 U/l, respectively; p < 0.001; Table 2). No patients in the dulaglutide or liraglutide groups had amylase levels > 3 × upper limit of normal (ULN; Table 2). Four (1.5%) patients in the dulaglutide group and 2 (1.5%) in the liraglutide group had lipase levels > 3 × ULN; the elevated values decreased below 3 × ULN while the patients continued on study medication. None of these patients discontinued study treatment because of pancreatic adverse events. There were no adjudicated events of confirmed pancreatitis.

One patient, a 67‐year‐old female who was treated with liraglutide for approximately 15 weeks, was diagnosed with pancreatic carcinoma.

Seated vital signs and ECG PR interval are summarized in Table 2. There were no differences in systolic or diastolic blood pressure change from baseline between dulaglutide and placebo; liraglutide resulted in a significantly greater decrease from baseline in seated systolic blood pressure compared with dulaglutide (p = 0.013). Seated pulse rates were increased in all groups, with no significant differences between the groups. ECG PR interval was prolonged from baseline in dulaglutide compared with placebo (p = 0.052); the ECG PR interval increase with liraglutide was similar to dulaglutide. No confirmed adjudicated cardiovascular events were observed.

From baseline up to 26 weeks, all patients had serum calcitonin values within normal limits. The patient with pancreatic carcinoma described previously also had a thyroid neoplasm treatment‐emergent adverse event, which was considered to be of mild severity and not related to study drug by the investigator.

### An 18-year-old with acute-on-chronic abdominal pain [^112rYNYr]. Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

An 18-year-old woman with a complex past medical history presented with 2 days of vomiting and lower abdominal pain. She had been admitted for the majority of the previous 5 months for recurrent pancreatitis and had undergone a cholecystectomy. Additional symptoms included nausea, anorexia, constipation, and a 40-lb weight loss over 4 months. She appeared uncomfortable, and an examination was remarkable for tachycardia, hypertension, and diffuse abdominal tenderness to light palpation. Her initial laboratory test results revealed mildly elevated liver enzymes (aspartate aminotransferase 68 U/L, alanine aminotransferase 80 U/L) and a normal lipase. She was admitted for pain control and nutritional support. Over the next few days, the lipase increased to 1707 U/L. Despite optimizing her management for acute pancreatitis, the patient's symptoms persisted. Further history gathering and laboratory testing ultimately revealed her diagnosis. Our expert panel reviews her hospital course and elucidates the management of our eventual diagnosis.

### A 21-year-old man with chronic pancreatitis [^111BSaZo]. JAMA (2008). Excellent credibility.

Chronic pancreatitis is a disease for which the diagnosis may be difficult to ascertain and the treatments are limited. Using the case of a 21-year-old man who has had recurrent episodes of epigastric pain since age 10 years and was ultimately diagnosed as having idiopathic pancreatitis complicated by pancreatic duct stones, we discuss the evaluation and treatment of chronic pancreatitis. Diagnosis is based on thorough history taking, physical examination, and carefully selected imaging studies. Etiologies may be structural or nonstructural; genes predisposing to chronic pancreatitis have been identified. An evidence-based approach to treatment is limited by a paucity of randomized controlled trials. We address the patient's concerns regarding chronic pancreatitis, including what he should expect over the next several years, whether endoscopic or surgical therapies should be considered, and whether there are any cures.

### Once-weekly glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist dulaglutide significantly decreases glycated haemoglobin compared with once-daily liraglutide in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes: 52 weeks of treatment in a randomized phase III study [^115tsdo9]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

Table 2
Safety assessments up to week 52.

Eight dulaglutide‐treated (2.9%) and four liraglutide‐treated (2.9%) patients experienced at least one episode of hypoglycaemia; no cases of severe hypoglycaemia were reported. A total of three patients [dulaglutide, two patients (0.7%); liraglutide, one patient (0.7%)] experienced nocturnal hypoglycaemia.

Pancreatic enzymes (amylase and lipase) at week 52 are summarized in Table 2. Treatment with liraglutide significantly increased lipase compared with dulaglutide (median increases 9.0 U/l vs 6.0 U/l, respectively; p < 0.001). Changes from baseline in amylase were not significantly different between the treatments. In both treatment groups, 7.3% of patients had treatment‐emergent postbaseline amylase values above the upper limit of normal (ULN). The percentages of patients with treatment‐emergent postbaseline lipase values above the ULN were dulaglutide, 26.4% and liraglutide, 36.4%. One dulaglutide‐treated patient and no liraglutide‐treated patients experienced amylase values > 3 × ULN. Five dulaglutide‐treated patients and two liraglutide‐treated patients, as well as one patient who received placebo for 26 weeks and dulaglutide for 26 weeks, experienced a lipase value > 3 × ULN. No cases of pancreatitis were confirmed by adjudication. Two patients were diagnosed with pancreatic carcinoma: a 65‐year‐old man who was treated with placebo and dulaglutide for a total of 52 weeks (diagnosis occurred during the follow‐up period after completion of the treatment period) and a 67‐year‐old woman who was treated with liraglutide for approximately 15 weeks.

Laboratory Tests

Bilirubin

In the five adult glycemic control trials of at least 26 weeks duration, mildly elevated serum bilirubin concentrations (elevations to no more than twice the upper limit of the reference range) occurred in 4.0% of VICTOZA-treated patients, 2.1% of placebo-treated patients and 3.5% of active-comparator-treated patients. This finding was not accompanied by abnormalities in other liver tests. The significance of this isolated finding is unknown.

Calcitonin

Calcitonin, a biological marker of MTC, was measured throughout the clinical development program. At the end of the adult glycemic control trials, adjusted mean serum calcitonin concentrations were higher in VICTOZA-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients but not compared to patients receiving active comparator. Between group differences in adjusted mean serum calcitonin values were approximately 0.1 ng/L or less. Among adult patients with pretreatment calcitonin < 20 ng/L, calcitonin elevations to > 20 ng/L occurred in 0.7% of VICTOZA-treated patients, 0.3% of placebo-treated patients, and 0.5% of active-comparator-treated patients. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown.

Lipase and Amylase

In one adult glycemic control trial in renal impairment patients, a mean increase of 33% for lipase and 15% for amylase from baseline was observed for VICTOZA-treated patients while placebo-treated patients had a mean decrease in lipase of 3% and a mean increase in amylase of 1%.

In the LEADER trial, serum lipase and amylase were routinely measured. Among adult VICTOZA-treated patients, 7.9% had a lipase value at any time during treatment of greater than or equal to 3 times the upper limit of normal compared with 4.5% of placebo-treated patients, and 1% of VICTOZA-treated patients had an amylase value at any time during treatment of greater than or equal to 3 times the upper limit of normal versus 0.7% of placebo-treated patients.

The clinical significance of elevations in lipase or amylase with VICTOZA is unknown in the absence of other signs and symptoms of pancreatitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Vital signs

VICTOZA did not have adverse effects on blood pressure. Mean increases from baseline in heart rate of 2 to 3 beats per minute have been observed in adult patients treated with VICTOZA compared to placebo.

### Rare cause of recurrent acute pancreatitis in teenage man [^112bJduj]. Egastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Establishing the diagnosis of recurrent acute pancreatitis

Laboratory tests revealed elevated serum amylase (AMY ranged from 239 to 996 U/L; normal range, 36–143 U/L), alkaline phosphatase (ranged from 134 to 161 U/L; normal range, 35–100 U/L), gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT ranged from 42.5 to 256 U/L; normal range, 7–45 U/L) and total bilirubin (Tbil ranged from 21.4 to 76.1 µmol/L; normal range, 5.1–22.2 µmol/L) levels. The abdominal CT scan revealed peripancreatic inflammation and effusion, hepatomegaly and decreased liver parenchymal density (figure 1). MRCP findings were consistent with acute pancreatitis. According to the Revised Atlanta Classification, the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis was confirmed for each episode based on the patient (1) experiencing abdominal pain indicative of pancreatitis, (2) having serum AMY or lipase levels exceeding three times the upper normal limit and (3) exhibiting characteristic imaging findings, meeting all three diagnostic criteria. Recurrent acute pancreatitis (RAP) refers to repeated episodes of acute inflammation of the pancreas. Unlike chronic pancreatitis, where there is ongoing, irreversible damage and inflammation, RAP involves discrete episodes of inflammation separated by periods during which the pancreas returns to normal or near-normal function, which is seen in this patient. Based on meeting the criteria of experiencing two or more well-documented separate attacks of acute pancreatitis with complete resolution for more than 3 months between attacks, the diagnosis of recurrent acute pancreatitis is established.

### Primary Sjögren's syndrome presenting as hypokalaemic periodic paralysis and acute pancreatitis [^114Ywu4k]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

Renal tubular acidosis is a well-known consequence of primary Sjogren's syndrome (pSS), but a rare manifestation similar to acute pancreatitis in pSS. Here, we discuss the case of a woman in her 50s, who presented to a tertiary care hospital with recurrent episodes of sudden-onset weakness in all four limbs, recurrent vomiting and epigastric pain. She had non-anion gap metabolic acidosis with hypokalaemia and was diagnosed with pSS with hypokalaemic periodic paralysis. She was also diagnosed with acute pancreatitis based on elevated amylase and lipase levels and CT findings. The article highlights the diverse spectrum of clinical manifestations of pSS, including renal and pancreatic involvements, which can be rare consequences of the disease.

### Acute abdominal pain in a 15-year-old male patient [^114zD5wA]. Clinical Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Acute pancreatitis describes the process of reversible inflammation of the pancreas following injury and inflammatory response. While a variety of causative mechanisms are known, an emerging possible etiology is cannabis consumption. A variety of cases have been published on CIAP in the adult population since 2004; however, there has been limited documentation of pediatric presentations and management. This case describes the presentation of CIAP in a 15-year-old male patient in the context of a 1.5-year history of cannabis use, with progressive use in the days and month before. This is the second-ever documented case of pediatric CIAP, the youngest patient with documented CIAP known to date, and the first documented pediatric perspective in North America. Given the rising use of cannabis in the pediatric population, it is important to consider AP on the differential diagnosis and assess a lipase level in the emergency department. Timely analysis and documentation of this risk factor is pertinent to understanding future cases.

Acute pancreatitis — diagnostic criteria and etiologies specify that diagnosis of AP requires at least 2 features, including characteristic abdominal pain; biochemical evidence with amylase or lipase elevated > 3 times the upper limit of normal; and/or radiographic evidence on cross-sectional imaging. The most common causes remain gallstones and alcohol, which together comprise 80% of cases, and most cases of AP (around 80%) are mild with only interstitial changes without local or systemic complications. Necrotizing pancreatitis is characterized by pancreatic and/or peripancreatic necrosis and is typically seen in patients with moderately severe or severe AP.

### A very high amylase can be benign in paediatric Crohn's disease [^1144Q74L]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Medium credibility.

A 12.5-year-old boy with Crohn's disease with abdominal pain had a raised amylase of 1835 IU/l with normal lipase levels. Ultrasound showed no evidence of inflammation of pancreas. The amylase to creatinine clearance ratio, was 0.8% (reference interval 2%-5%; > 6% consistent with acute pancreatitis; < 1.6% with macroamylasemia), suggesting he had raised serum amylase with a corresponding reduced clearance of amylase in his urine, positively supporting the diagnosis of macroamylasemia. Macroamylasemia has no clinical significance other than misdiagnosis as acute pancreatitis. Awareness of this condition is important and a positive diagnosis should always be made to avoid unnecessary changes in treatments.

### The evaluation of serum amylase levels in nonpancreatic disease… [^111gXiHN]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Introduction It is accepted that serum amylase estimation is "one of the pillars upon which rests the modern concrete diagnosis of acute pancreatitis, "1 and the normally accepted value is from 80–150 Somogyi units, 1 200 units being considered as pathological and 1, 000 units being found in acute pancreatitis, the highest level being attained in less than one hour from the onset of symptoms. Expressed in milligrams of reducing substance per 100 ml. of serum it would appear that the normal level of serum amylase is 30–125 mg. 2 or from 50–200 mg. ,3 or 40–175 mg. 4Serum amylase may be moderately raised in certain conditions in which a normal pancreas is present, but these are exceptional.

### Prospective validation of a prediction model for the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis [^111cmZpL]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

In this multicenter study, we prospectively validated a prediction model for the diagnosis of AP among patients presenting to the ED with elevated serum lipase levels. Using nonimaging parameters readily ascertainable at presentation, the model demonstrated excellent discriminatory accuracy (AUROC, 0.91). At a cutoff of at least 6 points, which optimized diagnostic accuracy and performance, the yield of early abdominal CT or MRI was low. This novel model has important implications in the diagnosis of AP.

Acute pancreatitis ranks among the leading contributors to hospitalizations, readmissions, and health care costs among all gastrointestinal tract disorders in the US. Despite improvements in mortality and length of hospital stay, the cost of hospitalization continues to increase, partly due to increasing reliance on imaging studies, particularly at presentation.

The current AP diagnostic criteria, which were first proposed in 2006and agreed on by international consensus in 2012, require 2 of the following 3 features: (1) characteristic abdominal pain, (2) serum lipase (or amylase) level of at least 3 times the ULN, and (3) characteristic findings of AP on contrast-enhanced CT or MRI. While multiple AP clinical guidelines, explicitly state that routine early imaging is not necessary because it rarely reveals alternative diagnoses, changes clinical management, or improves outcomes, we found in this study that early imaging was used in 65.0% of participants.

### Coeliac disease masquerading as macroamylasaemia [^112jSZM4]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

The case described here demonstrates the association between CD and MA.

Several studies have described the link between MA and CD, showing differences in amylase levels in several patients. Studies have reported improvements in amylase levels in patients after switching to a GFD. Bonetti et al described a case of resolved MA. Liu et al also explored cases of patients with CD, MA and combinations of other conditions such as hyperamylasaemia and immune abnormalities. Similar patient outcomes were reported by Depsames et al. The study described a patient with CD and elevated serum amylase activity, but no classical gastrointestinal signs. MA eventually resolved after adopting a GFD, similar to observations in previous studies. A case report by La Villa et al of a woman with unrecognised CD who exhibited various immune system abnormalities also revealed extraintestinal manifestations that improved or resolved entirely after transitioning to a GFD. The case report by Viswanath and Wynnedescribed that a woman with chronic malabsorption showed symptom improvement and disappearance of the macroamylase complex after switching to a GFD.

Notably, the population-based work by Rabsztyn et al on MA reported rare cases of persistent MA in patients on a GFD. However, this study did not specify whether the patients strictly adhered to the GFD, which could be linked to the prevalence of MA in some patients on the GFD.

Contrary to most published findings, our current study on a patient in her late 20s with MA, who had clinical, serological and intestinal histopathological features of CD, showed transient improvement in amylase levels but never returned to normal levels after switching to a strict GFD, as demonstrated by the normalisation of serum TTG level.

Learning points

Coeliac disease may be a cause of hyperamylasaemia.
Consider macroamylasaemia as a cause of persistent hyperamylasaemia, particularly when serum lipase levels remain consistently normal, and the patient's clinical presentation is not typical of acute pancreatitis.

Results

Diagnosis

Questions:
Which are the criteria to establish the diagnosis of severe acute pancreatitis?
What is the appropriate imaging work-up in case of suspected severe acute pancreatitis? What is the role of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT) scan, ultrasound (US), endoscopic ultrasound (EUS), and other ancillary tests?
Which laboratory parameters should be considered in the diagnostic process?
How do different etiologies affect the diagnostic workup?
Which scores are indicated for risk assessment?
What is the timing and the suitable test for early follow-up imaging?

Statements (severity grading)

Severe acute pancreatitis is associated with persistent organ failure (cardiovascular, respiratory, and/or renal), and high mortality. Both new classification systems, Revised Atlanta Classification and Determinant-based Classification of Acute Pancreatitis Severity, are similar in establishing the diagnosis and severity of acute pancreatitis (1C).
Patients who have persistent organ failure with infected necrosis have the highest risk of death (1C).
Patients with organ failures should be admitted to an intensive care unit whenever possible (1C).

Discussion

Acute pancreatitis (AP) represents a disease characterized by acute inflammation of the pancreas and histologically acinar cell destruction. The diagnosis of AP requires at least the presence of two of the three following criteria: (i) abdominal pain consistent with the disease, (ii) biochemical evidence of pancreatitis (serum amylase and/or lipase greater than three times the upper limit of normal), and (iii) characteristic findings from abdominal imaging.

Most patients (80–85%) will develop a mild disease course (self-limited, mortality < 1–3%), but around 20% will have a moderate or severe episode of AP, with a mortality rate from 13 to 35%. Thus, it is important to diagnose (or better predict) an episode of severe acute pancreatitis (SAP), and to identify the patients with high risk of developing complications.

### Coeliac disease masquerading as macroamylasaemia [^115rigqt]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Macroamylasaemia (MA) is a biochemical disorder characterised by elevated serum amylase activity, resulting from the circulation of a macromolecular complex of amylase bound to a serum component, often an immunoglobulin. The increased molecular weight of this complex prevents the normal renal excretion of the enzyme. A few cases of adult patients with coeliac disease (CD) and MA have been reported, in which the biochemical disorder resolved after treatment with a gluten-free diet. However, in other cases, this resolution did not occur. Here, we report a case of CD masquerading as recurrent pancreatitis due to the presence of MA.

### Urinary amylase / urinary creatinine ratio (uAm / uCr) – a less-invasive parameter for management of hyperamylasemia [^116a8H5q]. BMC Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusions

uAm/uCr was found to significantly correlate with sAm, and therefore may be of use as an alternative to sAm during management of patients with hyperamylasemia. Use of urine samples results in a decreased number of blood samples, which is especially important in pediatric patients. This retrospective preliminary report will need to be supported by further studies in order to elucidate the practical usefulness of uAm/uCr in management of hyperamylasemia.

### American College of Gastroenterology guidelines: management of acute pancreatitis [^11694jax]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Diagnostic enzymes and imaging — Serum amylase concentrations may be normal in alcohol-induced AP and hypertriglyceridemia, and serum lipase seems to be more specific and remains elevated longer than amylase following disease presentation. For example, an upper limit of normal greater than 3–5 times may be needed in some patients, and while elevations of amylase and lipase greater than 3× normal help establish AP, some patients without AP will have such elevations; once the diagnosis of AP is established, there is no reason to follow the serum amylase or lipase. Abdominal imaging may confirm AP: contrast-enhanced CT provides more than 90% sensitivity and specificity; routine abdominal CT is unwarranted, but in a patient failing to improve after 48–72 hours CT or MRI is recommended to assess local complications, and CT and MRI are comparable in the early assessment of AP.

In this case report, we describe a paediatric case of hyperamylasemia following parotid trauma. A 12-year-old boy was hit by a motorcycle, sustaining only superficial lacerations to the face overlying the parotid. A hyperamylasemia was noted, and further characterised by a fractionated isoamylase test, as being predominantly of the salivary type. Serum lipase levels were low. Based on these investigations, pancreatic injury was judged unlikely with the minor parotid trauma being the probable source of the hyperamylasemia. The patient was spared further unnecessary investigations and managed conservatively.

Pediatric acute pancreatitis — diagnosis and initial evaluation — requires meeting INSPPIRE-based criteria with at least two features, including abdominal pain, enzyme elevation, or imaging findings, and initial imaging should be transabdominal ultrasonography with additional imaging reserved for complicated cases; first-attack testing should include liver enzymes, triglyceride, and calcium levels. Specifically, diagnosis "requires at least 2 of the following: (1) abdominal pain compatible with AP, (2) serum amylase and/or lipase values ≥ 3 times upper limits of normal, (3) imaging findings consistent with AP", and "Initial imaging may be accomplished via transabdominal ultrasonography, with other imaging (CT, MRI) reserved for more complicated cases ± tailored to suspected etiology", while "first attack of AP testing should include liver enzymes (ALT, AST, GGT, ALP, bilirubin), triglyceride level, and calcium level".

### Persistent elevation of aspartate aminotransferase in a child after incomplete Kawasaki disease: a case report and literature review [^113W8XAm]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Interpretation of liver function abnormalities is a common problem faced by clinicians. Abnormal liver function tests in asymptomatic children, not only pose a challenge to physicians, but may also be worrisome for the child's family. Elevated liver enzymes may be benign, but physicians often perform extensive investigations which include workup for liver, hematologic and bone diseases.

Macro-aspartate aminotransferase (macro-AST) is a condition where AST binds to macromolecules such as immunoglobulins or other plasma components. Due to their large size and mass, macro-AST complexes are not easily cleared by the renal glomeruli, resulting in elevated serum levels. The described macromolecules comprise of macro-amylase, macro-prolactin, macro-LDH and macro-alkaline phosphatase. This condition is observed in hepatitis C virus, monoclonal gammopathy and malignancy patients and normal children. We reviewed the literature and reported a child with Kawasaki disease (KD) and macro-AST.

### Splenic injury complicating ERCP [^114K9HKs]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Case report

We report a case of a 64-year-old man who sustained a splenic injury following ERCP. He was admitted to hospital with obstructive jaundice, and he reported a past medical history of coronary heart disease, right lower pulmonary lobectomy due to lung cancer 5 years previously and nephrotic syndrome. The basic laboratory tests were normal except for liver function tests, which showed a bilirubin level of 12.6 mg/dL (reference level, 0.3–1.2 mg/L), an alkaline phosphatase level of 419 U/L (reference level, 40–129 U/L), and an amylase level of 708 U/L (reference level, 28–128 U/L). His clotting profile was normal.

The abdominal computed tomography (CT) showed a mass at the head of the pancreas with dilated pancreatic and common bile duct and additionally some paraortic and mesenteric lymph nodes. The CT was performed without intravenous contrast medium due to renal insufficiency. An upper GI endoscopy revealed duodenal stenosis (treated with balloon dilatation) and a deformed ampulla of Vater secondary to the tumor. An ERCP followed which confirmed the above findings and a plastic stent was placed in the common bile duct and draining was achieved.

Six hours after the procedure the patient complained of epigastric pain. He was afebrile with a pulse rate of 85 beats/ min and a systolic and diastolic blood pressure of 100 and 70 mm Hg respectively. The physical examination revealed a soft abdomen with mild tenderness over the epigastrium and left upper quadrant without peritoneal signs. The next day (18 h after the procedure) a second CT was performed which showed a homogeneous mass lesion of the left subdiaphragmatic region in keeping with a splenic hematoma (Fig. 1). A hemoperitneum and a plastic biliary stent were also present. Laboratory blood tests including complete blood count showed a decrease of the hemoglobin (from 14.1 to 8.0 g/dL) and mild leukocytosis: 11.3 k/mL. Subsequently, an emergency surgical solution was offered to the patient. After entering the peritoneal cavity the following findings were observed: a) rupture at the hilum of the spleen; and b) a solid mass in the head of the pancreas obstructing the duodenum. Splenectomy was performed (Fig. 2) with meticulous hemostasis and enterogastrostomy (stomach - jejunum) in order to bypass the obstructed duodenum.

Serum pancreatic enzymes — immunoreactive trypsinogen (IRT), lipase, and amylase — reflect disease activity but have limited diagnostic value for exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI). The text states "abnormally low serum levels of a pancreatic enzyme may indicate EPI", and "There are 3 commonly measured serum enzymes: immunoreactive trypsinogen (IRT), lipase, and amylase". Levels rise with inflammation: "During pancreatic inflammation, their levels are elevated", including that "Serum lipase and amylase are elevated during acute pancreatitis", and "the IRT is high in patients with CF, which is the basis for newborn screening". Conversely, "The serum IRT, lipase, and amylase, however, are low in older patients with CF who have EPI", and "The IRT and amylase are reduced in patients with SD". Overall, "These markers have low sensitivity and specificity for EPI, and for this reason, their role is, at best, to support a diagnosis".

### Man with epigastric pain and persistently elevated serum lipase [^113hMxVS]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Serum lipase and amylase are commonly requested in individuals presenting with abdominal pain for investigation of acute pancreatitis. Pancreatic hyperenzymaemia is not specific for acute pancreatitis, occurring in many other pancreatic and non-pancreatic conditions. Where persistent elevation of serum lipase and amylase occurs in the absence of a diagnosed cause or evidence of laboratory assay interference, ongoing radiological assessment for pancreatic disease is required for 24 months before a diagnosis of benign pancreatic hyperenzymaemia can be made. We report a case of a 71-year-old man with epigastric pain and elevated serum lipase levels. He was extensively investigated, but no pancreatic disease was detected. He is asymptomatic, but serum lipase levels remain elevated 18 months after his initial presentation.

### Hypertriglyceridaemia-induced pancreatitis [^114bB8XB]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Hypertriglyceridaemia is the third most common cause of acute pancreatitis but is relatively rare and therefore requires a high level of clinical suspicion to be diagnosed. We discuss the case of a 46-year-old man who initially presented to the accident and emergency department with suspected first presentation of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and a normal amylase but who did not respond to DKA treatment. Further history revealed significant cardiovascular risk factors, examination showed an evidence of hyperlipidaemia and investigations revealed acute pancreatitis secondary to hypertriglyceridaemia. We discuss the causes of hypertriglyceridaemia, the difficulty in differentiating primary versus secondary hypertriglyceridaemia, possible pathogenesis and current evidence-based treatments.

Serum biomarkers in pediatric acute pancreatitis — serum lipase or serum amylase at least 3 times the upper limit of normal is consistent with pancreatitis; lipase typically rises within 6 hours, peaks at 24 to 30 hours, and can remain elevated for more than 1 week, whereas amylase may rise within 3 to 6 hours and normalize within 24 hours; some advocate lipase alone is sufficient as it is more sensitive and specific for acute pancreatitis (87%–100% and 95%–100%, respectively).

### Liraglutide [^115cpdCL]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Cholelithiasis and cholecystitis:

In adult glycemic control trials of liraglutide injection, the incidence of cholelithiasis was 0.3% in both liraglutide injection- treated and placebo-treated patients. The incidence of cholecystitis was 0.2% in both liraglutide injection-treated and placebo-treated patients.

Laboratory Tests

Bilirubin:

In the five adult glycemic control trials of at least 26 weeks duration, mildly elevated serum bilirubin concentrations (elevations to no more than twice the upper limit of the reference range) occurred in 4.0% of liraglutide injection-treated patients, 2.1% of placebo-treated patients and 3.5% of active-comparator-treated patients. This finding was not accompanied by abnormalities in other liver tests. The significance of this isolated finding is unknown.

Calcitonin:

Calcitonin, a biological marker of MTC, was measured throughout the clinical development program. At the end of the adult glycemic control trials, adjusted mean serum calcitonin concentrations were higher in liraglutide injection-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients but not compared to patients receiving active comparator. Between group differences in adjusted mean serum calcitonin values were approximately 0.1 ng/L or less.

Among adult patients with pretreatment calcitonin < 20 ng/L, calcitonin elevations to > 20 ng/L occurred in 0.7% of liraglutide injection-treated patients, 0.3% of placebo-treated patients, and 0.5% of active-comparator-treated patients. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown.

Lipase and Amylase:

In one adult glycemic control trial in renal impairment patients, a mean increase of 33% for lipase and 15% for amylase from baseline was observed for liraglutide injection-treated patients while placebo-treated patients had a mean decrease in lipase of 3% and a mean increase in amylase of 1%.

The clinical significance of elevations in lipase or amylase with liraglutide injection is unknown in the absence of other signs and symptoms of pancreatitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Vital signs

Liraglutide injection did not have adverse effects on blood pressure. Mean increases from baseline in heart rate of 2 to 3 beats per minute have been observed in adult patients treated with liraglutide injection compared to placebo.

10 OVERDOSAGE

In Study 1, a 10 year-old patient was administered a PANCREAZE dose of 12,399 lipase units/kg/day for the duration of the open-label and randomized withdrawal periods (21 days). The patient experienced mild abdominal pain throughout both study periods. Abnormal chemistry data at the end of the study included mild elevations of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and serum phosphate. Abnormal hematology data at the end of the study included mild elevations of hematocrit. No abnormalities from analyses of urinalysis or uric acid were noted.

Chronic high dosages of pancreatic enzyme products have been associated with fibrosing colonopathy and colonic strictures [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. High dosages of pancreatic enzyme products have been associated with hyperuricosuria and hyperuricemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

### Pancreatic-type hyperamylasemia and hyperlipasemia secondary to ruptured ovarian cyst: a case report and review of the literature [^1177DtrV]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Although salivary-type hyperamylasemia is known to occur with ovarian pathologies such as salpingitis and adenocarcinoma, pancreatic-type hyperamylasemia and hyperlipasemia are considered to be highly specific for pancreatitis.

Objectives

To discuss the interpretation of hyperamylasemia in the context of acute abdominal pain, implications for management, and to review the literature relating to non-pancreatic causes of hyperamylasemia and hyperlipasemia.

Case Report

We present the case of a 25-year-old woman who presented with an acute abdomen and a markedly elevated pancreatic-type amylase and lipase in whom acute pancreatitis was suspected. Further investigations showed that the underlying pathology was actually a ruptured ovarian cyst causing massive intra-abdominal hemorrhage and necessitating emergency laparotomy.

Conclusions

This case represents an initial report of pancreatic-type hyperamylasemia and hyperlipasemia occurring with ovarian pathology and hemoperitoneum. Although these derangements may have been secondary to peritoneal irritation, this case raises the possibility that ovarian tissue is able to secrete large amounts of pancreatic-type amylase and lipase in addition to salivary-type amylase. Clinicians should be aware that simultaneous elevations of both enzymes are not necessarily pathognomic of acute pancreatitis.

### Pancreatitis causing death in bulimia nervosa [^1146vsR8]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

We report the case of a 19-year-old woman with bulimia nervosa who died of acute hemorrhagic pancreatitis. Our objective is to raise awareness that because the symptoms of both conditions are very similar, the pre-existence of an eating disorder should not distract physicians from the possibility that potentially lethal acute pancreatitis may coexist.

Method

The study includes autopsy results and a review of the literature.

Results

Pancreatitis usually presents with abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting.

Discussion

In patients with eating disorders who may already have exhibited these symptoms pancreatitis may not be considered. Elevated serum amylase values may occur in subjects with bulimia nervosa without pancreatitis. If the serum amylase value is elevated, pancreatitis can be confirmed by measuring the levels of serum lipase, trypsinogen, pancreatic isoenzyme of amylase, or by abdominal computerized tomography (CT).

### Acute pancreatitis in childhood: a 10-year experience from A Thai university surgical center [^115pmuWc]. Pancreas (2022). Medium credibility.

The better sensitivity of elevation in serum lipase as an aid to timely diagnosis is likely a result of the degree of pancreatic insult and inflammatory response. Thus, to diagnose acute pancreatitis, a previous study concluded that serum lipase titer alone is sufficient. The co-ordering of both serum lipase and amylase has shown little to no increase in the diagnostic yield of illness. Taken together, here both serum lipase and amylase levels were not associated with severity of illness as defined by pancreatitis-related complications in our study. Furthermore, both enzymes had poor sensitivity and specificity to accurately predict prolonged LOS or mortality. Imaging is crucially needed to diagnose acute pancreatitis when the clinical setting is unclear in an effort to determine the underlying cause of pancreatitis, evaluate complications and disease severity, and to guide appropriate targeted intervention. Ultrasonography is a convenient and noninvasive diagnostic test to diagnose acute pancreatitis and confirm potential causes such as choledochal cyst and screening for pancreatitis-related complications, notably, pseudocyst. However, recent studies demonstrate the higher sensitivity of CT and magnetic resonance imaging when compared with ultrasonography (78%–90% vs 52%–70%) and that these they are most likely beneficial in those patients with a complicated clinical course. We noted that 53 of 79 patients in our study had ultrasonography (67.1%) and/or CT scan (98%), whereas 68% had evidence of acute pancreatitis on initial imaging without the predictive ability to distinguish which patients would develop later complications (P = 0.24). Thoeniproposed that CT imaging is not indicated in patients who are clinically classified as having acute mild pancreatitis and show rapid improvement with appropriate medical management. The British Society of Gastroenterology guidelines recommend additional follow-up imaging in patients with clinical status deterioration or failure to show continued improvement. As study authors, we found that follow-up imaging mainly detected pancreatitis-related complications such as pseudocyst and necrotizing pancreatitis (a total of 10 of 53 patients who underwent radiologic investigation).

### Best practices guidelines for trauma center recognition of child abuse, elder abuse, and intimate partner violence [^116JNcxc]. ACS (2019). High credibility.

Child physical abuse — duodenal injuries and laboratory screening states that duodenal injuries in young children from blunt force to the upper abdomen are considered a sentinel injury of PCA, and 100% of duodenal injuries in children under 2 years of age and 54% in children 3–5 years old were as a result of physical abuse. An elevated serum amylase or lipase (> 100 U/L) can indicate the diagnosis, and an upper gastrointestinal (GI) study often provides the most useful information. When clinical suspicion for abdominal trauma is low, screen for occult abdominal injury with measurement of serum ALT, AST, and pancreatic enzymes; one study of nearly 3,000 children reported a sensitivity of 84% and specificity of 83% for abdominal injury when an AST or ALT is greater than 80 IU/L. Elevated transaminases are indicative of severe blunt force trauma, not necessarily liver injury, and the specificity of elevated pancreatic enzymes is similarly high for possible pancreatic injury, as occurs with unintentional injuries.

### Recognition and management of persistent chylomicronemia: a joint expert clinical consensus by the National Lipid Association and the American Society for Preventive Cardiology [^112ceUpg]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2025). High credibility.

Persistent chylomicronemia (PC) subtype 4 without alarm features — risk and management: Observational data in this group showed a high occurrence (26%) of potentially preventable TG-induced pancreatitis, so these patients need to be offered intensive lifestyle modifications, treatment of causes of secondary hypertriglyceridemia, treatment with conventional TG-lowering medications including combination therapy if needed, and frequent TG monitoring with patient education. Efforts should be made to identify individuals at greatest risk of pancreatitis within this group (eg, a history of pancreatitis, positive genetic testing in TG metabolism pathways or high polygenic score for TG, or TG > 2000 mg/dL), and abdominal pain episodes should be carefully evaluated for pancreatitis by measuring TG at the time of abdominal pain, checking plasma amylase and/or lipase, and imaging the pancreas as clinically indicated. Recurrent episodes of pancreatitis or abdominal pain with no other etiology will reclassify these patients to higher risk categories (PC with alarm features).

### Annular pancreas concurrent with pancreaticobiliary maljunction presented with symptoms until adult age: case report with comparative data on pediatric cases [^115LiBYv]. BMC Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Case presentation

The patient, a 26-year-old man, presented to our department with abdominal pain. He was born at 40 weeks' gestational age with a birth weight of 3,010 g. Since his 3 years of age, the patient presented with relatively greater appetite compared with corresponding age cohorts and wiggly epigastric mass which would disappear two hours after meal. He remained free from vomiting and acute abdomen until the first episode of abdominal pain at the age of 23 years. Since then, he underwent totally 3 episodes of acute abdomen, and was diagnosed with acute pancreatitis.

On presentation, physical examination revealed tender epigastrium without palpable mass and jaundice. Laboratory data showed abnormal liver and pancreatic function tests with elevated serum levels of aspartate aminotransferase (85 U/L; normal range, 0–40 U/L), alanine aminotransferase (72 U/L; normal range, 0–40 U/L), total bilirubin (32.7 μmol/L; normal range, 0–19.5 μmol/L), amylase (541 U/L; normal range, 25–125 U/L) and lipase (279 U/L; normal range, < 190 U/L). Abdominal sonography revealed a dilated common bile duct. Computerized tomography additionally showed the dilation of proximal duodenum with stenosis at the distal end of descending duodenum. Magnetic resonance imaging and cholangiopancreatography revealed fusiform dilatation of the common bile duct with high confluence of pancreaticobiliary ducts with a common channel measured 24 mm in length (Figure 1 A, B). Endoscopy showed an enlarged pylorus and excessively ectatic duodenal cavity, but endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was not successful due to duodenal stenosis at the descending part (Figure 2). A tentative diagnosis of acute pancreatitis associated with pancreaticobiliary maljunction and annular pancreas was made.

### Benign pancreatic hyperenzymemia, also known as gullo's syndrome [^117RZZYn]. Laboratory Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Benign pancreatic hyperenzymemia, also known as Gullo's syndrome, is a little-known syndrome first described in 1996 in patients studied for an elevation of pancreatic enzymes while otherwise being asymptomatic. We describe the case of a 2-year-old patient who was found to have significant elevation of amylase and lipase levels while he was asymptomatic. Blood tests and imaging tests were performed to determine the etiology, but they gave normal results. The enzyme elevation can even be 10 times the normal value of the enzyme, and only 1 enzyme may elevate, although most often all pancreatic enzymes are elevated. The etiology is not known, although several hypotheses have been suggested. This enzyme elevation is described both in adults and children and also sporadically or with a familial pattern. Knowledge of it can limit the performance of the multiple complementary test, some of which are very invasive in patients who have elevated pancreatic enzymes while they are asymptomatic. It knowledge allows us to confirm a benign prognosis about it and reassure the family about this disease and that in the end it will not require aggressive treatments such as surgery or chemotherapy.

### Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) clinical practice guideline on immune checkpoint inhibitor-related adverse events [^116XyMKE]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2021). High credibility.

Immune checkpoint inhibitor–associated acute pancreatitis — follow-up and treatment recommendations specify that patients with persistent (> 4 weeks) or recurrent symptoms of acute pancreatitis should receive repeat abdominal CT with contrast to evaluate for possible consequences and should also be evaluated for non-pancreatic etiologies of lipase or amylase elevation. Patients with elevated lipase or amylase but no other symptoms of acute pancreatitis should be monitored closely for the development of acute pancreatitis but should continue on immunotherapy. Prednisone (0.5–1 mg/kg/day) or equivalent may be considered if no improvement of symptoms occurs within 3–5 days of supportive treatment, and these patients should also be referred to a GI specialist.

### Interpretation of serum pancreatic enzymes in pancreatic and nonpancreatic conditions [^114UnGxW]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Serum levels of amylase and lipase can be elevated in nonpancreatic conditions that may or may not be associated with abdominal pain. This leads to a large proportion of patients being falsely labeled as having acute pancreatitis. In this review, we aim to summarize the existing evidence on pancreatic enzyme elevation in various pancreatic and nonpancreatic conditions and its practical implications in clinical practice and healthcare.

Recent Findings

Serum amylase and lipase levels are not specific for pancreatitis. Attempts have been made to validate newer biomarkers including pancreatic elastase, serum trypsin, urinary trypsinogen-activated peptide, phospholipase A2, carboxypeptidase B, activated peptide of carboxypeptidase B, the trypsin 2 alpha 1 activation complex, and circulating cell-free DNA for the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis.

Summary

Serum lipase levels can be elevated in many intra-abdominal inflammatory conditions. Although more sensitive and specific than amylase, serum lipase levels are not sufficient to diagnose acute pancreatitis in patients with abdominal pain. There is a need to increase stress on radiological evidence as well increase cut-off levels of enzyme elevation for a more accurate diagnosis of acute pancreatitis.

### Urinary amylase / urinary creatinine ratio (uAm / uCr) – a less-invasive parameter for management of hyperamylasemia [^11232ibk]. BMC Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Discussion

In the diagnosis and management of pancreatic disorders, measurement of sAm has played a central role since Elman et al. demonstrated the value of sAm in diagnosis of pancreatitis. However, it is also true that sAm has problems with respect to diagnostic ability. Estimates of the sensitivity of amylase range from 60% to 98%, although it is difficult to estimate because elevated sAm itself is frequently used as a diagnostic criterion. Furthermore, almost 40% of patients under 3 years of age with a diagnosis of acute pancreatitis were reported to have normal amylase but elevated lipase levels. This erratic low sensitivity of sAm has been explained as resulting from the short half-life of amylase in the serum. The specificity of sAm is also not high enough to use as a screening parameter for pancreatic disorders. While hyperamylasemia is often seen in various pancreatic diseases, extrapancreatic factors also result in hyperamylasemia (salivary disease, gastrointestinal disease, gynecologic disease, extra-pancreatic tumors, and others). Hyperamylasemia was found in 9.7% of patients with appendicitis, 9.3% of patients with acute cholecystitis, and 16.0% of patients with a perforated peptic ulcer. To compensate for the incomplete diagnostic ability of sAm, other pancreatic enzymes have been proposed. In particular, the serum level of lipase is a comparable marker of pancreatic disease, but rapid and cost-effective measurement systems are not broadly available. Urinary trypsinogen-2 strip test has also drawn attention recently for early detection of pancreatitis, but is not quantitative and less sensitive. Therefore, sAm has some issues concerning its use, but has been used broadly as practical marker of pancreatic disorders.

### Coeliac disease masquerading as macroamylasaemia [^111RUgKL]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Background

Macroamylasaemia (MA) is a biochemical disorder characterised by hyperamylasaemia without elevated urinary amylase and no associated signs or symptoms. Serum amylase is primarily released from the pancreas (40%–45%) and salivary glands (55%–60%), with its clearance occurring through the kidneys (25%) and the reticuloendothelial system (75%).MA results from circulating complexes of amylase bound to macromolecules, such as immunoglobulins and polysaccharides, forming macroamylase complexes that cannot be cleared by the renal glomeruli. This condition may present as an isolated, benign phenomenon without pathological significance or may occur in association with inflammatory disorders, including coeliac disease (CD), inflammatory bowel diseases, rheumatoid arthritis, haematological malignancies and monoclonal gammopathy. The prevalence of MA is approximately 2.5% among patients with hyperamylasaemia. Some studies have observed the association between MA and CD as well as the disappearance of MA with a gluten-free diet (GFD). Here, we describe a patient in whom persistent hyperamylasaemia was attributed to CD.

### Benign pancreatic hyperenzymemia [^116aaAGj]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2007). Low credibility.

Benign pancreatic hyperenzymemia is a newly identified syndrome characterized by an abnormal increase in serum pancreatic enzymes in the absence of pancreatic disease. The hyperenzymemia can occur sporadically or in a familial form, and all of the pancreatic enzymes show elevations. Although the condition is persistent, the enzyme elevations fluctuate considerably, even temporarily returning to normal levels at times. In this review the main characteristics of this syndrome are described.

### Macro-AST: misleading finding in an adolescent with MCAD-deficiency [^115QXPT4]. BMC Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

In summary, we describe a girl with MCAD-deficiency developing isolated AST-elevation without any clinical or biochemical signs for organ dysfunction. We could detect macro-AST as the cause of AST-elevation.

Macro-AST has to be considered in any healthy individual or patient with a chronic disease displaying an isolated AST-elevation. This goes for patients with chronic metabolic diseases like MCAD-deficiency as well. Thus, unnecessary costly and invasive evaluation can be avoided. In our opinion, MCAD-patients should be regularly followed. Apart from dealing with acute health problems this will allow us to study the long-term biochemical and clinical outcome in patients with this rare disease diagnosed by neonatal mass screening.

The diagnostic difficulties encountered in disease of the pancreas because of its inaccessibility to physical and roentgenologic examination and lack of simple biochemical tests, such as those used in the detection of diseases of the hepatobiliary tract, are well known. A fairly satisfactory approach to this problem has been the use of tests of pancreatic function. 1 In essence, most tests of pancreatic function deal mainly with the detection of disturbances in pancreatic enzyme concentration in the duodenal contents following hormonal stimulation. Such studies have proved invaluable in the detection of pancreatic insufficiency in chronic disease of the pancreas but are of extremely limited value in the patient with acute illness. 2 In practice, the study of impaired external pancreatic function by analysis of duodenal contents is too time consuming, cumbersome, and, most of all, distasteful to the patient.

Gastrointestinal effects — pancreatitis associated with antiretroviral therapy: Pancreatitis is rare, but may occur with NRTIs or RTV-boosted PIs, with onset at any time, usually after months of therapy. Risk factors include use of concomitant medications that are associated with pancreatitis (e.g. TMP-SMX, pentamidine, ribavirin). For prevention/monitoring, measure serum amylase and lipase concentrations if persistent abdominal pain develops. Management is to discontinue offending agent and avoid reintroduction, and manage symptoms of acute episodes.

DIAGNOSIS OF AND DETERMINATION OF THE ETIOLOGY AP

The diagnosis of AP in this patient is straightforward. He is presenting with characteristic abdominal pain with a markedly elevated lipase. A computed tomography (CT) scan is not needed in this patient. It will not assist in diagnosis nor be useful in predicting severity, especially as most patients (80%) will improve. CT should be reserved for the patient who presents with atypical symptoms and/or mild elevations of the amylase/lipase which could be nonspecific.

The etiology of the AP in this patient is not clear. Identifying the etiology is important for potentially preventing recurrent pancreatitis. Biliary and alcohol are the most common causes of AP. Although the US is indicated as an initial evaluation of AP, the negative examination does not rule out biliary etiology. A stone in the gallbladder may have passed to the common bile duct and be missed by the US whether it has or has not passed to the duodenum. Although initial US may be negative, given prevalence of biliary pancreatitis, the examination should be repeated on an outpatient basis if no other etiology is found. Alcohol is a common cause of AP but requires a relatively large amount of alcohol (50 g) consumption over multiple years to cause pancreatic disease. Could a medication, such as semaglutide, have caused the AP? Not likely, as there is little evidence that most medications cause AP. Although the triglyceride is lower than 1,000 mg/dL, an outpatient repeat evaluation will be needed. Given the patient's age, there is a small but real risk of a tumor causing AP, an outpatient magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography should be performed if no etiology is identified. It is common that no etiology is identified. Such patients are correctly identified as having idiopathic AP whose further management is complex and controversial.

### Coeliac disease masquerading as macroamylasaemia [^111mJEXT]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

CD is an immune-mediated response to ingested gluten, leading to varying degrees of villous atrophy and flattening of the small intestinal mucosa. Detection of CD-specific antibodies in the serum is valuable for the initial screening of suspected cases. An intestinal biopsy is required in most patients to confirm a diagnosis. The diagnosis of MA in patients with isolated, elevated amylase levels can be established by determining the molecular weight of serum amylase using immunologic assays or the amylase-to-creatinine clearance ratio (ACCR). In patients with MA, the ACCR is reduced because of the poor filtration of large macroamylase complexes. In the absence of renal failure, a low ACCR is indicative of MA. The ratio is calculated using the following formula: ACCR = amylase(urine)×creatinine (serum)×100/amylase(serum)×creatinine (urine). A ratio of less than 1% in a 24-hour collection supports the diagnosis of MA, indicating poor clearance of amylase by the kidney (normal 3%–4%). Patients with acute or recurrent pancreatitis were excluded. The patient had normal renal function and serum lipase levels, with an ACCR ratio of 0.16%.

MA was first called as such by Berk in 1967, who described it as 'a biochemical aberration in the search for a disease' due to time-consuming methods of analysis and a lack of obvious clinical implications.MA is generally asymptomatic. In some cases, it may be detected incidentally during investigations of abdominal pain. Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain this association, including increased intestinal permeability. Some authors have suggested that the abdominal pain may be attributed to the deposition of macroamylase molecules in the pancreas. However, this observation does not confirm an association between the two. In patients with unexplained hyperamylasaemia without evidence of pancreatitis, MA should be assessed to avoid unnecessary diagnostic tests and treatment; if MA is present, the possibility of CD should be considered.MA associated with CD has been described in adult patients. A GFD may lead to significant improvement in MA. However, Rabsztyn et al found that MA levels remained elevated in some patients on a GFD. This is consistent with our case, as in 3-year follow-up, the serial serum amylase levels did not normalise despite a strict GFD, as evident by the normalisation of tissue transglutaminase (TTG) level.

### Routine measurement of pleural fluid amylase is not indicated… [^117SMZ8L]. JAMA Network (2001). Excellent credibility.

To assess the utility of routine measurement of pleural fluid amylase in evaluating pleural effusions, we measured amylase, glucose, lactate dehydrogenase, and protein levels and blood cell counts in 379 patients undergoing thoracentesis during a 22-month period from 1997 to 1999. The amylase, glucose, protein, and lactate dehyrogenase measurements were made using an automated analyzer. These studies were performed according to protocol for all effusions for which consent was obtained, regardless of whether the clinician formally ordered them. Results were provided and patients were billed only for those studies actually ordered by the clinician. The normal range for serum amylase levels in our laboratory is 30 to 110 U/L. Standard definitions were used for identifying the cause of the pleural effusion.

1. Determining the pleural fluid amylase levels did not assist in making the diagnosis in any of the patients.

Of the 379 patients we studied, amylase levels greater than 100 U/L were found in only 5 patients. This effusion resolved with simple diuresis and did not recur. Patient 2 had a loculated hemothorax with an amylase level of 144 U/L that was drained 3 days after coronary artery bypass graft surgery. Although this effusion was initially thought to have resolved, he was readmitted 3 months later with dyspnea, recurrent effusion, and weight loss. The final diagnosis was severe ischemic cardiomyopathy and cardiac cachexia. Patient 3 had a large-volume bloody effusion 6 days following CABG surgery that had an amylase level of 130 U/L. His effusion completely resolved with thoracentesis and did not recur. Patient 4 had a parapneumonic effusion with a borderline elevation of the pleural fluid amylase level. Of the 1437 total effusions evaluated, only 89 had elevated amylase levels.

The most common causes in these series include malignancy, pancreatitis, pneumonia, tuberculosis, cirrhosis, and esophageal rupture.

Table 1
Baseline characteristics of the sample population

Data are presented as the mean (age), absolute numbers and percentage (%). * One-way ANOVA was used to calculate the P-value. All values except for "Age" are calculated with the Chi-square test.

Elevated blood levels of pancreatic enzymes such as lipase and amylase are typically documented during pancreatic injury. Given its rather long-lasting elevated levels, pancreatic lipase plasma levels not only render as the favored circulating diagnostic biomarker for pancreatic injury in terms of sensitivity and diagnostic window but is also a useful diagnostic biomarker in the early and late stages of pancreatitis –.

In our experimental setting, pancreatic lipase plasma levels aided in significantly stratify patients according to the severity in three groups (healthy vs severe and healthy vs critical, p < 0.0001; severe vs critical, p = 0.041) (Fig. 1b). Significant discrimination between the critical and severe groups was also achieved upon measuring pancreatic amylase, a less specific biomarker for pancreatic damage (Fig. 1e). Moreover, plasma levels of both pancreatic enzymes, indicative of pancreatic damage, exhibited a significant correlation between themselves (r = 0.46, p < 0.0001) (Fig. S4a).

The normal blood levels of amylase and lipase are 0–90 U/L and 0–70 U/L, respectively. Interestingly, the number of patients classified according to the levels of these enzymes in moderate or elevated, mirrored the magnitude of COVID-19 disease. Patients with higher pancreatic lipase blood levels than baseline (hyperlipasemia) showed a 3-fold increase (Fig. 1c) while patients with higher amylase levels exhibited a 4-fold increase (Fig. 1f) when comparing critical vs severe COVID-19 patients. None of the healthy donors exhibited an increase of these enzymes (Fig. 1c, f) Notably, the differentiation of severity groups related to circulating pancreatic enzymes resembled the distribution of the inflammatory markers C-reactive protein (CRP) and DDimer that are hallmarks of severe COVID-19 (Fig. S4b, d). Moreover, the Pearson correlation demonstrated that levels of plasma pancreatic lipase significantly correlated with these two typically used clinical variables that discriminate severity-stratified groups, CRP (r = 0.27 p = 0.018) and D-Dimer (r = 0.47 p = 0.004) (Fig. S4c, e).

### A 5-year experience of benign pancreatic hyperenzymemia [^114vWqLq]. Pancreas (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

Benign pancreatic hyperenzymemia is characterized by a long-term increase of serum pancreatic enzymes in otherwise healthy subjects. This study was designed to determine (a) whether all pancreatic enzymes are elevated, (b) the extent of each enzyme increase, (c) the relative frequency of the familial form, and (d) the relative frequencies of pancreatic and salivary hyperamylasemia and macroamylasemia.

Methods

Two hundred seven asymptomatic subjects with benign pancreatic hyperenzymemia were studied during the 5-year period. Serum amylase, isoamylase, and lipase levels were assessed by immunoenzymatic assays.

Results

Most (n = 183; 88.4%) patients had benign pancreatic hyperenzymemia; 155 (74.9%) patients had an abnormal increase of all 3 enzymes, 15 (7.2%) patients of only lipase, and 13 (6.3%) patients of only amylase and pancreatic isoamylase. Lipase levels were the highest (1.1–21 times above upper limit). Of the 183 subjects, 72 were members of 35 different families, 15 (7.2%) had increased salivary amylase, and 9 (4.3%) had macroamylasemia. Wide day-to-day fluctuations of pancreatic enzymes, including falls within the reference ranges, were recorded.

Conclusions

All enzymes were increased in benign pancreatic hyperenzymemia, with lipase showing the highest elevation. Doctors should reassure patients about the benign nature of this condition and limit repeating useless examinations.

### Salmonella colitis as an unusual cause of elevated serum lipase [^117DZ3TJ]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Authors and clinicians advocate lipase as the preferred serological test for the diagnosis for acute pancreatitis. While acute pancreatitis is among the differential diagnosis for elevated lipase levels, several other causes of elevated lipase levels have been identified including several reports Salmonella species as a causative agent. There also have been retrospective studies that have reported clinical pancreatitis associated with Salmonella infection. These studies concluded that clinical pancreatitis should be considered as a complication of Salmonella infections. However, Salmonella infections may induce elevated pancreatic enzyme levels without clinical pancreatitis or morphological pancreatic abnormalities through a variety of proposed mechanisms. The following is a case that describes a patient who developed Salmonella colitis and demonstrated elevated serum lipase levels without clinical pancreatitis.

### Tramadol poisoning with hyperamylasemia [^112f5VZ8]. BMJ Case Reports (2010). Medium credibility.

The usual reason for measuring serum amylase level is to confirm or exclude the diagnosis of pancreatitis. However, increases in serum amylase levels can occur in conditions other than pancreatitis and many of those conditions present with acute abdominal pain. In the case presented here, an unconscious patient developed a very high serum total amylase level, which was most likely due to hypoxemia and lactic acidosis secondary to an overdose of Tramadol (Nobligan) tablets. The patient was treated in the intensive care unit and had an uneventful recovery. Many diseases can cause acute elevation of serum amylase level. In lactic acidosis, the hyperamylasemia typically results from the presence of excessive salivary-type isoamylase. Therefore, isoamylase enzyme analysis is of great clinical value in the differential diagnosis of hyperamylasemia, especially in cases with concurrent lactic acidosis.

### A case report of a salivary amylase secreting plasmacytoma in a patient with multiple myeloma [^111NwSsk]. BMJ Case Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

A 70-year-old lady with a past medical history of light chain myeloma, chronic renal failure and a left breast plasmacytoma treated with radiotherapy was admitted for drainage of a subsequent left pleural effusion. She was given high dose steroids for her myeloma, following which she developed abdominal pain suspicious of pancreatitis. Results revealed a raised serum amylase of 5117, a modified Glasgow score of 3 and normal calcium levels. The working diagnosis was drug-induced pancreatitis and steroids were stopped. She remained well and her abdominal pain settled, but amylase remained markedly raised despite no findings of pancreatic pathology. A subsequent isoenzyme test on the amylase found it to be salivary amylase secreted from the plasmacytoma. The patient had her steroid therapy restarted and was allowed to be discharged from hospital.

### Prospective validation of a prediction model for the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis [^111Dsfhc]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Does a novel prediction model that uses 8 nonimaging parameters diagnose acute pancreatitis in patients presenting to the emergency department with elevated serum lipase levels?

Findings

In this diagnostic study validating a prediction model, the model demonstrated excellent accuracy. At a score of at least 6 points, prediction model accuracy and performance were optimized, serious alternative diagnoses were uncommon, and diagnostic yield of early imaging was low.

Meaning

This prediction model may accurately diagnose acute pancreatitis and obviate the need for confirmatory diagnostic imaging in many patients.

### The relationship between biliary amylase and the clinical features of choledochal cysts in pediatric patients [^113sEmhD]. World Journal of Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Although the clinical features of choledochal cysts (CC) in different age groups have been widely studied, the causes of differences in clinical features are unknown. To determine the relationship between biliary amylase and the clinical features of CC in pediatric patients, clinical outcomes were compared in two groups with different amylase levels.

Methods

From May 1995 to August 2010, 80 patients under 18 years old who underwent choledochal cyst excision and hepaticojejunostomy and measurements of biliary amylase levels were allocated to a low-amylase-level group (amylase level < 200 U/L, n = 26) and a high-amylase-level group (amylase level > 200 U/L, n = 54). Their medical records were retrospectively reviewed.

Results

The median age was 4 months (range = 17 days-169 months) in the low group and 48 months (range = 22 days-147 months) in the high group (p = 0.008). In the low group, jaundice was the most common symptom, while abdominal pain was the main symptom in the high group. In histological findings, bile duct proliferation and cholestasis predominated in the low group and portal inflammation predominated in the high group. Radiological findings and preoperative laboratory data were also significantly different between the groups. Postoperative complications occurred in the high group only. There was no mortality in either group.

Conclusion

This study shows a relationship between biliary amylase level and clinical manifestations in pediatric patients with CC, implying that there are different underlying pathophysiologies with anomalous pancreaticobiliary ductal union (APBDU).

### Amylase and lipase measurements in paediatric patients with traumatic pancreatic injuries [^115eB5ik]. Injury (2009). Low credibility.

Introduction

Pancreatic injuries occur in up to 10% of paediatric patients who suffer blunt trauma. Initial amylase and lipase measurements have not been helpful as a screening tool to detect pancreatic injuries. However, one primarily adult study suggests that a delayed measurement may be useful.

Materials and Methods

A retrospective chart review was conducted of patients admitted to a Level I paediatric trauma centre from April 1996 to November 2006 with traumatic pancreatic injuries.

Results

The trauma database identified 51 patients with traumatic pancreatic injuries. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were met by 26 patients. Patients with initial amylase and lipase levels measured greater than 2h post-injury were more consistently elevated compared to those patients who had levels measured at 2h or less post-injury. There was a significant association between time of measurement and an increased amylase level (p = 0.012). No significant association was found for lipase measurements (p = 0.178).

Discussion and Conclusions

In children with blunt pancreatic injury, elevated serum amylase levels were seen in a significantly higher percentage of patients with initial measurements at greater than 2h post-injury compared to those measured at 2h or less. Lipase measurements demonstrated a similar trend. Delayed amylase and lipase measurements may be helpful to detect pancreatic injuries, but further study is needed.
