## Question

Microalbumin without diabetes

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the significance of microalbuminuria in people without diabetes, including how to define it, how common it is, what it means for cardiovascular and kidney outcomes, how to confirm it, and how to manage it. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the correct terminology and thresholds. Then, I should verify prevalence in non-diabetic populations. Next, I will examine prognostic implications for cardiovascular and renal outcomes. After that, I need to check the evidence base for screening and treatment, including ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and SGLT2 inhibitors. Finally, I will outline a practical, stepwise clinical approach and note limitations and controversies, making sure I confirm each claim with appropriate citations as I go.

> Let me first confirm the terminology and thresholds, because precision matters here. Historically, "microalbuminuria" meant 30–300 mg/g albumin-to-creatinine ratio on a spot urine, but wait, let me verify the current nomenclature. Contemporary guidelines have moved away from "microalbuminuria" and now categorize albuminuria as A1 normal to mildly increased (< 30 mg/g), A2 moderately increased (30–300 mg/g), and A3 severely increased (> 300 mg/g), which aligns with the old "micro" and "macro" concepts but uses standardized, quantitative language, so I should use A2 to denote the 30–300 mg/g range in non-diabetic adults [^40ebdfd3] [^4573468a].

> I need to check prevalence in people without diabetes, and I should double-check that I'm citing general-population data rather than diabetic cohorts. In the general population, moderately increased albuminuria (A2) is present in roughly 6–10%, and in hypertensive cohorts without diabetes it can be higher, around 11% in some series, with even larger proportions detected when lower thresholds are considered, which underscores that risk tracks across the albuminuria spectrum rather than only above 30 mg/g [^a2549d8f] [^3495ffa9] [^c2299451].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about causality; I should confirm prognostic meaning. In non-diabetic adults, A2 albuminuria independently associates with higher risks of cardiovascular events and mortality, and importantly, this risk appears even at levels below the traditional 30 mg/g threshold, supporting a continuous relationship between albuminuria and adverse outcomes rather than a binary cut point [^e36adb8b] [^c2299451] [^ce4f4af9].

> Next, I should review renal implications in people without diabetes. Let me verify whether A2 predicts incident CKD or GFR decline in this group. Observational data, including PREVEND, show that higher baseline albumin excretion predicts impaired GFR over time in non-diabetic individuals, and even isolated A2 (without hypertension, diabetes, or CVD) signals higher risks of incident hypertension and diabetes, reinforcing its role as a systemic vascular risk marker rather than purely a kidney test [^7d8e5676] [^93322c07].

> I will now examine the evidence for screening in non-diabetic adults, and I need to ensure I distinguish population screening from targeted testing. Major bodies like USPSTF and ACP have historically found insufficient evidence for universal CKD screening without risk factors, yet cardiology and nephrology guidance increasingly endorse measuring albuminuria in higher-risk non-diabetic patients, such as those with hypertension, CVD, or family history, and some advocate periodic ACR testing in all adults given the prognostic value and potential for intervention, so I should frame this as risk-stratified screening rather than blanket testing [^7d8e5676] [^50ea5221] [^16f7b6c2].

> Let me think about confirmation, because albuminuria has substantial biological variability. I should confirm that diagnosis of A2 requires at least two additional first-morning ACR measurements over 3–6 months, with two of three results in the 30–300 mg/g range, and I need to exclude transient causes like fever, exercise, or UTI before labeling someone as having persistent albuminuria, which is standard practice even outside diabetes [^130f9e9b] [^3e2ccc9d].

> Now, management: I should verify what therapies have evidence in non-diabetic A2. Blood pressure control to < 130/80 mmHg is reasonable when albuminuria is present, and renin–angiotensin system blockade with ACE inhibitors or ARBs reduces albuminuria and slows progression in proteinuric kidney disease; while much of the strongest outcome data are in diabetic or overtly proteinuric non-diabetic CKD, albuminuria reduction with ACEi/ARB is still recommended in non-diabetic patients with A2, with titration to maximally tolerated doses and monitoring of creatinine and potassium, and SGLT2 inhibitors have robust kidney and cardiovascular benefits in non-diabetic CKD with A3, with emerging but still limited data in A2, so I should be cautious about extrapolating SGLT2 use to A2 alone outside trials [^5448dc7c] [^39a45ed1] [^50ea5221].

> But wait, what if the patient has A2 without hypertension or diabetes — should I still treat? Observational data in isolated A2 show higher risks of CVD and incident hypertension/diabetes, and some experts argue for proactive risk modification even in this scenario, though randomized trial evidence for hard outcomes is limited; therefore, I should individualize decisions, consider ACEi/ARB when hypertension is present or when A2 is accompanied by other risk factors, and prioritize lifestyle and blood pressure optimization while acknowledging the evidence gap [^93322c07] [^39a45ed1].

> I should double-check that I'm not overpromising reversibility. Spontaneous regression of A2 can occur, and in some cohorts up to 30–50% revert, so persistence should be confirmed before committing to long-term pharmacotherapy, and I need to ensure we continue to address global cardiovascular risk factors like lipids, smoking, weight, and glycemia even when diabetes is not present [^d6e7a98a] [^e2e51282].

> Let me reconsider the overall message to ensure internal consistency. In people without diabetes, moderately increased albuminuria (A2, 30–300 mg/g) is a validated, independent risk marker for cardiovascular events, mortality, and incident CKD, with risk beginning even below 30 mg/g; targeted screening is reasonable in higher-risk non-diabetic adults, confirmation requires repeat testing, and management should focus on blood pressure control and renin–angiotensin blockade when indicated, with SGLT2 inhibitors reserved for those with more advanced albuminuria or established CKD where benefit is proven, while recognizing that evidence for hard outcomes in isolated A2 is still evolving [^e36adb8b] [^c2299451] [^39a45ed1] [^50ea5221].

Microalbuminuria without diabetes is defined as a **urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) of 30–300 mg/g** [^40ebdfd3] in the absence of diabetes and reflects early kidney or vascular injury [^4edc276c]. It is a **strong, independent risk marker** for cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease in non-diabetic individuals [^93322c07] [^e36adb8b] [^7d8e5676]. Prevalence is about 6–10% in the general population [^a2549d8f] and higher with hypertension, obesity, or metabolic syndrome [^notfound]. Confirm with two additional first-morning ACRs over 3–6 months [^130f9e9b], then evaluate for hypertension, CKD, and cardiovascular risk; treat with blood pressure control, lifestyle changes, and consider ACE inhibitors or ARBs if hypertension or CKD is present [^5448dc7c] [^39a45ed1].

---

## Definition and diagnostic criteria

Microalbuminuria is defined as a **urinary albumin excretion of 30–300 mg/day** [^40ebdfd3] or an ACR of 30–300 mg/g (3.4–34 mg/mmol) in a spot urine sample [^a3dd7746]. In non-diabetic individuals, it is diagnosed when these values are confirmed on at least two of three first-morning samples over 3–6 months [^130f9e9b], with no evidence of diabetes or other transient causes (e.g. UTI, exercise, fever) [^3e2ccc9d].

---

## Prevalence and risk factors

Prevalence in the general non-diabetic population is approximately 6–10% [^a2549d8f] and increases with:

- **Hypertension**: 15–20% in untreated hypertension [^notfound].
- **Obesity/metabolic syndrome**: Higher prevalence with insulin resistance [^notfound].
- **Age**: More common in older adults [^notfound].
- **Smoking**: Associated with increased risk [^e36adb8b].

---

## Clinical significance and prognosis

Microalbuminuria without diabetes is a **marker of generalized endothelial dysfunction** [^a2549d8f] and increased cardiovascular risk [^ce4f4af9]. It independently predicts:

- **Cardiovascular disease**: 1.5–2.5-fold higher risk of CVD events and mortality [^notfound].
- **Hypertension**: Higher incidence and progression risk [^93322c07].
- **Chronic kidney disease**: Early marker of CKD and predictor of progression [^7d8e5676].

---

## Pathophysiology

The mechanism involves **endothelial dysfunction** with increased glomerular permeability and systemic vascular injury [^a2549d8f]; inflammation and oxidative stress contribute to both renal and cardiovascular damage [^notfound].

---

## Diagnostic approach

- **Screening**: Consider in non-diabetic adults with hypertension, obesity, metabolic syndrome, or CVD risk factors [^7d8e5676].
- **Confirmation**: Repeat two first-morning ACRs over 3–6 months [^130f9e9b].
- **Evaluation**: Assess blood pressure, renal function (eGFR), and cardiovascular risk profile [^50ea5221].

---

## Management strategies

- **Blood pressure control**: Target < 130/80 mmHg; use ACE inhibitors or ARBs if hypertension or CKD is present [^5448dc7c] [^39a45ed1].
- **Lifestyle modifications**: Weight loss, dietary sodium restriction, smoking cessation, and regular exercise [^c2299451].
- **Monitoring**: Annual ACR and eGFR; more frequent if CKD or hypertension is present [^50ea5221].

---

## Controversies and limitations

- **Screening utility**: Universal screening is debated; targeted screening in high-risk groups is reasonable [^7d8e5676].
- **Treatment evidence**: Direct RCT evidence for ACEi/ARB benefit in non-diabetic microalbuminuria is limited; benefits are inferred from CVD/CKD data [^39a45ed1].
- **Variability**: ACR has ~20% biological variability; confirm persistent elevation before acting [^notfound].

---

Microalbuminuria without diabetes signals **early vascular and renal injury** and higher risks of CVD, hypertension, and CKD. Confirm with repeat testing, assess cardiovascular and renal risk, and manage with blood pressure control, lifestyle changes, and ACE inhibitors or ARBs when indicated [^5448dc7c] [^39a45ed1].

Purpose Of Review

This review summarizes recent work that has explored the association between microalbuminuria and adverse clinical outcomes in the presence and absence of diabetes.

Recent Findings

Recent investigations have documented the prevalence of microalbuminuria in the general community and have also highlighted the continuous relationship between the level of urinary albumin excretion and clinical endpoints. Even below traditional microalbuminuria thresholds, urinary albumin levels appear to correlate with clinical outcomes. Microalbuminuria is becoming increasingly recognized as an independent risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. At least for subjects with type 2 diabetes and microalbuminuria, intensive, multifactorial interventions can reduce the risk of cardiovascular events by about 50%. Although several studies have found an association between microalbuminuria and surrogate measurements of vascular disease, the exact molecular mechanisms linking an increase in urinary albumin excretion and vascular disease are still unknown. Microalbuminuria also has a well-documented association with progressive diabetic renal disease but recent studies have suggested that the prognostic significance of microalbuminuria in this regard may not be as powerful as originally reported.

Summary

Aggressive, multifactorial interventions, including the use of drugs that interrupt the renin-angiotensin system are strongly recommended for patients with diabetes and micro-albuminuria to ameliorate the progression of renal and vascular complications. This approach should also possibly apply to microalbuminuric subjects without diabetes. The relationship between microalbuminuria and progressive diabetic renal disease requires re-evaluation given temporal trends in the prevention and treatment of diabetic complications.

### Screening, monitoring, and treatment of albuminuria: public health perspectives [^4edc276c]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2006). Low credibility.

Microalbuminuria is an early sign of progressive cardiovascular and renal disease in individuals with and without diabetes. Despite compelling data, at present only a minority of patients with diabetes and rarely individuals without diabetes are screened for albuminuria in a systematic way. All of the criteria to implement systematic albuminuria screening are fulfilled in diabetes, and most are nearly fulfilled for microalbuminuria screening in individuals without diabetes. Because of the growing evidence that treatment of microalbuminuria in individuals without diabetes may offer a cost-effective benefit to prevent cardiovascular disease, nephrologists and other health care providers should pay more attention to the early detection and subsequent treatment of individuals with microalbuminuria.

### 'Progressive diabetic nephropathy. how useful is microalbuminuria?: contra' [^f7ad492d]. Kidney International (2014). Low credibility.

The concept of microalbuminuria has been central to the development of clinical practice and research in the area of diabetic kidney disease (DKD). However, in recent times, the value of a paradigm of DKD based solely on microalbuminuria has been questioned. Although both the absolute level and rate of change of microalbuminuria are linked to the development and progression of DKD, microalbuminuria on its own lacks the necessary sensitivity or specificity to accurately predict kidney outcomes for people with diabetes. The development of microalbumiuria can no longer be viewed as a committed and irreversible stage of DKD, as spontaneous remission is now reported as a common occurrence. In addition, the absence of microalbuminuria or its progression to proteinuria does not signify that an individual patient is safe from a progressive decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Furthermore, although reductions in albuminuria within the microalbuminuric range can be linked to a slower GFR decline in observational studies, this relationship has not been robustly demonstrated in intervention studies. Conclusions regarding the kidney health of individuals with diabetes will continue to be flawed if an inappropriate emphasis is placed on the presence or absence of albuminuria or changes in albuminuria within the microalbuminuric range. This has important implications in terms of undermining the value of microalbuminuria as a surrogate renal end point for intervention trials. There is a need to develop broader models of progressive DKD that include novel pathways and risk markers apart from those related to the traditional 'albuminuric pathway' to renal impairment.

Albuminuria as a surrogate marker—KDOQI notes that relationships between glomerular structural lesions and the presence or absence of microalbuminuria in diabetes are not straightforward, intrapatient variability in albuminuria measurements is large with controversy about standardization, and therefore the evidence for using albuminuria as a surrogate marker for clinical outcomes was not sufficiently strong to merit a guideline statement.

### Microalbuminuria constitutes a clinical action item for clinicians in 2021 [^16f7b6c2]. The American Journal of Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Chronic kidney disease affects approximately 10% of the population or 800 million people globally, with diabetes being the leading cause. The presence of chronic kidney disease with impaired kidney function or with albuminuria is associated with an increased risk of a progressive loss of renal function and increased risk of cardiovascular disease and excess mortality. Screening for chronic kidney disease is critically important because during the initial stages patients often have no symptoms and because we now have available recently approved multiple interventions that can reduce the high risks dramatically. Screening should be performed with regular measurement of albumin in the urine and creatinine or cystatin C in blood for estimation of kidney function. Regretfully recent data indicates that screening for albuminuria is conducted in only 20%-50% of people at risk depending on the setting. Clinicians need to perform regular screening and concomitant management of risk factors. Recent therapeutic options must be implemented to improve outcomes. Finally, a reduction in albuminuria after initiation of intervention constitutes a treatment target because it indicates improved prognosis.

### KDOQI clinical practice guidelines and clinical practice recommendations for diabetes and chronic kidney disease [^d6e7a98a]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2007). Medium credibility.

Microalbuminuria course and classification guidance states that as many as 30% to 50% of microalbuminuric patients may revert to normoalbuminuria, the ADA do not specifically recommend use of a first morning urine sample or overnight collections and postural microalbuminuria or proteinuria may be a confounding factor, particularly in young type 1 patients; patients who are persistently normoalbuminuric tend to be at low risk of DKD, whereas microalbuminuric patients have a 3- to 4-fold increased risk; and, for classification purposes, the Work Group recommends that health care providers consider as macroalbuminuric all patients who have been diagnosed as such before ACE-inhibitor and/or ARB treatment.

### Microalbuminuria: do we need a new threshold? [^c2299451]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2009). Low credibility.

Microalbuminuria (30-300 mg of albumin/24 h) is a well-known independent risk factor for kidney and cardiovascular disease and of mortality in diabetic, hypertensive and in the general population. However, recent studies indicate that increased risk is observed at levels of albuminuria much lower than those currently employed to define microalbuminuria. Such low levels were shown to predict heart disease and death, independent of age, sex, renal function, diabetes, hypertension and lipids, in subjects with cardiovascular disease, hypertension and in the general population; as well as to predict progression to hypertension. Correction of obesity and metabolic derangements lowered levels of albuminuria below 30 mg/24 h to levels not associated with increased risk (5-7 mg/24 h). Despite the lack of outcome studies, there is substantial evidence to indicate that the threshold for defining microalbuminuria (that is, albuminuria associated with increased risk) should be lowered by nearly three to four-fold from the currently defined threshold. It would be advisable that clinical scores and future guidelines would consider including microalbuminuria at the lower rates as an independent risk factor, and as an indication for implementing early intervention. Unfortunately, and despite the abundance of evidence, albuminuria measurements are still underutilized in clinical practice.

### Microalbuminuria as a target to improve cardiovascular and renal outcomes [^ce4f4af9]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Albuminuria is a cardiovascular and renal risk factor in patients with diabetes, patients with hypertension, and the general population. Risk has been shown to increase continuously with increasing urinary albumin levels, starting at levels that once were considered normal. This association is maintained even after adjusting for numerous other factors. Studies also established that a decrease in albuminuria leads to improvement in both cardiovascular and renal outcomes. These data suggest that urinary albumin should be measured routinely and treated to afford cardiovascular and renoprotection.

### KDOQI clinical practice guidelines and clinical practice recommendations for diabetes and chronic kidney disease [^ca6116b0]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2007). Medium credibility.

Limitations of early detection of microalbuminuria are highlighted: no data are available to confirm that detection of microalbuminuria and initiation of treatment at this early stage of DKD leads to a decrease in hard end points (GFR decrease, CKD stage 5, and mortality), and the predictive value of microalbuminuria for DKD is not as high as originally considered.

### Microalbuminuria and mortality in long-duration type 1 diabetes [^7bc389c0]. Diabetes Care (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

Microalbuminuria is a recognized risk factor for increased mortality and renal failure in type 1 diabetes. Whether it remains a powerful predictor in patients with a long duration of type 1 diabetes is not known. We ascertained the prognostic significance of abnormal urinary albumin excretion in a cohort of patients with at least 30 years of type 1 diabetes.

Research Design and Methods

A total of 190 patients with a disease duration of type 1 diabetes of at least 30 years with baseline and 5 years of follow-up.

Results

At baseline 66% were normoalbuminuric, and at 5 years 11% of this cohort had died. Of the 22% who were microalbuminuric at baseline, 26% had died, and of the 8% with persistent proteinuria at baseline, 44% had died. Of the 4% with end-stage renal failure at baseline, 71% had died within 5 years. Death was attributable to a cardiovascular cause in two-thirds of the cases in all groups.

Conclusions

Even in those with a long duration of type 1 diabetes, the presence of abnormal urinary excretion remains a powerful predictor of increased mortality.

### Does microalbuminuria predict diabetic nephropathy? [^4f86fbed]. Diabetes Care (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe risk factors associated with microalbuminuria (MA) in subjects with diabetes, investigate the predictive value of MA as a marker of risk for diabetic nephropathy (DN), and define risk factors associated with the development and progression of MA.

Research Design and Methods

We conducted a prospective longitudinal study of 23 diabetic subjects with persistent MA and 209 diabetic subjects without MA who attended diabetes clinics at the University of Michigan Medical Center in 1989 and 1990. Both groups were examined at baseline and after 7 years. At baseline, urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratios were studied in random, first morning, and 24-h urine samples. At follow-up, a 12-h overnight urine sample was collected and analyzed for albumin and creatinine. At baseline, MA was defined by at least two separate urine specimens with albumin-to-creatinine ratios between 30 and 299 microg albumin per milligram of creatinine.

Results

MA regressed in 56% of subjects with baseline MA without systematic application of corrective measures and developed in 16% of subjects without baseline MA. The predictive value positive of MA as a marker of risk for DN was 43%, and the predictive value negative was 77%. In the combined cohort, the incidence and progression of MA were significantly associated with poor glycemic control and duration of diabetes between 10 and 14 years.

Conclusions

MA may not be as sensitive and specific a predictor of DN as previously suggested. Other markers of risk for DN are needed for optimal clinical management.

### Microalbuminuria and hypertension with focus on type 1 and type 2 diabetes [^7a8c5d84]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Microalbuminuria and hypertension with Over the past decade, there has been considerable focus on the concept of microalbuminuria, not only because it predicts renal disease in type 1 and type 2 diabetes, but also because it relates to premature mortality in the diabetic and in the general population. More importantly, intervention at this stage is now possible with the perspective of preserving glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and ameliorating cardiovascular disease and ensuing strong end-points. INITIAL STUDIES: The concept of microalbuminuria was introduced about 20 years ago and since then there has been a multitude of studies and papers on this subject using the original definition, but not always, in the US. Before that time it was suggested, mainly from the US, that diabetic renal disease was an untreatable relentlessly progressive condition.

Genetic Studies

There is an overwhelming number of studies on genetics and diabetes and also covering the genetics of diabetic complications including nephropathy. However, so far the results are extremely disappointing. Patients at risk cannot be identified and genetic analyses are of no value as a guide to treatment. The notion that the development of complications is controlled mainly by a special genetic pattern is increasingly doubtful. In genetic studies, it is rather phenotypic well-accepted risk factors that dominate. STRUCTURAL BASIS OF MICROALBUMINURIA: Patients with microalbuminuria have significant abnormalities in the kidney, including glomeruli. This is quite clear in patients with type 1 diabetes, but is also seen in type 2 diabetes, where on the other hand, other risk factors such as hypertension and dyslipidaemia also seem to be of importance, including loss of autoregulation. Renal biopsies are generally not indicated in the management of diabetic patients. MICROALBUMINURIA AND EARLY MORTALITY: It is quite clear that microalbuminuria predicts early mortality both in type 1 and type 2 diabetes. The association to other risk factors may partly explain this--but this does not account for the whole picture. Endothelial dysfunction as well as inflammatory and arteriosclerotic abnormalities in blood vessels may be a relevant hypothesis that needs to be further explored along with other possibilities. CLINICAL COURSE AND ASSOCIATED ABNORMALITIES: The risk factor for progression in normoalbuminuric patients to microalbuminuria is higher than normal albumin excretion (strongest factor), poor glycaemic control, elevated blood pressure, and to some extent smoking. The clinical course of microalbuminuria is usually progressive, but with the more effective intervention now available we encounter that the so-called natural history (without intervention) is increasingly difficult to study. Microalbuminuria is clearly associated with a number of abnormalities, almost in all organs, but GFR is generally well preserved in spite of more advanced structural lesions. Therefore, microalbuminuria is an important marker for more pronounced diabetic vascular disease in general as well as for nephropathy. Regression to normoalbuminuria only rarely occurs during standard unchanged nonintensive treatment. TREATMENT STRATEGIES: The best possible glycaemic control is important in preventing and ameliorating the course of normo- and micro-albuminuria. Another major treatment strategy, especially in microalbuminuric patients, is antihypertensive treatment including inhibition of the renal angiotensin aldosterone system. Numerous new studies are available, both in type 1 and type 2 diabetes, documenting that not only microalbuminuria but also renal and cardiovascular complications in these patient are also far better controlled by early detection and treatment. Therefore, screening for microalbuminuria should be a strategy in all diabetes management followed by effective intervention as outlined in this paper.

### Developments in albuminuria testing: a key biomarker for detection, prognosis and surveillance of kidney and cardiovascular disease – A practical update for clinicians [^4573468a]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

The term microalbuminuria was introduced in 1981 by Viberti,Parving and Svendsen and colleaguesto describe urinary albumin excretion levels below the detection threshold of standard dipstick tests but predictive of progression to overt proteinuria, particularly in patients with diabetes.Initially defined as a urinary albumin excretion of 20–200 μg/min or 30–300 mg/24 h, it quickly gained recognition as a critical prognostic marker.Although microalbuminuria was widely accepted as a risk marker for kidney and cardiovascular outcomes in patients with or without diabetes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,the term has since been abandoned due to its misleading implication that small or abnormal albumin molecules were being excreted in urine, as well as the potential for misinterpreting microalbuminuria as clinically insignificant.Furthermore, emerging evidence demonstrated that any detectable albuminuria, even within ‘normal’ ranges, is associated with an increased risk of kidney and cardiovascular outcomes, highlighting a continuous relationship between albuminuria levels and adverse outcomes.,,,,,,,,This pattern parallels findings in blood pressure, where even high‐normal levels (a systolic blood pressure between 120 and 130 mHg) are associated with elevated risk.Advances in the understanding of albumin heterogeneity, including the presence of albumin fragments and modified forms in urine, further challenged the validity of the term.Consequently, microalbuminuria has been removed from clinical and laboratory nomenclature and replaced by standardised, more quantitative terms, such as moderately and severely increased albuminuria.

### KDOQI clinical practice guidelines and clinical practice recommendations for diabetes and chronic kidney disease [^3100855e]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2007). Medium credibility.

KDOQI—screening and diagnostic approach to diabetic kidney disease (DKD) emphasizes albuminuria-based detection and limitations of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). DKD refers to kidney disease that is specific to diabetes, and diagnosis is based in part on elevated urinary albumin excretion divided into microalbuminuria and macroalbuminuria; most professional societies concerned with diabetes and kidney disease now advocate screening for microalbuminuria in patients with diabetes. Screening should begin 5 years after diagnosis of type 1 diabetes and at the time of diagnosis of type 2 diabetes; evidence for the usefulness of eGFR alone as a screening test is less secure, and markers of kidney damage are required to detect early stages because eGFR alone can only detect CKD stage 3 or worse. Because coincidence with other nondiabetic CKD is relatively frequent, evaluation of a person with atypical features should, in selected cases, include additional diagnostic testing, and care should be used in determining tests because radiographic contrast may pose greater risks in people with diabetes and CKD than in others.

### Staging of chronic kidney disease: time for a course correction [^39d03ef6]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2008). Low credibility.

Awareness of chronic kidney disease (CKD) has increased in part because of the definitions and treatment guidelines set out by Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI); however, the staging system set forth by these guidelines has led to several problems and unforeseen consequences. Stages 1 and 2 CKD are difficult to determine using the standard Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) estimation of GFR, and their clinical significance in the absence of other risk factors is unclear. Just because microalbuminuria in people without diabetes is a cardiovascular risk factor does not make it kidney disease. Most patients who receive a diagnosis of stage 3 CKD (GFR between 30 and 59 ml/min) are elderly people, and the vast majority of these patients will die before they reach ESRD. The staging system needs to be modified to reflect the severity and complications of CKD. It is suggested that stages 1 and 2 be eliminated and stages 3, 4, and 5, be simply termed moderate impairment, severe impairment, and kidney failure, respectively. In addition, age should be a modifying factor, especially in moderate kidney impairment. These changes would allow identification and treatment of clinically relevant disease and avoidance of what can seem exaggerated prevalence estimates.

### Isolated microalbuminuria indicates a poor medical prognosis [^93322c07]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Microalbuminuria is often regarded as a sign of end-organ damage due to diabetes and/or hypertension, and as such to be associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular events. It has been questioned whether isolated microalbuminuria, that is microalbuminuria in the absence of a cardiovascular disease (CVD) history, hypertension and diabetes has clinical relevance.

Methods

Included were 8356 subjects who participated in the first four screening rounds of the PREVEND study, a prospective, community-based, observational cohort study. Isolated microalbuminuria was defined as microalbuminuria (30-300 mg/24 h), in the absence of a CVD history, hypertension (blood pressure<140/90 mmHg, not using blood pressure-lowering drugs) and diabetes (fasting glucose<7.0 mmol/L, not using glucose-lowering drugs).

Results

Three hundred subjects met the definition of isolated microalbuminuria, in which 2250 person-years of follow-up were available. In subjects with isolated microalbuminuria, the incidence rates of cardiovascular events and mortality, hypertension and diabetes were 15.3, 28.9 and 8.9 per 1000 person-year follow-up, respectively. Subjects with isolated microalbuminuria had an increased risk for cardiovascular events and mortality [crude HR 2.23 (1.63-3.07); P<0.001], hypertension [OR 1.95 (1.47-2.59); P<0.001] and diabetes [OR 4.69 (2.92-7.51); P<0.001] compared with subjects without microalbuminuria, CVD history, hypertension and/or diabetes. This increased risk remained significant after adjustment for age and gender. The relative risk held by isolated microalbuminuria was similar to the relative risk held by microalbuminuria in subjects that did have a CVD history, hypertension and/or diabetes.

Conclusions

Isolated microalbuminuria indicates a poor prognosis and warrants medical attention.

### Microalbuminuria as a risk predictor in diabetes: the continuing saga [^b8674cd7]. Diabetes Care (2014). Low credibility.

OBJECTIVE The rationale for this study was to review the data on microalbuminuria (MA), an amount of albumin in the urine of 30-299 mg/day, in patients with diabetes in the context of cardiovascular risk and development of kidney disease. The objective was to review the pathophysiology of MA in patients with diabetes and review the data from trials regarding MA in the context of risk for cardiovascular events or kidney disease progression. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Data sources were all PubMed-referenced articles in English-language peer-reviewed journals since 1964. Studies selected had to have a minimum 1-year follow-up and be either a randomized trial linking MA to cardiovascular or kidney disease outcome, a meta-analysis/systematic review, or a large observational cohort study. RESULTS The data suggest that MA is a risk marker for cardiovascular events and possibly for kidney disease development. Its presence alone, however, does not indicate established kidney disease, especially if the estimated glomerular filtration rate is >60 mL/min/1.73 m(2). An increase in MA, when blood pressure and other risk factors are controlled, portends a poor prognosis for kidney outcomes over time. Early in the course of diabetes, aggressive risk factor management focused on glycemic and blood pressure goals is important to delay kidney disease development and reduce cardiovascular risk. CONCLUSIONS MA is a marker of cardiovascular disease risk and should be monitored per guidelines once or twice a year for progression to macroalbuminuria and kidney disease development, especially if plasma glucose, lipids, and blood pressure are at guideline goals.

Guideline 1: Screening and diagnosis of diabetic kidney disease (DKD)—patients with diabetes should be screened annually for DKD, with initial screening commencing 5 years after the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes or from diagnosis of type 2 diabetes; screening should include measurement of urinary albumin-creatinine ratio (ACR) in a spot urine sample and measurement of serum creatinine with estimation of glomerular filtration rate (GFR). In the absence of urinary tract infection, an elevated ACR should be confirmed with 2 additional first-void specimens collected over the next 3 to 6 months, and to confirm classification 2 of 3 samples should fall within the microalbuminuric or macroalbuminuric range. Microalbuminuria is defined as an ACR between 30-300 mg/g, and macroalbuminuria is defined as an ACR > 300 mg/g.

Diabetes and chronic kidney disease with microalbuminuria—In hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes and a GFR greater than 70 mL/min/1.73 m2, studies demonstrated equivalent efficacy of the 2 agents in slowing loss of kidney function, and follow-up in most studies of microalbuminuric patients generally was in the range of 2 to 4 years. Because no trials of ACE inhibitors or ARBs in patients with diabetes and microalbuminuria have demonstrated a reduction in such clinical outcomes as CKD stage 5, doubling of serum creatinine level, or death, the Work Group concluded that evidence for treatment of microalbuminuric patients with these medicines is moderate, representing a change in level of evidence grading from “strong” in the NKF-KDOQI CPGs on Hypertension and Antihypertensive Agents in CKD; in the absence of participation in such a clinical trial, the Work Group recommends this treatment despite moderate evidence.

### Reduction in microalbuminuria as an integrated indicator for renal and cardiovascular risk reduction in patients with type 2 diabetes [^1a3691ef]. Diabetes (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

Microalbuminuria in diabetic patients is a predictor for diabetic nephropathy and cardiovascular disease. The aim of this study is to investigate the clinical impact of reducing microalbuminuria in type 2 diabetic patients in an observational follow-up study.

Research Design and Methods

We enrolled 216 type 2 diabetic patients with microalbuminuria during an initial 2-year evaluation period and observed them for the next 8 years. Remission and a 50% reduction of microalbuminuria were defined as a shift to normoalbuminuria and a reduction <50% from the initial level of microalbuminuria. The association between reducing microalbuminuria and first occurrence of a renal or cardiovascular event and annual decline rate of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was evaluated.

Results

Twelve events occurred in 93 patients who attained a 50% reduction of microalbuminuria during the follow-up versus 35 events in 123 patients without a 50% reduction. The cumulative incidence rate of events was significantly lower in patients with a 50% reduction. A pooled logistic regression analysis revealed that the adjusted risk for events in subjects after a 50% reduction was 0.41 (95% CI 0.15-0.96). In addition, the annual decline rate of eGFR in patients with a 50% reduction was significantly slower than in those without such a reduction. The same results were also found in the analysis regarding whether remission occurred.

Conclusions

The present study provides clinical evidence implying that a reduction of microalbuminuria in type 2 diabetic patients is an integrated indicator for renal and cardiovascular risk reduction.

### Microalbuminuria in nondiabetic adults (...) [^e36adb8b]. JAMA Network (1998). Excellent credibility.

Conclusion Major cardiovascular risk factors are independent correlates of microalbuminuria in nondiabetic middle-aged adults. From this cohort, 110 individuals were excluded for previous diagnosis of diabetes mellitus or fasting plasma glucose levels of at least 7. 8 mmol/L; 7 more individuals, for macroalbuminuria in timed overnight urine collection. Thus, the cohort for our study is 1567 individuals. In univariate logistic analyses, SBP, DBP, and levels of plasma total and non-HDL cholesterol significantly and directly related to microalbuminuria defined as albumin excretion of at least 20 µg/min or at least 25 µg/dL GFR for both sexes; for SBP and DBP, findings were similar when individuals receiving antihypertensive drugs were excluded from analyses.

In models with use of albumin excretion per deciliter of GFR, coefficients were significant in both sexes for SBP and plasma total cholesterol levels and for creatinine clearance; they were significant for men but not women for BMI and cigarettes smoked per day. Findings were similar from analyses with logarithm-transformed albumin excretion and from analyses with exclusion of 48 persons with plasma glucose levels of 6. 4 to
7. 7 mmol/L. In sex-controlled analyses for men and women combined, with DBP instead of SBP, DBP related to albumin excretion per minute and per deciliter of GFR; findings for other variables were similar to the foregoing. Results were similar in analyses with exclusion of individuals with plasma glucose levels of 6. 4 to

Guidelines for diabetes and CKD—Likelihood of diabetic kidney disease (DKD) by glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and albuminuria is stratified as follows: for GFR >60 mL/min (CKD stage 1 + 2), normoalbuminuria is labeled “At risk,” microalbuminuria “Possible DKD,” and macroalbuminuria “DKD”; for GFR 30-60 mL/min (stage 3), normoalbuminuria “Unlikely DKD,” microalbuminuria “Possible DKD,” and macroalbuminuria “DKD”; for GFR <30 mL/min (stage 4 + 5), normoalbuminuria “Unlikely DKD,” microalbuminuria “DKD,” and macroalbuminuria “DKD.” Staging caveats note that “RAS blockade could render microalbuminuric patients normoalbuminuric and macroalbuminuric patients microalbuminuric,” and in early diabetes “GFR less than 90 mL/min may represent a significant loss of function.”

### Is it time to measure microalbuminuria in hypertension? [^c57922de]. Journal of Hypertension (2003). Low credibility.

Former guidelines on hypertension never made a commitment to the detection of microalbuminuria for screening or follow-up of hypertensive patients. On the other hand, growing evidence support the contributory role of microalbuminuria in the prediction of absolute cardiovascular risk in hypertension and document the potential relevance of this parameter to the initial choice of antihypertensive treatment. Upcoming new guidelines and diagnostic algorithms in hypertension need to underscore the clinical positioning of microalbuminuria for stratification of risk and follow-up purposes.

Screening and diagnosis of diabetic kidney disease—ACR should be measured in first-void urine samples, but if a random urine specimen is abnormal, the second test could be done in a first-voided morning sample obtained within the subsequent 3 to 6 months. Screening for microalbuminuria in patients with type 2 diabetes, if leading to multifactorial interventions, can result in reduced risks of cardiovascular events, progression of albuminuria, and development or progression of retinopathy and neuropathy, whereas similar studies in patients with type 1 diabetes are lacking. International control between laboratories should be established, and there should also be standardized reporting of ACRs with internationally agreed-upon categorical definitions.

### Microalbuminuria and cardiovascular risk [^a2549d8f]. American Journal of Hypertension (2004). Low credibility.

Microalbuminuria is a marker for generalized vascular dysfunction. Its prevalence in United States and European general population surveys ranges from 6% to 10%. Increased risk for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality begins with albumin excretion rates that are well within normal limits. Although microalbuminuria interacts with the traditional cardiovascular risk factors, it has an independent relationship to renal and cardiovascular outcomes. For example, microalbuminuria doubles the risk for a cardiovascular event in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus even after adjusting for the usual risk factors. Elevated rates of urinary albumin excretion predict target organ damage, notably renal disease, but are also related to left ventricular dysfunction, stroke, and myocardial infarction. Screening for microalbuminuria, which is recommended by several expert committees and associations, has become a readily accessible procedure. Screening can give clinicians prognostic information concerning cardiovascular risk and assist in guiding therapy. The goal of treatment is to prevent progression of, and even to reverse, microalbuminuria. Abundant evidence demonstrates that antihypertensive therapy is an important key to the control of urinary albumin excretion, and blockade of the renin-angiotensin system (with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers) is the treatment of choice. These drugs have successfully halted or delayed the progression to nephropathy and have reversed elevated rates of albumin excretion to normal values, even when blood pressure reduction has been minimal.

### KDOQI clinical practice guidelines and clinical practice recommendations for diabetes and chronic kidney disease [^3f18b2d3]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2007). Medium credibility.

KDOQI—screening and diagnosis of diabetic kidney disease (DKD) in diabetes— Most professional societies concerned with diabetes and kidney disease now advocate screening for microalbuminuria in patients with diabetes, and screening should begin after 5 years of type 1 diabetes and at the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes because of the inability to establish the onset of type 2 diabetes with certainty. Because urinary albumin excretion has an intraindividual coefficient of variation (CV) of approximately 40%, multiple positive test results are required for classification. Evidence for the usefulness of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) alone as a screening test for CKD in patients with diabetes is less secure; many patients may have elevated or high-normal GFRs early after diagnosis, so markers of kidney damage are required to detect early stages of CKD, and eGFR alone can only detect CKD stage 3 or worse.

KDOQI clinical practice recommendation 1—Management of albuminuria in normotensive patients with diabetes states that normotensive people with diabetes and macroalbuminuria should be treated with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) (C), and that treatment with an ACE inhibitor or an ARB may be considered in normotensive people with diabetes and microalbuminuria (C); it also notes that albuminuria reduction may be considered a treatment target in diabetic kidney disease (DKD) (C). The rationale further specifies that normotensive people with diabetes and macroalbuminuria should receive an ACE inhibitor or an ARB (Moderate/Weak), and that treatments lowering urinary albumin excretion may slow progression of DKD and improve clinical outcomes, even without hypertension.

### Measurable urinary albumin predicts cardiovascular risk among normoalbuminuric patients with type 2 diabetes [^4e9fb195]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

Micro- or macroalbuminuria is associated with increased cardiovascular risk factors among patients with type 2 diabetes, but whether albuminuria within the normal range predicts long-term cardiovascular risk is unknown. We evaluated the relationships between albuminuria and cardiovascular events in 1208 hypertensive, normoalbuminuric patients with type 2 diabetes from the BErgamo NEphrologic Diabetes Complication Trial (BENEDICT), all of whom received angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) therapy at the end of the trial and were followed for a median of 9.2 years. The main outcome was time to the first of fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction; stroke; coronary, carotid, or peripheral artery revascularization; or hospitalization for heart failure. Overall, 189 (15.6%) of the patients experienced a main outcome event (2.14 events/100 patient-years); 24 events were fatal. Albuminuria independently predicted events (hazard ratio [HR], 1.05; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02-1.08). Second-degree polynomial multivariable analysis showed a continuous nonlinear relationship between albuminuria and events without thresholds. Considering the entire study population, even albuminuria at 1-2 μg/min was significantly associated with increased risk compared with albuminuria <1 μg/min (HR, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.02-1.07). This relationship was similar in the subgroup originally randomly assigned to non-ACEI therapy. Among those originally receiving ACEI therapy, however, the event rate was uniformly low and was not significantly associated with albuminuria. Taken together, among normoalbuminuric patients with type 2 diabetes, any degree of measurable albuminuria bears significant cardiovascular risk. The association with risk is continuous but is lost with early ACEI therapy.

### KDOQI clinical practice guidelines and clinical practice recommendations for diabetes and chronic kidney disease [^3a2e99f6]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2007). Medium credibility.

KDOQI—diabetic kidney disease (DKD) terminology and clinical characterization— For consistency with chronic kidney disease (CKD) classification, the term DKD is proposed for a presumptive diagnosis of kidney disease caused by diabetes, and the term “diabetic nephropathy” should be replaced by DKD; the term diabetic glomerulopathy should be reserved for biopsy-proven kidney disease caused by diabetes. DKD is now defined, in part, by increased urinary albumin excretion and is divided into microalbuminuria, a modest elevation associated with stable kidney function but a greater risk of macroalbuminuria and kidney failure, and macroalbuminuria, a higher elevation associated with progressive decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR), increased systemic blood pressure, and a high risk of kidney failure. These generalizations do not apply in all cases because people with normal urinary albumin excretion may have advanced DKD, whereas those with microalbuminuria may have either substantial or no pathological evidence of kidney damage; because diabetes is highly prevalent, some individuals with diabetes may have other types of CKD, although in most cases, clinical measures may be used to diagnose DKD.

### Diabetic nephropathy: common questions [^c7c8455c]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Diabetic nephropathy, or diabetic kidney disease, affects 20 to 30 percent of patients with diabetes. It is a common cause of kidney failure. Diabetic nephropathy presents in its earliest stage with low levels of albumin (microalbuminuria) in the urine. The most practical method of screening for microalbuminuria is to assess the albumin-to-creatinine ratio with a spot urine test. Results of two of three tests for microalbuminuria should be more than 30 mg per day or 20 mcg per minute in a three- to six-month period to diagnose a patient with diabetic nephropathy. Slowing the progression of diabetic nephropathy can be achieved by optimizing blood pressure (130/80 mm Hg or less) and glycemic control, and by prescribing an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker. Patients with diabetes and isolated microalbuminuria or hypertension benefit from angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers. In the event that these medications cannot be prescribed, a nondihydropyridine calcium channel blocker may be considered. Serum creatinine and potassium levels should be monitored carefully for patients receiving angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers. These medications should be stopped if hyperkalemia is pronounced.

### More impact of microalbuminuria on retinopathy than moderately reduced GFR among type 2 diabetic patients [^7740be81]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

Increased urinary albumin excretion and reduced GFR both have been demonstrated to be an independent risk for progressive kidney failure, cardiovascular events, and mortality in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) (–). These findings are also consistent in patients with diabetic nephropathy. Therefore, it is pivotal to combine eGFR and albuminuria for more precise assessment of the clinical outcomes. Recently, the American Diabetes Association recommended that in addition to level of eGFR, the presence of abnormal urine albumin excretion may be useful in the staging of diabetic nephropathy. Previous data have shown the increased risks for renal and cardiovascular outcomes and mortality in patients with albuminuria and stage 1 or 2 CKD than in those with stage 3 CKD without proteinuria, although not all the studies have compared statistical significance. Our study compared the clinical outcomes among these two groups of patients directly. The results showed that patients with microalbuminuria and eGFR ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 have a tendency to increased risks for progressive loss of renal function, cardiovascular events, and all-cause mortality compared with those with moderate renal impairment and normoalbuminuria. Although statistical significance was not reached, the trend corroborates the previous findings.

Some limitations in the current study should be acknowledged. The overall sample size became rather small when we stratified these patients into four groups. The numbers of renal events were low because most subjects were in the early stage of diabetic nephropathy. For patients with early diabetic nephropathy, it may take more follow-up time for the events to occur. However, as our study had a longer observation period for the study end points, this may compensate for these two shortcomings.

In summary, our data show that microalbuminuria is a more useful biomarker than moderately decreased eGFR in predicting retinal outcome of type 2 diabetic patients. Patients with microalbuminuria have a higher risk of the development and progression of diabetic retinopathy even when eGFR is still >60 mL/min/1.73 m 2. Accordingly, we emphasize the importance of regular follow-up of UACR besides eGFR in type 2 diabetic patients, and changes in UACR and eGFR should also be identified during follow-up. Once microalbuminuria occurs, diabetic retinopathy should be more aggressively assessed in these patients even if eGFR is >60 mL/min/1.73 m 2.

### KDOQI clinical practice guidelines and clinical practice recommendations for diabetes and chronic kidney disease [^7966af6c]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2007). Medium credibility.

Diabetes, CKD, and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk highlight that diabetes is one of the most important risk factors for CVD and has been viewed as a CVD equivalent because the likelihood of future events may approach that of people without diabetes who have already had a myocardial infarction, leading to recommendations from both the ADA and the American Heart Association (AHA) for intensive risk reduction in patients with diabetes. The NKF and the AHA recommend that people with CKD be considered in the highest risk category for CVD, and for those with both diabetes and CKD the outlook is far worse than for either condition alone because the combination is one of the most powerful predictors of major adverse cardiovascular events and death. The relationship between CKD severity and risk is continuous; people with diabetes and microalbuminuria have twice the CVD risk of those with normoalbuminuria, and as albuminuria increases and GFR decreases, CVD risk increases progressively. In the UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS), rates of death and progression to macroalbuminuria were equal at the microalbuminuric stage, but at the macroalbuminuric stage the death rate outpaced the rate of kidney disease progression, and more people who reach CKD stage 3 will die, primarily of CVD, than progress to kidney failure, especially if they also have diabetes.

### KDOQI clinical practice guidelines and clinical practice recommendations for diabetes and chronic kidney disease [^d62e939f]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2007). Medium credibility.

Management of albuminuria in normotensive patients with diabetes—implementation issues state that in normotensive people with diabetes and albuminuria the target dose of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) is unknown, and in the absence of side effects or adverse events the Work Group recommends titration up to the maximum approved dose. Placing people with microalbuminuria and diabetes on therapy with an ACE inhibitor or ARB may lead to less attention to glycemic control, and the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999 to 2000 demonstrated that glycemic control has worsened in patients with diabetes and microalbuminuria, which may be caused by health care providers believing that renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibition will reduce albuminuria and thus protect patients from clinical end points; the Work Group emphasizes the importance of glycemic control to prevent and treat albuminuria, as well as to reduce the overall risks of diabetes. Given uncertainty about kidney disease and clinical end points in microalbuminuria, the Work Group’s recommendations for use of ACE inhibitors and ARBs in normotensive people with diabetes and microalbuminuria are less strong than in those with macroalbuminuria.

### Normoalbuminuric renal-insufficient diabetic patients: a lower-risk group [^b349d4bd]. Diabetes Care (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

About 20% of diabetic patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) detected from the new American Diabetes Association recommendations (albumin excretion rate >30 mg/24 h or estimated glomerular filtration rate [GFR] <60 ml/min per 1.73 m2) may be normoalbuminuric. Do the characteristics and outcome differ for subjects with and without albuminuria?

Research Design and Methods

A total of 89 patients with diabetes and a modification of diet in renal disease (MDRD) estimated GFR (e-GFR) <60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 underwent a 51Cr-EDTA B-isotopic GFR determination and were followed up for 38 +/- 11 months.

Results

The mean MDRD e-GFR (41.3 +/- 13.1 ml/min per 1.73 m2) did not significantly differ from the i-GFR (45.6 +/- 29.7). Of the subjects, 15 (17%) were normoalbuminuric. Their i-GFR did not differ from the albuminuric rate and from their MDRD e-GFR, although their serum creatinine was lower (122 +/- 27 vs. 160 +/- 71 micromol/l, P < 0.05): 71% would not have been detected by measuring serum creatinine (sCr) alone. They were less affected by diabetic retinopathy, and their HDL cholesterol and hemoglobin were higher (P < 0.05 vs. albuminuric). None of the CKD normoalbuminuric subjects started dialysis (microalbuminuric: 2/36, macroalbuminuric: 10/38) or died (microalbuminuric: 3/36, macroalbuminuric: 7/38) during the follow-up period (log-rank test: P < 0.005 for death or dialysis), and their albumin excretion rate and sCr values were stable after 38 months, whereas the AER increased in the microalbuminuric patients (P < 0.05), and the sCr increased in the macroalbuminuric patients (P < 0.01).

Conclusions

Although their sCr is usually normal, most of the normoalbuminuric diabetic subjects with CKD according to an MDRD e-GFR below 60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 do really have a GFR below 60 ml/min per 1.73 m2. However, as expected, because of normoalbuminuria and other favorable characteristics, their risk for CKD progression or death is lower.

### Reduced GFR and microalbuminuria are independently associated with prevalent cardiovascular disease in type 2 diabetes: JDDM study 16 [^cb6395e6]. Diabetic Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Aims

We investigated whether a reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevalence, independent of the effect of microalbuminuria in patients with diabetes.

Methods

In a multicentre, large-scale cohort including 3002 Japanese patients with Type 2 diabetes without macroalbuminuria, the relationship of a reduced eGFR and microalbuminuria with CVD was investigated.

Results

Of those patients, 4.8% had a reduced eGFR and microalbuminuria, 12.7% had a reduced eGFR without microalbuminuria and 18.7% had microalbuminuria but normal eGFR. A reduced eGFR and microalbuminuria were each associated with a doubling of the prevalence of CVD. Compared with patients with no microalbuminuria/normal eGFR [odds ratio (OR) 1.0], the OR for CVD was significantly higher in those with a reduced eGFR without microalbuminuria (OR 1.97) and similarly higher in those with microalbuminuria without a reduced eGFR (OR 1.85). The OR was highest in those with both a reduced eGFR and microalbuminuria (OR 3.97, 95% confidence interval 2.55-6.20). The OR for CVD remained significant after adjustments for age, sex, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, smoking, body mass index, glycated haemoglobin and the duration of diabetes, and remained significant if the cut-off point for microalbuminuria was set at the median albumin : creatinine ratio (13.7 mg/g creatinine). In patients without microalbuminuria, a reduced eGFR was associated with CVD only in the older and male groups.

Conclusion

A reduced eGFR and the presence of microalbuminuria were each associated with a near doubling of the prevalence of CVD, independently of traditional CVD risk factors and glycaemic control in patients with Type 2 diabetes.

### Microalbuminuria as a risk factor: the influence of renin-angiotensin system blockade [^7e48d34f]. Journal of Hypertension (2010). Low credibility.

Microalbuminuria, the increase in urinary albumin excretion, has most often been linked with renal disease in diabetic patients. However, accumulating data demonstrate a link between albuminuria and cardiovascular disease in both diabetic and nondiabetic patients, even at very low levels of urinary albumin excretion once considered to be 'normal'. The reasons for the increase in cardiovascular risk may be linked to generalized vascular and endothelial dysfunction, mediated by the renin-angiotensin system and the angiotensin II type 1 receptor. Accordingly, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers have demonstrated some success in treating microalbuminuria. With the prevalence of microalbuminuria at around 7% in the general population, and as high as 39% in diabetic patients, reducing and preventing microalbuminuria is becoming of increasing interest in helping to reduce cardiovascular risk. Subsequently, international guidelines have recommended screening for the presence of microalbuminuria in all patients with hypertension, diabetes or both.

### Low-dose ramipril reduces microalbuminuria in type 1 diabetic patients without hypertension: results of a randomized controlled trial [^cf8575c1]. Diabetes Care (2000). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess if low (1.25 mg) and/or standard (5 mg) doses of the ACE inhibitor ramipril could prevent progression of microalbuminuria (incipient diabetic nephropathy) in normotensive type 1 diabetic patients.

Research Design and Methods

This study, using a multicenter randomized placebo-controlled double-blind parallel group, was conducted over 2 years in 28 outpatient diabetic clinics in the U.K. and Ireland. We screened 334 type 1 diabetic patients with suspected microalbuminuria and normal blood pressure; of these, 140 patients 18-65 years of age with a diagnosis of type 1 diabetes and persistent microalbuminuria, defined as urinary albumin excretion rate (AER) of 20-200 microg/min, were enrolled in the study.

Results

The proportion of patients progressing to macroalbuminuria was reduced in the ramipril groups but did not reach statistical significance over 2 years. AER was significantly lower at year 2 in the combined ramipril-treated patients versus placebo (P = 0.013). More patients on ramipril regressed to normoalbuminuria (<20 microg/min), with 11% for 1.25 mg ramipril, 20% for 5 mg ramipril, and 4% for placebo (P = 0.053). Blood pressure was significantly reduced to a similar extent with both 1.25 and 5 mg ramipril. Supine systolic blood pressure increased from 130 to 134 mmHg in the placebo group and fell in the 1.25 mg ramipril group (from 132 to 129 mmHg) and in the 5 mg ramipril group (from 134 to 130 mmHg) (P = 0.003, compared with placebo). No statistically significant changes were observed in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) between the placebo- and ramipril-treated groups during the 2-year period.

Conclusions

Microalbuminuria is reduced significantly by ramipril treatment in type 1 diabetic patients without hypertension. Although the magnitude of the response was greater, there is no significant difference between responses to 1.25 or 5 mg ramipril. Small but highly significant reductions in systolic and mean arterial pressures occur in ramipril-treated patients. GFR is stable at this stage of the evolution of diabetic nephropathy and is unaffected by ramipril treatment for 2 years.

INTRODUCTION

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is often asymptomatic except in its advanced stages and requires laboratory testing both for diagnosis and prognostic assessment. The absence of clinical manifestations in early stages leads to delays in diagnosis and initiation of appropriate therapies that could slow progression towards kidney failure or other complications. Earlier detection of CKD through appropriate screening and institution of evidence-based interventions has the potential to prevent further kidney damage and progressive loss of kidney function. –

Albuminuria, an early biomarker of CKD and cardiovascular disease, often precedes the loss of kidney function as assessed by declining glomerular filtration rate (GFR).One of the first studies to demonstrate this relationship was the PREVEND study (Prevention of Renal and Vascular End Stage Disease Intervention Trial; 1998 – 2003) which showed in a prospective cohort of approximately 250 subjects that elevated urinary albumin excretion at baseline was independently predictive of developing an impaired GFR. Since then, larger studies from around the world have supported the prognostic value of albuminuria throughout the progression of chronic kidney disease to kidney failure, cardiovascular events, and mortality. These studies have fueled interest in understanding the value of testing for albuminuria in screening for CKD. –

Screening for albuminuria has been extensively studied in diabetic populations and well-established guidelines have aided in earlier detection and treatment of CKD in individuals with diabetes. In those without diabetes, recommendations vary. For non-diabetic patients with hypertension, the 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association “recommends” routine urine dipstick testing, while the 2018 European Society of Cardiology/European Society of Hypertension “recommends” urine albumin to creatinine ratio (ACR) testing for all patients with hypertension as well as annual ACR testing in patients with CKD. For patients without hypertension or diabetes, the United States Preventive Services Task Force concluded that there was insufficient evidence to assess the benefits and risks of screening for CKD. Similarly, the American College of Physicians (ACP) published a weak recommendation given the low-quality of evidence and recommended against screening for CKD without risk factors for CKD.

Given that screening the entire population would be expensive and yield modest returns, we sought to create an optimized risk model that would predict the likelihood of albuminuria among patients without diabetes. Ultimately, the goal of such a risk model would be to serve as a clinical decision tool to help clinicians determine whether to screen a given non-diabetic patient for albuminuria. Widespread implementation of this tool could facilitate more selective testing of individuals at high risk of albuminuria to improve detection of albuminuria and as a result CKD, in this population.

### Diabetes, cardiovascular disease and the microcirculation [^17af0893]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2018). Low credibility.

Microalbuminuria: from epidemiology to clinical practice and back again

Clifford Wilson and Paul Kimmelstiel for the first time in 1936, described UAER as a feature of glomerulosclerosis with poor prognosis. Since then, the role of UAER has evolved from a marker of renal microcirculation to a predictor of a host of circulatory defects. Several epidemiological studies reported elevated UAER as a predictor of future CV events and mortality in diabetes, renal failure, hypertension and the general population. UAER also predicts survival after myocardial infarction and stroke. Therefore, UAER or its biochemical equivalent, albumin:creatinine ratio (ACR), has been widely used as a surrogate marker for assessing microcirculatory target organ damage in patients with T2DM. However, the minimum threshold level of albuminuria as a prognostic indicator of microcirculatory defects is still debated, since an association has also been observed even below the physiological levels that can be measured using commercial kits. A link between albuminuria levels and increased risk of microcirculatory defects/CVD events (odds ratio [OR] 1.20, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.08–1.33) was reported at values ≥ 10.5 mg/24 h in patients with T2DM.

Increased haemodynamic stress and vascular permeability to macromolecules in diabetes can lead to adverse CV events. However, in the absence of a clear mechanistic pathway linking microalbuminuria to adverse CV outcomes, many clinicians consider it as a marker of blood pressure exposure. Nevertheless recent mechanistic studies suggest that the systemic microvascular disturbances that account for the association between microalbuminuria and cardiac target organ damage are independent of either acute or long term BP effects.

Microvascular function as an aetiopathogenic step in those with diabetes and CVD

Patients with T2DM alone are at a higher risk of CV events and CV mortality compared with those without diabetes. The presence of T2DM has a similar impact on morbidity and mortality as the history of CV event. Structural microvascular damage precedes the development of CV events in patients with T2DM whereas changes in microvascular function occur before microangiopathy. In patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), microvascular defects develop several years after diagnosis, probably relative to glycaemic control. On the other hand, in women with a history of gestational diabetes and in those at risk of developing T2DM, microvascular defects are manifested from the stage of diagnosis. Therefore, the fact that an increase in microvascular disease (diabetic retinopathy) defines a diagnostic cut-off value for HbA1c indicates the presence of early and progressive pathophysiological defects even prior to the confirmatory diagnosis based on glycaemia.

KDOQI—attribution of chronic kidney disease (CKD) to diabetic kidney disease (DKD) states that in most people with diabetes, CKD should be attributable to DKD when macroalbuminuria or microalbuminuria plus retinopathy are present, and in people with type 1 diabetes when microalbuminuria plus duration of diabetes longer than 10 years are present (Moderate/Strong); it also notes that glomerular filtration rate (GFR) decreases relentlessly at rates greater than 10 mL/min/y in those with poorly controlled hypertension and macroalbuminuria.

KDOQI diabetes and CKD—albuminuria and renin–angiotensin system blockade: In people with either type 1 or type 2 diabetes and microalbuminuria, prevention of DKD progression by treatment with ACE inhibitors or ARBs is well documented. Whether progression of albuminuria is an acceptable surrogate outcome for progression of DKD was considered moderate rather than strong because of insufficient data for outcomes other than albuminuria (ie, decrease in GFR, CKD stage 5, or mortality), and the Work Group concluded that further study of this issue is necessary to resolve the controversy. For those with hypertension and macroalbuminuria, evidence strongly supports use of ACE inhibitors in type 1 diabetes and ARBs in type 2 diabetes to prevent progression of DKD.

### Summary of KDIGO guideline. what do we really know about management of blood pressure in patients with chronic kidney disease? [^5448dc7c]. Kidney International (2013). Low credibility.

The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes Clinical Practice Guideline for management of blood pressure (BP) in chronic kidney disease (CKD) supersedes the 2004 Kidney Disease Quality Outcomes Initiative document on this topic. The new guideline has been designed to assist clinical decision making in patients with CKD who are not receiving dialysis. The recommendations in the guideline acknowledge that no single BP target is optimal for all CKD patients and encourage individualization of treatment depending on age, the severity of albuminuria, and comorbidities. In general, the available evidence indicates that in CKD patients without albuminuria the target BP should be ≤140mmHg systolic and ≤90mmHg diastolic. However, in most patients with an albumin excretion rate of ≥30mg/24h (i.e., those with both micro- and macroalbuminuria), a lower target of ≤130mmHg systolic and ≤80mmHg diastolic is suggested. In achieving BP control, the value of lifestyle changes and the need for multiple pharmacological agents is acknowledged. Use of agents that block the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system is recommended or suggested in all patients with an albumin excretion rate of ≥30mg/24h. Recommendations are almost identical in CKD patients with and without diabetes. Special considerations relevant to children and those of older age and those who have received a kidney transplant are included. Ongoing controversies in BP management in the context of CKD are highlighted along with key areas for future research.

### Development and progression of renal insufficiency with and without albuminuria in adults with type 1 diabetes in the diabetes control and complications trial and the epidemiology of diabetes interventions and complications study [^234917cc]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

Figure 2 B presents the smoothed distribution of the model-estimated patient-specific percent change in eGFR per year (slope) within each current AER category. While subjects had normal AER or microalbuminuria, there was little variation around the respective mean percent change shown in Table 2 (i.e. a narrow range from the highest to lowest values). Conversely, while subjects had macroalbuminuria, the distribution is flattened and skewed to the left with much more variation among subjects, with some subjects having as much as a 20% reduction per year in eGFR.

Although the incidence of change in eGFR or AER was significantly higher in the DCCT conventional than the intensive treatment group, the relationships between AER and eGFR described above in the combined cohort applied to both treatment groups. Tests of the interaction between DCCT treatment group and AER category in these models were not statistically significant (adjusted for two tests per model).

Additional analyses of a single eGFR <60 ml/min/1.73 m 2 showed a similar but less significant trend (see the online appendix).

Risk factors, prevention, and management of DKD

Definition of DKD and screening

DKD is a clinical diagnosis made based on the presence of albuminuria and/or reduced eGFR, in a person with an established diagnosis of Type 1 diabetes (T1D) or T2D. Table 1 outlines the various methods of measuring albuminuria and their normal ranges using the nomenclature recommended by the latest Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) clinical practice guidelines. These refer to normal to mildly increased, moderately increased and severely increased albuminuria to replace normo, micro- and macroalbuminuria, respectively.In clinical practice recommendations by American Diabetes Association (ADA), normal albumin creatinine ratio (ACR) is defined as < 30 mg/g, and high urinary albumin excretion as ⩾ 30 mg/g.

Table 1. 
Various urine albumin collections for defining albuminuria.

The most convenient screening method appears to be a single (preferably early morning) urine sent for ACR, and an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), taken at least annually. If urinary ACR is abnormal, it should be repeated to confirm. Arbitrary cut offs for albuminuria are described, although it is clear that the value is a continuous variable, and may have significant day-to-day differences in an individual person.The presence of mildly elevated ACR, however, does appear to be an early precursor of progression to severely increased albuminuria in many patients, although some may regress to normal albumin excretion due to therapeutic intervention.

A broader term of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in people with diabetes is used to describe people with diabetes who have a reduced eGFR below 60 ml/min/1.73 m 2, irrespective of cause. If albuminuria is not present is such patients, then DKD may be less likely, and alternative diagnoses should be considered.CKD in the absence of albuminuria in an elderly person with diabetes is less likely to progress to ESRD.Other reasons to consider non-diabetic renal disease in people with diabetes and CKD are the absence of retinopathy, rapid deterioration in renal function, active urinary sediment, nephrotic range albuminuria (ACR > 220 mg/mmol), or symptoms/signs of other systemic disease.

### Novel urinary protein biomarkers predicting the development of microalbuminuria and renal function decline in type 1 diabetes [^570c064f]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

Despite tremendous progress in treatment, patients with type 1 diabetes still live 15 years shorter, experience excess morbidity, and have medical costs over 10 times higher than the general population. Modification of traditional risk factors has made only limited impact on development of renal complications in these patients. Improved glycemic control reduces progression to early stages of microvascular complications in type 1 diabetes even years later, but the risk of diabetic nephropathy is not completely abolished by improved glycemic control or lowering blood pressure. Whereas rates of end-stage renal disease have declined over recent years, after 30 years of diabetes duration, the cumulative incidence of end-stage renal disease is 7.8% among patients with type 1 diabetes. Further, the presence of microvascular complications is associated with increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease, which remains the leading cause of death in people with type 1 diabetes.

The development of renal complications and eventual end-stage renal disease in people with diabetes has been thought to follow a linear path involving the development of microalbuminuria, progressing to frank proteinuria. It was thought that renal function only declines once proteinuria is present and that regression of microalbuminuria indicates reversal of the disease progress. However, clinical trials have recently demonstrated that this dogma may be incorrect. First, renal function as measured by glomerular filtration rate (GFR) declines before the development of proteinuria, demonstrating that there is an earlier phase of kidney damage that could be detected and targeted with interventions. Second, kidney damage can progress even when microalbuminuria has regressed. The identification of novel biomarkers for early renal disease is therefore a high priority.

Urine is an easily accessible biological matrix for which to identify new biomarkers. The urinary proteome is very complex, containing 1,000 of proteins and peptides that are derived from filtration/secretion/reabsorption processes within the kidney. Many of these proteins are sensitive to alterations in the kidney, and urinary proteomics provides a platform from which to simultaneously quantify hundreds of urinary proteins.

### Chronic kidney disease and risk management: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^82c59585]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Diagnosis of chronic kidney disease in people with diabetes—clinical features: CKD in people with diabetes is usually a clinical diagnosis made based on the presence of albuminuria and/or reduced eGFR in the absence of signs or symptoms of other primary causes of kidney damage, with typical presentation including long-standing diabetes, retinopathy, albuminuria without gross hematuria, and gradually progressive loss of eGFR. Reduced eGFR without albuminuria has been frequently reported in type 1 and type 2 diabetes and is becoming more common over time.

### Gestational diabetes mellitus alone in the absence of subsequent diabetes is associated with microalbuminuria: results from the kidney early evaluation program (KEEP) [^173e31e9]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

Women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) maintain a higher risk for recurrent GDM and overt diabetes. Overt diabetes is a risk factor for development of chronic kidney disease (CKD), but GDM alone, without subsequent development of overt diabetes, may also pose a risk for CKD.

Research Design and Methods

This cross-sectional analysis included Kidney Early Evaluation Program (KEEP) participants from 2000 to 2009. Patient characteristics and kidney function among three categories (GDM alone, overt diabetes, and no history of diabetes) were compared. The prevalence of microalbuminuria, macroalbuminuria, and CKD stages 1-2 and 3-5 was assessed using logistic regression.

Results

Of 37,716 KEEP female participants, 571 (1.5%) had GDM alone and 12,100 (32.1%) had overt diabetes. Women with GDM had a higher rate of microalbuminuria but not macroalbuminuria than their nondiabetic peers (10.0 vs. 7.7%) that was substantially lower than the 13.6% prevalence in diabetic women. In multivariate analysis, women with GDM alone, compared with nondiabetic women, demonstrated increased odds of CKD stages 1-2 (multivariate odds ratio 1.54 [95% CI 1.16-2.05]) similar to the odds for women with overt diabetes (1.68 [1.55-1.82]). In stratified analyses, age, race, BMI, and hypertension modified the odds for CKD stages 1-2 but not CKD stages 3-5 among women with GDM.

Conclusions

Women with GDM alone have a higher prevalence of microalbuminuria than women without any history of diabetes, translating to higher rates of CKD stages 1-2. These results suggest that GDM, even in the absence of subsequent overt diabetes, may increase the risk for future cardiovascular and kidney disease.

### Effect of oral fluid intake on urinary albumin excretion in diabetes mellitus [^38b8064b]. Journal of Diabetes and Its Complications (2002). Low credibility.

The importance of routine screening for microalbuminuria in patients with diabetes has gained widespread acceptance. Since shortened collection times and random urine sampling facilitate outpatient testing for patients, it is necessary to establish whether a recent fluid intake might alter test results. Specifically, does an oral fluid load (15 ml/kg) effect urinary albumin excretion in Type I diabetes? Indeed, we show that fluid intake had a significant impact: albumin concentration decreased, whereas the albumin/creatinine ratio (A/C) and albumin excretion rate increased (P<.001) significantly.

### Albuminuria, serum creatinine, and estimated glomerular filtration rate as predictors of cardio-renal outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and kidney disease: a systematic literature review [^a23eee34]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Nevertheless, in light of the extant epidemiologic evidence, the clinical importance of albuminuria as a prognosticator of kidney disease has recently been challenged. Although albuminuria is commonly used to assess kidney disease development and progression among patients with T2DM, high variability has been observed in this individual marker along with insufficient sensitivity or specificity to detect kidney disease end points on its own. By extension, the predictive utility of micro-albuminuria has further come into question due to observed spontaneous remission in people with diabetes. On this basis, seeking out novel biomarkers that can more reliably identify individuals at risk of experiencing poor renal outcomes is warranted. Yet to date, most studies have only assessed the relationship of individual, rather than combined or composite biomarkers, with renal outcomes, and no new single biomarker has been shown capable of outperforming albuminuria. Given the numerous pathophysiological processes that encompass DKD (e.g. hyperfiltration, pro-inflammatory, pro-fibrotic, and angiogenic processes), it is doubtful that albuminuria, or any other single biomarker, is individually capable of accurately forecasting the development and progression of renal damage in persons with T2DM. On the other hand, a more comprehensive selection of multiple biomarkers that capture distinct pathways involved in renal impairment would presumably augment risk prediction more effectively than the use of a single biomarker alone. Indeed, extending our efforts in this study beyond the conventional “albuminuric pathway” has been described elsewhere, and provides impetus for others to establish a panel of biomarkers intended to improve early detection of kidney disease development, as well as its progression in diabetes. For effective clinical use, this panel would need to be highly sensitive and specific, minimally invasive to collect, and cost-effective.

### The impact of type 2 diabetes and microalbuminuria on future cardiovascular events in patients with clinically manifest vascular disease from the second manifestations of ARTerial disease (SMART) study [^0c6bbf4b]. Diabetic Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Aims

Type 2 diabetes mellitus and microalbuminuria are important risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Whether these two complications are important and independent risk factors for future CVD events in a high-risk population with clinically manifest vascular disease is unknown. The objectives of this study were to examine the impact of Type 2 diabetes and microalbuminuria on future CVD events.

Methods

Patients with clinically manifest vascular disease (coronary, cerebral and peripheral vascular disease) from the Second Manifestation of Arterial disease study were followed up for 4 years. Data obtained from 1996-2006 were analysed. At baseline, there were 804 patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus (mean age 60 years) and 2983 patients without. Incident CVD (n = 458) was defined as hospital-verified myocardial infarction, stroke, vascular death and the composite of these vascular events.

Results

Both Type 2 diabetes [hazard ratio (HR) 1.42, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.16, 1.75] and microalbuminuria (HR 1.86, 95% CI 1.49, 2.33) increased the risk of new cardiovascular events in univariate analyses. From multivariable models, presence of diabetes remained significantly and independently related to incident CVD (HR 1.42, 95% CI 1.11, 1.80). Presence of microalbuminuria also remained significantly independently related to incident CVD (HR 1.38, 95% CI 1.07, 1.77). In diabetes-stratified analyses, the effect of microalbuminuria on CVD risk was observed only in patients with diabetes. In microalbuminuria-stratified analyses, the significant and independent effect of diabetes on CVD risk was shown only in the non-microalbuminuric group.

Conclusions

In this high-risk population, both microalbuminuria and Type 2 diabetes are important and independent risk factors for future CVD.

### The impact of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors on type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients with and without early diabetic nephropathy [^c526e725]. Kidney International (2012). Low credibility.

Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors prevent the progression of kidney disease in patients with diabetic nephropathy, and we studied how that benefit varies by the type of diabetes and baseline urinary albumin. We pooled data from 49 randomized controlled trials in a meta-analysis using the ratio of endpoint urinary albumin levels in those treated compared to those untreated with renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors in both fixed- and random-effects models. The urinary albumin excretion for treated microalbuminuric patients with Type 1 diabetes was on average 60% lower at the end of the trial compared with patients not treated with renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors using the fixed-effects model and 67% lower using the random-effects model. There was no significant effect of treatment in patients with normal albumin excretion. For normoalbuminuric patients with Type 2 diabetes, urinary albumin excretion was on average 12% lower after treatment using the fixed-effects model compared to 21% lower using the random-effects model. For microalbuminuric patients, urinary albumin excretion was on average 23% lower using the fixed-effects model and 27% lower using the random-effects model. Thus, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibition reduced urinary albumin excretion for Type 1 diabetic patients with micro-, but not those with normoalbuminuria. Treatment reduced urinary albumin excretion for Type 2 diabetic patients with and without microalbuminuria.

### Occurrence of microalbuminuria in young people with type 1 diabetes: importance of age and diabetes duration [^817a4a31]. Diabetic Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Aims

To determine the occurrence of microalbuminuria in young people with Type 1 diabetes mellitus followed prospectively for 2 years and to relate the presence of persistent elevations in urinary albumin excretion (UAE) to age, diabetes duration, puberty and other factors.

Methods

During a 2 year period, random urine samples were obtained from 471 patients, aged 8-18 years (mean +/-sd 12.9 +/- 2.3 years) with Type 1 diabetes duration 5.6 +/- 3.0 years, as part of routine clinical care. Urine albumin and creatinine concentrations were measured in 1310 samples (median, 3 samples per patient) and the albumin:creatinine ratio was calculated (in micrograms albumin per milligram creatinine). Height, weight, blood pressure (BP), glycated haemoglobin (HbA(1c)), blood glucose monitoring frequency and Tanner staging were collected from patients' medical records.

Results

Twenty-three per cent of patients had one or more sample with elevated UAE (> or =20 microg/mg) and 9.3% had persistent elevations (> or =2 samples > or =20 microg/mg). Those with and without persistent microalbuminuria did not differ significantly in age, diabetes duration, z-score for body mass index, pubertal status or BP percentile. Ten per cent of children <13 years old and 9% of children > or =13 years old had persistent microalbuminuria. Persistent microalbuminuria was significantly associated with diabetes duration only in older children (duration 0.5-3 years, 4%; 4-6 years, 8%; > or =7 years, 14%; P = 0.02, trend test). Mean HbA(1c) over the 2 years was 8.7 +/- 1.2%. In a logistic regression model, mean HbA(1c) was the only significant predictor of persistent microalbuminuria (odds ratio 1.3, 95% confidence interval 1.0-1.6, P = 0.05).

Conclusions

Microalbuminuria in older children with Type 1 diabetes is likely to be clinically significant. In younger children, it may reflect functional, reversible renal changes. Longitudinal analysis is needed to confirm the probable transient nature of microalbuminuria in young patients with Type 1 diabetes.

### Microalbuminuria in essential hypertension [^e90ebac7]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2002). Low credibility.

Microalbuminuria (urinary albumin excretion equal to 30-300 mg/24 h) is a reliable indicator of premature cardiovascular mortality in diabetic patients and in the general population. In insulin-dependent and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus microalbuminuria is a marker of initial diabetic nephropathy and predicts the evolution toward renal insufficiency. In essential hypertension the clinical and prognostic role of microalbuminuria is more controversial. While it is a recognised marker of cardiovascular complications and a reliable predictor of ischaemic heart disease, its prognostic value on the risk of progressive renal alterations is still uncertain because no prospective studies, taking microalbuminuria as a selection criterion and renal insufficiency as an end point, are available. Blood pressure control with antihypertensive drugs is accompanied by a reduction in urinary albumin excretion. The favourable effects of antihypertensive agents on microalbuminuria appear to be proportional to blood pressure reduction, but angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin-II-receptor antagonists show an additional beneficial effect on urinary albumin excretion. Whether the reduction of microalbuminuria obtained through pharmacological intervention has favourable prognostic implications remain to be demonstrated. However, screening for microalbuminuria is a relatively easy and inexpensive procedure and reveals a potentially treatable abnormality. Thus, considering that microalbuminuria identifies hypertensive subjects at higher risk than standard, urinary albumin excretion should be routinely measured in hypertensive patients and, in the presence of microalbuminuria, antihypertensive treatment should be intensified in order to obtain an optimal blood pressure control.

### Relationship between diabetic retinopathy, microalbuminuria and overt nephropathy, and twenty-year incidence follow-up of a sample of type 1 diabetic patients [^a16e07b9]. Journal of Diabetes and Its Complications (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose

To determine the incidence and relationship of diabetic retinopathy (DR), microalbuminuria and overt nephropathy (ON).

Method

A 20-year prospective study, in a cohort of 110 consecutive type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM) patients, without diabetic retinopathy or microalbuminuria at enrolment in 1990.

Results

The 20-year incidence of any DR was 70.91%, microalbuminuria 42.72%, and ON was 23.63%. Regarding the risk factors: pre pubertal age at diagnosis was significant for DR and ON, LDL-cholesterol and CT/HDL-cholesterol were significant for DR but not for microalbuminuria or ON. The relationship between DR and ON demonstrated that DR was a significant risk factor for ON, but ON was significant for sight-threatening DR. At the end of the study, two major groups of patients were formed: patients with DR only and patients with DR and ON. For the development of only DR we can assume that the most important risk factor is the duration of DM, followed by the high levels of HbA1c, pre-pubertal age at onset, and arterial hypertension; and for the development of ON and DR simultaneously, risk factors are higher levels of HbA1c, arterial hypertension, DM duration and pre-pubertal age at onset.

Conclusions

In the current study, two major groups of patients have been formed, those who developed only DR and those who developed DR and ON. For the former, incidence increased as DM duration increased, and for the latter incidence appeared to be closely related to levels of HbA1c.

### Standards of medical care in diabetes – 2010 [^8dfb0607]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

Diabetic nephropathy occurs in 20–40% of patients with diabetes and is the single leading cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Persistent albuminuria in the range of 30–299 mg/24 h (microalbuminuria) has been shown to be the earliest stage of diabetic nephropathy in type 1 diabetes and a marker for development of nephropathy in type 2 diabetes. Microalbuminuria is also a well-established marker of increased CVD risk. Patients with microalbuminuria who progress to macroalbuminuria (≥300 mg/24 h) are likely to progress to ESRD. However, a number of interventions have been demonstrated to reduce the risk and slow the progression of renal disease.

Intensive diabetes management with the goal of achieving near-normoglycemia has been shown in large prospective randomized studies to delay the onset of microalbuminuria and the progression of micro- to macroalbuminuria in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. The UKPDS provided strong evidence that control of blood pressure can reduce the development of nephropathy. In addition, large prospective randomized studies in patients with type 1 diabetes have demonstrated that achievement of lower levels of systolic blood pressure (<140 mmHg) resulting from treatment using ACE inhibitors provides a selective benefit over other antihypertensive drug classes in delaying the progression from micro- to macroalbuminuria and can slow the decline in GFR in patients with macroalbuminuria. In type 2 diabetes with hypertension and normoalbuminuria, RAS inhibition has been demonstrated to delay onset of microalbuminuria.

### KDOQI clinical practice guidelines and clinical practice recommendations for diabetes and chronic kidney disease [^b72dc66b]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2007). Medium credibility.

KDOQI diabetes and chronic kidney disease epidemiology and care gaps—global and U.S. burden is highlighted as follows: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is described as a worldwide public health problem affecting more than 50 million people, with more than 1 million receiving kidney replacement therapy, and in the United States CKD affects 11% of the population with those affected at increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and kidney failure. Kidney failure represents about 1% of prevalent CKD in the United States, and the prevalence of kidney failure treated by dialysis or transplantation is projected to increase from 453,000 in 2003 to 651,000 in 2010. Among people with a history of diabetes in the United States, microalbuminuria is found in 43% and macroalbuminuria in 8%, and diabetes accounts for 45% of prevalent kidney failure, up from 18% in 1980. Despite care advances, fewer than 1 in 4 patients with diabetes receives at least 1 hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) test, at least 1 lipid test, and at least 1 glucose testing strip each year.

### Diabetic nephropathy: diagnosis, prevention, and treatment [^95e1dec7]. Diabetes Care (2005). Low credibility.

Diabetic nephropathy is the leading cause of kidney disease in patients starting renal replacement therapy and affects approximately 40% of type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients. It increases the risk of death, mainly from cardiovascular causes, and is defined by increased urinary albumin excretion (UAE) in the absence of other renal diseases. Diabetic nephropathy is categorized into stages: microalbuminuria (UAE >20 microg/min and < or =199 microg/min) and macroalbuminuria (UAE > or =200 microg/min). Hyperglycemia, increased blood pressure levels, and genetic predisposition are the main risk factors for the development of diabetic nephropathy. Elevated serum lipids, smoking habits, and the amount and origin of dietary protein also seem to play a role as risk factors. Screening for microalbuminuria should be performed yearly, starting 5 years after diagnosis in type 1 diabetes or earlier in the presence of puberty or poor metabolic control. In patients with type 2 diabetes, screening should be performed at diagnosis and yearly thereafter. Patients with micro- and macroalbuminuria should undergo an evaluation regarding the presence of comorbid associations, especially retinopathy and macrovascular disease. Achieving the best metabolic control (A1c <7%), treating hypertension (<130/80 mmHg or <125/75 mmHg if proteinuria >1.0 g/24 h and increased serum creatinine), using drugs with blockade effect on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, and treating dyslipidemia (LDL cholesterol <100 mg/dl) are effective strategies for preventing the development of microalbuminuria, in delaying the progression to more advanced stages of nephropathy and in reducing cardiovascular mortality in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes.

Chronic kidney disease stages

*Renal damage is defined by abnormalities in the urine and blood tests, imaging exams or in pathology

GFR = glomerular filtration rate

Serum creatinine concentration should not be used as an isolated index for the evaluation of renal function, since its measure is affected by other factors besides GFR itself, such as tubular secretion, extrarenal generation and protein ingestion.

Special Situations

Patients with micro- or macroalbuminuria, after the confirmation of diagnosis (2 measurements), should undergo a complete evaluation concerning differential diagnosis and assessment of renal function. DN is associated with several other conditions that need to be addressed making the management of these patients very complex. However this is not within the scope of the present manuscript and a detailed approach could be found in a recent review.

Diabetic patients can have other kidney diseases. The differential diagnosis is usually based on the history, physical examination, laboratory evaluation and kidney imaging. Renal biopsy has only been recommended in special situations. In the presence of micro or microalbuminuria and diabetic retinopathy in a patient with long term DM (e.g. >10 years) the assumption that DM is causing the renal disease is generally correct. Conversely, in diabetic patients with type 2 DM with a fast increment in albuminuria and in patients with type 1 DM where macroalbuminuria develop in the absence of diabetic retinopathy a differential diagnosis should be carried out. However, in type 2 diabetic patients the time of DM onset is usually unknown and retinopathy could be absent in a significant proportion (28%) of patients with albuminuria. In summary, absent retinopathy, short duration of DM and faster decline in GFR and/or albuminuria increment are indications to suspect of nondiabetic renal disease. If after a non-invasive evaluation the diagnosis is still unclear, a kidney biopsy should be discussed. In type 2 DM the prevalence of nondiabetic renal disease could vary from 12 to 38%. All the kidney biopsy data are derived from retrospective studies. The differences in the prevalence of non-diabetic lesion observed in the studies probably reflect different criteria used to indicate renal biopsies. In one study, subjects with type 2 DM, gross proteinuria (>1 g) without retinopathy, and hematuria and no retinopathy, 19% of patients with confirmed DN had another glomerulopathy associated. In this study, patients without diabetic glomerulosclerosis had a better prognosis than those with diabetic glomerulosclerosis. Another aspect that needs to be addressed is that it is not clear if there is additional benefit of detecting other nephropathies in the management of these patients.

### Sequence of progression of albuminuria and decreased GFR in persons with type 1 diabetes: a cohort study [^42dfeecd]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Background

The sensitivity of albuminuria in predicting loss of kidney function has been questioned. We determined the sequence of kidney disease stages (microalbuminuria, macroalbuminuria, low estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR], and end-stage renal disease [ESRD]) and characterized those without albuminuria before a low eGFR.

Study Design

The Pittsburgh Epidemiology of Diabetes Complications Study is a prospective cohort investigation of childhood-onset type 1 diabetes.

Setting & Participants

480 study participants with eGFR greater than 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) (mean age, 27 years; diabetes duration, 19 years at study entry) were prospectively followed up for 16 years.

Outcomes & Measurements

Low eGFR was defined as creatinine clearance less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) from timed urine collections; microalbuminuria, as albumin excretion rate between 20 to 200 microg/min (30 to 300 mg/24 h); macroalbuminuria, as albumin excretion rate greater than 200 microg/min (>300 mg/24 h); and ESRD, as dialysis or renal transplantation.

Results

The 33 of 480 individuals (7%) who developed ESRD had prior albuminuria. 71 of 480 (15%) individuals developed low eGFR. 66 of 71 (93%) had prior/concurrent albuminuria, and 5 of 71 (7%) did not. Incident low eGFR values in the 5 patients were: (1) 54, (2) 58, (3) 59, (4) 59.7, and (5) 59.8 mL/min/1.73 m(2). 3 of 5 (60%; patients 1, 4, and 5) subsequently developed albuminuria. Final eGFRs in the 5 patients were: (1) 94, (2) 86, (3) 60, (4) 65, and (5) 54 mL/min/1.73 m(2), respectively.

Limitations

GFR and insulin sensitivity were not measured, but estimated. Incident decreased eGFR in patients without preceding/concurrent albuminuria may be caused by misclassification or a temporary eGFR decrease.

Conclusions

Moderately decreased eGFR may occur rarely in patients with type 1 diabetes without preceding albuminuria.

### Standards of medical care in diabetes – 2009 [^21e5fcb9]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Diabetic nephropathy occurs in 20–40% of patients with diabetes and is the single leading cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Persistent albuminuria in the range of 30–299 mg/24 h (microalbuminuria) has been shown to be the earliest stage of diabetic nephropathy in type 1 diabetes and a marker for development of nephropathy in type 2 diabetes. Microalbuminuria is also a well-established marker of increased CVD risk. Patients with microalbuminuria who progress to macroalbuminuria (300 mg/24 h) are likely to progress to ESRD. However, a number of interventions have been demonstrated to reduce the risk and slow the progression of renal disease.

Intensive diabetes management with the goal of achieving near normoglycemia has been shown in large prospective randomized studies to delay the onset of microalbuminuria and the progression of micro- to macroalbuminuria in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. The UKPDS provided strong evidence that control of blood pressure can reduce the development of nephropathy. In addition, large prospective randomized studies in patients with type 1 diabetes have demonstrated that achievement of lower levels of systolic blood pressure (<140 mmHg) resulting from treatment using ACE inhibitors provides a selective benefit over other antihypertensive drug classes in delaying the progression from micro- to macroalbuminuria and can slow the decline in GFR in patients with macroalbuminuria. In type 2 diabetes with hypertension and normoalbuminuria, ACE inhibition has been demonstrated to delay progression to microalbuminuria.

In addition, ACE inhibitors have been shown to reduce major CVD outcomes (i.e. myocardial infarction, stroke, death) in patients with diabetes, thus further supporting the use of these agents in patients with microalbuminuria, a CVD risk factor. ARBs have also been shown to reduce the rate of progression from micro- to macroalbuminuria as well as ESRD in patients with type 2 diabetes (–). Some evidence suggests that ARBs have a smaller magnitude of rise in potassium compared with ACE inhibitors in people with nephropathy. It is important to note that the benefits of both ACE inhibitors and ARBs in those with diabetic nephropathy are strongly associated with the reduction in albuminuria. Combinations of drugs that block the rennin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (e.g. an ACE inhibitor plus an ARB, a mineralocorticoid antagonist, or a direct renin inhibitor) have been shown to provide additional lowering of albuminuria (–). However, the long-term effects of such combinations on renal or cardiovascular outcomes have not yet been evaluated in clinical trials.

### New strategies to improve clinical outcomes for diabetic kidney disease [^ae28e555]. BMC Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Clinical manifestations

DKD often progresses to kidney failure or leads to cardiovascular events that cause death in about half of those affected. Therefore, early awareness, detection, and intervention are essential to improve clinical outcomes.

Diagnostic tools and laboratory practices for DKD

A persistent elevation in urinary albumin to creatinine ratio (UACR, ≥30mg/g [≥3 mg/mmol]), and/or a persistent reduction in eGFR (<60 mL/min/1.73m 2) in a person with diabetes indicates DKD. To qualify as DKD, however, these lesions must be due only to diabetes-related factors.

The American Diabetes Association (ADA) Standards of Medical Care recommends that people with T2D be screened for DKD at their initial diagnosis and annually thereafter.

As shown in Fig. 3, there are three categories of albuminuria :
Stage A1, normal to mildly increased albuminuria : <30 mg/g (<3 mg/mmol) UACR in urine sample
Stage A2, moderately increased albuminuria, microalbuminuria: 30–300 mg/g (3–30 mg/mmol) UACR; occurring ≥2 times, 3–6 months apart. This low-grade albuminuria is a less effective predictor of disease progression than macroalbuminuria
Stage A3, severely increased albuminuria, macroalbuminuria: >300 mg/g (>30 mg/mmol) UACR; occurring ≥2 times, 3–6 months apart

### Association between remission of macroalbuminuria and preservation of renal function in patients with type 2 diabetes with overt proteinuria [^d7f6e328]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Diabetic nephropathy in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a leading cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) all over the world. The typical progressive course of diabetic nephropathy is initially developing an increase in albuminuria (known as microalbuminuria), progressing to macroalbuminuria, and, thereafter, a rapid decline in renal function. A few decades ago, diabetic nephropathy was considered to be a progressive and irreversible chronic complication. Moreover, the progression of macroalbuminuria was considered the “point of no return.” Thus, the main therapeutic target for T2DM patients with macroalbuminuria was the prevention of the progression to ESRD. Recently, growing evidence has contradicted this point of no return concept. Several clinical studies have reported that intensive intervention including inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system could induce a reduction in macroalbuminuria and improve renal prognosis (–). Thus, reduction of macroalbuminuria could be considered an important therapeutic target to improve renal outcomes in diabetic patients. However, how often remission from macroalbuminuria to microalbuminuria or normoalbuminuria occurs and its effect on the deterioration of renal function of T2DM patients remain unclear. In particular, there is almost no evidence from a primary care setting. Actually, in the clinical practice, we often encounter patients with T2DM that has already been complicated by macroalbuminuria at the time when they first consulted the hospital because they were unaware that they were suffering from diabetes. Moreover, a considerable number of T2DM patients progress to advanced nephropathy because of long-standing poor diabetes control. These patients must be at high risk for the progression to ESRD. However, it remains unclear whether their renal prognosis can be improved by later intensified diabetes treatment in primary care practice.

Thus, the aim of this study was to clarify the clinical characteristics of T2DM patients who showed a reduction in macroalbuminuria in the primary care practice and to estimate the rate of reduction in macroalbuminuria and its effect on renal function. In particular, we focused on T2DM patients with macroalbuminuria who had not been treated for diabetes or had not received adequate intensified diabetes treatment according to clinical recommendations before they first consulted the clinic.

ACEi or ARB

For the previous decades, ACEi and ARBs have been the mainstay of therapy for slowing the progression of proteinuric kidney disease. Numerous trials aggregated in meta-analysis have shown that both ACEi and ARBs reduce eGFR decline and progression to ESKD in both diabetic and non-diabetic proteinuric kidney disease (A3 or uPCR > 650 mg/g, uACR > 300 mg/g). These medications should generally be titrated to their maximally tolerated doses.

Patients with diabetes and moderate albuminuria (A2 or uACR 30-300 mg/g) benefit from maximally tolerated ACEi or ARB given trial data exhibiting decreased development of increasing albuminuria to A3. For non-diabetic patients with moderate albuminuria, less data exists for benefit of ACEi or ARBs, but patients still likely derive benefit from albuminuria reduction with these agents. ACEi and ARBs do not to have the same eGFR preservation in patients with non-proteinuric kidney disease, and thus are not recommended for this subgroup.

SGLT2i

SGLT2is initially started as glucose lowering agents for T2DM but were subsequently shown to have significant cardiovascular and kidney protection in large high quality RCTs. In a meta-analysis, SGLT2is even have kidney protective effects for diabetic patients without albuminuria. Thus, for patients with diabetes and evidence of CKD (eGFR > 20), SGLT2is are strongly recommended after addition of maximally tolerated ACEi or ARB.

For patients with non-diabetic kidney disease, SGLT2is were assessed in two large kidney outcome RCTs, DAPA-CKD and EMPA-KIDNEY. For non-diabetic patients with A3, SGLT2i exhibited similar kidney, cardiovascular, and mortality benefits as previous trials in patients with diabetes. Evidence for those with moderate-to-no albuminuria is limited to modest GFR decline attenuation, though does not appear to have significant benefit on the primary outcomes. Overall, for patients with non-diabetic kidney disease (eGFR > 20) and albuminuria, SGLT2i are also strongly recommended after addition of maximally tolerated ACEi or ARB.

### Association between insulin resistance and development of microalbuminuria in type 2 diabetes: a prospective cohort study [^39881d2d]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Microalbuminuria has long been recognized as an important biomarker to predict micro- and macrovascular complications and mortality for patients with type 2 diabetes. Of many established risk factors linked to the development of microalbuminuria, insulin resistance—one of the fundamental pathogenic features of type 2 diabetes—deserves our special attention. The significant association between insulin resistance and microalbuminuria in type 2 diabetes has frequently been demonstrated across different ethnic populations. In Hong Kong, Chan et al. found that diabetic patients with albuminuria had a higher homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) score than those without albuminuria. In Japan, a case-control study identified the HOMA score as an independent variable for urinary albumin excretion in diabetic patients. In Italy, Parvanova et al. showed a significant association between glucose disposal rate and microalbuminuria, and De Cosmo et al. revealed that diabetic males in the highest quartile of the HOMA were more likely than those in the lowest to be associated with microalbuminuria. In Iran, diabetic patients in the highest quartile of HOMA were also found more likely to have increased urinary albumin excretion. However, to our best knowledge, research designated to depict the relationship between insulin resistance and microalbuminuria has been conducted primarily with a cross-sectional design. None of the aforementioned results have been reconfirmed by a prospective cohort research. The purpose of this study was to explore the effects of insulin resistance on microalbuminuria development in a prospective Taiwanese cohort of type 2 diabetic subjects.

### Olmesartan for the delay or prevention of microalbuminuria in type 2 diabetes [^a561ec26]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2011). Excellent credibility.

The study ROADMAP was published by Hermann Haller and colleagues in 2011 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Diabetes mellitus type 2. In the ROADMAP study, the trial question was: what is the role of olmesartan in preventing the occurrence of microalbuminuria in patients with T2DM? In the ROADMAP study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the ROADMAP study, the population was: 4447 patients (2395 female, 2052 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients with T2DM. The key exclusion criteria were CrCl < 30 mL/min; severe uncontrolled hypertension; renal or renal-vascular disease; treatment with ARB or ACE inhibitors within 6 month prior to screening. In the ROADMAP study, the interventions were: n=2232 olmesartan (a dose of 40 mg once daily) n=2215 placebo (matching placebo tablets). In the ROADMAP study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in time to the first onset of microalbuminuria (722 days vs. 576 days; HR 1.3, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.59). In the ROADMAP study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in composite of cardiovascular complications or death from cardiovascular causes (4.3% vs. 4.2%; HR 1, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.33) Significant increase in decline in eGFR (4.9 vs. 1; MD 3.9, 95% CI 1.59 to 6.21) Significant increase in death from cardiovascular causes (0.7% vs. 0.1%; HR 4.94, 95% CI 1.43 to 17.06). In the ROADMAP study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in serious adverse events, renal events. significant difference in drug-related adverse events (11.4% vs. 7.5%). In the ROADMAP study, the conclusion was: in adult patients with T2DM, olmesartan was superior to placebo with respect to time to the first onset of microalbuminuria.

### More impact of microalbuminuria on retinopathy than moderately reduced GFR among type 2 diabetic patients [^88b816c3]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

This is the first study, to our knowledge, to compare the effect of microalbuminuria and moderate renal dysfunction in diabetic retinopathy in type 2 diabetic patients. In the follow-up of 7.6 years, our data revealed that the risks for renal outcome, cardiovascular events, and all-cause mortality were not significantly different between the patients of groups 2 and 3. However, microalbuminuria had a more predictive impact on the composite retinal outcome compared with patients with moderate renal impairment.

Intriguingly, our study showed that microalbuminuria significantly increases the risk for development and progression of diabetic retinopathy in type 2 diabetic patients even after adjustment for duration of diabetes, one of the most important predictors of diabetic retinopathy, and other comorbid conditions. Diabetic retinopathy and nephropathy seem to progress in a parallel manner. This may be because diabetic retinopathy shares similar pathophysiologic features with diabetic nephropathy. The classic clinical course of nephropathy in type 1 diabetes is the development of microalbuminuria, followed by macroalbuminuria and then by loss of GFR. In contrast, kidney disease in type 2 diabetes is more heterogeneous than that in type 1 diabetes. Albuminuria was absent in one-third of type 2 diabetic patients with chronic renal insufficiency according to the Third National Health and Nutrition Survey. In these patients, normoalbuminuria may be due to using blockers of the renin-angiotensin system or aggressive antihypertensive therapy. In fact, patients with diabetes are also susceptible to nondiabetic renal disease (NDRD) (–). Since microalbuminuria is a pathophysiologic surrogate of the underlying diabetic nephropathy, a decrease in GFR with normoalbuminuria in such patients sometimes may be due to superimposed nondiabetic renal disease or accelerated aging of the kidney. Therefore, in the current study, there is a significantly increased risk of development and progression of diabetic retinopathy for subjects with microalbuminuria and presumably through its influence on alterations in the microvasculature of retina and kidneys.

### Moderately increased albuminuria unmasked hypertension [^79dbcafb]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

The normal rate of albumin excretion is less than 30 mg/day (20 µg/min); persistent albumin excretion between 30 and 300 mg/day (20-200 µg/min) is called moderately increased albuminuria (formerly called microalbuminuria). In addition to being associated with diabetic nephropathy, moderately increased albuminuria has also been associated with cardiovascular disease in patients with as well as without diabetes. We present a case report of a man with moderately increased albuminuria who developed hypertension only detected by an ambulatory blood pressure monitoring procedure.

### Urinary L-FABP: a novel biomarker for evaluating diabetic nephropathy onset and progression. A narrative review [^bf724927]. Diabetes Therapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T1DM and T2DM) are at high risk of developing diabetic nephropathy (DN). This complication is the most common cause of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD), affecting approximately half of these patients. DN significantly increases the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and mortality and often necessitates costly, quality-of-life-disrupting renal replacement therapies, such as dialysis or kidney transplantation. Accordingly, its early prediction is crucial for timely interventions to stop or slow its natural progression. For these reasons, monitoring renal function through a fast, reliable, and easy-to-handle method in T1DM and T2DM is clinically crucial. Generally, laboratory findings of DN range from microalbuminuria to macroalbuminuria and increased plasma creatinine/decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Compared to plasma creatinine, albuminuria is time- and cost-effective for outpatients, requiring only a commercial dipstick for a urine spot test. However, since about 20% of diabetic patients with CKD may be normoalbuminuric, repeated efforts have been made to find a suitable urinary DN biomarker without microalbuminuria. DN is one of the most common complications of diabetes, accounting for 25–50% of T1DM and 45–57% of patients with T2DM, more than half (52.5%) of whom suffer from moderate-to-severe disease (stage 3-4). The most widely used method to assess impaired renal function is AER in terms of spot urine albumin/creatinine ratio (ACR). Despite being fast and cost-effective, such measurement is only partially reliable, as several patients with DN do not display increased AER. Also, the present best eGFR calculator (CKD-EPI) in people with diabetes has the bias of depending only on creatinine, age, and sex, so eGFR underestimation is quite likely to occur.

### Diabetic nephropathy [^a4afabc5]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2009). Low credibility.

Diabetic nephropathy is the leading cause of chronic renal disease and a major cause of cardiovascular mortality. Diabetic nephropathy has been categorized into stages: microalbuminuria and macroalbuminuria. The cut-off values of micro- and macroalbuminuria are arbitrary and their values have been questioned. Subjects in the upper-normal range of albuminuria seem to be at high risk of progression to micro- or macroalbuminuria and they also had a higher blood pressure than normoalbuminuric subjects in the lower normoalbuminuria range. Diabetic nephropathy screening is made by measuring albumin in spot urine. If abnormal, it should be confirmed in two out three samples collected in a three to six-months interval. Additionally, it is recommended that glomerular filtration rate be routinely estimated for appropriate screening of nephropathy, because some patients present a decreased glomerular filtration rate when urine albumin values are in the normal range. The two main risk factors for diabetic nephropathy are hyperglycemia and arterial hypertension, but the genetic susceptibility in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes is of great importance. Other risk factors are smoking, dyslipidemia, proteinuria, glomerular hyperfiltration and dietary factors. Nephropathy is pathologically characterized in individuals with type 1 diabetes by thickening of glomerular and tubular basal membranes, with progressive mesangial expansion (diffuse or nodular) leading to progressive reduction of glomerular filtration surface. Concurrent interstitial morphological alterations and hyalinization of afferent and efferent glomerular arterioles also occur. Podocytes abnormalities also appear to be involved in the glomerulosclerosis process. In patients with type 2 diabetes, renal lesions are heterogeneous and more complex than in individuals with type 1 diabetes. Treatment of diabetic nephropathy is based on a multiple risk factor approach, and the goal is retarding the development or progression of the disease and to decrease the subject's increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Achieving the best metabolic control, treating hypertension (<130/80 mmHg) and dyslipidemia (LDL cholesterol <100 mg/dl), using drugs that block the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, are effective strategies for preventing the development of microalbuminuria, delaying the progression to more advanced stages of nephropathy and reducing cardiovascular mortality in patients with diabetes.

Microalbuminuria

Twenty-three studies examined the presence of microalbuminuria and its correlation with AS [,,–,,,,,,,–,,,,,,,,,]. Six of them included patients with T1DM. The results, again, were expressed as OR, HR, correlation index (r), mean difference, or evaluation of statistical significance between diabetic patients with albuminuria and diabetic patients without albuminuria. Patients being transplanted or under dialysis were excluded from all studies, and cases of renal impairment due to non-DM relative causes were also excluded. Out of the 23 studies, 20 found a statistically significant correlation between AS and the presence of microalbuminuria in patients with DM. Furthermore, two studies underlined that the degree of albuminuria was more severe as the AS was greater. However, in one of these two studies, Tjessem et al. evaluated patients with T1DM during pregnancy and pointed out this association did not remain significant postpartum. Notably, only Tanokuchi et al. found no correlation between AS and the presence of microalbuminuria.

Again, as in diabetic retinopathy, many studies recognize DM duration as an independent factor for microalbuminuria development and progression. Shin et al. included Korean patients newly diagnosed with T2DM (mean disease duration six months) and also found a positive correlation between AS and the presence of microalbuminuria. Beyond disease duration, many studies have reported significantly raised AS and microalbuminuria with advanced age. Higher systolic blood pressure was independently associated with higher AS in three studies. Finally, only one study found a positive correlation of higher cfPWV with female gender.

### Development and progression of renal insufficiency with and without albuminuria in adults with type 1 diabetes in the diabetes control and complications trial and the epidemiology of diabetes interventions and complications study [^4b34236a]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

This multicenter study examined the impact of albumin excretion rate (AER) on the course of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and the incidence of sustained eGFR <60 ml/min/1.73 m(2) in type 1 diabetes up to year 14 of the Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications (EDIC) study (mean duration of 19 years in the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial [DCCT]/EDIC).

Research Design and Methods

Urinary albumin measurements from 4-h urine collections were obtained from participants annually during the DCCT and every other year during the EDIC study, and serum creatinine was measured annually in both the DCCT and EDIC study. GFR was estimated from serum creatinine using the abbreviated Modification of Diet in Renal Disease equation.

Results

A total of 89 of 1,439 subjects developed an eGFR <60 ml/min/1.73 m(2) (stage 3 chronic kidney disease on two or more successive occasions (sustained) during the DCCT/EDIC study (cumulative incidence 11.4%). Of these, 20 (24%) had AER <30 mg/24 h at all prior evaluations, 14 (16%) had developed microalbuminuria (AER 30-300 mg/24 h) before they reached stage 3 chronic kidney disease, and 54 (61%) had macroalbuminuria (AER >300 mg/24 h) before they reached stage 3 chronic kidney disease. Macroalbuminuria is associated with a markedly increased rate of fall in eGFR (5.7%/year vs. 1.2%/year with AER <30 mg/24 h, P < 0.0001) and risk of eGFR <60 ml/min/1.73 m(2) (adjusted hazard ratio 15.3, P < 0.0001), whereas microalbuminuria had weaker and less consistent effects on eGFR.

Conclusions

Macroalbuminuria was a strong predictor of eGFR loss and risk of developing sustained eGFR <60 ml/min/1.73 m(2). However, screening with AER alone would have missed 24% of cases of sustained impaired eGFR.

### Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers and combined therapy in patients with micro-and macroalbuminuria and other cardiovascular risk factors: a systematic review of randomized controlled trials [^aeb4687f]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2011). Low credibility.

Background

A recent clinical trial showed harmful renal effects with the combined use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and angiotensin-II receptor blockers (ARB) in people with diabetes or vascular disease. We examined the benefits and risks of these agents in people with albuminuria and one or more cardiovascular risk factors.

Methods

MEDLINE, EMBASE and Renal Health Library were searched for trials comparing ACEI, ARB or their combination with placebo or with one another in people with albuminuria and one or more cardiovascular risk factor.

Results

Eighty-five trials (21,708 patients) were included. There was no significant reduction in the risk of all-cause mortality or fatal cardiac-cerebrovascular outcomes with ACEI versus placebo, ARB versus placebo, ACEI versus ARB or with combined therapy with ACEI + ARB versus monotherapy. There was a significant reduction in the risk of nonfatal cardiovascular events with ACEI versus placebo but not with ARB versus placebo, ACEI versus ARB or with combined therapy with ACEI + ARB versus monotherapy. Development of end-stage kidney disease and progression of microalbuminuria to macroalbuminuria were reduced significantly with ACEI versus placebo and ARB versus placebo but not with combined therapy with ACEI + ARB versus monotherapy.

Conclusions

ACEI and ARB exert independent renal and nonfatal cardiovascular benefits while their effects on mortality and fatal cardiovascular disease are uncertain. There is a lack of evidence to support the use of combination therapy. A comparative clinical trial with ACE, ARB and its combination in people with albuminuria and a cardiovascular risk factor is warranted.

Risk Factors Associated with High Risk of CKD in T2D

It is well established that poor glycaemic control and elevated HbA1c is critical in the aetiology of CKD in people with T2D. Ten years of an intensive glycaemic control intervention in people with newly diagnosed T2D resulted in a 24% reduction in development of microvascular complications, including CKD, compared with conventional dietary therapy.

Increased urinary albumin excretion is a major risk factor for CKD. Whilst moderately increased urinary albumin excretion, i.e. 3–30 mg/mmol creatinine in a spot urine sample (microalbuminuria), is the first sign of CKD, people who develop severely increased albuminuria, i.e. more than 30 mg albumin/mmol creatinine in a spot urine sample (macroalbuminuria), are at particularly high risk for developing a decline in renal function.

Acute kidney injury is common condition, affecting 20% of all emergency admissions, and is an important risk factor for the development of CKD. We suggest that there should be regular monitoring for the development or progression of CKD after an acute kidney injury, even if serum creatinine has returned to baseline.

Consensus expert opinion concluded that additional risk factors which place individuals with T2D at high risk of CKD include co-existing diabetic complications such as CVD or HF, and longer duration of T2D (more than 10 years). CKD is uncommon if T2D is less than one decade in duration, and there are no other risk factors for CKD. Individuals with a longer duration of diabetes have a higher risk for developing CKD, with the highest incidence rates of 3% per year generally observed 10–20 years after diabetes onset, after which the rate of CKD tapers off.

Our consensus view based on the above discussion is that the presence of one or more of these factors should alert to the presence of kidney disease.

### Diabetic kidney disease: challenges, progress, and possibilities [^b231c872]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on diabetic nephropathy: 
- Definition: DN is a chronic microvascular complication of diabetes characterized by glomerular hyperfiltration, progressive albuminuria, and reduced GFR.
- Pathophysiology: DN is caused due to hyperfiltration and reduction of GFR mainly due to hyperglycemia, systemic hypertension, and obesity.
- Disease course: Clinical manifestations of DN include microalbuminuria, macroalbuminuria, hyperglycemia, refractory hypertension, diabetic retinopathy, nephrotic or nephritic syndrome, anemia, bone and mineral metabolism complications. Disease progression may lead to CVD, infections, ESRD, and death.
- Prognosis and risk of recurrence: 1-year mortality of patients on dialysis is around 21.5% in the US.

Nephropathy screening—A test for the presence of albuminuria should be performed in individuals at diagnosis of type 2 DM, and after the initial screening and in the absence of previously demonstrated macroalbuminuria, a test for the presence of microalbuminuria should be performed annually (IIIA). If an individual is taking an ACE inhibitor or ARB, there is no need for screening.

### Association of kidney disease measures with risk of renal function worsening in patients with type 1 diabetes [^bbd66de9]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Our data support the view that mild GFR reduction in patients with T1DM may be useful predictor of progression of GFR decline. Thus, microalbuminuria alone may not provide optimal identification of patients with T1DM at higher risk of renal impairment, measurements or estimation of GFR and identification of other risk factors will be surely useful.

### Epidemiology and prognostic significance of chronic kidney disease in the elderly – the three-city prospective cohort study [^87bb883d]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Little is known about normal kidney function level and the prognostic significance of low estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in the elderly.

Methods

We determined age and sex distribution of eGFR with both the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) study and the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equations in 8705 community-dwelling elderly aged ≥ 65 years and studied its relation to 6-year mortality. In a subsample of 1298 subjects examined at 4 years, we assessed annual eGFR decline and clinically relevant markers including microalbuminuria (3-30 mg/mmol creatinine) with diabetes, proteinuria ≥ 50 mg/mmol, haemoglobin <11 g/L or resistant hypertension despite three drugs.

Results

Median (interquartile range) MDRD eGFR was 78 (68-89) mL/min/1.73 m(2) in men and 74 (65-83) in women; there were 79 (68-87) and 77 (67-85) for CKD-EPI eGFR, respectively. Prevalence of MDRD eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) was 13.7% and of CKD-EPI eGFR was 12.9%. After adjustment for several confounders, only those with an eGFR <45 mL/min/1.73 m(2) had significantly higher all-cause and cardiovascular mortality than those with an eGFR of 75-89 mL/min/1.73 m(2) whatever the equation. In the subsample men and women with an MDRD eGFR of 45-59 mL/min/1.73 m(2), 15 and 13% had at least one clinical marker and 15 and 3% had microalbuminuria without diabetes, respectively; these percentages were 41 and 21% and 23 and 10% in men and women with eGFR <45, respectively. Mean MDRD eGFR decline rate was steeper in men than in women, 1.75 versus 1.41 mL/min/1.73 m(2)/year.

Conclusions

Moderately decreased eGFR is more often associated with clinical markers in men than in women. In both sexes, eGFR <45 mL/min/1.73 m(2) is related to poor outcomes. The CKD-EPI and the MDRD equations provide very similar prevalence and long-term risk estimates in this elderly population.

### Microalbuminuria in subjects with hypertension attending specialist blood pressure clinics [^3495ffa9]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2016). Low credibility.

Albuminuria is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease and target organ damage in patients with diabetes mellitus. In nondiabetic hypertensive patients, the threshold at which microalbuminuria (MAU) increases risk is unclear and there is evidence that cardiovascular risk may be increased in individuals with MAU levels lower than the usual recommended screening thresholds. We compared two definitions of MAU (on the basis of three early morning urine samples) in a cohort of hypertensive patients attending two specialist clinics in Scotland: conventional (MAU(C)) albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) >2.5-25mgmmol(-1) in males or >3.5-25mgmmol(-1) in females; and low-grade (MAU(L)) ACR 1.2-2.5 in males or 1.7-3.5mgmmol(-1) in females. Of the 1059 subjects screened, 786 (74%) were nondiabetic, with estimated glomerular filtration rate ⩾30mlmin(-1) per 1.73m(2) and without gross proteinuria (low-risk subset). The average age was 58±15 years, body mass index 30±6kgm(-2) and 46% were males. The prevalence of MAU(C) was 11% and 9.5% in the overall and low-risk subset, respectively, whereas MAU(L) prevalence was 11.1% and 10% respectively. The prevalence of cardiovascular disease was higher (24%) with albuminuria (both MAU(C) and MAU(L)) compared with 14% among those without albuminuria. The use of MAU(L) doubled the number of hypertensive subjects with increased cardiovascular risk who can be targeted for more rigorous risk reduction strategies. Consideration should be given to reducing the current threshold for MAU.

### Value of urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio as a predictor of type 2 diabetes in pre-diabetic individuals [^b88c2ce7]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

With the explosive growth of incident diabetes, type 2 diabetes has become a major international public health challenge. Moreover, an increasing number of individuals have evidence of a pre-diabetic state, which indicates significant future risk of developing diabetes. Fortunately, accumulating evidence suggests that type 2 diabetes can be delayed or prevented in individuals with pre-diabetes by either lifestyle modification or medication (–). However, because prevention is a fundamental public health goal, there is clearly a great need for effective strategies to identify high-risk individuals. Unfortunately, the best available risk stratification method is an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), which is both costly and difficult to perform in a clinical setting.

The albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) in a single untimed urinary specimen is a reflection of urinary albumin excretion and is increasingly being accepted as a marker that predicts several important health outcomes, including hypertension, kidney failure, cardiovascular events, and mortality (–). These associations have been observed throughout the biological range, even at levels far below those previously considered to be pathological (e.g. microalbuminuria).

The ACR is also closely linked to cardiometabolic risk factors, vascular disease, and insulin resistance (–) and might therefore play a clinically important role in predicting future onset of diabetes. Observational studies have shown an association between ACR and other markers of urinary albumin excretion and incident diabetes (–). In addition, observations that proteinuria-reducing therapies (e.g. ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers) delay progression to diabetes also support this hypothesis, albeit indirectly. However, the observational studies were heterogeneous in terms of study design and risk for incident diabetes, did not include proteinuria throughout its biologic range, and/or recruited individuals from ethnic groups distinct from the general U.S. population. In addition, a randomized clinical trial did not find that ramipril, a proteinuria-reducing agent, altered the incidence of diabetes.

The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) enrolled a large and well-characterized cohort of adults who were at high-risk for developing diabetes based on having elevated fasting glucose and impaired glucose tolerance. We tested the hypothesis that ACR, throughout its biological range, improves the prediction of future diabetes.
