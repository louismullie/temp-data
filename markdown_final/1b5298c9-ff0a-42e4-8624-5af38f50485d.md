## Question

Management of epidermidis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about managing Staphylococcus epidermidis infections across syndromes. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the organism's clinical significance and biofilm biology. Then, I should verify how to distinguish contamination from true infection. Next, I will review syndrome-specific management for catheter-related infections, prosthetic joint infections, endophthalmitis, and other device-related infections. After that, I need to check antimicrobial selection, including rifampin combinations and resistance considerations. Finally, I will integrate duration, monitoring, and multidisciplinary care, and close with special scenarios and a concise algorithmic summary, ensuring each point aligns with guidelines and available evidence [^115B1hm3] [^111u1hdh] [^11551unb].

> Let me first confirm the clinical significance and pathophysiology of Staphylococcus epidermidis, because I need to ensure I am not underestimating its virulence in device-related contexts. S. epidermidis is a leading cause of biofilm-associated infections on indwelling devices, with biofilm formation mediated by the ica operon and regulated by agr, sarA, and sigmaB, which collectively confer tolerance to antibiotics and host immunity, making eradication challenging and often requiring device intervention rather than antibiotics alone [^115AqQzV] [^111HmyTw] [^111wQSSd].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about every positive culture being pathogenic; I should double-check how to differentiate contamination from true infection. Coagulase-negative staphylococci are common skin and mucosal commensals, so clinical correlation, repeated cultures, and, when applicable, differential time to positivity help adjudicate catheter-related bloodstream infection versus contamination, and in prosthetic joint infection, preoperative synovial fluid analysis with cell count, differential, and culture improves diagnostic certainty before revision surgery [^113Vf9E9] [^114usXLr] [^115B1hm3].

> Next, I will examine catheter-related bloodstream infection management, and I need to ensure I align with high-quality guidance. For coagulase-negative staphylococci CRBSI, KDOQI recommends 14 days of antibiotics and allows guidewire exchange as a salvage strategy, whereas Staphylococcus aureus CRBSI mandates catheter removal and 4 weeks of therapy; observational data suggest S. epidermidis CRBSI may be salvaged more often than S. aureus, but I should confirm that persistent bacteremia or clinical deterioration still warrants removal and longer therapy [^11551unb] [^1167w7DV] [^11393pVT].

> Wait, let me verify prosthetic joint infection specifics because duration and rifampin use are easy to misstate. For staphylococcal PJI managed with debridement, antibiotics, and implant retention, IDSA recommends 2 to 6 weeks of pathogen-specific IV therapy combined with rifampin, followed by rifampin plus a companion oral agent for a total of 3 months for hips and 6 months for knees; if rifampin cannot be used, 4 to 6 weeks of IV therapy is advised, and for two-stage exchange arthroplasty, 2 to 6 weeks of IV therapy is typical, with consideration of chronic suppression in selected cases [^116Un3A2] [^111u1hdh] [^112NQ5Rz] [^111EaW4U] [^115Yti9K].

> I should confirm rifampin's role and caveats because resistance emerges quickly if used alone. Rifampin should never be used as monotherapy due to rapid resistance; it is paired with another active agent, ideally guided by susceptibilities, and requires careful attention to drug–drug interactions and tolerability, which is why infectious diseases oversight is prudent [^113Pqqfq].

> Let me consider endophthalmitis due to S. epidermidis, and I need to check whether device explantation is always necessary. Recent case series describe successful medical management of post-ICL S. epidermidis endophthalmitis with intravitreal vancomycin and ceftazidime, sometimes with adjunctive systemic or periocular steroids, avoiding ICL removal or pars plana vitrectomy when patients are closely monitored and respond clinically, though this remains evidence-limited and requires ophthalmology co-management [^116TYisg] [^1124iTpX] [^115vd36Z] [^115nKL9b].

> Next, I should review other device-related infections, and I need to ensure I do not overgeneralize. For cardiovascular implantable electronic device infections, staphylococci predominate; pocket infections are often due to coagulase-negative staphylococci and may present subtly, and management ranges from localized therapy for superficial infection to complete system extraction when there is deep infection or persistent bacteremia, guided by an electrophysiology–infectious diseases partnership [^113Hgc4j] [^112WjkR9] [^113d4qMf].

> I will now examine antimicrobial selection, and I should double-check that I am not conflating S. aureus guidance with S. epidermidis. For methicillin-susceptible S. epidermidis, beta-lactams such as cefazolin or nafcillin are appropriate; for methicillin-resistant isolates, vancomycin or daptomycin are reasonable, with susceptibility-guided narrowing once available; for PJI with implant retention, add rifampin to a backbone agent to mitigate biofilm tolerance, and for endophthalmitis, intravitreal vancomycin is commonly used empirically while cultures are pending [^111u1hdh] [^116Un3A2] [^116TYisg].

> But wait, what if small colony variants are present; I should verify their clinical impact. S. epidermidis small colony variants are associated with reduced remission rates in prosthetic joint infection and may exhibit altered susceptibility patterns, so identifying them can inform regimen selection and prognostic counseling, even though routine detection is not standardized in all laboratories [^1114tYXv].

> Next, I should review duration and monitoring, and I need to ensure I do not overextend therapy without evidence. For CoNS CRBSI, 14 days is standard if the catheter issue is addressed; for PJI, durations are syndrome-specific and often prolonged, with AAOS evidence suggesting that 8-week antibiotic courses can perform comparably to 3 to 6 months in retained-implant scenarios, though this does not negate the longer total durations recommended by IDSA for DAIR and two-stage strategies; serial clinical assessments, inflammatory markers, and repeat cultures guide response, and in persistent bacteremia or device-related infection, imaging for metastatic foci is warranted [^11551unb] [^115SCe2L] [^111u1hdh] [^116Un3A2].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of multidisciplinary care because device infections are rarely solved by antibiotics alone. Infectious diseases, orthopedic or cardiac surgery, ophthalmology, nephrology, or electrophysiology, and clinical microbiology should coordinate source control, antimicrobial stewardship, and follow-up planning, with shared decision-making when cure is uncertain and suppression or alternative strategies are considered [^111pc9f4] [^115B1hm3].

> Let me reconsider special scenarios briefly so I do not miss important nuances. In immunocompromised hosts, CoNS may behave more pathogenically and warrant a lower threshold for device removal and broader evaluation for metastatic infection; in pediatrics, many principles mirror adult care but dosing and device-specific pathways must be individualized; and although rare, invasive S. epidermidis soft tissue infections such as neonatal necrotizing fasciitis have been reported, underscoring the need to correlate microbiology with clinical severity and local epidemiology [^111HmyTw] [^111Z74AF].

> Finally, I will synthesize a practical algorithm and I should double-check that it aligns with the evidence base. First, confirm true infection versus contamination using clinical correlation and, when relevant, differential time to positivity or device-specific criteria; second, identify the infected device or focus and plan source control; third, obtain susceptibilities and start pathogen-appropriate therapy, adding rifampin for staphylococcal PJI with implant retention; fourth, tailor duration to the clinical syndrome and response, with 14 days for CoNS CRBSI after catheter management, 3 to 6 months for PJI depending on strategy, and close clinical and laboratory monitoring throughout; and fifth, engage multidisciplinary teams early and adjust plans based on response, including consideration of chronic suppression or device explantation if failure occurs [^11551unb] [^111u1hdh] [^116Un3A2] [^115B1hm3].

---

Management of Staphylococcus epidermidis infections centers on **source control** [^111XBsCZ] and **biofilm-active therapy** [^115AqQzV] because of its propensity for device-associated biofilm disease [^115AqQzV]. Remove or exchange infected devices when feasible [^11551unb]; for prosthetic joint infection, use **debridement with implant retention plus rifampin-based regimens** [^116Un3A2] or two-stage exchange [^112UC89r]. Treat catheter-related infections with 10–14 days of antibiotics and catheter removal or exchange [^11551unb]; for endocarditis, give 6 weeks of pathogen-directed therapy, adding an aminoglycoside or fluoroquinolone if resistance is present [^111VBp6H]. Base antibiotic selection on susceptibilities, favoring beta-lactams for methicillin-susceptible strains and vancomycin, daptomycin, or linezolid for methicillin-resistant strains [^115srBTr]; add rifampin for biofilm infections [^113Pqqfq]. Monitor for recurrence and complications, and use multidisciplinary care for complex cases [^111pc9f4].

---

## Clinical significance and pathogenesis

- **Biofilm formation**: S. epidermidis forms biofilms on medical devices, protecting bacteria from host immunity and antibiotics, leading to chronic, relapsing infections [^115AqQzV] [^111wQSSd].

- **Device-associated infections**: Common in prosthetic joints, catheters, pacemakers, and other implants [^115B1hm3].

- **Methicillin resistance**: High prevalence of methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis (MRSE), complicating therapy [^112NPfYZ].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

- **Clinical correlation**: Differentiate contamination from true infection using clinical context, repeat cultures, and device-related symptoms [^113d4qMf].

- **Imaging**: Use ultrasound, CT, or MRI to detect device-related infections or metastatic foci [^115srBTr].

- **Microbiological testing**: Obtain cultures from blood, device surfaces, or infected sites; use susceptibility testing to guide therapy [^115B1hm3].

---

## General management principles

### Source control

Source control is essential and includes **removal or exchange of infected devices** — such as catheters, prosthetic joints, or pacemakers — whenever feasible [^111XBsCZ] [^11551unb]. Surgical debridement is indicated to remove infected tissue and biofilm [^116Un3A2].

---

### Antibiotic therapy

- **Empiric therapy**: Start empiric antibiotics based on local resistance patterns, then tailor to susceptibilities [^115srBTr].

- **Methicillin-susceptible strains**: Use beta-lactams (e.g. cefazolin, nafcillin) [^115srBTr].

- **Methicillin-resistant strains**: Use vancomycin, daptomycin, or linezolid [^1149pVqY].

- **Biofilm-active therapy**: Add rifampin for device-related infections to enhance biofilm penetration [^113Pqqfq].

---

## Management of specific clinical scenarios

### Catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI)

- **Catheter management**: Remove or exchange the catheter; guidewire exchange may be considered for coagulase-negative staphylococci [^11551unb].

- **Antibiotic duration**: Treat for 10–14 days [^notfound].

- **Antibiotic selection**: Vancomycin or daptomycin for MRSE; beta-lactams for methicillin-susceptible strains [^notfound].

---

### Prosthetic joint infections (PJI)

- **Surgical options**: Debridement with implant retention (DAIR) or two-stage exchange arthroplasty [^112UC89r].

- **Antibiotic therapy**: Rifampin-based regimens for DAIR; 2–6 weeks IV therapy followed by oral therapy for 3–6 months [^116Un3A2].

- **Chronic suppression**: Consider indefinite oral suppression for high-risk patients [^notfound].

---

### Infective endocarditis

For infective endocarditis, provide **6 weeks of pathogen-directed therapy**, adding an aminoglycoside or fluoroquinolone if resistance is present [^111VBp6H]. Surgical valve replacement is indicated for prosthetic valve endocarditis or persistent infection [^notfound].

---

### Central nervous system (CNS) infections

Use **intravenous antibiotics with good CNS penetration** (e.g. vancomycin plus a third-generation cephalosporin). Treat for 2–3 weeks, extending to 4–6 weeks if a device is present.

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Monitoring and follow-up should include regular clinical assessments for signs of recurrence or complications. Obtain repeat cultures to confirm clearance and detect recurrence, and use imaging — such as ultrasound, CT, or MRI — to monitor response and detect complications [^115srBTr].

---

## Prevention strategies

Prevention strategies focus on **strict aseptic technique** during device insertion and maintenance. Apply antimicrobial coatings to devices when available, and implement surveillance programs to detect and manage infections early.

---

## Emerging therapies and research directions

Emerging therapies and research directions include **novel antibiofilm agents** under investigation to enhance biofilm penetration and eradicate resistant organisms [^114pBdJc]. Early device removal or exchange remains critical to successful outcomes, and multidisciplinary care involving infectious disease specialists, surgeons, and microbiologists optimizes management [^111pc9f4].

---

Management of S. epidermidis infections requires **source control, biofilm-active antibiotics, and multidisciplinary care** [^111pc9f4]. Early device intervention and susceptibility-guided therapy are key to successful outcomes.

### Maximizing positive outcomes for patients with staphylococcal infections [^114v9cps]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2009). Low credibility.

Maximizing positive outcomes for serious Gram-positive infections, such as those caused by Staphylococcus species, requires an aggressive treatment approach. Although specific approaches will depend upon many factors, the underlying common strategy should recognize the positive contribution of minimizing complications and inpatient treatment duration and the efficient use of healthcare resources, while also focusing on rapid resolution of infection and safety and tolerability. To advance the standard of care for patients, we need to utilize therapies that enable such a range of factors to be improved. Treatment guidelines are useful to establish evidence-based standards of care, but they are updated infrequently and there is currently no pan-European consensus for the treatment of staphylococcal infections. With the benefit of the clinical experience that has been acquired for the most recently licensed antibiotics, together with an appreciation of the appropriate usage of older agents, there are good prospects for achieving positive outcomes earlier and in a greater range of patients with staphylococcal infections, and treatment guidelines should be updated regularly to reflect this.

### Clinical management of Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia [^111XBsCZ]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2011). Medium credibility.

Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia is one of the most common serious bacterial infections worldwide. In the UK alone, around 12,500 cases each year are reported, with an associated mortality of about 30%, yet the evidence guiding optimum management is poor. To date, fewer than 1500 patients with S aureus bacteraemia have been recruited to 16 controlled trials of antimicrobial therapy. Consequently, clinical practice is driven by the results of observational studies and anecdote. Here, we propose and review ten unanswered clinical questions commonly posed by those managing S aureus bacteraemia. Our findings define the major areas of uncertainty in the management of S aureus bacteraemia and highlight just two key principles. First, all infective foci must be identified and removed as soon as possible. Second, long-term antimicrobial therapy is required for those with persistent bacteraemia or a deep, irremovable focus. Beyond this, the best drugs, dose, mode of delivery, and duration of therapy are uncertain, a situation compounded by emerging S aureus strains that are resistant to old and new antibiotics. We discuss the consequences on clinical practice, and how these findings define the agenda for future clinical research.

### The genetics of staphylococcal biofilm formation – will a greater understanding of pathogenesis lead to better management of device-related infection? [^115AqQzV]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2005). Low credibility.

Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus aureus are common causes of biofilm-mediated prosthetic device-related infection. The polysaccharide adhesion mechanism encoded by the ica operon is currently the best understood mediator of biofilm development, and represents an important virulence determinant. More recently, the contributions of other virulence regulators, including the global regulators agr, sarA and sigmaB, to the biofilm phenotype have also been investigated. Nevertheless, little has changed at the bedside; the clinical and laboratory diagnosis of device-related infection can be difficult, and biofilm resistance frequently results in failure of therapy. This review assesses the way in which advances in the understanding of biofilm genetics may impact on the clinical management of device-related infection.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^115sNUpw]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Infectious Diseases Society of America skin and soft tissue infection guideline — scope and methods are described as a panel of national experts was convened by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) to update the 2005 guidelines, with recommendations developed to be concordant with recently published IDSA guidelines for the treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA); the focus is diagnosis and appropriate treatment of diverse SSTIs from minor superficial infections to life-threatening infections such as necrotizing fasciitis, the guideline addresses SSTIs in immunocompromised hosts and emphasizes promptly diagnosing SSTIs, identifying the pathogen, and administering effective treatments; Figure 1 was developed to simplify management of localized purulent staphylococcal infections such as skin abscesses, furuncles, and carbuncles, Figure 2 is provided to simplify the approach to surgical site infections, and the panel used systematic weighting of strength of recommendation and quality of evidence using the GRADE system.

### Redefining Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia: a structured approach guiding diagnostic and therapeutic management [^111usLe4]. The Journal of Infection (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The framework proposed here for the classification and management of patients with SAB has the potential to solve the shortcomings of the current simplistic definition of uncomplicated and complicated SAB. It consists of four steps: (1) risk stratification for the presence of metastatic infection that (2) directs a diagnostic work-up in search for these infections leading to (3) 'final clinical diagnoses' corresponding with a general direction for treatment that (4) can be individualized to favorable clinical characteristics. This framework provides guidance to the clinician and a context for future research to improve patient outcome and individualized treatment.

### Successful antibiotic management of Staphylococcus epidermidis endophthalmitis after implantable collamer lens implantation [^116TYisg]. BMC Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

To conclude, Staphylococcus epidermidis endophthalmitis is manageable and can be recovered without loss of vision when diagnosed and treated in time and correctly. Good patient compliance plays an essential role in successful management of Staphylococcus epidermidis endophthalmitis post ICL avoiding the loss of the eye's integrity. The risk for endophthalmitis is rare but should be fully emphasized during preoperative counseling.

### Current guidelines and recommendations for the management of skin and soft tissue infections [^117MabCv]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The incidence of severe skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) has significantly increased over the last years. In addition, major ecological changes have been reported with the emergence of community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), involved in a large proportion of these cases. A large number of expert opinions, guidelines, and recommendations for the management of SSTIs have been published over the last decade. The purpose of this review is to compare these guidelines.

Recent Findings

A total of six official publications have presented recommendations for the management of SSTIs. During the same period, other guidelines for the management of MRSA infections have also been published, including some recommendations for SSTIs.

Summary

The applicability of the guidelines is questionable in many ways. The distinction between necrotizing/nonnecrotizing infections is valuable but difficult to apply prior to surgical management. The prescribers should choose a pragmatic approach to empirical antibiotic therapy, taking into account the patient's initial severity, the extent of infection and risk factors for resistant microorganisms essentially related to healthcare-associated circumstances.

### Fracture-related infections [^117QDs1Z]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

Fracture-related infections are challenging complications in orthopedic care, marked by infection at fracture or surgical sites, often involving biofilm-associated pathogens. They result in significant morbidity, prolonged hospitalizations, and high health care costs. Diagnosis integrates clinical, laboratory, and imaging findings, while treatment combines surgical debridement, implant management, and targeted antimicrobial therapy. Common pathogens include Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, with culture-negative cases requiring advanced diagnostics. A multidisciplinary approach is critical to optimizing outcomes, addressing complications, and reducing the socioeconomic impact of these infections. Advances in treatment strategies continue to improve survival and quality of life for affected patients.

### Redefining Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia: a structured approach guiding diagnostic and therapeutic management [^111pnDGz]. The Journal of Infection (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia (SAB) is characterized by a unique ability to involve metastatic infections in almost every organ system in the body. Around 20% of the patients with SAB die within 30 days. In patients with SAB, the distinction between uncomplicated and complicated SAB is therapeutically important, as guidelines recommend different treatment durations for these two entities. However, this dichotomous classification strategy can incompletely reflect the heterogeneity of SAB. In this viewpoint, we discuss the limitations of the currently used definitions for SAB. We then propose a new approach to define the extent of infection in patients with SAB, providing an individualized framework for diagnosis and treatment.

### Global differences in the management of Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia: No international standard of care [^112jHeYS]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

Large practice variations for SAB exist throughout the world, reflecting the absence of an international standard of care for the management of patients with SAB. This article sets the stage and the agenda for multinational or global clinical trials and networks, to address the unresolved aspects of this devastating disease.

### Two-stage total hip arthroplasty: how often does it control methicillin-resistant infection? [^111KfMPS]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Methicillin-resistant hip infections are increasingly common. Reports of the surgical management of these patients using two-stage THA show variable control of infection, but all reports used static spacers.

Questions/Purposes

We therefore determined (1) the rate of successful control of infection and (2) function in patients with methicillin-resistant infection treated with a two-stage THA using an articulated cement spacer during the first stage.

Methods

We retrospectively reviewed 50 patients who had a two-stage revision THA for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis infection. Twelve patients died, leaving 38 for review. All eligible patients completed quality-of-life outcome questionnaires (WOMAC, SF-12, Oxford-12, UCLA activity score, hip and knee satisfaction score). Minimum followup was 24 months after the second stage (mean, 58 months; range, 24–123 months).

Results

Of the 38 patients, eight (21%) had recurrence of their infection requiring further revision surgery. Of the remaining 27 patients, the mean WOMAC was 62, mean Oxford-12 60, mean UCLA activity score 4.3, and mean hip and knee satisfaction score 66.

Conclusions

We found a treatment failure rate of 21% for patients with methicillin-resistant S. aureus or methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis infection. This is a higher rate than reported for two-stage THA for studies including patients infected with both nonresistant and resistant organisms. The functional scores for patients were also lower than those reported in the literature.

Level Of Evidence

Level IV, therapeutic study. See Guidelines for Authors for a complete description of levels of evidence.

### Unusual aerobic and anaerobic bacteria associated with prosthetic joint infections [^116eaHXt]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2006). Low credibility.

The association of certain microorganisms, such as Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, and beta-hemolytic streptococci, with prosthetic joint infection (PJI) has been recognized for many years. To our knowledge, a systematic review of the presentation and management of less commonly encountered species of coagulase-negative staphylococci, nutritional-variant streptococci, aerobic non-spore and spore forming Gram-positive or anaerobic bacteria is not available. We therefore sought to provide a comprehensive literature review of PJI due to these microorganisms that will provide a valuable and quick reference for clinicians caring for these patients. We conducted a Medline search of all case reports and case series of PJI due to unusual aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. The presentation, surgical, and medical management strategies were reviewed. Appropriate medical and surgical management of such infections is complex and evolving as newer diagnostic tests, surgical techniques and antimicrobials become available. Management of patients with these infections requires close collaboration between the orthopaedic surgeon, infectious disease specialist and microbiology laboratory.

### Contemporary management of Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia-controversies in clinical practice [^111SQUPW]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia (SAB) carries a high risk for excess morbidity and mortality. Despite its prevalence, significant practice variation continues to permeate clinical management of this syndrome. Since the publication of the 2011 Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines on management of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections, the field of SAB has evolved with the emergence of newer diagnostic strategies and therapeutic options. In this review, we seek to provide a comprehensive overview of the evaluation and management of SAB, with special focus on areas where the highest level of evidence is lacking to inform best practices.

### Infection after shoulder surgery [^111S28Nv]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2011). Low credibility.

Infection after shoulder surgery is rare but potentially devastating. Normal skin flora, including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Propionibacterium acnes, are the most commonly isolated pathogens. Perioperative measures to prevent infection are of paramount importance, and clinical acumen is necessary for diagnosis. Superficial infections may be managed with local wound measures and antibiotics; deep infections require surgical débridement in combination with antibiotic treatment. Treating physicians must make difficult decisions regarding antibiotic duration and the elimination of the offending organisms by resection arthroplasty, direct implant exchange, or staged revision arthroplasty. Eradication of a deep infection is usually successful, but the course of treatment is often protracted, and tissue destruction and scar may adversely affect functional outcome.

### Redefining Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia: a structured approach guiding diagnostic and therapeutic management [^1137KxLf]. The Journal of Infection (2023). Medium credibility.

SUMMARY

The current duration of therapy in patients with Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia (SAB) is based on differentiating complicated from uncomplicated disease. While this approach allows clinicians and investigators to group SAB patients into broadly similar clinical categories, it fails to account for the intrinsic heterogeneity of SAB. This is due in part to the fact that risk factors for metastatic infection and confirmed metastatic infection are considered as equivalent in most scoring systems. In this viewpoint, we propose a two-step system of categorizing patients with SAB. Initially, patients with SAB would be categorized as 'high risk' or 'low risk' for metastatic infection based upon an initial set of diagnostic procedures. In the second step, patients identified as 'high-risk' would undergo additional diagnostic evaluation. The results of this stepwise diagnostic evaluation would define a 'final clinical diagnosis' to inform an individualized final treatment plan.

### Diagnosis and management of osteomyelitis [^113SBgXe]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

Acute osteomyelitis is the clinical term for a new infection in bone. This infection occurs predominantly in children and is often seeded hematogenously. In adults, osteomyelitis is usually a subacute or chronic infection that develops secondary to an open injury to bone and surrounding soft tissue. The specific organism isolated in bacterial osteomyelitis is often associated with the age of the patient or a common clinical scenario (i.e., trauma or recent surgery). Staphylococcus aureus is implicated in most patients with acute hematogenous osteomyelitis. Staphylococcus epidermidis, S. aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens and Escherichia coli are commonly isolated in patients with chronic osteomyelitis. For optimal results, antibiotic therapy must be started early, with antimicrobial agents administered parenterally for at least four to six weeks. Treatment generally involves evaluation, staging, determination of microbial etiology and susceptibilities, antimicrobial therapy and, if necessary, debridement, dead-space management and stabilization of bone.

### Staphylococcus-infected tunneled dialysis catheters: is over-the-wire exchange an appropriate management option? [^1167w7DV]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose

Over-the-wire exchange of tunneled dialysis catheters is the standard of care per K/DOQI guidelines for treating catheter-related bacteremia. However, Gram-positive bacteremia, specifically with staphylococcus species, may compromise over-the-wire exchange due to certain biological properties. This study addressed the effectiveness of over-the-wire exchange of staphylococcus-infected tunneled dialysis catheters compared with non-staphylococcus-infected tunneled dialysis catheters.

Methods

Patients who received over-the-wire exchange of their tunneled dialysis catheter due to documented or suspected bacteremia were identified from a QA database. Study patients (n = 61) had positive cultures for Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, or coagulase-negative staphylococcus not otherwise specified. Control patients (n = 35) received over-the-wire exchange of their tunneled dialysis catheter due to infection with any organism besides staphylococcus. Overall catheter survival and catheter survival among staphylococcal species were assessed.

Results

There was no difference in tunneled dialysis catheter survival between study and control groups (P = 0.46). Median survival time was 96 days for study catheters and 51 days for controls; survival curves were closely superimposed. There also was no difference among the three staphylococcal groups in terms of catheter survival (P = 0.31). The median time until catheter removal was 143 days for SE, 67 days for CNS, and 88 days for SA-infected catheters.

Conclusions

There is no significant difference in tunneled dialysis catheter survival between over-the-wire exchange of staphylococcus-infected tunneled dialysis catheters and those infected with other organisms.

### Global differences in the management of Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia: No international standard of care [^114VkSSW]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Staphylococcus aureus is the leading cause of mortality by bloodstream infections worldwide, and methicillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA) is the leading cause of mortality attributable to antimicrobial resistance. Despite its global distribution and an incidence of approximately 30 per 100 000 person-years, the optimal approach to S. aureus bacteremia (SAB) is poorly understood. Despite the fact that SAB has been a major theme in the medical literature for decades, basic treatment elements such as the optimal antibiotic regimen, the role of adjunct and oral antibiotics, the optimal treatment duration, and the definition of persistent SAB remain fundamentally unknown. Even less is known about global differences in treatment practices for SAB.

The aim of this study was to identify global variation in management, diagnostics, and definitions of SAB. To do this, we used a variety of social media platforms to reach a large number of clinicians throughout the world for a survey on SAB treatment practices.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^116BbNeu]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

A panel of national experts was convened by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) to update the 2005 guidelines for the treatment of skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs). The panel's recommendations were developed to be concordant with the recently published IDSA guidelines for the treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections. The focus of this guideline is the diagnosis and appropriate treatment of diverse SSTIs ranging from minor superficial infections to life-threatening infections such as necrotizing fasciitis. In addition, because of an increasing number of immunocompromised hosts worldwide, the guideline addresses the wide array of SSTIs that occur in this population. These guidelines emphasize the importance of clinical skills in promptly diagnosing SSTIs, identifying the pathogen, and administering effective treatments in a timely fashion.

### Staphylococcus epidermidis small colony variants, clinically significant quiescent threats for patients with prosthetic joint infection [^1114tYXv]. Microbes and Infection (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Staphylococcus epidermidis is a leading cause of prosthetic joint infection. Its relevance is based on its high ability to develop biofilm and small colony variants. However, the clinical associations between this bacterial subpopulation and prosthetic joint infections remain highly uncertain. We aimed to define the clinical characteristics and outcome of patients affected by S. epidermidis small colony variants, as well as their antimicrobial susceptibility.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients with monomicrobial prosthetic joint infection. Clinical data and time to remission after prosthesis removal was compared between groups. Antimicrobial susceptibility of small colony variants and wild type strains were analyzed.

Results

S. epidermidis small colony variants were identified in 16 (37.20%) cultures from eligible subjects. These patients were less likely to achieve remission throughout the follow-up period (Hazard ratio, 0.45 [95% CI, 0.22–0.89], p = 0.02), compared to those with wild type strains. In vitro experiments showed higher resistant rates to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (62.5%), and lower resistant rates to levofloxacin (37.5%), among small colony variants.

Conclusions

The isolation of small colony variants was negatively associated with remission achievement throughout management. The search for this bacterial subpopulation and its antimicrobial susceptibility may be appropriate to adjust treatment and clinical expectations.

### Management of infections of osteoarticular prosthesis [^112UC89r]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2006). Low credibility.

Prosthetic joint infections are an uncommon complication of joint replacement surgery, but are associated with significant morbidity and costs when they do occur. Gram-positive cocci, in particular Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, are the most commonly recovered microorganisms (≥ 50% of all isolates). About 60% of prosthetic joint infections probably occur by direct contamination during the operative procedure. Certain systemic conditions in the patients, as well as foreign material, have been identified as risk factors for prosthetic joint infection. The clinical diagnosis is only certain when there are sinus tracts that reach the prosthesis or purulent secretion is obtained from joint aspiration or during open surgery. The treatment of an infected joint prosthesis must be individualised, but it generally involves both systemic antibiotics and surgical intervention. Exchange arthroplasty in one or two stages continues to be the standard approach to management. Prosthesis retention, in conjunction with debridement and prolonged (for at least 3 months) oral antibiotic therapy, can be an alternative for early postoperative or late acute haematogenous infections, when the duration of symptoms is less than 1 month, the implant is stable, and the pathogen is relatively avirulent and sensitive to an orally well absorbed antibiotic. Good results have been achieved under these conditions in staphylococcal infections with rifampin associated with quinolones and other antibiotics, e.g., cotrimoxazole, fusidic acid, and linezolid.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^112Urvcy]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Strength of recommendation and quality of evidence — The grading framework includes categories such as "Strong recommendation, high-quality evidence" where "Desirable effects clearly outweigh undesirable effects, or vice versa" and "Consistent evidence from well-performed RCTs or exceptionally strong evidence from unbiased observational studies", with the implication that "Recommendation can apply to most patients in most circumstances. Further research is unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect". For "Weak recommendation, high-quality evidence", "Desirable effects closely balanced with undesirable effects" and the same high-quality evidence standard apply, with the implication that "The best action may differ depending on circumstances or patient's or societal values. Further research is unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect". Lower-quality tiers are also detailed, including "Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence", where "Recommendation may change when higher-quality evidence becomes available", and "Weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence", where "Other alternatives may be equally reasonable" and "Any estimate of effect, for at least 1 critical outcome, is very uncertain".

### AAOS systematic literature review: summary on the management of surgical site infections [^115SCe2L]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2019). High credibility.

Antibiotic duration for management of surgical site infections — in the setting of retained total joint arthroplasty, moderate evidence supports that antibiotic protocols of 8 weeks do not result in significantly different outcomes when compared to protocols of 3 to 6-month duration, with Strength of Recommendation: Moderate. Supporting studies found no significant difference in resolution of infection according to treatment duration, including a study in which patients were randomized to either eight weeks or three (hips) or six (knees) months with similar resolution, and another that compared short term (two months for hips and three months for knees) to previously used long term (three months for hips and six months for knees) with no difference in success. While antibiotic duration may not impact likelihood of cure, long term suppression may reduce the risk of relapse for patients who are not cured, and the benefit of chronic antibiotic suppression was only seen for patients with Staphylococcus aureus infection managed with implant retention. There are no known harms associated with implementation of this recommendation.

### AAOS systematic literature review: summary on the management of surgical site infections [^113Pqqfq]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2019). High credibility.

Rifampin use for management of surgical site infections — Moderate evidence supports that rifampin, as a second antimicrobial, increases the probability of treatment success for staphylococcal infections in the setting of retained orthopaedic implants, and the Strength of Recommendation: Moderate. Very few high quality studies were identified and work addressing the addition of Rifampin and its effect on infection resolution in the setting of debridement and implant retention found that patients who were randomized to receive rifampin as part of their treatment regimen had a lower risk of treatment failure. Possible harms of implementation are emphasized: Rifampin should never be used in monotherapy, it has many potentially adverse drug interactions and its use is best-directed by infectious disease specialists or in conjunction with a pharmacist, and Rifampin is not always well-tolerated. Future research is needed to define optimal abx protocols in areas other than joint replacement and organisms other than staph, with very little data on the optimal antibiotic regimen for orthopaedic surgical site infection, especially for implants outside of joint replacement and microbes other than Staphylococcus.

### A European survey of antibiotic management of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection: current clinical opinion and practice [^117XshGh]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2010). Low credibility.

Although the epidemiology of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) varies across Europe, healthcare-associated MRSA infections are common in many countries. Despite several national guidelines, the approach to treatment of MRSA infections varies across the continent, and there are multiple areas of management uncertainty for which there is little clinical evidence to guide practice. A faculty, convened to explore some of these areas, devised a survey that was used to compare the perspectives of infection specialists from across Europe on the management of MRSA infections with those of the faculty specialists. The survey instrument, a web-based questionnaire, was sent to 3840 registered delegates of the 19th European Congress of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, held in April 2009. Of the 501 (13%) respondents to the survey, 84% were infection/microbiology specialists and 80% were from Europe. This article reports the survey results from European respondents, and shows a broad range of opinion and practice on a variety of issues pertaining to the management of minor and serious MRSA infections, such as pneumonia, bacteraemia, and skin and soft tissue infections. The issues include changing epidemiology, when and when not to treat, choice of treatment, and duration and route of treatment. The survey identified areas where practice can be improved and where further research is needed, and also identified areas of pan-European consensus of opinion that could be applied to European guidelines for the management of MRSA infection.

### Coagulase-negative staphylococcal infections [^113Vf9E9]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) are differentiated from the closely related but more virulent Staphylococcus aureus by their inability to produce free coagulase. Currently, there are over 40 recognized species of CNS. These organisms typically reside on healthy human skin and mucus membranes, rarely cause disease, and are most frequently encountered by clinicians as contaminants of microbiological cultures. However, CNS have been increasingly recognized to cause clinically significant infections. The conversion of the CNS from symbiont to human pathogen has been a direct reflection of the use of indwelling medical devices. This article deals with the clinical syndromes, epidemiology, prevention, and management of infections caused by this unique group of organisms.

### Prosthetic knee infection with coagulase-negative Staphylococcus: a harbinger of poor outcomes [^112NPfYZ]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) are biofilm-producing pathogens whose role in periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) is increasing. There is little data on the prognosis and treatment considerations in the setting of PJI. We sought to evaluate the clinical characteristics, outcomes, and complications in these patients.

Methods

This is a retrospective cohort study of adult patients at a single tertiary medical center from 2009 to 2020 with culture-proven CoNS PJI after total knee arthroplasty, as diagnosed by Musculoskeletal Infection Society criteria. The primary outcome was treatment success, with failure defined as recurrent CoNS PJI, recurrent PJI with a new pathogen, and/or chronic oral antibiotic suppression at one year postoperatively.

Results

We identified 55 patients with a CoNS total knee arthroplasty PJI with a mean follow-up of 29.8 months (SD: 16.3 months). The most commonly isolated organism was Staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 36, 65.5%). The overall prevalence of methicillin resistance was 63%. Surgical treatment included surgical debridement, antibiotics, and implant retention in 25 (45.5%) cases and two-stage revision (22 articulating and eight static antibiotic-impregnated spacers). At one-year follow-up, only 47% of patients had successful management of their infection. The surgical debridement, antibiotics, and implant retention cohort had the higher rate of treatment failure (60.0%) compared to two-stage revision (46.7%).

Conclusion

These results indicate a poor rate of success in treating CoNS PJI. This likely represents the interplay of inherent virulence through biofilm formation and decreased antibiotic efficacy.

### From prevention to treatment: comprehensive strategies for the management of Staphylococcus aureus induced catheter-related bloodstream infections [^116Tq7cj]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2025). Medium credibility.

Staphylococcus aureus (SA) is a prominent pathogen that frequently causes catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSIs) in hemodialysis patients with tunneled central lines. The guidelines' key recommendation for managing SA-induced CRBSIs is to remove the infected catheter. In real life, however, this may be hindered by logistical or clinical problems (e.g. unavailability of surgical rooms, incarcerated catheters, catheter-associated thrombosis). Furthermore, an interventional approach may expose patients to complications, such as those related to the procedure itself or the development of central vein stenoses. Prospective observational studies seem to support the possibility of preserving the infected line in case of early pathogen identification and CRBSI management with empirical large-spectrum antibiotics, followed by targeted treatment once the antibiogram is available. Further options for the treatment and prevention of SA-induced infections are becoming available, leading to a rapidly evolving therapeutic scenario. This review aims to perform a multidisciplinary revision of the available evidence and current unsolved problems, focusing on future perspectives for the management and prevention of SA-induced CRBSIs in hemodialysis patients.

### 2017 HRS expert consensus statement on cardiovascular implantable electronic device lead management and extraction [^113d4qMf]. Heart Rhythm (2017). Medium credibility.

Blood culture positivity and superficial incisional infection — device management: Generally, a single positive blood culture with no other clinical evidence of infection should not result in removal of the CIED system. However, Staphylococcus aureus should always be considered a pathogen, and evaluation for a likely source should be undertaken. Superficial or incisional infection without device involvement is not an indication for CIED removal. Superficial incisional infection involves only skin and the subcutaneous tissue of the incision, not penetrating to the deep soft tissues (eg, fascia and/or muscle) of the incision, and does not present late after a CIED intervention. Patients with superficial incisional infection or hematoma can present early after CIED intervention with signs of inflammation, such as pain, tenderness, erythema, and local warmth; the patient should be closely followed for progression to a deeper infection, which would require extraction, and Seven to 10 days of oral antibiotic therapy with activity against staphylococci is reasonable.

### Management and prevention of Staphylococcus aureus infections in children [^111vwbcy]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Staphylococcus aureus is a common skin commensal with the potential to cause severe infections resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. Up to 30% of individuals are colonized with S aureus, though infection typically does not occur without skin barrier disruption. Infection management includes promptly addressing the source of infection, including sites of metastatic infection, and initiation of effective antibiotics, which should be selected based on local antibiotic susceptibility patterns. Given that S aureus colonization is a risk factor for infection, preventive strategies are aimed at optimizing hygiene measures and decolonization regimens for outpatients and critically ill children with prolonged hospitalizations.

Staphylococcus aureus is a known cause of a variety of illnesses that present to the emergency department, including skin and soft tissue infections, pneumonia, and sepsis. Managing these conditions has become more difficult with the emergence of bacterial strains in the community that are resistant to traditional first-line antibiotics. Emergency care providers need to be aware of the increased prevalence of these resistant bacteria, to understand the characteristics of the infections with which they are associated, and to know the effective antibiotic options for treating these bacterial infections in the emergency department patient population.

The increased incidence over the past decade of bloodstream infections (BSIs) caused by gram-positive bacteria, particularly methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, highlights the critical need for a consistent approach to therapy. However, there is currently no international consensus on the diagnosis and management of gram-positive BSIs. The Clinical Consensus Conference on Gram-Positive Bloodstream Infections was convened as a session at the 9th International Symposium on Modern Concepts in Endocarditis and Cardiovascular Infections held in 2007. Participants discussed various aspects of the practical treatment of patients who present with gram-positive BSI, including therapeutic options for patients with BSIs of undefined origin, the selection of appropriate empirical therapy, and treatment of complicated and uncomplicated BSIs. The opinions of participants about these key issues are reflected in this article.

### Redefining Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia: a structured approach guiding diagnostic and therapeutic management [^1114vmaQ]. The Journal of Infection (2023). Medium credibility.

Shortcomings of the current classification

The major limitation of including predisposing host characteristics, features of bacteremia, and the clinical course (see below) in the definition of complicated SAB is that they increase the risk of metastatic infection and are not, in themselves, metastatic infection. As a result, it is possible for patients at risk for metastatic infection but without its confirmed presence to be diagnosed with and treated presumptively for complicated SAB. In addition, the current classification can discourage a precise clinical diagnosis, since SAB encompasses a much wider range of clinical manifestations than uncomplicated and complicated SAB. Explicitly defining patient characteristics and SAB diagnosis would allow a more personalized treatment including shorter durations of intravenous (IV) therapy and more convenient routes of administration. -

### Necrotizing fasciitis caused by Staphylococcus epidermidis in a neonate with extremely low birthweight [^111Z74AF]. The Journal of Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Necrotizing fasciitis (NF) is a severe life-threatening soft tissue infection characterized by rapidly spreading necrosis of the fascia and the subcutaneous tissue. The initial skin presentation ranges from minimal rash to cellulites. The lesions subsequently spread rapidly. Even with appropriate medical and surgical therapy, the mortality rate in NF is more than 50%. In cases of neonates, mortality rate is higher than that ratio. High index of suspicion, prompt aggressive surgery, appropriate antibiotics and supportive care are the mainstays of management in the newborn infant with NF. Herein, we report a case of invasive and mortal NF caused by Staphylococcus epidermidis in an infant with extremely low birthweight.

### Improving the management of Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia, including MRSA [^1155cCbY]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Problem

Staphylococcus aureus is a common cause of both community and hospital acquired bacteraemia, and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The management of Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia is multi-faceted. It often requires prolonged courses of antimicrobial therapy as well as a thorough assessment and investigations to identify the source and seek any complications, such as metastatic foci. Given the meticulous approach required when treating patients with S. aureus bacteraemia, there is potential for some aspects of optimal management to be missed, especially in an environment where time and bed space are at a premium. Failure of any aspect of the optimal management, however, is associated with negative patient outcomes.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2006). Medium credibility.

Infective endocarditis — etiology, prognosis, and epidemiology: Infective endocarditis may be subacute or acute; the subacute form is "most often related to infections with streptococcal species and less commonly with Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, and fastidious Haemophilus sp", typically developing on abnormal valves after asymptomatic bacteremias. Acute endocarditis is more often related to S. aureus, group A hemolytic streptococci, pneumococci, or gonococci and "can develop on normal valves". "Untreated endocarditis is almost always fatal". Prosthetic valve endocarditis forms a substantial proportion of cases; although incidence "has not changed over the past 3 decades", the age at presentation has increased. Right‑sided disease is often related to intravenous drug abuse, and aortic/mitral valve endocarditis "has been associated with rapid death" due to acute valvular disruption, coronary emboli, or ring/septal abscesses.

### Clinical management of dialysis catheter-related bacteremia with concurrent exit-site infection [^11393pVT]. Seminars in Dialysis (2011). Low credibility.

Dialysis catheter-related bacteremia (CRB) can frequently be treated with systemic antibiotics, in conjunction with an antibiotic lock, in an attempt to salvage the catheter. It is unknown whether CRB associated with an exit-site infection can be treated with such an approach. We retrospectively queried a prospective, computerized vascular access database, and identified 1436 episodes of CRB, of which 64 cases had a concurrent exit site. The frequency of concurrent exit-site infection was 9.6% with Staphylococcus epidermidis, 6.1% with Staphylococcus aureus, and only 0.7% with Gram negative CRB (p < 0.001 for Staphylococcus vs. Gram negative rods). Five serious complications (four major sepses and one endocarditis) occurred in 24 patients with S. aureus infection, but none in 32 episodes of S. epidermidis infection (p = 0.01). Catheter survival was significantly shorter in patients with S. aureus infections. The median catheter survival (without infection or dysfunction) was 14 days with S. aureus vs. 30 days with S. epidermidis infection (p = 0.035). In conclusion, concurrent exit-site infection is seen most commonly in association with Staphylococcal CRB. When the infecting organism is S. epidermidis, attempted salvage with systemic antibiotics and an antibiotic lock is reasonable. However, prompt catheter removal is indicated when the pathogen is S. aureus.

### Clinical management of catheter-related infections [^114usXLr]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2002). Low credibility.

Central venous catheters represent a major source of nosocomial bloodstream infections, which cause considerable excess morbidity. It is currently unknown to what extent these infections contribute to mortality. Most catheter-related infections (CRIs) are caused by Gram-positive organisms (mainly coagulase-negative staphylococci). Definite diagnosis of CRI necessitates removal of the catheter in most cases. However, the recently described technique of differential time to positivity may allow diagnosis of CRI with the catheter left in place. Removal of the catheter has been standard clinical practice for the management of CRI in the past and is still recommended in many cases. In specific situations, such as infections of implanted catheters with coagulase-negative staphylococci, a trial of catheter salvage may be justified. In catheter-related bloodstream infection Staphylococcus aureus and Candida spp., the catheter should be removed immediately, due to the high risk of metastatic infection and increased mortality. A clinical work-up for the detection of additional foci (including transesophageal echocardiography in S. aureus infections) is advisable in these cases. All CRIs should be treated with antibiotics to which the causative agent has been shown to be susceptible. In addition to systemic antimicrobial therapy, antibiotic lock therapy may be applied, especially in patients with implanted long-term catheters if catheter salvage is attempted.

### Successful antibiotic management of Staphylococcus epidermidis endophthalmitis after implantable collamer lens implantation [^115mf2YF]. BMC Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

Test the virulence and antibiotic susceptibilities and resistance traits of Staphylococcus epidermidis strains causing postoperative endophthalmitis may offer more helpful information in the treatment selection and prognostic evaluation in a clinical setting. To our knowledge, Staphylococcus epidermidis isolates were sensitive to vancomycin. ICL explantation would be required in cases of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis. In our case, intraocular vancomycin and ceftazidime was used for empiric coverage of gram-positive and gram-negative organisms in the primary procedure, the Staphylococcus epidermidis endophthalmitis post ICL responded well to intravitreal antibiotics, avoiding the necessity of pars plana vitrectomy.

Slit lamp evaluation is critical in diagnosing, predicting the causative organisms, and guiding the therapeutic decisions before the microbiologic confirmation. In our case, the treatment started with intravitreal injection and system administration of antibiotics accompanied by intensive topical steroids and antibiotics before the culture confirmation. An ultrasonography B-scan can assist in the diagnosis. The close follow-up of this endophthalmitis patient enables strict postoperative surveillance on the effect of medication treatment, avoiding the removal of the ICL or pars plana vitrectomy.

### National guidelines for the control and prevention of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus – what do they tell us? [^115yg3Ws]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2007). Low credibility.

Guidelines to control and prevent methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection are available in many countries. Infection control and prevention teams determine local strategies using such national guidelines, but not all guidelines involve a rigorous assessment of the literature to determine the strength of the recommendations. Available guidelines drafted by national agencies or prominent professional organisations in Germany, New Zealand, North America, The Netherlands, Ireland and the UK were reviewed. Significant literature reviews were a component of guidelines from the UK and North America. Recommendations were not graded on the strength of the evidence in guidelines from New Zealand and The Netherlands. The Netherlands, a country with a very low prevalence of MRSA, had the simplest set of guidelines. Few of the recommendations in any of the guidelines achieved the highest grading, i.e., based on well-designed, experimental, clinical or epidemiological studies, even though the logic of the proposed measures is clear. The onset of community-acquired MRSA is reflected in the recent publication of guidelines from North America. New developments, such as rapid testing and mathematical modelling, are of importance in helping to control MRSA in settings of both low and high endemicity. National guidelines are increasingly evidence-based, although good scientific studies concerning some aspects of MRSA control are lacking. However, general principles, e.g., early detection and isolation, are recommended by all guidelines. There is still a role for consensus and the opinion of experts in devising national guidelines.

### Management of Staphylococcus aureus infections [^111Bp53U]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Because of high incidence, morbidity, and antimicrobial resistance, Staphylococcus aureus infections are a growing concern for family physicians. Strains of S. aureus that are resistant to vancomycin are now recognized. Increasing incidence of unrecognized community-acquired methicillin-resistant S. aureus infections pose a high risk for morbidity and mortality. Although the incidence of complex S. aureus infections is rising, new antimicrobial agents, including daptomycin and linezolid, are available as treatment. S. aureus is a common pathogen in skin, soft-tissue, catheter-related, bone, joint, pulmonary, and central nervous system infections. S. aureus bacteremias are particularly problematic because of the high incidence of associated complicated infections, including infective endocarditis. Adherence to precautions recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, especially handwashing, is suboptimal.

### Management of Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia: a review [^115srBTr]. JAMA (2025). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Staphylococcus aureus, a gram-positive bacterium, is the leading cause of death from bacteremia worldwide, with a case fatality rate of 15% to 30% and an estimated 300 000 deaths per year.

Observations

Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia causes metastatic infection in more than one-third of cases, including endocarditis (≈12%), septic arthritis (7%), vertebral osteomyelitis (≈4%), spinal epidural abscess, psoas abscess, splenic abscess, septic pulmonary emboli, and seeding of implantable medical devices. Patients with S aureus bacteremia commonly present with fever or symptoms from metastatic infection, such as pain in the back, joints, abdomen or extremities, and/or change in mental status. Risk factors include intravascular devices such as implantable cardiac devices and dialysis vascular catheters, recent surgical procedures, injection drug use, diabetes, and previous S aureus infection. Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia is detected with blood cultures. Prolonged S aureus bacteremia (≥ 48 hours) is associated with a 90-day mortality risk of 39%. All patients with S aureus bacteremia should undergo transthoracic echocardiography; transesophageal echocardiography should be performed in patients at high risk for endocarditis, such as those with persistent bacteremia, persistent fever, metastatic infection foci, or implantable cardiac devices. Other imaging modalities, such as computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging, should be performed based on symptoms and localizing signs of metastatic infection. Staphylococcus aureus is categorized as methicillin-susceptible (MSSA) or methicillin-resistant (MRSA) based on susceptibility to β-lactam antibiotics. Initial treatment for S aureus bacteremia typically includes antibiotics active against MRSA such as vancomycin or daptomycin. Once antibiotic susceptibility results are available, antibiotics should be adjusted. Cefazolin or antistaphylococcal penicillins should be used for MSSA and vancomycin, daptomycin, or ceftobiprole for MRSA. Phase 3 trials for S aureus bacteremia demonstrated noninferiority of daptomycin to standard of care (treatment success, 53/120 [44%] vs 48/115 [42%]) and noninferiority of ceftobiprole to daptomycin (treatment success, 132/189 [70%] vs 136/198 [69%]). Source control is a critical component of treating S aureus bacteremia and may include removal of infected intravascular or implanted devices, drainage of abscesses, and surgical debridement.

Conclusions and Relevance

Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia has a case fatality rate of 15% to 30% and causes 300 000 deaths per year worldwide. Empirical antibiotic treatment should include vancomycin or daptomycin, which are active against MRSA. Once S aureus susceptibilities are known, MSSA should be treated with cefazolin or an antistaphylococcal penicillin. Additional clinical management consists of identifying sites of metastatic infection and pursuing source control for identified foci of infection.

### Successful antibiotic management of Staphylococcus epidermidis endophthalmitis after implantable collamer lens implantation [^1124iTpX]. BMC Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

We report a case of successful medical management of endophthalmitis post implantable collamer lens (ICL) culture-positive of Staphylococcus epidermidis.

Observations

A 18-year-old female presented with decreased visual acuity in the left eye 20 days after ICL implantation. A diagnosis of postoperative endophthalmitis was made based on examination and ultrasonography. A vitreous tap was taken, and intravitreal antibiotics (vancomycin 1 mg/0.1ml and ceftazidime 2 mg/0.1ml) were administered twice (every 72 h), and peribulbar injection of triamcinolone acetonide after four days of the second intravitreal injection. The vitreous culture was confirmed for Staphylococcus epidermidis. The endophthalmitis was resolved, and visual acuity improved from 6/20 to 12/20 on day 7 and 22/20 on day 38. This is the first successful medical resolution of Staphylococcus epidermidis endophthalmitis post ICL surgery without ICL explantation and vitrectomy in the V4c model.

Conclusions and Importance

In antibiotic therapy, the excellent compliance and close follow-up of this endophthalmitis patient enabled careful postoperative surveillance on the effect of antibiotic therapy, avoiding the removal of the ICL or the loss of the integrity of the eye. The risk of potential infectious endophthalmitis post-ICL surgery should be fully emphasized during preoperative counseling.

Tertiary peritonitis represents an infection that is persistent or recurrent at least 48 hours after appropriate management of primary or secondary peritonitis. It is more common among critically ill or immunocompromised patients. Because of the poor host defenses, it is also often associated with less virulent organisms, such as Enterococcus, Candida, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Enterobacter.

Intra-abdominal sepsis is an IAI that results in severe sepsis or septic shock.

### Transcatheter aortic valve replacement: a palliative approach to infective endocarditis [^113peB5q]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

Background

Despite medical advances and new therapies, infective endocarditis has an extremely high 1-year mortality risk of 30% that has not improved. Patients presenting with endocarditis are often older and with multiple comorbidities. While staphylococcal microorganisms are the most common cause of endocarditis, coagulase-negative staphylococci such as Staphylococcus epidermidis are less common and when present typically involve prosthetic valve endocarditis or hospital-acquired native valve endocarditis. Nosocomial infection has an even greater mortality, often occurring in patients already acutely ill. Antibiotic therapy and surgery are key components of the management of infective endocarditis, and because of the high mortality, it is recommended to have a multispecialty team approach to the disease.

Our patient was critically ill with infective endocarditis complicated by cardiogenic shock, but with his advanced age and comorbidities, there was a joint decision with the patient to not pursue surgical intervention. After his subsequent clinical decline into critical condition with aggressive medical therapy, the patient and family requested full-spectrum palliative measures. A focus of this case is an alternative palliative therapy with transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) for symptomatic and clinical improvement.

### How to manage treatment failure in prosthetic joint infection [^111pc9f4]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Management for prosthetic joint infections remains a challenging area for both infectious diseases and orthopaedic surgery, particularly in the setting of treatment failure. This is compounded by a lack of level 1 evidence to guide approaches. The optimal management of prosthetic joint infections requires a multi-disciplinary approach combined with shared decision making with the patient.

Aims

This article describes the approach to prosthetic joint infections in the setting of treatment failure.

Sources

Narrative review based on literature review from PubMed. There was no time limit on the studies included. In addition, the reference list for included studies were reviewed for literature saturation with manual searching of clinical guidelines. Management approaches described incorporate evidence- and eminence-based recommendations from expert guidelines and clinical studies, where applicable.

Content

The surgical and antimicrobial approaches for prosthetic joint infections are described for first-line treatment of prosthetic joint infections and approaches in the event of treatment failure. Management approaches are based on an understanding of the role the biofilm plays in the pathogenesis of prosthetic joint infections. The management of these infections aims to fulfil two key goals: to eradicate the biofilm-associated microorganisms and, to maintain a functional joint and quality of life. In treatment failure, these goals are not always feasible, and the role of the multi-disciplinary team and shared-decision making are prominent.

Implications

Prosthetic joint surgery is a high-volume surgery, and the demand for this surgery is continually increasing. With this, the number of infections requiring expert care will also increase. Eminence-based management approaches have been established to guide treatment failure until knowledge gaps in optimal management are addressed by well-designed, clinical trials.

### The role of bacterial skin infections in atopic dermatitis: expert statement and review from the international eczema council skin infection group [^111UekoT]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Untreated bacterial skin infection in AD may become systemic and lead to life‐threatening complications including sepsis, endocarditis and bone and joint infections. 20, 21, 22 Despite the significant morbidity caused by bacterial skin infection in AD, there is a lack of consensus on how to define and treat associated bacterial colonization and infection. Although there are many diagnostic criteria for AD itself, there are no validated diagnostic criteria for infected AD. 23

The International Eczema Council, a group of approximately 100 experts in AD worldwide, has recently initiated a taskforce to define the role of bacterial skin infections and their management in AD through consensus statements in an effort to provide level D evidence. It is hoped that input from clinical experts will contribute to better defining the wide‐ranging clinical presentations of S. aureus infection in AD and, more importantly, to identify better those who may benefit from existing or novel antimicrobial treatments. Based on a systematic search of the literature, including terms for AD and 'infection', 'bacteria', 'staphylococcus aureus' and 'microbiome' (detailed search strategy available on request), this narrative review defines the clinical features of bacterial infection in AD and our current understanding of the host and bacterial factors that influence microbial colonization and virulence.

### The spectrum of infections in catheter-dependent hemodialysis patients [^115q79fx]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2011). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Catheter-dependent hemodialysis patients may develop access-related and nonaccess-related infections that may be managed in the outpatient arena or in the hospital. The goal of this study was to quantify infections in such patients, to characterize their clinical presentations, and to evaluate factors determining need for hospitalization.

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

We collected prospective data on the clinical management of catheter-dependent hemodialysis patients with suspected infection at a large dialysis center. We documented the presenting symptoms, type of infection, pathogen, and whether hospitalization occurred.

Results

An infection was suspected in 305 separate cases and confirmed in 88%. The 268 diagnosed infections included catheter-related bacteremia (69%), another access-related infection (19%), and nonaccess-related infection (12%). The overall frequency of infection was 4.62 per 1000 catheter-days. Hospitalization occurred in 37% of all infections, but it varied greatly (72% for nonaccess-related infection, 34% for catheter-related bacteremia, and 4% for exit-site infection). Among patients with catheter-related bacteremia, the likelihood of hospitalization varied by pathogen, being 53% for Staphylococcus aureus, 30% for Enterococcus, 23% for Staphylococcus epidermidis, and 17% for gram-negative rods (P < 0.001). The likelihood of hospitalization was not associated with age, gender, or diabetes. Fever was a presenting symptom in only 47% of cases of catheter-related bacteremia.

Conclusions

Catheter-dependent patients have a high burden of infection. It is important to evaluate patients with suspected infection for various access-related and nonaccess-related infections. A low threshold is indicated for suspecting catheter-related bacteremia because the patients frequently present without fever.

### Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia: epidemiology, pathophysiology, and management strategies [^113aCp4v]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Staphylococcus aureus is a major cause of bacteremia, and S. aureus bacteremia is associated with higher morbidity and mortality, compared with bacteremia caused by other pathogens. The burden of S. aureus bacteremia, particularly methicillin-resistant S. aureus bacteremia, in terms of cost and resource use is high. The risk of infective endocarditis and of seeding to other metastatic foci increases the risk of mortality and raises the stakes for early, appropriate treatment. The incidence of S. aureus bacteremia and its complications has increased sharply in recent years because of the increased frequency of invasive procedures, increased numbers of immunocompromised patients, and increased resistance of S. aureus strains to available antibiotics. This changing epidemiology of S. aureus bacteremia, in combination with the inherent virulence of the pathogen, is driving an urgent need for improved strategies and better antibiotics to prevent and treat S. aureus bacteremia and its complications.

### Redefining Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia: a structured approach guiding diagnostic and therapeutic management [^112cyjU2]. The Journal of Infection (2023). Medium credibility.

Need for a new classification

Clinicians need a classification for SAB that directs the diagnostic work-up and individualizes antibiotic treatment (Fig. 1). This framework can also be used to identify knowledge gaps for future research (Table 1). This proposed classification system begins after the initial positive blood culture with a requisite evaluation for every patient with SAB, including physical examination, repeat blood cultures, and echocardiography. Risk stratification based upon these results could then define patients at high or low risk of metastatic infection. Patients identified as high risk for complications could then undergo a more extensive diagnostic work-up to find or exclude these complications, in contrast to the patient without risk factors present at baseline or with negative results from the initial work-up ('low-risk SAB'). Ideally, the result of the more in-depth diagnostic work-up would delineate the extent and nature of the patient's S. aureus infection. This 'final clinical diagnosis', and not a designation of complicated SAB solely on the basis of the presence of factors that are associated with metastatic infections, would correspond with a certain treatment strategy for the average patients with this clinical picture, including route of administration, duration, and load reduction. The last step is to establish the final treatment plan for the individual patient by further streamlining or changing duration of the treatment based on clinical factors. Of course, for this classification to work in clinical decision making, it must be able to accurately identify the absence of metastatic infections in patients with SAB, even when traditional evaluations fail to identify one.

### Advances in the medical management of skin and soft tissue infections [^115csuj1]. BMJ (2016). Excellent credibility.

Skin and soft tissue infections are some of the most common infectious disease diagnoses in both inpatient and outpatient settings. With bacterial resistance to antimicrobials growing, decision making on empiric antibiotics is becoming increasingly difficult. Additionally, the most recent guidance from a professional society on the treatment of skin and soft tissue infections was published in 2014 by the Infectious Diseases Society of America and is now two years old. New antimicrobial agents have been developed and approved for the treatment of skin and soft tissue infections since then, and more are in the pipeline. This review summarizes the evidence on treatments that are new or in development and the potential repurposing of old antimicrobials. The clinical utility of these treatments is also discussed.

### Orbital cellulitis management in pediatric and adult cohorts: a 12-year retrospective analysis from a tertiary center [^1161RWuo]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Orbital cellulitis (OC) is a vision-threatening infection requiring prompt medical and/or surgical intervention. This study evaluates clinical features, management outcomes, and predictors of surgical necessity in pediatric and adult OC patients.

Methods

Retrospective analysis of 40 OC patients (13 pediatric, 27 adult, ages: 34.8 ± 23.9 y) at Xi'an Fourth Hospital (2011–2023). The data collected and analyzed retrospectively including demographics, signs and symptoms, concomitant diagnoses, inpatient management, imaging results, surgical culture results, visual acuity at presentation and last follow-up, duration of intravenous antibiotic treatment, and sequelae of disease were collected.

Results

Surgery was required in 84.6% (11/13) of pediatric and 88.9% (24/27) of adult patients. Staphylococcus aureus (17.1%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (11.4%), and MRSA (8.6%) predominated in cultures; 31.4% showed no growth. Ceftriaxone (45%) and cefotaxime (7.5%) were primary antibiotics. Surgical intervention significantly increased hospital costs (¥13,317 ± ¥5351 versus ¥1843 ± ¥509; P < 0.0001) but improved adult visual acuity (VA) from 0.5 ± 0.3 to 0.6 ± 0.4 (P = 0.04). All patients achieved symptom resolution.

Conclusion

OC necessitates surgery in > 80% of cases regardless of age, driven by abscess formation or medical failure. Staphylococcal species (including MRSA) are key pathogens, warranting tailored empiric therapy. Cost-effective management algorithms integrating Chandler staging and vaccine history are recommended.

### Management of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia [^113Aray5]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia and endocarditis are serious infections that demand prompt clinical attention to ensure good outcomes. Of foremost importance is identifying and managing the source of infection and any associated complications. Evaluation for the presence of cardiac involvement is essential because inadequately managed S. aureus endocarditis is life threatening. Thus, physicians must aggressively negotiate treatment paths, considering whether the S. aureus bacteremia is complicated, whether foreign sources of infection should be removed or replaced, and whether surgical intervention is necessary. Selection of an antibiotic treatment is also an essential factor for optimal management. The increasing prevalence of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) infections has created a tremendous demand for effective and safe antimicrobial agents other than the historic anti-MRSA agent vancomycin.

Surgical site infections (SSIs) after operations — initial management and when to use antibiotics — are outlined as follows: surveillance standards mandate 30 days of follow-up for operations without placement of prosthetic material and for 1 year for operations where a prosthesis was inserted; the most important therapy for an SSI is to open the incision, evacuate the infected material, and continue dressing changes until the wound heals by secondary intention; if there is < 5 cm of erythema and induration with minimal systemic signs (temperature < 38.5°C, white blood cell (WBC) count < 12 000 cells/μL, and pulse < 100 beats/minute), antibiotics are unnecessary; patients with temperature > 38.5°C or heart rate > 110 beats/minute or erythema extending beyond the wound margins for > 5 cm may require a short course (eg, 24–48 hours) of antibiotics and opening of the suture line; for intestinal or female genital tract operations with mixed flora, antibiotics considered suitable for treatment of intra-abdominal infection are appropriate, and when MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) risk is present the initial antibiotic should include vancomycin, linezolid, daptomycin, telavancin, or ceftaroline plus piperacillin-tazobactam, a carbapenem, or ceftriaxone and metronidazole for gram-negative and anaerobic coverage; for incision and drainage of superficial abscesses, prophylactic antibiotics are not recommended.

### Incidence, prevalence, and management of MRSA bacteremia across patient populations-a review of recent developments in MRSA management and treatment [^115nMZR7]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Antimicrobial resistance is a major global health concern, and, of the Gram-positive bacteria, drug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus is a serious threat. S. aureus causes a wide range of infections commonly involving the skin, soft tissue, bone, joints, and infections associated with indwelling catheters or prosthetic devices. In addition, S. aureus is a leading cause of bacteremia in industrialized nations. Although methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) bacteremia incidence has decreased over the past decade, MRSA remains associated with poorer clinical outcomes compared with methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA). S. aureus bacteremia (SAB) often causes metastatic infections such as infective endocarditis (IE), septic arthritis, and osteomyelitis. Moreover, SAB can lead to complications such as sepsis and septic shock. Taken together, these issues make SAB particularly challenging to treat.

Choice and timing of antibacterial therapy greatly affect treatment outcomes in SAB. For SAB caused by MSSA, β-lactam therapy is considered the gold standard. For MRSA, the 2011 Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines recommend treatment with vancomycin or daptomycin. However, each antimicrobial agent has limitations. Several issues restrict the utility of vancomycin, including slow bactericidal activity, low tissue penetration, and increasing reports of resistance and failure. While daptomycin is effective against MRSA bacteremia, treatment-emergent nonsusceptibility is concerning, and evidence suggests prior vancomycin treatment may encourage daptomycin resistance in S. aureus. Given the substantial morbidity and mortality associated with SAB and the limitations of currently approved treatments, there is a need to identify alternative agents for the treatment of MRSA bacteremia. Time to effective treatment is largely dependent on pathogen identification. Delays in diagnosing and treating SAB lead to poorer clinical outcomes. Standard microbial identification techniques take between 48 and 72 h, while recently developed rapid diagnostic tests provide data within 3 h of collection. By enabling optimized antimicrobial therapy, rapid diagnostic tests may lower mortality, hospitalization, and costs. This review discusses the global incidence and prevalence, diagnostic methods, and current management strategies for SAB. We also briefly discuss another key part of MRSA infection management — prevention; however, an in depth discussion is beyond the scope of this review.

### Successful antibiotic management of Staphylococcus epidermidis endophthalmitis after implantable collamer lens implantation [^112qcRBR]. BMC Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

ICLs are ciliary sulcus placed anterior to the natural lens to treat myopia, correcting refractive error ranging from − 0.5D to -18D. It is an alternative, especially for patients with abnormal corneal topography and high myopia, and can provide better postoperative visual quality in patients with high myopia in the early postoperative period. Infectious endophthalmitis is one of the most vision-threatening complications post-ICL surgery. The rate of endophthalmitis post-ICL patients was approximately 1 in 6000(0.017%~0.036%). Cases of endophthalmitis caused by Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Cutibacterium acnes, postoperative have been reported, which required removal of the ICL during the treatment and replanted (Table 1). The signs and visual outcomes vary among different causative microorganism and onset of presentation. In acute postoperative endophthalmitis Streptococcus species and gram-negative organisms are more common, and in chronic postoperative endophthalmitis Cutibacterium acnes (formerly Propionibacterium acnes) are more common. Patients with acute endophthalmitis generally presented with poor initial acuities and visual outcomes than chronic endophthalmitis.

### Focus on the prophylaxis, epidemiology and therapy of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus surgical site infections and a position paper on associated risk factors: the perspective of an Italian group of surgeons [^116ZScCb]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Surgical site infections (SSIs) remain a major clinical problem in terms of morbidity, mortality, time spent in hospital and overall direct and indirect costs. Despite progress in their prevention, SSIs remain one of the most common adverse events in hospitals, accounting for 11% to 26% of all healthcare-associated infections. Surgical patients can develop several post-operative infections; wound infections, are common causes of post-operative morbidity and prolonged hospitalization. SSIs increase the total hospital bill by an additional 10–20%, lead to 80,000 deaths and are associated with an annual treatment cost of two billion US dollars. S. aureus SSIs can be life-threatening, being associated with a mortality rate of 5%, more than 2 extra weeks of time spent in hospital and around an extra cost of 50,000 US dollars.

Nearly 60% of SSIs are diagnosed after discharge from the hospital. This percentage is rising as the post-operative stay in hospital is getting shorter and the number of 1-day surgical procedures is increasing over time. The Diagnosis Related-Group (DRG) system underestimates the rate of SSIs because of the very early discharge of surgical patients. The exact incidence of SSIs is, therefore, difficult to determine. According to current literature, active SSI surveillance is useful in reducing the incidence of SSIs by surveillance-induced infection control efforts. When any prosthesis is implanted into the body during general surgery, cardiac surgery, orthopaedics, etc. beside S. aureus, Coagulase-negative Staphylococci, especially S. epidermidis, may be the cause of severe infections that can necessitate removal of the prosthesis.

Classification of surgical site infections

The identification of SSIs involves interpretation of clinical and laboratory findings. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance system has developed standardized surveillance criteria for defining SSIs. According to these criteria, SSIs are classified as being either incisional or organ/space. Incisional SSIs are further divided into those involving only skin and subcutaneous tissue (superficial incisional SSIs) and those involving deeper soft tissues of the incision (deep incisional SSIs).

### Validation of the proposed definition for complicated coagulase-negative staphylococcal bacteremia [^117XVY6j]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Moreover, the presence of implanted devices in the absence of clinical or radiological signs of infection should not automatically be considered a criterion for complicated disease. In our cohort, for patients where device infection was excluded and treated with a short course of antimicrobial therapy (< 14 days), none experienced device-related infections within the 120 days.

S. epidermidis was the predominant species, limiting the ability to fully assess the impact on mortality of other species, including S. lugdunensis. As expected, S. lugdunensis was more prevalent among episodes with complicated diseases and showed a higher 30-day mortality compared to other species but this difference was not statistically significant. This finding is consistent with the study by Yukawa et al, which also reported a numerically higher 30-day mortality for S. lugdunensis bacteremia (15%) compared to S. epidermidis (8%), though the difference was not statistically significant because of the small sample size. The increased rates of complicated disease and mortality observed with S. lugdunensis may be due to its greater number of virulence factors that enhance its pathogenicity compared to other CoNS species. However, S. lugdunensis lacks key virulence factors characteristic of S. aureus, such as coagulase.

This study has several limitations. First, it is a retrospective, single-center study conducted at a tertiary hospital, which tends to manage more complex cases; furthermore, we used patients from the cohort of suspected IE, potentially leading to an overrepresentation of cases at high risk for IE. Consequently, our findings may not fully represent the epidemiology of CoNS bacteremia in nontertiary care settings. Second, numerous confounding factors can influence decisions regarding early source control interventions, including care-limiting decisions or withdrawal of care, potentially introducing survivorship bias. However, no patient died within 48 hours from bacteremia onset, and only 2 were considered for withdrawal of care within the same timeframe.

Our study highlights the importance of a comprehensive approach to managing CoNS bacteremia, which includes early interventions such as ID consultation, tailored antimicrobial therapy, and timely source control measures when indicated. The proposed definition for complicated CoNS bacteremia failed to identify patients at higher risk for mortality in our cohort. Further studies are needed to refine the definition and improve its ability to identify patients with an elevated risk of poor outcomes.

Regarding medical management for infective endocarditis, more specifically with respect to antibiotic therapy, coagulase-negative staphylococci, AHA 2015 guidelines recommend to consider administering an aminoglycoside (to which the isolate is susceptible) if coagulase-negative staphylococci are resistant to gentamicin. Consider administering a fluoroquinolone (to which the isolate is susceptible) if coagulase-negative staphylococci are resistant to all aminoglycosides.

### Are coagulase-negative staphylococci virulent? [^111HmyTw]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Progress in contemporary medicine is associated with an increasing number of immunocompromised individuals. In this vulnerable group, the underlying disease together with long-term hospitalization and the use of medical devices facilitate infections by opportunistic pathogens, of which coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) represent a prime example.

Objectives

The diversity of CoNS with species- and strain-specific differences concerning virulence and clinical impact is highlighted. A focus is on the ability of CoNS to generate biofilms on biotic and abiotic surfaces, which enables skin and mucosa colonization as well as establishment of CoNS on indwelling foreign bodies.

Sources

Literature about the virulence of CoNS listed in PubMed was reviewed.

Content

Most catheter-related and prosthetic joint infections as well as most other device-related infections are caused by CoNS, specifically by Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus haemolyticus. A common theme of CoNS infections is a high antibiotic resistance rate, which often limits treatment options and contributes to the significant health and economic burden imposed by CoNS.

Implications

Breaching the skin barrier along with the insertion of medical devices offers CoNS opportunities to gain access to host tissues and to sustain there by forming biofilms on foreign body surfaces. Biofilms represent the perfect niche to protect CoNS from both the host immune response and the action of antibiotics. Their particular lifestyle, combined with conditions that facilitate host colonization and infection, has led to the growing impact of CoNS as pathogens. Moreover, CoNS may serve as hidden reservoirs for antibiotic resistance and virulence traits.

### Successful antibiotic management of Staphylococcus epidermidis endophthalmitis after implantable collamer lens implantation [^115nKL9b]. BMC Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Posterior chamber phakic implantable collamer lens (ICL) implantation was effective and safe for the correction of myopia. Infectious endophthalmitis after intraocular surgery is a rare vision-threatening complication. According to the Endophthalmitis Vitrectomy Study, the categories of postoperative infectious endophthalmitis can be divided into acute (occurring within 6 weeks after surgery) or chronic (occurring 6 weeks after surgery). The vitreous tap of most acute cases is confirmed to be Staphylococcus epidermidis and other organisms including gram-negative species. Post-ICL endophthalmitis has been reported previously. However, we reported the first successful medical treatment of Staphylococcus epidermidis endophthalmitis without ICL explantation and vitrectomy in the V4c model.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^114qTzei]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Cellulitis and erysipelas (evidence summary) — microbiology and diagnostic yields — are described as diffuse, superficial, spreading skin infections and are not the correct term when pus collections are present; culture-based diagnosis often has low yield and streptococci predominate while Staphylococcus aureus is less frequent. Blood cultures are generally positive in < 5% of cases, cultures of needle aspirations yield 5% to approximately 40%, and punch biopsy cultures yield an organism in 20%–30% of cases with the concentration of bacteria in the tissues usually quite low; combined culture, serology, and tissue methods suggest the vast majority arise from streptococci (often group A but also B, C, F, or G), and Staphylococcus aureus cases are typically linked to an open wound or previous penetrating trauma including bites or illicit drug injection; methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is an unusual cause of typical cellulitis.

### Prosthetic patch infection after carotid endarterectomy [^115m2k48]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

Objectives and Design

prospective audit of the management and outcome of prosthetic patch infection after carotid endarterectomy (CEA) at Leicester Royal Infirmary plus review of the literature.

Results

8/936 CEA patients (0.85%) developed a prosthetic patch infection. Responsible organisms included MRSA (n = 3), Staphylococcus epidermidis(n = 2), haemolytic Streptococcus (n = 1), Staphylococcus aureus(n = 1) and Pseudomonas (n = 1). Early wound complications preceded 4/5 infections presenting within 9 weeks of surgery. In addition to systemic antibiotics and debridement, management included patch removal and: (i) carotid ligation (n = 3), vein patch repair (n = 1), vein bypass (n = 3). One patient had antibiotic irrigation of the in-situpatch. No patient died, one suffered a disabling postoperative stroke and two had temporary cranial nerve injuries. Including this series, a literature review identified 43 prosthetic patch infections, 91% culturing Staphylococci or Streptococci. Cumulative freedom from perioperative stroke/death or re-infection was 65% at 2 years. Patients treated by patch excision and autologous venous reconstruction had the best outcome with a cumulative freedom from perioperative stroke/death or re-infection of 91% at 2 years.

Conclusion

prosthetic patch infection after CEA is rare. This study emphasises the importance of close surveillance of early wound complications. Surgical decision-making, especially the safety of carotid ligation, was facilitated by access to transcranial Doppler.

Periprosthetic joint infections (PJIs) are a devastating complication of joint arthroplasty surgeries that are often complicated by biofilm formation. The development of biofilms makes PJI treatment challenging as they create a barrier against antibiotics and host immune responses. This review article provides an overview of the current understanding of biofilm formation, factors that contribute to their production, and the most common organisms involved in this process. This article focuses on the identification of biofilms, as well as current methodologies and emerging therapies in the management of biofilms in PJI.

Management of SSTIs — purulent infection (furuncle/carbuncle/abscess): For mild infection, "incision and drainage is indicated". Moderate infection involves incision and drainage (I & D) and culture and sensitivity (C & S) with empiric "TMP/SMX or Doxycycline", then defined treatment as "MRSA — TMP/SMX" and "MSSA — Dicloxacillin or Cephalexin". Severe infection involves I & D and C & S with empiric "Vancomycin or Daptomycin or Linezolid or Telavancin or Ceftaroline" and defined treatment as "MRSA — See Empiric" and "MSSA — Nafcillin or Cefazolin or Clindamycin". Since "daptomycin and telavancin are not approved for use in children, vancomycin is recommended; clindamycin may be used".

### Guide to utilization of the microbiology laboratory for diagnosis of infectious diseases: 2024 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the American Society for Microbiology (ASM) [^115B1hm3]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Periprosthetic joint infection — organisms and preoperative evaluation are described as follows: Staphylococci, including not just S. aureus but also coagulase-negative staphylococci, especially Staphylococcus epidermidis, are particularly common causes alongside streptococci, enterococci, aerobic Gram-negative bacilli, anaerobic bacteria (eg, Cutibacterium acnes, Finegoldia magna) and fungi, with C. acnes particularly common in shoulder arthroplasty infection; diagnosis and microbiology definition is ideally made pre-operatively, but if not possible, should be pursued at revision or resection arthroplasty; preoperatively, ESR and CRP are recommended (some also use D-dimer), as is arthrocentesis for synovial fluid cell count and differential and culture.

### AABIP evidence-informed guidelines and expert panel report for the management of indwelling pleural catheters [^115Ruje8]. Journal of Bronchology & Interventional Pulmonology (2020). High credibility.

AABIP IPC catheter removal for catheter-related pleural space infection — In patients with IPCs for the management of known or suspected MPEs who develop a catheter-related pleural space infection, we suggest catheter removal and drainage of the pleural space with a new chest tube should be considered if any of the following are present: a tunnel tract infection, poor catheter drainage despite the use of fibrinolytics and DNase, or persistent sepsis despite antibiotics and drainage through the original IPC (Ungraded Consensus-Based Statement). Given the lack of direct evidence and the overall low mortality associated with IPC-related pleural space infections, one might consider a trial of antibiotics without IPC removal, with the understanding that in the setting of virulent organisms failure rates are likely high, although one exception is the presence of coagulase-negative staphylococcal infection, for which high rates of catheter salvage have been reported. When there is failure to respond to treatment, suggested by either poor clinical response or inadequate IPC drainage, this should prompt catheter removal, and placement of a new chest tube for continued drainage is also suggested in the setting of persistent fluid after IPC removal.

### The utility of risk factors to define complicated Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia in a setting with low methicillin-resistant S. aureus prevalence [^111apNHF]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

Risk factors have low to moderate predictive value to identify complicated SAB. Using risk factors to define complicated SAB, as recommended by IDSA guidelines, may increase the proportion of patients with complicated SAB by 20%. Because classification is used to guide the duration of antibiotic treatment, this will inadvertently lead to unnecessary prolonged antibiotic use. These findings illustrate that in patients with SAB, better criteria, in addition to reliable additional diagnostic procedures, are needed to optimize clinical management.

### Outpatient management of pediatric oncology patients with low-risk fever and neutropenia: implementation of new clinical practice guideline at Texas children's hospital… [^116uuUaf]. ASCO (2017). Low credibility.

Abstract 26 Background: Traditionally, pediatric oncology patients with fever and severe neutropenia are admitted on empiric intravenous antibiotics pending blood cultures, fever resolution, and a rising ANC. Based on significant evidence that risk-stratification of these patients with fever and neutropenia and outpatient management of "low-risk" FN patients with oral antibiotics can be safe and effective, we implemented an institutional clinical practice guideline to provide outpatient care for children with LRFN. Methods: A validated "Alexander" clinical decision rule was adopted to risk stratify pediatric oncology patients with FN. A new CPG was formulated for the outpatient management of LRFN patients, with either discharge on presentation or at 24–48 hours after admission, with levofloxacin and close follow-up.

All stakeholders were educated regarding the new guidelines and process prior to implementation, and the guidelines were approved by the institutional Evidence Based Outcomes Center. Results: In 9 months since guideline implementation, 10/11 of the eligible patients have been managed outpatient for LRFN. Seven patients were discharged home from the ER or oncology clinic. Three patients were discharged early at 24–48 hours after admission. Outpatient management was safe, and all but one patient had resolution of fever within 48 hours and negative blood cultures. One patient had a positive blood culture with Staphylococcus epidermidis and was admitted for IV antibiotics with no complications. Parents of 9/10 patients responded to surveys. All 9 families found outpatient management to be a good experience, follow-up easy, and reported no adverse effects with levofloxacin.

One family preferred inpatient care due to anxiety, while importantly 8/9 parents said they preferred outpatient care compared to inpatient observation.

During the treatment of an infection, bacterial. cells inside biofilms may be exposed to sublethal concentrations of the antimicrobial agents. In the present study, the effect of subinhibitory concentrations of tigecycline on biofilms formed by S. epidermidis RP62A was investigated using a quantitative global proteomic technique. As.

icaD), extracellular matrix binding protein, accumulation- associated protein, and biofilm-associated protein homolog are involved in biofilm formation of S. epidermidis. Bacteria within biofilms can be protected from host immune defenses and antibiotic therapies. found that PIA genes were upregulated following treatment with sublethal antibiotics; however, they were not correlated with increased biofilm production. In addition, sublethal nafcillin and linezolid have influenced the expression of some virulence factors. This activity can lead to bacterial. Materials and Methods Bacterial strain and growth conditions S. epidermidis strain RP62A was adjusted to an optical density at 600 nm of 0. 1 and grown with TSBg with 1/8, 1/4. living cells in S. epidermidis strain RP62A biofilms decreased, but the biofilm densities varied.

In addition, we found the global proteome response in strain RP62A biofilms to be dependent on TC concentration, with differential expression of diverse functional groups of.
