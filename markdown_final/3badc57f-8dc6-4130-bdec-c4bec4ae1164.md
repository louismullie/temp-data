## Question

How much protein is + 1 in Urine analysis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what a urine dipstick result of 1+ protein corresponds to in quantitative terms and how to interpret it. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the semiquantitative grading scale for dipstick protein and confirm the concentration range for 1+. Then, I should verify how this translates to daily protein excretion and the limitations of that conversion. Next, I will review the diagnostic accuracy of a 1+ dipstick and when to confirm with quantitative testing. After that, I should consider special contexts like pregnancy, CKD, and diabetes. Finally, I will synthesize a practical interpretation and next steps for care.

> Let me first confirm the semiquantitative scale. A 1+ protein on urine dipstick generally corresponds to approximately 30 to less than 100 mg of protein per deciliter of urine, which is the conventional manufacturer-aligned range used in clinical practice and supported by pediatric nephrology guidance and contemporary cohort methodology [^115BTMaM] [^115x69LH].

> Wait, let me verify the quantitative implications before drawing conclusions. If I naively assume a urine output of about 1 liter per day, 1+ protein at 30–100 mg/dL would suggest roughly 300–1,000 mg per day; however, that assumes uniform concentration across the day and ignores diurnal and hydration-related variability, so I should not over-interpret that back-of-the-envelope estimate. The more reliable approach is to quantify with a spot protein-to-creatinine ratio or a 24-hour collection when confirmation is needed, because dipsticks reflect concentration rather than total excretion and are influenced by urine tonicity and timing [^1175ZuJn] [^116tVsFs].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about diagnostic meaning. I need to check the accuracy of a 1+ dipstick. In pregnancy, a 1+ dipstick has only modest sensitivity and specificity for significant proteinuria, with pooled positive likelihood ratio around 3.5 and negative likelihood ratio around 0.6, meaning both false positives and false negatives are common; guidelines therefore recommend confirming any 1+ result with a spot protein-to-creatinine ratio or albumin-to-creatinine ratio rather than relying on dipstick alone [^112TYp9C] [^117D9Xtv] [^112AeHE2].

> Let me consider the pregnancy context more carefully. Significant proteinuria in pregnancy is typically defined as at least 300 mg per 24 hours or a spot protein-to-creatinine ratio of at least 0.3, and many societies advise that a dipstick of 1+ should trigger confirmatory testing rather than be used to diagnose preeclampsia; some guidelines even allow 2+ as a proxy only when confirmatory testing is unavailable, underscoring that 1+ is insufficiently specific for diagnosis [^1139UXZ9] [^112AeHE2] [^115T8kg3].

> I should double-check the broader CKD context. For chronic kidney disease evaluation, KDIGO recommends confirming any positive dipstick with a laboratory ACR or PCR, ideally on a first-morning sample, because dipsticks are semiquantitative and susceptible to false positives and negatives; relying on a 1+ dipstick alone risks misclassification and inappropriate management decisions [^1175ZuJn] [^116DFttY].

> But wait, what if the patient has diabetes or is being screened for microalbuminuria. I need to ensure I am using the right marker. Dipsticks are relatively insensitive for low-level albuminuria, so guidelines favor ACR for detection and monitoring; a 1+ dipstick may miss clinically important albuminuria, and conversely may be positive in concentrated urine without true pathology, so confirmation with ACR is essential [^1175ZuJn] [^113YWT6t].

> Let me synthesize the clinical interpretation. A 1+ protein on dipstick corresponds to about 30–100 mg/dL of urinary protein concentration, which is mild proteinuria but not diagnostic by itself; given the limited accuracy of dipsticks, I should confirm with a spot protein-to-creatinine ratio or albumin-to-creatinine ratio, and if the clinical stakes are high or results are discordant, proceed to a 24-hour collection to quantify total protein excretion before making management decisions [^115BTMaM] [^1175ZuJn] [^117ErQGq].

> Next, I should review practical next steps. If the clinical pretest probability is low, a negative or low spot PCR or ACR can reasonably exclude significant proteinuria; if the spot test is positive, repeating with a first-morning sample improves reliability, and a 24-hour collection remains the reference standard when precise quantification will change management, such as in pregnancy, glomerular disease, or before immunosuppression [^116a6eU2] [^117ErQGq] [^114ZHmzt].

Urine protein 1+ on dipstick corresponds to **30–100 mg/dL** of protein in urine [^115BTMaM] [^115x69LH]. This is a **semiquantitative estimate** and should be confirmed with a spot urine protein-to-creatinine ratio (UPCR) or a 24-hour collection [^1175ZuJn] [^117D9Xtv], as dipsticks can give false positives/negatives due to urine concentration, pH, or non-albumin proteins [^117D9Xtv]. In pregnancy, 1+ proteinuria warrants **confirmatory testing** for preeclampsia [^113G9ta7] [^112AeHE2]; in CKD, it should prompt quantification and further evaluation [^1175ZuJn] [^116DFttY].

---

## Quantitative interpretation of 1+ proteinuria

The dipstick grading is **semiquantitative**, with 1+ approximating 30–100 mg/dL [^115BTMaM] [^115x69LH]. Because dipsticks detect albumin preferentially and are affected by urine concentration and pH, **confirmatory testing is required** [^1175ZuJn] [^117D9Xtv].

---

## Clinical significance of 1+ proteinuria

Clinical significance varies by context: in pregnancy, 1+ proteinuria may indicate **preeclampsia** and should be confirmed with UPCR or 24-hour urine [^113G9ta7] [^112AeHE2]; in CKD, it suggests kidney damage and should be quantified and monitored [^1175ZuJn] [^116DFttY]; in the general population, it may be transient or chronic and should be confirmed and tracked over time [^1175ZuJn] [^117XeZs7].

---

## Limitations and accuracy of dipstick testing

Dipstick testing has notable limitations:

- **False positives**: Alkaline urine, dehydration, exercise, infection, or non-albumin proteins [^117D9Xtv] [^1163GhiE].
- **False negatives**: Dilute urine or non-albumin proteinuria [^117D9Xtv] [^1163GhiE].
- **Accuracy**: Poor for low-level proteinuria; use UPCR or ACR for confirmation [^1175ZuJn] [^116DFttY].

---

## Recommended confirmatory tests

Confirmatory testing is **essential**:

| **Test** | **Description** | **Clinical utility** |
|-|-|-|
| UPCR | Spot urine protein/creatinine ratio | Convenient, widely used, correlates with 24-hour protein [^116WnUKT] [^112EGcB6] |
| UACR | Spot urine albumin/creatinine ratio | Sensitive for low-level albuminuria, preferred in diabetes/CKD [^114Riz3B] [^117ErQGq] |
| 24-hour urine collection | Gold standard for total protein excretion | Accurate but cumbersome; use when precise quantification is needed [^116qeBca] [^116oRh7U] |

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

- **Pregnancy**: Confirm 1+ proteinuria with UPCR or 24-hour urine; do not repeat once significant proteinuria is confirmed [^112fVC2m] [^115iXzYn].
- **CKD**: Confirm dipstick proteinuria with UPCR or ACR; monitor trends and adjust management accordingly [^1175ZuJn] [^116DFttY].
- **General population**: Confirm and monitor; persistent proteinuria warrants further evaluation [^1175ZuJn] [^113YWT6t].

---

## Clinical implications and management

Management depends on context: in pregnancy, confirm and monitor closely for preeclampsia; in CKD, quantify proteinuria, assess renal function, and treat underlying causes; in the general population, confirm, monitor, and evaluate for transient causes or chronic kidney disease [^1175ZuJn] [^116DFttY].

---

Urine protein 1+ on dipstick corresponds to **30–100 mg/dL** and should be confirmed with UPCR or 24-hour urine due to dipstick limitations [^115BTMaM] [^1175ZuJn]. Management is context-specific, with confirmation and monitoring guiding next steps [^116DFttY].

### Accuracy of urinalysis dipstick techniques in predicting significant proteinuria in pregnancy [^112TYp9C]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To estimate the accuracy of point-of-care dipstick urinalysis in predicting significant proteinuria in pregnancy.

Data Sources

Literature from 1970 to February 2002 was identified via 1). general bibliographic databases, that is, MEDLINE and EMBASE, 2). Cochrane Library and relevant specialist register of the Cochrane Collaboration, and 3). checking the reference lists of known primary and review articles.

Methods Of Study Selection

Studies were selected if the accuracy of dipstick urinalysis techniques in predicting total protein excretion was estimated compared with a reference standard (laboratory estimation of protein excretion). The tests included visually read color-change dipsticks and automated dipstick urinalysis. Study selection, quality assessment, and data abstraction were performed independently and in duplicate.

Tabulation, Integration, and Results

Data from selected studies were abstracted as 2 x 2 tables comparing the test result with the reference standard. Test accuracy was expressed as likelihood ratios. Summary likelihood ratios were generated as measures of diagnostic accuracy to determine posttest probabilities. The electronic search produced 1543 citations. After independent review of published articles, a total of 34 articles was obtained for further scrutiny, and 7 studies were considered eligible for inclusion in the review. The 6 studies evaluating visual dipstick urinalysis produced a pooled positive likelihood ratio of 3.48 (95% confidence interval 1.66, 7.27) and a pooled negative likelihood ratio of 0.6 (95% confidence interval 0.45, 0.8) for predicting 300 mg/24-hour proteinuria at the 1+ or greater threshold.

Conclusion

The accuracy of dipstick urinalysis with a 1+ threshold in the prediction of significant proteinuria is poor and therefore of limited usefulness to the clinician. Accuracy may be improved at higher thresholds (greater than 1+ proteinuria), but available data are sparse and of poor methodological quality. Therefore, it is not possible to make meaningful inferences about accuracy at higher urine dipstick thresholds. There is an urgent need for research in this area of common obstetric practice.

### Dipstick proteinuria: can it guide hypertension management? [^113UWHoL]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Recent guidelines call for lower blood pressure targets in patients with proteinuria of 1 g/d or greater. Dipstick test for proteinuria is widely available, but no information on its sensitivity or specificity is available when implementing current guidelines. To determine performance characteristics of dipstick proteinuria, we studied 332 patients attending a Veterans Administration renal clinic who underwent simultaneous measurement of urine protein and creatinine, as well as automated urinalysis with a dipstick graded from 0 to 4+ with a machine reader. There was increasing severity of proteinuria with each increment in dipstick result. When the spot urine protein-creatinine ratio was less than 1, a lower specific gravity was associated with greater severity of proteinuria. Areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve for 1 and 3 g protein/g creatinine were 0.945 and 0.905, respectively. This attests to the excellent performance of the urine dipstick. The likelihood of having a protein-creatinine ratio of 1 or greater was 7% when urine dipstick protein value was 1+ or 2+, 62% when dipstick protein value was 3+, and 92% when dipstick protein value was 4+. Thus, dipstick proteinuria assessed by an automated reader remains a useful test to predict the severity of proteinuria and can be used to guide therapy. A cutoff dipstick proteinuria value of 3+ has the best combination of sensitivity and specificity (96% and 87%, respectively) in predicting a protein-creatinine ratio of 1 or greater and a cutoff value of 4+ in predicting a protein-creatinine ratio of 3 or greater (sensitivity, 94%; specificity, 83%). These results suggest that patients with 3+ or greater proteinuria should not only trigger appropriate evaluation of proteinuria, but also have mean arterial pressures targeted to less than 92 mm Hg.

### Clinical practice guideline on pregnancy and renal disease [^117D9Xtv]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Guideline 4.1.3

We recommend quantification of proteinuria is undertaken by protein:creatinine ratio (uPCR) or albumin:creatinine ratio (uACR). Twenty-four hour urine collection for quantification of protein is not required (1B).

Rationale

Dipstick testing of urine with reagent strips to detect proteinuria preferentially detects albumin. False positives occur with dehydration, exercise, infection and alkaline urine. False negatives occur with dilute urine, and non-albumin proteinuria. A systematic review of seven prospective studies showed that the sensitivity and specificity of a dipstick result of ≥ 1+ protein for predicting abnormal proteinuria in pregnancy (> 300 mg/24 h) ranges from 47 to 86% and 39–95% respectively, leading to the conclusion that the accuracy of dipstick urinalysis with a 1+ threshold in the prediction of significant proteinuria is poor. However, automated dipstick urinalysis provides a more accurate screening test for the detection of proteinuria than visual testing in hypertensive pregnancies.

### 2018 ESC / ESH guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension [^115t1TDJ]. European Heart Journal (2018). Medium credibility.

ESC/ESH 2018 — investigation of hypertension in pregnancy recommends basic laboratory monitoring including urine analysis, blood count, haematocrit, liver enzymes, serum creatinine, and serum uric acid, noting that hyperuricaemia in hypertensive pregnancies identifies women at increased risk of adverse maternal and foetal outcomes. All pregnant women should be assessed for proteinuria in early pregnancy to detect pre-existing renal disease and, in the second half of pregnancy, to screen for pre-eclampsia; a dipstick test of ≥ 1+ should prompt evaluation of ACR in a single spot urine sample and a value < 30 mg/mmol can reliably rule out proteinuria in pregnancy. Among additional tests, a soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1:placental growth factor ratio of ≤ 38 can be used to exclude the development of pre-eclampsia in the next week when suspected clinically.

### Diagnosis, evaluation, and management of the hypertensive disorders of pregnancy: executive summary [^112fVC2m]. Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Canada (2014). Medium credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for preeclampsia, more specifically with respect to screening for proteinuria, SOGC 2014 guidelines recommend to obtain more definitive testing for proteinuria (by urinary protein:creatinine ratio or 24-hour urine collection) when there is a suspicion of preeclampsia, including: ≥ 1+ dipstick proteinuria in patients with hypertension and rising BP and in patients with normal BP but symptoms or signs suggestive of preeclampsia.

### A comparison of the utility of the urine dipstick and urine protein-to-creatinine ratio for predicting microalbuminuria in patients with non-diabetic lifestyle-related diseases-a comparison with diabetes [^116zQvZw]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

When the utility of a single dipstick evaluation was compared with that of the uPCR for detecting of uACR ≥ 30 mg/gCr, the uPCR was shown to be more useful, with a high sensitivity and NPV as well as an almost equivalent specificity and PPV.

It is recommended that microalbuminuria be diagnosed, even when a single uACR measurement is ≥ 30 mg/gCr, if another examination shows uACR ≥ 30 mg/gCr among 2 subsequent early-morning urine tests. Regarding the significance of the three-time dipstick measurement, if the CO of 1 measurement is trace proteinuria, 3 measurements are more useful than 1 measurement, with the CO of 3 measurements indicating sensitivity 55.5% and specificity 79.7% when trace or more proteinuria is shown even once out of 3 times. If the CO of microalbuminuria is set at trace or more proteinuria two out of three times or 1(+) or more proteinuria one out of three times, the sensitivity for detecting microalbuminuria is reduced in non-diabetic patients, and therefore when the dipstick test shows trace levels or higher proteinuria once, it is desirable to confirm the result by measuring either uPCR or uACR at that time.

### Measuring albuminuria or proteinuria: does one answer fit all? [^113bgsG9]. Kidney International (2023). Medium credibility.

Measurement of proteinuria is critical for diagnosing and monitoring kidney disease. A variety of measures are available to clinicians and can identify all urinary proteins (proteinuria) or urine albumin alone (albuminuria). Proteinuria and albuminuria can be measured in either a random urine sample or a timed urine collection (often over 24 hours). Although an international guideline advocates the use of the urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio for most purposes, this measure is not universally available worldwide and historically has been more costly than alternatives. In addition, there may be important differences in accuracy between the albumin-to-creatinine ratio and others based on magnitude of albuminuria, sex, and certain clinical contexts. In this mini review, we review recommendations from international guidelines and discuss specific contexts where the optimal measure of proteinuria is unclear and, in some situations, controversial. We discuss the evidence supporting current recommendations for choice of measure, including the clinical settings of glomerulonephritis, transplantation, and pregnancy. We also discuss how patient sex and cost may impact this decision.

### Proteinuria during pregnancy: definition, pathophysiology, methodology, and clinical significance [^116a6eU2]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). Medium credibility.

Qualitative and quantitative measurement of urine protein excretion is one of the most common tests performed during pregnancy. For more than 100 years, proteinuria was necessary for the diagnosis of preeclampsia, but recent guidelines recommend that proteinuria is sufficient but not necessary for the diagnosis. Still, in clinical practice, most patients with gestational hypertension will be diagnosed as having preeclampsia based on the presence of proteinuria. Although the reference standard for measuring urinary protein excretion is a 24-hour urine collection, spot urine protein-to-creatinine ratio is a reasonable "rule-out" test for proteinuria. Urine dipstick screening for proteinuria does not provide any clinical benefit and should not be used to diagnose proteinuria. The classic cutoff cited to define proteinuria during pregnancy is a value of > 300 mg/24 hours or a urine protein-to-creatinine ratio of at least 0.3. Using this cutoff, the rate of isolated proteinuria in pregnancy may reach 8%, whereas preeclampsia occurs among 3% to 8% of pregnancies. Although this threshold is widely accepted, its origin is not based on evidence on adverse pregnancy outcomes but rather on expert opinion and results of small studies. After reviewing the available data, the most important factor that influences maternal and neonatal outcome is the severity of blood pressures and presence of end organ damage, rather than the excess protein excretion. Because the management of gestational hypertension and preeclampsia without severe features is almost identical in frequency of surveillance and timing of delivery, the separation into 2 disorders is unnecessary. If the management of women with gestational hypertension with a positive assessment of proteinuria will not change, we believe that urine assessment for proteinuria is unnecessary in women who develop new-onset blood pressure at or after 20 weeks' gestation. Furthermore, we do not recommend repeated measurement of proteinuria for women with preeclampsia, the amount of proteinuria does not seem to be related to poor maternal and neonatal outcomes, and monitoring proteinuria may lead to unindicated preterm deliveries and related neonatal complications. Our current diagnosis of preeclampsia in women with chronic kidney disease may be based on a change in protein excretion, a baseline protein excretion evaluation is critical in certain conditions such as chronic hypertension, diabetes, and autoimmune or other renal disorders. The current definition of superimposed preeclampsia possesses a diagnostic dilemma, and it is unclear whether a change in the baseline proteinuria reflects another systemic disease such as preeclampsia or whether women with chronic disease such as chronic hypertension or diabetes will experience a different "normal" pattern of protein excretion during pregnancy. Finally, limited data are available regarding angiogenic and other biomarkers in women with chronic kidney disease as a potential aid in distinguishing the worsening of baseline chronic kidney disease and chronic hypertension from superimposed preeclampsia.

### Proteinuria is associated with an increased risk of sudden cardiac arrest in the young population [^115x69LH]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

For urine analysis, 10 cc of mid‐steam urine after 4 hours from the last voiding was obtained. Spot urine protein analysis was performed with the conventional dipstick method using PH indicator that shows urine protein level as either negative, trace (equivalent to 10–30 mg/dL), +1 (30–100 mg/dL), +2 (100–300 mg/dL), +3 (300–1000 mg/dL), or +4 (≥ 1000 mg/dL). Internal and external quality control measures were pursued in each institution that was monitored by Korean Association of Laboratory Quality Control. Participants who were detected with urine protein (≥ +1) at baseline were defined as having proteinuria, and those who were not detected with urine protein or detected with trace amounts were defined as having no proteinuria. Baseline demographic factors, lifestyle habits, anthropometric and laboratory markers and comorbidities were included as covariates. The coding strategy, outcome measurement, and variable definitions used in this study have been validated in our prior studies. The ICD‐10 codes used in this study are summarized in Table S1. Definitions of variables are provided in Table S2.

### How to measure proteinuria? [^114Riz3B]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To examine the use of urine total protein compared with albumin measurements to assess and monitor patients with chronic kidney disease.

Recent Findings

Urine albumin or total protein-to-creatinine ratio measurements on a single-voided specimen provide a convenient and reliable alternative to 24-h urine measurements. The majority of studies that inform current renoprotective strategies have relied upon urine total protein measurements. Urine albumin measurements are required to detect microalbuminuria. The proportion of urinary protein composed of albumin is variable and may depend on the underlying renal disease.

Summary

Urine protein-to-creatinine measurements should continue to be used for the assessment and monitoring of patients with nondiabetic chronic kidney disease. Urine albumin-to-creatinine measurements should be reserved for detecting microalbuminuria and monitoring patients with diabetic nephropathy. Further research is required to investigate the relationship between urine total protein and albumin in different renal diseases and to compare the prognostic significance of urine total protein with that of albumin.

### Urine protein: creatinine ratio vs 24-hour urine protein for proteinuria management: analysis from the phase 3 REFLECT study of lenvatinib vs sorafenib in hepatocellular carcinoma [^115B6VH2]. British Journal of Cancer (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The mechanism underlying VEGFR-inhibitor-associated proteinuria are unclear, but may involve thrombotic microangiopathy or impairment of podocyte function. However, proteinuria is a manageable adverse event that does not typically lead to clinically meaningful adverse outcomes if it is appropriately monitored and managed. The regression model of the UPCR versus 24-hour urine protein data suggests a strong and statistically significant correlation between the 2 measurements, and using a UPCR cut-off value of 2.4 to delineate between grade 2 and 3 proteinuria and the need for further testing would obviate the need for the more burdensome 24-hour urine collection for an estimated 74% of patients with urine protein dipstick results of ≥ 2+.

Introduction of UPCR into the guidelines for proteinuria management could be as follows and as described in Supplementary Table 2: urine dipstick testing would be performed as regularly scheduled. A 24-hour urine collection or an immediate spot UPCR test would be required in the case of: (1) first occurrence of ≥ 2+ proteinuria while on lenvatinib; (2) a subsequent increase in severity of urine dipstick proteinuria while on the same dose level; (3) when following a lenvatinib dose reduction, the urine protein dipstick result was ≥ 2+. In addition, a 24-hour urine collection should be initiated as soon as possible (within 72 h) when UPCR is ≥ 2.4 to verify the grade of proteinuria. After the proteinuria has improved to a lower grade, lenvatinib may be restarted at a reduced dose. By following these criteria, proteinuria can be safely managed, enabling optimisation of lenvatinib treatment while minimising inconvenience to patients. It should also be noted that, although this analysis was conducted in patients with HCC, this monitoring approach may potentially be useful in other tumour types treated with lenvatinib (e.g. differentiated thyroid cancer or renal cell carcinoma).

### Proteinuria, impaired kidney function, and adverse outcomes in people with coronary disease: analysis of a previously conducted randomised trial [^1143GtuL]. BMJ (2006). Excellent credibility.

Objectives

To determine whether data on proteinuria are useful for refining estimates of risk based on kidney function alone, and whether the results of kidney function tests can be a useful adjunct to data on proteinuria.

Design

Analysis of data from a randomised trial. Impaired kidney function was defined as low glomerular filtration rate (< 60 ml/min/1.73 m2) and proteinuria (≥ 1+ protein) on dipstick urinalysis.

Setting

Study of cholesterol and recurrent events: a randomised trial of pravastatin 40 mg daily versus placebo.

Participants

4098 men and women with previous myocardial infarction.

Main Outcome Measures

All cause mortality and cardiovascular events.

Results

371 participants died in nearly 60 months of follow-up. Compared with participants without proteinuria or impaired kidney function, patients with both characteristics were at high risk (hazard ratio 2.39, 95% confidence interval 1.72 to 3.30), and those with only proteinuria or only impaired kidney function were at intermediate risk (1.69, 1.32 to 2.16; 1.41, 1.12 to 1.79, respectively) of dying from any cause. The results were similar for cardiovascular outcomes, including new cases of heart failure, stroke, and coronary death or non-fatal myocardial infarction. A graded increase in the risk of all cause mortality was seen for severity of renal impairment and degree of proteinuria by dipstick.

Conclusions

The presence or absence of proteinuria on dipstick urinalysis may be used to refine estimates of risk based on kidney function alone.

### The significance of trace proteinuria [^112EcnHv]. American Journal of Nephrology (2003). Low credibility.

Background

The clinical significance of a trace protein reading on urinalysis is unclear, and such a result is often ignored by the clinician.

Methods

We examined 185 samples of urine with trace proteinuria by both Chemstrips and sulfosalicylic acid testing, and compared the results with those of urinary albumin and total protein concentrations.

Results

Taking for the purposes of this study an arbitrary upper limit of normal of 20 mg/l for albumin and 100 mg/l for total protein concentration, we found abnormal albumin excretion in 87% and abnormal total protein excretion in 88% of trace samples. In this study, a negative urinalysis for protein excluded microalbuminuria in 87% and proteinuria in 78% of cases.

Conclusion

Qualitative testing for protein by urinalysis has a high sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing or ruling out microalbuminuria. Trace proteinuria usually means microalbuminuria; negative proteinuria tends to rule it out.

### Proteinuria as a surrogate marker for renal outcome: are we there yet? [^1178FdnC]. Kidney International (2015). Low credibility.

Observational studies in glomerular diseases suggest that proteinuria reduction translates to improved outcomes. Because of a dearth of high-quality studies supporting this association, proteinuria is not universally recognized as a surrogate end point. Barbour et al. report on the longitudinal measure of proteinuria that best predicts hard renal outcomes. Their finding that time-varying proteinuria is the most reliable proteinuria metric is a necessary step in establishing proteinuria as a surrogate end point.

### Urine protein: creatinine ratio vs 24-hour urine protein for proteinuria management: analysis from the phase 3 REFLECT study of lenvatinib vs sorafenib in hepatocellular carcinoma [^115fpfvW]. British Journal of Cancer (2019). Medium credibility.

Materials and methods

Study design and patients

Details of the REFLECT study have been published previously. Briefly, REFLECT was an international, randomised, open-label, noninferiority study, which enroled 954 previously untreated patients with unresectable HCC from 154 sites in 20 countries throughout Asia-Pacific, European, and North American regions. Patients were randomised (1:1) to receive lenvatinib (n = 478) or sorafenib (n = 476).

End points and assessments

All patients underwent urine dipstick testing at each scheduled safety assessment visit (day 1 and day 15 of the first 2 cycles, then day 1 of each subsequent cycle). Within 72 h of a positive (≥ 2) proteinuria urine dipstick test during regular safety assessment visits, patients underwent standard-of-care 24-hour urine collection for total protein, performed either at the central or local site laboratories, as well as a UPCR test, performed at the central laboratory. 24-Hour urine collection was used to grade proteinuria according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.0 criteria (Supplementary Table 1). Patients with positive urine dipstick test underwent dipstick testing every 2 weeks until results were reduced to 1+ or negative for 3 consecutive months.

Statistical analyses

Paired data were analysed. Optimal UPCR cut-off values were identified using standard receiver operating characteristic methods to maximise the Youden index/statistics (sensitivity + specificity), with urine data dichotomised by CTCAE proteinuria grades (grade < 2 vs ≥ 2 and grade ≤ 2 vs 3). The correlation between 24-hour urine protein data (as continuous values) and UPCR was analysed using a regression model of log-transformed data. Also, the optimal UPCR cut-off value determining which patients should undergo further testing with 24-hour urine collection was calculated. Statistical analyses were performed using R statistical software.

### Prediction of pre-eclampsia: a protocol for systematic reviews of test accuracy [^111LoXeW]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2006). Low credibility.

Predictive tests (index tests)

Tests used for the prediction of pre-eclampsia will be prioritised on the basis of clinical relevance and after consultation with persons knowledgeable of NHS needs (we will consult particularly with the NHS Antenatal Sourcing Subgroup).

Reference standard

Pre-eclampsia, using a variety of definitions. Pre-eclampsia is defined as hypertension (≥ 140/90 mmHg) with proteinuria (total protein of ≥ 300 mg in a 24 hour urine collection, or ≥ 30 mg/dL in a single sample of urine, or ≥ 1+ on a dipstick) developing for the first time after 20 weeks gestation, with or without generalised oedema. For women with chronic hypertension, pre-eclampsia is defined as a sudden worsening of hypertension and/or proteinuria, or other signs and symptoms of pre-eclampsia after 20 weeks gestation. When authors do not provide details of how pre-eclampsia was verified, pre-eclampsia rates as reported will be accepted. At the stage of data-extraction, the extent that pre-eclampsia definition complies with recent consensus will be assessed. All studies that compare a test or strategy with a reference standard according to international standards or variations of the definition, in pregnant women will be included.

Subgroups

Severe pre-eclampsia is defined as hypertension (systolic blood pressure ≥ 160 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 110 mmHg) with proteinuria (total protein of ≥ 2.0 gram in a 24 hour urine collection, or ≥ 3+ on a dipstick). A distinction will be made between early onset (< 34 weeks gestation) and late onset (≥ 34 weeks gestation) pre-eclampsia.

### Evaluation of proteinuria redux [^115c2VDE]. Kidney International (2016). Low credibility.

All of the methods for quantitative evaluation of proteinuria (or albuminuria) suffer from some methodological flaw. A new modification that improves the accuracy of the urine protein-to-creatinine ratios for predicting 24-hour urinary protein excretion has been examined in a well-characterized cohort of patients with glomerular disease. This approach needs to be systematically compared with other techniques before it can be universally recommended to replace the time-honored 24-hour urine collection.

Asymptomatic hypertension — urine dipstick screening for acutely elevated serum creatinine: In a prospective observational study, 143 patients with diastolic blood pressure ≥ 115 mm Hg were evaluated with serum creatinine and a urine dipstick, and of 143 patients, 24 met criteria for acutely elevated serum creatinine (> 1.2 or acute elevation > 25% above baseline). The presence of either hematuria or proteinuria on dipstick identified these patients with 100% sensitivity and 29.7% specificity, and specificity rose to 42.4% when an abnormal dipstick was defined as hematuria or ≥ 1+ proteinuria; reported 95% CI 83% to 100%.

### Detection and measurement of urinary protein [^116qeBca]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The measurement of urine total protein and albumin is central to the diagnosis and management of subjects with kidney disease and in assessing cardiovascular risk. Accurate assessment is vital to enable detection and management of the patient with proteinuria.

Recent Findings

The spot urine protein has been suggested as an acceptable alternative to 24-h urine collections. Recent studies suggest that this holds true for screening to exclude significant proteinuria (> 1 g/day) but data are lacking for the quantification of proteinuria and in assessing response to therapy. For albuminuria, while 24-h urinary albumin excretion remains the gold standard, spot urine samples are appropriate for screening. The optimal technique for the laboratory determination of urinary albumin has been questioned with the high-performance liquid chromatography-based method demonstrating significantly more albumin in the urine. Population-based studies have found dramatic increases in the prevalence of microalbuminuria with the new high-performance liquid chromatography assay. Whether this extra immunounreactive albumin detected by high-performance liquid chromatography is clinically important remains to be established.

Summary

Twenty-four-hour urine collection remains the gold standard for the accurate determination of both total urinary protein and albumin. Spot urine samples can be used for screening patients for albuminuria and proteinuria. The optimal method for measuring urinary albumin concentration remains to be established.

### Diagnostic accuracy of spot urinary protein and albumin to creatinine ratios for detection of significant proteinuria or adverse pregnancy outcome in patients with suspected pre-eclampsia: systematic review and meta-analysis [^1126ZMbV]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Clinical application

When considering the most appropriate diagnostic threshold for a test in practice, one must consider the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity that relates to threshold. What is acceptable in clinical practice will be determined by the place of the test in the management pathway (such as add-on, triage, or replacement) and the nature of the disease. When considering pre-eclampsia, one would wish a replacement test (stand alone) to limit the number of false negative results, as these women run the risk of developing undetected pre-eclampsia with a risk of serious morbidity and mortality. Women with false positive results will be subjected to increased monitoring and possibly pre-term delivery. Thus, protein to creatinine ratio as a replacement test would ideally use a threshold that maximises sensitivity and specificity. If protein to creatinine ratio were to be used as a triage test, with patients who test positive going on to have a 24 hour urine collection to verify the significant proteinuria, then false negatives need to be minimised but false positives will be identified by the second test, so sensitivity can be maximised at the expense of specificity. Our results can be used to determine the most appropriate threshold for each of these situations.

The findings from the multivariate meta-analysis relate to the accuracy of protein to creatinine ratio at the summary level (that is, averaged across all studies). Considerable heterogeneity exists at any threshold for which two or more studies provide evidence, so the performance of protein to creatinine ratio in an individual study setting may be somewhat different from the summary results presented here. Further research needs to identify the causes of heterogeneity in test accuracy across studies (for example, method of measurement, inaccurate reference standards) and identify those circumstances in which protein to creatinine ratio performs consistently well.

Prevalence of proteinuria also varied considerably across studies and has a big effect on how a protein to creatinine ratio test could be used. Following the protein to creatinine test, high positive and negative predictive values above 0.85 are achieved when the prevalence is high (for example, 0.8; see appendix E). However, when the prevalence is low (for example, 0.2; see appendix C), the negative predictive value remains above 0.85 but positive predictive value is then around 0.4. Thus a negative protein to creatinine ratio remains a good test for ruling out significant proteinuria, but positive tests results may have a high rate of false positives in this low prevalence population. Clinicians thus need to know the prevalence of significant proteinuria in the population and setting under investigation to allow accurate interpretation of the test results

### Impact of rural versus urban setting on kidney markers: a cross-sectional study in south-kivu, DRCongo [^1163GhiE]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

As part of our population-based study, we here assessed the influence of rural versus urban location on the level and interpretation of kidney markers. We found an overall prevalence of dipstick proteinuria (≥ 1+) of 9.6%, much higher in the rural (13.1%) than in the urban (4.8%) site. Interestingly, the overall prevalence of significant (A2 or A3) albuminuria was 6.6% and did not differ by site; thus, additional factors must explain the difference observed in dipstick proteinuria between rural and urban subjects. Physical activity, urinary concentration, diet, and urinary pH have previously been associated with the prevalence of dipstick proteinuria.

In this study, we found that the frequency of dipstick proteinuria increased when urine was more alkaline (pH ≥ 7.5). Interestingly, after adjustment for age, site, sex and other risk factors, alkaline urine remained independently associated with dipstick proteinuria. Testing for protein by dipstick is based on the protein error of indicators principle. In fact, the reagent area of urine dipstick is impregnated with tetrabromophenol blue indicator buffered to pH 3.0. In the presence of protein (albumin), there is ionization of the indicator (and hence pH) that leads to a change in color from yellow to green, then blue, depending upon the concentration. Thus, alkaline urine may give a false positive result with the reagent strip. However, these interferences are mostly described in vitro, with pH values outside the physiological range. Interestingly certain dietary features are known to be associated with urine pH, in particular a vegetarian diet less enriched in amino acids is associated with alkaline urine, whereas a western diet, typically high in proteins (the most common dietary source of amino acids) is typically associated with acidic urine. Admittedly, we did not collect information about the type of diet of participants, yet the high burden of childhood malnutrition observed in rural areas of DRC is in line with an overall low-protein intake in rural settings. In both sites, dipstick proteinuria was associated with diluted urine at least as assessed by urine specific gravity a finding contrasting with published evidence. However, it should be noted that urine specific gravity is unreliable and much less accurate than osmolality to assess the urine concentration status. Furthermore, a low urine specific gravity may be indicated by urine dipstick tests if the urine is alkaline. Thus, the interpretation of the apparent impact of specific gravity on dipstick positivity remains complex and this further underlines the limitations of the dipstick. Fortunately, in this study, we also measured ACR, which is much less biased by urine hydration status. We confirmed, as shown in previous studies conducted outside SSA, that the proteinuria dipstick is inaccurate in detecting albuminuria A2 or A3. For example, 84.6% of subjects with A2 or 69.2% with A3 had negative urine dipstick results (false-negative ≥ 1+). In addition, proteinuria dipstick tests had very poor overall sensitivity (< 50%) for the detection of A2 or A3 in both sites. The low accuracy could be partly explained by the fact that this study was conducted in the general population rather than high-risk subjects, resulting in a low prevalence of proteinuria. Another interesting finding is that the determinants of proteinuria dipstick (≥ 1+) and those of albuminuria (A3) were very distinct. In particular, albuminuria, but not a positive dipstick proteinuria, was significantly associated with diabetes, another reminder of the poor diagnostic value of dipstick. Thus, despite the obvious benefits of proteinuria dipsticks (quick, cheap, and easy) in epidemiologic studies in SSA, researchers need to be aware of its limitations. Nevertheless, it is worth emphasizing that over 70% of recent general population studies of CKD in SSA still relied on proteinuria dipstick as urinary parameter. Finally, we compared the body composition profile of rural and urban participants, and its influence on eGFR markers. Rural participants had higher skeletal muscle mass, whereas urban residents had higher fat mass, suggesting more physical activity in rural (mostly farmers) participants and/or higher caloric intake in urban participants. The metabolic profile (high BMI, enlarged WC) observed in urban subjects is compatible with the expected effects of Westernization in SSA. Differences in ethnicity could not explain the variability in body composition between rural and urban residents. Indeed the Bashi ethnic subgroup predominates both in Ibanda, the urban site as it does in Katana, the rural site. Despite a higher relative muscle mass in rural subjects, serum creatinine and eGFRcr values did not differ by site, whereas eGFRcys was slightly higher in urban than rural participants, probably due the metabolic profile (high BMI, weight, fat mass) seen in urban compared to rural subjects. Previous findings reported the strong relationship of body mass index and weight with cystatin C level. Further studies are needed in SSA to assess the accuracy of eGFRcr and eGFRcys compared to the measurement of GFR.

### Uncertain clinical utility of contemporary strategies for microalbuminuria testing [^111j8wYs]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2003). Low credibility.

Aims

To determine whether conventional dipstick tests for proteinuria accurately identified patients with diabetic nephropathy and whether repeat testing for elevated albumin excretion and screening for urinary tract infection was required as part of the screening process for microalbuminuria.

Methods

Random urine for albumin/creatinine ratio (ACR) was measured in all patients over a 6-month period. Patients who had a positive test (> 3.5 mg/mmol) were requested to provide two further samples for re-testing and a mid-stream urine specimen to screen for asymptomatic bacteriuria. The evaluation of accuracy of dipstick proteinuria was carried out in the samples collected over a fixed 2-week period.

Results

Dipstick vs. ACR — Of 221 samples collected, 142 were negative, 58 had 1+ and 21 had 2+ or more for dipstick proteinuria. At a threshold of 2+, the majority (81%) had ACR in the overt nephropathy range (> 30 mg/mmol) and none had it below 10 mg/mmol, whereas at 1+, only 28% had ACR in the overt nephropathy range and 19% even had normoalbuminuria. Repeat Testing — Of the 1832 patients who had microalbuminuria measured, 673 had a positive test and 248 returned repeat samples. Eighty-one patients returned two samples, of which 16 had discordant results, and 161 patients gave three samples, of which only 23 were false positives. The majority of these 39 patients had low-grade microalbuminuria (ACR 3.5–10 mg/mmol) in their first sample. The absolute benefit of repeat testing was only to 3.4% of the population who screened positive, while in a further 2.3% (two-sample responders) there was potential for confusion because of discordant results. Infection Screening — Of the 248 samples, only 31 had evidence of urinary infection.

Conclusion

Dipstick proteinuria of 1+ does not necessarily represent significant nephropathy. There is little or no benefit in repeat testing outside of the low microalbuminuria range but compliance to such testing is poor. Screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria as part of microalbuminuria screening is of questionable value.

Proteinuria — spot urine protein–creatinine ratio (UPCR) guidance and correction: The guideline discourages random (spot) UPCR assessments in patients with glomerular disease, yet in clinical practice a trend in spot UPCR in an individual patient over time provides meaningful input; if using the spot UPCR, efforts should be made to collect samples at the same time of day with similar activity, often with the first morning sample providing the most consistency. A correction is noted for Figure 4 on page 91: instead of " < 300 mg/g (< 30 mg/mmol)" for UPCR, the values should be " < 3,000 mg/g (< 300 mg/mmol) or < 3,500 mg/g" in order to correspond to the traditional thresholds for nephrotic-range proteinuria.

### Diagnostic accuracy of spot urinary protein and albumin to creatinine ratios for detection of significant proteinuria or adverse pregnancy outcome in patients with suspected pre-eclampsia: systematic review and meta-analysis [^115tSZdi]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

To model thresholds simultaneously and account for their correlation, we used a three step multivariate meta-analysis approach which extends that used by Reitsma et al. This three step approach was as follows. Step 1: take each study separately and estimate the logit sensitivity and logit specificity at each threshold available and their associated standard errors and correlation; if zero cells existed (for example, for the number of false negatives) at any threshold, then add 0.5 to all cells for all thresholds. Step 2: use a multivariate random effects meta-analysis to jointly synthesise all the estimates simultaneously across studies while accounting for their within study and between study correlation, their within study standard errors, and between study heterogeneity, to produce summary estimates of logit sensitivity and logit specificity at each threshold and an estimate of the between study standard deviation (heterogeneity) in sensitivity and specificity (on the logit scale) at each threshold. Step 3: fit a regression model to the summary estimates of logit sensitivity and logit specificity obtained for each threshold value, to ensure that the summary results are constrained and ordered appropriately (that is, the summary sensitivity decreases as the threshold increases, and the summary specificity increases as threshold increases), while again ensuring that the uncertainty and correlation between all summary estimates are accounted for. Using the regression lines, constrained summary estimates and their confidence intervals can then be obtained for each threshold and the summary receiver operating characteristics curve plotted.

To calculate the area under the summary curve, we extrapolated it to (0.1) and (1.0) at either side and integrated it by using cubic spines in Stata statistical software release 11 via the "integ" command. We excluded one study (Skweres et al) from this multivariate meta-analysis, as it had unusual results with sensitivity increasing as the threshold increased. We considered an alternative multivariate approach recommended by Hamza et al, but it would not converge.

Risk of CVD according to proteinuria and age

When stratified by proteinuria, the risk of CVD increased significantly with trace proteinuria compared with negative proteinuria in all age groups, and even further with positive proteinuria (Figs 4B and 5). Among participants with positive proteinuria, the HRs (95% CIs) for CVD were 1.50 (1.43–1.57), 1.43 (1.38–1.47), 1.31 (1.26–1.36) and 1.27 (1.19–1.35), respectively, at the ages of 40–64, 65–74, 75–84 and ≥ 85 years. The results were consistently observed in both males and females (Supplementary data, Fig. S8). The impact of trace or positive proteinuria on the risk of CVD did not diminish with increasing age (Fig. 4B). In the analyses of the risks for ischemic heart disease, HF and stroke, as with the composite CVD outcome, there was a tendency for the risk to increase with the degree of proteinuria (Supplementary data, Figs S9–S11). In the competing risks analysis, proteinuria was associated with an increase in CVD risk across all age groups, in a manner dependent on its severity (Supplementary data, Fig. S12).

Figure 5: Risk of CVD according to urine dipstick protein result and age. Analyses were restricted to individuals aged 40 years or older without a history of CVD. Urine dipstick protein was categorized into three groups: negative, trace and positive. The HR for CVD was calculated for each proteinuria value using negative proteinuria as a reference. The assessment was conducted for each of four age categories: 40–64 (A), 65–74 (B), 75–84 (C) and ≥ 85 years (D). Statistically significant differences across proteinuria categories were determined by Cox regression analyses.

### Clinical practice guidelines for chronic kidney disease in adults: part II. glomerular filtration rate, proteinuria, and other markers [^115uJsQ9]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

The Kidney Disease Outcome Quality Initiative of the National Kidney Foundation published clinical practice guidelines on chronic kidney disease in February 2002. Of the 15 guidelines, the first six are of greatest relevance to family physicians. Part II of this two-part review covers guidelines 4, 5, and 6. Glomerular filtration rate is the best overall indicator of kidney function. It is superior to the serum creatinine level, which varies with age, sex, and race and often does not reflect kidney function accurately. The glomerular filtration rate can be estimated using prediction equations that take into account the serum creatinine level and some or all of specific variables (age, sex, race, body size). In many patients, estimates of the glomerular filtration rate can replace 24-hour urine collections for creatinine clearance measurements. Urine dipsticks generally are acceptable for detecting proteinuria. To quantify proteinuria, the ratio of protein or albumin to creatinine in an untimed (spot) urine sample is an accurate alternative to measurement of protein excretion in a 24-hour urine collection. Patients with persistent proteinuria have chronic kidney disease. Other techniques for evaluating patients with chronic kidney disease include examination of urinary sediment, urine dipstick testing for red and white blood cells, and imaging studies of the kidneys (especially ultrasonography). These techniques also can help determine the underlying cause of chronic kidney disease. Family physicians should weigh the value of the National Kidney Foundation guidelines for their clinical practice based on the strength of evidence and perceived cost-effectiveness until additional evidence becomes available on the usefulness of the recommended quality indicators.

### Early change in proteinuria as a surrogate end point for kidney disease progression: an individual patient meta-analysis [^111DTC1u]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Background

It is controversial whether proteinuria is a valid surrogate end point for randomized trials in chronic kidney disease.

Study Design

Meta-analysis of individual patient-level data.

Setting & Population

Individual patient data for 9,008 patients from 32 randomized trials evaluating 5 intervention types.

Selection Criteria For Studies

Randomized controlled trials of kidney disease progression until 2007 with measurements of proteinuria both at baseline and during the first year of follow-up, with at least 1 further year of follow-up for the clinical outcome.

Predictor

Early change in proteinuria.

Outcomes

Doubling of serum creatinine level, end-stage renal disease, or death.

Results

Early decline in proteinuria was associated with lower risk of the clinical outcome (pooled HR, 0.74 per 50% reduction in proteinuria); this association was stronger at higher levels of baseline proteinuria. Pooled estimates for the proportion of treatment effect on the clinical outcome explained by early decline in proteinuria ranged from -7.0% (95%CI, -40.6% to 26.7%) to 43.9% (95%CI, 25.3% to 62.6%) across 5 intervention types. The direction of the pooled treatment effects on early change in proteinuria agreed with the direction of the treatment effect on the clinical outcome for all 5 intervention types, with the magnitudes of the pooled treatment effects on the 2 end points agreeing for 4 of the 5 intervention types. The pooled treatment effects on both end points were simultaneously stronger at higher levels of proteinuria. However, statistical power was insufficient to determine whether differences in treatment effects on the clinical outcome corresponded to differences in treatment effects on proteinuria between individual studies.

Limitations

Limited variety of interventions tested and low statistical power for many chronic kidney disease clinical trials.

Conclusions

These results provide new evidence supporting the use of an early reduction in proteinuria as a surrogate end point, but do not provide sufficient evidence to establish its validity in all settings.

### Estimation of proteinuria as a predictor of complications of pre-eclampsia: a systematic review [^115jaGg6]. BMC Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Results

Literature identification and study quality

Figure 1 summarizes the process of literature identification and selection. There were 16 primary articles that met the selection criteria including a total of 6749 women (Figure 1). Eight articles reported estimation of proteinuria by laboratory method only, five by bedside dipstick urinalysis only, two by either of the above methods and one by spot urine protein:creatinine ratio. The salient features (population subgroups, test characteristics and reference standards) of each individual study can be obtained from the authors. The definition of pre-eclampsia differed widely between the studies. The test threshold in individual studies for laboratory estimation varied from 0.3 g/24 h to 10 g/24 h, or was reported as an increase in proteinuria by 2 g/24 h between two measurements. The cut-off levels for bedside urinalysis using visual reagents ranged from 1+ to 4+ of proteinuria. One study evaluated the accuracy of spot urine protein: creatinine ratio for threshold levels of 500 mg/mmol and 900 mg/mmol in the prediction of maternal and fetal complications. The methodological quality of the included studies is given in Figure 2.

HIV-related chronic kidney disease — monitoring kidney function and albuminuria/proteinuria: The CKD-EPI creatinine equation is more accurate and precise than MDRD in the general population and in HIV-infected persons and is the preferred creatinine-based GFR estimation method; the MDRD equation underestimates exogenously measured GFR in individuals with normal or near-normal kidney function; the Cockcroft–Gault equation estimates creatinine clearance rather than GFR and is less accurate and precise than MDRD and CKD-EPI, though it has historically been used for dosing of renally cleared drugs; most clinical laboratories report creatinine-based GFR by CKD-EPI or MDRD; the CKD-EPI equation that uses both creatinine and cystatin C has been reported to be more precise and accurate than either single-biomarker equation, yet many laboratories do not report cystatin C values calibrated to an international standard; use of the combined biomarker equation or an exogenous GFR measure may be helpful when estimated GFR–creatinine is near 60 mL/minute/1.73 m^2 if a more accurate estimate would affect management; urinalysis is an acceptable screen for albuminuria/proteinuria; proteinuria ≥ 1+ on urinalysis should be quantified with either albumin-to-creatinine ratio or a protein-to-creatinine ratio; and diabetes management guidelines recommend monitoring albuminuria annually, which is appropriate to apply to HIV-infected diabetics.

### Diagnostic accuracy of spot urinary protein and albumin to creatinine ratios for detection of significant proteinuria or adverse pregnancy outcome in patients with suspected pre-eclampsia: systematic review and meta-analysis [^113K2zxJ]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Multivariate meta-analysis for protein to creatinine ratio to detect significant proteinuria compared with 24 hour urine collection

For many of the studies, we could extract test accuracy results for protein to creatinine ratio at multiple thresholds; for example, for Al Ragip et al, a two by two table expressing the number of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives was available for each of five protein to creatinine ratio thresholds (0.13, 0.18, 0.19, 0.2, and 0.49). Multiple test accuracy results within the same study are correlated, as the same patients are contributing their data to each of the thresholds. For example, one would expect a strong positive correlation between test accuracy results at neighbouring thresholds. This within study correlation between thresholds should be accounted for in the meta-analysis by synthesising all thresholds simultaneously, as it contains important information that is otherwise lost. In particular, by using the within study correlations one can "borrow strength" across thresholds; this means that, for example, if a study presents results for a threshold of 0.2 but not for threshold 0.3 then, with any knowledge of the within study correlation between estimates at 0.2 and 0.3 in other studies, this study can still provide some indirect information about test accuracy at threshold 0.3.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2018 KDIGO clinical practice guideline for the prevention, diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of hepatitis C [^116exiAe]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2020). High credibility.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV)–infected kidney transplant recipients — monitoring and biopsy thresholds are specified as follows. Untreated HCV-positive kidney transplant recipients should have the same liver disease follow-up as HCV-positive non-transplant patients, as outlined in the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) guidelines (Not Graded). HCV-infected kidney transplant recipients should be tested at least every 6 months for proteinuria (Not Graded). We suggest that patients who develop new-onset proteinuria (either urine protein-to-creatinine ratio > 1 g/g or 24-hour urine protein > 1 g on 2 or more occasions) have an allograft biopsy with immunofluorescence and electron microscopy included in the analysis (2D). We recommend treatment with a DAA regimen in patients with post-transplant HCV-associated glomerulonephritis (1D).

### A comparison of the utility of the urine dipstick and urine protein-to-creatinine ratio for predicting microalbuminuria in patients with non-diabetic lifestyle-related diseases-a comparison with diabetes [^115EU2H7]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Regarding the detection of uACR ≥ 30 mg/gCr by a single dipstick measurement, the sensitivity + specificity — 1 value was the highest in non-diabetic and diabetic patients with more than trace proteinuria, as shown in Supplemental Table 2. Findings in previous reports have varied, reporting values of "sensitivity 37.1%, specificity 97.3%, positive predictive value (PPV) 71.4%, negative predictive value (NPV) 89.5%"; "sensitivity 69.4%, specificity 86.8%, PPV 27.1%, NPV 97.6%"; and "sensitivity 43.6% specificity 93.6%, PPV 34.6%, NPV 95.5%" for more than trace proteinuria. This difference is believed to be due to the fact that there are many cases of advanced CKD, as the subjects in this study were outpatients with lifestyle-related diseases, and because dipstick evaluations are affected by the urine concentration and test reagents. Although it is necessary to confirm the results when the PPV is low, even if the sensitivity of uACR ≥ 30 mg/gCr is high, this study indicated that the PPV was high and suggested the utility of dipstick test, even if a dipstick proteinuria evaluation showed low sensitivity. However, as the NPV was relatively low, a uACR of ≥ 30 mg/gCr cannot be ruled out in cases of negative proteinuria.

### Methods for diagnosing proteinuria-when to use which test and why: a review [^116ecPJu]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Proteinuria plays a central role in the diagnosis of kidney disease and has a high prognostic value. The test methods used differ considerably regarding their impact on test accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. Therefore, knowledge of the methodology is crucial for the interpretation of the results. In addition to the distinction between semiquantitative and quantitative tests, there are also relevant differences within the 2 methods. In general, semiquantitative tests are easy to handle but have limitations such as incomplete quantification, a lack of specificity regarding the type of proteinuria, and a high rate of false-positive results that require retesting with a quantitative method for verification. In contrast, quantitative methods, especially immunoassays, have the advantages of high test accuracy and the possibility of targeted detection of specific protein molecules in addition to albumin. However, these methods are more expensive and require access to a laboratory or an electronic point-of-care device. In this Review, the different types of tests for proteinuria and their underlying methodologies and strengths and weaknesses are discussed in detail to allow a rational decision of use and the correct interpretation of the results depending on the clinical context.

### Diagnostic accuracy of spot urinary protein and albumin to creatinine ratios for detection of significant proteinuria or adverse pregnancy outcome in patients with suspected pre-eclampsia: systematic review and meta-analysis [^116AjnBq]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Pre-eclampsia is a major cause of maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality that complicates 2–8% of all pregnancies. It is a multisystem endothelial disease that leads to glomeruloendotheliosis, and in severe cases it may lead to renal impairment and failure. "Permeability" of the glomerular basement membrane to proteins, including albumin, is key to the diagnosis. The presence of significant proteinuria (in addition to hypertension) predisposes a pregnant woman to coagulopathy, liver disease, and stroke. Serious perinatal morbidity occurs in the form of preterm delivery (often iatrogenic) and fetal growth restriction. The diagnosis of pre-eclampsia (International Society for the Study of Hypertension in Pregnancy) is determined by the presence of elevated blood pressure combined with significant proteinuria (≥ 0.3 g/24 hours) after the 20th week of gestation in a previously normotensive, non-proteinuric patient. One of the "cornerstones" of antenatal care includes a screening programme directed at the detection of pre-eclampsia with regular measurements of blood pressure and urinalysis for proteinuria (often using urinalysis dipsticks). The "dipstick analysis", using visual reagent strips, is quick, portable, and easy to do. However, urine samples are taken at varying times of the day. This test is complicated by relatively high false positive and false negative rates, so it is almost always followed up by the "gold standard" test of 24 hour urine collection. This test is in itself not without problems. The collection is cumbersome, time consuming, inconvenient (to patients as well as hospital staff), and subject to errors such as incomplete collection leading to inaccuracies (in 13–68% of collections). Delays may occur in the institution of a management plan while results are awaited, and verification of diagnosis of pre-eclampsia may not be possible if patients deliver before the urine collection is complete. The laboratory assay methods used also vary widely, and the incidence of significant proteinuria has been shown to vary depending on the assay used.

### A comparison of the utility of the urine dipstick and urine protein-to-creatinine ratio for predicting microalbuminuria in patients with non-diabetic lifestyle-related diseases-a comparison with diabetes [^1131zdeo]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

A urine dipstick evaluation and uPCR, and uACR measurements were performed in the same urine samples three times per case on different days within one year with the second and third measurements performed using early morning spot urine samples. Patients whose proteinuria had increased to ≥ 0.5 g/gCr at the second or third measurement were not excluded. Patients whose eGFR had decreased by ≥ 30% within 3 months were excluded. The average eGFR during the period was used to determine the GFR category.

Negative proteinuria (-) as 0, (±) trace as 0.5, (+) as 1, 2 (+) as 2, 3 (+) as 3 were used to determine the dipstick proteinuria score. The sum of the three urine protein dipstick scores for both non-diabetic and diabetic patients showed a significant positive correlation with the sum of the three uPCRs (Supplemental Fig. 1 a, b), which was used as the sum of the urine protein dipstick scores (SuPDS).

The three dipstick proteinuria evaluations were classified as proteinuria(-) of 0, proteinuria ≥ (±) of 1, or proteinuria(±)(-) of 0, proteinuria ≥ (+) of 1, using dummy variables, in order to examine the usefulness of differentiating micro- and macroalbuminuria by qualitative proteinuria using a binomial logistic regression.

The A1 caregory (uPCR < 0.15 g/gCr) is divided into three equal parts: A1L (uPCR 0–0.05 g/gCr), A1M (uPCR 0.06–0.10 g/gCr), and A1H (uPCR 0.11–0.14 g/gCr) in order to examine the association between dipstick proteinuria, uPCR and uACR.

### Urinary protein-to-creatinine ratio in pregnant women after dipstick testing: prospective observational study [^1156fmNa]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2015). Low credibility.

Postpartum urine samples were more dilute than those obtained antepartum (Table 3): in the 178 women for whom both ante- and postnatal urine samples were available, [Cr] was significantly lower for postnatal urine samples than for those obtained antenatally. Although not statistically significant, the frequency of SPIP among urine samples with negative/equivocal dipstick test results was higher for postnatal than antenatal urine samples (28% [25/89] vs. 16% [7/43], respectively, P = 0.1933), suggesting that false negative dipstick test results were more likely to occur postpartum than antepartum.

Finally, the associations between reasons for the first P/Cr test and P/Cr test results were examined (Table 4). Reasons for the first P/Cr test were specified in 1028 (99.5%) of the 1033 women enrolled in the study. At the first P/Cr test, hypertension was already confirmed in 222 (22%) but not in 806 (78%) of these 1028 women. Among women with similar dipstick test results, the risk of having SPIP was consistently and significantly higher for hypertensive than for normotensive women: 18% (14/77) vs. 3.2% (8/251) for negative/equivocal dipstick test result, 47% (26/55) vs. 8.7% (37/425) for 1+ dipstick test result, and 91% (82/90) vs. 59% (44/75) for ≥ 2+ dipstick test result. The risk of SPIP was 16% (9/55) for normotensive women with 1+ dipstick test result on two successive antenatal care visits. It was notable that [Cr] in the urine samples with ≥ 1+ on dipstick test was significantly lower for hypertensive than normotensive women.

Effect of the intervention on screening outcomes

Overall, the proportion of patients who completed proteinuria screening after 3 months was greater in the intervention arm than in the control arm (28.9% vs. 18.0%; odds ratio [OR] 1.85, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.37–2.49) (Table 2). There was no significant difference between the intervention and control arms in the number of detected albuminuria cases (4 vs. 4; OR 1.00, 95% CI: 0.25–4.03) or an exploratory outcome of detected trace or 1+ urine dipstick protein (34 vs. 23; OR 1.52, 95% CI: 0.88–2.61). Notably, only 3/23 (13%) patients in the control group and 3/34 (9%) patients in the intervention group with trace or 1+ protein on urine dipstick had a quantitative test (ACR or protein/creatinine ratio) checked over the 3-month study period.

### Urinary protein-to-creatinine ratio in pregnant women after dipstick testing: prospective observational study [^114ggBcV]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Preeclampsia (PE) is a life-threatening complication for both the mother and fetus. As PE is usually diagnosed in women that developed both hypertension and significant proteinuria in pregnancy (SPIP), assessment of proteinuria is an important constituent of antenatal care for pregnant women. The dipstick test is widely used in screening for SPIP, but concerns have been raised regarding its accuracy. Both false negative and positive results can occur on dipstick test for prediction of SPIP. The dipstick test is designed to reflect urinary protein concentration [P] at a certain cut-off level not corrected by urinary creatinine concentration [Cr]; dipsticks with ≥ 1+ on visual judgment for urinary protein concentration ≥ 30 mg/dL are widely used in Japan. It has been suggested that negative and positive dipstick test results are likely to occur in diluted and concentrated urine samples with lower and higher creatinine concentrations, respectively, regardless of actual daily protein loss in the urine.

### Association of high pulse pressure with proteinuria in subjects with diabetes, prediabetes, or normal glucose tolerance in a large Japanese general population sample [^115U1JZx]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

Urinalysis by the dipstick method was performed on a single spot urine specimen collected in the early morning after overnight fasting. Urine dipstick results are interpreted by the medical staff in each local medical institution and recorded as −, ±, 1+, 2+, and 3+. In Japan, it is recommended and widely adopted by the activity of the Japanese Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards that all urine dipstick tests be manufactured so that a urine dipstick result of 1+ will correspond to a urinary protein level of 30 mg/dL. In the current study, proteinuria was defined as 1+ or more. eGFR was derived using the following equation: eGFR (mL/min/1.73 m²) = 194 × age (years) −0.287 × serum creatinine (mg/dL) −1.094 (if women ×0.739).

### Assessing proteinuria in chronic kidney disease: protein-creatinine ratio versus albumin-creatinine ratio [^111hKcKx]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Quantification of proteinuria is important in the assessment of chronic kidney disease (CKD). The aim of this study was to investigate the optimal test to identify significant proteinuria.

Methods

We retrospectively assessed the relationship between total protein:creatinine ratio (TPCR), albumin:creatinine ratio (ACR) and 24-h urine total protein in 6842 patients with CKD focusing on performance at thresholds of 0.5 and 1 g/day of proteinuria.

Results

The relationship between ACR and TPCR is non-linear. TPCR is highly correlated with 24-h urine protein (Spearman's rho = 0.91), though ACR also performs well (rho = 0.84). Using receiver-operator characteristic curve analysis, TPCR outperforms ACR at predicting 0.5 g/day [area under the curve (AUC) 0.967 vs 0.951, P < 0.001] and 1 g/day of proteinuria (AUC 0.968 vs 0.947, P = 0.004). A TPCR threshold of 100 mg/mmol had a higher sensitivity (94% vs 79%) but lower specificity (88% vs 95%) than an ACR of 70 mg/mmol to predict 1 g/day of total proteinuria. To achieve comparable sensitivity, the ACR threshold falls to 17.5 mg/mmol, with lower specificity than TPCR (69.8%). Sensitivity of TPCR rose with increasing age, and in females: to achieve 95% sensitivity in a man < 49 years, requires a TPCR of 65 mg/mmol, compared to 179 mg/mmol in a woman > 79 years. Non-albumin proteinuria was a lower proportion of total proteinuria in patients receiving angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockade than in those who were not (P < 0.001).

Conclusions

TPCR is a more sensitive screening test than ACR to predict clinically relevant proteinuria. The diagnostic performance of both tests varies substantially with age and gender, and should be taken into consideration when interpreting results. Total proteinuria cannot be adequately predicted from ACR, and our results suggest that caution is appropriate before utilizing ACR in patients with non-diabetic CKD.

### Association of single measurements of dipstick proteinuria, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and hematocrit with 25-year incidence of end-stage renal disease in the multiple risk factor intervention trial [^114EqEmk]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2006). Low credibility.

The incidence of ESRD is increasing rapidly. Limited information exists regarding early markers for the development of ESRD. This study aimed to determine over 25 yr the risk for ESRD associated with proteinuria, estimated GFR (eGFR), and hematocrit in men who did not have identified kidney disease and were randomly assigned into the Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Study (MRFIT). A total of 12,866 men who were at high risk for heart disease were enrolled (1973 to 1975) and followed through 1999. Renal replacement therapy was ascertained by matching identifiers with the United States Renal Data System's data; vital status was from the National Death Index. Men who initiated renal replacement therapy or died as a result of kidney disease were deemed to have developed ESRD. Dipstick urine for proteinuria, eGFR, and hematocrit were related to development of ESRD. During 25 yr, 213 (1.7%) men developed ESRD. Predictors of ESRD were dipstick proteinuria of 1+ or ≥ 2+ (hazard ratio [HR] 3.1 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.8 to 5.4] and 15.7 [95% CI 10.3 to 23.9] respectively) and an eGFR of < 60 ml/min per 1.73 m² (HR 2.4; 95% CI 1.5 to 3.8). Correlation between eGFR and serum creatinine was 0.9; the risk for ESRD with a 1-SD difference of each was identical (HR 1.21). Bivariate analysis demonstrated a 41-fold increase in ESRD risk in those with an eGFR < 60 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) and ≥ 2+ proteinuria (95% CI 15.2 to 71.1). There was no association between hematocrit and ESRD. Other baseline measures that independently predicted ESRD included age, cigarette smoking, BP, low HDL cholesterol, and fasting glucose. Among middle-aged men who were at high risk for cardiovascular disease but had no clinical evidence of cardiovascular disease or significant kidney disease, dipstick proteinuria and an eGFR value < 60 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) were strong predictors of long-term development of ESRD. It remains unknown whether intervention for proteinuria or early identification of those with chronic kidney disease reduces the risk for ESRD.

### Urine protein: creatinine ratio vs 24-hour urine protein for proteinuria management: analysis from the phase 3 REFLECT study of lenvatinib vs sorafenib in hepatocellular carcinoma [^112Sj9st]. British Journal of Cancer (2019). Medium credibility.

Proteinuria is a class effect of antiangiogenic agents, and a well-documented lenvatinib-associated adverse effect.– Rates of any-grade/grade ≥ 3 proteinuria observed in lenvatinib-treated patients were 25%/6% in the phase 3 REFLECT study in unresectable HCC,31%/10% in the phase 3 SELECT in patients with RR-DTC, and 31%/19% in a phase 2 study in patients with advanced/metastatic RCC.

Patients receiving lenvatinib are monitored regularly for proteinuria using a urine sample dipstick method. The current standard management requires a 24-hour urine protein test if a dipstick proteinuria result of ≥ 2+ is detected, with the recommendation that lenvatinib treatment should be withheld if a proteinuria level of ≥ 2 g/24 h is detected. This 24-hour urine protein test relies on patient collection of urine overnight, which is burdensome and may be influenced by patient compliance. However, the single ("spot") urine protein:creatinine ratio (UPCR) is a simple and convenient alternative test that is often used to detect proteinuria associated with certain medical conditions, e.g. chronic kidney disease and diabetes. UPCR is calculated by dividing the level of protein (mg/dl) in a spot urine test by the creatinine level (mg/dl). This approach was first validated in 1983 by Ginsberg and colleagues. It is based on the premise that urinary creatinine excretion and the protein excretion rate in the presence of a stable glomerular filtration rate are fairly constant in a given patient. Thus, a simple ratio of the 2 in a single-void urine sample would reflect cumulative protein excretion over a day (because the ratio of 2 stable rates would cancel out the time factor).

To determine whether UPCR could be a useful and more convenient assessment for proteinuria in patients receiving lenvatinib, we evaluated the correlation between proteinuria assessment by UPCR and 24-hour urine protein in patients with HCC from the REFLECT study.

### Diagnostic accuracy study of urine dipstick in relation to 24-hour measurement as a screening tool for proteinuria in lupus nephritis [^1155HsNp]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

Early detection of renal involvement in lupus prevents poor outcomes. Although published guidelines recommend urine dipstick as an appropriate screening test and evidence suggests a majority of American rheumatologists use dipstick to screen for proteinuria, the performance of this diagnostic approach in lupus has not been reported. We examined the validity of qualitative urine dipstick versus quantitative 24-hour measurement to accurately detect proteinuria, including low-level proteinuria.

Methods

We performed a diagnostic accuracy study using paired samples from the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and the Ohio State University School of Medicine lupus cohorts. All qualitative urine dipstick values were obtained within 1 day of a 24-hour urine collection.

Results

We analyzed the performance of 3 urine dipstick assays to detect proteinuria compared to 24-hour protein/creatinine ratios, using 2224 dipstick measures from 296 patients. The sensitivity of a ≥ 1+ dipstick result to detect quantitative proteinuria (≥ 0.50 g protein/g creatinine) was 82.7% for the Clinitek, 97.7% for the Atlas, and 85.5% for the Bayer assay. The corresponding sensitivity to detect low-level proteinuria, (0.50–0.99 g protein/g creatinine) was 63.1%, 96.4%, and 80.7%, respectively. The specificity to correctly exclude proteinuria (< 0.50 g protein/g creatinine) with negative/trace results was 86.1%, 62.2%, and 59.4%. There was considerable variability in the range of protein/creatinine ratios detected at each dipstick level of proteinuria.

Conclusion

Urine dipsticks demonstrate substantial variability and often poor validity to accurately detect proteinuria at quantitative levels; this warrants further diagnostic evaluation. Clinicians should consider quantified proteinuria assays as a more accurate screening tool in the diagnostic evaluation of lupus nephritis.

Evaluation of albuminuria — initial testing, confirmation, and interpretation: Use the following measurements for initial testing of albuminuria (in descending order of preference), and in all cases, a first void in the morning midstream urine sample is preferred. If measuring urine protein, use urine protein-to-creatinine ratio (PCR), reagent strip urinalysis for total protein with automated reading, or reagent strip urinalysis for total protein with manual reading. Use more accurate methods when albuminuria is detected using less accurate methods, confirm reagent strip positive albuminuria and/or proteinuria by quantitative laboratory measurement and express as a ratio to urine creatinine wherever possible, and confirm ACR ≥ 30 mg/g (≥ 3 mg/mmol) on a random untimed urine with a subsequent first morning void in the morning midstream urine sample. Understand factors that may affect interpretation of measurements of urine albumin and urine creatinine and order confirmatory tests as indicated.

### Screening for proteinuria in patients with lupus: a survey of practice preferences among American rheumatologists [^113GrZDT]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

Screening for proteinuria in patients with lupus requires a diagnostic method with adequate validity to detect early disease. Recent studies have called into question the validity of qualitative proteinuria measurements. We set out to assess if American rheumatologists have changed their practice preferences in response to these data.

Methods

Using an online survey tool, we questioned practicing physicians, who were members of the American College of Rheumatology in 2005, about their demographic characteristics and preferred method to detect proteinuria in patients with known lupus.

Results

In our survey, 64.6% of 473 respondents reported using qualitative urinalysis (dipstick) as the primary method of screening for proteinuria. The remaining 32.7% preferred quantitative measurements (spot protein to creatinine ratio 16.8%; 24-h protein 7.8%; microalbuminuria 4.1%; 24-h protein to creatinine ratio 4.1%). Rheumatologists in practice for more than 10 years were more likely than those in practice for less time to use a qualitative method. Although physicians using dipsticks were most likely to use 1+ as a cutoff for significant proteinuria, 28.5% report using a threshold of ≥ 2+.

Conclusion

Despite recent reports describing the inadequacy of urine dipstick as a measurement for low-grade proteinuria, the majority of practicing rheumatologists are utilizing that method for screening in patients with lupus. Because early detection of lupus nephritis has implications for prevention of renal associated morbidity and mortality, these findings should prompt further investigation of the adequacy and role of urine dipstick as a screening tool for lupus.

### Proteinuria and the risk of incident atrial fibrillation according to glycemic stages: a nationwide population-based cohort study [^114hrtzJ]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Diabetes mellitus (DM) and proteinuria each independently raise the risk of atrial fibrillation (AF). We aimed to investigate the relationship between proteinuria and the risk of incident AF across glycemic stages.

Methods

A cohort of 4,044,524 individuals without prior AF and type 1 DM was selected from the 2009 Korean National Health Insurance Service health checkup data. The individuals were categorized into five glycemic stages: normal, prediabetes, new-onset DM, early DM (< 5 years), and late DM (≥ 5 years). Proteinuria was graded using a urine dipstick test. The development of incident AF was tracked until 2023.

Results

Overall, the cohort (mean age 47 ± 14 years, 44.8% female) showed increasing annual AF incidence rates from 2.05 to 7.22 per 1000 person-years from normal to late DM (p < 0.001). Incidence rates increased from 2.46 to 8.18 per 1000 person-years with increasing proteinuria (p < 0.001). Adjusted Cox regression models revealed a heightened AF risk with higher proteinuria across all glycemic stages (adjusted hazard ratios for urine dipstick 3+/4+: 1.58, 1.64, 2.39, 2.12, and 2.53 for normal, prediabetes, new-onset DM, early DM, and late DM, respectively). The proteinuria-AF association was more pronounced in individuals with DM than in those without DM but was similar among the new-onset and established DM groups.

Conclusions

Proteinuria is an independent and significant risk factor for incident AF at all glycemic stages. The risk of incident AF in patients with DM can be stratified by measuring the level of proteinuria rather than comparing the duration of DM. Tailoring clinical strategies to proteinuria level could potentially mitigate this risk, improving patient outcomes.

### Novel urinary protein biomarkers predicting the development of microalbuminuria and renal function decline in type 1 diabetes [^113E3xn2]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

Despite tremendous progress in treatment, patients with type 1 diabetes still live 15 years shorter, experience excess morbidity, and have medical costs over 10 times higher than the general population. Modification of traditional risk factors has made only limited impact on development of renal complications in these patients. Improved glycemic control reduces progression to early stages of microvascular complications in type 1 diabetes even years later, but the risk of diabetic nephropathy is not completely abolished by improved glycemic control or lowering blood pressure. Whereas rates of end-stage renal disease have declined over recent years, after 30 years of diabetes duration, the cumulative incidence of end-stage renal disease is 7.8% among patients with type 1 diabetes. Further, the presence of microvascular complications is associated with increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease, which remains the leading cause of death in people with type 1 diabetes.

The development of renal complications and eventual end-stage renal disease in people with diabetes has been thought to follow a linear path involving the development of microalbuminuria, progressing to frank proteinuria. It was thought that renal function only declines once proteinuria is present and that regression of microalbuminuria indicates reversal of the disease progress. However, clinical trials have recently demonstrated that this dogma may be incorrect. First, renal function as measured by glomerular filtration rate (GFR) declines before the development of proteinuria, demonstrating that there is an earlier phase of kidney damage that could be detected and targeted with interventions. Second, kidney damage can progress even when microalbuminuria has regressed. The identification of novel biomarkers for early renal disease is therefore a high priority.

Urine is an easily accessible biological matrix for which to identify new biomarkers. The urinary proteome is very complex, containing 1,000 of proteins and peptides that are derived from filtration/secretion/reabsorption processes within the kidney. Many of these proteins are sensitive to alterations in the kidney, and urinary proteomics provides a platform from which to simultaneously quantify hundreds of urinary proteins.

### Urine dipstick as a screening test for serum creatinine elevation in emergency department patients with severe hypertension [^114LdJ97]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

Patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with severe hypertension require assessment for acute end-organ damage. Serum creatinine (SCr) measurement is routinely recommended to detect renal dysfunction. The authors assessed the utility of the urine dipstick test in screening for acute SCr elevation in this population.

Methods

The authors performed a prospective study of adult ED patients with diastolic blood pressures ≥ 115 mm Hg that persisted for ≥ 30 minutes or necessitated emergent treatment. Excluded were menstruating and pregnant women and patients with urinary infection, trauma, or dialysis dependence. Patients reporting a history of renal disease were excluded if the SCr was abnormal and no baseline value was available. Each subject had an SCr and urine dipstick test. The authors examined the performance of the dipstick in identifying an elevated SCr, defined as SCr > 1.2 mg/dL or > 25% above baseline.

Results

Of 143 patients, 42 had SCr > 1.2 mg/dL. Eighteen reported prior renal disease but had an SCr that was normal or ≤ 25% above baseline. The remaining 24 subjects comprised the elevated SCr group. The presence of either proteinuria or hematuria on dipstick identified these patients with 100% sensitivity and 29.7% specificity. Specificity rose to 42.4% without loss of sensitivity when an abnormal dipstick was defined as hematuria or ≥ 1+ proteinuria.

Conclusions

The urine dipstick may be an effective screening test for SCr elevation in patients with severe hypertension. A restrictive definition of an abnormal dipstick would identify all patients with elevated SCr and substantially reduce the number of SCr assays necessary.

3 MEASUREMENT

3.1 Measurement technique and urine sample type

Historically, urinary protein assessment relied on measuring 24‐h total protein excretion. Advances in the understanding of kidney disease, as reflected in the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) 2012 guideline, shifted the focus to albuminuria, recognising it as the predominant urinary protein in most kidney diseases. These recommendations have been retained in the updated KDIGO 2024 guidelines, further reinforcing the clinical importance of albuminuria assessment. Measuring urinary albumin, now widely recommended, is a relatively standardised and sensitive procedure that improves the sensitivity, quality and consistency of kidney disease detection and management. Although total protein measurements are less expensive, they lack the sensitivity to detect low but clinically significant levels of albuminuria, leading to their replacement by albumin‐specific assays (Table 1).

TABLE 1
Comparison of albuminuria measurement methods.

Albuminuria can be assessed using semi‐quantitative dipstick tests, particularly in resource‐limited settings. These reagent strips provide a quick, inexpensive and convenient screening method but have limited sensitivity and specificity, partly due to their inability to account for urine concentration or dilution. While these tests may eventually facilitate at‐home monitoring for CKD patients, they should currently be regarded as preliminary tools requiring confirmation through laboratory‐based methods to ensure accurate diagnosis and effective clinical decision‐making.

While 24‐h urine collection is the gold standard for assessing albuminuria due to its ability to account for variations in urine tonicity and the circadian rhythm of urinary albumin excretion, practical limitations often necessitate alternative methods. Although 24‐h urine collections provide comprehensive data, including assessments of muscle mass (via 24‐h creatinine excretion) and dietary intake (sodium and protein intake measured through sodium and urea excretion, respectively), they are labour‐intensive and prone to errors such as incomplete collection. Timed overnight collections are less cumbersome while still covering a reasonable collection interval; however, compliance remains poor compared to spot urine sampling. These challenges have led to the widespread adoption of more practical methods, including random urine samples, first‐morning voids and early‐morning voids.

### Diagnostic accuracy of spot urinary protein and albumin to creatinine ratios for detection of significant proteinuria or adverse pregnancy outcome in patients with suspected pre-eclampsia: systematic review and meta-analysis [^1168oAzc]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Summary results for protein to creatinine ratio to detect significant proteinuria compared with 24 hour urine collection

Fifteen studies compared protein to creatinine ratio with 24 hour urine collection (2790 women). No studies evaluated protein to creatinine ratio and adverse pregnancy outcome. Of the 15 studies using 24 hour collection as the outcome measure, 10 were in pregnant women with hypertension, four were in a population with hypertension and proteinuria on dipstick analysis, and in one the population was not clear. Thirteen of the 15 papers reported the approximate time during the day that the spot test was taken, and nine of the 15 reported the timing with respect to the 24 hour urine collection.

Tables 1and 2show the results for the constrained sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios using the multivariate meta-analysis. Thirteen studies reported adequate data on the threshold of the reference standard for inclusion in this analysis. For sensitivity, no threshold gave a summary sensitivity estimate above 90%. Threshold values between 0.31 and 0.13 gave summary estimates between 80% and 90%, and the summary estimate was below 70% for thresholds of 0.45 and above. For specificity, no threshold gave a summary specificity estimate above 90%, but thresholds between 0.39 and 0.50 gave summary estimates between 81% and 87%. The summary specificity estimate was 70% or more for a threshold of 0.22 or above.

### First and second morning spot urine protein measurements for the assessment of proteinuria: a diagnostic accuracy study in kidney transplant recipients [^114oGESq]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Previous diagnostic accuracy studies did not provide information on allograft histology and on the type of urine protein excretion associated with different levels of proteinuria, which may influence the accuracy of PCR measurements. With an increase in proteinuria, urinary levels of individual proteins albumin and α-1 microglobulin were also increased. Nevertheless, α-1 microglobulin increased in parallel with albumin excretion only in patients with low to moderate proteinuria (i.e. < 1 g/day), while high-grade proteinuria was mainly associated with an increase in albumin excretion. This is in line with previous observations, which showed that low-grade proteinuria and small increases in urinary albumin may result from proximal tubular damage where urinary albumin often increases in parallel with α-1 microglobulin. In those patients with marked glomerular pathology heavy proteinuria composed overwhelmingly of albumin is common, and thus the correlation of total urinary protein and albumin with lower molecular weight tubular proteins may be lost. In our study, the predominance of albuminuria and relatively lower amounts of tubular proteins may explain greater diagnostic accuracy of ePER in patients with high-grade proteinuria. Spot urine protein and albumin excretion were greater in patients with previous diagnosis of AMR and recurrent glomerular disease than in patients with T-cell rejection or other non-rejection findings. In contrast, α-1 microglobulin excretion was not significantly associated with different histological phenotypes. These associations were similar for the first and second morning urine samples. However, this study did not examine whether spot urine protein or albumin excretion could predict specific histologic phenotypes of allograft injury. In previous studies, urine protein profiles alone have not predicted specific histologic injury phenotypes.

IgA nephropathy (IgAN) — risk assessment and proteinuria targets indicate that dynamic assessment of patient risk over time should be performed, and proteinuria reduction to under 1 g/d is a surrogate marker of improved kidney outcome in IgAN with reduction to under 1 g/d a reasonable treatment target. The commentary notes that proteinuria > 0.75 g/d despite optimized supportive care correlates with high risk of disease progression and at the same time suggests that a value of < 1 g/d should be the target.

KDOQI US commentary on KDIGO hepatitis C in chronic kidney disease — posttransplant management and antiviral therapy indicates that all conventional current maintenance immunosuppressive regimens can be considered for use in HCV-infected kidney transplant recipients. It is suggested that HCV-infected kidney transplant recipients more than 6 months after transplantation have their liver disease evaluated at least annually. It is suggested that HCV-infected kidney transplant recipients be screened for the development of new-onset diabetes mellitus after transplantation and be tested at least every 3 to 6 months for proteinuria. It is suggested that patients who develop new-onset proteinuria (either urine protein/creatinine ratio > 1 or 24-hour urine protein greater than 1 g on 2 or more occasions) have an allograft biopsy with immunofluorescence and electron microscopy included in the analysis. For HCV-infected kidney transplant recipients in whom the benefits of antiviral treatment clearly outweigh the risks, monotherapy with standard IFN is suggested, and because of the risk of rejection, kidney transplant recipients with HCV-associated glomerulopathy not receive IFN-based therapy unless the benefits of therapy outweigh the risks of treatment. After transplantation, HCV-infected kidney transplant recipients should be monitored for the development of liver disease, hyperglycemia, and proteinuria.

### Predictive value of spot versus 24-hour measures of proteinuria for death, end-stage kidney disease or chronic kidney disease progression [^114KVCYN]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Table 5
Studies comparing different measures of proteinuria in a CKD population in predicting death or progression of disease

UPCR urine protein-to-creatinine ratio, UACR urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio, 24 h UPE 24-h urine protein excretion, RRT renal replacement therapy eGFR estimated glomerular filtration rate, CKD chronic kidney disease, SCr serum creatinine, ESKD end-stage kidney disease

Our study showed some mixed results on individual secondary outcomes, which should be interpreted in the context of a small number of events for each outcome. In the multivariable model, we did not detect a significant association between death and any of the proteinuria measures. For ESKD, we found a significant association with UACR and 24-protein excretion. In contrast, only 24-h urinary protein excretion was significantly associated with a > 30% decline in eGFR in the multivariable model. Spot UACR has been conclusively shown to be associated with both death and ESKD risk in the CKD prognosis consortium meta-analyses which included both the clinical and general population cohorts. Our much smaller study confirmed a link with progression to ESKD for UACR and 24-h urinary protein excretion but no such relationship with mortality, indicating that the study was likely inadequately powered to detect an association.

Our study is limited by being a single-centre study with a relatively small number of patients, the majority being white males. Despite 270 patients initially enrolled, only 144 completed all three baseline proteinuria measurements. We measured eGFR change over 5-years, rather than 2-years, which is a generally more accepted surrogate endpoint. The proportion of patients with nephrotic range proteinuria was small (12.5%), so our results should only be generalised to CKD patients with non-nephrotic range proteinuria. The strengths of the study are that this was a prospective cohort with very low numbers of loss to follow-up. There was a standardised urine collection procedure, and we only analysed fresh urine sample specimens. We captured all three commonly used measures of proteinuria for each participant and obtained objective and clinically relevant outcomes.

### The urine protein / creatinine ratio as a reliable indicator of 24-h urine protein excretion across different levels of renal function and proteinuria: the TUNARI prospective study [^112EGcB6]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

We stratified renal function, specifically creatinine clearance, into three groups: group 1, if 10 to < 30 mL/min, group 2, if 30 to 60 mL/min, and group 3 if > 60 mL/min. We also compared both methods of proteinuria according to the level of proteinuria (< 0.3 g/day, 0.3–3.5 g/day, and > 3.5 g/day). Additionally, we conducted a comparison of 24-hUP and PCR levels in terms of percentage concordance within specific proteinuria categories (Table 5). We performed an additional subgroup analysis (second phase sample vs. first phase), as well as compared the first urine sample of all patients with all samples (Supplementary Tables 1–2 and Supplementary Fig. 1A-B), where there were no notable changes. The inclusion of these additional samples helped us to increase the power of our analyses and did not represent a potential bias. Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS full form version 25.0 and R version 4.1.1.

Albuminuria and proteinuria assessment in HIV-infected persons — detection of albuminuria or proteinuria is the most common method of detecting kidney damage, and KDIGO guidelines recommend albuminuria as the preferred marker for staging CKD. Urine dipstick provides a semiquantitative measure but can substantially underestimate or overestimate true protein excretion depending on hydration status. Twenty-four–hour urine collections are the reference standard for measuring urinary excretion of albumin or protein; the adequacy of a 24-hour collection can be assessed against expected creatinine excretion of 20–25 and 15–20 mg/kg/day in men and women, respectively. The most clinically useful methods for quantifying excretion are the albumin-to-creatinine and the protein-to-creatinine ratios performed on random urine samples; albumin-to-creatinine ratios from random samples (ideally first morning) correlate closely with 24-hour collections. On average, humans excrete approximately 1 g of creatinine in the urine each day, so albumin or protein to creatinine ratios correspond to total daily excretion.

Urine albumin reporting and terminology — reporting albumin or total protein as a ratio to urine creatinine helps account for concentration variability in spot samples, but direct conversion from albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) to albumin excretion rate (AER) is cautioned: "Assuming a creatinine excretion of 1 g/d, an ACR of 1,000 mg/g would translate to an albumin excretion rate (AER) of 1,000 mg/d. However, this assumption is not correct". Implementation notes that "Clinicians may be resistant to switching from urine protein to urine albumin", and the commentary states, "we endorse the elimination of 'microalbuminuria' and 'macroalbuminuria' from the diagnostic testing lexicon".

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2021 KDIGO clinical practice guideline for the management of glomerular diseases [^111mmo9a]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2023). High credibility.

Diagnosis of nephrotic syndrome in children — urine protein-to-creatinine ratio (UPCR) and albumin thresholds: The substitution of spot UPCR for the 24-hour urine collection has been established as the standard of care for children, with nephrotic-range proteinuria defined as first morning UPCR of ≥ 2 g/g. Whereas the 2012 KDIGO guideline maintained albumin ≤ 2.5 g/dL, the current guideline suggests serum albumin ≤ 3 g/dl; however, we suggest continuing to use the definition of nephrotic syndrome for children in the absence of evidence to support a change to a higher cutoff. It is unknown whether children with nephrotic-range proteinuria and less severe hypoalbuminemia (albumin of 2.6–2.9 g/dL) have similar pathology or treatment responses, and this has not been studied in prospective clinical trials. Practice Point 4.1.1 states that the definitions relating to nephrotic syndrome in children are based on the clinical characteristics outlined in Figure 39.

Monitoring lupus nephritis activity — The gold standard for assessing proteinuria, the 24-hour urine collection, is challenging to implement in clinical practice; random urine protein-to-creatinine ratios are usually adequate. The first void of the day sample is the most accurate for the spot urine collection but may not be feasible, and unexpected results on random testing should be followed by a 24-hour collection, especially before any change in therapy. In people with LN who have not achieved CRR, we strongly recommend quantifying proteinuria at least every 3 months; in people with LN in sustained clinical renal remission, we strongly recommend quantifying proteinuria every 3–6 months.

### Proteinuria and hematuria are associated with acute kidney injury and mortality in critically ill patients: a retrospective observational study [^115cfhYD]. BMC Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Proteinuria and hematuria are both important health issues; however, the nature of the association between these findings and acute kidney injury (AKI) or mortality remains unresolved in critically ill patients.

Methods

Proteinuria and hematuria were measured by a dipstick test and scored using a scale ranging from a negative result to 3+ in 1883 patients admitted to the intensive care unit. AKI was defined according to the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines. The odds ratios (ORs) for AKI and 3-year mortality were calculated after adjustment for multiple covariates according to the degree of proteinuria or hematuria. For evaluating the synergistic effect on mortality among proteinuria, hematuria, and AKI, the relative excess risk due to interaction (RERI) was used.

Results

Proteinuria and hematuria increased the ORs for AKI: the ORs of proteinuria were 1.66 (±), 1.86 (1+), 2.18 (2+), and 4.74 (3+) compared with non-proteinuria; the ORs of hematuria were 1.31 (±), 1.58 (1+), 2.63 (2+), and 2.52 (3+) compared with non-hematuria. The correlations between the mortality risk and proteinuria or hematuria were all significant and graded (Ptrend < 0.001). There was a relative excess risk of mortality when both AKI and proteinuria or hematuria were considered together: the synergy indexes were 1.30 and 1.23 for proteinuria and hematuria, respectively.

Conclusions

Proteinuria and hematuria are associated with the risks of AKI and mortality in critically ill patients. Additionally, these findings had a synergistic effect with AKI on mortality.

### Can urine dipstick predict an elevated serum creatinine? [^116C6eKa]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

Chart review studies have suggested that point-of-care urine dipstick testing may accurately predict an elevation in serum creatinine (Cr). We aimed to prospectively evaluate the test characteristics of proteinuria/hematuria in predicting elevated serum Cr.

Methods

A prospective, observational study was conducted between March 2007 and June 2008 at 2 affiliated, urban hospitals with an annual emergency department census of 150,000. Patients undergoing laboratory urinalysis, point-of-care urine dipstick, and a serum chemistry panel were enrolled. Trained research assistants collected data on consecutive patients 18 hours per day using preformatted data forms and entry into an anonymized Access (Microsoft, Seattle, Wash) database. Demographic baseline variables including age, sex, chief complaint, vital signs, and source of sample (catheter vs "clean catch") were also collected. An elevated Cr level was defined as greater than 1.3 based on the laboratory reference range. Standard statistical methods were used to calculate diagnostic test operating characteristics of proteinuria or hematuria as a predictor of elevated serum Cr.

Results

Five thousand four hundred sixteen subjects were enrolled with 28.3% male and a mean age of 50.2 years. Elevated serum Cr greater than 1.3 mg/dL was found in 13.9% (755/5416) of subjects. The sensitivity of either proteinuria or hematuria for elevated Cr was 82.5% (95% confidence interval, 80%-85%) and specificity was 34.4% (95% CI, 33%-36%). Positive predictive value was 16.9% (95% CI, 16%-18%) and negative predictive value was 92.4% (95% CI, 91–94%). The likelihood ratio for a positive test was 1.3 (95% CI, 1.1–1.5), and the likelihood ratio for a negative test was 0.5 (95% CI, 0.3–0.8).

Conclusions

Although negative predictive value was high, the presence of proteinuria/hematuria was only moderately predictive of elevated serum Cr level.

### Contemporary test performance of the random urine protein-to-creatinine ratio [^114kTf9Y]. American Journal of Perinatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

The random urine protein-to-creatinine ratio (UPCR) is a screening test used for predicting clinically significant proteinuria (urine protein ≥ 300mg) during pregnancy. No consensus exists on the optimal random UPCR cutoff for performing follow-up 24 hour urine (24H) total protein collection. We aim to evaluate the test performance of random UPCR in predicting proteinuria in a contemporary cohort.

Study Design

This was a retrospective cohort study of pregnant patients at our institution from 2014 to 2018 with a random UPCR and follow-up 24H protein collection. The primary analysis estimated the test characteristics (sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values) of using random UPCR for the detection of proteinuria defined as urine protein ≥ 300mg on 24H protein collection. UPCR cutoffs from 0.10 to 0.30mg/dL were evaluated, receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve was constructed, and area under the curve (AUC) was determined. A secondary analysis examined the correlation between UPCR and 24H protein using least squares regression and Pearson correlation.

Results

Paired UPCR and 24H collection results were available for 1,120 patients. Mean gestational age at time of UPCR was 31.1 ± 5.1 weeks and 687 (61.3%) of patients had a 24H ≥ 300mg. UPCR < 0.10mg/dL effectively excluded proteinuria ≥ 300mg on 24H collection, while UPCR ≥ 0.18mg/dL correctly classifies proteinuria with 91% sensitivity, 57% specificity, 77% positive predictive value, and 79% negative predictive value. UPCR ≥ 1.07mg/dL had 100% specificity for 24 hour proteinuria. The area under ROC curve was 0.86. UPCR and 24H collection were highly correlated with a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.85. After our institution lowered the threshold to obtain a 24H from UPCR ≥ 0.20mg/dL to ≥ 0.10mg/dL in May 2017, the percentage of patients meeting criteria for 24H collection increased from 57.8 to 84.4%.

Conclusion

The AUC and Pearson correlation suggest random UPCR is a high performance test for the prediction of proteinuria on 24H. Optimal test performance is dependent upon clinical consideration and upon the implications of the disease or condition. A random UPCR screen positive threshold of 0.18mg/dL maximizes sensitivity to identify clinically significant proteinuria.

Key Points

· Random urine protein to creatinine ratio is a high performance test for proteinuria. · A random UPCR threshold of 0.18mg/dL maximizes sensitivity to identify proteinuria. · Optimal test performance is dependent on the disease or clinical condition.

### Predictive value of spot versus 24-hour measures of proteinuria for death, end-stage kidney disease or chronic kidney disease progression [^1179eHL9]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion

In conclusion, our study supports the current clinical practice of collecting spot UACR or UPCR for prognostic information in patients with stable CKD with non-nephrotic range proteinuria. All three measures of proteinuria were similarly predictive of hard clinical outcomes over 5 years, defined as a composite of death, ESKD and > 30% decline in eGFR. The evidence is less certain when we consider each outcome individually. In a bid to assess the utility of UACR or UPCR as surrogate measures of hard outcomes, future research should focus on whether changes in the quantity of proteinuria over time in response to treatment or natural history, is predictive of a similar change in the risk of hard outcomes.

### Prevalence of microalbuminuria and diagnostic value of dipstick proteinuria in outpatients from HIV clinics in bukavu, the democratic republic of Congo [^1172z55o]. BMC Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

The results of our study suggest that the urine dipstick may not be an adequate tool for screening for proteinuria in HIV-positive patients. As a screening test, the sensitivity (60%) and specificity (61%) of a single dipstick is poor. In fact, at lower levels of proteinuria (30 to 299 mg/g), a threshold of 1+ dipstick had a false-negative rate of 47.6%. Therefore, nearly 1 in 2 patients with proteinuria in this range may not be recognized and may have delayed workup and treatment. In addition, the proportion of false positives was 36%. Consequently, one to 3 patients with positive dipstick (1+) could be falsely considered to be at high cardiovascular and kidney risk.

Several studies reported the poor sensitivity of dipstick testing to identify early renal disease in HIV-population, hypertensive and diabetic patients. A recent study has demonstrated that the sensitivity of dipstick test, may be affected by urinary concentration. In addition, dipstick tests may miss about one out of five people with kidney disease, and positive dipstick test results for proteinuria may have to be confirmed by other laboratory tests. In fact, in a study of 166 HIV-infected persons who underwent both a urine dipstick and a spot urine protein-to-creatinine ratio within a 48-hour period, 21% of those with low but overt proteinuria (300 to 900 mg/g creatinine) were not detected by urine dipstick. So, in individuals at renal risk, such as HIV + patients, the search for microalbuminuria is recommended when the dipstick is negative. Furthermore, the recent Kidney Disease Initiative and Global Outcome (KDIGO) CKD Guidelines recommend, in individuals with proteinuria by dipstick, to perform confirmatory protein quantification within 3 months. Defining proteinuria as a positive urine dipstick test on two occasions could have reduced the false positive rate in our study, but probably at the expense of an even higher false negative rate.

Proteinuria evaluation

Dipstick urinalysis was performed using spontaneously voided fresh urine that was analyzed within a few minutes after collection. Urinalysis was not performed in subjects who were menstruating or exhibiting symptoms of UTI or vaginal discharge. The results were interpreted by one physician and were scored as (−) when no staining was observed, (±) when weak staining was observed, and 1+, 2+, 3+, or 4+ when mild-to-strong staining was observed. Proteinuria was defined as 1+ or greater. However, the quantification of proteinuria was not performed in the routine screening test. For patients who had proteinuria at the initial test, follow-up test was recommended within 1 or 2 weeks. Persistent proteinuria was confirmed when repeat testing also revealed proteinuria ≥ 1+. For second test, proteinuria was quantified using protein-to-creatinine ratio (UPCR) and albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR). The clinical diagnosis of proteinuria was made by each physician based on previous history, clinical features, and laboratory findings regardless of whether a renal biopsy was performed or not.

Statistical analysis

Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 18.0 (SPSS Inc. Chicago, IL, USA). All variables were expressed as the mean ± SD or median with ranges, unless otherwise indicated. Differences between two groups were analyzed by an independent t -test for continuous variables or the Fischer's exact test for categorical data. The receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve was constructed for evaluating the relationship between pulse pressure and proteinuria and the areas under the curve (AUC) were calculated. Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to find significant determinants for proteinuria. In multivariate models, age, smoking, BMI, systolic BP, pulse pressure, cholesterol, presence of metabolic syndrome and eGFR CKD-EPI were included. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

CLINICAL AND BIOCHEMICAL ASSESSMENT

Proteinuria

We recommend measurement of low-molecular-weight proteinuria in a male with persisting, non-orthostatic proteinuria (Grade B, strong).

Comment

Proteinuria in DD primarily reflects the impaired reabsorption of filtered proteins in the proximal tubule. Proteinuria is thus 'tubular' in origin and predominated by low-molecular-weight proteinuria. Nevertheless, proteinuria in the nephrotic range is observed in about one-half of DD patients and includes substantial amounts of albumin, probably reflecting the albumin that is physiologically filtered and not reabsorbed in the proximal tubule. Therefore, plasma albumin levels are typically normal or near normal and patients with DD do not have nephrotic syndrome (see also section Diagnosis, above).

The choice of marker for low-molecular-weight proteinuria depends mainly on local availability. Retinol-binding protein has been reported to have the highest sensitivity and specificity for tubular proteinuria. β 2 -Microglobulin may be degraded by bacteria in the urine and is unstable in acidic pH. Age-specific reference values for albumin/creatinine and low-molecular-weight protein/creatinine should be used. Commonly, at least a 5-fold increase is regarded as diagnostic, although it will be much higher in most patients. An α 1 -microglobulin/creatinine ratio above 120 mg/g (13.6 mg/mmol) has high accuracy in separating DD from glomerular disease. The use of bivariate graphs plotting the urinary low-molecular-weight protein/creatinine ratio against the albumin/creatinine ratio is very helpful to identify patients with DD and female carriers.

If specific low-molecular-weight proteinuria markers are not available, a urine protein electrophoresis or the ratio between albumin and total protein in the urine can be used as an indirect indicator for a glomerular or tubular aetiology of the proteinuria: glomerular proteinuria is non-specific and thus the ratio of albumin to total protein in the urine should be roughly the same as in plasma (i.e. > 40%). In contrast, in tubular proteinuria albumin typically makes up < 40% of total proteins in the urine. An albumin/total protein ratio cut-off of 21% had acceptable accuracy to differentiate DD from glomerular proteinuria.

### Proteinuria or albuminuria as markers of kidney and cardiovascular disease risk: an individual patient-level meta-analysis [^116KmVAX]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Urinary albumin-creatinine ratio (UACR) and urinary protein-creatinine ratio (UPCR) are both used in clinical practice to diagnose and monitor chronic kidney disease (CKD). Which measure exhibits stronger associations with clinical outcomes and whether this varies by patient characteristics are unknown.

Objective

To assess and compare the performance of UACR and UPCR across CKD-related clinical outcomes.

Design

Individual patient-level meta-analysis.

Setting

38 research and clinical cohorts.

Participants

148994 participants with same-day measurements of UACR and UPCR.

Measurements

We quantified the associations of UACR and UPCR with subsequent clinical outcomes, including kidney failure and cardiovascular events, using Cox proportional hazards regression. Analyses were done in each cohort, followed by random-effects meta-analysis. Subgroups included those based on severity of proteinuria, type 2 diabetes, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2, and glomerular disease.

Results

There were 148994 participants and 9773 kidney failure events during a median of 3.8 years of follow-up. Higher UACR and UPCR both had a log-linear association with increased risk for kidney failure. The association with kidney failure was somewhat stronger for UACR (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] per SD increment, 2.55 [95% CI, 2.36 to 2.74]) than UPCR (HR, 2.40 [CI, 2.28 to 2.53]; P for comparison < 0.001). Results were consistent to slightly stronger in subgroups with UACR greater than 30 mg/g, UPCR greater than 500 mg/g, eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2, diabetes, and glomerular disease. Associations between UACR and UPCR were generally similar for cardiovascular outcomes but favored UACR in subgroups with moderately to severely elevated UACR.

Limitation

Assessment of UACR and UPCR in spot urine samples.

Conclusion

Overall, UACR was more strongly associated with kidney failure than UPCR (particularly in subgroups with higher UACR), supporting the use of UACR rather than UPCR to diagnose and risk-stratify patients.

There were 121 995 individuals (80%) with eGFR ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 (mean eGFR 81 (SD 17) mL/min/1.73 m 2) and 30 295 individuals (20%) with eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 (mean 52 (SD 7) mL/min/1.73 m 2) at baseline (table 4). Only 439 individuals (0.3%) had eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 at baseline. Individuals with reduced eGFR tended to be older (68 v 63) and were more likely to be women (60% v 40%) (table 4). Data on urinary protein excretion were available for 37 161 individuals, mostly from trials that compared ACE inhibitor based regimens with placebo. Proteinuria was present in 2500 (7%) of these individuals, and patients with proteinuria were more likely to be men (66% v 55%) and tended to have a higher serum creatinine concentration at baseline (91 μmol/L v 86 μmol/L). The baseline characteristics of each trial included were well balanced between the randomised treatment allocations (appendix table 2). There was some evidence of publication bias (Egger's test P = 0.05) across the studies (appendix fig 4). A trim and fill analysis, however, did not change the pooled estimate.

### Urinalysis: a comprehensive review [^117XeZs7]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

A complete urinalysis includes physical, chemical, and microscopic examinations. Midstream clean collection is acceptable in most situations, but the specimen should be examined within two hours of collection. Cloudy urine often is a result of precipitated phosphate crystals in alkaline urine, but pyuria also can be the cause. A strong odor may be the result of a concentrated specimen rather than a urinary tract infection. Dipstick urinalysis is convenient, but false-positive and false-negative results can occur. Specific gravity provides a reliable assessment of the patient's hydration status. Microhematuria has a range of causes, from benign to life threatening. Glomerular, renal, and urologic causes of microhematuria often can be differentiated by other elements of the urinalysis. Although transient proteinuria typically is a benign condition, persistent proteinuria requires further work-up. Uncomplicated urinary tract infections diagnosed by positive leukocyte esterase and nitrite tests can be treated without culture.

AASLD and AST adult liver transplant guideline — proteinuria monitoring recommends urinary protein quantification using the concentration ratio of protein to creatinine in a spot urine specimen and states it should be evaluated at least once yearly (grade 1, level B). The rationale notes that increased proteinuria (spot protein-to-creatinine ratio > 0.3) may be absent even in the presence of advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) because of the antiproteinuric effect of calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs), and that proteinuria is best assessed by measuring the concentration ratio of protein to creatinine in a spot urine specimen.

Screening and diagnosis of diabetic kidney disease — ACR should be measured in first-void urine samples, but if a random urine specimen is abnormal, the second test could be done in a first-voided morning sample obtained within the subsequent 3 to 6 months. Screening for microalbuminuria in patients with type 2 diabetes, if leading to multifactorial interventions, can result in reduced risks of cardiovascular events, progression of albuminuria, and development or progression of retinopathy and neuropathy, whereas similar studies in patients with type 1 diabetes are lacking. International control between laboratories should be established, and there should also be standardized reporting of ACRs with internationally agreed-upon categorical definitions.

Proteinuria

Dipstick analysis was performed on 220 urine specimens. Proteinuria of 1+ or more was detected on 36/220 (16%) specimens. Nineteen of the 36 children met the criteria for repeat urine dipstick analysis. Seventeen of these 19 children (89%) came for repeat urinalysis and 11 had persistent proteinuria. These specimens were sent for urine protein and creatinine quantitation. The Upr/cr in the 11 samples was greater than 0.2, giving a prevalence of persistent proteinuria of 11/220 (5%). Six of the 11 children had intermediate proteinuria while 5 children had nephrotic range proteinuria. Only 2 children with persistent proteinuria had oedema (one had facial oedema only and one had bilateral pitting pedal oedema). One child with persistent proteinuria had a raised diastolic blood pressure. Six children with persistent proteinuria also had haematuria on dipstick analysis and 3 of these children had the haematuria confirmed on microscopy. Four of the 11 children with persistent proteinuria had reduced eGFR.

Persistent proteinuria was more likely to occur in children with WHZ < −2 compared to children with WHZ ≥ −2 [p = 0.0005) (Table 1)]. Stunting and underweight did not have a significant effect on persistent proteinuria.

### Use of a first-line urine protein-to-creatinine ratio strip test on random urines to rule out proteinuria in patients with chronic kidney disease [^1144hApu]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Urine protein strip tests are often used in the ward or clinic as first-line measures of proteinuria. The ability of a semi-quantitative meter-read strip test for the protein:creatinine ratio, Multistix* PRO 10LS (Siemens Medical Solutions, Tarrytown, USA), was assessed as a first-line test to exclude significant proteinuria in the monitoring of patients with established chronic kidney disease.

Methods

Eighty-six patients attending a hospital renal outpatient clinic collected three random urine samples during a 24-h period. Random urine protein:creatinine ratios measured by the strip test were compared to the laboratory estimation of 24-h protein excretion on that same day.

Results

At significant protein excretion of 0.3 g/24 h, the strips elicited negative predictive values in the range of 91.2–94.1% and negative likelihood ratios of 0.01–0.12, using all the random urines. Receiver-operator characteristic curve analysis also demonstrated good performance with all samples.

Conclusions

The strip test allows the physician to rule out significant proteinuria at the patient consultation on a random urine sample, obviating the need for specially collected samples, and with the added benefit of reducing the need for a lengthy and costly quantitative laboratory follow-up by approximately 40–48%.

### Clinical practice guideline on pregnancy and renal disease [^111hQ8aS]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

24-h urine collection is time-consuming and subject to inadequacies in collection. Outside of pregnancy, uPCR and uACR are highly correlated with 24-h urine collection and are more convenient in clinical practice. Pregnant cohorts show a similar correlation between 24-h urine protein excretion and both uPCR and uACR. A prospective multi-centre cohort study of 959 pregnant women after 20 weeks' gestation with hypertension and trace protein or more on urine dipstick found that both uPCR and uACR could be both used as rule out tests for preeclampsia with no additional benefit from 24-h urine collection.

There is on-going debate as to whether uPCR or uACR should be preferentially used for the quantification of proteinuria in pregnancy. In non-pregnant patients with CKD, uACR is the investigation of choice as it provides greater sensitivity at lower levels of proteinuria, although uPCR can be used as an alternative, particularly where uACR is 70 mg/mmol or greater. In contrast, uPCR is currently the most common test used to quantify proteinuria in pregnancy. A single centre experience of 181 pregnant women without CKD showed that uACR and uPCR were highly correlated to each other, with equivalent performance in the prediction of adverse pregnancy outcomes. More recent, larger, prospective cohort data from normal pregnancies show that although uACR and uPCR are comparable in performance, uACR had a significantly higher area under the receiver-operating curve (ROC) for the diagnosis of severe pre-eclampsia compared to local laboratory uPCR (ROC 0.89 versus 0.87, p = 0.004). However it remains unclear whether this small absolute difference translates into significant clinical benefit. Cost effectiveness for uACR over uPCR was also suggested, although 95% confidence intervals for the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio crossed zero due to significant uncertainty and the small difference in incremental cost and quality added life years. There are no published data on the predictive and/or diagnostic benefits of uACR compered to uPCR in pregnant women with CKD. It is therefore the consensus of the guideline group that the decision to use uACR or uPCR should be based on local obstetric experience ensuring a baseline measurement in early pregnancy in order to be able to recognise relative change in proteinuria in pregnancy. In women without pre-existing proteinuria, diagnostic performance equivalent to 30 mg/mmol of uPCR is achieved with a uACR cut-off of 8 mg/mmol.
